Aritz Aduriz was on the pitch for a total of three minutes. He had two touches and one shot, and with it produced the goal of a lifetime. What a hero. Goodnight and thanks for joining. It\u2019s been a pleasure. I\u2019ll leave you with this \u2026 What now for Barcelona? Messi is still injured. Suarez is likely to be joining him on the sidelines. Coutinho is going on loan to Bayern. Griezmann started very slowly. And Dembele still flatters to deceive. De Jong looked good and his revolving midfield partnership with Rakitic in the second half showed real sigs of promise. But Real Madrid and Atletico will be licking their lips now. Some interesting facts about Aduriz and his goal \u2026 Pictures of Aduriz\u2019s stunning volley have been painfully slow to emerge, but I have unearthed an image from Euro 2016 to give you an idea of his body shape. The result was not the same, but the execution similar \u2026 There\u2019ll be partying tonight in Basque country \u2026 Simon McMahon didn\u2019t think this would happen, no one did. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d he wrote midway through the second half. \u201cAll things considered, I think Athletic Bilbao will probably be happy with a point. We can\u2019t all be like Dundee United and beat the Catalans every time we play now, can we?\u201d Back to San Mames and the place is rocking. It wasn\u2019t the greatest game and Barcelona looked the most likely winners but only one side had their brilliant talisman to call on. Lionel Messi could not have produced anything better than the sublime scissor-kick Aritz Aduriz unleashed after launching his 38-year-old frame high into the air in the 88th minute. The first goal of the season in La Liga might just turn out to be the best. The champions start with a defeat. The hero of Bilbao has cemented his legend for ever more. Let me know your thoughts. Bayern have also stuttered on day one in the Bundesliga. Can Coutinho save them? Andy Lynam has an update via email. \u201cDespite Lewandowski\u2019s VAR-assisted pen on 60 to save the game for Bayern, their inability to get the winner will give much succour to BVB and Leipzig,\u201d he reports. \u201cThey should have had the game sewn up midway through the first half but Hertha\u2019s double-strike before half-time really rattled them. Bayern dominated and are clearly stuffed with talent, but the game showed that their confidence is surprisingly fragile. Let\u2019s see what Coutinho can add.\u201d I\u2019m already looking forward to Sid\u2019s column on Monday \u2026 Sid Lowe wrote this on Aritz Aduriz in 2016. He shows no sign of letting up. That was an incredible finish to the game and provides a wonderful start to the season. This will be Aduriz\u2019s final season. He is 38 years old and a legend at this club. But never can he have scored a better goal than that. Shades of Rooney\u2019s legendary strike against City. Athletic shock the champions on the opening day. 92 min: Barca probe, Alba centres and Athletic clear. 91 min: There will be three minutes of added time. Capa is played into space down the right. The ball is bouncing but he caresses it first time into the centre. Aduriz, on the pitch for less than a minute, rises and unleashes a sensational bicycle kick. The ball arrows past Ter Stegen in a flash. What a goal. Simply stunning. That is a stunning overhead kick winner. 87 min: De Jong snuffs out the danger coolly when Capa escapes briefly down the right. Aduriz comes on for Williams. The crowd roar the veteran\u2019s introduction. Can be be the difference maker? 85 min: The De Jong-Rakitic axis is working smoothly, maybe a sign of things to come over the season. But the cutting edge is lacking. 84 min: The Dembele-Alba combination releases the flying left-back into space. He pulls the ball back but Griezmann\u2019s shot is blocked. The corner is recycled to Rafinha to cross but Griezmann\u2019s tame header floats over. Here is the full story on Coutinho to Bayern. Might they reconsider after this \u2026 80 min: Rafinha dribbles inside the box, waltzes past a couple of defenders and unleashes a shot but still Barcelona cannot breach the home defence. 78 min: Barcelona are half the team without Messi. And even less without Suarez. 76 min: Dembele comes inside and plays Alba into the space he has vacated on the left. Athletic clear. Barcelona bring on Carles P\u00e9rez for Sergi Roberto. Perez is a 21-year-old right winger who has only played 17 minutes of first-team football for Barcelona. 74 min: Barca are camped in the Athletic half. The hosts cannot get out. Gareth Ramsay can update us on the Barcelona strip. \u201cRe the first-half discussion of Barca\u2019s kit,\u201d he explains, \u201cit is actually an update of this 70s classic (with Cruyff looking as beautiful as ever): https://images.app.goo.gl/T1iXqERZufwnesbKA 70 min: More Barca probing almost gives Griezmann his first sight of goal. Athletic get a foot in but the ball breaks to Rakitic. It\u2019s a chance inside the box but he lashes over wastefully. The pressure is building. 68 min: Alba, Dembele and Rafinha combine nicely down the left but Athletic snuff them out. They hunt in packs, and make it very tough to break through. 66 min: De Marcos is off and Oihan Sancet is on. The crowd go wild. They love a young player and clearly have high hopes for the 19-year-old midfielder. Not everybody is impressed with Coutinho\u2019s imminent move to Bayern. \u201cKlopp said to Coutinho: \u2018Stay here and they will end up building a statue in your honour, leave and you\u2019ll just be another player,\u2019 emails Mike65ie. \u201cHe was right.\u201d 61 min: The resultant free-kick involves a back-heel and a wild slash and troubles nobody. 60 min: Pique is booked for a swinging arm into Raul Garcia\u2019s face. The Barca man is incensed. It\u2019s the first yellow of the game. 59 min: Barca win a free-kick 45 yards from goal. Dembele drifts it in and when it is headed out Rafinha lashes a first-time volley well wide. 58 min: De Jong is dropping between the centre-backs to start attacks from deep, in the style of Busquets. It has injected a bit of tempo into Barcelona\u2019s play. 57 min: A huge punt forward from goal sends Williams clear of Lenglet. The angle is not great and the rapid forward\u2019s effort is weak. 54 min: Lopez fires in a long ranger. It\u2019s smartly hit but always going over. The action is hotting up. 53 min: This time Dembele creates something. A clever ball nutemgs his marker and allows Rafinha a sight of goal. The substitute drives towards the near post but it\u2019s deflected wide off Nunez. 51 min: Pique pumps a very un-Barcelona like long ball forward. It\u2019s cleared but comes to Demebele on the left. A couple of nice shimmies buy him space but again he plays a nothing ball. 49 min: Alba was exposed defensively a couple of times in the first half but a typical burst down the left wins a corner. Rakitic darts on to Dembele\u2019s inswinging delivery but his flicked header has too much on it and drifts over the bar. 47 min: Rakitic has immediately started to dictate play, rolling the ball under his studs like his fellow Croatian Prosinecki used to, and playing probing first time passes into the front men. Peep! Peep! The second half begins with a nice turn from De Jong and Dembele giving the ball away. Rakitic is coming on for Alena. Barcelona need to get hold of midfield. Coutinho to Bayern Munich is on! The Barcelona director Guillermo Amor has confirmed a deal is close. \u201cWe can confirm that there is an agreement in principle for the loan of Coutinho to Bayern,\u201d he said before tonight\u2019s match. \u201cWe just have to finalise the deal.\u201d The European transfer window is open until Monday. Follow all the deals across Europe\u2019s top five leagues with our brilliant interactive \u2026 Half-time emails \u201cHope you\u2019re doing well and apologies if this bothers with your live commentary,\u201d writes Vikas Tripathi. \u201cI am late to the party but please pass on my very best wishes to Nicky and congratulate her on her decision to come out. I\u2019ve always found her work insightful and deeply enriching and I am looking forward to very much of the same. Cheers!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s half-time in the game I\u2019m watching, Huddersfield v Fulham,\u201d reports JR from Illinois. \u201cNo score in that one. They\u2019re mostly just kicking each other. It\u2019s pretty good. I thought I\u2019d check in on this game. Has Suarez been looking hungry? And yes, by that I mean does it look like he might bite someone.\u201d Suarez was looking angry rather than hungry when he was forced off, JR. He may be biting into something now though. Half-time! It\u2019s o-o at the break. Athletic Bilbao have been the better, more urgent side, but Barcelona have hit the woodwork twice. Crucially, though, they\u2019ve also lost Suarez to injury, and Messi is not available. This could go either way. 45 min: There will be one minute of added time. 44 min: Rafinha hits the junction of post and bar! He works a yard of space and wraps the inside of his left foot around the ball from way outside the area. Unai Sim\u00f3n is nowhere and the ball screeches against the woodwork. That\u2019s very unlucky. 43 min: Griezmann pops up on the right. He\u2019s looking brighter, but a pitch map of Inaki Williams\u2019s runs show he\u2019s on course to break record for yards covered. Y0u can see why Manchester United were interested. 40 min: Griezmann is caught offside. It looked miles off, but I don\u2019t think it was. He would have been clear. 38 min: Suarez can\u2019t continue and is replaced by Rafinha. That\u2019s a blow, especially with no Messi, but will at least allow Griezmann to move into the central striking role. 36 min: Capa breaks free of Alba after a clever one two. he pulls it back fro Raul Garcia but he\u2019s stretching when he shoots and the attempt lacks power. 35 min: Suarez looks to be in some pain after taking a knock. He gets some treatment on the side while Williams races down the left. He puts a cross in but Barca see it out and Ter Stegen rises to claim the second ball. 32 min: Suarez hits the post! A terrible back pass from Lopez puts Suarez clear. He\u2019s coming back to try to get onside so swivels on it and fires an instant shot off on his left. It crashes against the inside of the post and away. 31 min: Unai Lopez breaks forward from midfield and lets fly from 30 yards. It moves in the air but Ter Stegen is up to the task and drops on it. 29 min: It\u2019s a slow burner here, but luckily Andy Lynam has news from the Bundesliga opener in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019re heading for a shock,\u201d he writes. \u201cHalf-time, and Hertha\u2019s two rapid strikes puncture the carnival atmosphere created when Lewandowski put the champs ahead. Bayern looking fearsome in attack but vulnerable at the back.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s on-loan midfielder Marko Grujic has got Hertha\u2019s second I can tell you. 24 min: A Suarez backheel goes astray. Not long after Dembele is robbed. Griezmann is playing so wide and deep on the left. This front three looks great on paper but without Messi they seem lost. 21 min: Barca pass, pass and pass again but not a forward ball in sight. Eventually they give it away. \u201cThe Barca kit looks like a drunken reinvention of the Crystal Pace kit from the late 70s/early 80s,\u201d Christopher Lawton says via email. They\u2019re playing a bit like them too. 18 min: A clever reverse pass from Dembele puts Griezmann in a bit of space on the right of the penalty area. He backheels inside but no one is there. All Griezmann has done so far is upset the crowd. 16 min: Williams races clear on to a straight ball over the top. He\u2019s past the last defender and takes one touch on his knee before shooting with his right foot. Ter Stegen stands up before plunging to his left to make a smart but comfortable save. 14 min: Alena shows his class with a lovely turn in midfield. There are high hopes for the graceful 21-year-old midfielder. 12 min: The crowd whistle and shout after a late tackle from Griezmann. That\u2019s one for each side. Lenglet clears the free-kick. 10 min: The hosts are pressing with some verve and this time it is De Jong who loses the ball to leave Williams in space again. Barca finally get some possession and find Alba on the left. He forces a corner, then another but it comes to nothing. 7 min: Williams is gifted the ball between the lines after a wayward ball from Dembele. He lets fly but Ter Stegen leaps to his right and palms the ball out for a corner. That was a fine effort but Barcelona need to wake up quick. 6 min: Williams steals the ball off Alba and surges down the right. His centre is put out for a corner but De Jong clears. It\u2019s an underrated part of his game. His passing is supreme, but his screening of the defence is just as good. 4 min: A lovely weaving run from Williams leaves two Barcelona players chasing shadows. Unfortunately he\u2019s heading backwards but he\u2019ll be important tonight. Athletic have begun on the front foot. 2 min: De Jong gets a very late welcome to La Liga challenge from Raul Garcia. That didn\u2019t take long. Peep! Athletic get us under way at San Mames and immediately show their intentions with a long ball forward. It comes to nothing. Pre-match email \u201cIs Barcelona still cool?\u201d muses Charles Antaki. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone down steadily in the coolness stakes ever since they took cash for the front of the shirt and relegated Unicef to somewhere round the back. Subsequent designs have ranged from the quirky to the laughable and now the checkerboard squares have edged into simple naffness. Maybe the actual football will be entertaining.\u201d One man who does not seem to be going anywhere is Gareth Bale, despite his relationship with Zinedine Zidane seemingly having broken down beyond repair just days ago. Read the latest in that soap opera here \u2026 Philippe Coutinho is not even on the bench tonight, despite travelling with the squad. Reports suggest Bayern Munich are in talks with Barcelona about taking Coutinho on loan. Who would benefit most from that move? Email me with your thoughts. Real Madrid kick-off their season tomorrow, while Atl\u00e9tico begin on Sunday. Here are the opening fixtures in full \u2026 The most impressive article I\u2019ve read in a while was today\u2019s first person piece by our very own Nicky Bandini. The response has been touching and Rob Graham\u2019s email is typical. \u201cCan you pass on my, and hopefully a lot more than 1056 others, very best wishes to Nicky Bandini,\u201d he writes. \u201cA top class football writer, and writer in general as the beautiful piece proved.\u201d For those who missed it, here it is \u2026 San Mam\u00e9s is rocking, and these were the scenes an hour go as the fans made their way to the stadium \u2026 For the true lowdown on the new La Liga season, you will not get better than this from Sid Lowe \u2026 Barcelona have gone with a very young midfield for this game, with Rakitic and Busquets left on the bench by Valverde. A front three of Suarez, Dembele and Griezmann looks menacing though. For Athletic, I\u00f1aki Williams will lead the line and provide the main goal threat after signing a nine-year contract extension with a buy-out clause of \u00a3125m. Who knows, that may seem a snip in a couple of years? Athletic Bilbao: Unai Sim\u00f3n, Capa, Yeray, N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Yuri, Dani Garc\u00eda, Unai L\u00f3pez, De Marcos, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda, Muniain, Williams. Subs: Herrer\u00edn, Be\u00f1at, Larrazabal, Aduriz, Balenziaga, Vivian, Sancet Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Semedo, Piqu\u00e9, Lenglet, Alba, Ale\u00f1\u00e1, Roberto, De Jong, Su\u00e1rez, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Griezmann. Subs: Rakitic, Busquets, Rafinha, Umtiti, Junior, I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a, C. P\u00e9rez. La Liga is back, and back with a vengeance. Alarmed by the Premier League takeover of Europe\u2019s major competitions last season, Spain\u2019s top clubs have spent and spent big. Atl\u00e9tico have splashed \u20ac256m to revamp an ageing team while Real Madrid\u2019s total is closer to \u20ac300m. Frenkie de Jong and Antoine Griezmann lead the incomings at Barcelona and the battle to secure Neymar\u2019s signature is still raging. Barcelona are the champions and remain the team to beat but a trip to Athletic Bilbao is a tough way to start, especially without Lionel Messi. The Argentinian was injured in the Copa Am\u00e9rica and Ernesto Valverde has decided not to rush him back for the season\u2019s opener. How will Bar\u00e7a cope? Is Demb\u00e9le ready to step up? Will Griezmann slot in seamlessly after his controversial move from Atl\u00e9tico? Or can Athletic give the chasing pack an early shot in the arm? It\u2019s the Basques v the Catalans to see who will draw first blood in Spain\u2019s top division. Kick-off is 8pm BST."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
