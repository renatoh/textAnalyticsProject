Watson is expected to say: \u201cWe must bring the public back into this decision and we must argue strongly to remain in Europe. Our future doesn\u2019t need to be Brexit. We can change our future. But only if Labour makes the case for it \u2013 and we must.\u201d Corbyn has consistently resisted characterising Labour as a party for remain, insisting it must speak to both sides of the bitter divide in British politics. Launching his party\u2019s campaign for the European elections last month, he said: \u201cWe could allow ourselves to be defined only as remainers or leavers \u2013 labels that meant nothing to us only a few years ago. But where would that take us? Who wants to live in a country stuck in this endless loop?\u201d But Watson, will say Labour\u2019s support for EU membership has been \u201cwhispered, not shouted\u201d for too long. \u201cI don\u2019t support Europe despite being socialist; I support Europe because I am a socialist. Democratic socialism is achieving common causes by the strength of collective endeavour. That\u2019s what Europe is,\u201d he will say. \u201cThe core values of the EU are internationalism. Solidarity. Freedom. Those are British values. Those are Labour values.\u201d Labour sources insisted on Sunday night the shadow cabinet meeting had been postponed because several members were unable to attend. But frontbench remainers immediately suspected the leadership was seeking to avoid a confrontation. Corbyn and some close allies are still sceptical about a further shift towards remain, fearing it would be seen by leave voters as a betrayal, which could lose them the working-class vote for a generation. But since the party\u2019s disastrous showing in the European elections, when it came third behind the Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats on14% of the vote, pressure has been mounting for a decisive move towards backing a second referendum. As well as Watson from the social democratic wing of the party, and leftwing MPs such as Clive Lewis and Lloyd Russell-Moyle from campaign group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, the leadership faces a grassroots rebellion on the issue. There is a vigorous campaign for constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to pass motions demanding that Labour call for a referendum and back remain \u2013 which could be debated at party conference in the autumn. Some recent polls of Westminster voting intentions have shown Labour trailing behind the Lib Dems, whose forthright \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d message has helped them win over pro-remain voters from both the main parties. Corbyn made a minor but significant shift in the aftermath of the vote, saying Labour would now support \u201ca public vote on any deal\u201d \u2013 but he later said the prospect of a referendum was \u201csome way off\u201d. When the shadow cabinet meeting is rescheduled, Watson is likely to be supported by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry. Starmer told Labour members in an online discussion last week: \u201cThere are many in the Labour party who feel we need to be very clear about a second referendum and about making the case for remain. That\u2019s certainly what I\u2019m advocating \u2026 I hope we can resolve it pretty soon.\u201d Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn\u2019s stand-in for PMQs in favour of the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, after publicly criticising the party\u2019s Brexit stance at the European elections. \u201cWe were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear,\u201d she said after the results. Until recently, Corbyn could generally count on a majority against a referendum at shadow cabinet, but some leftwing shadow ministers who have previously been wary have edged towards backing the idea in certain circumstances, the Guardian understands, including the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, and the acting shadow international development secretary, Dan Carden. Burgon tweeted last week: \u201cLabour will do whatever it takes to stop an unelected Tory PM imposing no-deal on the country. That means a public vote or general election.\u201d However, several others, including Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, remain deeply sceptical, fearing the impact on leave voters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
