I\u2019m going to try and play an aggressive -- in aggressive tennis, you can play defensive with Rafa. Try to play the rallies, you know. Play rallies, apply pressure, serve well. It is all part of my -- it\u2019s part of the game that I want to play against Rafa. I think everyone has to play this way. I just have to be solid. Have to be more solid than him to win. I know that. I have to start strong and finish even stronger. Rafa after his loss to Dominic Thiem on Tuesday: Q.

I think playing like this I am confident that I can have my chances in the tournament. Hello! Welcome to our coverage of the penultimate day of round robin action at the ATP Finals. These final matches of the round robin stages can be so complicated with the semi-finalists often determined by set and game percentages. Thankfully, things are very simple this year and the winner of tonight\u2019s match between Rafael Nadal and Stefanos Tsitsipas will qualify for the semi-final in second place behind Dominic Thiem. Daniil Medvedev awaits. Nadal arrives in this final at an interesting moment. This is only his second tournament on hard courts since February. Despite the fact that he fell in two tiebreak sets against Thiem, he did so while playing some incredible tennis himself aside from on the most important moments deep in the two tiebreaks. After the match, he was satisfied despite the loss. The question is whether he can use it as a stepping stone to advance further in the tournament. Defending champion Tsitsipas has been struggling with a leg injury in recent weeks and although he took a set from Thiem, he was understandably more frustrated by his performance than Nadal. He rode his luck and demonstrated his mental fortitude in the following match as he recovered from match point down against Andrey Rublev to keep himself alive in the event. Now let\u2019s see what he can do against the very best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
