Tall, boyish and gangly, Ronan O'Gara does not look like the Munster prototype, but appearances belie an attitude which defines his side's rugby and makes today's Heineken Cup tie at Gloucester such a lip-smacking prospect. Many sides have slunk into Kingsholm, beaten by the Shed's intimidating reputation before their boots are even laced. Munster men are the opposite, packing their bags for hostile destinations with an enthusiasm and relish even Michael Palin cannot match. Leaving aside their two final defeats in three years - and Neil Back's illegal hand in the scrum to deny them last year is still an open sore - no one can remotely compete with their ratio of successful missions in \"impossible\" locations. That extraordinary semi-final win over Toulouse in Bordeaux in 2000 and last year's quarter-final epic at Stade Fran\u00e7ais spring to mind. \"It's something that's built into those of us from this area at a young age,\" says the 25-year-old O'Gara, choosing another man of Cork to illustrate his thesis. \"If we suffer knockdowns, we keep coming back for more. We're like Roy Keane. He epitomises everything about people from this area, how competitive we are.\" As with Keane, there is also a healthy scepticism for other people's sacred cows. \"We've seen the English league and, to be honest, it's over-rated,\" continues O'Gara. \"It's a big comment to make but, while we respect Leicester and Gloucester as outstanding sides, there are other teams we'd beat week-in and week-out. That's not us being cocky. I don't think we'd fear many of them here.\" Even Munster, however, recognise they now occupy the most fiendish of awayday pools. Nowhere in England can eclipse a packed Kingsholm for raw intensity while Perpignan's Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral, with its mesh fences and rabid Catalan support, is the toughest place to win in France. As for Munster's Thomond Park, that mystical grey Celtic cathedral in Limerick, the home side have yet to lose there in seven years of European rugby. If home form is near guaranteed, far more pertinent is how the three contenders will fare away from their fearsome lairs. Perpignan are erratic travellers, Gloucester have been unconvincing on the road. Munster? O'Gara and friends can scarcely wait to show how it is done. The Ireland centre Rob Henderson, a winner at Kingsholm with both his former clubs London Irish and Wasps, is among several players who disagree that losing coach Declan Kidney to Ireland and the retirement of Clohessy will halt the Munster bandwagon. He says: \"This team refuse to know when they're beaten. The opposition can be 20 points ahead with the crowd howling the place down and it wouldn't bother us. We'll keep fighting until the last whistle. We're a good team, a confident team and we don't mind where we are or who we're playing.\" Munster's new Australian coach Alan Gaffney, previously with Leinster, can scarcely believe what he has walked into. Had he not required his old warhorse Mick Galwey in the second-row today, Gaffney would still have wheeled the legendary 'Gaillimh' into the dressing-room before kick-off for motivational effect and he confirms his inherited squad have a unique spirit. \"I've asked Gaillimh what the secret is and he sincerely tells me he doesn't know,\" says Gaffney. \"I was talking to a guy the other day who reckons it goes back 100 years to when rugby started in Limerick and they were playing in the lanes. It's been there for a long, long time. I'd love to bottle it.\" The message on the back of Gaffney's T-shirt - \"If your friends don't support Munster, get new friends\" - sums up the ethos without recourse to those trendy focus groups who attempt to classify institutions in terms of food or drink. But if Leicester are pork pies and pints of best bitter, Munster are a crafty fag and a large Jameson's. The humour extends to today's game, with 1,000 Munster fans expected to travel. \"Is it true they're organising a kicking competition for the fans?\" someone asked. \"Will they be kicking a ball or each other?\" Galwey, for his part, recalls playing at Kingsholm in 1991 when the Irish national team met Gloucester in a pre-World Cup friendly \"in the days when you could have a good fight and get away with it.\" Ireland lost. Not taking Munster seriously, however, is a basic error. The new captain Jim Williams, a former Wallaby, says last year's final defeat to Leicester will \"haunt the guys years later.\" O'Gara, who has slotted 32 of 37 attempts at goal this season to counter criticism of a fallible kicking record under pressure, does not argue. He insists, though, that the \"dreadful disappointment\" of losing two finals has already been replaced by steely new professional intent. \"You've just got to keep knocking on the door and then, hopefully, you might get the bread. Hunger isn't a problem for us, it's always been in our make-up as Irish people. The greater the sense of being the underdog, the more we thrive. Kingsholm will obviously be intimidating but that eggs on the likes of us. Hopefully we can keep with them and see what they are made of in a close game. \"Teams seem to have wilted against them but Munster have never done that against anyone. When Declan was coach he was always conscious about the money supporters spent travelling to the away games. He always made a point of reminding us not to ruin their weekend.\" Anyone with a ticket today is guaranteed full value."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
