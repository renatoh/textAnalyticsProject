Alarmed by signs that Britain's malfunctioning banking system is starving consumers and businesses of credit, Alistair Darling gave Threadneedle Street clearance to begin creating money \u2013 the last-gasp measure used by Japan to end a decade of recession and deflation. The Bank said it would embark on quantitative easing next week, after its monetary policy committee cut the bank rate for the sixth time since the global financial system came close to collapse last October. The rate is now 0.5% \u2013 a level not seen before in the Bank's 315-year history. Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, said it was unlikely that bank rate could go any lower and policymakers would shift focus to creating money instead. \"We are very close to zero. What we are doing now is switching to injecting money into the economy directly.\" The move came as one of Gordon Brown's closest allies came closer to admitting that Labour had to bear some responsibility for the crisis. Ed Balls, the schools minister, said the government had failed to take enough action to rein in the City during the boom years. \"In retrospect we all underestimated the risks and we were nowhere near tough enough,\" Balls told Sky News. \"We need to learn from that and do it better in the future.\" King's blueprint was the result of three months' intensive activity at the Bank and the Treasury, with officials seeking advice from Tokyo and analysing the lessons of the US experiment with quantitative easing in the Great Depression. Darling has given the Bank permission to create \u00a3150bn \u2013 or 10% of the annual output of the economy \u2013 by purchasing government gilts and commercial assets. The first tranche will be bought on Wednesday. It hopes the cash injection will find its way into the hands of consumers and businesses, thereby boosting demand. With fresh evidence of the severity of the recession emerging today, King underlined the government's determination to boost growth over the coming months. He said there was a limit to how much fresh money could be injected into the economy in \"highly uncertain times\", but stressed that the Bank would have to reverse the policy when the economy recovered. King expressed confidence that the initiative would work but refused to predict when the recession would end. \"Nothing in life is ever certain. Changing interest rates is not certain. These measures, we think, will work in the long run. I can't be sure how long it will take.\" Both the Bank and the Treasury have become progressively gloomier about the prospects for the economy recently and Darling is considering a fresh package of budget measures to stimulate activity. Today's move was welcomed by the City and industry groups. Colin Ellis, of Daiwa Securities, said: \"It is very encouraging to see the Bank of England start with a big number \u2013 like the 1.5-point cut in rates last year there may be an element of 'shock and awe' at play. Today's measures are precisely the kind of bold, decisive action that the UK economy has been crying out for.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, welcomed the move, saying rate cuts had ceased to be fully effective. \"A swift move towards quantitative easing as a way of boosting money supply and lending directly is now the MPC's best bet.\" Four million people with tracker mortgages will see repayments fall following today's move. Lloyds TSB, Nationwide, Halifax, and Skipton building society are passing on the cut in full to people on standard variable rates. In the City, gilt prices rose sharply but the stockmarket suffered a hefty sell-off amid concerns that the health of the insurance sector had been jeopardised by the credit crunch. Aviva, formerly Norwich Union, saw a third of its value wiped out. Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, said house prices fell by 2.3% in February and were almost 18% lower than a year ago, while the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car sales were down 20% on February last year. The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said quantitative easing was a \"leap in the dark\", adding: \"I don't think anyone should be pleased we have reached this point. It is an admission of failure.\" Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said increasing the amount of money flowing into the economy was the \"only clear option\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
