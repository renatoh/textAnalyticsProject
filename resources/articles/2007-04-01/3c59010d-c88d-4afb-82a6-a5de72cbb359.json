The FA confirmed yesterday that the Sele\u00e7a\u00f5 will be Steve McClaren's first opponents at the new stadium and in a reciprocal arrangement England will play a game hosted by the Brazilians at a European stadium. The deal was brokered by the sports agency Kentaro, the firm which arranged England's friendly against Argentina in Geneva in 2005. The agency acts for the Brazilian federation and has already staged two internationals for Brazil at the Emirates Stadium, against Argentina and Portugal, both of which were sell-outs and attracted big TV audiences. The return game offers England the chance to play a friendly against top-class South American opposition without the disruption of a long-haul flight, a factor that also suits Brazil, the majority of whose players are based in Europe. Confirmation of the Wembley game is a fillip to the FA, who will now hope the first two senior games at the ground are a Chelsea-Manchester United FA Cup final and the Brazil match. That should help shift the remaining Club Wembley seats. Ordinary tickets will be harder to come by, with a ballot to be held for those supporters not members of the englandfans official club. Uefa counter violence The Uefa president, Michel Platini, will convene a meeting of law enforcement agencies from across Europe in the autumn to discuss crowd disorder and other criminal threats to football. Uefa believes the English policing model represents the best practice and will invite UK representatives to share their experiences with their continental counterparts. Platini has already held meetings with police representatives of 17 nations and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission. C4 snare big race in web The trend for internet ambushing will continue this week, with Channel 4 showing the entire card from Aintree's three-day Grand National meeting online despite the BBC owning the broadcasting rights. C4 is able to circumvent the BBC deal because of its own arrangement with Racing UK, the subscription channel which owns the rights to Aintree meetings. C4 hopes to repeat the trick for the Oaks and Derby. Bet-fire trailer is back Betfair's mobile \"education unit\", a trailer which shows punters unaccustomed to betting exchanges what they are missing, will make its return to racing at Aintree today nine months after bursting into flames at Uttoxeter. The blaze, caused by an electrical fault, delayed racing by almost two hours. Betfair estimates it will match more than \u00a36m in bets on the Grand National."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
