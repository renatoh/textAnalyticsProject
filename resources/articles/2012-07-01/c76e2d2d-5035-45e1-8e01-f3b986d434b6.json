So, the E and the U at the end there are both heard. And the vowel sounds are pretty much as they are in English, just shorter (a = ah, e = eh (NOT ee), i =ee, o = oh, u = oo). \"The other thing is that the E has an accent on it which doesn't change the sound but makes it the letter that is stressed. So it's BernabEu. To put that in a pronounciation - Bernabayoo is basically right, but as the vowel sounds are a bit shorter, I'd prefer: Berna-bEh-oo (without that oooh being elongated).\" So, er, now you know. EXPLAINING JAN VENNEGOOR OF HESSELINK'S NAME \"What's the story behind Dutch striker Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink's unusually area-specific name?\" asked David Atkinson in 2004. According to our research, the new Celtic striker was thus named because, way back in the 17th century, two farming families in the Enschede area of Holland intermarried. Both the Vennegoor and Hesselink names carried equal social weight, and so - rather than choose between them - they chose to use both. 'Of' in Dutch actually translates to 'or', which would mean that a strict translation of his name would read Jan Vennegoor or Hesselink. GET IN! \"A few years ago in the Premiership, a referee pumped his fist with an exclamation of 'yes!' when a player scored a goal in a certain game,\" said Ian Kerr in 2006. \"The referee later claimed that he was so pumped because he had allowed play to go on instead of blowing for a foul in the build-up, and was chuffed with his own free-flowing refereeing. So who was the ref? What teams were playing, and who scored the goal? And where is our friend the enthusiastic referee now?\" The nugget in question was Mike Reed, who knocked seven bells out of fresh air when Patrik Berger put Liverpool ahead against Leeds during their 3-1 win on 5 February 2000. Reed did indeed claim he was made up with his own performance, having waved play on after Vladimir Smicer was fouled in the build-up, but the FA were not particularly enamoured with his public display of self-loving. \"Having considered the available information, we have issued a reprimand and a warning to Mike Reed,\" warbled a spokesman. \"While we understand the emotions involved, it is essential that match officials do not make gestures which could lead to misinterpretation. The impartiality of our officials must not be open to question. Mr Reed has been warned to keep his emotions under control in future or face further action.\" He did, but not for long: it was Reed's last season as a professional referee. HOW LOW CAN YOU GO? \"Is Juventus's attendance of 237 against Sampdoria in the Coppa Italia this season a record low for any top-flight team in the big European leagues (barring games played behind closed doors, of course)?\" asked Peregrine Roscorla in 2006. We haven't been able to find anything more miserable than that, Peregrine, but were amused to find that Europe's least appealing club competition may well be the InterToto Cup. The 2003 first-round clash between Olympiakos Nicosia and ZTS Dubnica (Slovakia) attracted an impressive 71 punters, while a far more respectable 80 turned up two years later as Olympiakos Nicosia hosted Gloria Bistrita (Romania), again in the first round. On the international front, the record low for Uefa competitions remains the Euro 96 qualifier between Azerbaijan and Poland in Trabzon (Turkey), when precisely 200 hardy souls went out of their way to watch a 0-0 draw. \u2022 Send your questions to knowledge@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
