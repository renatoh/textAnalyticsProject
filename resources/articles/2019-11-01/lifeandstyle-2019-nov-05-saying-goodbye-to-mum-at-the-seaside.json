My mother gave us two good reasons for taking this literally. She insisted that if she was still alive, she wanted to celebrate her 90th birthday with lunch at her favourite Scarborough fish and chip restaurant. Four generations joined her to do just that and after lunch we headed for the Spa on the seafront. Having achieved her final ambition, she went into rapid decline and died six weeks later. On the day she died, my wife, daughter and I decided to go to Whitby by train and bus. Two celebrations courtesy of the Yorkshire coast. Geoff Reid Bradford \u2022 It is good advice to suggest cod liver oil to avoid a vitamin D deficiency (G2, 4 November).

In spite of its rather rustic appearance, it successfully carried its builder and his family to the west. Sebastian Robinson Glasgow \u2022 In Hyde, Cheshire, we also used to call it \u201ccob-coaling\u201d (Letters, 5 November), though we collected wood and not nutty slack. Jane McAdoo London \u2022 In my Lancashire village in the 1940s groups of children went from house to house singing \u201cWe come a-cob-coaling for bonfire day.\u201d It was quite a folk song in its entirety.
