Indigenous dispossession and Australia\u2019s colonial shame was a theme Keating returned to often during the lively 90-minute discussion, saying his greatest \u201cemotional commitment\u201d was the historic Mabo legislation that he ushered in which recognised the land rights of Australia\u2019s indigenous people. \u201cWe beat being marginalised, like South Africa was with apartheid, by the skin of our teeth,\u201d Keating said. Malcolm Turnbull could deliver a republic in his next term in office, Keating said, in a strong push for an Australian republic. \u201cWhat are we going to end up with? Charles and Camilla for God\u2019s sake?\u201d Keating said. \u201cPrince William is the nicest royal to show up for donkey\u2019s years. But he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t need him and his lovely wife as our heads of state. It\u2019s an affront to everything we\u2019ve created here. It\u2019s a spoof of everything we\u2019ve done with ourselves in history to be landing back there waiting for Prince Charles to inherit the throne. It\u2019s deeply sick.\u201d After engineering a strong economy during his time as treasurer, Keating said he was ready to attack the bigger picture when he became PM. \u201cWe had to turn the place over. What I wanted Australia to be was an open, competitive, cosmopolitan country, which was a republic ... had I won in 1996, we would be a republic by now.\u201d Now 71, Keating says he will never write an autobiography because \u201canyone who\u2019s any good never wrote about themselves\u201d \u2013 but he is certainly making sure his legacy stands, book or no book. He is doing this by talking to the ABC veteran at length: first for the four-part TV series Keating \u2013 The Interviews, then for O\u2019Brien\u2019s new book, Keating. To mark the book\u2019s release, Keating agreed to a couple of live events in which the two former sparring partners would adopt a more relaxed tone. Gone was the forensic questioning which marked O\u2019Brien\u2019s interviews with Keating on The 7.30 Report and Lateline in the late 1980s and early 1990s. At times O\u2019Brien would ask a question Keating believed was not in keeping with the collaborative tone of the evening. \u201cYour 7.30 slip is showing Kerry,\u201d Keating said to rapturous applause. It was a softer, more reflective elder statesman that the largely Labor audience got for the $50 ticket price \u2013 and they lapped it up, applauding every time he delivered a sharp line and laughing at all his jokes. The career politician said it was the love of his grandmother and his mother that gave him the confidence and self-assurance he needed to seize power and use that power to change the country. \u201cMy grandmother died when I was 12; I was devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cI could do no wrong with her. I was absolutely ace. And I do think you carry that with you.\u201d In Keating\u2019s assessment, his time at the top was marked by its policy achievements rather than by the \u201ctricky politics\u201d of earlier administrations, but he did concede, with some prodding from O\u2019Brien, that he may have had some tricks. But not many. Still intact was his ability to cut down his opponents, or even his own political colleagues, with a blistering remark. Yes, Gough Whitlam was all about policy too but he fell over too soon, Keating said \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019ve got to stand long enough on your feet [to make a difference]\u201d. Yes, he had a \u201chugely talented cabinet\u201d but he alone was the \u201cguiding light\u201d who gave the government \u201cspiritual nourishment\u201d. Bob Hawke got on with the business of government but it was Keating who made sure we didn\u2019t \u201cdilute\u201d the vision. \u201cPrime ministers are very useful to a treasurer,\u201d Keating said mischievously, and Hawke and I had a great relationship until he \u201cproduced a nasty little book\u201d. \u201cSo I decided to do the TV series with you.\u201d Keating ended his grand performance with a line about his political opponents, in particular former Liberal leader John Hewson, which drew the loudest applause of the evening: \u201cI threw them around like rag dolls. It was such fun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
