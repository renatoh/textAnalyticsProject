The decision to keep the Cup at Santa Anita was made at a meeting of the 14-strong board of the Breeders\u2019 Cup and is believed to have been the outcome of a unanimous vote. As a result, this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup will be the focus of intense scrutiny, as many of the best horses from both the United States and Europe line up for 14 races on dirt and turf worth $30m [\u00a323.7m]. A number of causes have been suggested for the sudden rise in fatal injuries at Santa Anita in recent months, including the possibility that unusually wet weather at the start of the year left the track in an unsafe condition. The fact race-day medications are permitted in the US has also been highlighted, amid claims these can mask underlying injuries which would otherwise cause a horse to be pulled out. There have also been claims trainers are under pressure to run horses and ensure full fields to maximise betting turnover. The Stronach Group, which runs Santa Anita, has introduced measures designed to reduce injuries. It also aims to reduce and ultimately eliminate the use of Lasix, an anti-bleeding medication, on racedays. The California Horse Racing Board has introduced a five-strong panel to assess all horses\u2019 fitness to race before they can run, with a single \u201cno\u201d vote being enough to rule a horse out. It is unclear whether the panel will have jurisdiction over Breeders\u2019 Cup events. It is also uncertain whether Jerry Hollendorfer, one of America\u2019s most successful trainers, will be allowed to have runners at November\u2019s meeting. Hollendorfer was recently banned from Santa Anita after the fourth death of a horse from his barn at the course since December. \u201cForemost among the core values of the Breeders\u2019 Cup are the safety and integrity of the competition and we hold ourselves, our host sites and our competitors, to the highest standards of both, Craig Fravel, the president and CEO of the Breeders\u2019 Cup, said on Thursday. \u201cIt is clear that meaningful and effective reforms and best practices have been implemented in recent months at Santa Anita through the collective efforts of The Stronach Group, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the California Thoroughbred Trainers, and the California Horse Racing Board. \u201cWe fully embrace those reforms and will devote our time and energy in the coming months to further advance those efforts. We look forward to showing the world the best in thoroughbred racing at one of its finest venues.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
