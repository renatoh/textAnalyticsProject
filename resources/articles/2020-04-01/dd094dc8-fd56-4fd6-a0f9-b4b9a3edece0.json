His short statement, issued on Saturday night, paying tribute to NHS staff, followed a nerve-racking few days when he was rushed to hospital, later admitted to intensive care, given oxygen, before being released back on to the ward to begin his slow recovery. In the early days of Johnson\u2019s infection with the coronavirus, when he was self-isolating in his flat above 11 Downing Street, every effort was made to play down the gravity of his condition. This, no doubt, was the way Johnson wanted it. Friends and others who have known him for many years are well aware that he had always \u2013 and certainly in his younger days \u2013 been rather dismissive of the idea of getting ill. The former Tory MP and journalist Paul Goodman, who worked with him at the Daily Telegraph, recalls this tendency: \u201cI remember he always seemed to regard being ill as a form of moral weakness. It baffled him.\u201d So the early messages about Johnson\u2019s solitary confinement were typically defiant. The symptoms, we were told, were mild \u2013 something of an irritant but no more. And they certainly would not prevent the prime minister from continuing to run the country and lead it, Churchill style, out of our grave national crisis and well beyond. Even then, however, there was understandable concern for the PM\u2019s health. Despite all the bravado and Johnson\u2019s \u201ckeep buggering on\u201d spirit, the 55-year-old had been placed on a significantly reduced workload in an attempt to aid his recovery. Incoming phone calls were strictly limited and paperwork drastically reduced. The PM managed to record almost daily videos of himself on his phone \u2013 pale, hair even more ruffled than usual, urging his people on \u2013 but they betrayed a certain desperation. Only his principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and director of communications Lee Cain were in contact with the PM, apart from the daily consultations he held with his doctor. After more than a week in which the mood in the rest of No 10 was quiet and sombre, with many other staff off sick, there had been no improvement in Johnson\u2019s condition. While the health secretary Matt Hancock, who at 41 is 14 years younger than Johnson, was recovering fast, having fallen ill at around the same time, his boss was still not on the mend. By 2 April it had been agreed that the PM\u2019s condition and workload would be reviewed that coming weekend. Johnson chaired last Saturday morning\u2019s coronavirus meetingwith senior ministers, medical advisers and officials and, as ever, the word afterwards was that he had been \u201cin good spirits\u201d. But clearly it was becoming more and more of a struggle. After the meeting the PM\u2019s diary was completely cleared and that evening his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she too was suffering from symptoms and was also going to self-isolate. The worrying news mounted day after day. At just before 8pm on Sunday, on the advice of his doctor, Johnson was driven in a government car a few hundred metres from Downing Street to be admitted to St Thomas\u2019 Hospital. Again, his team tried to play down the significance of the moment, saying his admission was \u201cprecautionary\u201d. But the PM could no longer pretend to be Winston Churchill. He called Dominic Raab, foreign secretary and first secretary of state, and asked him to chair the main government meeting on coronavirus the next morning and stand in for him on other duties. Then last Monday evening his condition worsened on the ward, and he was transferred to intensive care. The Queen was informed and the news was made public. Charles Walker, a Tory MP who knows Johnson well, said that when he received a text on his phone relaying the news, he and his wife \u2013 like much of the country \u2013 found it hard to take. \u201cWe had watched the Queen on Sunday night, one of the anchors in our lives. She took us back to the moment in her reign when she broadcast during the war with her sister. Then to suddenly hear that our prime minister had been taken into intensive care \u2026 in my 52 years I really have to say I think it was the darkest hour. We had lots of friends and family contracting the virus, and had news of so many people dying, then you think, \u2018my God, we could lose him as well\u2019.\u201d That night people across the country, from all walks of life, reported having sleepless nights. Like Johnson or loathe him, the feeling of shock was the same. Those of us who have known and watched this man for decades \u2013 and seen him not only survive but climb the greasy pole despite endless personal and political mishaps and scandals \u2013 also felt the same mix of shock, sympathy and disbelief. How could it be that Johnson of all people was suddenly in danger of losing his life? Goodman recalled absurd images of Johnson suspended over London on a zipwire in 2012 and said that, however divisive he might be, he was \u201ca life force\u201d. \u201cHe is literally larger than life so when you hear he is dangerously ill it feels like a blow to life itself.\u201d Baroness Morgan, a former member of Johnson\u2019s cabinet, said she was bombarded with messages and texts from people who were not necessarily supporters of Johnson or the Tories. \u201cPeople just seemed to need an outlet and, like all of us, were thinking \u2018my God I can\u2019t believe this has happened\u2019.\u201d She struggled to sleep that night, wondering where this would all end. \u201cWhen I woke up \u2013 and I think this was the case with lots of people \u2013 I just thought \u2018oh no, what am I going to read now?\u2019 Thankfully the news wasn\u2019t any worse, but after what had happened you just didn\u2019t know.\u201d Even Johnson\u2019s fiercest critics were swept up by the national mood of sympathy. A former colleague from Johnson\u2019s days as a Brussels journalist said: \u201cI regard Boris \u2013 who was a friend \u2013 as a liar and charlatan for the way he has behaved, including over Brexit. But when I heard he was in intensive care I just felt this extraordinary wave of sympathy for him.\u201d By Thursday there were tentative signs of improvement. Johnson had not had to be put on a ventilator at any stage. He had been stable for two days and was now \u201cimproving\u201d. A member of the No 10 staff reported a change of mood. \u201cThere is this cautious sense that it may be OK now. And people are returning to work. Dominic Raab\u2019s people are around more. There is more activity about the place. Let\u2019s just hope.\u201d By the evening the news came that the prime minister had been moved out of intensive care and back on to the ward. There was relief in all quarters, but also warnings. His biographer Andrew Gimson said some, at least, of Johnson\u2019s views of himself and the vulnerability of others will have to change. \u201cBoris never used to believe in illness. He neither admitted to sickness himself, nor noticed it in others. He believed he was strong enough to keep going regardless of any symptoms from which he might be suffering. His strong inclination was to overwork, not to put his feet up. In the light of his experiences one hopes he will change his outlook.\u201d His father Stanley Johnson also said his son\u2019s cavalier attitude had almost done for him. \u201cTo use that American expression, he almost took one for the team. We have got to make sure we play the game properly now,\u201d he said. While insisting that his son was not \u201cout of the woods\u201d yet, he was adamant that he must not try to play the heroic figure again during recuperation. \u201cHe has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.\u201d Yesterday the PM was reported to be relaxing on the ward by watching the films Withnail and I and Lord of the Rings. The former Tory MP Anna Soubry said she too was delighted to hear Johnson was on the mend. But it was equally important, she said, that he learn from his experiences and become a better and more sensitive leader. \u201cI am so pleased he seems to be on the mend. But all this Churchillian stuff has to stop now. He has to show that he has been humbled by this and realises that this illness does not discriminate between princes and paupers.\u201d She hopes he will change in other ways too, renewing his enthusiasm for immigration, which he voiced often during his time as mayor of London. And although he had expressed his gratitude to the NHS staff who had treated him, she added, \u201cI hope he thinks about the fact that many of the faces of the people he will have seen treating him so brilliantly in intensive care and on the ward, and who helped nurse him, were immigrant and non-white faces \u2013 many. I hope he thinks about that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false}}}
