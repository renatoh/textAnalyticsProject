Here\u2019s a recap of what happened: Senate Republicans, with the help of a single Democrat, have voted to advance Brett Kavanaugh to a final floor vote. With support from Susan Collins and Joe Manchin, the two final key senators considered \u201cundecided\u201d, Kavanaugh is expected to be confirmed by a 51-49 vote. Collins, a Maine Republican, is facing significant backlash, including a major fundraising effort against her and potential high-profile challenges when she is up for re-election. Collins cast doubts on Dr Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s story in a lengthy speech announcing her decision to vote yes, saying, \u201cThe allegations fail to meet the more-likely-than-not standard.\u201d Manchin, a Democrat, was the last undecided senator to announce his decision and immediately faced intense protests. Manchin said he had \u201creservations\u201d, but added, \u201cI have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution.\u201d Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski voted against advancing Kavanaugh to the final vote, saying she believed he was \u201cnot the right man for the court\u201d. Jeff Flake of Arizona, another closely watched Republican, voted to advance Kavanaugh. President Trump criticized protesters, calling them \u201celevator screamers\u201d and alleging, without evidence, that they were funded by professional interest groups. A final floor vote is expected on Saturday. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested at the US Capitol. Here\u2019s some useful historical context on how Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation vote will compare to past supreme court votes: It is on track to be one of the closest supreme court confirmation votes in history: Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, is facing backlash for comments about why the Republicans on the panel are all male: According to the Wall Street Journal, said: It\u2019s a lot of work \u2013 maybe they don\u2019t want to do it. My chief of staff of 33 years tells me we\u2019ve tried to recruit women and we couldn\u2019t get the job done.\u201d He apparently returned later to clarify his remarks, saying, \u201cWe have a hard time getting men on the committee. It\u2019s just a lot of work whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Grassley has also said he is still going to be investigating Dr Ford\u2019s allegations: With Kavanaugh on track to be confirmed, some are asking whether impeachment could follow. The Washington Post published a helpful analysis of this question earlier: In short, the impeachment process is a possibility if the Democrats regain control of the House. Some Democrats and other critics have accused Kavanaugh of repeatedly lying under oath, which could potentially be the basis for impeachment. If the Democrats took control, it\u2019s possible that the House Judiciary Committee would launch an investigation of Kavanaugh and draft articles of impeachment, the Post noted. The likely Democratic chair of this committee has said he would support this effort. Sarah Palin has also hinted that she would consider running against Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, the only Republican to vote against advancing Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Murkowski is up for re-election in 2022. Palin, the former governor of Alaska and a GOP candidate for vice president in 2008, has been advocating for Kavanaugh on social media. Susan Rice, former United Nations ambassador and national security adviser to President Obama, has suggested she may consider running against Susan Collins: The single-word tweet came less than an hour after Collins announced she would be voting for Kavanaugh, effectively securing the confirmation. The family of Rice\u2019s mother is from Maine, and she has apparently spent time there during summers. Rice is not the only one expressing interest in Collins\u2019 seat: A crowdfunding campaign for Susan Collins\u2019 opponent has now raised over $2m. The donations came pouring in as the Republican senator, a key undecided vote, gave a lengthy speech this afternoon announcing her decision to vote for Kavanaugh. It appeared that there has been so much web traffic to the donation site that the page has temporarily crashed. With Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Susan Collins both declaring their intention to vote for Kavanaugh, it appears the judge is on track to have the votes he needs to be confirmed. After a procedural vote advanced the nomination earlier in the day, the final vote is expected on Saturday. The confirmation was already set to be finalized with Collins\u2019 vote, which would likely have put vice president Mike Pence in a position to break a tie. Now, it appears all but certain that Kavanaugh will be confirmed. Another dramatic protest is unfolding around senator Joe Manchin, the Democrat who has announced he is voting to confirm Kavanaugh. People are chanting \u201cLook at us! Look at us!\u201d and \u201cShame!\u201d as he speaks to reporters. Asked about whether he believed the FBI investigation was adequate, he said: There\u2019s always more that could\u2019ve been done ... I looked at what was in front of me, and I had to make a decision.\u201d Sam Levin here, continuing our live coverage of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation fight. Democratic senator Joe Manchin, considered the last \u201cundecided\u201d senator, has just announced that he is voting to confirm Kavanaugh. He said in a statement: I have reservations about this vote given the serious accusations against Judge Kavanaugh and the temperament he displayed in the hearing. However, based on all of the information I have available to me, including the recently completed FBI report, I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him.\u201d The announcement came shortly after Republican senator Susan Collins also said she would be voting to confirm in a lengthy speech. After lengthy remarks in defense of his nomination, Collins confirms she\u2019ll vote along party lines. Collins is 40 minutes into her remarks. She is taking to task whoever leaked Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s letter, but says she does not believe that person is senator Dianne Fienstein, whose office received the letter. Now she is talking about algorithms and how they help people read articles that confirm their biases. \u201cThe allegations fail to meet the more-likely-than-not standard,\u201d Collins says. \u201cI do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent judge Kavanaugh from serving on the supreme court.\u201d Collins says every person who makes a claim of sexual assault deserves to be heard. \u201cThe MeToo movement is real,\u201d she says, with emphasis. She says since the hearing she has listened to many survivors of sexual assault. Collins is addressing Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh. She said the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d and due process weigh on her thinking. \u201cWe must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy,\u201d she says. She says some of the allegations against Kavanaugh \u201cillustrate why the presumption of innocence\u201d is so important, specifically an allegation that Kavanaugh committee gang rape. He denies the allegation. Collins says Ford\u2019s testimony was \u201csincere, painful and compelling.\u201d And she believes Ford is a victim of sexual assault. But Collins has questions about Ford\u2019s story and the witness testimonies. Now onto Roe v Wade - Collins says it is important to keep in place this pivotal 1973 supreme court ruling to legalize abortion. She explains all the reasons she thinks Kavanaugh is not a threat to Roe v Wade - an interesting argument from a Republican. She says Republicans have been saying their supreme court nominee would end Roe v Wade for decades and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Meanwhile ... Collins says she has spoken to Kavanaugh privately for several hours. She also said she has met with thousands of her constituents, who she said spoke extensively about fears Kavanaugh would gut the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. She says she\u2019s not worried about that. She said another concern people have brought her is that Kavanaugh would give protection to a president facing charges because of his previous writings on executive power. Collins hasn\u2019t said how she is voting, but the early guess is she\u2019ll be a yes for Kavanaugh. She has yet to address the sexual assault allegations, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s ending her remarks anytime soon. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, says the confirmation process has become dysfunctional and chaotic instead of the solemn occasion it should be. She accuses special interest groups of spending \u201can unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this confirmation.\u201d She says the supreme court confirmation process has \u201cbeen in steady decline for more than 30 years,\u201d but hopes the Kavanaugh nomination is \u201crock bottom.\u201d Collins sent a press alert confirming she would speak at 3:05pm. It\u2019s 3:08pm ... and she should be speaking momentarily. Protestors, however, are shouting in the galleries. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders spoke to reporters briefly this afternoon, after the cloture vote. Asked if the White House and Senate GOP leaders have the votes to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, she said: \u201cI sure hope so.\u201d \u201cI think that we should,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s done more than any nominee in history in terms of amount of documents he\u2019s turned over, hours of testimony, interviews. \u201cLook, the president supports his nominee and wants to see him get confirmed.\u201d When asked if the White House was worried about Kavanaugh supporters in the Senate changing their minds before the vote, Sanders said: \u201cHonestly, I think a lot of Democrats should change their mind and do the right thing and [confirm] Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d White House officials hope the Senate votes on Saturday, Sanders said. With the vote to confirm Kavanaugh looking so close, one senator\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding has gained unusual prominence. Senator Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, plans to attend his daughter\u2019s wedding in his home state on Saturday \u2013 the expected voting day. The Senate is divided 51-49 Republican to Democrat. If all Democrats vote no (not a certainty) and one Republican defects, there will be a tie decided by vice-president Mike Pence. That slim margin also means there is not room for a Republican senator not to show up \u2013 even if it\u2019s his daughter\u2019s wedding. Another complicating factor? There\u2019s no direct commercial flights out of Montana to DC on Saturday, and with layovers the journey could take more than seven hours \u2013 not an ideal travel time for someone looking to attend a wedding and a historic Senate vote. Daines, however, said Friday afternoon he\u2019d sorted it out. Gianforte is the congressman who assaulted Guardian journalist Ben Jacobs. Hello, we\u2019re back. Protests are raging across Washington DC as activists try to push swing senators their way. Everyone is watching for Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who has promised a speech at 3pm announcing whether or not she will be backing Kavanaugh. In response to Donald Trump\u2019s tweet alleging anti-Kavanaugh protestors were \u201cpaid professionals,\u201d the Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Stein has this observation from the halls of Congress. (FreedomWorks is a national conservative group.) We\u2019re taking a brief break ahead of a 3pm speech by Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine. Collins voted yes for cloture but said she would hold her announcement on whether or not she supports Kavanaugh until making remarks on the Senate floor this afternoon. We\u2019ll be back around 2:15pm ET with the latest heading into the afternoon session. Arizona Senator Jeff Flake just told reporters that barring a big change, he will be a yes vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation tomorrow. Flake and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski have now both confirmed that their cloture votes today \u2013 Flake yes, Murkowski no \u2013 will be their confirmation votes tomorrow. That means Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation will come down to Susan Collins and Joe Manchin, who both voted yes for cloture this morning. Either one voting yes for confirmation will secure Kavanaugh\u2019s place on the court. Collins is expected to announce her decision at 3pm Eastern Time. Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski told reporters moments ago that she did not make up her mind to vote no on cloture for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination until she was literally walking in to the chamber this morning. \u201cI believe Brett Kavanaugh is a good man,\u201d she said. But he\u2019s \u201cnot the right man for the court.\u201d It\u2019s happening: tomorrow the Senate will hold its final confirmation vote for Brett Kavanaugh after voting on Friday to end debate on his supreme court nomination. The Senate voted 51-49 on Friday morning to advance Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to a final floor vote, but signaled their votes were not cast in stone. In tomorrow\u2019s vote, eyes will be on Republicans Jeff Flake, of Arizona; Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska and Susan Collins, of Maine. Flake and Collins voted yes for cloture but Flake has been hesitant to offer strong support for Kavanaugh. Collins said she will announce her position on the final vote this afternoon. Murkowski voted no, a big statement, but she could still ultimately endorse Kavanaugh. On the Democrat side, the key vote will likely come down to Joe Manchin, a conservative up for re-election in West Virginia. Donald Trump said he was \u201cproud\u201d of the Senate for advancing the vote. Hours earlier, he accused protestors of being \u201cpaid professionals,\u201d without evidence. Brett Kavanaugh took the unusual step on Thursday of taking the case for his confirmation to the US supreme court to the pages of the Wall Street Journal, admitting his Senate testimony \u201cmight have been too emotional\u201d and insisting that he would be impartial if confirmed. More than 300 protesters, including the comedian Amy Schumer, were arrested at the US Capitol in Washington as they made a final, desperate appeal to senators. A yes today may be a no tomorrow. Or it might stay a yes. One key senator, Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, declines to reveal his final position on Kavanaugh after voting yes on cloture. He also said he has a statement coming out soon. The vote is over, but Republicans in the Senate still can\u2019t rest easy. Trump has a quick response to the vote. It remains unclear if Donald Trump\u2019s embattled pick for America\u2019s highest court would ultimately have the votes to be confirmed, writes the Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui: A handful of key senators tipped their hand in Friday\u2019s procedural motion but signaled their votes were not cast in stone. Two of the chamber\u2019s closely watched moderate Republicans, Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, voted in favor of advancing Kavanaugh, while Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against the judge. Joe Manchin, a senator up for re-election in conservative West Virginia, was the lone Democrat to break with his party. \u201cThis is one vote that we probably won\u2019t know until the votes are actually cast,\u201d Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill. The uncertainty lingered one day after the FBI completed an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, the results of which fell firmly along party lines. Republicans swiftly declared that the FBI\u2019s report, which was shrouded in secrecy and accessed only by senators and a select group of staffers, absolved Kavanaugh of any wrongdoing. Democrats meanwhile condemned the investigation \u2013 the parameters of which were reportedly set by the White House \u2013 as preordained. The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the cloture motion, which will bring an end to debate on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the supreme court. The final vote on his confirmation could happen as early as tomorrow. Support for cloture is not equivalent to support for Kavanaugh, so it\u2019s not clear whether or not he will make it through. A key senator, Republican Susan Collins of Maine, said she will reveal her plan for the final vote in a speech at 3pm this afternoon. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, votes yes for cloture. The rest of the key swing senators voted: Flake \u2013 Yes Murkowski \u2013 No Collins \u2013 Yes, but is announcing plan for final confirmation vote at 3pm ET. Swing senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, has voted no on cloture. Her vote is being read as a no for Kavanaugh as well, but it is too early to say. Reminder: support for cloture is not equivalent to support for Kavanaugh. A key senator, Susan Collins, a republican from Maine, said she will reveal her plan for the final vote in a speech at 3pm this afternoon after voting yes for cloture. Another potential Republican no vote, Jeff Flake of Arizona, has voted in support of cloture. The procedural vote is under way to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. It requires a simple majority vote. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell echoes Grassley\u2019s comment that challenges to Kavanaugh are the work of \u201cthe resistance.\u201d He says the leak of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s letter accusing Kavanaugh of attempted rape \u201copened the floodgates.\u201d He dismisses complaints that the FBI report released yesterday was limited in scope. Like Grassley, he references \u201cthe mob\u201d for tarnishing the confirmation process. Twist! One of the key senators, Republican Susan Collins, is expected to vote yes on the cloture motion today \u2013 but that does not mean she will vote in support of Kavanaugh. Some insiders suggest support for cloture, a procedural vote that would end debate about Kavanaugh, as equivalent to supporting Kavanaugh in the final Senate vote. But that is a hasty conclusion to draw. It sounds like we\u2019ll learn whether Collins supports Kavanaugh or not on the senate floor at 3pm ET. If cloture passes \u2013 the Republicans can afford only one defection if all Democrats oppose the pick \u2013 then a final vote on the nomination would be held over the weekend, likely on Saturday.

Now Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat ranking member, is voicing her opposition to Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. She begins by reviewing his judicial record, which she says shows he is \u201cpro gun\u201d and is a threat to Roe v Wade, the supreme court\u2019s landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. She said \u201cthese views alone are not sufficient for me to vote against Judge Kavanaugh,\u201d but the events of the last few weeks are why she won\u2019t be supporting him. She is focusing on Kavanaugh\u2019s emotional testimony before the senate judiciary committee, which was partisan in an unprecedented way. Grassley continues, he says he does not believe the accusations made against Kavanaugh. \u201cThe multitude of allegations against him have proven to be false,\u201d Grassley says. He gets heated, saying \u201cthe resistance\u201d has made it to the US capitol and is destroying civility in the US. He equates voting to confirm Kavanaugh as a vote against \u201cmob rule.\u201d The vote this morning is to end debate on Kavanaugh. The Senate\u2019s confirmation vote could happen as early as tomorrow. The senate is now in session. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, is speaking about Kavanaugh\u2019s fitness for the job. Grassley says Kavanaugh had an \u201cimpeccable reputation\u201d before being targeted by the left. \u201cThe conduct of leftwing, dark-money groups in this body has shamed us all,\u201d Grassley says. His remarks are focused on how Democrats do not want Kavanaugh to be confirmed. One of the key senators to watch, Democrat Joe Manchin, has told reporters he is undecided and will stay that way until voting time (which is in about an hour). Manchin is a conservative Democrat up for re-election in November in a state won by Trump in 2016 with a 42-point margin, and will be worried about losing votes if he rejects the president\u2019s nominee. Even if he and other swing senators vote \u201cyes\u201d in today\u2019s cloture vote - a procedural one to end debate on the issue - one or more could conceivably then switch sides for a final vote tomorrow. US president Donald Trump has accused protesters of not being sincere without providing evidence to back that claim. The reference to \u201celevator screamers\u201d is presumably about two women who said they were survivors of sexual assault and confronted Jeff Flake, the critical swing vote on the Senate judiciary committee, on his way to cast his vote last week to advance Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. Protests this morning include a group of people drinking beer outside senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s house. They are chanting \u201cchug, chug, chug.\u201d Last week, Kavanaugh mentioned beer repeatedly in his testimony before the US senate judiciary committee. In another incident sure to symbolise the cultural gulf between the mostly elderly, male Republican senators pushing Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination and the young, female protesters appalled by it, Orrin Hatch of Utah was recorded telling a group of mostly female demonstrators to \u201cgrow up\u201d when they confronted him at the Senate. \u201cDon\u2019t you wave your hand at me,\u201d one of the protesters told the senator. Hatch replied: \u201cWhen you grow up, I\u2019ll be glad to.\u201d Audibly furious, one of the demonstrators says: \u201cHow dare you talk to women that way?\u201d Yesterday more than 300 protesters \u2013 including comedian Amy Schumer and model Emily Ratajkowski \u2013 were arrested at the US Capitol after demonstrating against Kavanaugh. \u201cLook at the polls over the last three or four days,\u201d Donald Trump told a rally in Minnesota, \u201cand it shows [Democrats\u2019] rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\u201d The president was referring to polling that shows some improvement for Republicans heading into November\u2019s midterm elections. Liberals had hoped the controversy surrounding Kavanaugh would increase Democratic enthusiasm, help the party win the House, and perhaps even allow them to sneak a one-seat majority in the Senate. In fact, it seems to be boosting Republicans as much as Democrats, according to an NPR/PBS/Marist poll. NPR reports: In July, there was a 10-point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans saying the November elections were \u201cvery important.\u201d Now, that is down to 2 points, a statistical tie. Democrats\u2019 advantage on which party\u2019s candidate they are more likely to support has also been cut in half since last month. Democrats still retain a 6-point edge on that question, but it was 12 points after a Marist poll conducted in mid-September \u2026 With Democrats already fired up for this election, the Kavanaugh confirmation fight has apparently had the effect of rousing a dormant GOP base. One concrete example seems to be the Senate race in North Dakota, where Republican Kevin Cramer now seems to be about 9 points ahead of incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp. To Cramer\u2019s evident delight, Heitkamp has said she will vote against Kavanaugh. \u201c[The Kavanaugh hearings] proved to be perhaps the greatest political gift I\u2019ve received in some time,\u201d her opponent has said. It\u2019s possible, though, that if Kavanaugh is confirmed tomorrow the heat will go out of that battle for GOP voters and that surge may fade. But it is unlikely to fade for Democrats. The Washington Post suggests that if senator Steve Daines heads to Montana to attend his daughter\u2019s wedding tomorrow (see earlier), Republicans could wait till the early hours of Sunday so he can still cast his vote. Daines\u2019s vote will not be needed Saturday unless one Republican defects and Democrats stay unified against Kavanaugh. In that case, a Saturday evening session could be held open for hours into Sunday so Daines, who supports Kavanaugh, could return to Washington after the wedding and cast his vote. If two Republicans vote against Kavanaugh today, and all Democrats also reject him, his nomination is over. Four senators remain undecided. They are: Jeff Flake (Rep, Arizona) The frequent Trump critic dismayed liberals when he voted in favour of Kavanaugh in last week\u2019s committee vote. But he then stunned Washington by insisting the FBI reopen its background check into the nominee. But Flake has said the background check contained \u201cno additional corroborating information\u201d about the claims against Kavanaugh, and it would be a surprise now if he voted against the judge. Susan Collins (Rep, Maine) One of the most liberal Republican senators, Collins called the FBI\u2019s work \u201ca very thorough investigation\u201d. Lisa Murkowski (Rep, Alaska) Another senator on the left of the Republican party, Murkowski said on Thursday she was \u201cstill reviewing\u201d which way to vote. Joe Manchin (Dem, West Virginia) The conservative Democrat remains the only senator in his party undecided about Kavanaugh. He is up for re-election in November in a state won by Trump in 2016 with a 42-point margin, and will be worried about losing votes if he rejects the president\u2019s nominee. On the other hand, he has around a 10-point lead in the polls, so he may decide he can weather any backlash. Manchin was confronted by a protester on Thursday, who asked him: \u201cWhy are you going to vote yes on this?\u201d \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m going to?\u201d the senator replied. Asked directly how he was going to vote, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you now.\u201d Even if all these senators vote \u201cyes\u201d in today\u2019s cloture vote - a procedural one to end debate on the issue - one or more could conceivably then switch sides for a final vote tomorrow. Confirming Kavanaugh will be that bit harder for the Republicans if Senator Steve Daines of Montana goes ahead with his vow to attend his daughter\u2019s wedding in his home state on Saturday, according to the Associated Press. If Daines walks his daughter down the aisle instead of voting in the expected final vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination tomorrow, only one Republican \u201cno\u201d vote would sink the nominee \u2013 provided, that is, all Democrats vote against him too. The Senate is divided 51-49 Republican to Democrat. In the event of a tie, vice-president Mike Pence has the casting vote. Brett Kavanaugh took the unusual step on Thursday of taking the case for his confirmation to the US supreme court to the pages of the Wall Street Journal, admitting his Senate testimony \u201cmight have been too emotional\u201d and insisting that he would be impartial if confirmed. Kavanaugh\u2019s aggressive demeanor and highly partisan statements - at one point he claimed the allegations against him were \u201crevenge on behalf of the Clintons\u201d \u2013 seemed designed to win over an audience of one: Donald Trump. In that respect he was successful. The US president, who had been publicly wavering in his support for his nominee, came out strongly for Kavanaugh following his testimony, tweeting that \u201cJudge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him. His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting.\u201d But Kavanaugh\u2019s WSJ piece indicates that what went down well in the White House may not have been as welcome to some of the senators whose support he needs to be confirmed \u2013 most notably Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and conservative Democrat Joe Manchin. He wrote: I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband and dad. I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all my daughters. Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good. His comments came too late for one peer, former supreme court justice John Paul Stevens, who said on Thursday that Kavanaugh\u2019s performance before the Senate judiciary committee had changed his mind about his fitness to serve on the highest court in the land. \u201cThey suggest that he has demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court that he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities,\u201d Stevens said, comparing Kavanaugh unfavourably with Clarence Thomas, who faced sexual harassment accusations during his successful confirmation process in 1991. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that Clarence did in the hearings that disqualified him from sitting in cases after he came on the court,\u201d Stevens said. Good morning and welcome The US Senate is due to take a crucial vote on Friday on whether to advance Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nominate to the supreme court, with key senators still seemingly undecided on whether to vote to confirm him. If 51 senators vote in favor of passing today\u2019s \u201ccloture vote\u201d, the debate on his nomination must come to an end and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell can move to a final ballot for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. That final vote could then come as early as Saturday. The cloture vote comes one day after senators reviewed a supplemental FBI investigation into allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted women three decades ago. Kavanaugh denies the allegations. The limited FBI investigation was triggered after Christine Blasey Ford testified at a Senate hearing last week that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when they were teenagers in high school. The cloture vote will give an insight into how ready swing senators \u2013 such as Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine and Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia \u2013 are to vote on Kavanaugh. Heading into the vote, two key Republicans, including Collins, expressed satisfaction with the findings in the report, indicating Kavanaugh could be confirmed by the senate.
