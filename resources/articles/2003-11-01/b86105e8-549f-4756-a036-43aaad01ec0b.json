Blatter, on a visit to London, said the FA's pedestrian procedures were not in football's best interests and Ferdinand's case should have been dealt with weeks ago. He also said Soho Square might face sanctions, including suspension from international football, if the FA does not implement regulations under which sent-off players are automatically suspended for the next game. \"I'm not happy with the speed or rather the non-speed of dealing with the [Ferdinand] case,\" he said. \"Such a case should be dealt with immediately.\" He raised the matter with the FA chairman Geoff Thompson yesterday and made it clear Fifa will watch the case closely and intervene if it feels the punishment is too lenient. \"If I was meeting the head of the FA's disciplinary committee today I would be telling him they should use the case to send a very strong warning to other players. \"It's clear in our doping regulations that someone refusing or not undergoing a doping test is considered as serious a case as if it was a positive test. Before taking any sanction against the England player we want to know how their national association will deal with it.\" Blatter also criticised the England players for threatening to strike after Ferdinand was excluded from the party that travelled to Turkey last month. He described their action as \"not acceptable\". \"When the national team is called by the coach and a player is not in the squad, the association cannot accept any pressure from players to try and make sure the one who is not in the team is selected. It is not permitted; it is not acceptable for any reason.\" On the subject of red cards Blatter criticised the FA for not introducing the regulations immediately. The FA has said they will come into force at the start of next season. Blatter said he would be asking Fifa's general secretary to contact Soho Square to implement the change as soon as possible. \"They should be implementing the regulations now and if they do not it will be brought to the attention of our discipline committee. That has the power to do everything, from a warning to a suspension from all international activities.\" Blatter also defended Fifa's record on doping and rejected criticism from the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency Dick Pound, who told yesterday's Guardian: \"There's no question that football thinks of itself as a special case. The penny has not dropped; they think Wada is this little organisation put together by the IOC.\" The Fifa president said it would sign up to the Wada code, which governs all Olympic sports, and he rejected the criticism. \"He does not understand that Wada is a service organisation. Wada is not a sports-politics organisation, it is a service to sport. I asked Jacques Rogge [president of the IOC] and he said Wada is a service; sport has to be in charge of sport, not Wada. \"We are fighting against doping and have the most sophisticated regulations to fight it.\" Blatter added that Fifa would sign up to the code so long as the principle of individual responsibility was accepted. Unlike many sports, where fixed penalties are brought, Fifa insists each case must be judged on its merits. \"If individual case management is agreed then we will accept it. I have spoken to Mr Pound and he said it would be in the code. We will never abandon our sport's right to run itself.\" Blatter said that since 1994 Fifa had carried out 2,360 drug tests and in that time there had been only one positive, Diego Maradona's at USA 94."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
