But it\u2019s wearing thin", "bodyText": "In his account of his first successful general election campaign in 2001, Boris Johnson confesses to a dread of the candidate\u2019s random contact with the public: \u201cWalkabouts generally provoke psychic stress. You can\u2019t just walk up and down, beaming. People will try to ignore you. It is necessary to accost them whether they seem interested or not.\u201d It is surely also a sign of stress that Johnson\u2019s handlers concocted a now infamous video that acts out his fantasy version of a walkabout instead, with an unseen young man asking him really hard questions like: \u201cHey, Boris. You awright?\u201d; \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind today?\u201d; \u201cHow do you typically start your day?\u201d and \u201cMarmite, yes or no?\u201d, all filmed on the mean streets of Conservative party election HQ. The video served mainly to remind us that Johnson\u2019s great appeal to the Tory party members who voted for him \u2013 that he is brilliant with ordinary people out on the campaign trail \u2013 is a dubious proposition. In his limited amount of \u201crandom contact with the public\u201d, as in the televised debates in which his bumptiousness is so at odds with the intimacy of the medium, Johnson seems barely to make real contact at all. He is like one of those unfortunates employed in Disneyland to walk around in a Mickey Mouse suit and greet customers with exaggerated gestures. Except that he is dressed not as Mickey but as another cartoon character \u2013 Boris. There is now a fundamental problem with the public persona Johnson has constructed so successfully. The persona is not just \u201cBoris\u201d but also, in a more complex formulation, \u201cBoris being Boris\u201d. \u201cBoris\u201d is the character in a long-running comic saga, written, performed and partly produced by Johnson himself. He is an idiot savant, a hapless bumbler who nonetheless tells it as it is. \u201cBoris being Boris\u201d, on the other hand, is the excuse for racism, for homophobia, for constant lies. It has been, for Johnson, a perfect coupling: whenever Boris is a bad boy, whenever he is peddling falsehoods and nastiness, it is just that \u201cBoris being Boris\u201d sometimes involves going too far. But these twin personae begin to come apart when the clown becomes the ringmaster. It is one thing to be attracted to the Boris persona, quite another to place your trust in \u201cBoris being Boris\u201d. The election campaign has revealed an underlying tension between what Johnson is and what he does. The first part is an asset; the second an anxiety. The one thing Johnson has going for him is the power of celebrity. He has been famous for 20 years now. When he ran for parliament in 2001, he was \u201cstunned\u201d to be approached by a uniformed policeman who diffidently asked him for his autograph. Fame is an effective substitute for intimacy. As he put it himself at the time: \u201cIt makes people sure they know you, and their reactions to you become personal and rather deluded.\u201d Fame itself does the personal stuff that Johnson cannot do. As we\u2019ve seen time after time in this campaign, he is no good at faking intimacy, even in highly controlled settings and even with easy targets, like the little kids whose schools he invades. He is no good at it because he is really not interested in anyone except himself. Johnson\u2019s staged campaign stops say \u201cLook, here I am!\u201d, never \u201cHere you and I are together.\u201d Yet perhaps he doesn\u2019t need to be good at it. Perhaps it is a category error on the part of his handlers even to try to make Johnson look as if he is out connecting with people. For with fame it works the other way around \u2013 if you\u2019re a celebrity, people already feel \u201csure they know you\u201d. Johnson is \u201cpersonal\u201d for voters in the way a long-running character from EastEnders or the Archers might be. The delusion of intimacy is baked in to the whole \u201cBoris\u201d act. Conversely, the more Johnson tries to act like a real person, the more he raises uncomfortable questions. What\u2019s he \u201creally\u201d like? Is he really kind to children and animals? Does he actually give a toss about the rest of us? He would surely be better off surfing his celebrity (as Donald Trump did in his campaign rallies) rather than trying and failing to look like a normal human being. But that still leaves the problem of \u201cBoris being Boris\u201d. Johnson in his 2001 campaign diary has that rarest of things: a moment of shame. He makes a facetious speech about mad cow disease and upsets beef farmers in his constituency. A whole new planet swims into his ken \u2013 the idea of consequences for other people: \u201cI hated myself in that instance for not having the imagination to see that people\u2019s livelihoods were at stake.\u201d The instant obviously passed quickly. There is little evidence he has ever felt this justified self-hatred since. \u201cBoris being Boris\u201d meant never having to feel ashamed again. Yet the very success of this shtick has stretched its astonishing elasticity of evasion to breaking point. If a man does not have the imagination to see that people\u2019s livelihoods are at stake in everything he says and does, should he be running the country? A smarter opposition might be able to make that a central question of the election. If it can\u2019t do so, the man in the Boris suit will keep waving at the customers in his very own theme park. \u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times and author of Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
