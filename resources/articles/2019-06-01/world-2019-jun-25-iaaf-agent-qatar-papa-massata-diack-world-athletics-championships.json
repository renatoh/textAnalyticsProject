French investigators have spent three years scrutinising two payments of $3.5m made in October and November 2011, a month before a vote by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to decide the host of the 2017 world championships. French investigators suspect the payments may have been a bribe to win votes for Qatar for the event, which was eventually won by London. Emails seen by the Guardian and the French website Mediapart, which are not in the French police file, suggest that the disgraced IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack discussed a transfer of money in emails to an account run by Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani, just before the $3.5m payments were made. Al-Thani is a member of the royal family and chief of staff to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was then the crown prince and heir to the throne and became the emir of Qatar in 2013. Massata Diack, who is wanted by Interpol on corruption charges, begins one email to \u201cSheikh Khalid\u201d by telling him: \u201cThanks again for your hospitality and diligence during my stay in Doha,\u201d before providing his IAAF letter of affirmation that \u201cQSI or Oryx QSI\u201d is asking. \u201cI do not owe it to them but to Your HH and yourself as you only know the role I play in this matter,\u201d he adds. HH appears to refer to Tamim Al Thani, who was known as HH Heir Apparent when the letter was written in 2011. The Guardian, which published part of this letter in 2014, has seen evidence that points to \u201cSheikh Khalid\u201d being the chief of staff to the then crown prince, based on an analysis with Mediapart of dozens of other emails sent to the same Hotmail account, some of which use Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani\u2019s full name in Arabic. In the email Massata Diack says: \u201cYou will find attached the bank details for the transfer of $4.5 million which must be done as agreed.\u201d In red ink he then adds: \u201cThe balance of 440,000 must remain in Doha in cash, I will pick it up the next time I come.\u201d Papa Massata Diack specifies that the payment must be made \u201curgently today so that I can finalize things with the president\u201d and show him \u201cthe signed contract and the bank confirmation\u201d. The \u201cpresident\u201d in question appears to be his father Lamine, who was at the time the IAAF president. Papa Massata Diack and Lamine Diack were this week ordered to stand trial on charges of corruption and money laundering by French authorities. They are accused of being part of a conspiracy to bury positive drug tests by Russian athletes in return for money. They all deny the charges. As for the contract, it is believed to be between Massata Diack\u2019s company Pamodzi and Oryx QSI, the company headed by a brother of Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of Paris Saint-Germain football club and BeIN Sports. Seven days later, Oryx QSI made a $3m transfer to Pamodzi. A second one of $500,000 followed on 7 November 2011. Neither Al-Thani or Al Thani responded to the request for comment from the Guardian and Mediapart. Lamine Diack\u2019s lawyer also said he did not want to answer any questions before his case was heard. Massata Diack also refused to respond directly when quizzed over the payment. However after confirming the weather was pleasant in Senegal he added: \u201cIt is better to see you and the French judges your ultimate bosses \u2013 in courts \u2013 to get to the bottom of it!!! The investigation is over and if you are sure of your proofs, just present them there.\u201d This latest development, coming after the former Uefa president Michel Platini was arrested as part of a police corruption probe into the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, will increase the scrutiny on how the country has tried to acquire major sporting events. Al-Khelaifi and his right-hand man Yousef al-Obaidly, the chief executive of BeIN Sports, two of the most senior figures in sport, are facing \u201cactive corruption\u201d charges related to the $3.5m payment. They have been declared \u201cmise en examen\u201d, which they are now suspects in the case rather than a witness. Al-Khelaifi denies all allegations. Al-Obaidly also denies any suggestion of corruption. His representatives insist that the $3.5m wire transfers were a \u201cnon-refundable deposit\u201d by a private company Oryx QSI to Pamodzi Sports Marketing, owned by the IAAF\u2019s appointed agent, Massata Diack, and not to Massata Diack directly. They say this was part of a wider $32.6m bid for athletics TV rights that was dependent on Qatar winning the rights to hold the 2017 world championships. Nasser Al-Khelaifi was also recently asked in court about his connection to the bids for the 2017 world athletics championships and the 2020 Olympics. \u201cI did not deal at all with the negotiations for the World Championships in Athletics or for the Olympic Games,\u201d he told the investigating judge, Renaud van Ruymbeke, in a transcript seen by the Guardian. \u201cFor these events, there is an organising committee in which I am not a stakeholder.\u201d However several documents sent from the Hotmail address used by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as part of a previously unreported five-man \u201cbrain trust\u201d [sic] tasked with helping the then crown prince, \u201cbrain storm strategies and coordinate efforts\u201d to win the 2017 championships and the 2020 Olympics. Other emails suggest Al-Khelaifi\u2019s willingness to use his role as boss of Al Jazeera Sports \u2013 which later changed its name to BeIN Sports \u2013 to help Qatar win the 2017 World Athletics Championships. A confidential letter sent on 26 June 2011 to him by Saoud al-Thani \u2013 the general secretary of the Qatari Olympic Committee and chairman of the 2017 World Championships bidding committee \u2013 asks him to \u201csupport the event\u201d by buying the TV rights for the 2017 world athletics championships, as well as the rights of the other IAAF competitions for 2014-2019. A week later, Al-Khelaifi responds that he accepts all the requests, adding that Al Jazeera Sports \u201cis very pleased to be part of the Team of the Doha 2017 IAAF World Championship Bid Committee and working closely toward the success of this event in Qatar\u201d. Al-Khelaifi did not respond to questions sent by the Guardian and Mediapart. His lawyer added: \u201cMr Al Khelaifi only answers to the judges. He has nothing to declare to you and regrets the violation [of the confidentiality] of the probe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
