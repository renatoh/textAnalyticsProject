But she is also a considerable artist in her own right. Since she won the Bolzano piano competition in 1987 and settled in Germany, her visits to the UK have been rare events, and her solo recitals here even rarer. This appearance at the Wigmore Hall, a gala for the Keyboard Charitable Trust, showed us what we have been missing. She was born and trained in Moscow, and everything about her playing shows how she is an heir to the great Russian pianistic tradition. She has an iron-clad technique, and puts her immense power at the service of a wonderfully natural musicality; there are no frills to her playing, with nothing done for show, yet the impression it leaves is indelible. Some aspects of her performances might seem mannered. Brahms's Intermezzi Op 117 were a bit too affectionately expressive, so that the clean outlines of these exquisite miniatures were smudged. But, as she showed later on, Zilberstein is equally capable of floating a melody with crystalline clarity and no hint of self-indulgence. Intimate late Brahms was followed by barnstorming early Brahms in the shape of the two books of Paganini Variations, each variation characterised with boldness and rhythmic vigour. The second half was devoted to Rachmaninov's set of Preludes Op 32, in which Zilberstein conjured up a tremendous sense of power and tonal richness, with no hint of stridency. This was great piano playing, using all the instrument's resources to illuminate music she understands instinctively and which matches her style perfectly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
