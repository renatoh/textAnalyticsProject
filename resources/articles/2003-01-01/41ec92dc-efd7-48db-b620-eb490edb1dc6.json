For the last three months of last year, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by just 0.4% compared with the previous three months, taking the annual growth rate to 1.7%, the office for national statistics (ONS) said. Despite the weak figures, they still compare favourably with the rest of Europe - particularly Germany, which grew only 0.2% last year - Japan and the US. The consensus for this year's growth is still a respectable 2.3%. Analysts said the key question for 2003 remains the same as for 2002: which part of the economy will give way first, manufacturing or consumer spending. \"The news since the fourth quarter is that the manufacturing sector remains stagnant while consumer spending remains robust despite the seasonal distortions to the retail sales data,\" said John Butler, an economist with HSBC. \"The rebalancing of growth to one speed is unlikely to happen any time soon. Overall these counterforces imply rates will remain on hold for some time yet.\" The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4% for the last 14 months. Whatever concern the Bank's monetary policy committee may have for the dire state of manufacturing is offset by the boom in house prices and strong consumer spending. The Bank believes that both these sectors will cool off this year, but as long as they remain buoyant, the Bank is reluctant to lower the cost of borrowing. The Bank has also played down fears of a rapid slowdown in consumer demand by arguing that low unemployment will prevent a collapse in confidence. Retail sales figures released yesterday helped dispel fears of a slump in consumer demand. ONS figures showed a 1.1% jump in the volume of retail sales in December, despite widespread fears at the end of last year and the start of 2003 that consumers were about to throw in the towel. Last month's increase was the strongest performance by the retail sector since April, although the ONS warned that the unexpectedly vibrant figures may have been boosted by the period covered - the five weeks up to January 4, which include more post-Christmas spending than usual. But the fall in share prices to their lowest level for seven years will be a cause for concern for the Bank. Investors have taken fright at the growing likelihood of a US-led war against Iraq, and the pressure on financial markets and confidence may test the Bank's faith in Britain's consumers. In today's figures, the service sector once again provided the engine for growth, rising 0.6% on the previous quarter. Within services, distribution, hotels and catering expanded by 0.8% on the previous three months and 3.8% on a yearly comparison. However, the ONS indicated that growth within services was recorded in all the sub-sectors, including business and financial services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
