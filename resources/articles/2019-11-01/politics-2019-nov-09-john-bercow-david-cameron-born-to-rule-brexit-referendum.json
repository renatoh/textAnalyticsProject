In an exclusive interview with the Observer that will be published on Sunday morning, Bercow also suggests Cameron called the 2016 Brexit referendum for selfish political reasons, rather than because there was a strong clamour for a public vote on leaving the EU from the British people. Asked about his relationships with Eton-educated Cameron and Boris Johnson, Bercow, who attended a comprehensive school in north London, says that he gets on well with the current prime minister, but is less keen on Johnson\u2019s predecessor but one. Bercow says that Cameron \u201ccould be very impressive\u201d on big occasions but adds: \u201cDavid is relentlessly tactical rather than strategic. Let\u2019s face it, he chose to call the referendum. Was there a clamour for it? There was not. There was chuntering in his own party, but the public wasn\u2019t demanding one. He just thought it would work for him. \u201cHe has the most enormous, probably public-school-instilled, self-confidence. He thinks people like him are born to rule, that the natural order is that people like him run things, and that he is in a superior position.\u201d Bercow, formerly the Conservative MP for Buckingham, stood down after 10 years as Speaker at the end of last month. He will be succeeded by Labour\u2019s Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who won the election to replace him last week. Asked how he was intending to vote at the 12 December general election, Bercow refused to say, suggesting he may not choose the Tories. \u201cYou can ask me, but I\u2019m not going to tell you,\u201d he says. Bercow\u2019s tenure as Speaker was frequently controversial: many Conservative MPs and ministers believed that he was biased against the Tory side and became increasingly and transparently supportive of MPs who backed remaining in the European Union. On Brexit, Bercow says the decision to leave the EU is the biggest foreign policy mistake by a British government in the postwar period. He also criticises Brexiters for campaigning to leave the EU before they had devised a detailed plan about how a UK withdrawal could be achieved, and would work. This lack of forethought by Brexiters meant the last three years of his time as Speaker were dominated by rows in parliament between Remainers and Leavers, leading in the end to total deadlock. \u201cI had assumed that the architects of, and proselytisers for, Brexit, would have a clear idea of what they wanted. I was surprised there wasn\u2019t greater clarity,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
