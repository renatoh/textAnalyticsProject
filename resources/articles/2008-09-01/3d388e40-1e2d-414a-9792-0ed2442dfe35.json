You start reading Alan Mallinson, that's what. His series of 10 novels about Captain Matthew Hervey's career as a cavalry officer in the Light Dragoons begins more or less where Sharpe left off, under Wellington at Waterloo. Mallinson, a retired brigadier, took up writing when he left his own cavalry regiment, the Royal Hussars, to become British military attach\u00e9 in Rome. As a romantic lead, Hervey isn't a patch on Sharpe, with that scar that gives his outrageously handsome features a mocking smile, but he's every bit as brave. Ideally you should start at the beginning. I chose this, his fifth, for personal reasons. It's set in 1823, when the British army was attacking Rangoon en route to Ava, the old royal capital. My Burmese great-grandmother was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Supayalat, consort to the last Burmese King. Outside Cinemascope, this is as near as you'll get to the raw excitement of a fullscale cavalry charge: \"'Left wheel into line,' he called, checking the pace to a trot to allow them the manoeuvre time. Trumpeter Storrs blew the call perfectly, just the four notes and a simple fifth interval. Easy enough with a bugle even at a bounce. 'Draw swords!' Out rasped 200 blades ... this was the best time, a troop in hand, every man intent on his next word of command ... 'CHA ... A ... RGE!' Four hundred cavalry at the gallop. Lances couched but swords held high ...\" Wonderful stuff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
