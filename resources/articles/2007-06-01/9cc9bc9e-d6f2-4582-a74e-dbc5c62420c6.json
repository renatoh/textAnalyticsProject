The EC plans to extend the current laws under the European Timeshare Directive by 2010, to cover a new breed of 'long-term holiday products', schemes which charge holidaymakers substantial fees - \u00a32,000 or more - to gain access to cheap deals on flights and accommodation. Thousands of Britons are scammed each year by the rogue companies that dominate the market. Often the deals never materialise, and holidaymakers are unable to secure a refund. The EC says there is far more risk with these new products than with traditional property timeshares, and that of the 341 complaints made to the UK's European Consumer Centre about such schemes in 2006, 12 related to timeshare but 269 related to discount holiday clubs. 'Many new products have come on to the market that are not covered by existing laws, and consumers are being denied their rights, in terms of cooling-off periods, deposits and consumer information,' said Reijo Kemppinen, head of the EC's London Office. 'The new rules will offer greater protection to UK consumers in today's marketplace.' The new proposals would extend the directive to cover contracts of less than three years, timeshare of cruise ships and caravans, the resale and exchange of timeshares and long-term holiday products. It would also lengthen, from 10 to 14 days, the cooling-off period consumers are entitled to when they sign up to such deals. Peter van der Mark, secretary-general of the Organisation for Timeshare in Europe, was disappointed by the proposals, saying the old legislation had been ineffectually 'patched up' to cover the long-term holiday clubs which have 'nothing to do with property timeshare'. They should be regulated separately, or under broad laws concerning aggressive sales techniques, he said. 'Fraudulent companies will alter the way they operate to escape the regulations, as they have done in the past,' he explained. 'Timeshare is already well regulated and we have just 250 complaints a year across the whole EU. With more than 7 million people taking a timeshare holiday each year, that's very few.' The new rules unduly target timeshare and would damage legitimate businesses, he claimed, by making it harder for them to form contracts with consumers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
