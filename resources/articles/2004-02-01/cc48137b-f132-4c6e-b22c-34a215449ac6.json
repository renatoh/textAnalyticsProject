Sitting up in bed, Mary was on early weather detail. Although huge windows flooded our seafront room with light at 8am, the sky outside was flinty, the sea the colour of charcoal. In the foreground, dogs and their well-wrapped walkers were buffeted along clifftops by the wind, while halfway along the three-mile sweep of Woolacombe beach, the figures who had caught my best friend's attention charged into the surf. Instantaneous hypothermia was our chief concern when we signed up for Surfed Out's Big Wave Clinic at Little Beach Hotel, the first package in the UK to exploit the bigger breakers that westerly Atlantic winds drive into the deserted beaches of north Devon in the months that are traditionally off-season. But straight after an energy-packed, healthy breakfast, we were introduced to our new best friends - the steamers, the latest in thick but flexible winter wetsuits that now make surfing here viable well into February. Assigned surfboards, our group of 16 padded barefoot across the Esplanade and down the grassy slopes to the sand. At water level, Woolacombe's rugged crescent recalled epic slices of coastline from California or northern New South Wales. Its broad, practically empty beach offered an experience a world away from my previous dabblings at various Cornwall hotspots, dodging armies of bodyboarding have-a-go grannies and the sharp, eye-level fibreglass points of local boy racers all competing for a 30-yard wave. We headed for a spot sheltered by towering, weather-worn rock formations, and hunkered down on the sand for our lesson. Currently Europe's fastest growing sport, surfing has an estimated 250,000 regular UK devotees, whose female portion has swelled from 20 to 60 per cent in 10 years. Silver surfers are another boom area, with record figures for beginners in their 30s and 40s. Our crew bore out the statistics pretty much exactly, and we fell into two groups: absolute beginners, and recent rookies like myself with a bit of experience. Very experienced surfers can take advantage of the instructors' knowledge of surfing more extreme conditions - a Wave Finding service across the region is also available for those determined to track the biggest breakers which in winter can tip 20 feet - but for us, chatty patter briskly demystified the basic boardriding process, before, still beached, we sprang into surfing stance. Cold rain started to fall, but as we strode into the sea, the suits showed just what they could do. Unnervingly draughty around the edges on the wet sand, immersion and exertion turned them toasty, and buzzing simply from playing out in such harsh conditions, we splashed and flailed the whole day away like sea lions on speed. Even though progress can be slow - good waves can't be hurried, and timing your jump is a hard-won knack - negotiating a totally new set of physical laws, dressed ever so slightly like James Bond, is its own rush. Wind and tide conspired to deliver perfect waves all afternoon - five footers, in tidy little groups of three which allowed us to swim back out without fighting a wall of water every 10 seconds, and which, once we started to find our feet, let us ride them a good 15-20 yards into shore, while our mentors roared encouragement. In the end, it was blissed-out exhaustion that dragged us, glowing from the full-body workout surfing unquestionably is, out of the water and, our limbs suddenly doubling in weight, the annihilating 400 yards back to the hotel. There, the same friendly faces who'd cheered us on all afternoon pulled us pints, answered questions, and tossed around more gener ous encouragement. These guys could not be further from the cliquey surfer stereotype, all impossible talent, impenetrable jargon, sun-bleached tresses and screw-you attitude that has discouraged many from checking the sport out. The Little Beach Hotel itself is a departure. The latest venture in the Surfed Out mini-empire of schools, shops and services set up six years ago with a \u00a35,000 Prince's Trust grant by local lad Justin Hillyer, this large, traditional British seaside B&amp;B, built into the cliffs, has been given a pared-back, cheap chic makeover, all white walls, neutral fabrics, stripped pine floors and with a beanbag-strewn chill-out area. Offering a menu of cheap comfort food at flexible, surf-friendly hours, hire and repair services plus a few imaginative indulgences - the in-house sports masseur also offers Ayurvedic treatments and Reiki - it represents a canny upgrade on the surfer hostel and an affordable treat for landlocked weekenders. Thoroughly modern designer dining also hit Woolacombe this year, and bar/restaurant Westbeach, which nestles slightly surreally beneath the gigantic, egg-yolk yellow pile of The Golden Hind pub, plans to service both locals and the urban outrider brigade through the winter. With an elegantly funky interior by designer/co-owner Paul Jackson, a menu prepared by Andy Bird, who features in Rick Stein's Seafood Lover's Guide, and, in partnership with Little Beach, five brand new 'surf studio' flats for week-long lets, Westbeach also lays on DJ sets on Fridays and Saturdays (Thursdays through Sundays in summer). Not that the staff at the Little Beach were slouches on our big night, putting on a party that had us rocking till the early hours. Even so, greeted early next morning by the same grey light and the same intrepid figures in the distance, our lives, it was clear, were changed. 'Damn! They started without us!' Factfile Surfed Out's Little Beach Hotel (01271 870398) offers two-and three-day all-inclusive packages with breakfast and lunch but excluding dinner (they claim a 97 per cent success rate in getting novices standing and riding a wave) priced at \u00a3139 and \u00a3199 respectively. From April, prices rise to \u00a3170 for two days (\u00a3200 weekends) and \u00a3260 for three days (\u00a3290 weekends); both include one dinner. B&amp;B rates range from \u00a325-\u00a339 per night, rising to \u00a330-\u00a345 from April. Three-course meals in the bar/restaurant cost around \u00a312. Surfed Out also arranges foreign surfing trips to destinations including Lanzarote and Costa Rica."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
