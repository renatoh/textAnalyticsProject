The London Olympics did it first, offering us a glimpse of a different nation from the one lodged so long in the collective imagination: not washed-up and living on past triumphs, but confident, capable and, above all, gloriously plural. While London 2012 sketched that picture through a series of impressions, sentimental and anecdotal, today we got the cold, hard facts to answer the perennial question: who do we think we are? Those facts came thanks to a new batch of numbers from the 2011 census, a statistical portrait of England and Wales, complemented by some extra figures from Northern Ireland (Scotland counts itself separately). What they proved, in unambiguous data, was that the photo-op image of Team GB as a changing nation of many hues was not PR fluff but demographic reality. Now it is confirmed that the country is less white and less Christian. In 2001, white people accounted for 91% of the total population. In the latest census, that figure is down five points to 86%. Those who define themselves, in the ugly parlance of the census, as \"white British\" now account for just 81% of the people. Not that this diversity is all about race or colour. Five percent of the population is made up of white newcomers, many of them from eastern Europe. The number of people living here but born outside the UK has risen to 7.5m, or 13% of the population. The league table of countries of origin shows Poland \u2013 not even in the top 10 in 2001 \u2013 in second place, sandwiched between India and Pakistan. Also on the list was Ireland, the US and, unexpectedly, Germany. Many of these could be the children of Britons who once lived abroad. Some of them could be students or others living in Britain temporarily. Either way, this is not immigration the way it was understood in the 1960s and 1970s: witness the 29% of Kensington and Chelsea made up of non-British white people, bankers and oligarchs relocated to west London. This is the result of globalisation, a mobility and churn in the world's population which involves Britain no more or less than the likes of France, Germany or the Netherlands. Put simply, people are on the move \u2013 and some of them are coming here. Alongside diversity are signs of integration. We aren't just more varied, we're also more mixed. The numbers identifying themselves as mixed race nearly doubled to 2.2%, with almost 12% of households including members of different ethnic groups. Sunder Katwala of the thinktank British Future believes a generational change has occurred: he hails a \"Jessica Ennis generation\", one that barely notices race at all. But God \u2013 or at least the church \u2013 is struggling in this country. Ten years ago 72% identified as Christians; now it's just 59%. The panicmongers on the reactionary right will compare that to the rise in the number of British Muslims to 2.7m \u2013 from 3% of the total population in 2001 to 5% now \u2013 and warn that Christianity will one day be outstripped by Islam. But the biggest challenge to Christian influence in our national life is not Islam, but rather the 25% who declared themselves to be of \"no religion\" at all, up from 15% in 2001. Non-believers now form the second-biggest denomination, dwarfing the number of Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jews and Buddhists combined. It confirms our place as perhaps the most godless country, the least \"churched\", in the industrialised world, setting us apart from the US, obviously, but also from much of continental Europe. This waning of religion might also explain one of the census's more striking numbers. While the Commons was debating marriage for same-sex couples, we learned that marriage is now officially a minority pursuit. Today only 46.6% of us are married, down from 50.9% in 2001. Perhaps a surge in new weddings for gay couples \u2013 and the census shows 105,000 Britons currently in civil partnerships \u2013 will give marriage the shot in the arm it clearly needs. In the summer, many noted that London was the obvious venue for an Olympics that showed off the new, more diverse Britain. The numbers confirm that intuition, establishing that when it comes to variety \u2013 ethnic, religious and national \u2013 the capital is worlds away from the rest of the country. White Britons have become a minority in London, accounting for only 45% of the city's population. White people still make up 60% of Londoners, the numbers boosted by newcomers from eastern Europe and beyond. The highest proportions of Muslims and every other religion are to be found in London \u2013 where (African) churches, mosques, temples and synagogues thrive. Christians are still the largest group, but they are no longer a majority. Tony Travers of the London School of Economics marvelled at the figures, which among other things showed that more than a third of Londoners are born overseas. \"It's a reminder of just how much we've changed,\" he said, like catching your reflection after 10 years without looking in a mirror. \"You know you've aged in that time, but it's still a shock to see it.\" There are nuggets galore for the researchers to pore over, whether it's the decline in home ownership, surely an early product of the recession, or the fact that there are now more of us with degree-level education than those with no qualifications. But the main story is surely that this country has undergone a radical transformation in this last decade and the ones before \u2013 and it has done so with relative peace and relative calm. No one will hand out any gold medals for that, but it's a kind of triumph all the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
