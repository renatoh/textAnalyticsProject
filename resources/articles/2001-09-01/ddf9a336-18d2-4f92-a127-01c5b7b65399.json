Its stance could bring it into conflict with the Treasury, which is concerned about lenders not passing on the full base rate cuts. If the Bank of England does cut rates by a quarter-point today, Abbey said it would only cut its own rate - now 6.75% - by about a tenth of a point, to \"protect\" its savers. In 1999, Abbey, Halifax and others were criticised for failing to pass on official interest rate cuts to mortgage-holders. \"Abbey's mortgage rates are at their lowest in 30 years, and it is the mortgage customers who have reaped the benefits,\" said a spokeswoman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
