The New Orleans-based 26-year-old has returned with 10 personal songs which reflect issues felt by young black Americans, from isolation (The Slow Drag Under) to political epiphany and a desire to \u201ctear this building down\u201d (All Was Well). With the barista turned bluesman\u2019s musical palette now stretching from retro soul to percussive electro, Right on You even answers his question about what Otis Redding might have sounded like had he been \u201cstrapped to a punk band\u201d. The consistent thread is Booker\u2019s raw electric guitar, and while there\u2019s perhaps too much going on for it all to hang together all the time, he\u2019s happiest at his simplest. Believe is disarmingly lovely and, in a crowded musical field, the Mavis Staples-accompanied title track is gospel soul at its most impassioned and euphoric."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
