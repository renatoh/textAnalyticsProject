His arrival maintains the Bolton manager Sam Allardyce's policy of recruiting high-profile overseas players on free transfers and high wages. With two European Golden Boots to his credit, Jardel's CV suggests he could be as successful as Youri Djorkaeff, Jay-Jay Okocha and Ivan Campo, if not more so. Jardel, who has a Portuguese passport, flew in for his medical after agreeing a deal worth about \u00a345,000 a week. That would make him the highest-paid player in the club's history but his goals ratio, including four years at Porto when he scored 150 goals in 146 games, entitles Allardyce to believe the outlay represents smart business. Jardel won the Golden Boot for the first time at Porto before a \u00a310m move to Galatasaray in 2000. After a year in Istanbul he joined Sporting Lisbon, scoring 42 times in his first season to finish as Europe's most prolific striker again. His career stalled last season when he was sidelined for two months with depression after marriage problems but, even though he claims to have made a full recovery, Sporting released him this summer. \"This is the opportunity I need to resurrect my career,\" he said. \"I still have the ability to score a lot of goals and I want to become a hero in Bolton and a success in the Premiership. I have always wanted to play in England and Bolton's reputation around Europe is extremely positive.\" Allardyce said: \"His goals-per-game ratio is second to none, anywhere in the world. We have found a striker who is going to score goals for us on a regular basis.\" Sean Davis is likely to be an Everton player by the weekend, with the Goodison club understood to be close to having their third offer for the England Under-21 midfielder accepted by Fulham. Middlesbrough are expected to match Everton's bid, which amounts to just over \u00a35m, and the player may meet the Teessiders out of courtesy, but the Goodison club are confident they will conclude the hunt for Davis's services as the season gets under way. Earlier in the day Everton failed with a second, improved bid of \u00a33.5m, rising to \u00a35m on appearances although, with Fulham close to signing a replacement in the \u00a32m Claudio Reyna from Sunderland, Davis, who last week asked for a transfer, will be free to move. The Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp has agreed terms with West Ham for the French defender S\u00e9bastien Schemmel. Redknapp said he was not deterred by the 28-year-old's reputation. He added: \"I don't mind the so-called bad boys because they keep you on your toes and make life interesting.\" Portsmouth are also considering Leeds' defender Ian Harte as a back-up option if they fail to sign the Argentina left-back Juan Pablo Sorin from Cruzeiro of Brazil. Talks with Sorin's representatives about a \u00a32m deal are at an advanced stage but Redknapp still plans to inquire whether Leeds' financial problems mean Harte is available. Leeds are seeking a buyer for the unsettled Mark Viduka and the only player who would not be sold is Alan Smith. Dave Jones is to sign a new, improved three-year deal as Wolves' manager before Saturday's Premiership opener at Blackburn and plans to stay at Molineux \"for many years\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
