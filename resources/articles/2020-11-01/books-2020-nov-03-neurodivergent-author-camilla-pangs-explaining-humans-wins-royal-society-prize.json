At 28, the post-doctoral scientist is both the youngest writer ever to win the \u00a325,000 prize, and the first writer of colour. She beat former winners Bill Bryson and Gaia Vince to take the award for Explaining Humans, which chair of judges Professor Anne Osbourn called \u201can intelligent and charming investigation into how we understand human behaviour, drawing on the author\u2019s superpower of neurodivergence\u201d. Pang hopes, she told the Guardian, to be \u201ca voice for the neurodivergent community in shining a light on the fact that it\u2019s OK to feel outlandish in a system that you\u2019re basically allergic to, because you\u2019re designed to make a new one\u201d. \u201cPang may have written this book as a manual to understand a world that sometimes feels alien to her, but it also allows neurotypicals to see the world from an entirely new perspective,\u201d said Osbourn, praising how Pang \u201cprovides insights into different ways of thinking and the challenges of being neurodiverse in a \u2018normal\u2019 world\u201d. The author, who has a PhD in biochemistry from UCL, was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at the age of eight, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at 26. She wrote Explaining Humans, she said, \u201cin order to survive and process my thoughts into coherent modules\u201d, creating a \u201cmanual for humans\u201d she could consult, looking at what proteins, machine-learning and molecular chemistry can teach us about human behaviour, from decisions and conflict to relationships and etiquette. \u201cWe get information from all of our different senses, but what if they\u2019re all really loud, and everything\u2019s really intense, and you\u2019ve got no filter, so you\u2019re stuck in this kind of soup of limbo, when you\u2019re trying to interpret these different signals that are really quite quiet? Most of the time, I was trying to figure out what was going on,\u201d she said. She wrote for herself, but also for her mother and her family. \u201cUp until the age of maybe 16, it was really hard to communicate what was happening, and all my mum wanted to do was understand the person that she loved and made. So I wrote for her, and also on behalf of all the other mums out there, and carers and parents, who have a person that they want to understand,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018How do I know this human so I can enable them? Am I going to upset them if I put on different perfume?\u2019 Everyone\u2019s got these different triggers. So it was a thank-you letter to my mum and also a love letter to science, to highlight how understanding and support can change someone\u2019s life, by seeing what a person is, as opposed to what they should be.\u201d Pang hopes the book \u201cwill give people that missing link so that they can feel complete enough to take the next step.\u201d At school, she struggled to make sense of the \u201cecosystem of playground species\u201d and never fitted in. \u201cMaybe it was the fact that I had a dedicated adult mentor sitting next to me in each class, my tendency to go into meltdown when a teacher said a word that scared me, or my uncontrollable nervous tics. I can\u2019t imagine my penchant for giant tubes of antiseptic cream did me any favours either,\u201d she writes, also revealing the \u201craging tempest\u201d inside her head. \u201cBecause my brain is having to work overtime to process all the data around it, considering everything from every possible angle, it becomes a pressure cooker which can boil over without warning,\u201d she writes. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s no alternative but to let out some of the noise that is pounding through my brain: banging my head against the table, screaming and shaking, running around in circles. Anything to release some of the pressure of just trying to exist.\u201d She decided she wanted to publish her writing \u201cduring a panic attack on the commute\u201d, and did a \u201csprint Google\u201d to find out how to go about it. She landed an agent quickly, and a book deal with Penguin, with Explaining Humans released at the start of the first lockdown. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you, it\u2019s been an absolute ball ache, but it has made me realise that even though you can\u2019t celebrate and hug the ones you love when you win awards because of lockdown, that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that what you\u2019ve done is actually all right. I\u2019m going to have to remind myself of that because I\u2019m not with my family and I\u2019m heartbroken that I can\u2019t see them, but that\u2019s OK because they\u2019re proud from afar,\u201d she said. \u201cWinning doesn\u2019t feel real yet, but it does feel like an incredible honour, to be up there with people I admire. To have it recognised that I can write, and that people resonate with the book, makes me feel like I have that piece of connection that has always been missing. And that it\u2019s OK to feel weird in other parts, because I know that this part will anchor me in feeling human for the rest of my life.\u201d The prize is intended to \u201cpromote the accessibility and joy of popular science books to the public\u201d. Previous winners include Stephen Hawking \u2013 a childhood hero of Pang\u2019s, who read A Brief History of Time at the age of eight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
