This week, the mental health crisis! Two malevolent \u201cEternal Beings\u201d, Zellin and Akara, have decided to amuse themselves for eternity by feeding off the nightmares of humanity, having identified us as pathetic saplings governed by our fear, shame and paranoia. There are also monsters running round a psych hospital in 14th-century Aleppo, for reasons of their own. This would be fertile ground for Doctor Who anyway, given that the show lives off nightmares and monsters under the bed and that special place behind the sofa. But new writer Charlene James delivers something more, with a rare chance to explore the internal lives of Team Tardis. As the Doctor drops her chums back for a home visit to Sheffield, it\u2019s not long before Zellin and his creepy removable fingers are getting under their skin and exacerbating their darkest moments. In a further welcome development for Mandip Gill, we get to see Yaz\u2019s past struggles with bullying and self-esteem issues. Ryan also can\u2019t shake the feeling that his new freewheeling intergalactic lifestyle has plunged his abandoned best mate Tibo deep into depression. And Graham has a more acute form of survivor\u2019s guilt, haunted by dreams of Grace, the wife he was unable to save (a welcome return cameo from Sharon D Clarke), and paranoia about his cancer returning. Not even the Doctor is safe, plagued in her own dreams and visions by clues about the prophecy of the Timeless Child. Certainly, this show has rarely felt further away from the jolly adventures of a Silurian detective, her lesbian lover and their Sontaran butler. However, what it does do is allow Jodie Whittaker\u2019s Doctor another one of her trademark empowering speeches, forcefully warning Zellin and Akara that humanity\u2019s ability to carry on through whatever challenges the mind may throw at us is a unique example of our strength and resilience. And Tibo ends up getting the help he needs. All we need now is a helpline. \u2018Try not freak out, yeah, but you\u2019re on a floating space platform trapped in a gravitational pull between two colliding planets \u2019 As has often been the case this year, the adventure itself is somewhat secondary to the theme here. Aside from the fact that you do actually need a plot, the whole business with Akara being imprisoned between planets, orbs, quantum fluctuation locks and whatnot was the least engaging element of Can You Hear Me? The Aleppo subplot also felt a little random. Certainly, it allowed for bonus wokeness. The plight of Tahira points out that atrocities in Syria are nothing new, and the Doctor gets to offer another history lesson, telling us: \u201cIslamic hospitals were known for the enlightened way they treated mental health problems.\u201d Life aboard the Tardis The Doctor is demonstrably lonely at being without her \u201cfam\u201d, even for 24 hours. But it\u2019s something she might have to get used to. This episode dropped the strongest hint yet that Team Tardis might be about to disband. Ryan in particular is unsettled by not being there for Tibo through his depression. \u201cIs this our life now,\u201d he wonders to Yaz, perhaps learning true responsibility, \u201ctravelling with the Doctor?\u201d Yaz points out that she told them they wouldn\u2019t return from their adventures the same, but the idea of developing at a different rate to that of his loved ones and inevitably growing apart is starting to sit uneasily. At any rate, Chris Chibnall has hinted at doom on the way. He said this week: \u201cIn Spyfall Part One, [the Doctor and the team] are buoyant and they\u2019re having fun. Where we leave them at the end of episode 10 is an entirely different place.\u201d Fear factor A story based around nightmares would do well to deliver some proper nightmare fuel. And Can You Hear Me? does not disappoint, the claw-around-the-face moment proving a particular standout, while Zellin\u2019s creepy detachable fingers persistently unsettle. It\u2019s a fact that probably the most marked improvement this year from Whittaker\u2019s debut series is that Doctor Who is scary again. Amen to that. Mysteries and questions Meanwhile, details are emerging about the imminent two-part finale. With the episodes now named as Ascension of the Cybermen and The Timeless Children, it will come as no surprise that the Doctor\u2019s second-deadliest enemies will take centre stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big Cyberman story, that last two-parter. There are a lot of Cybermen coming in this series,\u201d Chibnall told the Mirror. \u201cIt might start with one Cyberman, but you\u2019ll see a lot. It\u2019s as epic and emotional as the opening two-parter. I know it takes place across a big distance from space, there\u2019s fantastic spaceships, there\u2019s Cybermen.\u201d But is that really there all is to their return? Next week\u2019s episode is a historical one, featuring Mary Shelley and Lord Byron, and reveals that it was an encounter with the Cybermen that inspired the former to write Frankenstein. Or possibly just the one? Could Captain Jack\u2019s warning \u201cbeware the lone Cyberman\u201d be a reference to Frankenstein\u2019s actual monster \u2013 an abomination arising from the actions of those who would seek to amend humanity? Space and time will tell. Deeper into the vortex Good to know that the Doctor is an excellent tap dancer in a crisis. You never know when you might need that. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what big anniversary Yaz and her sister Sonia were marking? Was it just the day that Yaz didn\u2019t run away and got her confidence? Slightly odd ritual. Speaking of which, as we were following Yaz through a home visit, it was a shame not to see another appearance from Shobna Gultai as her mum. Meanwhile, exciting news from a different corner of the Whoniverse. John Barrowman may not be coming back on TV this year, but Captain Jack will be returning in a new series of the excellent Big Finish audio plays. Excitingly, he\u2019s being paired up with Alex Kingston\u2019s River Song, and Camille Coduri\u2019s Jackie Tyler to boot. Which is surely the very ultimate in fan service. \u201cIt\u2019s like Jack is the male River and River is the female Jack,\u201d said the actor. Next time It\u2019s time to visit Mary Shelley and Lord Byron as the series careers towards a conclusion. Get ready for The Haunting of Villa Diodati."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
