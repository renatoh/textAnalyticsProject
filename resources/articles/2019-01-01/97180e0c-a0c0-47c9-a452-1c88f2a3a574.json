Schools were half-empty, buses were harder to find, but apart from that, the capital was mostly calm, and there was little indication of the previous day\u2019s extraordinary events \u2013 or that two men now claim to be the country\u2019s rightful ruler. To roars of approval from thousands of supporters \u2013 and the enthusiastic support of the Trump administration \u2013 Juan Guaid\u00f3, the former head of the national assembly, declared himself interim president on Wednesday. It was the most brazen challenge so far to the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who immediately dismissed the move as a coup attempt orchestrated by an alliance of the \u201cfascist right\u201d and \u201cthe coup-mongering, interventionist gringo empire\u201d. Overnight, security forces clashed with protesters in the working-class neighborhood of Petare in eastern Caracas, and isolated incidents of looting occurred. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s bold gamble set the scene for a political standoff: neither side seems willing to budge, and each leader can count on international support. What that means for Venezuelans remains far from clear, said Alejandro Rond\u00f3n a 24-year-old management student who joined a pro-Maduro rally on Wednesday. \u201cWhat Mr Guaid\u00f3 did seems irresponsible to me: he is deceiving people \u2013 and he\u2019s leading us into a constitutional labyrinth it will be hard for us to get out of.\u201d Rond\u00f3n allowed that there were frustrations with the government but he was confident that the people would stick with Maduro \u2013 if only out of loyalty to his late mentor and predecessor. \u201cIn moments like this we close ranks because of our respect for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d And despite growing uncertainty over the country\u2019s future, life continued more or less as normal for Venezuelans on both sides of the political divide. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t get to work,\u201d said Simara Romero a 35-year-old waitress, who crosses Caracas twice a day for her job at a coffee shop in the east of the city. \u201cIt took me an hour to find a bus that would bring me to work. And now that I\u2019m here, we\u2019ve only had two clients.\u201d Venezuela has seen two previous attempts to unseat Maduro through mass street protests \u2013 both of which failed, prompting government crackdowns which left scores dead on both sides, and thousands jailed. So for many Caraque\u00f1os the latest unrest had an air of deja vu. \u201cI can\u2019t keep grinding my life to a halt every time there is trouble \u2013 it\u2019s endless here. And besides, you kind of know the drill,\u201d said Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, a graphics designer, as she carried her shopping to her car . \u201cI didn\u2019t take my kids to school, but other than that life must go on. It\u2019s not like me stopping is going to bring down the government,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I need to work because I need the money.\u201d Nearly 90% of Venezuelans live in poverty, so it was perhaps understandable that for many, the daily struggle to get by should take priority over political theatre. \u201cMy president is Juan Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 not because the US says so, but because I want him: I want a change. The country can\u2019t go on as it is,\u201d said Caty Aguilar, 54, as she headed out from home in Petare. She works three jobs as a house cleaner, and sells phone cards and individual cigarettes \u2013 but even that is barely enough to get by. Aguilar\u2019s daughter is one of the 3 million Venezuelans who has fled the country, and occasionally sends remittances back home from Peru, but Aguilar also relies on the occasional box of subsidized food handed out by the government. She said a local official had warned her she would lose the subsidy if she attended anti-government protests, but she shrugged off the threat. \u201cI just don\u2019t care any more. I don\u2019t think the government has the money to keep buying them much longer anyway,\u201d she said. Across the country, Venezuelans turned to the strategies they have relied on in previous outbreaks of political drama. \u201cI\u2019ve stocked up on food \u2013 although there is hardly anything to buy in the shops,\u201d said Victoria Daboin, 26, from the Andean city of M\u00e9rida in the west. \u201cThis [unrest] is typical, it always happens in the country when there\u2019s uncertainty.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said that many Venezuelan families have come up with methods to get through periods of turmoil: \u201cYou stock up on food a couple of days when you see it coming. You keep kids home. You obsessively check Twitter and WhatsApp \u2013 but you no longer forward every post because most videos of burning cities or wounded people are fake or from Nicaragua,\u201d she said. But this week\u2019s developments have added a new element of uncertainty to familiar rituals: since Guaid\u00f3 took his oath of office, neither he nor Maduro have made any significant public appearance or official indication of their plans. Internationally, supporters of the two men have lined up on familiar geopolitical lines: Russia, China, Cuba, Turkey and Nicaragua have backed Maduro; the US, the UK and most of Venezuela\u2019s Latin American neighbours have backed Guaid\u00f3. But how that support plays out on the ground remains unclear. When Donald Trump official recognized Guaid\u00f3 as president, Maduro responded quickly by giving all US diplomatic staff 72 hours to leave the country. However, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said that US diplomats would remain in Venezuela because Maduro \u2013 who he described as an \u201cex-president\u201d \u2013 lacks the legal authority to break off diplomatic relations\u201d. An email sent by the US embassy to its citizens in Venezuela emphasised they \u201care keeping regular hours\u201d and on Thursday morning the street outside the embassy was quiet, with no sign that Venezuelan security forces were preparing to enforce Maduro\u2019s deadline.
