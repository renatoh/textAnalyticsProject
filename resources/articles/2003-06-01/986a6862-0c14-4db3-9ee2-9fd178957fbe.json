It typifies the challenge of comprehensive education. Proud of its mixed-ability intake, it has boys from both middle-class areas and more deprived estates. William Ellis is doing something special. The ambition for every child is tailormade learning. The theory is simple: every child needs schooling personalised to his or her needs. Every parent is involved in decisions about their child's learning. Every teacher works with colleagues to assess pupils and deliver teaching to match. Every head of department reports to the governing body on the different performance of each class. This is a reform that should animate every secondary school. The technical term is 'Assessment for Learning'. Ofsted tells us it works, that it raises standards, but report that it is done in just four out of 10 schools. Every child, parent and teacher should expect it in their school. From the coming autumn, under proposals to be unveiled this week by Education Secretary Charles Clarke, every school will, at the click of a mouse, be able to compare and contrast the performance of individual pupils against other pupils in the school, and against similar pupils in other parts of the country. The powerful new analysis of pupil achievement will help schools meet this challenge. The new data is based on 'value added', the improvement made by pupils between 11 and 16, taking into account prior attainment, poverty and gender. The new data challenges the combination of poverty of expectations and culture of quiet under-achievement that can all too easily hold back pupil progress. It poses as many challenges for schools in the 'leafy suburbs' as it does for those in the inner-cities. We must raise standards in schools where results are reassuring but potential is still not fulfilled. Academic researchers call them 'coasting' schools. I know teachers in these schools are working hard. We need to give them the tools to help their pupils. There are five key aspects to the reform agenda necessary to make the most of Assessment for Learning. First, every pupil needs a curriculum that is inspiring and interesting in the early years of secondary education. Too many pupils, particularly boys, are just bored at this age. But it also applies critically between the ages of 14 and 19, when we need to develop a curriculum based on the choices of individual students. It has been a straitjacket for too long. Second, we need to embrace the potential of information and communication technology. For pupils, this can make a reality of personal learning paced to meet individual needs. For teachers, ICT can create opportunities to access a wide range of resources that simplify preparation and enrich the delivery of lessons. It also allows school leaders greater freedom to innovate and promotes collaboration between schools, parents, teachers and pupils. Third, we need to recognise that individual pupils need individual attention. That is the significance of the recruitment of 80,000 support staff into schools since 1997, and the commitment to an extra 50,000 in this parliament, backing up the extra 25,000 teachers recruited since 1997. These are people drawn from the community who use their expertise in drama, sport or science to support teachers, or work as learning mentors with disaffected young people. Fourth, we need to ensure teachers have the time and support to use assessment to design and develop support for pupils. That is the significance of the commitment to ensure that from 2005 all teachers have at least 10 per cent of teaching time guaranteed for preparation of lessons. Fifth, we need to recognise that pupils across the country have special needs. These can be formal statements, or they can be the unmet needs of some ethnic minority pupils, or those of disaffected white boys, some of the lowest achievers in our system. They can also be the needs of gifted and talented pupils. Assessment for Learning requires calm and ordered schools. We will continue to help heads and teachers promote good discipline in our classrooms. Changing the culture takes time. Dealing with poor behaviour is a prerequisite for reforming secondary education. The 2001 Labour manifesto promised investment and reform to deliver better public services. But however great the investment in public services, reform is the way to make that investment go further. The political debate about public-service reform revolves around two key ideas. First, whether excellence and equity can be combined. Second, whether universal public services can also offer provision personalised to the needs of individual citizens. The answer of the Conservatives is clear. They say inequality is the price of excellence and that public services need to be broken up to deliver a personal service. But the Left must not fall into the trap of accepting that innovation can be a casualty of the drive for equity. High standards do not come from standardised service. Our case must be that excellence can be a battering ram against inequality, and universal provision the right basis on which to address the particular needs of individual citizens. In education, international data sets out the challenge. Pupils here are, on average, high achievers, thanks to what Ofsted says are the highest standards of teaching ever. But inequality in achievement is higher in this country than in almost any other. Seven years ago, an international study said that primary attainment was average. Today, Britain is third in the world for the achievement of 10-year-olds. That is a tribute to teachers and to pupils. To fulfil the potential of these children through secondary education we need to make them a new offer, a universal service tailored to their needs, delivering quality and equity wherever you are from and wherever you live. \u00b7David Miliband MP is the Schools Standards Minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
