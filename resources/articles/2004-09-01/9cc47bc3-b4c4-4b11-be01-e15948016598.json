Sturrock on his performance. \"It wasn't as if results were that bad, and at the time I left I really felt I was getting to grips with things.\" Sturrock on players and their egos: \"The standard of Premiership players is higher than those in the Football League, but they can be very strong-minded - they have to be to deal with the pressures at this level - and I think you have to take more care in how you deal with them. The ego factor with top-flight players today is more pronounced. They have greater power and generally you can't afford to be as rough handed with them as you can with the hardened pros in the Football League.\" Sturrock on his profile: \"I was tarred with a certain brush. I'm sure some people looked upon me as a virtual nobody just up from the sticks. I think it started with one or two dissatisfied players making critical comments to their agents and these being leaked to the media. The whole thing just mushroomed and got out of control.\" Sturrock on his mistakes: \"Having been able to look into the goldfish bowl over the last few weeks, as opposed to being in it, I can see that I made some mistakes - there's no doubt about that. But I know that these can only make me stronger 'I am probably a better manager now than I was when I joined Southampton. No matter how experienced you might be, there is always something to learn. Being with Southampton was a tremendous learning curve for me. People say: \"Haven't you lost a bit of confidence in your ability? The answer is no - quite the reverse.\" The full interview appears in The Observer, available on Sunday 19 September. -ends- Please note: Any use of this material must credit The Observer as its source.
