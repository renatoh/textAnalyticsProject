As we all know, it's one of the big flashpoints of the year for rows, stress and financial pressure. The travel industry has reported - almost to its own surprise - that bookings for holidays abroad this Christmas are at the same levels as last year. It's easy to see the attraction, especially if you don't have kids. It can feel a bit odd waking up in your mid-years in your parents' spare bedroom, opening a stocking full of tangerines at the end of your bed. And even if you get on well with your folks, it's nice to have a Christmas away from pud, Monopoly and paper hats. Four years ago, my husband and I ran off to north-east Brazil for Christmas. The flights were double the price of other times of the year, but the opportunity to travel during a period when very little happens in the business world made sense (although our parents have yet to forgive us). We travelled by bus across giant sand dunes for hours from Fortaleza to a tiny coastal village called Jericoacoara (better known to locals as 'Jeri'). We woke with the cock crowing in a small pousada on Christmas day in this tiny one-shop town, where the only electricity was via a small generator. We packed a small rucksack and walked barefoot in swimwear along the barren seashore for five hours to the next settlement, Tatajuba, wading through the odd river to get there. Arriving at about 1pm in Tatajuba, we found a man lying in a hammock on the verandah of a small pousada . We were the only guests checking into this five-room inn atop a sand dune with no phone or links with the outside world. The innkeeper wasn't expecting guests so he sent a couple of his children down to the local river to catch some fish which his wife cooked us for lunch. We sat looking out across the sand dunes to the sea. It was the most relaxing, uncommercialised Christmas I've ever experienced. It's good at least once in your life to experience December without Old Spice, Argos and the horrible drain of the January sales ads appearing on the TV on the 26th when you're still recovering from the excesses of the previous day. Two close friends have separately decided to take advantage of their single status and flee Christmas this year. One has booked a train ticket to Barcelona where she will spend four nights in a B&amp;B reading books and strolling about by herself (her children are going to her ex-husband); the other is backpacking around the Far East. Scary? Refreshing, I say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
