His career at Manchester United has incorporated more serious injuries (four) than medals (three) but Sir Alex Ferguson has never wavered in his view that Brown will ultimately be remembered for the sturdiness of his defending rather than the fragility of his knees. Ferguson was accompanied by Roy Keane in reserving special acclaim for Brown's role in nullifying the Arsenal attack but the compliments did not just emanate from the United camp. \"Wes Brown has had a hard time but now he is showing he is back to his best,\" Thierry Henry said of a player whose displays, both at Villa Park and at Highbury a week earlier, must surely have elevated him back into Sven Goran Eriksson's plans for Euro 2004. \"Wes is a huge bonus for us,\" said Keane. \"When he first came back we were going through a dodgy phase and he became a scapegoat. But, when Wes is on top of his game, from a tackling point of view, there is no one better. He's had terrible luck with injuries but every day in training you can see his sharpness coming back.\" In terms of England it will not be known whether Brown's return to form and fitness has come too late or, indeed, has been timed impeccably, until Eriksson names his 23-man squad for the summer championships on May 17. The Swede will probably want four central defenders and, going on the basis that John Terry, Sol Campbell and Jonathan Woodgate are assured of their places and that Rio Ferdinand is banned from any sort of football until September, Brown's renaissance could be bad news for Matthew Upson and Gareth Southgate. \"In England, people look for problems but you have John Terry, Wes Brown, Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand when he is available,\" said Henry. \"You are not doing badly.\" The Frenchman seemed bemused by the criticism that Brown had endured because of the rustiness of his first few matches back in the team, a period that coincided with United being knocked out of the Champions League and all but hoisting the white flag in the title race. \"Everyone makes mistakes,\" said Henry. \"The important thing is that you have to remember that Wes Brown has had a cruciate ligament injury.\" In fact, Brown has ruptured the cruciate ligaments in both knees. He missed the entire 1999-2000 campaign while his right knee was repaired and he has just come back from a seven-month lay-off after feeling a snap in his left knee in the final match of last season. He also broke his ankle in a Champions League qualifying tie in Hungary and, continuing the theme of grave misfortune, medial ligament damage forced a four-month absence two seasons ago. \"He's had two cruciate injuries and a broken ankle so he can't be full of confidence but everyone's seen how he's played in the past week,\" said Ferguson. \"Some of the criticism he has faced has been totally unfair. All he ever needed was a run of games to get his fitness back and he's been getting better and better with each match.\" As Brown again rebuilds his career, Dennis Bergkamp, one of the Arsenal forwards left flummoxed by him on Saturday, faces the end of his, unless he rethinks his role at the club, according to the manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. \"Mentally, of course he deserves a new contract as he's been amazing. But you have to consider, at his age, that it's short-term,\" Wenger said of his 34-year-old striker who is seeking a one-year deal. \"It also depends on him as to what he will accept.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
