The centre will miss the World Cup for England after having been convicted on three charges of assault, two of which are against female police officers. However, if he were to make the move to France he may have played his last game for England, as Stuart Lancaster has maintained the policy of not selecting those \u2013 such as Steffon Armitage (Toulon) and Nick Abendanon (Clermont) \u2013 who play outside of England. Tuilagi is contracted to Leicester until 2017, but the French broadcaster RMC has reported that \u201ccontact has been established between the English international and the chairman of the Stade Toulousain, Rene Bouscatel.\u201d Leicester will be dismayed by the news, having stood by Tuilagi during his latest controversy and in 2011 when he marked the end of the World Cup by jumping from a ferry in Auckland Harbour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
