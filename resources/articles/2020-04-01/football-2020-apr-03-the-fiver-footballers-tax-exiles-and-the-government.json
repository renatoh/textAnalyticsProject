Step forward Matt Hanc0ck, whose turn it was to stand behind a lectern and address the nation at the daily coronavirus briefing The Fiver and many other UK citizens have come to regard as Time to Uncork the First Bottle of the Evening O\u2019Clock. Having come up woefully short in ensuring underfunded NHS staff possess, at the very least, the tests and basic protective equipment needed to go about their desperately important and dangerous business, the health secretary responded to one question by attempting to emotionally blackmail top-flight footballers. \u201cI think the first thing that Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution, take a pay cut and play their part,\u201d said Hanc0ck, throwing a group largely comprised of working-class lads who\u2019ve done well for themselves under the bus to distract from his own many shortcomings. And all while conspicuously failing to include assorted folk who earn significantly more than elite footballers, while contributing comparatively less to government coffers because they\u2019re all tax exiles. \u201cNHS workers have been underpaid for years,\u201d retorted Crystal Palace defender Andros Townsend on Friday morning, coming out swinging (albeit from a socially appropriate distance). \u201cOnly 2,000 of them have been able to be tested for coronavirus. This is not right, these people are putting their lives on the line to try and save lives. He is coming out and deflecting on to the easy targets, the footballers, and that doesn\u2019t sit right with me. We do have a responsibility but we are giving back to the community and rightly so. We are in a very privileged position. The community effectively pay our wages.\u201d Next up was Harry Maguire, a man with a slab of granite for a forehead and a heart of 24-carat gold. Perhaps fearing that any money \u201craised\u201d from Manchester United players deciding to take a pay cut would simply remain in the pockets of the Glazer family, the club captain instead called on teammates to donate 30% of their wages to help Manchester hospitals. With players from top-tier clubs now following suit and doing the government\u2019s job for them, it will be interesting to see if Hanc0ck takes the credit for nudging them in the right direction or calls on the likes of bankers, hedge fund managers and \u2013 heaven forfend \u2013 his own party to follow suit by also helping those less fortunate than themselves. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt was not the right decision to stage the match. It is definitely one to be included on the list for learning and for a future inquiry, so that organisations can learn and not make similar mistakes\u201d \u2013 Matthew Ashton, Liverpool city council\u2019s director of public health, says the game against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at Anfield should not have gone ahead.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cTeddy Sheringham (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) had way too much class for the superficial Cool Britannia. Speciously labelling some stuff as cool now is why your trousers look stupid, the craft Tin you are drinking is, face it, unpleasantly over-hopped, and that lovingly and expensively constructed vinyl and valve amp setup sounds slightly worse than the radio in your partner\u2019s Ford Fiesta (other mediocre hatchbacks with budget stereos are available). And Teddy was in no way mixed up with anyone having to endure a Menswear gig in 1997\u201d \u2013 Jon Millard. \u201cCan we have more of readers\u2019 least favourite games, please.

JUST NEWS Premier League players will be asked to take a 30% drop in their wages, via cuts or deferrals or both, following a meeting on Friday afternoon. The move came as the 20 top-flight teams said they would give \u00a3125m to the Football and National Leagues to help their clubs through the crisis and donate \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups. Jordan Henderson has also contacted his fellow Premier League captains to organise a coronavirus fund that will raise millions of pounds for the NHS. In a bid to prevent premature voiding, Uefa has warned that it may not accept clubs into next season\u2019s Big Cup if they haven\u2019t qualified in the normal way. And Chelsea have teamed up with domestic abuse charity Refuge to help provide support for people forced to self-isolate in vulnerable situations. \u201cI am proud to lead the club\u2019s support of this worthy cause during such a difficult time for so many,\u201d said Emma Hayes.
