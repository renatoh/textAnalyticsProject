The fairytale script had been drafted when Sean St Ledger, the Middlesbrough defender playing in his first Dublin international, stooped to plant an 87th-minute header past Gianluigi Buffon, arguably the world's finest goalkeeper. St Ledger's first international goal would surely guarantee the scalp of the world champions. Yet few teams can fuse joy and despair quite so potently as the Republic of Ireland. Three minutes later this vast amphitheatre witnessed another frenzy of emotion when the Italy substitutes' bench emptied to create a mass celebration of Alberto Gilardino's equaliser. The relief on Italian faces told only half the story. Ireland were, to quote several of their players, \"absolutely devastated\". \"It actually feels like we have been knocked out of the World Cup,\" said the goalkeeper Shay Given. This, of course, was untrue. While Italy advanced to the finals in South Africa as Group Eight winners, Ireland have ensured a place in next Monday's play-off draw. But it was abundantly clear that Ireland will be knocked out of the World Cup in their two-legged play-off tie if they cannot stop throwing away leads. It has been the curse of Irish football over the years and, in this campaign alone, they have done it five times, although they did recover to beat Cyprus in Nicosia. Their play-off opponents, in all probability, will be Russia, France, Greece or Portugal, and none are known for their forgiving natures. \"It's very disappointing,\" said the defender Richard Dunne. \"Against Italy, it's not that much of a problem but if it happens to us next month, it could end our chances.\" It was galling enough that Ireland had allowed Mauro Camoranesi, Italy's smallest player, to head the game's first equaliser from an Andrea Pirlo corner but Gilardino's expert finish stuck in the craw. With the game almost won, Ireland surrendered possession in the Italy half and were promptly hit on the counter-attack. To their Italian manager Giovanni Trapattoni, this was akin to heresy. Trapattoni joked that his team had been so over-excited and foolishly keen to add a third goal that there had been an exodus at the back to rival that led by Moses. With John O'Shea out of position, Pirlo sprang Italy forward down Ireland's exposed right side and, in the blink of an eye, Gilardino had found space to convert Vincenzo Iaquinta's cut-back. Trapattoni was last seen by the crowd gesticulating wildly as he headed for the dressing-room. \"He was screaming in Italian in the tunnel,\" said the midfielder Liam Lawrence, who made an encouraging competitive debut. \"But he didn't show his anger in the dressing-room.\" Trapattoni said that a more experienced and wilier team would have closed out the game. He called on his players to be more calculating and suggested that a bit of time-wasting or breaking up of the play could be required in the future. The end-to-end mindset of his Premier League players had to change. \"Three or four of them were a bit nervous,\" he added, \"but there was no reason because two times, we were in a very good position.\" One of the niggling concerns for Ireland as they look beyond Wednesday night's final group tie and dead rubber against Montenegro and towards the play-offs is that they have not beaten a highly ranked opponent since their 1-0 victory over Holland in a World Cup qualifying tie at Lansdowne Road in 2001. But Trapattoni is not interested in the past and he believes that his unbeaten team, from whom he is undoubtedly wringing the maximum, ought to fear no one. Croke Park had finally realised its potential to create an invigorating football atmosphere and the minutes after St Ledger's goal, when the stadium rocked to a delirious beat, will live long in the memory. So will those after Ireland's opening goal, which was curled home first time and beautifully from the edge of the penalty area by Glenn Whelan, after Lawrence had pulled back a low free-kick. Whelan welled up with tears during and after his celebrations. Trapattoni said that if it had been a boxing match, Italy would have won \"55-45\" but it was Ireland who sought the late knockout blow. Trapattoni and his assistant Marco Tardelli appeared to disagree over whether St Ledger should be sent up for Stephen Hunt's free-kick, with Trapattoni prevailing, but Given's desire to go forward as well was vetoed by the manager. \"He [Trapattoni] wanted to see the game out at 1-1 and we had a bit of a row,\" said Given. \"It's about opinions. If we had seen it out after Sean's goal, we would have been a lot happier.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
