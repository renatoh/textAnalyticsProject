On a day when sunshine contended with squally showers, and Taunton hosted its first men\u2019s ODI in 20 years, the Quantocks felt like the perfect rural backdrop for some over-optimistic batting \u2013 against a Kiwi attack that will certainly test more mature technique in this tournament. Aftab Alam \u2013 whose 80s headband complemented the retro village vibe \u2013 took three wickets in the Kiwi reply, adding an extra touch of quirk as Martin Guptill looped an inside edge to backward point off the very first ball of their innings. He walked off smiling, sensing, perhaps, that this was a day for humour, not tragedy. In the end, New Zealand made the 173 they needed in just 32.1 overs. This was entertainment of the holiday kind, to be bracketed alongside the guy shredding on his electric cricket-bat guitar, or the volunteer juggling foam bats for kids behind the Ondaatje pavilion. At one stage, Gulbadin Naib\u2019s men lost four wickets for four runs, flinging the willow with an abandon as joyous as it was misguided. Only Hashmatullah Shahidi\u2019s 59 showed any serious bent. James Neesham, meanwhile, picked up five wickets for 31, the best figures of the World Cup so far, not to mention of his own professional career. He has talked candidly of how close he came to quitting the game entirely in the past 18 months. Dropped from the squad after the 2017 Champions Trophy, he found himself bitter and angry whenever he took to the field and lost all pleasure in cricket. But he has since let go of his crippling perfectionism, and his role since his return in January has been one of support rather than stardom. His bat has been needed only three times in their last seven games and he\u2019s thrown the ball only when Henry, Boult and Ferguson have all finished with it. Against Bangladesh, Neesham was brought off after his two overs shed 24 runs in an otherwise parsimonious bowling performance, and he admitted later that he had been \u201ca little disappointed\u201d with his bowling in this World Cup, prompting a few tweaks in the nets. At Taunton, with its short straight boundaries, his run-up seemed to begin almost at the sightscreen, and he found extra rhythm and pace in a wicket that suited a bowler who hits the deck hard. He was so surprised when Williamson signalled him to warm up after the 10th over that he had a look behind him to see who was at point. \u201cBut I was pretty happy to get the new ball and didn\u2019t really let it out of my hand after that.\u201d Neesham was helped in no small part by Lockie Ferguson\u2019s thunderbolts at the other end. One of Ferguson\u2019s four wickets was Rashid Khan, who was out when a nasty length ball ricocheted off his helmet onto his off stump. Rashid played no further part in the game, although the good news for Afghanistan was that he was not expected to need treatment. There was a glorious glimpse, at the start of the match, of Afghanistan\u2019s best side. Hazratullah came out swinging in the most literal sense: he took three consecutive fours off Matt Henry\u2019s first over. Sometimes his hitting was art \u2013 a whip to fine leg off Lockie Ferguson\u2019s first ball \u2013 and sometimes it was agriculture. Hoicking to deep midwicket, he sent Colin de Grandhomme and Martin Guptill off on a collision course, both men failing to reach the ball. Two balls later, he did the same again, and had three fielders converging on the same spot. They still all missed it. At the other end, Noor Ali was unrolling deliciously wristy shots both sides of the wicket, and within 11 overs they had put together their team\u2019s second highest partnership of the tournament. But Hazratullah\u2019s dismissal, caught at backward point, contained a terrible inevitability, and by the time captain Gulbadin was out \u2013 struggling so hard to reach the ball that he was the last to realise he\u2019d edged it \u2013 Afghanistan had toppled from 66-0 to 70-4. Afghanistan\u2019s batting has born a certain naivety throughout this World Cup \u2013 unsurprising given that many players have grown up with the six-and-out mentality of 10-over games. But it\u2019s an issue they\u2019ll have to address if they aim to be in international cricket for a long time, and not just a good one. It\u2019s possible that, arriving in England as everyone\u2019s favourite second team, the players\u2019 self-estimation has been raised a little too high, while the expectations of their passionate fans have brought a new kind of pressure. \u201cWhen you\u2019re losing games, it\u2019s really difficult in the dressing room, but I know my team-mates,\u201d said Gulbadin. \u201cWe played a lot of good cricket this past year, so we\u2019re trying to do the best with what we have. The morale is still high for the boys \u2013 we just need one good match.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
