Australian authorities said they were analysing photographs of the objects. The Chinese patrol ship Haixun 01, one of six ships in the area, had made it to the new search zone on Friday and was being asked to try and locate the objects. \u2022 The search team has moved the search nearly 700 miles closer to Australia after new analysis showed the plane was traveling faster, and therefore using more fuel, than previously thought. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said the plane would not have made it as far into the Indian Ocean before running out of fuel and crashing. \u2022 Despite the seeming setback, search planes are able to spend more time in the area because aircraft now need less fuel to reach their destination, giving them more time to analyze the space. This new search area is also outside the \u201croaring forties\u201d which frequently creates challenging weather. \u201cI'm not sure we'll get perfect weather out there but it's likely to be better more often than we've seen in the past,\u201d said John Young, general manager of the Amsa emergency response division. \u2022 Authorities estimate that they have nine days or fewer to locate the black box flight recorder before it\u2019s battery expires, according to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cHowever it is viewed, the challenges in ever finding the wreck and black box of MH370 grow with each day that passes,\u201d said the University of Southampton\u2019s Dr. Simon Boxall. \u2022 Relatives of passengers on flight MH370 staged a mass walk out of a briefing by Malaysian officials in Beijing. This protest comes three days after families of the lost passengers marched to the Malaysian embassy in Beijing. Officials in the Australian-lead search have said that the change in search area is customary for search missions of this magnitude. \"I don't count the original work a waste of time,\" John Young, an official at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, told The Wall Street Journal. Investigators aren't saying for sure that this will be the final search area. Officials from both Australia and Malaysia said the data may be analyzed again, prompting them to look elsewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. \"It's possible that further analysis may change [the search area] again,\" said Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. \"At this stage we don't expect significantly, but there are no guarantees in that area.\" The new area is more hospitable than the previous search zone. Air crews will no longer have to battle the \"Roaring 40s\"\u2014an area of strong winds and high seas. The likelihood of better weather may mean the search will face fewer stoppages after aircrews were grounded by gale winds twice this week. It is also closer to the Australian mainland, extending the amount of time planes spend in the search area before returning to base to refuel. Reuters reports on the diplomatic sensitivities in a search operation that includes military equipment and personnel from at least six different countries. The pot-bellied silhouette of a Chinese Il-76 military transport plane appeared in the sky over Perth International Airport just as the US naval officer was explaining how he guards his cutting-edge surveillance plane. Lieutenant Commander Adam Schantz was ticking off the measures, including a round-the-clock guard and armed rapid response team, as he caught sight of the Chinese aircraft coming in to land a few meters from the US Navy's P8 Poseidon for which he is responsible. The search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is producing strange bedfellows. \"Yeah, it's a little different,\" Schantz said with a laugh. In the wake of MH370\u2019s disappearance, aviation experts have criticized the black box system. Among the critics is Canadian engineer Pierre Jiennoy, who worked on black box technology 40 years ago. Jiennoy told the CBC that the current black box is \u201cobsolete.\" Jiennoy is now on the board of one of two Canadian firms that have already built black box systems that live stream flight data. Calgary-based FLYHT Aerospace Solutions sells a similar system. Called the Automated Flight Information Reporting System (AFIRS), FLYHT's product combines the infrastructure of the internet and the constellation of 66 satellites operated by Virginia-based Iridium Communications. When a plane experiences an adverse event, AFIRS can send streaming data off the aircraft to one of Iridium's 66 satellites and then down to ground-based servers, where the message is interpreted and sent to the airline. The infrastructure for this type of system has existed since about 2000, but it wasn't until after the Air France crash that airlines took it seriously, says Richard Hayden, sales director for FLYHT. The article also explains why airline companies have not incorporate this technology. While there is widespread approval of a live-streamed black box system, most airlines see the cost of integrating it prohibitive, says Bill Norwood, vice-president of products and technology for JDA Aviation Technology Solutions, a Maryland-based consultancy firm. Norwood says that the airline industry is reticent to add costs that will further erode the bottom line. This is an industry with notoriously low profit margins, he says. Search operations moved northeast on Friday because of new analysis showing that the plane traveled faster, and therefore ran out of fuel more quickly, than originally expected. The AP reports on the day\u2019s debris sightings: Five out of 10 aircraft hunting for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 found objects of various colors Friday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. It said it was not clear whether the objects were from the plane, and photos of them would be analyzed overnight. AMSA said the items included two rectangular objects that were blue and grey - among the colors of the missing plane. A Chinese patrol ship in the area will attempt to locate the objects on Saturday, it said. The three-week hunt for the jet has been filled with possible sightings, with hundreds of objects identified by satellite and others by plane, but so far not a single piece of debris has been confirmed. CNN national correspondent Kyung Lah was on board a P-8 Poseidon aircraft for four hours during Friday\u2019s search operation. In that time, she said the crew reported spotting potential debris. On Saturday attention is likely to focus on the Chinese patrol ship, Haixun 01, which has been asked to try to recover the objects spotted in the various aircraft sightings today. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the Haixun 01 \"will be in a position to relocate the objects on Saturday\". China's state broadcaster CCTV has images of the Haixun 01 arriving in the area. Here's that New Zealand spotter plane landing at Perth. It was one of five aircraft to have detected several objects in the new search zone, during Friday's operation. Here's a summary of today's developments: Five search aircraft have spotted \"multiple objects\" in a revised search area which has become the new focus of the hunt for the wreckage of MH370. The Australian Maritime and Safety Authority said it was analysing photographs from the search flights. A Chinese patrol ship, the Haixun 01, which is in the area, has been asked to try to relocate the objects. An airman on a New Zealand Orion spotter plane announced \"we have entered the debris field\", according to a Times reporter who was on board the flight. An image of an object said to have been taken from the New Zealand Orion showed a white square panel. The search zone has shifted almost 700 miles closer to Australia after investigators calculated the plane was going faster and using more fuel when it disappeared than previously thought. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the analysis was based on the plane's final radar contacts and suggested the plane would have burned more fuel in the opening stages of its flight. Oceanographers said that satellite images taken earlier this week hundreds of miles further south-west, are unlikely to show debris from the missing plane. Malaysia said ocean drift meant the satellite images could be consistent with the new area, but Australia played down the satellite sightings, saying the search had \"moved-on\". One expert said it was \"incorrect\" to state that debris could have drifted so far south-west from the new assumed crash site. Another said misleading satellite images were hampering the search. The UK's Air Accident Investigation's Board, which helped Malaysia to calculate that MH370 had crashed into the Indian Ocean, has defended its decision not to brief Chinese relatives about its calculations. A spokesman for the AAIB said it was Malaysia was leading the investigation so it was right its officials briefed the relatives. Angry relatives of the lost passengers have staged another protest at Malaysia by staging a walk out of a briefing by Malaysian officials in Beijing. The walkout comes three days after relatives marched on the Malaysian embassy in Beijing demanding answers about the missing plane. Malaysia Airlines has pledged to fly relatives of the missing passengers to Perth if wreckage is found. It said the \"the well-being and feelings of family members are and have always been close to our hearts and minds\". Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has tweeted a picture of what it claims is one of the photos of objects spotted by that New Zealand search flight. The Times, which had a reporter on board the search flight, tweets a very similar image. Times reporter Bernard Lagan was on board that New Zealand Orion when a potential debris field, including a large blue panel, was spotted. He reports: After covering 1,666km (1,035 miles), the Orion descended to a height of 500ft and the four spotters immediately reported seeing objects through the windows. \u201cIt is my impression that we have entered a debris field,\u201d the aircraft\u2019s tactical co-ordinator announced over the radio. Wing Commander Rob Shearer, who piloted the Orion, described it as \u201ca bit of a frustrating day\u201d. He told The Times: \u201cWe\u2019re looking for that one piece of evidence that ties objects in the water to the event, the potential accident. All we got was a lot of small contacts in the area.\u201d Wing Commander Shearer agreed that the large blue object picked up by his team did look \u201cpromising\u201d and that the number of objects pointed to some kind of debris field. \u201cThere was a lot of objects, but we dont know if that was from the event or it could have been a whole bunch of stuff washed off a fishing boat or a container ship,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean by looking for that one definitive piece of evidence.\u201d On a clear day with little cloud and with sea conditions calmer than in recent days, the crew was able to pick out up to 14 objects. The largest was a light blue panel about four metres square that was clearly picked up by the three cameras on the belly of the aircraft and relayed to screens inside. The New Zealand crew had actually been assigned to search an area further to the west but dropped a tracker beacon over the debris field before moving on. An Australian air crew later dropped a smoke flare over the area to help a ship heading towards it at full steam as night fell. Five search aircraft have spotted several objects of various colours during Friday\u2019s operation in the revised search zone, the Australian Maritime and Safety Authority has revealed. In a new statement it said the search had finished for today after 256,00 square kilometers were sureyed. Photographic evidence is being analysed. The statement added: The objects cannot be verified or discounted as being from MH370 until they are relocated and recovered by ships. A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion reported sighting a number of objects white or light in colour and a fishing buoy. A Royal Australian Air Force P3 Orion relocated the objects detected by the RNZAF Orion and reported it had seen two blue/grey rectangular objects floating in the ocean. A second RAAF P3 Orion spotted various objects of various colours in a separate part of the search area about 546 kilometres away. A total of ten planes were tasked by AMSA in today\u2019s search and all have now departed the search area. AMSA has tasked Chinese Maritime Administration patrol ship, Haixun 01, which is in the search area and will be in a position to relocate the objects on Saturday. Friday\u2019s search area was shifted north after international air crash investigators in Malaysia provided the latest credible lead available to AMSA. This was on the advice of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). Weather conditions in the area are expected to be reasonable for searching on Saturday. The sheer volume of potentially misleading satellite imagery of possible objects in the southern Indian Ocean could be hampering the search, according to a leading oceanographer. Dr. Simon Boxall from the University of Southampton, also cast doubt on the \"objects\" claimed to have been spotted in some of the recently released satellite images. In an email to my colleague Louis Degenhardt, he said: The burgeoning number of prospective satellite sightings could now detract from the main search objectives, to locate (any) confirmed surface debris from a Boeing 777. Take the Thai image as a good example which supposedly shows several hundred \"targets\" in a small area. As someone who has analysed optical images of the oceans for many years, all but two to three of these objects are likely to be sea-foam and wave breaking. This image was taken at a time of high winds and the pattern is consistent with hundreds I've seen over the years. It is also important to emphasise that the ocean is sadly full of debris from many sources which moves rapidly in this region of fast flowing and complex currents. The fact that no confirmed sightings have been made from aircraft or ships in the original area lends support to a shift in focus. On the new shift in search area, Boxall commented: The only known is the approximate last known location of MH370 based on the Inmarsat data analysis, which is correct beyond all reasonable doubt. I don't know the source and logistic of the new data that the aircraft was travelling faster (and hence using more fuel) than previously thought but the limit of the flight path of MH370 will be determined by fuel capacity. On this basis the new search does make sense, though the limited information about the sea floor in the region does mean that the topography of the area is more mountainous, making subsequent sonar searches more difficult. However it is viewed, the challenges in ever finding the wreck and black box of MH370 grow with each day that passes. Here's video of today's media briefing in Kuala Lumpur. An oceanographer has told the Guardian that Malaysia is \"incorrect\" to suggest that wreckage could have drifted hundreds of miles south-west of the revised assumed crash site. Malaysia's transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said satellite images of objects could be consistent with the new search zone. But this was challenged by Charitha Pattiaratchi, Winthrop professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia. In an email to my colleague Louis Degenhardt,he said: I just heard that they had announced in Malaysia - in a press briefing that there is a connection between the site in the Southern Ocean and the new search area. This is hearsay - they had claimed that the debris identified by the Chinese, French and Thai satellites may have originated from the new search area and is consistent with the shift to the new region. If they said this - it is incorrect ! There is absolutely no connection, in terms of the debris between the two locations which are 1000 km apart. In the southern location the debris was moving eastward and were trapped in eddies. Professor Pattiaratchi provided chart showing debris tracks from the new search area. He explained: The colours represent those originating from the same colour point along the aircraft track. The square is the the current proposed search area. The red square at towards the bottom shows the southern search area. Before they walked out of that briefing in Beijing, relatives of the lost passengers were shown a helpful looking slide on the new search area in the context of various satellite sightings of potential debris. Here's a summary of the main developments: A New Zealand search aircraft has reported spotting objects in a revised search area which has become the new focus of the hunt for the wreckage of MH370. The Australian Maritime and Safety Authority said it was awaiting images from the Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion, which was on its way back to base. The objects are unlikely to be relocated by ship until Saturday. The search zone has shifted almost 700 miles closer to Australia after investigators calculated the plane was going faster and using more fuel when it disappeared than previously thought. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the analysis was based on the plane's final radar contacts and suggested the plane would have burned more fuel in the opening stages of its flight. It is unclear whether potential debris spotted by satellite images earlier this week hundreds of miles further south-west, could have drifted from the revised assumed crash site. Malaysia said ocean drift meant the satellite could be consistent with the new area, but Australia played down the satellite sightings, saying the search had \"moved-on\". The UK's Air Accident Investigation's Board, which helped Malaysia to calculate that MH370 had crashed into the Indian Ocean, has defended its decision not to brief Chinese relatives about its calculations. A spokesman for the AAIB said it was Malaysia was leading the investigation so it was right its officials briefed the relatives. Angry relatives of the lost passengers have staged another protest at Malaysia by staging a walk out of a briefing by Malaysian officials in Beijing. The walkout comes three days after relatives marched on the Malaysian embassy in Beijing demanding answers about the missing plane. Malaysia Airlines has pledged to fly relatives of the missing passengers to Perth if wreckage is found. It said the \"the well-being and feelings of family members are and have always been close to our hearts and minds\". An oceanographer has challenged Malaysia's claim that the revised search area could be consistent with satellite sightings hundreds of miles south-west, according to ABC's David Wright. Malaysia said the objects spotted by satellite earlier this week could have drifted south west. But Australia said any wreckage is likely to have drifted east. There are as yet no more details on that tantalising update on the sighting of objects by a New Zealand search plane in the new search zone. Just to repeat the objects have yet to be identified and are unlikely to be relocated by ship until Saturday. The Australian Maritime and Safety Authority said it was awaiting images from the Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion, which was on its way back to base. Another New Zealand Orion air crew has just returned home, according to the Facebook page of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. A New Zealand search aircraft reports spotting objects in the revised search area, according to the Twitter feed of the Australian Maritime and Safety Authority. It is awaiting images of the sighting. Confirmation of the sighting by ship is not expected until Saturday, it added. Australia and Malaysia are giving out slightly different signals about how the revised search area relates to potential debris spotted hundreds of miles further south-west in satellite images earlier this week. At the press conference by the Malaysian authorities, which has just ended, acting transport minister Hishammuddin said: Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week. But earlier John Young, general manager of Australian Maritime and Safety Authority played down the significance of the satellite images and said the search had \"moved on\" from where those objects were detected (see earlier). Asked to say which way the debris was likely to have drifted, Young said he thought it would have drifted east from the assumed crash sight. But he told reporters that he would check. Here's the full text of the opening statement to today's media briefing by Malaysia's acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein: Introductory statement Today, the search for MH370 has been further refined. The international investigation team continue working to narrow the search area, and shed further light on MH370\u2019s flight path. We are, as always, grateful for the continuing co-operation of our partners in this difficult and intensive search. Whilst search operations are on-going, we continue to focus our efforts on caring for the families. In Cabinet this morning, we discussed the importance of continuing to support the relatives of the passengers and crew. Refined search area On Monday, the Prime Minister announced that based on new data analysis, Inmarsat and the AAIB had concluded that MH370 flew along the southern corridor, and that its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth. On Tuesday, I confirmed that further study of this data would be undertaken to attempt to determine the final position of the aircraft. The Malaysian investigation team set up an international working group, comprising agencies with expertise in satellite communications and aircraft performance, to take this work forward. The international working group included representatives from the UK, namely Inmarsat, AAIB, and Rolls Royce; from China, namely the CAAC and AAID; from the US, namely the NTSB, FAA, and Boeing; as well as the relevant Malaysian authorities. The group has been working to refine the Inmarsat data, and to analyse it \u2013 together with other information, including radar data and aircraft performance assumptions \u2013 to narrow the search area. Information which had already been examined by the investigation was re-examined in light of new evidence drawn from the Inmarsat data analysis. In addition, international partners \u2013 who continue to process data in their home countries, as well as in the international working group \u2013 have further refined existing data. They have also come up with new technical information, for example on aircraft performance. Yesterday, this process yielded new results, which indicated that MH370 flew at a higher speed than previously thought, which in turn means it used more fuel and could not travel as far. This information was passed to RCC Australia by the NTSB, to help further refine and narrow the search area. The Australian authorities have indicated that they have shifted the search area approximately 1,100 kilometres to the north east. Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week. This work is on-going, and we can expect further refinements. As the Australian authorities indicated this morning, this is standard practice in a search operation. It is a process of continually refining data which in turn further narrows the search area. With each step, we get closer to understanding MH370\u2019s flight path. Searches must be conducted on the best information available at the time. In the search for MH370, we have consistently followed the evidence, and acted on credible leads. Our search and rescue efforts have been directed by verified and corroborated information. This latest refinement of the search area is no different. Satellite images Last night, Japanese authorities announced they had satellite images which showed a number of floating objects approximately 2,500 kilometres southwest of Perth. Early this morning we received separate satellite imagery from the Thai authorities which also showed potential objects. These new satellite images join those released by Australia, China, France, and Malaysia, all of which are with RCC Australia. The range of potential objects, and the difficulty in re-identifying them shows just how complex this investigation is. We remain grateful to all our partners for continuing to assist in the search operations. Concluding remarks The new search area, approximately 1,680 kilometres west of Perth, remains in the Australian area of responsibility. Australia continues to lead the search efforts in this new area, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority gave a comprehensive operational update earlier today. As more information emerges, they will be issuing frequent operational updates, including on assets deployed. I would like to echo their statements that the new search area, although more focused than before, remains considerable; and that the search conditions, although easier than before, remain challenging. For the families of those on board, we pray that further processing of data, and further progress in the search itself, brings us closer to finding MH370. Here's a graphic of the revised search area showing it in relation to the size of the UK. At their daily media briefing in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysia authorities confirmed that objects sighted by satellites as floating in the Indian Ocean have not been identified as related to MH370. But they claimed the revised search area was still consistent with those satellite sightings, due to powerful ocean drifts. It is unclear how the satellite sightings of potential debris fields hundreds of miles south-west relate to the revised search areas. French satellite images detected 122 objects on Sunday in an area roughly 154 square miles, 1588 miles west of Perth. On Thursday Thailand released images, taken on Monday, showing 300 objects in an area 1,680 miles south-west of Perth. John Young, head of the Australian Maritime and Safety Authority, played down those satellite sightings. Asked whether the potential debris fields could have drifted south-west from where the plane is now assumed to have crashed, Young said he would not use the term \"debris field\" in association with the satellite imagery. He said: \"The [satellite] imagery see lots of objects out of the ocean that may or may not actually be objects [related to MH370].\" He added that the searched had \"moved on from those search areas\" where satellite detected those objects. The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, which helped Malaysia to calculate the MH370 had crashed into the Indian Ocean, has defended its decision not to brief Chinese relatives about its calculation. On Wednesday Malaysian official told a briefing to relatives that the UK experts had been invited to attend the briefing but refused. The relatives were scathing about the British calculations. One said: \"You have paid all this money for a rubbish report, and they are pulling a fast one on you!\" Asked to comment on the Malaysian official's claim that it had refused to attend the briefing an AAIB spokesman gave this statement to the Guardian: This is not the AAIB\u2019s investigation. The AAIB, working as part of an international team, continues to give its full support to the investigation and to share its expertise and analysis with Malaysian authorities. Given that the Malaysians are leading the investigation, it is entirely right that they also lead in communicating developments with the families, the media and the wider public. Angry relatives of the lost passengers have staged another protest at Malaysia by staging a walk out of briefing by Malaysian officials in Beijing. The walkout reported by the Straits Times comes three days after relatives marched on the Malaysian embassy in Beijing demanding answers about the missing plane. The new revised location for MH370 is said to be the most \"credible\" lead about the plane's whereabouts, since the last most \"credible\" lead showed what was thought to be a debris field hundreds of miles to the south-west. Explaining the new calculations Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transportation Safety Bureau, said: It is an iterative process and is being refined over time but what we have at the moment is the most credible location of the entry to the water and therefore the place to search. The announcement comes two days after the Malaysian authorities released French satellite images showing 122 objects in the old search zone, further south-west. At the time Malaysia's acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, used similar language to describe that apparent breakthrough. \"This is is still the most credible lead we have,\" he said. The Malaysian authorities are due to give another daily news briefing at 09.30GMT. Welcome to our live coverage of the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 after the hunt for the wreckage took another twist almost three weeks after the plane went missing. Here's a summary of the latest developments: The search for MH370 has shifted almost 700 miles closer to Australia after investigators calculated the plane was going faster and using more fuel when it disappeared than previously thought. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the analysis was based on the plane's final radar contacts and suggested the plane would have burned more fuel in the opening stages of its flight. China's largest rescue ship the Haixun 01 has arrived at the new search area, about 1,150 miles west of Perth. Five other ships are in the area including Australia's HMAS Success. Malaysia Airlines has pledged to fly relatives of the missing passengers to Perth if wreckage is found. It said the \"the well-being and feelings of family members are and have always been close to our hearts and minds\". Underwater scanners that will be used to try to locate the black box flight recorders from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have arrived at the search headquarters in Australia, as crews pin their hopes on new satellite images showing 300 pieces of possible debris in the southern Indian Ocean. An Australian naval vessel ship will sweep the seabed by towing an underwater listening device deep below the surface in the hope of picking up an ultrasonic signal from one or both of the plane's black box recorders, while a small submersible drone will be used to scan the sea floor for signs of wreckage. Inmarsat, the British satellite company which calculated that the plane crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, has been defending its decision not to give details about its calculations. In an interview with Guardian, chief executive Rupert Pearce said: \"The blogosphere is full of rumours, innuendo, supposition that will take the slightest bit of information and turn it into conjecture. I can only imagine how wounding and damaging and chaotic that is to those people who have potentially lost loved ones. So we are trying to restrict our information to channelling it through the investigation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
