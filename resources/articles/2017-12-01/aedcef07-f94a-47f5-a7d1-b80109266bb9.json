The Arsenal midfielder, in impressive form since his return from a cracked fibula in his left leg, is coming towards the end of his contract and is still waiting to start talks with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger about what lies ahead. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m at home maybe you think: \u2018What\u2019s going to happen? I\u2019ve only got six months left,\u2019\u201d the 25-year-old says. But all that evaporates as soon as he gets anywhere near a ball, such is his drive to get back to his best on the pitch. \u201cNothing goes through your head when you\u2019re playing except who you are playing against and what you can do to affect the game. If I\u2019m on the bench in a Premier League game, I\u2019m thinking: \u2018What can I do coming off the bench?\u2019 Once I\u2019m at the training ground, I\u2019m focused, preparing for the next game.\u201d Patience and maturity may not be qualities readily associated with Wilshere, who in his youth had an exuberant streak that sometimes tipped over the line. But this past week\u2019s headlines over an ice-skating trip with his family should have been interpreted as him just being a good dad, and he has shown thoughtful and careful resolve since he returned to Arsenal after a year-long loan at Bournemouth was cut short by serious injury. Wilshere has been quietly determined, keeping his head down even as he feels chances remain hard to come by. \u201cIt\u2019s not just now I want to play \u2013 I have been wanting to play for ages. I have spoken to the manager and he knows I want to play in the Premier League. I also have to respect that the team has been playing well. I know we lost last weekend but before that, we were on a good run. It is a difficult team to get into. All I can do when I get an opportunity is play as well as I can and show the boss what I can do.\u201d Wilshere has tried to adapt, to listen to his body more, and to maintain strong fitness. \u201cI know my body a little bit better,\u201d he says. \u201cThere might be some days when I have had to miss a training session and the boss has been brilliant. I have trained 90% of the time. But on the odd occasion when I am feeling a bit tired and know my body is at risk of picking up an injury I speak with the boss and he lets me stay inside. As I\u2019ve got older I\u2019ve got a bit wiser and learned you can\u2019t go out there every day and \u2013 you have to pick your time. You have to be fresh for the game and that is what I have been concentrating on more this year.\u201d Wilshere, who is likely to be on the bench again at Southampton on Sunday, is pressing hard to replace Granit Xhaka in Wenger\u2019s favoured Premier League lineup. Most of his appearances have been in the Europa League or as a substitute in the Premier League but, given the quality of his performances, his mix of drive and vision offers something different. His desire to return to the starting XI in the Premier League is twofold: to push on with England as well as Arsenal. \u201cOf course, I want to play for my country,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t for a while. The manager seems to not favour me, if you like, in that he hasn\u2019t picked me recently. He picked me once and since then I\u2019ve not been in. He said he wants me to be playing regularly in the Premier League and, fair enough, that\u2019s what I have to do. I have been playing in the Europa League and I\u2019ve felt I\u2019ve done well. If that\u2019s not enough then I\u2019ve got to get into the Premier League team. Until I do that I\u2019m not going to be in his plans. I accept that, and I will try and work hard to get into the Premier League team, and ultimately into the England team.\u201d His faith in himself keeps him optimistic: \u201cOf course, I think I\u2019m good enough. I felt that even when I was a 16-year-old and I was with players here who were international players, and I believed I was good enough to be in the team. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, then who is going to believe in you? If the opportunity comes this weekend, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
