Construction work on the \u00a315bn London line, which will stretch 73 miles from Maidenhead in Berkshire to Shenfield in Essex, via the city centre, is well advanced and due to be finished in 2018. Crossrail boasts that its eight new stations in central London \u2013 by architects including Norman Foster \u2013 will feature \"world-class design\", building on a legacy stretching back to Charles Holden's prewar tube stations and Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Victorian masterpieces, such as London's Paddington. But Rogers lamented a decision by those managing Crossrail not to apply such standards to more than two dozen surface stations outside the city centre. Since 2009, Crossrail has employed an expert \"design review\" panel set up by building watchdog the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) to scrutinise plans for the central London stations. However, Rogers said the same rigour was not being applied to the 27 redeveloped stations elsewhere on the line, including Ealing Broadway, where initial drawings suggest the station will be quite stark in design. \"These stations should be treated in the same way as the early tube stations,\" Rogers told Building magazine. \"These are important public buildings which millions will travel through. There has to be somebody who knows something about design looking at this. This is serious, because it [poor design] could scar a community that uses a station for a century or so. Of all the things that have influenced me, the greatest are the Victorian railway stations.\" Rogers, 80, whose work on the Urban Task Force in the late 1990s led to the establishment of Cabe, also sits in the Lords as a Labour peer and is vowing to lobby the government over the issue. London mayor Boris Johnson is also under pressure to intervene, particularly because of his championing of the suburbs and comments on the \"great importance\" of design quality on Crossrail. Dame Tessa Jowell, the former Olympics minister, has described Crossrail's decision not to continue with the Cabe panel as \"discrimination\" and is pledging to write to the mayor and raise the matter in the Commons with the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin. She said: \"Cabe's design review panel, which of course oversaw design throughout the Olympics, was an excellent innovation which recognised that good design needn't cost more and can create glorious public spaces while enhancing safety, utility and aesthetic. What is disturbing about this [decision] is that it creates an outer- versus inner-London discrimination. It could mean that the regeneration potential of London's outer Crossrail stations, may be lost to 'flat-pack' design.\" Council bosses along the route are also calling for the designs to be overseen independently, not least because Crossrail and its partner Network Rail are said to be so focused on cost-cutting or \"value-engineering\". Mark Lucas, head of planning and regeneration at the London Borough of Redbridge, which will have four Crossrail stations, said it was \"very concerning\" that such developments would not be independently design reviewed. \"There is still time, but the door is closing. We're in the last chance saloon. The last time stations on this branch of the tracks were created was in 1839, when the Victorians built them. It seems to me that when you're talking about something which should be lasting a century-and-a-half, we really should be applying the greatest possible design scrutiny. The Ilford station upgrade will cost \u00a36m \u2013 a fraction of what the central London stations cost \u2013 and has already been the subject of an internal Network Rail value-engineering exercise.\" A spokesman for the Cabe panel \u2013 which is now part of the Design Council \u2013 said it \"would welcome the opportunity to be involved in the planning of the remaining stations\". A spokesman for Crossrail said: \"A huge amount of time, effort and planning is going into delivering surface station enhancements. We believe that these improvements can be satisfactorily designed and delivered by working directly with local authorities.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
