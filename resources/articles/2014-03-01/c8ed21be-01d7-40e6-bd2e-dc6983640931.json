Instead of leading the Ireland attack in Bangladesh in their first match at the World Twenty20 qualifying tournament against Zimbabwe, the gentle giant from rural Ulster is in Barbados on Warwickshire's pre-season tour. There are worse places to be but Rankin's decision to follow the trail blazed by Ed Joyce and Eoin Morgan has not so far been a raging success. The 29-year-old admitted his Test debut at Sydney in January \"couldn't have been much worse\" after he suffered a back spasm on the eve of the game and was afflicted by nerves and cramp during it. He only made a couple of appearances in the one-day maulings that followed and some have already written off his England career after he was omitted from their World T20 squad. That seems premature \u2013 he made a much more positive impression in England's home one-day series against Australia last summer, and Ashley Giles, who remains in the box seat to succeed Andy Flower as head coach in all forms of the game, is a big fan after working closely with him at Warwickshire. But it does raise the question of whether Rankin would be happier reuniting with the Ireland squad, with whom he has enjoyed a fair few golden moments over the last decade \u2013 most obviously the famous win against England in the 2011 World Cup, but also at the World T20 in England the previous year when a victory against Bangladesh took them into the second phase. \"Of course it's fair to say that we had a number of conversations with Boyd to set out the risks of the path he chose at the time,\" said Warren Deutrom, the chief executive of Cricket Ireland, before he left for Bangladesh at the weekend. \"But in saying that we recognise that it's a short career and players have to maximise their earning potential. The focus for us has to be making sure that Boyd is the last Irish cricketer to play for England.\" Ireland received a major boost in relation to that when the controversial recent reforms of the International Cricket Council included the introduction of a structured pathway to Test cricket, which has long been their stated goal. \"Previously the route map was fairly nebulous, but the proposals put forward by England, India and Australia have created a road map that previously didn't exist,\" Deutrom added. If Ireland win the next Intercontinental Cup contested by associate and affiliate ICC nations \u2013 and as Deutrom points out, they have won four of the last five \u2013 they will earn a play-off against the team at the bottom of the World Test rankings, probably in 2018, in which victory could secure full Test status. Giles Clarke, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, has already expressed enthusiasm, and cleared space in England's future tours programme, to host Ireland at Lord's for their inaugural Test in 2019. Until then competitions such as the World T20 offer the grandest stage to the talented and increasingly experienced squad available to the coach Phil Simmons, captained by Rankin's Warwickshire team-mate Will Porterfield and including Surrey's Gary Wilson, Somerset's George Dockrell, Tim Murtagh and Paul Stirling of Middlesex, and Joyce \u2013 who returned to the Ireland fold in the 2011 World Cup after playing for England in the previous tournament four years earlier. Joyce had to serve a four-year qualification period and as things stand Rankin would have to wait two years before being allowed to play for Ireland again, although Deutrom has heard rumblings from the ICC that he may yet be allowed to return for the 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year. Ireland remain a competitive team without him, however, as they showed by shocking a strong West Indies side in Jamaica last month, and will be confident of beating Zimbabwe, the Netherlands and the UAE in the weaker of the two qualifying groups \u2013 the other includes Bangladesh and Afghanistan \u2013 to secure a place in the tournament proper, and another crack at England in Chittagong the Monday after next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
