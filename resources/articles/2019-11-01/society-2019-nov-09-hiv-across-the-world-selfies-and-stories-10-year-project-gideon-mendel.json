Over 10 years, more than 130 HIV-positive people across five continents have taken part, many of whom picked up cameras for the first time in their lives. Here they tell their stories, in words and in photographs. \u2018My years with HIV have taught me to be more humble\u2019 Alejandro, Mexico City, Mexico I have been living with HIV for 15 years. The afternoon I got the news, I was in shock. I left the doctor\u2019s office and wandered aimlessly in the streets, all night long. When I finally came to my senses, it was dawn. I decided to fight to remain in the best physical, emotional and psychological condition I could, during the time I had left. I promised myself that the virus would never defeat me. I decided to be tough. It doesn\u2019t matter if the virus came in to my life, or if I went looking for it. I am an electrician, and I live like anybody else. I love to exercise, not only because it is good for me, but also because I always wanted to have the body of a wrestler. The years I have spent living with HIV have taught me to be more humble, respectful and humane. My greatest satisfaction now is to help other people get medical care. We who live with HIV do not ask for special privileges, only that our rights be respected. \u2018The medication has changed my body: I look like a monster\u2019 Aoy, Bangkok, Thailand I became infected with HIV 10 years ago, when I was 30, from sex with my boyfriend. I was shocked and worried that people would judge me. But then I met a group of new friends living with HIV. I realised people with HIV can live for many years. And I thought, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I stay alive, too?\u201d I take my medicine and care for myself, both body and soul. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. I wish there were a cure, so that I didn\u2019t have to take my medication. Each medicine has a different side-effect. My body has changed. I do exercises to help get a better shape, to help reduce my lipodystrophy: body bulge is a common side-effect. I feel I look like a monster. I have a hump on my back, and a distended tummy. If we don\u2019t want people to stamp HIV on our foreheads, then we have to take better care of our appearance. Even though I\u2019m HIV positive, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about my personal beauty. I don\u2019t want society to see HIV as something pathetic. I don\u2019t want people to feel sorry for me. \u2018I used to believe HIV would prevent me from being loved\u2019 James, London, England In the early days of my diagnosis, I was afraid of transmitting the virus to partners. Sex was overshadowed by risk, the body a vessel for fear rather than joy. I am interested in depicting the body within a fledgling relationship, and what that means in the context of HIV; David, my partner in this picture, is not HIV positive. I want to represent my HIV within a broader context of human intimacy, as healthy, erotic and sensual, as playful and loving, as sacred and nurturing, because I am all of those things. I have a lot of tattoos. Some allude, metaphorically, to my journey with HIV. A man struck up a conversation in the changing room of my gym, asking me why so many of my tattoos reference the spiritual. And it dawned on me that the most common theme written across my body is my divine connection to love. Once upon a time, I believed HIV would prevent me from loving and being loved. This photo captures a brief moment when the divine nature of love blossomed between me and David. \u2018My children know I have HIV. My neighbours think it is tuberculosis\u2019 Sudesh, Mumbai, India In 2005, my wife died \u2013 of non-Aids-related causes \u2013 and I thought, \u201cWhat have I got in life other than misfortune?\u201d I distanced myself from everyone and was very worried that my children did not have a mother. I wondered how I would look after them, but realised I had to. In 2008, I was becoming thinner and weighed just 32kg [5st]. I suspected that there was something wrong, so I got my blood tested. The doctor said I had HIV. I don\u2019t know how I got it. I suspect it was via a doctor\u2019s contaminated injection needle. From 2004 to 2007, I spent most of my money on treatment. After selling my house, my money ran out. I had to tell the doctor that paying for medicine was difficult. He gave me a month\u2019s worth: I could not believe his kindness. That is how my life has been \u2013 spending all my money on medicine, taking pills and raising my children. I take care of the home and if I get time, do a little business. I buy and sell kerosene. I have not been ill in eight years and my weight is up to 55kg [8st 9lb], but I do not work. People help our family. We have a place to live, which my father built. My children know I have HIV. My daughter told me everyone takes medicine, and it is OK if I do. As for the people around me, I have not said anything to them. They think I have tuberculosis. My children are happy now. I got three of my daughters married, which is one stressful thing achieved. My son is in his last year of school, and in two to three years he will stand on his own feet. Meanwhile, I am alone. I don\u2019t have a partner. I fold my hands and accept this. This is my life, and my life will go on. \u2018I prayed for a girl: she is happy, healthy, HIV negative\u2019 Lynnea, Los Angeles, US When you\u2019re a person living with HIV, you need your friends \u2013 to get past the stigma and to share moments of genuine love. I think I was born with HIV. My mother has it, and one of the ways it can be passed on is from mother to child in the womb. Often people give me more sympathy than they give someone who contracted HIV through drug use or sex. They say it\u2019s not my fault and I didn\u2019t ask for it. But who asks for HIV? The only difference between me and other HIV-positive people is that I don\u2019t know life without it. I grew up thinking it was impossible for me to have a child. I failed to plan for my future because I couldn\u2019t imagine having one. As an adult, I began hearing about a decrease in mother-to-child HIV transmission, using a new treatment regimen. After consulting with my doctor, I made the decision to try [for a baby]. HIV is no longer terminal. It\u2019s a chronic treatable disease, like diabetes. So my doctor gave me the green light. In the past, doctors preferred a caesarean birth, to minimise blood sharing, but, following medical advice, I was able to have a natural birth. I wanted my child to have the best possible outcome, and that\u2019s how it turned out. I had prayed for a girl, and the ultrasound confirmed it. She would be the remixed version of myself, so I scrambled the letters of my own name, Lynnea, and created the most beautiful name I could imagine: Nae\u2019Lyn. Nae\u2019Lyn is my life. She\u2019s a happy, healthy, HIV-negative little girl. She\u2019s sassy, spunky and very opinionated. She sings in church. She remembers everything. She is the sweetest little girl I\u2019ve ever met. And here I am, looking forward to being an old woman, decades from now. \u2018I felt trapped in sex work. But the moment I found out I was pregnant, I stopped\u2019 Wideline, Port-au-Prince, Haiti I started sex work when I was 16. I felt trapped. It was hard, but I got used to the job. Sometimes clients get mad, but the boss would never let anyone hit you. If they are with you for a minute, they pay $10. From the moment I discovered I was pregnant, I stopped doing it. I found out I had HIV in January 2014. At first, I felt confused, because I had done a test that came out negative, then went back again and the test came back positive. Some people living with HIV feel isolated, but I see the world the same way I saw it before. My friends help me, and my boyfriend is there, too. I go to the hospital every month; they give me [HIV] medication, and other medication because I am pregnant. They say that if I take all the medicine, the baby has a big chance of not having HIV. When she grows up, I hope she will not do the same work I did. \u2018When I told my mother, she said: \u201cYou are positive? So what?\u201d\u2019 Bhekisisa, Johannesburg, South Africa When they told me that I was positive, I was not shocked. I knew my behaviour had been bad. I had many girlfriends. I was a playboy \u2013 you can see how handsome I am. But I was destroying my life. So I told myself it was time for me to change. I really wanted to live. I really love life. The same day I found out my HIV status, I went to my mother\u2019s house and told her. She didn\u2019t want to show me that she was sad, so she said, \u201cYou are positive? So what?\u201d I realised she was trying to tell me I didn\u2019t have to give up. So I started to think positively, to take medication, and pick up my life. I\u2019ve got two children in my current relationship, and I\u2019m living with three others. Their mothers just said, \u201cYou know what? Take care of these children.\u201d I\u2019m so happy that they are part of my life. My father didn\u2019t take care of me because of his many wives. I realise I used to be like him. Then I saw that it was important to change my life, to think positively, to rectify all the mistakes I had made. I always want to be happy, because it motivates me and makes me strong. When I become sad, I can feel it in my body \u2013 it\u2019s not good for me. \u2022 This is an edited extract from Through Positive Eyes, edited by Gideon Mendel and David Gere, published on 1 December (Aperture, \u00a322), throughpositiveeyes.org.
