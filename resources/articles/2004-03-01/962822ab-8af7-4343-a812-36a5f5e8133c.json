A representatives of the attorney general will still have to appear in court tomorrow, however, to oppose an application for Lord Goldsmith to be summoned as a witness. The judgment came as MPs debated a motion calling on the government to publish the attorney general's advice. Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party (SNP) have joined forces to demand its release. Tim Owen QC was defending 14 peace protestors charged with aggravated trespass after they allegedly entered Marchwood military base, near Southampton. He told Southampton magistrates' court this morning that disclosure of Lord Goldsmith's advice was \"critical\" for their defence of necessity, as the 14 claim to have been acting to prevent the loss of life through an illegal war. Mr Owen said the \"minor disruption\" was \"a last-ditch attempt to bring public attention to the fact that arms that might be used in an unlawful war were being loaded onto tanks\". GCHQ whistleblower Katherine Gun was freed amid speculation that the government was unwilling to publish Lord Goldsmith's advice after her lawyers used a similar defence. District judge John Woollard ruled, however, that it was not in his power to force the Crown Prosecution Service to disclose the legal advice. He told the court that it was clear that it was not \"material which an officer investigating the case would reasonably be expected to consider related to the prosecution of the charges which these defendants face\". \"I therefore do not consider this material to be prosecution material,\" he added. \"I therefore have no power to enforce disclosure under this section.\" In the Commons, meanwhile, MPs were debating a Plaid Cymru and the SNP motion calling for Lord Goldsmith's advice to be \"published in full\". Responding for the government, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said: \"Whatever our different positions on the justification for military action, our focus now should be on supporting the Iraqi people and all those who are working with them as they build a free, safe and prosperous Iraq at peace with its neighbours and taking its rightful place in the international community.\" The foreign secretary said he \"respected\" arguments over the legality of the military action. But he \"rejected the insinuation ... that the attorney general and Ministers reflecting his view have not been straightforward with the house about the nature of the legal advice which he gave or that we received\". And he accused the Tories of opportunism in backing the calls for the advice to be disclosed. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Elfyn Llwyd, opened the debate by rejecting the government's claim to be acting on \"long-standing convention\" in withholding the full advice. He said the legal advice given to previous administrations had been released in exceptional circumstances - such as the arms to Iraq affair. He went on to say there was no difference in principle between publishing part of the advice - which has already been done - and publishing it all. Mr Llwyd told MPs that both Mr Straw and Tony Blair had accepted that there was a \"legitimate debate\" over whether the war was right. In that case, he argued, MPs - who were asked to approve the military action - should be given all the information needed to have such a debate. \"Part of the functions of the ministers of the Crown is to fully inform the debate and fully appraise parliament of all facts germane to the issue. \"That, I believe, is beyond contradiction,\" he said. The issue went to the heart of the government's fears about losing public trust, he added. \"How can they expect to build up that relationship when they behave in this way? How is a member of the public expected to engage if he or she is not allowed to see what is truly going on?\" he asked. The MP questioned whether the information given to the attorney general was correct - sparking doubts about the entire legitimacy of advice based on it. If he was making his decisions based on items such as the claim Saddam's weapons could be ready in 45 minutes or the idea that previous UN resolutions still applied then the advice could be \"flawed\", he said. Why had France, Germany and Russia all believed that military action could not be engaged legally without a second UN resolution, he asked. \"Such mass misunderstanding is a little rare in international diplomacy.\" He said he was not asking MPs to vote on whether they felt the war was right but simply on whether the advice should be released. \"Those who believe in informed democratic debate, in the freedom of information and in transparency in government should have no problem in joining us in the lobbies this evening.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
