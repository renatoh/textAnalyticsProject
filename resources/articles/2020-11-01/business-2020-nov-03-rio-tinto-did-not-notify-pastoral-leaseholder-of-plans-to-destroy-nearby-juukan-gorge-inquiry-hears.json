The owner of the Cheela Plains pastoral lease, which covers half a million hectares of land bordering Rio Tinto\u2019s Brockman 4 mine, said he was surprised the site was destroyed because it had been known since 2014 it was significant. \u201cDealings with Rio Tinto since the 1970s have been very poor,\u201d Evan Pensini told the inquiry at public hearings in Karratha on Monday. \u201cIn 2006 [when the mine expansion was granted Western Australian government approval] at no point were we notified. Between 2008 and 2010, we tried to find out what Rio Tinto\u2019s intentions were for the mine and pastoral lease.\u201d In 2011, Pensini said his lawyer had to use freedom of information legislation to access documents about the mine, \u201cbecause Rio Tinto would not come forward\u201d. \u201cPrior to us really taking a tough stance in 2011, Rio Tinto didn\u2019t want to tell us anything about the mine,\u201d he said. Since 2017, Pensini said the relationship had improved with middle management at Rio Tinto, but the right balance is yet to be struck between resource extraction and the natural landscape. \u201cThe area in question around the mine is a part of the country that has been special to me since I was young,\u201d Pensini said. \u201cWe have our goals as pastoralists to look after the land, to pass it on to future generations in better shape than we found it. That has been our goal since the 1970s, so our bond and respect for the land is great. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen \u2026 is the mineral resources are the target and the natural aspect of the land is something that\u2019s forgotten,\u201d he said. \u201cOur preservation of the pastoral lease is under threat.\u201d Pensini said he had known about the significance of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge since heritage surveys \u2013 paid for by Rio Tinto \u2013 were done in 2014. He said he assumed that Rio Tinto knew as well. \u201cThey just gave us a footprint map that said where [the pit] was going to be. I knew the shelters were in the vicinity, I just presumed there was no way they\u2019d mine over the top of them,\u201d he said. Inquiry chairman Warren Enstch asked: \u201cSo you\u2019d really have to be from another planet not to know there was something there?\u201d \u201cCorrect,\u201d Pensini said. He said the Cheela Plains pastoral lease is \u201cliterally covered in exploration leases, mining leases or special purpose leases, from small prospectors to large mining companies, so we will get notification of prospecting, surveys, drilling, whatever sent through the mail, then are given a time period to object or ask for more info\u201d. \u201cWe physically cannot stop anything unless it is destroying part of our infrastructure. Apart from that we don\u2019t have any control.\u201d Robe River Kuruma Aboriginal Corporation CEO Sarah Slattery told the inquiry that they spend the majority of their time and resources dealing with dozens of mining company requests at once in an unequal relationship and under existing heritage legislation, \u201cwe can never say no\u201d. \u201cI would say we don\u2019t make much money at all out of mining,\u201d Slattery said, adding that it was a misconception that Aboriginal people have grown \u201crich\u201d from royalties. The cumulative impact of mining is hard to manage, she said. \u201cNot only Rio, we have everybody else out on country,\u201d Slattery said. \u201cAnd we are worried about what will be left for our children and grandchildren; there will be nothing left for them.\u201d Earlier in the day, the committee spoke in private with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners of Juukan Gorge for several hours, before holding public meetings in the afternoon. It is their first opportunity to travel to the Pilbara since Covid-19 border restrictions were put in place. The committee will travel to Juukan Gorge on Tuesday to see the site for themselves. The parliamentary inquiry was set up after Rio Tinto destroyed the 46,000-year-old Aboriginal sacred site in the Pilbara in May. The committee is looking into how the destruction came about, the processes that failed to protect the site, and the legislative changes required to prevent it happening again. Enstch said an interim report will be released in December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
