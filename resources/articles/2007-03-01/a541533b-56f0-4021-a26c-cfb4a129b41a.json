In order to copy a DVD there is no necessity to decrypt the contents, as a bit-for-bit copy will be identical to the original and therefore playable on the same equipment and producing the same output (Hollywood faces up to DRM flop, February 22). The real intention of these technologies is to restrict the equipment on which DVDs can be played, to allow the publishers to maximise revenues by preventing free trading of DVDs between countries, and to enhance the position of those equipment manufacturers and software producers who are willing to cooperate. Jeff Taylor Hassocks, West Sussex \u00b7 Hollywood should understand that it's pointless to keep throwing resources at DRM and copy-protection technology, because it simply doesn't work. It will be interesting to see how AACS and the movie studios respond: breaking current players' compatibility with new movies would certainly undermine the claim that DRM makes things better for consumers. kizo.com \u00b7 It might even be that we get something analogous to Moore's Law for breaking encryption: the ongoing expansion of computing into our daily lives can only mean that the cracking of new encryption formats gets quicker and quicker. inmyhumbleetc.co.uk Snipping Snap Haha, awesome! Thanks for telling me how to get rid of those hateful popups!

Paul Kimelman Walnut Creek, California \u00b7 Hundreds of thousands of sites use the Snap Preview Anywhere service totally voluntarily. Anyone - site or user - can easily turn this service off. There have indeed been a few dozen blog posts criticising the service - some vehemently. However, you neglected to mention the hundreds of posts that praise the service for its usefulness and the benefits it provides. The point is that the perceived usefulness of previews is highly dependent on the user and we empower then to adjust or remove the previews. Moreover, your article doesn't mention the constant stream of revisions/improvements/additions we've made to SPA since its initial launch less than three months ago. Snap.com is the fastest growing and largest Web 2.0 search engine. Our technology and approach have been lauded throughout the industry, including being named among Time magazine's 50 coolest web sites.

Totally, dude. vare2yang.spaces.live.com/Blog Digg its grave, please I just wish this wisdom of the crowds/user democracy notion would dry up. (Victor Keegan, February 22). It will only lead to bland, whitewashed sameness-of-thought. All you can get from a crowd, especially an unpaid crowd, is group-think, not innovation; banality, not originality. lagtime.com/cib/ Tune in, switch off I was surprised to read that \"Toshiba doesn't allow users to switch off its televisions\" (Time to switch on energy-saving TVs, February 22). In my house all appliances are connected to the mains via plugs and sockets, and all the sockets are switched. How are they going to prevent me carrying out an action which has positive effects on both safety and the environment?
