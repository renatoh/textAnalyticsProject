Egeli Rasta, a 27-year-old Estonian, was seen leaving her flat in Mitcham on July 4 wearing Lycra running clothes and heading towards Mitcham common. It was the day after she had finished a temporary job as a sales assistant in Harrods. Last night, after an intensive search, police said they had found a body on the common, where Ms Rasta regularly jogged. Officers were unable to say whether it was male or female. The discovery, at 8.30pm, followed a weekend of police activity on the common, with specialist search teams scouring rough ground across the 185 hectare (460 acre) beauty spot, divers searching ponds and 40 detectives conducting interviews. Detective Chief Inspector David Garwood, in charge of the police incident room in Lewisham, south London, said earlier yesterday he was \"pessimistic\" about Ms Rasta's fate. \"We have searched Egeli's flat and everything she would need for day-to-day life is still there, including her make-up, passport and travel documents and bank details. \"We know she had two pairs of trainers and only one pair remains in the flat. We believe she did not return from her jog on the afternoon of Tuesday July 4. There were no signs of disturbance in the flat. She has vanished. We are pessimistic about her prospects. I would love her to turn up but I don't think that's on.\" Police were granted an extra day last night to question a man in his early 20s who was arrested on suspicion of murder on Thursday. Detectives were treating the case as a \"stranger attack\" and said there was no evidence that the suspect had known Ms Rasta previously or that there had been a soured relationship. Police believe Ms Rasta, who has been living in the country for two years, finished her job in Harrods' cosmetics department at 9pm on Monday July 3. She failed to keep an appointment with her employment agency and to meet an Estonian friend at Gatwick airport. Mr Garwood said Ms Rasta had been seeing a man who was involved in another relationship, and that he too had become concerned for her safety. After a few days a group of her friends climbed up a ladder to search her flat and found that only her keys, phone and a pair of trainers appeared to be missing. A towel had been laid out on the bed, as if in preparation for a post-run shower."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
