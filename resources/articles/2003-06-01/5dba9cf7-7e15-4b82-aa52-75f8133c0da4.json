Argos Online. It's just really well designed. The last thing I bought from it was a Breville food processor. But it's an Antony Worrall Thompson one, and the cheese doesn't stick in the grooves. Last online purchase? A thing called a GP32. It's a handheld games console made by a company called Game Park in Korea. It lets you play loads of nerdy old games designed for Ataris and Spectrum. I got it from GBAX.com. Ever been in a chat room? Gawd yes. As a student I went into a chat room pretending to be a lesbian called Rachael, from Wigan. I remember talking about my lustrous hair. Most recent technological faux pas? I keep losing my mobile phone. Basically I go to the pub and it doesn't come back. I haven't changed the ringtone on my new phone because I think if I change it, I'll lose it. It's just a superstition. Main news source on the web? Email - friends sending me links saying \"Look at this!\". It's usually Ananova, or BBC or the Guardian. I subscribe to Jon Snow's Snowmail. I love his anecdotal comments and his occasional references to monkeys. He lives up the road from me and I'm happy he's reading the news. Most useful website? What I quite like doing on Amazon is trawling round and filling my basket with things I'd love to buy. Least useful website? I'm gonna diss Tesco's. I find it unfathomable that it has won awards and makes money. I want to use it, but I click on products and it takes me to a totally random page, so I have taken my custom to my local corner shop. Do you use a screensaver? Yes, it's written by a friend of mine. It takes all the images that appear on the front page of B3ta and puts them in a slide show. At the moment it's synchronised sheep-dipping, a cat in a rabbit suit, a little robot dreaming of a lady robot... Most irritating thing about the internet? Success costing you money. Bandwidths mean you get a bill for the number of people who see it, which is the direct opposite of any other form of media. What type of online business is least likely to succeed? When someone takes a moment's inspiration from their own life and extrapolates it, instead of saying \"I'm going to sell widgets!\" Do you still bother with old media? I read the Camden New Journal, my local free paper. It's like a penny dreadful. And I'm a big fan of Word magazine - it feels rebellious. \u00b7 Rob Manuel is in charge of editorial content for cult online community B3ta.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
