In the world of sustainability alone, we saw the landmark Paris climate change agreement come into force; learned how rising temperatures in the Arctic are negatively impacting local residents; and watched as the world\u2019s top conservationists mourned the declining state of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef. And then, a bombshell: a certain \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d won the US presidential race and called into question everything from America\u2019s basic environmental protection to Nasa\u2019s ongoing climate change research. Corporate America took evasive action, signing a letter telling Donald Trump it is serious about sustainability, while others began unpacking Trump\u2019s emphasis on \u201cclean coal\u201d and what it really means for the future of energy in the US. But it hasn\u2019t all been doom and gloom. While the rest of the world struggled to come to terms with the aforementioned craziness, innovators, scientists and tech heads worked quietly from the sidelines to come up with solutions. And some succeeded: from a trashcan that sucks up ocean garbage to a drone that delivers vaccines to endangered ferrets, here are our top picks for this year\u2019s best sustainable tech. A trashcan for the ocean It\u2019s no secret that our oceans are turning into swirling garbage dumps. There are some 5.25tn pieces of floating plastic debris in the oceans right now, and it\u2019s estimated that some 8m metric tons of plastic waste enter global waters every year. Earlier this year, Peter Ceglinski and Andrew Turton, two surfers from Australia, came up with a device they\u2019re calling the Seabin \u2013 a kind of submersible garbage can that captures floating trash. Picture a cylinder, with the upper opening just below the surface of the water. An electric pump draws water through the bottom of the cylinder, creating a vortex around the upper edge that pulls in water and floating trash. A bag filter, made of natural material, collects the trash and allows water to pass through. After raising more than $267,000 in an Indiegogo campaign to help build the device, Ceglinski and Turton are keen to start selling the Seabin to marinas around the world. First stop: Miami, Florida, where Miami Beach\u2019s marinas manager wants to start using the Seabin in 2017 to counter the bags, bottles, paper plates and forks found daily in the water. A handheld cancer-detecting device Earlier this year, British-based tech firm QuantuMDx developed a new, low-cost diagnostic DNA analyzer the size of a smartphone which is being billed as a \u201chandheld lab\u201d. The device \u2013 called Q-Poc \u2013 can accurately diagnose everything from cancers to infectious diseases in minutes. Although it is currently in alpha testing stage, the company hopes to get the product in the hands of doctors by early 2018. Q-Poc runs on a solar-powered battery and it\u2019s designed to read biological samples submitted via a credit card-size cartridge. It can work with a range of sample types: swabs can be used to detect sexually-transmitted infections, while saliva is used to detect tuberculosis. (Tests for other diseases will be added at a later date.) The device uses mobile technology, enabling the test results to be geo-stamped and shared in real time. The prospect of a speedy diagnosis at a patient\u2019s side is exciting, particularly in countries where access to medical care is a challenge. Subject to regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO), QuantuMDx hopes to initially roll out the Q-Poc unit in South Africa, before expanding to other markets. Stuff you can eat (instead of throwing it away) It was a big year for edible everyday items, like cutlery and beer cans. First up, an Indian cutlery company, Bakeys, invented cutlery that you can eat as a way to tackle plastic waste in oceans and landfill. (Welcome to a new geological epoch of trash \u2013 scientists are calling it the manmade Anthropocene.) Plastic cutlery significantly contributes to this problem \u2013 estimates suggest the US alone uses 40bn plastic utensils a year. Hence the need for edible versions. Bakeys makes vegan-friendly cutlery from rice, wheat and an ancient grain called sorghum, which was picked because it doesn\u2019t go soggy when immersed in liquid. The cutlery comes in three flavors: savory (salt and cumin); sweet (sugar); and plain. And, if you\u2019re wondering \u2013 it kind of tastes like a dry cracker. Why not wash down the cutlery with an edible beer holder? Americans are consuming more beer it seems \u2013 67bn beer cans each year, apparently. According to the Brewers Association, this number is expected to grow significantly as craft breweries get more popular. The problem is that plastic beer can holders pose a threat to fish and marine wildlife when they end up in the ocean. Saltwater Brewery, based in Florida, has come up with a solution: biodegradable, edible beer pack rings made from wheat and barley waste. The rings disintegrate within two hours of being in the ocean, which prevents fish or other sea animals getting stuck. They\u2019re also harmless if ingested by curious fish. More than 50 craft breweries have already contacted Saltwater expressing an interest in using the edible rings. The brewery is now developing metal molds capable of making 400,000 rings per month and hopes to build a centralized production facility by 2017. A drone that helps endangered species One of 2016\u2019s most heartwarming stories revolved around a cunning plan by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to bombard a ferret habitat in Montana with a vaccine administered via specially designed drones that can \u201cshoot\u201d pellets in three directions at the same time. All this in a bid to save the endangered black-footed ferret. The vaccine pellets are actually intended for the prairie dog population inside the habitat at the UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge. The ferrets are dependent upon prairie dogs for food and shelter, but a flea-borne disease called sylvatic plague has slowly been killing the prairie dogs off. The FWS came up with a \u201cglorified gumball machine\u201d to spit out the vaccine pellets. The machine which can be attached to a drone which uses GPS to drop the pellets throughout the habitat. Oh, and if you\u2019re wondering: the FWS said lab tests show that prairie dogs find the bait in the vaccines \u201cdelicious\u201d. Using 3D printers to eliminate plastic waste As we\u2019ve established, humans produce a lot of trash \u2013 apparently of the more than 300m tons of plastic produced globally every year, one refuse truck\u2019s worth ends up in our waters, landfills and streets every minute. One of our favorite stories this year came from India, where a local entrepreneur has set up a production facility at a local rubbish dump, where waste pickers convert high-density polyethylene (HPDE) \u2013 mostly used for plastic bottles \u2013 into 3D printing filament to eventually be sold to 3D printing companies. The market for 3D printing filament \u2013 the majority of which is made from virgin plastic \u2013 is growing rapidly. A recent report predicted the 3D printing materials market will grow by nearly 266% in the next five years. And, while the market for ethical filament is still relatively small, the greatest potential 3D printing seems to be offering the developing world is employment \u2013 there are an estimated 15 million people globally who currently make their living from waste picking, for example."}, "isHosted": false}}}
