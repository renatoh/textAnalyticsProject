That was my first thought on hearing that Joseph Devine, the Bishop of Motherwell, had sent a snotty letter to MSPs as they began to debate the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill last week. He had written complaining about the section of the bill which allows homosexual couples to adopt, calling it 'distressing' and a 'violation of family life'. The bill, it should be made clear, doesn't give gay couples the right to adopt - a court decides suitability as in all cases - but means that both partners in an unmarried couple will have equal rights over an adopted child. As the law stands, gay people can only adopt singly. I felt ashamed of my first thought, first because Devine's comments were so predictable, but also because the Catholic church has been getting too rough a ride of late. All the films, memoirs and court proceedings about the terrible times people had growing up in its care have eclipsed the wonderful work that many have done for those in distress. For every Magdalene Sisters story, there must be a multitude of accounts of young people saved from disaster. The pendulum of public opinion has swung too far. But it was still gratifying when the bill Devine so despises passed the first stage in Parliament by a vote of 103 to eight, routing his boorish view. It now moves into the committee phase where it will be worked over. This is where Devine says he will stage his next assault. The debate revealed the deep convictions of the few. The SNP's Roseanna Cunningham made the most stout attack. 'In my view, parenting is so important that it seems inconceivable that we would introduce yet another potential difficulty into the adoption mix by extending the provision to gay couples,' she said. 'I cannot see how overturning tens of thousands of years of nature's design will move us forward in society.' It's this argument that makes me react uncharitably. No one is trying to overturn nature's design - new life still requires a sperm and an egg - they are trying to overturn society's prejudices. The Catholic church has been more than prepared to have children raised by priests and nuns who forswear all sex. If we are to live by the spirit of Cunningham's phrase, this also overturns 'tens of thousands of years of nature's design'. Children in distress would be lucky to find themselves growing up in most gay households, so let's get to the heart of this argument. 'Don't believe gays should be allowed to adopt,' said one correspondent to the Scotsman's web message board. 'They will end up like them, instead of being normal.' So much for tens of thousands of years of nature's design. Yet Cunningham did make the point that the children's views should be taken into account, even if they are deemed prejudiced. She's right. If kids want to deny themselves a loving home, that has to be respected. Anyway, 103 to eight is a reassuring majority. Of greater concern is the Catholic church. Devine is said to have the support of his fellow bishops, if not his fellow Christians in the reformed churches, who have offered no objections to this part of the bill. This weekend, Devine's colleagues, Cardinal Keith O'Brien and Archbishop Mario Conti, have been marching against the replacement of the Trident nuclear deterrent, a principled cause whatever one might think of it. They carry with them a moral power. This is what Bishop Devine fails to wield, not just because he would deny a child a happy home, but because he is throwing stones from a cathedral built of glass. ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
