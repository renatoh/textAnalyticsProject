In his first public comments on the allegations, he was asked by reporters on Air Force One if he knew about the payment, and Trump said \u201cNo\u201d. When was asked why Cohen made the payment, Trump said: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. You\u2019ll have to ask Michael.\u201d Michael Avenatti, Daniels\u2019 attorney, responded on Twitter by claiming the president\u2019s comments had strengthened their case because \u201cyou can\u2019t have an agreement when one party claims to know nothing about it\u201d. Trump, along with Cohen, is currently in litigation with Daniels over a non-disclosure agreement that she signed in exchange for the payment in 2016. Daniels has insisted that the agreement is not valid because Trump never signed it. Earlier this week, Trump\u2019s attorney filed a motion seeking to move the case out of a courtroom into private arbitration. Daniels has claimed that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and that she was threatened when she first pondered going public about her relationship with him in 2011. The White House has repeatedly questioned her credibility. Earlier in March, the White House spokesman, Raj Shah, told reporters: \u201cWith respect to that interview, I will say the president strongly, clearly, has consistently denied these underlying claims. The only person who\u2019s been inconsistent is the one making the claims.\u201d The relationship between Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, and Trump was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in January. Shortly afterwards, In Touch magazine published a 2011 interview with Daniels where she described her sexual encounter with Trump as well as his apparent fascination with sharks. Daniels is one of two women to come forward with allegations of a consensual extramarital affair with Trump. In March, former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that she had a nearly year-long relationship with Trump. Further, Trump faced nearly 20 allegations of sexual misconduct during his 2016 presidential campaign as well as the release of an audio tape where he bragged about groping women without their consent. Trump maintained that all of his accusers were liars and said he would sue them after the campaign. He has yet to do so. One of them, Summer Zervos, is currently suing Trump for defamation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
