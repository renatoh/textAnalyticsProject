Lady Warsi responded furiously to Hancock, the health secretary, after his comments on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme while addressing the Conservative party\u2019s decision not to hold an inquiry into Islamophobia. Challenged on Warsi\u2019s strident criticism of her own party\u2019s record on discrimination against Muslims, Hancock had said: \u201cWell look, I like Sayeeda. She has a particular view on this, there are others who take a more balanced approach.\u201d Asked if he was saying she was \u201cunbalanced\u201d, Hancock replied: \u201cNo, I\u2019m certainly not saying that. I have an enormous amount of respect for Sayeeda but she does take a particular view.\u201d Hours later, Warsi tweeted: A former minister and Tory party chair, Warsi has been a vocal critic of the party\u2019s approach on tackling cases of Islamophobia. On Friday, after Boris Johnson confirmed there would be no inquiry into Islamphobia before Christmas, she wrote on Twitter: \u201cYes disappointing. Yes predictable. Yes it\u2019s true my party don\u2019t give a \u2014 about racism within our own ranks. We are only anti-racist to score political points. Do as we say not as we do.\u201d Responding on Twitter to Hancock\u2019s comments, Miqdaad Versi, the director of the media monitoring team for the Muslim Council of Britain, said Hancock was trying to pretend Warsi was isolated in her criticism. \u201cThe reality is that evidence of the scale of Islamophobia in the party is huge albeit under-reported and deniers of its scale should be challenged with the truth,\u201d he tweeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
