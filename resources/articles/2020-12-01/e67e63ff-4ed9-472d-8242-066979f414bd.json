Arsenal sit 15th and have lost their past three league fixtures at the Emirates, struggling to create chances. A defeat in last weekend\u2019s north London derby at Tottenham did little to alleviate the sense their season is running away from them and Arteta regards Burnley\u2019s visit on Sunday as an opportunity to reset. \u201cWe can do nothing right now about what happened in the past few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the home form is going to be vital to our success and we have to change that immediately. So if we want to have any hope of doing something important and relevant this season, it has to be by winning the games at home. \u201cUnfortunately the results in the Premier League have not been what we want. We are very frustrated with that and we know how important it is to put some results together really quickly because we need them straight away.\u201d Burnley have taken only two points from their travels and have lost all six of their top-flight meetings at the Emirates. The alarm bells will ring even more loudly for Arsenal if the visitors are able to improve on those numbers and Arteta promised Sean Dyche\u2019s side would be matched for commitment. \u201cI am telling you that the desire, the commitment and everything that they will try to put on that pitch will be there,\u201d he said of his players. Arsenal will be backed by 2,000 fans for the first time in a league game since March, although that may be short-lived if London is put into a tier 3 lockdown next week. Arteta confirmed Thomas Partey would miss the next few games after aggravating a thigh injury at Spurs, while David Luiz\u2019s head injury is being assessed to discern his fitness for Sunday and Saints\u2019 visit on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
