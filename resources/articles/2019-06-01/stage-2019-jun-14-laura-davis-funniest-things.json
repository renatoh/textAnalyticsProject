It\u2019s so quirky and dark and surreal and human. The funniest person I know \u2026 My friend\u2019s five-year-old daughter Beatrix. She\u2019s a true master of cutting lines, wild impressions and surrealist improvisation. I hope she never grows out of it. The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 Once during the Perth fringe festival, no less than seven people had to be taken out of my show by security because they wouldn\u2019t stop yelling \u201cCats ARE furry\u201d at me. They were extremely drunk and misheard a joke I\u2019d said. The funniest item of clothing I\u2019ve ever owned \u2026 I once broke up a fight on the street while wearing a penguin-head beanie. I\u2019m not particularly tall, so the penguin\u2019s face was more at eye level with the drunk guy than I was. The funniest meal I\u2019ve ever eaten \u2026 Those chicken nuggets that are shaped to look like dinosaurs. Chickens evolved from dinosaurs, and now humans are trying to mash them back into dinosaurs. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 The time an apprentice hairdresser stuffed up my fringe and I looked like I\u2019d had a frontal lobotomy. I tried to pass it off as retro, but it turns out there\u2019s not a lot of nostalgia left for the early 1900s. The funniest thing that shouldn\u2019t be funny \u2026 Probably that we\u2019re all going to die. Everyone, everything. Hideous and hilarious all at once. Laura Davis plays Soho Theatre: Upstairs, W1, Thursday 20 to 22 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
