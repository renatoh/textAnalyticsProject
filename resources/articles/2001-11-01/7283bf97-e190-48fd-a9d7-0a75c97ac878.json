We were all there of course, but had set our videos to watch the match and celebrations. The game was on ITV and all the regions showed after-match celebrations with BFR and the lads receiving the Cup. All that is apart from L**dshire (Yorkshire) TV who chose instead to show War of the Monster Trucks. Well up yours YTV, your graphics are crap and your presenters are dumb and you're as intellectual as the Daily Mail. Angry still us? You bet. And grovelling on Goals on Sunday simply doesn't wash. The Editor Sir Stanley Headfire began life as a normal fat stinky run-of-the-mill Labrador, Stanley. One night after a snowy run on Wadsley Common he lay in front of the coal fire gently chumbling. His head got too close and steam turned into smoke. It was only by the emergency application of a full can of Stones Bitter that Stanley was saved. In the North, we all know that beer is a mental food and as the beer pickled his heated brain, Stanley, in a Superhero cartoon stylee, developed new powers of communication and a business presence. He uses both in his role of editor of War of the Monster Trucks. Sir Stanley has many friends including the sports team at BBC Radio Sheffield, the staff of the New Barrack Tavern (particularly those who have anything to do with sausages) the Sky TV Sheffield Crew, a Barnsley fan better known as Dancing Boy Thing From South America, Paolo Di Canio's pet monkey who has a fetish for grapes, and Frankie Fredrick - a Guinea Pig with powers of exorcism. Sir Stanley is a Swing and Be-Bop Jazz fan - he likes a loose and hypnotic rhythm. He is single and is a bit of a man about town around Hillsborough Park. His tipple is half a Barnsley Bitter. We welcome articles from all football fans of any team, but we do reserve the right not to publish articles that we find offensive. War of the Monster Trucks is independent of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the articles published in the fanzine do not represent the views of the Club. We hope that everyone reads the fanzine in the spirit that it is meant. We think that humour is often a good vehicle for creating an open and honest debate that is sadly lacking in football today. If you find an article offensive or simply disagree with something we've said, then we are happy to give a right of reply in the next issue. WOTMT are: Sir Stanley Headfire; Paul Taylor; Andy Selman; Steve Walmsley; Nick Riley (on loan to the Socialist Alliance). With regular help from Chris Hogg, Graham Lightfoot, Paul Register, Barry Birks, Ron Clayton, Mike Pidgeon, and the WISA Mob. And thanks to the various people we drink with, whose ideas we pinch.
