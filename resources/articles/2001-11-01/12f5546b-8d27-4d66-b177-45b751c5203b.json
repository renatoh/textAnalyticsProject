The Board of Control for Cricket in India has been given until Friday morning to state whether it intends to play Virender Sehwag, the batsman at the centre of the row that is threatening to split world cricket. The ICC has set the Friday deadline because it is making the safety of the public and players a priority. The repercussions of a match being called off shortly before the scheduled start, given the volatile nature of Indian crowds, do not bear thinking about. The Indian selectors then are being asked to declare their hand almost three days before they would normally be required. Yesterday the indications were that Sehwag, deemed to be serving a one-match suspension, would be picked. \"We will be selecting the team on merit,\" insisted Chandu Borde, the chairman of the Indian selectors who will announce the 14-man first Test squad this morning. \"As far as I am concerned [Sehwag] is available. There is no directive from the cricket control board. There is no pressure on me or the selection committee.\" One get-out for the Indians would be to pick him in the initial squad but subsequently omit him from the side - they would have to do so by Friday's deadline - now that Sadagoppan Ramesh is fit again. In a lengthy letter to the president of the Indian board Jagmohan Dalmiya in which he details ICC's stance on Sehwag, the ICC's chief executive Malcolm Speed says that the governing body of the international game and the Indian authorities are on \"a collision course and that the consequences for world cricket are of great significance\". Speed was hoping last night to speak to Dalmiya by telephone in the hope that the Indian board would back down in the face of what is claimed to be support from a large proportion of the ICC's 13-man executive board. Failure to make headway would seem to leave the ICC little option but to remove India's international status, a fate previously suffered only by South Africa during the apartheid years. \"If it is a matter that the executive board or the conference of all the members wishes to take up at any stage then that's up to them,\" said Speed. But to this end, England are believed to be prepared to pull the plug on a tour that was full of controversy even before the team left home and has been dogged by it ever since. The consequences for them are clear: India are due to tour England in the second half of next summer but that would be sacrificed although contingencies, probably involving a Rest of the World side, are believed to be in place. Dalmiya has indicated that he would stop India touring next summer if England abandoned the current series but the decision could be made for him. For India, loss of international status would be a body blow, with severe financial repercussions. Sehwag was given a one-match suspension by the match referee Mike Denness for excessive appealing and abusive language during the recent second Test between India and South Africa. The batsman was subsequently omitted from the third and final match in Centurion but the ICC is adamant that that game does not have Test status because Denness, who disciplined a total of six Indian players, had been refused as a referee by both teams. \"It is a clear challenge to the authority of ICC as the governing body of the game,\" said Speed yesterday, \"and we have responded to that in the clearest terms. If ICC had overturned the decision of the referee, removed him from the match in Centurion or vacated the penalties it would have been an invitation for it to happen the next time anyone was unhappy with decisions of the referee, umpires or any other match official. \"We have already cancelled the status of one Test, which is an unprecedented move, and I don't want to see it happen again because every time we do that we damage the game. It is hypothetical but if tours were cancelled then the game loses. We will be trying very hard to achieve a solution by Friday.\" Speed has challenged Dalmiya to bring his grievances to the next meeting of the ICC's executive in Colombo next March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
