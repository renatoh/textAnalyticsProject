Trump left Afghanistan three and half hours after he arrived and flew back to his Florida resort of Mar-a-Lago, leaving behind conflicting clues about his intentions. He restated his frequent promise that he would bring the troops home, but also insisted: \u201cWe don\u2019t play for ties,\u201d adding: \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay until such time as we have a deal or we have total victory.\u201d Distributing hot dinners to soldiers is a standard requisite for being commander-in-chief, though it is one that Trump has largely managed to avoid. After nearly three years in office, it was his first visit to Afghanistan and only his second trip in the vicinity of a war zone. But with the presidential election now less than a year away, and the grey cloud of impeachment hanging over the White House, he is cloaking himself as tightly as he can in khaki. Over the past few months, Trump has embraced his role as commander-in-chief, announcing unheralded military movements in and out of Syria and intervening repeatedly in the military justice system to absolve service soldiers accused of war crimes. The US military \u2013 or its leadership at least \u2013 is hardly reveling in the president\u2019s attention. A spate of reports cite former commanders and unnamed active duty senior officers complaining about the undermining of the chain of command and the corrosion of the integrity of an institution most Americans have seen as a pillar of the republic \u2013 an incorruptible and disciplined armed forces. CNN reported \u201cat least two senior military officers\u201d had been reluctant to appear alongside Trump at recent official events, out of fear of he would come out with partisan remarks. Richard Spencer, the secretary of the navy fired last week after clashing with the president over war crimes cases, wrote in the Washington Post that it was \u201ca reminder that the president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices\u201d. It is a far cry from the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency, when he surrounded himself with military brass and boasted about \u201chis generals\u201d. One by one those grand martial figures have left the administration, to be lampooned by their commander-in-chief on their way out the door as \u201cfailed generals\u201d who were \u201cnot tough enough\u201d and \u201coverrated\u201d. More senior officers are reported to be considering resignation, if the president continues to meddle in what they see as the preserve of the military. But Trump is unlikely to stop. The president has held up war crimes defendants as \u201cwarriors\u201d, betrayed by their politically correct superiors. \u201cWe train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!\u201d he complained in a tweet. \u201cThat represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the American warrior ethic,\u201d said Rachel VanLandingham, a retired air force lieutenant colonel and a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cA true warrior is one who who exercises restraint and it requires moral courage to exercise restraint.\u201d But Trump\u2019s ideal is encouraged by the pundits he watches on Fox News. He has granted pardons in similar cases earlier in the year, and he clearly believes it fires up his base. The Daily Beast reported he was planning to hit the campaign trail with the three soldiers he recently absolved of war crimes charges. The trio includes the former army lieutenant Clint Lorance, sentenced to 19 years in prison for murder after ordering his men to open fire on three unarmed Afghan men riding past on a motorcycle, killing two of them. And the Green Beret major Matthew Golsteyn, who was facing murder charges after admitting to CIA interviewers that he had killed an unarmed detainee, a suspected bomb-maker, and burned the corpse while serving in Afghanistan in 2010. Trump pardoned both two weeks ago. He also intervened repeatedly in the case of the Navy Seal chief Edward Gallagher, who had been acquitted of the murder of an unarmed detainee, but demoted after being found guilty of posing for a \u201ctrophy\u201d photograph with the corpse. Trump went on Twitter to insist Gallagher keep his trident pin, the celebrated badge of the elite unit, in defiance of a Navy Seal review board. The defendant\u2019s lawyers had found a way of working around the military justice system by getting their cases a sympathetic hearing on Fox, knowing it has an avid viewer in the White House. Their cases were championed in particular by Pete Hegseth, a weekend chat show host on Fox &amp; Friends who is a former reserve military officer, with a dedicated following in the ranks of the armed forces. Hegseth has been scathing over the senior officers who criticize Trump. Gallagher appeared on Hegseth\u2019s show last Sunday, and shocked the military hierarchy by trashing his superiors while still on active duty. He accused Spencer of meddling and the navy special war commander of insubordination for resisting Trump\u2019s interference in military justice. \u201cThere will be subset of the military who will see this as his way of taking on the system, and protecting this guy,\u201d said Katrina Mulligan, who served in the Obama administration\u2019s national security council and justice department and is now managing director for national security and international policy at the Center for American Progress. \u201cMost people in the military and other national security institutions will find it deeply upsetting. You don\u2019t grow up in military service without a healthy respect for the way military justice operates,\u201d she added. The war crimes meddling is just one point of friction between the commander-in-chief and the military. Trump \u2013 who never served in the military, and avoided Vietnam by claiming to have \u201cbone spurs\u201d \u2013 has claimed greater expertise than his commanders, and has fired off orders on Twitter with little or no consultation. In early October, he ordered all US troops out of Syria, having been persuaded to take that course of action by Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, only to command his forces back in little more than two weeks later, to \u201csecure the oil\u201d. He diverted nearly $13bn in military construction projects and thousands of troops to help build his long-promised wall on the southern border. He abruptly cut off year-long negotiations with the Taliban in September, but declared them back on during his Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan. There was no apparent shift in underlying circumstances in either case. Trump is fond of talking about \u201cmy military\u201d, but the claim is less true with every passing month. Veterans still support him in significantly greater numbers than the general population, but he no longer has a lead among active duty service members, who are fairly evenly split between approval and disapproval. The damage done to the fabric of the military, by the divisions and uncertainty stirred up by the commander-in-chief, is harder to calculate. \u201cBy intervening, Trump is creating circumstances where the men and women in uniform are being asked to take sides between the superior officers and the president,\u201d Mulligan said. \u201cIt makes you wonder: is nothing sacred? Sadly, the answer is no.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
