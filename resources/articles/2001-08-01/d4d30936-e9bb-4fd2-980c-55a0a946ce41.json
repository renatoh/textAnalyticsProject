They were also said to have been training guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), a group financed by the drug trade, in what one security source described as an exercise of \"mutual benefit\". Niall Connolly, named by Cuban authorities as Sinn Fein's official representative in Havana, James Monaghan and Martin McCauley, both thought to be among the IRA's top bomb-makers, are likely to be deported from Colombia within the next few days. Traces of explosives were found on their clothing according to the authorities in Bogota. The security forces believe they were testing a bomb containing a mixture of gas and explosives which vaporises oxygen creating a huge fireball, it was reported yesterday. Similar devices have been used by Farc in attacks on oil exploration and police bases in Colombia. The group is said to have been experimenting with mortar bombs consisting of gas cylinders made out of explosives, fuel and shrapnel. Devices known as \"fuel bombs\" have been developed by a number of armies around the world. But some security sources said yesterday they were perplexed by reports that the three men had been developing a new more deadly type of device and it is still felt they had been training the guerrillas in methods tried and trusted by the IRA in Britain and Northern Ireland over the past 30 years. Traces found on the skin and clothing of the three suspects included four kinds of explosives, officials in Bogota said yesterday. A senior source in Northern Ireland said: \"The Provos are constantly developing new weapons and have continued to do so despite their cease-fire. Unfortunately they have proved all too capable of causing loss of life and mass damage but the trend has been for the Provos to produce more accurate devices aimed at specific targets. \"They have been using a simple form of napalm for many years and any sort of \"super bomb\" would prove to be too indiscriminate for the modern Provos.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
