Hull, who were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of last season, were twice in control against Accrington, known to their followers as the club that refused to die for their ability to survive against all financial odds. Goals from the substitutes Chuba Akpom, an on-loan Arsenal striker, and Greg Luer were pegged back by Matt Crooks\u2019 towering header and a scruffy rebound from Terry Gornell, sending the contest to spot-kicks. Accrington led 2-1 after the England Under-21 defender Harry Maguire blazed over the bar but Curtis Davies stepped up to score the Championship side\u2019s fourth spot kick and Crooks lost his nerve and put his effort over to send Hull into round two. \u201cWe were lackadaisical and not playing as quick as what we should have done. We played it like it was a pre-season friendly and sometimes that happens when you come to places like this,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cLosing games like this can damage you and that\u2019s the cup in this country, it\u2019s why we love them.\u201d Only when Akpom, in glowing orange boots, emerged from the bench to replace an uninterested Nikica Jelavic on the hour did Hull\u2019s overall enthusiasm match that of their \u00a33.5m debutant Moses Odubajo, a recent acquisition from Brentford. With the clock running down in normal time, the two teams went toe to toe in their search of a winning goal with the son of the Hull club ambassador Dean Windass, Josh, shooting on sight to force Eldin Jakupovic to punch out a drive which looked destined for the top corner. Akpom\u2019s clinical left-foot finish across the Accrington goalkeeper, Jason Mooney, at 6ft 9in the tallest player in the Football League, put the Championship side in front two minutes into extra time. However, an equally authoritative header from the Accrington midfielder Crooks, who connected with Piero Mingoia\u2019s right-wing centre, levelled things at 1-1. And a repeat in the second 15-minute period \u2013 the 20-year-old Luer climbing highest to head home before Gornell punished Jakupovic\u2019s poor handling \u2013 sent the tie to penalties. In the end it was the 1,097 away supporters who contributed to more than 50% of the attendance that went home smiling, although Bruce acknowledged they had been pushed to the limit by an Accrington team with Windass pulling the strings in the pocket behind the striker Billy Kee. Indeed, Accrington might have had their name in the hat for Thursday night\u2019s second-round draw had Kee kept his composure when, with the score at 2-2, he dragged a shot against Maguire. There was even a hint of handball but the giantkilling was not to be. \u201cWalking off the ground people were congratulating us. What for? We are out of the cup. We should be proud of our performance but there\u2019s no pride in getting beat. We know the rules, that the game can go to penalties and we came up short,\u201d said the Stanley manager, John Coleman. For Bruce, who fielded seven full internationals, victory proved a huge relief. Attention will now turn to adding two further creative players \u2013 Chicago Fire\u2019s Scotland international Shaun Maloney and Odubajo\u2019s former Brentford team-mate Andre Gray ahead of the trip to Wolves. Dialogue continues between Hull and both clubs for the players in question."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
