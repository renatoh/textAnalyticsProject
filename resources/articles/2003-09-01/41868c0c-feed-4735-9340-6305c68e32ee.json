Johnson's broken leg is likely to sideline him for six months but on this evidence his team-mates are managing quite nicely without him. Harewood was the architect of this success, scoring his sixth goal of the season and laying on two others with aplomb. He was a genuine hero as well - playing despite a chest infection which almost forced the Forest manager Paul Hart to leave him out of the side. But he was also ably assisted by Gareth Taylor, who looked almost apologetic as he finished off his former club with the third goal on 82 minutes, consigning Burnley to their third successive defeat and leaving Stan Ternent wringing his hands. Burnley were denied a penalty in first-half injury-time and suffered further torment when Darren Ward turned their substitute Paul Weller's close-range effort on to the bar just after the interval. Harewood undid them with an early strike, followed up with a magnificent crossfield pass which released Andy Reid to score their second after 76 minutes, and then presented Taylor with his first goal for his new club eight minutes from time. \"That win was for David Johnson,\" said Hart. \"We were all deeply upset by what happened on Saturday. \"Marlon scored one and made two yet he almost didn't play - we had to send him home yesterday because he was ill.\" Gareth Williams appeared to bring down Ian Moore when the score was 1-0 and a different decision by Alan Kaye, who waved away the Claret appeals, might have brought a different result. But Forest deserved their victory, though Ternent insisted: \"Three-nil looks like a pasting but it wasn't. We were caught sleeping on the second goal and that finished it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
