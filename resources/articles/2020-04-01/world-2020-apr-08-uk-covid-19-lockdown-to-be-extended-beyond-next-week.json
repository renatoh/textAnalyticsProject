The death toll from coronavirus is continuing to rise daily, with 938 UK fatalities announced on Wednesday \u2013 close to the highest daily figures reported in Italy and Spain. Medical experts are not expecting the peak to come for more than week. With the long Easter weekend looming, ministers are concerned that any suggestion of an imminent loosening of restrictions could result in an immediate change in the public\u2019s behaviour. The Guardian has learned that at least five police chief constables want the government to consider toughening coronavirus lockdown restrictions amid concerns that a growing minority will flout the rules over the bank holiday. Options for more stringent curbs include preventing people driving long distances and legislation to enforce the government\u2019s order to limit exercise to once a day. Government sources suggested Raab, the foreign secretary deputising for Boris Johnson \u201cwhere necessary\u201d, would address the issue at Thursday\u2019s Downing Street press conference \u2013 and prepare the public for an extension of the measures put in place on 23 March. Legislation to implement the measures dictates that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, must also oversee a formal review of their impact by next Thursday \u2013 and another within three weeks after that. Johnson, 55, was set to spend a third night in intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London on Wednesday night. While his condition was said to be improving \u2013 with Johnson able to sit up and talk to medics \u2013 Raab is now chairing the powerful four-man Covid-19 committee, which has continued to drive the government\u2019s response to the crisis while the prime minister is in hospital. The group, effectively an inner cabinet that meets daily, also includes the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, Hancock and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. On Tuesday, Raab declined to say whether a review of the restrictions would take place as planned next week, in the absence of Johnson. But the foreign secretary is expected to address the issue directly on Thursday, after a Cobra meeting in the morning \u2013 the first since the measures were imposed. Current restrictions oblige the public to remain at home unless they are exercising, shopping for essentials or going to a job that cannot be carried out at home. Pressure for clarity from the government intensified on Wednesday, as senior politicians from across the UK suggested the lockdown must remain in force. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: \u201cI think when the prime minister announced the lockdown just over two and half weeks ago, he said he would review it in three weeks\u2019 time, which is this Monday. I think we\u2019re nowhere near lifting the lockdown. \u201cIn London we lost 224 lives [on Tuesday], so we\u2019re still, I\u2019m afraid, on a daily basis seeing too many people losing their lives. At the moment thankfully we\u2019ve got some spare capacity in intensive care units in London but we can\u2019t be complacent at all.\u201d In Northern Ireland, the communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, suggested the lockdown should remain in place \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, told an online meeting of the Welsh assembly: \u201cWe will not throw away the gains we have made, and the lives we can save, by abandoning our efforts just as they begin to bear fruit.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is more work to do in reviewing the regulations. The precise nature of what will follow the current regime will be agreed over the coming days.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon also said that Scotland is not expecting to see an end to the lockdown any time soon. It is understood that evidence to the Scottish government does not support the idea that the peak of cases or deaths is imminent north of the border, and the expectation in Holyrood is that rigorous physical distancing is likely to have to go on for 12-13 weeks. Sunak made clear at Wednesday\u2019s press conference that the evidence is not yet available to enable politicians to lift the lockdown \u2013 and suggested formal confirmation of any extension may not come until next week. He said the Cobra meeting on Thursday would \u201ctalk about the approach to the review\u201d. \u201cWe committed that there would be a review in and around three weeks; that review will be based on the evidence and the data provided by Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies], which will only be available next week,\u201d he said. \u201cOur priority right now is to stop the spread of this virus: to get the other side of the peak,\u201d he added. That message was underlined by the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Angela McLean, who said the government would need evidence about whether the entire \u201csuite\u201d of lockdown measures is working, before any decision to lift them could be made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
