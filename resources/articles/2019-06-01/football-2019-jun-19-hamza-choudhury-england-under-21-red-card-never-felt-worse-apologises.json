The England midfielder admitted he let down his team with the foul that led to Bamba going to hospital and prompted a VAR review to upgrade his yellow card to a red. Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s side were leading 1-0 at the time but the 10 men succumbed to two late goals and a defeat that jeopardises their chances of reaching the semi-finals. Choudhury apologised to the France bench in the immediate aftermath of damaging Bamba\u2019s ankle ligaments. The Lille forward has been ruled out of the rest of the tournament. After the game a visibly upset Choudhury extended the apology to the England team and their supporters. \u201cI just want to let everyone know that I know I have let them down,\u201d the 21-year-old said. \u201cI just want to get that message out there and really apologise. I remember that the ball was there to be won but, honestly, watching back it looked like I was over-aggressive. It wasn\u2019t malicious and I didn\u2019t want to hurt him whatsoever. \u201cI saw the ball and tried to take it but I mistimed it. I don\u2019t think I have ever felt worse in my footballing career than I do right now. I have let the lads down, I have let the country down. I understand playing at this level comes with a certain pressure.\u201d The Leicester midfielder will be suspended for Friday\u2019s must-win Group C game against Romania, who beat Croatia 4-1 on Tuesday, and will discover that day whether the ban will stretch to two matches. The red card was the second of Choudhury\u2019s senior career \u2013 the first coming on loan at Burton more than three years ago. \u201cI will go back and think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next time I get in that situation, I won\u2019t make that tackle. Right now, I am just upset. The lads were brilliant with me to be honest; they picked me up off the floor, they told me to keep my head up. But right now, I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s a really difficult time.\u201d Choudhury\u2019s Leicester teammate Demarai Gray has claimed England remain the best team in the tournament despite the loss to France and will not be unnerved by their precarious position in the group. Boothroyd\u2019s players must back up Gray\u2019s confidence against Romania on Friday or their chances of securing a route to the semi-finals, possibly via the best runners-up berth, will be gone. \u201cI know the players we have in the team,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI thought the goal [by Phil Foden] was different class and he is the youngest here. There is quality in the team. I believe we are the best team here. We lost in an unfortunate way but there is still every chance to go through. We are not worried.\u201d Gray was among the culprits as England squandered several excellent chances but, despite the manner of defeat, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka slicing into his own goal in the 95th minute, the 22-year-old said the squad remained united. \u201cEveryone is hurting but the spirit is fine. No one is on to each other, no one is down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
