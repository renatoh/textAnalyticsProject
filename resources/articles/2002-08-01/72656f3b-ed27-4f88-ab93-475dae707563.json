Lindsay Armstrong, 17, took an overdose of anti-depressants after she was raped by the then 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Her family say she never recovered from the attack and the humiliation of the trial when she was asked to show the court the underwear she had been wearing at the time of the assault. The boy had earlier been found guilty of raping Ms Armstrong in a park near her home in New Cumnock, Ayrshire, in September last year. At the high court in Glasgow yesterday the judge, Lord McEwan, told the boy he was a risk to females and had a great number of problems. He ordered him to be detained for four years in a secure unit and placed under a supervision order for a further three years. He will also be placed on the sex offenders' register. Ms Armstrong's mother, Linda, said her daughter had been mentally and physically scarred by her ordeal and the trial that followed. Her family found the teenager's body in her bed on July 16, just weeks after her attacker was convicted, after taking an overdose of anti-depressants, given to her to help her get through the trial. \"She was determined to give evidence against him and for him to be found guilty as she didn't want it to happen to anyone else,\" said Mrs Armstrong, 39. \"I think that taking her own life was the only way she could find peace.\" Her daughter had had a bright future and just weeks before the attack had achieved eight standard grades, five with credit, from Cumnock Academy. \"After what happened to her she became withdrawn and quit school. She wasn't as loud as before and was scared to leave the house,\" said Mrs Armstrong. \"She wanted to go to the sentencing to see justice being done. She was obviously going through so much turmoil and felt she couldn't take any more.\" Ms Armstrong's father, Frank, said the family was angry at the way Lindsay was treated during the trial. On two occasions, the teenager was asked to show the court the underwear she had been wearing on the day of the assault. Her family say she had been made to feel as if she was to blame for the rape and felt \"totally destroyed\" after being cross-examined. \"This should not be allowed to happen,\" said Mr Armstrong. \"Girls should be treated with respect and dignity.\" Sandy Brindley, of the Glasgow Rape Crisis Centre, said that despite legislation due to come into force in Scotland to minimise the court ordeal of rape victims, women were still being humiliated as a matter of course. What happened was a tragedy but not surprising \"given the trauma women can go through from being raped and the secondary trauma of going through the justice system\". Court was not the best environment in which to give evidence, Ms Brindley added, \"being forced to give details you might not even share with your closest friends and family in front of strangers\". Under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act, which comes into force later this year an accused in a rape case will not be able to cross-examine the victim himself, and lawyers will have to prove relevance before they can bring up a victim's sexual history. Ms Brindley said it was unlikely, however, that the new law would have prevented the teenager being asked to hold up her underwear before the court. She said there were moves to include rape victims in people classed as \"vulnerable\" and warranting special protection when giving evidence. Before the boy was sentenced yesterday his lawyer, John Carruthers, expressed his sympathies to the Armstrong family. He said that his client had found himself in an \"extraordinary situation\" since he was convicted on June 26, referring to Ms Armstrong's death and the media coverage it had generated. She had gone to the park with the boy of her own accord, he said, and his client had not pre-planned the rape."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
