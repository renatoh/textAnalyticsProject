Baden-Baden", "bodyText": "Why? I had been driving around Italy in a clapped out old Rolls-Royce and I wanted to find somewhere to unwind for a bit before embarking on the last leg of my homeward journey, so I headed for Baden-Baden. It's a very civilised, aristocratic, town which has a fantastic James Bond-style casino. I found myself winding down the windows of the car and driving round and round the car park in this great old car with The Avengers theme on the stereo. My perfect day: A trip to the baths and then to the casino. A proper masseuse at the baths will pummel you for two hours, and you need at least an hour more to recover. The best thing: Apart from the casino, it's great to be in among the incredible neo-classical buildings that make Baden-Baden such a special place. And of course there are the baths - the only problem with them is that it's slightly arresting being in the company of so many fat, naked people. The experience can knock you out for several hours. My advice: If I were you, I would familiarise yourself with the German phrase, \"put your trunks on here\". There are areas where you can put them on and others where you're meant to go without them on. Getting it wrong is a definite no-no. How to get there: A three-night weekend break in Baden Baden with Moswin (0116 2719922) will cost \u00a3309 per person (based on two sharing). The price includes return flights from Heathrow, rail transfers and accommodation with breakfast.
