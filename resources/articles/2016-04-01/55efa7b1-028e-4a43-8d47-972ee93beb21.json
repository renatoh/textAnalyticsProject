When Blind signed for the club in summer 2014 he was viewed primarily as a midfielder. Yet the 26-year-old has operated at left-back and, for the majority of this campaign, at the heart of United\u2019s rearguard. Smalling pointed to Blind\u2019s versatility as being a major asset. \u201cIt is great knowing he is naturally a midfielder so he has that passing range and ability down to a tee and defensively he is very sound as well,\u201d said the defender. \u201cHe brings a lot to our defensive line in being able to play the ball out and cut through teams. \u201cHe deserves more plaudits and I think he will get them if he carries on playing the way he is playing. Everyone is standing up and taking note that Daley is one of the mainstays of this team and he is keeping us ticking. \u201cIt is a good partnership. We know we can rely on each other. When there is a situation you don\u2019t have to over cover because you don\u2019t trust your partner. We trust each other fully and we bring out the best in each other as the games have gone on and the more games we have played together. \u201cBy each performance he is putting any critics out there to bed. He has been one of the top centre backs this year.\u201d In Sunday\u2019s 1-0 victory over Everton at Old Trafford Blind again impressed. \u201cOne of the main reasons the manager first put him there was he could play on the ball and he was a left footer,\u201d Smalling said. \u201cHe has got a lot more to his game than any of us really thought. In one-on-one duels for instance, as you saw against Everton, [Romelu] Lukaku didn\u2019t get any change from him. Daley is not the biggest or strongest but he is very clever and smart and big strikers or fast strikers don\u2019t get any change from him. \u201cWhen someone like Lukaku gets you in the position where he\u2019s holding you off it is key to try and nick it in front of him. He can pin you in the box but he didn\u2019t get anything out of Daley.\u201d Blind has featured in the majority of the club\u2019s games, making 47 appearances in all competitions. He has also played six times for Holland. Smalling said: \u201cEver since he joined the club he has rarely been injured. He has been able to bang out the games and have a very high consistency. He is a joy to play alongside.\u201d Phil Jones is available again following injury and he follows Antonio Valencia\u2019s recent return to offer Louis van Gaal a further option in defence. \u201cIt is great to have the numbers back and great to see some more senior faces on the bench. All the numbers are needed,\u201d Smalling said. On Sunday United are at Tottenham Hotspur. The win over Everton closed Van Gaal\u2019s team to a point behind Manchester City, who are in the final Champions League qualification berth. Smalling said: \u201cWe need to win games. Three points puts pressure on those above. It is a massive game at Spurs now. They are playing for a lot and so are we. We have found this season that we have often played better against the top teams and hopefully that continues. \u201cThere was a lot of relief [beating Everton]. It was one where we were hanging on a little bit. Against a good team one goal is never going to be enough. You want teams to slip up but if we are winning our games then we have given ourselves a chance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
