Our group opponents look beatable, and there's a clear route to the semi-finals. The problem is we could easily lose every group game too. We have three ways of playing: 1) Matching the opposition, so we can look great against Brazil (as we did in our qualifier) and terrible against Australia (as we did when we missed out on 2006); 2) We excel at \"moral victories\" \u2013 dominating games, yet not winning; and 3) Our best-known style: kicking the living daylights out of the opposition. Red cards could be a problem. Men to watch: We have one of the best forward lines in Diego Forl\u00e1n and Ajax's Luis Su\u00e1rez, who will be playing for a transfer too. In midfield, Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro, just 21, plays with a lot of dazzle and confidence \u2013 too much, some think. He's the type of player who will slalom past four only to unleash an ill-advised shot instead of a pass. He will need to make good decisions. Weakest link: Our full-backs \u2013 Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres (Juventus) and Jorge Fucile (Porto) \u2013 aren't the greatest. The coach: \u00d3scar W\u00e1shington Tab\u00e1rez always plays two up-front, one link-man, and three other midfielders. There's little of interest, tactically. Best chant: We tend to chant \"Soy celeste\" over and over. It just means \"I am light blue.\" Simple, powerful. Least-liked opponents: Germany, Cristiano Ronaldo and also Thierry Henry. TIPS Winner: Spain, but Holland may have a chance. Golden boot: David Villa (Spain). England: They'll beat USA 1-0, Algeria 2-0 and draw with Slovenia 1-1, the press will go crazy, then they'll be hammered by Ghana 3-1. Mark my words!
