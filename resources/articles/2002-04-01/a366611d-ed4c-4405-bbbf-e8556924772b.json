It was the German's fourth win in five races, the 57th of his career and, with 12 races still to run, leaves him just six victories short of beating the one-season record of nine wins which he shares with Nigel Mansell in the record books. Schumacher's Ferrari F2002 took the chequered flag 35.6sec ahead of Juan Pablo Montoya's Williams-BMW and David Coulthard's McLaren-Mercedes, which had benefited from the troubles of faster cars ahead of him to claim third place on the podium. Fourth and fifth were the Saubers of Nick Heidfeld and Felipe Massa with Heinz-Harald Frentzen scoring the final point of the afternoon, and the Arrows team's first of the year, with sixth. Montoya's drive was hampered by a bizarre incident on lap 45 when the Colombian came in for his second refuelling stop. The Williams chief mechanic Carl Gaden lifted the \"lollipop\" indicating that their man could resume the race but the refuelling hose had not been detached. Gaden dropped the sign back over the front of the Williams to stop Montoya and the driver had the presence of mind to disengage the hand clutch before stalling the engine. Unfortunately Gaden's left foot became trapped under the Williams's left front wheel and the car had to be moved back slightly before he could disentangle himself. Massa and Frentzen were the survivors of the best battle of the afternoon which had earlier also included both the Renault R202s of Jenson Button and Jarno Trulli until they were both slowed by technical problems. The seamless domination of the Ferrari team was boosted by Schumacher's remarkable good fortune after a morning warm-up in which his race car rolled to a halt out on the circuit. He switched to his spare Ferrari for the 65-lap race and it never missed a beat - in cruel contrast to the fate of his team-mate Rubens Barrichello who had qualified a close second only to be stranded on the grid prior to the final formation lap when his Ferrari refused to select any gears. After a brief attempt to coax the machine into life, Barrichello's car was pushed away to the pit lane garages and retired. \"Obviously, as we had the [earlier] problem, with Rubens we tried to take care of whatever he had,\" said Schumacher after the race. \"But it really is bad luck for Rubens. Everything that has gone wrong this year so far has gone wrong for him. At the pit stops we did things a little more carefully in order to make sure that the same thing didn't happen [to me].\" Schumacher completed the opening lap 1.5sec ahead of the Williams duo Ralf Schumacher and Montoya with Kimi Raikkonen's McLaren fourth ahead of Button's Renault and Coulthard's McLaren. By the end of lap four the Ferrari was 2.9sec ahead just as Raikkonen's McLaren shed most of its rear wing and the young Finn came straight into the pits to retire. Rear wings were much in the news yesterday after Mark Webber suffered a similar breakage in his Minardi at 170mph on the pit straight during the warm-up and spun at high speed into the gravel trap at the first corner. This followed two front wing breakages for Webber and his team-mate Alex Yoong the previous day, prompting the team to fly back the suspect components to their Italian factory at Faenza in one of team principal Paul Stoddart's Boeing 737s. They were returned in time for the warm-up, but following the rear wing failure the team withdrew both drivers from the race on safety grounds. When Raikkonen's wing flew off there was much speculation in the pit lane that Coulthard's car might at least be called in for a precautionary inspection, but the McLaren team checked its technical database within minutes and confirmed that the wing on Coulthard's car was slightly newer than Raikkonen's so he was allowed to continue. During the opening phase of the race Coulthard was chasing Button for all his worth, gaining time on the 22-year-old through the first spate of refuelling stops and then neatly outbraking Button for third place at the end of the start-finish straight at the start of lap 34. By the time Schumacher was ready for his first refuelling stop his Ferrari was 36.8sec ahead of Montoya, allowing him to emerge from the pits at the end of lap 26 still 11.0sec ahead of Montoya who had made his stop a lap earlier. By lap 45 Schumacher was almost 40sec ahead of Montoya when the Colombian suffered his pit-stop hitch. Montoya resumed just over 5sec ahead of Coulthard but was never challenged for second place from then on. Meanwhile Schumacher reeled off the laps towards the chequered flag, politely keeping back from lapping the feisty battle for sixth place. \"I didn't really plan to go by because I thought it was interesting to watch that,\" said Schumacher, deadpan. \"There was no need to disturb them fighting for sixth place.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
