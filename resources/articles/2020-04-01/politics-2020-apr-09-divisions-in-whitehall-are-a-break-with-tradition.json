When I joined in the 1950s, the civil service had maintained the wartime tradition of trust and cooperation between ministers and senior officials \u2013 and Armstrong\u2019s distinguished career eminently reflected that tradition in later times. A crisis (such as coronavirus) would be met by forming a committee of ministers (not joint minister-officials like Cobra), supported by a committee of senior officials to coordinate the work of relevant departments, which would then brief their ministers \u2013 all organised by the Cabinet Office, which would brief the prime minister. This matched the theory of \u201ccabinet government\u201d. Special advisers were few, mainly experts like the \u201cHungarian twins\u201d \u2013 economists Thomas Balogh and Nicholas Kaldor \u2013 and scientific adviser Solly Zuckerman. What a contrast with the picture that emerges of our current government \u2013 a head of the civil service without much experience of the workings of Whitehall, trying to coordinate the work of departments headed by permanent secretaries who were appointed to make huge cuts in the service and are now struggling to win the trust of small-state politicians surrounded by clamorous special advisers and instinctively suspicious of departmental advice. But I am absolutely confident that the tradition is still there and that everyone is doing their very best in these challenging times. Sir Alan Bailey Permanent secretary, Department of Transport, 1986-91 \u2022 The letter above was amended on 10 April 2020 to restore the words \u201cthe picture that emerges of\u201d, which had been lost during the editing process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
