She's not exactly a trendy young comic \u2013 instead, she's a proudly ordinary woman from South Shields who's more likely to be found at home on the sofa in pyjamas than staggering out of a nightclub. What's taken Millican from the lower rungs of the comedy circuit to her own BBC2 series \u2013 via a scene-stealing turn on The Graham Norton Show, discussing farts with a stunned P Diddy, and an unlikely stint on the Loose Women panel \u2013 is her ability to mix well-observed gags with incredible amounts of filth. She's got a flair for crude and shocking comedy that rivals many more obviously outrageous comics, but the blend of her polite and proper stage persona and quietly sophisticated writing skills mean that she's able to get away with that much more. Make sure you get the chance to see her in a (relatively) small venue while you can, because she could be the first female comic to make the leap to arenas. Sheffield City Hall, Sat; Grimsby Auditorium, Sun; Wolverhampton Civic Hall, Tue; Symphony Hall, Birmingham, Thu Patton Oswalt: Finest Hour, CD/download He may lack the chic sitcom pedigree of some US stand-up names but Patton Oswalt is a comic who'll delight anyone who likes smart and abrasive contrarian comedy. A likable slob who cites the invention of sweatpants as the pinnacle of human creativity, Oswalt's casual attitude disguises a sharp, questioning mind and an intolerance of everyday celebrity bullshit. In this new audio release he covers a lot of eclectic ground, from lowbrow staples like fatherhood and knob gags to more out-there ideas \u2013 at times you'll find him veering from exploring the inanity of Jennifer Aniston romcoms to theorising about the superpowers of Jesus. While he's got plenty of disdain to dish out to Hollywood and the religious right, Oswalt's not simply a predictable US liberal. In fact, he reserves some of his fiercest shots for hipsters who prize ironic cool over things of real value. Comedy Central, out now Live Ghost Hunt, online Halloween certainly seems to act as a creative spur for more spookily-minded comics. Following last year's excellent The Institute (which saw a bunch of comics staging a zombie thriller in an abandoned office block), the challenge of mixing scares with jokes has been taken up by Dan Tetsell and Danny Robins with this very special one-off event. Live Ghost Hunt sees distinguished paranormal investigator Edwin Griffiths (Tetsell) and Babestation's resident psychic Maurice Smythe (Robins) teaming up to stage a series of experiments into whether or not ghosts exist. This isn't a conventional live comedy event but a multimedia spectacular \u2013 visit the website on Halloween night and you'll be able to watch the latest reports from the Hunt, interact with the team and \"contact the spirits of the dead\". While you may not end up getting definitive proof of paranormal activity, there should be plenty to enjoy in terms of well-crafted character comedy.
