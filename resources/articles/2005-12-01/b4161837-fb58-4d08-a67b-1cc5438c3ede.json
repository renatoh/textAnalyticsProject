Saturday does not mean sitting in the stand getting screwed up when little things go wrong, and Sunday does not mean sitting in front of a video rewinding the horror show over and over again in preparation for the inevitable Monday morning confrontations. Rugby is still on the agenda of course, but I get to choose which match I see. The temptation this weekend would be Sale versus Castres tonight, followed by a three-hour drive down the M5 and M6 on Sunday to see the Ospreys at home to Leicester. Why? Simply because I think there would be a better than 50-50 chance of getting a bit of enjoyment. For years Sale have had the ability to frighten the pants off teams. Their back three of Jason Robinson, Mark Cueto and Steve Hanley could, from almost anywhere, run in the tries dreamed up by Charlie Hodgson and engineered by that much under-rated centre Jos Baxendell. Last weekend without the injured Hanley and with Baxendell departed for a new life as a surveyor - something he managed part-time even when playing - the new Sale did something else. They proved just how far they have moved on by travelling to the Midi and bringing back their first Heineken Cup victory in France. The threat of the back three was still there and Hodgson was pulling the strings, but the new ingredient was a pack that could stand up to the big men of Castres; a couple of years ago they might easily have caved in. It could have been the kind of dour match that has littered the Guinness Premiership this season. After all, four of the coaches involved - Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 and Kingsley Jones for Sale and Laurent Seigne and Dave Ellis for Castres - know each other inside out having worked together at Gloucester. Instead it was a good old-fashioned game with three tries and enough tension to crackle in the chill air of the south of France. Then on Sunday came another throw-back fixture - Leicester versus the Ospreys - and a look at what we are missing in our league rugby. For 20 minutes the Ospreys were scintillating. Gavin Henson, looking quicker and sharper than he did last season, should have scored with his first touch and opened up the Leicester defence a second time for the first try. He teased with feints and dummies - just as English backs used to - and off-loaded to runners who arrived at angles that guaranteed space - just as Wales did in the last Six Nations and as they will do again, starting with England in February, now that the various tribulations about playing style seem to have been settled. They see it as the way to a semi-final place in the 2007 World Cup, knowing they will get nowhere if they try to out-muscle the likes of England and France. According to Scott Johnson, the Wales skills coach, the four Welsh regional sides have happily bought into this style of rugby because there is no fear of relegation in the principality and they can afford to experiment. He believes that as a result the national team will be even slicker and more able to up the pace of a game in a style they are now identified with. Unfortunately for the Ospreys, reality returned after half-time and they came down to earth with a bump. Either they ran out of puff or Leicester asserted themselves, because the Welsh suddenly had no ball to run with. The bigger English forwards began brushing the defence aside - a style long identified with England This Sunday, however, Ospreys will be at home in their fine new Swansea stadium and they could, just could, last the pace rather better with the crowd behind them. Will I be there? Afraid not. I'm using my new-found freedom to take my son to Indianapolis. Tonight we are at the basketball watching the Indiana Pacers, before going to see whether the Colts can extend their winning run to 14 in the NFL."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
