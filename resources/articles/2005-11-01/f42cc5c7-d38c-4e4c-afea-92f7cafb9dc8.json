It seems now that he was wrong. He is expected to be left out of England's starting line-up for the friendly match with Argentina tomorrow and, though he has missed games before, including the fixture with Poland last month, this is a landmark absence. Never before has Sven-Goran Eriksson dumped him among the substitutes. Campbell will not delude himself either that he is being rested from an inconsequential fixture. The manager himself has been adamant about the need to make the most of the test Argentina will pose, particularly since England need to brush up on the sort of tactics they could have to use at the World Cup finals next summer. Campbell commented demurely this week that he could not consider himself an automatic choice but he did not expect to have the accuracy of his opinion confirmed with brusqueness. The disappointment stretches beyond the immediate context of the Argentina game. At 31 he appreciates that his removal can be interpreted as a changing of the guard, with Rio Ferdinand, 27, and John Terry, 24, sealing the centre-back partnership. It is obvious that Campbell is showing signs of age. He was bedevilled by ankle and achilles problems for much of this year and was forced to leave the World Cup qualifier with Austria in October after 65 minutes because of a tight hamstring. Amateur physiologists in the stands also ask whether his sheer size and power imposes strains that muscles and joints are no longer so ready to bear. Nonetheless this judgment by Eriksson does not feel natural. Time might be stealing up on Campbell but other problems have pounced on Ferdinand. In the most shaming moment of the manager's time with England, when Northern Ireland defeated England 1-0 at Windsor Park in September, David Healy was free to score as the Manchester United player had failed to spring the off-side trap. Not even the most partisan of Ferdinand's admirers could call that a rare lapse without blushing. Eriksson would definitely not embarrass himself by being associated with such a claim. The Swede has made it clear that Ferdinand's form has been unsatisfactory and that, indeed, was why Campbell was picked ahead of him to take on Austria last month. Eriksson has been slow, too, to change his mind. \"He will be in Germany for sure,\" said the manager of Ferdinand just an hour before United's match with Chelsea last Sunday. \"It's up to him to show he should be on the field as well.\" No one supposed that Ferdinand could justify himself quite so quickly as he appears to have done. His eventual rehabilitation has been widely anticipated but many felt it might have been delayed in salutary fashion until the spring. Cheering as Manchester United fans found their 1-0 win over Chelsea, Ferdinand was not exactly a revelation. While he eventually made his contribution to the clean sheet, there was the stark early image of his unresponsiveness as Frank Lampard hit a 40-yard pass and Didier Drogba burst in behind him. Eriksson may have been swayed by the evidence of this week's practice matches but he could also have found himself admitting that the easier movement of Ferdinand is a quality he cannot continue to ignore. Once the United centre-half and Campbell complemented one another beautifully with their contrasting attributes, as the 2002 World Cup showed, but now the manager must pick between them because leaving out Terry is no longer a serious possibility. His choice must have reverberations. Campbell, after all, has played with distinction through every minute of England's 16 matches in the last four major championships. Ferdinand, on the other hand, was not at Euro 2004 because of the ban imposed for a missed drugs test. If a responsible attitude were the clincher, Campbell would be undroppable. It is not. Eriksson's mind is presumably swarming with other factors. Should Campbell have struck him as at all creaky or should some physiological concerns about the Spurs' centre-back have arisen, it might have been enough to drive him to action. The manager could even have reviewed the bad passing and questionable defending from Campbell in Arsenal's recent draw at Spurs. The simplest conclusion of all is that Eriksson realised Ferdinand was indispensable for the World Cup finals and saw no sense in excluding him. If the logic is as basic as that, all of Campbell's resolve will not suffice to wrest back his status."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
