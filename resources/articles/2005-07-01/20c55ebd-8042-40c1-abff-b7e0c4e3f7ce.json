After all it is not every day that a player with a bit of previous form in head-banging behaviour gets involved in a bar-room brawl on his club's pre-season tour of Thailand. Allegedly giving a 15-year-old Everton fan what is euphemistically known as \"a livener\" before chomping on one of his intervening team-mate's fingers as he tried to intervene is undeniably interesting, especially when one's manager is that shrinking violet Stuart Pearce. Oh to have been within earshot of the Manchester City manager as he ordered Barton home while offering the choice observation that it might not have been a bad thing had the player spent a night in one of Thailand's notorious jails. And the back pages might also have made more of Sir Clive Woodward's imminent move to Southampton as their director of football, God help them. Poor old Harry Redknapp has been forced to sell just about everyone on the books capable of kicking a football and now he sees the once great rugby union coach going on the payroll, seemingly with the power to stick his nose into club affairs at all levels. No wonder Redknapp is said to be considering his future, because it looks very much from the outside as if he has been backed by his chairman Rupert Lowe into a position that is well nigh untenable. Even the posturing in the transfer market by Chelsea and Newcastle United is barely a sideshow to the big footballing story of the weekend: the apparent eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation and subsequent fall-out between Sir Alex Ferguson and his trusted club captain and sergeant-at-arms Roy Keane that has seemingly left the volatile Irishman training with the juniors back in Manchester, recovering from a hamstring injury, while the senior players complete a lucrative eight-day trip to Hong Kong, China and Japan. Now that would have been a row to have paid good money to see. Imagine the scene. Keane, veins throbbing, tells a purple-faced Fergie that a training get-together in Portugal has been a waste of time (add expletives wherever you wish for realism), while the veteran manager blows his top with seismic reverberation, showing that famed managerial skill he has tried and tested over the years (grunt and growl in the manner of a Braveheart extra with similar recourse to expletives and you would not be too far off the mark). There was only going to be one winner. Keane might have a fearsome temper, especially when it seems arrangements in Portugal were deemed unsuitable for his family, but Ferguson is the master. And, with the new season rapidly approaching, it is somehow gratifying to know that the old hairdryer is still being cranked up in time-honoured fashion. The \"Fergie bust-up with Keane\" headlines will have legs before the inevitable reconciliation. But the spat should give Ferguson time to consider the future and mull over what has been apparent to students of United's fortunes for at least two seasons and possibly longer, that Keane is past his sell-by date at the age of 33 and should have been eased out of United's first-choice team. It is one of sport's oldest truisms that once a competitor starts talking in terms of retirement, that player is already partly retired. In the act of acceptance that a glorious career is nearing its end, the player has already recognised that he is not the man he once was. Perhaps his words speak of a desire \"to go out at the top\" but the reality is somewhat different, however he might delude himself. And so it is with Keane. He concedes openly that he cannot get around the pitch as he once did and that he will, in all probability, take his bow after playing for the Republic of Ireland in the World Cup finals next summer. And so, it seems, he is on a farewell tour of duty. The pride is still there and the competitive spirit may still burn but Keane must know in his heart that he is looking ever more like an old nightclub singer who remembers all the tunes and all the words, but somehow cannot quite hit the notes any more. It is Ferguson's reluctance to confront the Keane issue that has been at the root of United's relative lack of success and inability to compete in the league last season at the same level as Chelsea. \"We keep talking about trying to find someone but you are not going to find another Roy Keane,\" Ferguson was saying for the umpteenth time last week. But he must have serious reservations about how many match-winning performances might be coaxed out of the Irishman's ageing body this season and, unless he can persuade Malcolm Glazer to make funds available to buy a new dynamic presence in the United midfield, there is no reason to think United will get any closer to Chelsea this season and they could quite possibly be forced to watch from even further back as Jose Mourinho's team disappears over the horizon. Sir Alex has spoken of the possibility of his striker Alan Smith shaping up to run the midfield. \"He is still only 24; he's a young lad. Perhaps in time he could become a replacement for Roy Keane,\" he said, and who am I to doubt that he can persuade Smith - with or without hairdryer - that his future lies in a crucial central-midfield role? The problem is that Ferguson may not have time on his side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
