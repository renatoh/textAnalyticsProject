The Finland international was signed on a free transfer from Barcelona two years ago but has made only 26 league appearances since moving to Merseyside, scoring five times. \"I really wanted more out of this move but when you are not playing it is difficult to remain enthusiastic,\" said Litmanen, who suffered the same problem at Barcelona where he was frozen out of the first team after playing only 21 games in two years. \"If I look at the last two seasons I have to admit that it has not made me a happy person. Liverpool might have a problem keeping everyone happy at the club if they are not playing regularly. I would really like to play a bigger part in our championship race. \"It is purely the manager's choice and he does not explain why I'm not getting in. All I hear is that 'we have a big squad and everybody will play some games',\" said the 31-year-old, who is recovering from a knee injury. \"I know that Michael Owen and Emile Heskey are first-choice players, but if one of them was not playing last season it was either Robbie Fowler or Nicolas Anelka who would play. [G\u00e9rard] Houllier is the boss and at Liverpool nobody argues with him. I will not either. I just have to accept my situation, even if it makes me miserable at times.\" With the \u00a33.2m signing of Milan Baros last season and the arrival of El-Hadji Diouf for \u00a310m this summer, Litmanen had been expected to return to Ajax, where he scored 90 goals in 159 appearances in a seven-year spell that ended with his move to the Nou Camp in 1999. However, a failure to agree personal terms scuppered that deal, leaving him facing another season flitting between the bench and the reserves. \"I don't think Liverpool expected me still to be here,\" he said. \"They expected every player to turn up for pre-season training except me. I have to accept that I will probably be here for another 12 months, as I can see no solution to the problem.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
