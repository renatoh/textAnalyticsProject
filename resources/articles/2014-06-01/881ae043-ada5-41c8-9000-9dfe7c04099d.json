Bergdahl, 28, was captured by the Taliban after he disappeared from his post in Paktika province, Afghanistan, in 2009. He arrived at the San Antonio Military Medical Facility on Fort Sam Houston on Friday morning, after spending 12 days at a military hospital in Germany. Army officials said Bergdahl had not yet spoken to his parents, and that his family was not in Texas. In a statement read by army officials at the press conference the Bergdahls, who live in Idaho, declined to say whether they would travel to Texas. The New York Times reported that Bergdahl has spoken with a long-time friend, a woman named Kim, in a brief phone conversation. While Bergdahl is at the medical facility, he will receive daily medical and mental-health treatment. There is no set timeline for reintegration, as treatment is dependent on his progress and decisions. Colonel Bradley Poppen, one of the officers who spoke at the press conference, said soldiers who are reintegrating after being in captivity are treated as normal people who have had to come up with coping mechanisms to deal with their situation, and need help returning to their previous way of life. \u201cOur goal is to help [reintegration subjects] understand how what was functional at that time is not functional now,\u201d Poppen said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see them as pathologically damaged.\u201d Fox News reported on Friday that Bergdahl may have been held in solitary confinement for as long as two years, and \u201cdid not see another human face\u201d during that time. The military has attempted to keep Bergdahl out of the media spotlight since his release, and officials said he was not aware of the controversy surrounding the deal that secured his return, which involved the release of five Taliban fighters from detention at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \u201cWe expose them more and more to events around them,\u201d said Poppen. \u201cAt some point in time he\u2019ll be exposed to the media inquiries on him.\u201d The Pentagon said in a statement that a \u201ccomprehensive review into the circumstances of his disappearance and captivity\u201d is being conducted. The answers that the review comes up with will also determine whether Bergdahl receives the $300,000 in back pay he is owed for the time he spent in captivity. If he is declared to have been a prisoner of war, he could receive another $300,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
