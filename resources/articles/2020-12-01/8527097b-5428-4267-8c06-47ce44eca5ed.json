Saturday week marks the second anniversary of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s appointment as caretaker. During his tenure he has been periodically under pressure regarding his role, the latest occasion coming after Tuesday\u2019s exit from the Champions League. Solskj\u00e6r was asked before Saturday\u2019s derby against Manchester City how he deals with the spotlight. \u201cThat\u2019s something I had to think about when I accepted the role,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I have what it takes to be in such a situation? Can you handle setbacks? Can you handle success? I think I can. \u201cI\u2019ve got a fantastic staff around me who I use as sparring partners for discussions - even the conversation with the club [executive] goes on all the time. It\u2019s a continuous open dialogue. When you come to work the next day you see the quality of the players you have and you want to work with them.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r believes United have the \u201cpenetration and consistency\u201d critics claim they lack and is pleased with the side\u2019s direction. \u201cI feel we\u2019re getting better and better and looking more like a Man United team that I want with fast attackers, with dynamism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good players and individual quality that can create magic out of nothing \u2013 that\u2019s always been the way at Man United. But we can see more of the penetration and consistency everyone says we don\u2019t have. We\u2019ve won last four in the league which has become a good run and hopefully that continues.\u201d Despite the Champions League disappointment, Solskjaer pointed to this as part of United\u2019s improvement under him. \u201cIt\u2019s been a step up from last season when we played in the Europa League,\u201d he said. \u201cThose six [group] games have been great in testing levels because we played against two top teams, one who were finalists [Paris Saint-Germain] and one semi-finalist [Leipzig] last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve learnt any small mistake will get punished; we were very close to going through in a very good group. That shows me a team moving forward from barely beating Rochdale [last year on penalties in the Carabao Cup], and we struggled to beat Astana and Partizan [in the Europa League] convincingly. We still have a little bit of a way to go of course to compete and go and win the Champions League because that\u2019s our aim: to win trophies, be contenders.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r gave David de Gea his support after the goalkeeper appeared to shirk challenging Justin Kluivert as the winger scored Leipzig\u2019s decisive third. \u201cHe\u2019s a man that we really rely on and hopefully he\u2019s not affected by criticism and I don\u2019t think he will be,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
