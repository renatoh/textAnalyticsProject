The Bolivian newspaper P\u00e1gina Siete reported that Morales would cross from Argentina into the southern border town of Villaz\u00f3n on Monday morning before heading 600 miles north to the province of Chapare. Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, who was driven into exile last November in what supporters called a US-backed coup, plans to arrive in the town of Chimor\u00e9 on Tuesday, exactly a year after fleeing the same location on a Mexican airforce jet. The return of Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president comes after his Movement for Socialism (Mas) reclaimed the presidency last month when Morales\u2019 former finance minister, Luis Arce, won a landslide election victory. The former coca farmer, who led Bolivia from 2006 to 2019, has been living in Buenos Aires since Argentina\u2019s government granted him asylum last year. Arce will take office on Sunday, 24 hours before Morales\u2019 return, with the guest list including leftist regional leaders such as Argentina\u2019s president, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, and the Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. For Morales, 61, the homecoming is a chance to celebrate a remarkable political revival by Mas and make a powerful statement about his own political relevance in a profoundly symbolic region. \u201cIt\u2019s really the equivalent of Trump going into Nebraska and Oklahoma to have campaign rallies,\u201d said Jim Shultz, a Bolivia specialist. The Argentinian newspaper P\u00e1gina/12 said Morales aides were billing the \u201ccaravan\u201d to the Chapare as a \u201chistoric journey\u201d that would conclude with a \u201cgreat ceremony of welcome and thanks to the people\u201d. The Mas senator Leonardo Loza told Argentina\u2019s RadioCut that followers were preparing a \u201chistoric gathering\u201d in Chimor\u00e9 to which he hoped up to 1.5 million supporters would flock from across Bolivia. \u00c1lvaro Ruiz, the head of the pro-Mas Federation of Municipal Associations of Bolivia, told reporters: \u201cHe will be coming back with the same strength and the same hope.\u201d Shultz saw an intensely personal side to Morales\u2019s journey home. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s miserable being outside Bolivia. I\u2019m sure he misses the people, the attention, the food \u2026 on a personal level I\u2019m sure he\u2019s ecstatic to be coming home.\u201d But many, even within Morales\u2019s party, are thought to be uneasy about the reappearance of a charismatic but deeply divisive figure whose reluctance to give up power contributed to the turmoil that engulfed the South American country after last year\u2019s disputed election. Shultz said it was unclear whether Morales would be content to take a backseat role in politics or aspired to be \u201ca behind-the-scenes kingmaker telling underlings how to run the country\u201d. \u201cThe question is whether all we are looking at is somebody rebuilding their personal reputation and reconnecting with their support base, or whether we are looking at the opening of an alternative power base within the Mas \u2026 No one knows the answer to that question.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
