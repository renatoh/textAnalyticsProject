His few friends would describe him as cantankerous, tight-fisted, mean-spirited and misanthropic, and that's without even breaking open the thesaurus. He has two topics of conversation: the awfulness of the modern world and the wonder of his own talent. His wife left him long ago, and his kids have nothing to do with him. Yet the new series of Ed Reardon's Week (11.30am, Radio 4) finds him cohabiting and more or less content. Still more remarkably, the woman sharing his bed - the crime writer Mary Potter - knows what he's like, and briefly went out with him before. Will they still be together at the end of this episode? Especially once Ed's cat sticks his paw in? Christopher Douglas and Andrew Nickolds's comedy stars Douglas, Stephanie Cole, John Fortune and Sally Grace. If you're after something less trivial, you won't do better than Alice Walker's moving story The Color Purple (10.45am and repeated, Radio 4). Nadine Marshall plays Celie, the young woman abused first by her father and then by her husband."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
