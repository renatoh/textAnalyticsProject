Retaining their poise and refusing to be provoked into retaliation, Phil Neville\u2019s side won their fourth game out of four, scored three goals and kept another clean sheet. So far so good but Norway scouts separating England\u2019s performance from the Cameroonian farce dominating the headlines will have been left with cause for quiet optimism. Neville\u2019s defence looked shaky at times and appeared consistently vulnerable to long balls and pace. Alex Greenwood scored but got away with a few bad mistakes at left-back, Millie Bright did not always convince alongside the impressive Steph Houghton at centre-half, Fran Kirby sporadically struggled to retain possession in the playmaker role behind Ellen White, and Toni Duggan frequently laboured on the left flank. It seems the French media has fallen more than a little in love with Neville and his team\u2019s composure in the face of such appalling behaviour. Yet it is one thing to draw deserved plaudits for a forthright but measured deconstruction of Cameroon as well as their coach\u2019s behaviour, and quite another to convince everyone that England really are as good as their statistics suggest. Granted, some of their short passing triangles were easy on the eye but, goals apart, they did not create that many chances against a chaotic backline vastly inferior to Norway\u2019s defence. One player almost exempt from criticism is Jill Scott, who in making her 18th World Cup appearance overtook Peter Shilton\u2019s long-standing record. She is the midfielder who, in disrupting opposition attacks and linking play superbly, joins the dots for Neville\u2019s side. At her fourth World Cup, the Manchester City stalwart is a player who invariably appears to have been there, done that and bought the T-shirt \u2013 or at least until Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be in another game like that,\u201d said Scott. \u201cThere were a lot of incidents and a lot of protests. It kind of had everything, to be honest. I think one thing that I\u2019m proud of is how logical this England team stayed and how we just focused on the next moment that we could control. I thought we did that fantastically well. \u201cWe knew it was going to be physical and there were obviously a few rough challenges. I think Cameroon probably knew we were going to be too good for them technically so they played the more physical game you\u2019ve seen.\u201d Bright proved similarly restrained in her assessment of an extraordinary match which drew a peak BBC audience of 6.9m, a UK record for women\u2019s football, and 40.5% audience share. Yet despite such understatement the subtext was clear. Referring to Cameroon apparently contemplating a walk-off after disagreeing with VAR decisions, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my career that I\u2019ve experienced anything like that. I was thinking, \u2018Get on with it.\u2019\u201d At one point Houghton seemed set to try to mediate, serving as an arbiter between the referee and Cameroon, but Neville almost went ballistic, urging his captain to stay out of it. Bright agreed it was sound advice. \u201cWe just have to stay in our little bubble and let the referees do their job,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought we did that really well. That\u2019s what you have got to do in those situations. As soon as you get caught up in things, or get worried about it, you will lose momentum in the game. We stayed away from it and ignored it.\u201d Not that an England side who came away nursing some heavy bruises were exactly shrinking violets. \u201cWe pride ourselves on winning the battle,\u201d Bright said. \u201cYou win the physical battle first and then you win the football. If you try to do the football first and not the physical stuff, that doesn\u2019t work. You win physically, you get momentum and you get a foot in the game by winning your tackles and being dominant in that area. Then you can start to make your passes. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve played against Cameroon and it was quite an experience \u2013 but I\u2019ve never been bullied on a football pitch and I wasn\u2019t going to let it happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
