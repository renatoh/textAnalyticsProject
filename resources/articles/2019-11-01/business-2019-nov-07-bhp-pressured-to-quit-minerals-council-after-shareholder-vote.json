The resolution, put forward by the activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility at BHP\u2019s annual meeting in Sydney on Thursday, calls on the miner to quit industry bodies that have a long-term track record at odds with the company\u2019s support of emissions reduction. While the resolution did not pass, Thursday\u2019s vote builds on the result achieved by the ACCR at a similar shareholder meeting last month in London, which gathered 22% of the vote. BHP is set to announce whether it will leave the MCA within two months, with its chairman, Ken MacKenzie, telling the Sydney meeting the company\u2019s review of its membership of industry associations would be finished by the end of the year. \u201cIf we see that there is misalignment between an industry association and our position, then we will act,\u201d he said. He pointed out that BHP quit the World Coal Association over its position on the Paris agreement, which commits governments to action to hold global heating to below 2C. \u201cIn other cases, we work within,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see ourselves as a force for good.\u201d ACCR executive director Brynn O\u2019Brien told MacKenzie the issue was \u201cnot going away\u201d. \u201cWill I need to come back for this dance again next year, asking the same questions?\u201d she asked. MacKenzie said that \u201cindustry associations provide a range of benefits that are not recognised in the resolution\u201d, including the opportunity for BHP to lead the development of new standards covering issues including the environment. And he stressed the company\u2019s \u201creal commitment\u201d to fighting the climate crisis, which includes spending US$400m to reduce BHP\u2019s emissions, the reduction of so-called \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions made by its customers and linking executive pay to environmental results. On preliminary figures, 29.58% of shares at the Sydney meeting were voted in favour of the ACCR\u2019s resolution, which had the backing of shareholders including Vision Super, tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, the UK\u2019s biggest listed fund manager, Standard Life Aberdeen, and an important industry super fund adviser, the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors. Over almost four hours, shareholders also peppered MacKenzie and the chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, with questions over issues including dust pollution caused by its mines, its decision to set up an in-house labour hire firm, the deadly Samarco mine disaster and its involvement with a project to explore for copper and gold in an area close to the dangerous border with Colombia. Many questions focused on the operations and future of the Mount Arthur coal mine in NSW, which fuels a power plant, Liddell, that is set to close in 2023 unless it gets a government bailout. Andrew Mackenzie said he expected the mine to keep operating for decades but kept open the option of selling it. He said BHP had \u201cno immediate plans to invest in it because of the dwindling or relatively low rate of growth of demand\u201d for thermal coal as the world decarbonises. Martin Rush, the mayor of nearby Muswellbrook, told the meeting children in the area were getting sick from coal dust spewed out by the mine, which broke environmental laws eight times in seven years. He invited the board to \u201ccome to Muswellbrook\u201d to see the effect on the local community. \u201cI want to be proud of BHP \u2013 we are not now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re better than that.\u201d Ken MacKenzie said cutting down on dust was \u201ca focus area for us\u201d. \u201cWe want to be a good corporate citizen,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
