Born in Texas and now based in New Mexico, he's a painter and sculptor involved in theatrical projects, and a singer-songwriter whose unique work has been covered by everyone from Little Feat to David Byrne. Amazingly, this is his first new studio album in 14 years, but it sounds as relaxed, intimate and gently startling as anything he has recorded. Queenie's Song, a lament for a shot dog, is a bleak attack on the gun lobby (\"you must have got a gun for Christmas\"), while Hold On to the House deals with love and real estate, and Emergency Human Blood Courier presents a nightmare vision of the Mexican border. Then there's a relaxed horror story, The Gift, and the black humour of Do They Dream of Hell in Heaven. No one else writes country songs like these."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
