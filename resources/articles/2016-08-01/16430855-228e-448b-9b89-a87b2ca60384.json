Barnum, a man who knew a thing or two about putting on a show, once said \u201cclowns are the pegs on which the circus is hung\u201d. For football in the 1980s the show seemed to be hung on characters and showmen \u2013 from the unhinged antics of Mark Jackson through to Dermott Brereton\u2019s parody of every rock-star swagger from Elvis to Jagger. Like Stephen Sondheim in A Little Night Music, the game\u2019s commentators last week lamentably asked themselves where are the clowns \u2013 the characters and the showmen \u2013 after Collingwood\u2019s Dane Swan hung up his boots. In many ways the game has never been better, the irony being that as it has improved and become more professional, footballers are being scrutinised years before they even enter the league. They are told not to be reckless on the field or off it, and that they must define themselves, always, as part of a team. You are expected to fold yourself into a character. One who can be drafted. \u201cI\u2019m an individual!\u201d Well, you\u2019re not fooling anybody. But those suggesting we won\u2019t see the like of if not Swan, then certainly Brereton, again simply aren\u2019t casting their eyes wide enough. In the supermarket of football opinion, it is not the most wobble-wheeled of carts that contains the suggestion that the next Brereton may be a woman. If you want proof, head out under the lights at the Whitten Oval on Saturday night, where the women\u2019s all-stars match will be at the centre of football\u2019s gravity and the only show in town. One of the players to feature will be Moana Hope. What Collingwood lost in Swan last week, they more than replaced a month ago in Hope, one of their two marquee signings for the upcoming AFL women\u2019s league. Collingwood\u2019s newest tattooed forward has 14 siblings and a history as a state-level cricketer. When she kicked her 100th goal for the season last week with the St Kilda Sharks, members of her family stormed the ground and performed a haka. The game will also feature midfielder Lauren Arnell, who was not only Carlton\u2019s first priority pick, but also their first female football ambassador who is working to develop the women\u2019s game in Melbourne\u2019s north. A man who not only knows Arnell well, but also the women\u2019s game, is Graham Burgen. Burgen is the head coach of the Victorian Women\u2019s Football League Academy and in October, will take the role of Carlton women\u2019s team\u2019s inaugural list manager and midfield coach. Burgen is also no stranger to the times when the game\u2019s pegs were characters and showmen, having plied his trade in the VFA during the 1980s against Port Melbourne\u2019s Fred Cooke and \u201cBuster\u201d Harland. Burgan has seen more women\u2019s footy than most and loves what he sees. \u201cI\u2019ve been out to hundreds of games all across Victoria and interstate, and the skills of the game are first class,\u201d says Burgen. \u201cOnce they get to play on a bigger stage and exposed to a larger audience, the public is going to love it \u2013 and the women who play it.\u201d Much to the delight of Burgen, one of those women has already been drafted by Carlton. Brianna Davey is a team-mate of Hope\u2019s at St Kilda Sharks and is the AFL women\u2019s competition\u2019s first high-profile code-hopper, having previously kept goal for both the Matildas and Melbourne City. \u201cBrianna Davey could be as good as anyone in the competition in a couple of years,\u201d says Burgen. \u201cThey can\u2019t tackle her and she\u2019ll bust out of a clearance with four women hanging off her. She\u2019s really exciting.\u201d And there is exciting talent everywhere he looks, including another potential code-hopper in Cecilia McIntosh who represented Australia in the bobsled in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, having previously won a silver medal in the javelin at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. \u201cC-bomb is an excitement machine,\u201d says Burgen of McIntosh. \u201cSomething is always happening when she\u2019s near the ball. There\u2019s also Emma Kearney who will line up for the Bulldogs on Saturday night. In the likely event she\u2019ll be drafted into the AFL women\u2019s league, she\u2019ll need to balance football with opening the bowling in the women\u2019s cricket Big Bash competition. Those women drafted into the league will not only be talented footballers, they will be physical footballers also. After the success of the women\u2019s rugby sevens team in Brazil, those who think that women\u2019s sport is neither entertaining nor physical must be of such an archaic, misogynist mindset that they still believe you can decide if someone is a witch by seeing if she floats. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl called Lauren Tesoriero from the Eastern Devils who\u2019s got a bit of character about her \u2013 she likes knocking girls down and there\u2019s usually a bit of carnage in her vicinity,\u201d says Burgen. \u201cAll the defenders are looking over their shoulder when she\u2019s coming.\u201d As a footballer with the Darebin reserves, Alison Smirnoff is not expecting her name to be called on draft night, but as the founder of Change Her Game, an online movement that aims to positively raise the profile of women in sport, can\u2019t wait to see how the inaugural competition plays out. \u201cA lot of the women that will be drafted for next year are women that are in their mid- to late-20s, some in their early 30s,\u201d says Smirnoff. \u201cThey also have broader life experience in that they\u2019ve had to fit footy around their job, so they\u2019re vastly different from the TAC Cup footballer that comes into the AFL system.\u201d Smirnoff believes this provides clubs with a great opportunity to engage an audience beyond the important demographic of female members and supporters. A lot of the women will have amazing backstories \u2013 Moana Hope gets up at three in the morning most days to start work, so she can take her sister Vinny, who has the rare neurological disorder, M\u00f6bius syndrome, to school \u2013 and they are not just remarkable athletes, but incredible people. \u201cGiven clubs want people coming through the gates, their stories should be told and their individuality encouraged,\u201d says Smirnoff. \u201cIn the future, we may reach the level of the men\u2019s game with similar pathways, but for now the point of difference should be celebrated.\u201d As well as characters, the aesthetics of women\u2019s football is likely to be a drawcard. Rather than the AFL tampering with the rules, Burgen believes in a simpler approach to make the game more free-flowing. \u201cI want to see the game blossom, so I\u2019d be pushing for 16-a-side, rather than any rule changes,\u201d says Burgen. \u201cBecause if the girls are taking hangers, running, bouncing and kicking goals, everyone\u2019s going to go, \u2018this is fantastic, I\u2019m going to watch this\u2019.\u201d Tinkering with the rules too much, could risk the league being perceived to take a patronising view of the women\u2019s game, something Burgen believes is not required. \u201cHaving coached both men and women, I can comfortably say that to me it\u2019s no different. I just coach footballers,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there is a difference with women, it\u2019s that they can improve their footy IQ really quickly as they\u2019ve not had years and years of being exposed to top-level coaching. So if you\u2019ve an intelligent player, you\u2019ll give her something, watch her do it and when it works you\u2019ll see her smile and she\u2019ll run back to you and say, \u2018what else ya\u2019 got?\u2019\u201d Burgen says he has up to 150 women on speed dial seeking his feedback. \u201cThey\u2019ll call as ask, \u2018Did you see my game on the weekend? What do you think?\u2019 The appetite for self-improvement is enormous.\u201d There are other ways too that Burgen believes the AFL could exert a positive influence. \u201cI think it would be great that after draft night, the AFL get all the coaches together and say just let \u2018em play.\u201d And once they play, the fans will come. \u201cThe most exciting thing for me is that it is not a gimmick,\u201d says Smirnoff. \u201cThe clubs are 100% invested in growing the women\u2019s game.\u201d And the more access that young girls have to sports can only be a good thing. \u201cAs a kid my football idols were Stephen Silvagni and Brett Ratten. But now little girls will be able to look up to Darcy Vescio, Moana Hope, Katie Brennan or Daisy Pearce.\u201d The women\u2019s game has the potential to be many things \u2013 skilful, fast and expressive. It should be as entertaining as hell, but the one thing it won\u2019t be is a circus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
