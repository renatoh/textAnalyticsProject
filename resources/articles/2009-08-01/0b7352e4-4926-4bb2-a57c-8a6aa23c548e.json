Anything else would have been too easy. Butterfly is the most bewildering of techniques: done properly it is supposed to take less effort than racing crawl, but few non-professionals have mastered it. The stroke depends on a strange overarm leaping, arms out and thumbs down, with most people ending up swimming half vertical, as though trying to climb out of the water. That is a mistake (and one made by Prime Minister Putin, who was also filmed on his holiday riding a horse with the reins too short). Elegant butterfly should pull the swimmer forward in a supple wave, made additionally tricky by a dolphin-like kick. Whether it is worth all the effort is open to question: in 1936 the Amateur Swimming Association even banned its use in competitive swimming, and didn't relent until 1947, not long before butterfly made a formal appearance at the Olympics. Nor is it clear who invented it. \"Of great interest to swimmers at the moment is a new stroke, reported to be becoming popular in the United States and picturesquely described as the Butterfly stroke,\" the Guardian reported in 1935, although some say it was in use by 1911. Whatever the truth, it has become one of those elusive skills that separate top swimmers, and publicity hungry prime ministers, from the rest of us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
