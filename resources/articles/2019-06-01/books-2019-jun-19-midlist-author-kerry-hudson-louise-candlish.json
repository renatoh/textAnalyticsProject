Could she continue as a writer? Or would she have to return to her old job in the charity sector? Louise Candlish had 11 novels under her belt when, a couple of years ago, she found herself considering quitting. \u201cSome of them had really flopped,\u201d she says. \u201cI had got myself into that catch-22, where your sales figures aren\u2019t as healthy as they once were or as good as retailers would like. So then your book comes out and it\u2019s not stocked in as many places, so it doesn\u2019t sell as well. Then you\u2019re writing your next one and it won\u2019t earn as much money, as they\u2019re looking at what happened to the one before. You\u2019re almost doomed to continue the pattern.\u201d With Wednesday being Dalloway Day \u2013 marking the mid-June setting of Virginia Woolf\u2019s Mrs Dalloway \u2013 a report from the Royal Society of Literature (RSL) has revealed that only 5% of writers earn the income Woolf once argued a writer needs to work. This was \u00a3500 a year in her day, now equivalent to just over \u00a330,000. But some 184,000 books are published every year in the UK and the vast majority of the authors behind them fall into what is called the \u201cmidlist\u201d \u2013 books that get little to no marketing budget but publishers deem good enough to put out, in the hope that some of them might hit the charts. Most of them won\u2019t. Candlish planned to stop after two novels received scant backing from her publisher. \u201cMeanwhile, debuts were getting these huge budgets, posters everywhere for books I thought were no better than my own, and I thought, well, this is ridiculous,\u201d she says. Despite having just won France\u2019s Prix Femina, Hudson had to apply for a Royal Literary Fund hardship grant to help her until next payment. \u201cComing from a working-class background, I don\u2019t have a credit card, I don\u2019t have family I can borrow from \u2013 there\u2019s no safety net,\u201d she says. Today, Hudson\u2019s memoir Lowborn, about growing up in poverty, is just out to positive reviews and healthy sales. Candlish moved to a new publisher for her 12th novel, Our House, which has been a bestseller and won the best thriller prize at the British book awards. Her 13th, Those People, is published in paperback this month. Neither writer is considering giving up. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard for a midlist, mid-career author to break the cycle. So much of the pot is given to the hyped debuts and the established household names. So I made a concerted effort,\u201d says Candlish, who has seen her advance double to six figures, because of the success of Our House. \u201cYou really are as good as your last sales figures. I\u2019ve often been in situations where I\u2019ve literally been scrabbling around for coins at the back of the sofa the week before getting some good news. It\u2019s gone quite close to the wire sometimes but I\u2019ve managed to keep going.\u201d This week, the All-Party Parliamentary Writers Group called on the UK government to take immediate action to reverse the steep decline in author incomes, a year after its inquiry found that writers\u2019 earnings have fallen by 42% in real terms since 2005. The tough conditions could discourage new writers, \u201cexacerbating the lack of diversity in publishing and the creative industries\u201d, the APPWG report warned \u2013 a concern echoed by Hudson and the RSL\u2019s survey, which found that of 2,000-odd writers, 25% identified as working class, but only made up 11% of the highest earners. \u201cIt excludes so many people on the other end of the spectrum,\u201d says Hudson. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss all those stories if we only have books by people who either have the freedom to devote all their time and attention to that, or who have other sources of income. All the people who need to pay the rent and the bills, they\u2019re the ones who will miss out. It will make our literary culture so much poorer because we will have such a narrow spectrum of stories.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
