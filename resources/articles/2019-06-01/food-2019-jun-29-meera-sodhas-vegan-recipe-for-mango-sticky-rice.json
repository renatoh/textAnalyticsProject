Before, I thought of myself as a mango purist (I am Indian, after all) and that nothing could beat an alphonso fresh out of the box. But I was wrong. There is something extraordinarily special about the marriage between milky, sweet coconut and delightfully chewy sticky rice that brings out the best and sunniest side of any mango. Eating it is pure joy, so make it while you can (ie, while mango season lasts). Mango sticky rice I rarely advocate buying new kitchen kit, but an inexpensive bamboo steamer is worth its weight in gold (for foolproof steamed rice, or to steam shop-bought or homemade dumplings, if nothing else). You\u2019ll also need a piece of muslin and to set aside four hours to soak the rice. Soak 4 hr Prep 5 min Cook 40 min Serves 4 200g glutinous or Thai sticky rice 200ml coconut cream 2 tbsp caster sugar \u00bc tsp salt 4 alphonso, honey or kesar mangoes 1 lime, quartered Wash the rice a couple of times in cold water, then put it in a large bowl. Add enough cold water to cover the rice, then leave it to soak for around four hours. Meanwhile, line the top layer of a bamboo steamer with muslin. Drain the soaked rice, then put it inside the steamer and, using your fingertips, even it out, so it sits in a thin layer. Wrap the sides of the muslin over the top of the rice and put the lid on the steamer. Fill the pan in which you will put the steamer with 2-3cm cold water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, carefully lower in the steamer and leave to cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender. While the rice is cooking, scrape the coconut cream into a small saucepan, add the sugar and salt, and stir to mix. Bring to a boil, then take off the heat. Peel the mangoes, cut off the four \u201ccheeks\u201d from each one (eat the rest another time, or immediately) and thinly slice each cheek. When the rice is cooked, unwrap the muslin \u2013 take care, because the steam will be very hot. Tip the rice into a bowl, and pour over all but four tablespoons of the coconut mix. Toss with a fork, then cover and put to one side for five minutes, so the rice can absorb the cream. Put the rice in four neat mounds on four plates. Arrange some mango slices on each mound, squeeze a little lime juice on top, pour a tablespoon of reserved coconut cream over each portion and serve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
