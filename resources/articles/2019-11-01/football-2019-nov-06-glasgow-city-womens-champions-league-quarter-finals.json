Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Lyon, Paris Saint-Germain, Wolfsburg, Arsenal and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the giants of women\u2019s football are all there. The eighth team, standing strong in the face of a more and more dominant European elite are Glasgow City. Who? Good question. Without a men\u2019s \u201cparent team\u201d that their Champions League bedfellows benefit from, Glasgow City cannot come close to matching the glamour and global profile of their potential opponents. But they are stalwarts of women\u2019s football. It is not City\u2019s first time in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The 14-time Scottish Women\u2019s Premier League champions reached the same stage in 2014-15, and they have got as far as the last 16 on three other occasions. But when City were last in the final eight, European women\u2019s football was at a very different stage of development. Then, the other teams through were Bristol Academy (who had been back under the wing of Bristol City for only a year after a seven-year spell of independence), PSG, the Swedish sides Roseng\u00e5rd and Link\u00f6ping, Wolfsburg and Frankfurt from Germany and Denmark\u2019s Br\u00f8ndby. The change to a last eight that \u2013 Glasgow apart \u2013 would not look out of place in the men\u2019s draw reflects the growth of women\u2019s football. That seven of the eight nations to reach the same stage of the Women\u2019s World Cup this summer were European is similarly telling. The big guns of football, in terms of leagues, clubs and national associations, are investing heavily \u2013 and it shows. The push for men\u2019s clubs to pick up the women\u2019s football banner has worked. Manchester United have entered the fold, Real Madrid have taken over CD Tac\u00f3n. In many respects it would be fair to have a tinge of sadness as the teams who pioneered the game are pushed out in favour of those who have been somewhat bullied to the table, but there is no denying the impact these football giants have on the legitimacy of women\u2019s football and the audiences they bring. Glasgow City\u2019s stunning shootout defeat of Br\u00f8ndby, who had tied the aggregate score after the Scottish club\u2019s shock 2-0 away win, leaves them flying the flag of the little guys in Europe\u2019s premier domestic competition. The goalkeeper, Lee Alexander, put in a player-of-the-match performance by saving three penalties in the shootout, perhaps helping to dull memories of Scotland\u2019s crushing single World Cup point. Five of Glasgow City\u2019s team were part of Shelley Kerr\u2019s squad in France, and three, including Alexander, are in the squad for November\u2019s international window. City stick out in many ways. Founded by the Scottish players Laura Montgomery (who still runs things as club manager) and Carol Anne Stewart in 1998, they remain unaffiliated to a men\u2019s team. Last month they secured the SWPL title for a 13th consecutive season, a feat all the more impressive given the rise of Celtic and Rangers, with the former turning professional at the start of last season and the latter upping investment significantly. The head coach, Scott Booth, who has managed the team since 2015, has to balance a squad of primarily part-time players who juggle work or studying with their football, and two professional players in Hayley Lauder and Rachel McLauchlan. As a standalone women\u2019s club full-time professionalism is out of reach at present and so their best players often graduate to clubs who can offer it. The Utah Royals defender and Scotland captain Rachel Corsie, the Arsenal defender Emma Mitchell, Chelsea\u2019s forward Erin Cuthbert and the Wales international Denise O\u2019Sullivan, an NWSL winner with North Carolina Courage, laid the foundations of their careers in Glasgow. Success in the Champions League can create its own problems. After City played Anderlecht last season, Abbi Grant (now at Birmingham) was poached by the Belgian side. After their defeat by Eskilstuna in 2016 Fiona Brown was recruited by the Swedish team. Their run in this year\u2019s competition will undoubtedly attract the scouts. Now, if Scottish football wants to continue the big strides being made, and to disrupt the European narrative, they need support. Government funding helped all members of the national squad to train full-time in the run-up to their first World Cup, in France. The \u00a3400,000 that remains from money generated by the tournament, after payment to players, is expected to be reinvested in the domestic game by the Scottish Football Association. But there is a long way to go. Lauder retweeted a photo of City\u2019s title-winning 10-0 defeat of Motherwell which was played at Wishaw Sports Centre, with the added caption: \u201cJust won a league title in a public park at a sports centre. Not how I envisaged the game in 2019. Women\u2019s football is one of the most inclusive sports and we pride ourselves on that. However, this venue was not accessible for all our fans.\u201d It was damning. And harked back to the conditions of games after women\u2019s football was banned from association grounds by the SFA, as it was in England, in 1921. Hardly fitting of a showpiece title decider. Luckily for City, a tie against one of Europe\u2019s top teams will offer a more glamorous way to continue the season. With the league wrapped up they don\u2019t have the burden of a domestic schedule on the calendar. Despite that, avoiding defeat in either leg will be a huge struggle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
