The former Ireland defender has been out of work since being sacked by Leeds this summer and was immediately installed as 5-2 favourite to manage his country after McCarthy decided to step down as Republic boss. But O'Leary insists he has no intention of moving into international management at this stage in his career. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I would love to manage my country one day but if the FAI were to approach me now I would have to decline. \"I loved the day-to-day involvement of club management and I would really like to be involved in that again first.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
