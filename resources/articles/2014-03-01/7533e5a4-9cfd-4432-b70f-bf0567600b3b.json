On the one hand, Caradog James's script packs in more ideas per square inch than every schlocky sci-fi film by Paul WS Anderson (Resident Evil) put together. On the other hand, the last act is as predictable as rain in Snowdonia. Still the good bits mostly outweigh the bad. Toby Stephens stars as a Frankenstein-like neuroscientist employed by the MoD to rebuild damaged soldiers to fight in an ongoing cold war against the Chinese. When his associate (Caity Lotz) is murdered, he builds a cyborg in her image, the machine of the title who nevertheless has a moral GPS calibrated to a much finer degree than the humans around her. James overflogs the what-is-the-nature-of-being-dead horse, but directs with brio. Meanwhile, Lotz, with her child-like fragility and snappy kickboxing moves, is eminently watchable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
