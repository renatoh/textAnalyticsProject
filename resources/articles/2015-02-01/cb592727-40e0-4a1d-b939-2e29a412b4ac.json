In a fine 22-year career that should serve as inspiration to any young footballer, Davies has history with United before Monday evening\u2019s FA Cup fifth\u2011round tie, when Louis van Gaal\u2019s side visit Preston North End. Speaking near the Macron Stadium, the home of Bolton Wanderers, one of his former clubs, Davies is relaxed after ending a 13-month scoring drought last Saturday. His winner in North End\u2019s victory over Coventry was the 150th goal of a career that began, aged 16, with Chesterfield in 1993. He will be 38 next month but first he will lead the line for the League One promotion chasers against United. It was during his decade of admirable service for Wanderers that Davies became a bete noire for Ferguson and United fans. In March 2008 the Scot cited the famous statistic about Davies making the most fouls in the Premier League \u2013 records began in 2003 and his tally was 926 when Bolton went down in 2012 \u2013 adding he would do \u201canything he possibly can to unsettle us\u201d. Davies says: \u201cIt got blown up in the press and took the edge off my game because I knew people would be watching the referee. Patrice Evra and I used to have battles and apparently he said to me: \u2018Why do you always give me such a hard time?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Because I don\u2019t like you.\u2019 But I never said that. \u201cI remember bumping into him in town. I was with my wife and I walked up to him and wouldn\u2019t let him pass me in the street. It was only a joke but he didn\u2019t seem to get it.\u201d Even away from the heat of a game, Ferguson had no time for Davies. \u201cI was at a north-west football dinner with David Moyes and he walked up and ignored me. A friend once told him he was good friends with me and Ferguson said: \u2018Don\u2019t speak to me about that boy.\u2019\u201d In September 2011, during a 5-0 home defeat, his tackle sidelined Cleverley for four weeks with an ankle injury. Davies says: \u201cThe fans are still going on about it now \u2013 a few dodgy tweets. It was just a coming together, a tackle.\u201d Davies resisted firing back. \u201cI went to tweet but no \u2013 it\u2019s a contact sport,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd in derby games, tackles will fly around. I still enjoy seeing that sort of stuff.\u201d Monday\u2019s match renews a rivalry last contested in February 1972. Then, in a fourth-round FA Cup tie, Frank O\u2019Farrell\u2019s side, led by the holy trinity of George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law, won 2-0 through two late Alan Gowling goals in front of a full house at Deepdale. This will be the 76th meeting of a local squabble that dates from 18 January 1890, when Preston trounced Newton Heath \u2013 as United were then \u2013 6-1 in the Cup. This tie is reward for knocking out Havant &amp; Waterlooville, Shrewsbury Town, Norwich City and Sheffield United. Davies says: \u201cWe have half a chance. There is a lot of excitement. People want tickets. United\u2019s a big step up but we are capable.\u201d This week one of Davies\u2019s former managers clashed with Van Gaal. Sam Allardyce, the West Ham manager, branded United \u201clong-ball\u201d for their tactics in Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw at West Ham. This moved Van Gaal to produce a dossier to argue the difference between hopeful hoofs upfield and sideways passes. Davies, whom Allardyce signed and made Bolton captain, grins. \u201cThe sideways passing stat \u2026 I have not seen that one before,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will be trying to study a way of dealing with those long sideways passes.\u201d Davies\u2019s career has taken in rejection by his boyhood club, Sheffield United, then signing for Chesterfield, a \u00a3750,000 move to Southampton in 1997, a \u00a37.5m transfer to Blackburn Rovers in June 1998, a \u00a31.2m return to the Saints the following year and a two-month loan spell at Millwall before joining Bolton on a free transfer. Considering his 330 Premier League starts for Wanderers, Davies proved a particular bargain. There have been two disappointing yet memorable FA Cup experiences, both ending in the semi-finals, most recently in 2011. Under Owen Coyle, Davies led a Bolton thrashed 5-0 by Stoke City. \u201cA real low point,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are captain of a club, with the chance to get to the final and try to lift the trophy, it\u2019s what you dream of.\u201d In 1997 Davies was in the Chesterfield team that went 2-0 up after an hour of an epic game against a Middlesbrough side that featured Fabrizio Ravanelli, Juninho and Emerson but had Vladimir Kinder sent off in the first half \u2013 his second booking was for a foul on Davies. After a Jonathan Howard \u201cgoal\u201d that crossed the line but was not awarded when Chesterfield led 2-1, Bryan Robson\u2019s side went 3-2 ahead in extra time before Jamie Hewitt\u2019s last\u2011gasp equaliser forced a replay. At Hillsborough, Chesterfield lost 3-0. \u201cIt was probably the greatest semi-final there ever was. It had absolutely everything but at the same time we felt robbed,\u201d Davies says. \u201cThroughout that first game you went through every kind of emotion, a sending-off, penalties, 2-0 up, 3-2 down, disallowed goal, last-minute equaliser. Physically draining.\u201d Now Davies, who may play on next season, hopes to make United struggle. \u201cCambridge and Yeovil gave them problems [in earlier rounds] and the cameras will be at Preston for a reason,\u201d he says. \u201cOn our day we are capable of giving them problems. We can raise the game hopefully and make it difficult. It\u2019s a big chance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
