Arconic, which made the cladding sheets that were the main cause of the fire\u2019s spread, obtained a certificate for its plastic-filled panels on \u201ca false premise\u201d by supplying test reports for a more fire-retardant version of the product, lawyers for the bereaved and survivors told the inquiry. Celotex, which made the bulk of the combustible foam insulation used, displayed a \u201cwidespread culture \u2026 of ignoring compliance\u201d, which included distorting a full-scale fire test of its materials, the inquiry heard. And Kingspan, which made the rest of the insulation, carried out tests that involved either \u201cconcealing components in a manner designed to facilitate a pass and/or using materials that were not as described in the test reports,\u201d it was claimed. Internal emails from the firm revealed it knew it was \u201cdodgy\u201d for it to advertise that its material could be used on tall buildings above 18 metres. \u201cIt was all too clear that the companies were untroubled by the safety of their products and some of them remain so despite the disastrous fire,\u201d said Stephanie Barwise QC, as the latest stage of the inquiry opened. Representing many of the bereaved and survivors, Barwise said it was \u201csinister\u201d that the manufacturers understood the fire regulations but \u201csought to circumvent it by clever marketing\u201d. Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan went out of their way to advertise their products as having the safest ratings for fire spread even though their materials did not have that classification, she added. The three companies strongly dispute the claims against them. In its opening statement, Arconic said the main fault lay with those responsible for the refurbishment. Its employees were in no way \u201cseeking to exploit the UK market place\u201d, it said, as it pointed out that the insulation, made by others, appeared to have caught fire first. Celotex said Arconic had misled the market about the safety of its panels. It also accused the construction professionals of failing to follow building regulations, and the council\u2019s building control officer of incompetence. Kingspan blamed Arconic\u2019s panels and said the outcome of the fire would have been no different if non-combustible insulation had been used. It emerged that key executives from Arconic are refusing to appear before the inquiry, which Barwise said bereaved and survivors would \u201cstruggle to comprehend, given their need to understand Arconic\u2019s role in the disaster\u201d. Three executives of the company, based in France, are refusing to attend, citing a French law that has been used once in its 51-year existence to prosecute French nationals who provide evidence and company documents in foreign legal processes. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, said: \u201cIt is hard to think that the French prosecutor would wish to punish those individuals for giving evidence before a public inquiry \u2026 looking into a notorious fire in which so many were killed.\u201d Natasha Elcock, a survivor of the fire and chair of the Grenfell United families group, said the community was \u201coutraged\u201d at the move. Grenfell United is calling on the French government to lift any threat of prosecution. The latest stage in the inquiry will examine the manufacturing, testing and sale of the materials used in the council block refurbishment that resulted in the fire in June 2017 that claimed 72 lives. In her opening statement, Barwise said Kingspan and Celotex \u201cabused\u201d the testing system and carried out fire tests of materials that involved either \u201cconcealing components in a manner designed to facilitate a pass and/or using materials that were not as described in the test reports\u201d. This included adding fire retardants to materials in order to slow down ignition . She concluded with a warning that \u201cthe manufacturers are in general not humbled by the Grenfell fire, and their behaviours are not altered by it.\u201d The inquiry continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
