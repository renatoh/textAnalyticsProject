It was evening on a quiet east London street, and I was to accompany Evans on a mudlarking expedition, to scour the banks of the Thames at low-tide, searching for small treasures. On her Instagram she posts vivid pictures of the silver spoons, cut-glass bottle stoppers and delicate beads she\u2019s unearthed, the hashtags revealing a mudlarking community that stretches the length of the river. I looked up at the restaurant, perplexed. It was only when I got to the door that the alley to the right was revealed through a heavy, rusted gate. As I started down slippery steps the smell of the river, coppery and green, was suddenly overwhelming. And then I was there, on the beach, and a small figure by the water was waving. Evans is an art historian and has been a devoted mudlarker since before she learned the word. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hobby,\u201d she told me, firmly, \u201cit\u2019s an obsession.\u201d Now 39, she grew up by the river in Putney, southwest London, where she\u2019d spend afternoons picking up pieces of colourful pottery and clay pipes. It wasn\u2019t until she saw them displayed at Hampton Court Palace that she learned what they were. Today, she comes to the river after work, or with her five-year-old daughter at weekends. Perhaps it\u2019s because Cecilia\u2019s closer to the ground, Evans suggests, that she finds the best things. A coke can covered in sand was a reminder that the river is still and has long been a dumping ground for Londoners\u2019 rubbish, making it one of the most varied archaeological sites in the world. The 19th-century MP John Burns described the Thames as \u201cliquid history\u201d, a place that excavates itself twice a day with the tides. \u201cMudlarking in the 18th and 19th centuries was carried out by those desperate to make a living by selling scraps salvaged from the foreshore,\u201d explained Kate Sumnall, curator at the Museum of London, where one of its current exhibitions, Secret Rivers, includes Bronze Age spearheads, medieval weapons and a 19th-century mug found in the gravel of one of London\u2019s most notorious slums, inscribed: \u201cFor A Good Girl.\u201d \u201cIn modern times, mudlarking is transformed into searching for historic survivals,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich give clues about the people who lived here.\u201d It\u2019s also evolved into a community that shares its finds online and, in the case of Evans, at monthly meetings of the Thames and Field club in a riverside pub. \u201cWe\u2019re a mixed bunch of weirdos, professorial types, builders, oddbods\u2026 but we are all obsessed.\u201d Three years ago the Port of London Authority made it illegal to remove anything from the foreshore without a licence, and anything more than 300 years old had to be officially recorded \u2013 which meant, if I did find a treasure, I couldn\u2019t pick it up. \u201cCan you see the tide lines?\u201d Evans said, above the gentle roar of the wind. \u201cThe river arranges everything by weight. This is the pottery beach \u2013 over there is metal.\u201d She pointed west. \u201cLook, even the ground looks ferrous.\u201d We walked slowly, eyes down and within seconds found a shard of blue and white china. \u201cThis was very fashionable in the 17th century, when it was imported from Westerwald in Germany,\u201d she said, and as we continued I saw more \u2013 a cobalt blue flash beneath a stone and another by the water, and soon it felt as though she had taught me a new way to look, another layer of sight. We were on the site of the first English Delftware pot houses, but much of the pottery we found was, Evans said, \u201cVictorian trash.\u201d She long ago \u201cgraduated\u201d to more rare finds, like the tiny pins she identifies by the shapes of their heads and the button-like object she gasped at, half-submerged in water. \u201cIt\u2019s a decorative lead mount with gilding,\u201d she said, quietly excited, \u201cJacobean, I think, or Tudor.\u201d For Evans the value lies in its remaining details \u2013 a flower, a star \u2013 though recently a fellow mudlarker found a piece of Tudor silver that was worth hundreds of thousands. Once it has been recorded, he\u2019ll get 50%. Evans is selective about what she takes home to display in her kunstkammer, and regularly replaces pieces, returning old ones to the river at the spot where she found them. Recently, she found half a tin-glazed French Quimper plate, eventually throwing it back because it was too big for her flat \u2013 only to see it posted on another mudlarker\u2019s Instagram weeks later. Evans has written a series of children\u2019s stories that teach history through found objects from the river, but for her the joy of mudlarking is as much about the hunt as the treasure. \u201cIt\u2019s meditative, isn\u2019t it? I love to be on my own by the water. I love the feeling that it\u2019s bigger than me.\u201d The light was fading, and she looked out towards a pub that\u2019s been there since the mid-1400s, hence the many clay pipes still to be found in the mud beneath its windows. \u201cThere\u2019s a seamy side to the river, of course \u2013 the slave trade, the hangings, the impoverished early mudlarkers. It\u2019s a privilege to see this cumulative history, all these lost lives. By collecting the pieces I become a part of it.\u201d On a typical evening Evans might find bones from tanneries, roof tiles from the fire of London, clay pipes from the late-1500s, and Caribbean shells used as ballast on a 17th-century ship. I stumbled over the jaw of a horse, teeth intact. \u201cAh,\u201d she said, inspecting a piece of heavy brown pottery. \u201cThis is a shard of a Bellarmine jar. They called them witch bottles and would use them for curses. Put a nail clipping in there, a bit of piss, curse the person, then bury it.\u201d She was calling out this information to me across the rocks. I was not wearing the correct shoes, nor could I take notes in the light rain. She slowed down. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, waiting for me to catch up. She wasn\u2019t used to having company. Despite the commuters a street away, we hadn\u2019t seen or heard another person in an hour. \u201cApart from my daughter, I always say no when friends ask to join me on the foreshore,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThough later I love the camaraderie of sharing our found objects, it\u2019s a solitary pursuit. I believe everyone should try this, try to use the history of the river to understand their homes and cities. Just\u2026\u201d she says apologetically, \u201cnot with me.\u201d Evans walked me back to the Chinese restaurant, and I turned just in time to see her disappear again, down the steps back to the shore. Florence Evans curates an exhibition about mudlarking as part of the Totally Thames festival. Foragers on the Foreshore will be at the Bargehouse on South Bank 24-29 September.
