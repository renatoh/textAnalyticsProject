In this election, we need the 'boring' outcome", "bodyText": "I noticed that most of the Sunday papers had an editorial solemnly advising their readers how they believed their votes should be cast next Saturday. My first reaction was: \u201cHow quaint!\u201d Given the very low levels of newspaper readership in Australia these days, I was hard put to imagine who would read them, let alone heed them. But then I remembered my parents, many years ago, earnestly reading (often aloud to each other) and debating similar editorials and felt nostalgia for a time when the electorate had far less media and far fewer opportunities to get political information but were more genuinely politically aware. They also had far fewer political parties and independents to contend with. According to the Australian Electoral Commission there are currently 57 registered political parties. Whilst commentators complain about three-word slogans and the dumbing-down of politics by politicians, many voters are getting their information from GetUp! petitions, Facebook \u201cdiscussions\u201d and push polling where telemarketers phrase a question with the aim of getting a predetermined answer. It\u2019s become a commonplace view that the election has primarily been about economics and that\u2019s boring. It\u2019s even posited as a reasonable excuse for opposition leader Shorten\u2019s outrageously dishonest campaign about the privatisation of Medicare. \u201cAt least it was something different to talk about\u201d seems to be the rationale. I fervently hope that we end up with a boring outcome in this election \u2013 a Coalition government with a workable senate. This isn\u2019t the time for interesting experiments, although it is interesting that Mr Shorten, on Four Corners, has only discovered since he became leader that unity is more important than factionalism. With more and more candidates jostling to communicate with their constituents, it\u2019s not surprising that the messages are getting simpler or that voters are using their own methods to filter the message. But this isn\u2019t the election to play games with the system. No one knows what the outcome of the new senate voting system will be \u2013 the ABC\u2019s psephology guru Antony Green has refused to make predictions, saying they would only be meaningless given the total lack of precedent. But Mr Green notes four recent polls suggesting that between 12% and 14% of the electorate will vote for parties other than the Coalition, the ALP or the Greens. In the senate where all 76 seats are being contested there are 631 candidates, an average of 8.3 candidates per seat. With this degree of uncertainty, it\u2019s no wonder the Coalition have launched a last-week advertising campaign urging voters to \u201cBe Sure. Vote Liberal.\u201d It echoes Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s pleas to voters to not only support the Coalition in the House of Reps but also in the Senate. On this basis, I\u2019ve been assessing my local Liberal National Party How to Vote card in Queensland. For the House of Reps, it\u2019s pretty simple\u2014LNP 1, then Labor and the Greens in the last two places with another three arranged in the middle. For the Senate, it\u2019s more intriguing: LNP at 1; then Family First; Katter\u2019s Australian Party; Shooters, Fishers and Farmers; Christian Democratic Party (Fred Nile); and Australian Christians. Now I must admit these are not my personal preferences. I even had to look the Australian Christians up although I thought I could guess from the name where they stood. Nevertheless this is the way I\u2019ll vote. I know some mathematical types (almost invariably youngish and male) far more interested than me in the more arcane art of preference flows have done the calculations. The objective is to maximise the chances of the six sitting LNP senators being elected. If this means I give my sixth preference to the Australian Christians, so be it. The ALP in Queensland have a similarly interesting How To Vote card. Labor 1 and Greens 2 is expected but then the Australian Sex Party; Jacqui Lambie Network: Glenn Lazarus Team and Katter\u2019s Australian Party in that order? Weird, but obviously designed to maximise the Labor vote. Whatever the outcome on Saturday, I really hope it produces three years of boring, stable, workable government.
