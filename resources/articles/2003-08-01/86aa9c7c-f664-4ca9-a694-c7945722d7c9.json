The Williams driver was handed the penalty for his involvement in a first-lap crash at the German Grand Prix earlier this month, which also involved Rubens Barrichello and Kimi Raikkonen. The sport's governing body's court of appeal upheld the decision of race stewards to punish the German, but deemed the penalty \"inappropriate\" and replaced it with a \u00a333,000 fine [$50,000]. An FIA statement read: \"Having heard the explanations of the parties and examined the various documents and other evidence, the court confirmed the stewards' findings against Ralf Schumacher, but considered that the sanction imposed was inappropriate and substituted a fine of $50,000.\" The court also questioned, after studying accident data recorder information unavailable to stewards at the time, the roles of Ferrari driver Barrichello and McLaren's Raikkonen in the incident. To determine whether the pair may have been responsible, the court have referred the matter back for German Grand Prix stewards to reinvestigate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
