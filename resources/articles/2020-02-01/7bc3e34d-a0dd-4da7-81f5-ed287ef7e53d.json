In a judgment handed down on Thursday, the federal court, sitting as the court of disputed returns, said it would not refer Simon Frost to the high court, despite his admission that the signs, which were written in Chinese and used at the 2019 election, were intended to look like the AEC\u2019s material. The court was required to decide whether it would refer Frost after it handed down a decision in December over a challenge to the election of the Liberals Gladys Liu, in Chisholm and the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong. It found the purple and white signs were misleading or deceptive, but it dismissed the challenge to Liu and Frydenberg\u2019s victories, saying there was \u201cno real chance\u201d the corflutes could have affected the results. On Thursday, federal court justices James Allsop, Andrew Greenwood and Anthony Besanki said in their decision that the nature of the court challenge meant it had not examined enough evidence to satisfy by the \u201crelevant fault element\u201d. \u201cGiven the limited nature of our findings in the December reasons and the way the hearing of the petitions was conducted we are not in a position to draw such conclusion about Mr Frost\u2019s state of mind and knowledge and it would be unfair on him so to do,\u201d the judgment said. The court found that the signs were \u201conly misleading or deceptive when placed adjacent to the AEC material\u201d and that \u201cMr Frost was not cross-examined on any instructions about the placement of the corflutes\u201d. Submissions from Frost\u2019s counsel had \u201ccorrectly pointed out\u201d that Frost had not been represented in court and \u201cthat there were many loose ends in his evidence, to a degree favourable to him\u201d, the court said. \u201cNo findings were made, nor did the proceeding address, any fault element to allow any conclusion that Mr Frost acted in a way that may be said to amount to the committal of an offence,\u201d the judgment said. The challenge was brought by climate campaigner Vanessa Garbett, who lives in Liu\u2019s electorate of Chisholm, in Melbourne\u2019s east. The two signs \u2013 one in traditional Chinese characters, and one in simplified Chinese \u2013 were used in seven electorates in Victoria and said the \u201ccorrect way to vote\u201d was to put 1 next to the Liberal candidate. In their judgment that asked Frost to explain why he should not be referred to the high court, the justices said: \u201cThe deliberateness of the attempt to make the sign look like an AEC sign by someone in Mr Frost\u2019s position bespeaks a view of someone with experience in political campaigning that there was some advantage in doing so.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
