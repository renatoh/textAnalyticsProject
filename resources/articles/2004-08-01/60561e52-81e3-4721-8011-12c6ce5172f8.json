Especially, it seems, from the Daily Mail front page 'What a way to run an airline!' If they could have heard the conversation in the gents over at Derry Street, however, they might not have been so surprised. John Bryant, senior production executive on the Mail, was still spitting tacks as he told colleagues about his delayed flight and lost luggage after his return flight from Athens last weekend. There's nothing like personal involvement to sharpen up those news values. Shame on you Oh to have been a fly on the wall at Heathrow last week when BAA chief executive Mike Clasper took a break from working out where to put all those delayed passengers. Clasper was lined up to pose with an 'inflatable poster' (whatever that is) of an athlete leaping over Terminal 1 to publicise BAA's support for London's Olympic bid. There appears to have been a certain amount of rewriting of history afoot at BAA, which would have us believe that its \u00a38 billion investment in Terminal 5 and upgrades at Gatwick and Stansted was made with the 2012 games in mind. Clasper promises a 'high quality, highly efficient experience for the large influx of air travellers for the Olympics'. The award for 'most shameless bandwaggoning' is in the post via air mail. It may be there some time. Sorry, closed To mark the end of August we launch a final silly season project: a hopeless cause campaign. Obviously the best ones have been taken already (see London's Olympic bid, above) but, courage, mes braves, there must be others. A call to the Keep Sunday Special campaign, wheeled into action last week to mark the 10th anniversary of liberalised Sunday shopping, supplies some useful inspiration regarding tactics. 'Bond Pearce, the law firm whose partner Tony Askham helped to draft the legislation, has four offices. I telephoned all of them to ask whether I could make an appointment to see a solicitor on Sunday. Guess what? They do not work on Sundays.' Brilliant. Second glance Can you guess what it is yet? Yes! It is Rolf Harris, contemplating a mega-million pound pay-off for his sterling contribution to animal welfare deemed by some a reward for failure but certainly not by anybody here on Cheapside. Meanwhile, Michael Green attempts to get into character for a new series following the fortunes of injured networks in intensive care. Confused? Even their mothers could not tell them apart. Class ad You get a better class of advertisement in the John Lewis Partnership's internal newspaper, The Gazette. Alongside the details of a Mercedes and two luxury villas in Florida is one that particularly grabs the eye: 'Trakehner Warmblood horses of the very best breeding in the UK. Mainly young stock bred by Partner'. We can only guess at the salaries that sustain hobbies such as this and Cheapside has to leave you at once in order to apply for a job. If we succeed, watch this (empty ) space."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
