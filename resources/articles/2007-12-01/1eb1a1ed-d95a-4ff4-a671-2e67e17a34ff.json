However, the biggest surprise was that it took Mills 72 minutes to be sent from the pitch, after which he pointed to a swelling below his right eye in a flimsy defence that he had to some extent been sinned against. \"Players need more protection,\" he argued. Who had hit him? \"I'm not bothered about that,\" he said as he disappeared into the night. Mills was involved in a flare-up with the former Charlton man Bryan Hughes that earned a booking for the latter while the Hull strikers Caleb Folan and Frazier Campbell also had their names taken following clashes involving Mills - who was booked himself for his part in the second incident - before Mills received a straight red for uttering an obscenity in the referee's direction after another needless collision with Folan. All of which clearly exasperated Alan Pardew who had said beforehand he would like to make Mills' loan move from Manchester City a permanent one. Now the Charlton manager is not so sure. \"We need to absorb what has happened today,\" said Pardew, who will lose the former England right-back to a three-game ban which will effectively cover the end of his loan spell. \"I can't offer many excuses for him today. Danny is big enough to hold his hands up but I'm disappointed in his actions. He is a bubbly character in the dressing room, quite eccentric but he always plays on the edge.\" Pardew continued, however: \"The referee didn't help us one iota. Hull were deliberately taking their time at set pieces and putting in some very tough tackles. It was always going to be a competitive game after our fixture at Hull in October but the referee could have controlled it better.\" Dean Windass was apparently the agent provocateur of that bad-tempered encounter on Humberside in October that led to two dismissals and fines for both clubs. But with the Hull striker suspended this time, Mills decided he was just the man to tarnish Charlton's 50th anniversary celebrations of their famous 7-6 victory over Huddersfield. It took more than his bizarre behaviour and the absence of Andy Reid to explain what Pardew correctly summed up as \"a disjointed\" performance by his play-off contenders. But Pardew was far less accurate in his assessment of Hull's contribution as \"ugly\". That looked like sour grapes as the Tigers had been much the better balanced team, deserving a far greater interval lead than the single goal fired in from an acute angle by the lively Campbell. Nicky Weaver was a far busier goalkeeper than his counterpart, Boaz Myhill, whose only save had been to spare his captain, the otherwise excellent Ian Ashbee, the embarrassment of an own-goal, before being beaten by Madjid Bougherra's undeserved close-range equaliser. \"It's not often you are disappointed to get only a point from a visit to The Valley,\" said Hull's manager, Phil Brown. \"It's a hard place to come. We restricted Charlton to four shots, which tells its own story. I was pleased with the performance of my team but I can't be a happy man, because we should have won the game.\" Man of the match Ian Ashbee (Hull City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
