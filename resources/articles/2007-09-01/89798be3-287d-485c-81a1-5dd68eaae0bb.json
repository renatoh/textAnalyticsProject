Eric Knight, whose shareholder group owns about 1% of HSBC, claims that the bank's share price is up to 50% undervalued after a disastrous foray into sub-prime lending in the US, a wasteful $40bn acquisition spree, and a failure to exploit opportunities in China. Yesterday Mr Knight was in London drumming up support for a formal strategic review of HSBC, presenting a 240-page dossier to major institutional investors in which he attacks HSBC's share price performance compared to its rivals. The dossier also highlights what he claims is a deeply flawed boardroom bonus scheme which allows directors to scoop huge payouts even if shareholders see little return. Mr Knight's main concerns are: that 75% of HSBC's capital is allocated to developed world markets \"where profits growth is lowest\"; the share price of HSBC is \"third or fourth quartile\" when ranked over one, three, seven and 10 year periods; the bank has followed a \"poorly executed\" acquisition strategy including Household in the US and CCF in France; and it failed to spin-off its US sub-prime business when it had an opportunity to do so and it has won just 0.2% of the Chinese banking market, 1.3% of the Indian market and its management resource is wrongly focused on Europe and North America. HSBC yesterday broke its silence, issuing a point-by-point rebuttal of Mr Knight's allegations, claiming that its major investors stand firmly behind the bank's strategy. A spokesman said: \"In recent months we have met with hundreds of institutional investors and the vast majority support the bank's strategy.\" He added: \"It's not entirely clear he [Mr Knight] has a grip of what's going on in Asia. We are the biggest foreign commercial bank in India and in China we are expanding as fast as the regulators allow us. In Latin America we have gone from nothing to a profit of $3bn in ten years.\" Mr Knight, a Dutchman by birth who divides his time between New York and Monaco, runs a relatively small investment boutique called Knight Vinke Asset Management. But it is backed by the world's largest pension scheme, the $250bn Calpers fund (the California Public Employees Retirement System), and played a role in the abolition of Royal Dutch Shell's dual share structure in 2004 and attempts to block the merger of Suez and Gaz De France. Mr Knight said: \"We have the support of Calpers and there are other funds with more than $100bn under management who are supporting us. We have started to put calls out to other institutional investors and nine of the 30 biggest institutions have expressed interest. \"But let's be clear about this; we are not calling for an immediate break up of the bank or for [HSBC executive chairman] Stephen Green to stand down. It's a question of opening the debate and presenting evidence to major investors. It will take a few months but I'm convinced we'll get there.\" It is understood he would prefer a review of the bank's operations to be carried out by Simon Robertson, a non-executive director of HSBC and former Goldman Sachs investment banker. But beyond the support of Calpers, yesterday there were no institutional investors willing to come forward as supporters of Knight. Instead, a number of HSBC's biggest shareholders are lining up in support of the bank. One of the 20 biggest investors - who preferred to remain off the record - told the Guardian yesterday: \"We have been having this debate for four years and are now quite comfortable with HSBC's strategy. Yesterday Mr Knight said he was \"waiting for HSBC to get back\" on his request for a meeting, but HSBC countered that it had no knowledge of such a request."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
