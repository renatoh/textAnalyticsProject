Leicester enjoyed a more comfortable afternoon at home to the bottom side, Worcester, keeping their opponents at bay in the last 10 minutes to win 28-20. At The Stoop, fly-half Malone contributed 16 points in his team's 26-25 success. He landed three penalties, two conversions and a drop goal after creating his side's opening try for centre Tosh Masson. Malone's 66th-minute conversion finally secured victory, after a sustained spell of forward pressure produced a try for replacement back-row forward Tom Guest. Spurning the chance of a penalty goal, Quins cracked the Wasps defence after winning the resulting line-out. The visitors repelled four drives by the Harlequins pack, but a massive surge forced the resulting scrum over the try-line for Guest to touch down. Malone was fortunate not to be punished for missing two simple late penalty chances when Wasps replacement Dave Walder saw his long-range drop-goal attempt drift narrowly wide deep into injury time. Wasps had earlier scored two tries via centre Fraser Waters and Ireland's World Cup scrum half Eoin Reddan. But Danny Cipriani miscued a 74th-minute penalty that would have given put his team back ahead, having already landed two conversions and a penalty. The other Wasps point came from a superb first-half drop goal from centre Riki Flutey. Leicester stayed in touch with the leaders with a fourth win in their six games in the absence of England quintet Martin Corry, Ben Kay, Lewis Moody, George Chuter and Dan Hipkiss. After the sides traded early penalties, Leicester went ahead midway through the half when Ben Herring went over from close in after hanging on to Benjamin Kayser's throw at the back of the line-out. Burke converted for 10-3. Worcester were level after 28 minutes when Dale Rasmussen powered over from close range and Drahm converted. Burke slotted home another penalty seven minutes later and Leicester went further clear moments after the restart. Ollie Smith snatched the ball just as Ryan Powell was about to pick up and charged through from 50 metres to touch down. Burke's conversion made it 20-10. Drahm and Burke swapped penalties early in the second half and after 58 minutes Kayser powered over from close range for Leicester. Burke ,missed the conversion and Worcester hit back. Thinus Delport sent Drew Hickey over on 69 minutes. Loki Crichton's conversion cut the lead to eight points and Worcester could not get any closer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
