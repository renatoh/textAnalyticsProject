It's about the Big Pharma drug companies exploiting and corrupting people and governments; Ralph Fiennes' Justin is a British diplomat delving into murky British business in Kenya after his idealistic wife (an Oscar-winning Rachel Weisz) Tessa is murdered. We're used to Le Carre's intrigue and betrayals, but this has real passion too. O Lucky Man! Sky Cinema 2, 11pm (Lindsay Anderson, 1973) Malcolm McDowell's Travis, the renegade public-school pupil from Anderson's If, returns in this sequel as an ambitious salesman on a surreal odyssey. As a satirical assault on the state of the nation it's a ramshackle affair, barely held together by the likes of Ralph Richardson's crooked industrialist. Choses Secr\u00e8tes Film4, 1.35am (Jean-Claude Brisseau, 2002) Cahier du Cinema's film of the year is a hard-hitting, thought-provoking, very steamy thriller. Fired from a Paris strip club, Nathalie (Coralie Revel) and barmaid Sandrine (Sabrina Seyvecou) decide to sex their way to success: what follows is part philosophical essay on female empowerment, part porn melodrama - something for everyone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
