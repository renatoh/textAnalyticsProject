A few escaped the trawl. The Thames is the most important, though its non-tidal length above Teddington is now controlled by a government body - the Environment Agency. Elsewhere, the Bridgewater Canal escaped nationalisation by being owned by the Manchester Ship Canal Navigation Company. It still is, and has returned to being the more profitable partner now that scarcely a ship a week uses the MSCN. The River Avon also escaped the British Waterways net, though at the time of nationalisation elsewhere it was passable only to Pershore, about a third of the distance that had first been made navigable by William Sandys as long ago as the late 1630s. Opening the river up as far as Stratford, Sandys proposed to take it all the way to Warwick to exploit the coal trade. What a great shame he never made it, as I will find to my cost a bit later in this journey. In 1717 ownership of the river was split into the Upper and Lower Avon, the dividing line being Evesham. The Upper river was bought in 1863 by the Great Western Railway which by refusing to charge tolls avoided the need to maintain the river and by 1875 it was impassable. The Lower Avon deteriorated at a slower rate, though downhill it went too until bought for \u00a31,500 by C.D. Barwell in 1950, who formed the Lower Avon Navigation Trust to restore his bit of the river. Meanwhile the Stratford on Avon canal was being restored by the National Trust and was fully reopened in 1964. That kick-started restoration work on the Upper Avon, which was also formed into a trust under David Hutchings in 1965. Less than 10 years later it too reopened, allowing me now to cruise its entire 43-mile 17-lock length. Beyond Stratford, Warwick though relatively near is so far as the only way for a boat to reach the broad waters of the Grand Union there is by the 13-mile 35-lock length of the Stratford Canal as far as Kingswood Junction with the Grand Union. Apart from the rivers, my route has not touched broad spec canals for more than three weeks. All the way from the Ashton in Manchester to Kingswood they have been narrow, with locks so snug that there are only inches between their sides and my gunwales, and bridges verging on the Toytown. These canals have a great sense of intimacy in the smallness of their scale and closeness to the country they pass through. They don't interfere too much, and after 200 years, as I have mentioned before, seem as much part of the land as any natural feature. Indeed given enclosures and other more recent intensive practices, they are possibly more natural. But now the route moves back to the broad beam of the Grand Union for a couple of days, as it locks down a 21-strong flight to the Avon valley north just north of Warwick and then climbs the other side to meet up with the southern section of the Oxford Canal at Napton Junction, into which the route turns at the end of next week. \u00b7 Mike Holland is writing weekly online dispatches from his canal journey around England.
