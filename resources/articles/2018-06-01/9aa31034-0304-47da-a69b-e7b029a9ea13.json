Cardholders can now use their Visa cards, with services now operating at \u201cclose to normal levels\u201d. Chip and pin transactions were affected, but ATM withdrawals were not. American Express and Mastercard were running a normal service throughout. The outage is believed to have started at around 2:30pm Disgruntled customers at supermarkets, petrol stations and abroad vented their frustrations on social media when there was little information from the financial services firm. Bank transactions were also hit. Experts have advised consumers to carry backup payment options, while Which? warned consumers to be \u201cextra wary\u201d of calls and emails relating to the network failure. Visa said the outage was caused by a hardware failure and was not a result of \u201cunauthorised access or malicious event\u201d. Five hours after an initial statement, the company said its payment systems were almost back to normal. The firm apologised to its customers after it admitted it fell \u201cwell short\u201d of its reliability targets today. Here is their latest statement: Earlier today, Visa had a system failure that impacted customers across Europe. Our goal is to ensure all Visa cards work reliably 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We fell well short of this goal today and we apologise to all of our partners, and most especially, to Visa cardholders. Visa cardholders can now use their Visa cards as we are currently operating at close to normal levels. The issue was the result of a hardware failure. We have no reason to believe this was associated with any unauthorised access or malicious event. UK Finance, a trade association which represents leading firms in the payments industry, said: Visa is currently experiencing a service disruption which is preventing some Visa transactions in Europe from being processed. It is investigating the cause and acting as quickly as possible to resolve the situation. Visa is working with banks, building societies, merchant acquirers and card providers to return to a normal service and will provide regular updates. Customers should check their bank, building society or card provider website or contact them with any queries. Which? has warned that the widespread network failure could attract scammers and advised people to be \u201cextra wary\u201d of calls or emails related to the outage. Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: Clearly this issue will be a huge inconvenience to customers and it must be resolved urgently. Visa and the banks need to ensure no-one is left out of pocket due to this outage. We strongly advise people to keep any evidence of extra expenses they\u2019ve incurred in order to claim them back.\u201d Guardian Money\u2019s Miles Brignall has just returned from the Morrisons supermarket in Letchworth. It\u2019s cash only signs up. Plenty of shoppers have abandoned their baskets. Others are queuing up outside the ATMs outside the building. Everyone\u2019s pretty good natured considering. He says he was able to pay using a MasterCard and had no problems. Amex was also being taken but no Visa cards. Readers have been getting in touch with their experiences. Although the outage appears to have struck at around 2:30pm, one reader said she was unable to use her Visa debit at lunchtime. Rebecca Rapport said: My Visa debit was declined in M&amp;S in the City at about 13:15 today. The sales assistant thought it was the card machine so I used Apple Pay. Sounds like this has been happening earlier than reported. Rich Dunning, an administrator at the University of Liverpool who is currently working in the US with a colleague, had his card declined. We\u2019re currently in the US for work and all our Visa work cards were declined, so it looks like the outage seems to be affecting cards being used outside Europe, too. Luckily I had some dollars in cash from earlier and a colleague has a MasterCard so we\u2019re not totally stuck! Amid a lack of information at a the supermarket till, reader Fiona Hillhouse had to make various enquiries at Asda and her bank before being told about the problem. My husband and I had nipped to Asda earlier to get some shopping. My husband used his card to pay and checkout assistant declared it was declined. They tried three times, so I ran out to the car to get my card which I\u2019d used just before to pay the hygienist. We have a joint account so I used my card - declined too. The none-to-helpful checkout assistant told us to take it up with the bank. How could both cards not be working? And how were we going to pay for our shopping? My husband used his credit card. Got home. Phoned the bank, waited half an hour to speak to someone. Account was fine it must be Asda\u2019s machines. Phoned Asda. Was advised it was a problem with Visa. Could they not have told us that instead of making us feel mortified as if we didn\u2019t have money in our bank account in front of a queue of customers. I\u2019m just relieved someone hasn\u2019t emptied our bank account! Guy Anker, the deputy editor of consumer website MoneySavingExpert.com, criticised the network failure in an age when we \u201crely so heavily on technology\u201d for basic purchases. After TSB\u2019s IT meltdown, this is yet another big banking or payment systems problem for people to have to deal with. It\u2019s simply not good enough in this day and age when we rely so heavily on technology to conduct what are pretty basic things such as buying a drink or a meal. If you\u2019re going out or making a payment online over the weekend, have a look at what\u2019s in your wallet and ensure if you\u2019ve a MasterCard or Amex you take that out or use it. And until this is fixed cash is king if you\u2019re spending out and about, so ensure you\u2019ve enough to get by on in case your cards don\u2019t work. As this is about processing credit or debit card transactions it shouldn\u2019t affect standing orders, direct debits or bank transfers. Peter Hahn, the professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking and Finance, said consumers should be prepared for the possibility of \u201ccyber risks\u201d at all times by having backup payment options. He told Sky News: In today\u2019s world, with cyber risks, everyone really needs to always be carrying two means to make a payment. That almost means you should have two bank accounts. Cyber risks can happen really anywhere. Visa - we tend to think of it as a bank, but for most of us what it means is that it\u2019s a communications network. We have a bank that we\u2019re going to have a credit card from, stores have their banks, and Visa is really the connection between those banks. And it\u2019s got lots of entry points that can be challenged so hopefully they\u2019ve got the expertise to fix those systems quickly. There have been no further updates from Visa since an initial statement sent more than two hours ago. Here is what we know so far. Labour MP Angela Rayner appears to have been affected during a visit to her local garage: Business owners and shoppers out in Broomhill in west Sheffield seemed intensely relaxed about the Visa machine difficulties. \u201cI usually just pay by cash anyway,\u201d said Mandy Stevens, as she came out of Morrisons with her shopping. The store had problems taking card payments all afternoon, with customers going outside and waiting patiently to take money out of a cash point, before returning. Stevens, who runs the SM Hair hairdressers across the road, said the first thing she knew of the troubles had been when a client asked if her machine was working because he had read the news. Her salon\u2019s machine was working fine on Friday. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just certain types of machines or certain places that are having trouble,\u201d she said. Most businesses on Broomhill\u2019s high street reported having some problems taking card payments on Friday afternoon. Richard Stacey from the Record Collector record shop said it had been a quiet day anyway, so the difficulties had not damaged business. A barista at Costa Coffee said he had heard that nearby cash machines were running out of money, which could cause difficulties if the problems persisted. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what tomorrow brings\u201d, he said. Remo Sineone, who runs Remo\u2019s, a cafe and deli, said he had been having particular trouble taking contactless payments on Friday afternoon. \u201cShort term, I can\u2019t really see it being much of a problem to be honest,\u201d he said. Hello, I\u2019ll be on the liveblog this evening. Do get in touch with your Visa outage stories here: isabel.togoh.casual@guardian.co.uk. One British traveller in Sicily has tweeted Visa for help because they cannot pay for train tickets to Palermo to get their flights. Twitter user Oscar Pratelli also stated that he was stranded. Broadcaster Jay Curtis tweeted that he had two Visa payments declined and was put on hold for 40 minutes, only to be told there was a Europe-wide problem. Staff in John Lewis in St Pancras station said Visa payments had been going down sporadically since about 4pm. \u201cSometimes it works, but a lot of transactions have been failing,\u201d Pedro Rodriguez, a sales assistant, said. \u201cMore than 10 transactions have failed. One lady had to call her bank and was quite upset, but most people have a MasterCard as well or cash so it\u2019s ok.\u201d Boots staff said the problem only appeared to effect PIN-number transactions and people were still able to pay for purchases below \u00a330. Thameslink and East Midlands Trains staff said they were not aware of people having difficulties buying tickets. Lisa Eagleton-Muir, 44, had come to London to audition for the Great British Sewing Bee, but could not buy any food at Kings Cross station for the train back to Newcastle. \u201cI\u2019ve only got two cards and they\u2019re both Visa. I tried to buy my tea in M&amp;S and a cafe but they were both rejected. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. It\u2019s a long journey home with no food.\u201d Luckily she was able to withdraw cash from the a cash machine. Paperchase in the station said it had stopped taking any card payments following repeated cancellations. \u201cI tried all my cards and none of them work, I\u2019m going to be really late for my train,\u201d said Alison Merritt Smith, 31, an arts producer. \u201cThe queues are intense in M&amp;S. But the are dealing with it fantastically.\u201d A range of companies have issued statements saying they are having problems with payments: Sainsbury\u2019s said: This seems to be affecting different customers cards in different ways but we are not experiencing significant issues currently. Train operator GWR said its ticket booths and vending machines were not able to accept Visa cards. A spokesman said that onboard train staff were aware of the issue and it was possible for passengers to buy tickets on the train with cash. We encourage passengers to use cash to buy tickets at ticket offices or the machines before they travel. We are taking steps to make ticket buying as easy as possible for passengers at this time. Wetherspoons confirmed it was suffering from \u201cintermittent Visa card issues\u201d which were affecting all cards processed by chip and pin or its mobile app. The pub group is asking customers to use an alternative card provider or cash. A TfL spokesperson said: Customers using contactless payment cards should be able to carry on using our Tube, bus and rail services as normal. We are monitoring the situation in close collaboration with our payments providers. In Spain, the guardia civil sent a tweet aimed at reassuring those affected by the system failure. Beneath a picture of Johnny Depp as a shocked Captain Jack Sparrow, the force said: \u201cStay calm. If you can\u2019t pay it\u2019s not because you\u2019ve been robbed or hacked. Visa is suffering a service crash in Europe that\u2019s stopping payments going through in its cards. A spokesman for supermarket chain Asda said problems with payments had been happening in stores across the country sporadically since 3pm on Friday. Some payments were going through but some were not, he said. Customers are being told that cash is the best way to pay. \u201cWhen you try and pay something, it sends a message to Visa and then Visa have to send a message back to the chip and pin machine to say this is OK and then the banks are in between at some point. The message that is coming back to the chip and pin, that is where the fault is. \u201cWe are advising customers that cash is the best way to buy your shopping because you can still get cash out with [a] debit card. In Scotland, some supermarkets say Visa is working sporadically and they are opening cash-only tills. Frances, a check out manager at Morrison\u2019s in Anniesland, Glasgow, has been giving out old-style hand-held card machines and paper authentication slips to check out staff, as well as opening more cash-only tills. She says that the outage has been coming in waves, so it is hard to know whether the cards will work or not. Customers are still getting served reasonably quickly though, despite the added delay of calling up to authenticate individual cards. Not quickly enough for Shelley, who was shopping with her two nephews having run out of milk during a babysitting session. She was flustered trying to pay her bill and then add the extra value points to her loyalty card at the customer service desk. The visa outage seems to be by no means uniform, and other stores across the shopping precinct reported no problems at all this afternoon. Banks have been apologising to irate customers for ongoing payment issues. A spokesperson for Royal Bank of Scotland said: We are aware that some customers are experiencing issues using their debit cards. We apologies to customers for the inconvenience and we are working with our suppliers to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Customers are still able to access cash through the ATM network. Some payments were being processed through RBS but it was not clear how many and how many were encountering problems. Lloyds Bank said: We are aware of an industry wide issue effecting Visa payments which is under investigation. ATM and Mastercard transactions are not impacted. We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment on the matter and directed calls to Visa. We are leaving it to Visa to explain what the issue is. There has been no update from Visa since it posted this tweet just before 5pm on Friday Visa card users are experiencing widespread problems making online payments across the UK and in Europe. Visa said some card payments were failing and itwas investigating the cause of the disruption. Many customers have used Twitter to express their frustration and concern that their card payments are being denied. \u201cWe are investigating the cause and working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation,\u201d Visa said in a statement. It is understood that the problem to be limited to Visa card payments only. Several banks have used Twitter to tell customers that they are having some issues processing Visa payments. HSBC said they were \u201cslowly recovering\u201d while First Bank told customers there weren\u2019t \u201cany timescales for resolution at the moment\u201d. We\u2019re going to keep you up to date with all the developments as they happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
