The first guidelines were drawn up two years ago, after banks were threatened with legal action under the Disability Discrimination Act. At that time, people with responsibility for managing the finances of relatives or friends not only had problems dealing with frontline staff who weren't even aware of the different forms of authority, but were also being denied access to online accounts and the higher interest rates they pay. The BBA guidelines were introduced to put pressure on its members to address the issue. They have now been updated to take account of the added complications created by new rules governing payment of state benefits directly into bank accounts, and the need to balance these with the anti-money-laundering regulations. After extensive consultation with government departments, the Public Guardianship Office (PGO) - the Court Service's admin arm - and voluntary groups representing those affected, the new guidelines are focused on making the complex legal requirements as straightforward as possible, while still providing safeguards to protect customers from any financial abuse. The guidelines explain the three main ways in which a person can open and/or manage an account on behalf of someone who is no longer able to do so themselves. In brief, an attorney is nominated by an individual through an enduring power of attorney (EPA), while a receiver is appointed by the Court Service if the EPA is not registered or has not been set up. The receiver is then given specific powers to manage the incapacitated person's financial affairs - which, unlike EPAs, are monitored by the PGO. In some cases, where there's no one else willing or suitable to be a receiver, the PGO takes on the role itself. An appointee has to be authorised by the Department of Work and Pensions to manage someone's benefit payments. The guidelines also set out the different types of documentation banks need to be shown by third parties to establish that they have the authority to act on behalf of a customer. It also explains the verification documents that they must present to prove their own identity, to comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Earlier this year, the BBA ran training courses for bank managers to clarify the whole process, along with explaining the procedures needed to train and update their staff. Most banks now have dedicated units to deal with special interest groups, which provide back-up for frontline staff. The BBA has also produced a leaflet for those handling someone else's financial affairs, to help them navigate their way through this complex system. But banks are not the only problem with which attorneys and others managing people's financial affairs have to contend. There have also been numerous complaints about the length of time it takes both for attorneys to register EPAs with the PGO and for receivers to be appointed, as well as the lack of access to experienced staff. A report published earlier this month by the National Audit Office (NAO) found that the PGO has made some progress compared with the poor performance by the Public Trust Office, which it replaced in 2001. This was particularly true in relation to the number of annual accounts collected from receivers and visits to clients. However, it clearly still has a long way to go. The NAO believes the PGO still needs to target its resources and organise its teams more effectively. In particular, it says it needs to focus its scrutiny of the cases presenting the greatest risks to enable it to catch out people who abuse their position, while ensuring that those who carry out their duties correctly are not bothered by unnecessary bureaucracy. It should also do more to raise its profile and make it easier for people such as relatives, friends, social workers and other professionals to report any concerns about potential mismanagement or financial abuse. An added problem that needs to be addressed is the PGO's inability to access case information quickly when receivers and others call with queries, and delays in dealing with some transactions - which have been compounded by the continuing lack of an electronic system. Earlier this year, the PGO came under even harsher criticism from the parliamentary ombudsman. Though the official report has not yet been published, the PGO was attacked for its role as a receiver when it made serious mistakes in managing vulnerable clients' money. As a result of these mistakes, the clients lost their money. Also, staff were said to be both \"lackadaisical\" and \"staggering in their arrogance\" when handling complaints. The PGO has accepted the criticisms and promised they won't happen again.
