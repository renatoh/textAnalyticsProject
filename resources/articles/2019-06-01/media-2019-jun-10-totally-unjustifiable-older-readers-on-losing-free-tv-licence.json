Both my children work, so I am on my own all day. I have very poor balance thus cannot walk, and I no longer drive, so the TV is company for me. My hearing is poor so I cannot rely upon the radio. The combination of pictures and sound keep me in touch with what is going on in the world. When I began drawing my pension 33 years ago, I thought I had plenty. Over time my pension has not kept pace with inflation, so I have to be particularly frugal. I would probably have to say no to purchasing a TV licence. Evelyn, 98, Woking \u2018The real culprit here is the Tory government\u2019 Having reached the age of 75 last year it now looks like the benefit I derive from the free licence will be short-lived. Given the choices available to the BBC I think they have gone for a pragmatic least worst option. The real culprit here is the Tory government after its decision to load the BBC with the cost of the benefit created by Gordon Brown as one element in a government budget package intended to help those less able to provide for themselves. The Guardian is right to highlight the fact that while the government-initiated removal of the free TV licence is now going ahead, Boris Johnson is promising an increase in the higher-rate tax threshold to \u00a380,000. You couldn\u2019t make it up. Robert, 76, Buckinghamshire \u2018For my mother to pay for a licence will be shameful\u2019 My mother is 85 and can\u2019t leave the house unless I take her. She pays for physiotherapy and a podiatrist at full rate, has no state handouts but just about manages on her pension. She is not at all rich and only has a little in the bank as she doesn\u2019t buy clothes, expensive holidays, run a car or even go to the cinema. The TV is her only companion and way of keeping in touch with the outside world. For her to pay for a TV licence when at least 60% of what is on offer is of no relevance to her will be shameful. Wendy Wright, Northamptonshire \u2018I feel sorry for those pensioners whose income only just exceeds the pension credit limit\u2019 My wife is old enough for us not to pay the licence fee but in June 2020 we will have to start paying. I believe this is the right decision for us as we can well afford to pay the fee as we both have index-linked pensions. It makes sense that only pensioners on pension credit should receive the benefit but I feel sorry for those pensioners whose income only just exceeds the pension credit limit and those who are entitled to pension credit but do not claim it. Every effort should be made to encourage those who are entitled to claim pension credit. Tom Misselbrook, 70, Herefordshire \u2018George Osborne\u2019s decision to make the BBC responsible remains totally unjustifiable\u2019 Of 37 countries surveyed in a 2017 OECD review it was reported that Britain was at the very bottom of the state pension league table. Pensioners, many of whom live in isolation, rely on television as their only contact with the outside world. Free TV licences for the over-75s must be retained as one part of a caring and compassionate social system. George Osborne\u2019s decision to make the BBC responsible for what should clearly be a responsibility of government was, and remains, totally unjustifiable. The government must be made to accept that it cannot subcontract its social policies. Haydn Richard Watkins, 82, Hampshire \u2018At best this should be phased in over five years\u2019 I am single, living on a fixed personal pension. This charge if introduced suddenly will only just be covered by the increase in my statutory state pension. Whilst accepting that the money has to come from somewhere, I do feel that the government has welshed on the original deal and at best should phase it in over a five-year period. James Underwood, 81, Wiltshire \u2018Those of us who have saved for retirement are again being made to lose out\u2019 I\u2019m disgusted, to say the least, as the BBC programming is so much repeats that I rarely watch the BBC channels but I will still have to pay for licence. I like watching sport but the BBC is getting less coverage of sporting occasions, especially rugby. I am an 81-year-old widow, living alone. I live in a development of flats with neighbours of a similar age, and many residents are unable to go out, so TV is a lifeline. Those of us who have saved for our retirement are again being made to lose out. Val, Kent"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
