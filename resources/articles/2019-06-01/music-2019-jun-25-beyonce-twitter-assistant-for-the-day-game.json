Lately it has also been a way to transmit the neuroses of Donald Trump into all of our phones on a near constant basis. But this week a Twitter user devised a use of the social media platform that\u2019s actually fun \u2013 a choose-your-own-adventure game involving Beyonc\u00e9. In the game, \u201cBeing Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s assistant for the day\u201d, the object is simple: don\u2019t get fired \u2013 and it\u2019s a lot harder than it sounds. Celebrities who might know a thing or two about having personal assistants have had trouble themselves, including Questlove, who tweeted that he \u201cfailed the first time\u201d. Chrissy Teigen said that she only made it about three rounds, while her own assistant got fired immediately. While the choices on any given prompt might seem obvious to members of the Beyhive, the difficulty comes in trying to anticipate the whims of a Beyonc\u00e9 character who, at least in this game, seems like something of a tyrant. Asked which of her children you should suggest she FaceTime at one turn in the game, if you choose incorrectly you are let go on the spot. It\u2019s not entirely clear why getting yelled at and terminated by Beyonc\u00e9 is such an avid fantasy for so many, but contemporary fandom is strange, and who are we to judge? The person behind the game is Landon Rivera, a student in Los Angeles. He made the game for obsessive Beyonc\u00e9 fans, he told Vice, \u201cbut then it got really popular\u201d. It has been retweeted almost 100,000 times in the few days since he posted it. \u201cI\u2019d probably end up fired if I was her assistant,\u201d Rivera he said. \u201cI\u2019d definitely try to ask her all kind of questions, like how long did it take to get Lemonade ready, did she have [the] Everything Is Love album planned, why didn\u2019t she release the Formation world tour DVD?\u201d Of course, there is the slim chance that Beyonc\u00e9 herself is behind this and it\u2019s all real, as actor Shay Mitchell tweeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
