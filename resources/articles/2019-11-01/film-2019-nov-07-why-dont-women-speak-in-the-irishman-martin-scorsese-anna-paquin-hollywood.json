Paquin\u2019s was the only big female name alongside the likes of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and a myriad of other recognisable male stars \u2013 an anomaly that held the promise of a particularly meaty female role (if Scorsese\u2019s gangster flicks serve as evidence). But even though The Irishman never suggests it would prominently feature its female characters, few could have anticipated quite how absent its most important female figure is. Played by Paquin as an adult woman and Lucy Gallina as a child, Peggy Sheeran is the daughter of De Niro\u2019s hitman, Frank Sheeran. A practically mute, moral spectre judging her father\u2019s criminal lifestyle from the sidelines, she appears only a handful of times \u2013 less than 10 minutes in total. The Irishman\u2019s narrative revolves around Frank\u2019s imperfect recollections of when he first became involved with the Italian mafia in his 40s through to his present day in a nursing home. Within these boundaries, Peggy is disconcertingly diminished: Paquin speaks six words in a movie that clocks in at three-and-a-half hours. There may be a potency to such intentional restraint within the film\u2019s elegiac trappings, yet circumscribing Peggy as Frank\u2019s moral conscience remains doggedly frustrating. Is she more of a symbol than an actual person? While not exactly gender progressive, Scorsese\u2019s testosterone-fuelled gangster movies have carved out provocative roles for women. Take, for example, Lorraine Bracco\u2019s complicit mob wife in Goodfellas. Along with her protagonist husband, Henry, Bracco\u2019s Karen Hill is given the narrative space to air her grievances and articulate her desires in stretches of voiceover narration \u2013 helping to outline the private and public consequences of Henry\u2019s criminal enterprise. Ginger in Casino, meanwhile, may fit too neatly into the femme fatale archetype, but Sharon Stone\u2019s physically committed performance \u2013 from poised hustler to woman on the edge, brought down by addiction and avarice \u2013 is one of the film\u2019s memorable elements. But Paquin\u2019s Peggy is markedly different from the female roles of Scorsese gangster films past; she is more a tool for expressing the protagonist\u2019s moral blindness, and a vehicle that primes audiences to feel certain ways about other characters, rather than a fully drawn person. As a child, Peggy learns to avoid her father after witnessing a brutal episode that demonstrates his capacity for violence. She openly disdains his shady friend and employer, Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), whom she understands on some instinctive level is a villain and her father\u2019s corruptor; she rebuffs his attempts to win her favour with Christmas cash and ice skates. Instead, Peggy prefers the company of impassioned and personable labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), and his warm, if flawed, paternal instincts. As an adult, Peggy\u2019s taciturn presence is an implicit condemnation of the film\u2019s degraded masculine worldview. The nail in the coffin of Peggy and Frank\u2019s relationship is Paquin\u2019s only spoken line in the film, a six-word question that has Peggy confronting her father after his act of betrayal. Paquin\u2019s comically low line-count is reminiscent of criticism of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Why was Margot Robbie, an Academy Award-nominated actress, given so much less dialogue than her male counterparts? The question was not unwarranted. After all, Robbie\u2019s Sharon Tate is the beating heart of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s unexpectedly tender tale of historical revisionism. The suggestion that Tarantino short-shrifted Robbie spawned a debate that lasted through the summer. Is Tarantino\u2019s Tate an objectified male fantasy? Or is she a triumphantly humanised depiction of a woman whose legacy has been defined by the tragic circumstances of her death? Are the women in Tarantino\u2019s dude-heavy films empowered or problematically rendered? In any case, women in The Irishman are moral reminders and checks on an inward looking all-male reality. So much of The Irishman\u2019s final act has us yearning for Peggy\u2019s final thoughts, for Paquin to take the stage once and for all in some sort of cathartic fashion. But we get no such closure, condemned like Frank to a dreary purgatory of what could have been. Perhaps Scorsese too readily buys into the symbolic potency of women as moral beacons. Peggy\u2019s role is trimmed to a sliver of silent glances by the blinkered, perhaps repressed memories of her aged father \u2013 an easy cop-out for reducing her significance to mere phantom guilt trip with feminine charms. If Scorsese\u2019s filmography has taught us anything, it\u2019s that women are too often caught in the crosshairs of the world of men, whether as victims or cunning culprits, as jezebels or slaves to love. But in opting out of her father\u2019s world, Peggy contextualises the heartlessness and cruelty of the like-minded men (and women) who have so long fascinated the film-maker. Instead, Peggy gestures at an alternative, which strikes me as more than the disgruntled rejection of \u201cdaddy\u2019s little girl\u201d, rather hinting at an entire generational disenchantment. If only she were given the flesh and bones to fully bring to life this subtle revolutionary element."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
