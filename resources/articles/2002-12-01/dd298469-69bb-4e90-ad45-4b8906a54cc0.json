Amiss, the Warwickshire chief executive who succeeds Brian Bolus as chairman of the International Teams Management Group next month, wants an end to restrictions on overseas players - now four per season, though only two on the books at any time. \"County cricket is no longer the same breeding ground for future England players as it was before we went down to one overseas cricketer,\" he said. \"Also, the centrally contracted players play very little for their counties these days. As a result young players rarely get to face Andrew Caddick or bowl to Michael Vaughan. \"The counties could use up their quota of four overseas stars long before the season ends and it will not help our young players. If we throw it completely open next year, each county could bring in top-notchers - Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee, for instance - even for only a few weeks at a time.\" Amiss will put the proposal to representatives of the 17 other counties at today's meeting of the First-Class Forum at Lord's. Hampshire hope to sign the New South Wales left-hander Simon Katich as their second overseas player. Shane Warne will be the club's new captain next season. Katich heads a short-list of three. The others are Victoria's Brad Hodge and New South Wales' Michael Clarke."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
