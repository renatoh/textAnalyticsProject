His most prominent role, between 1999 and 2009, was founding the Guardian Media Group\u2019s radio division, with stations branded Real Radio and Smooth Radio. He became a board member and spent more than \u00a3100m acquiring Century Radio, Saga Radio, Scot FM and Jazz FM. His winning streak allowed him to negotiate an enviable bonus for each successful bid by GMG and he retired at 50, a wealthy man. Myers had been recruited to GMG by its chief executive Sir Robert Phillis. These were gold rush days when newly available commercial radio franchises were being licensed. It was \u201cthe fastest way to millionaires\u2019 row\u201d, Myers observed. He shrewdly understood the need to tailor applications to meet the regulator\u2019s concerns with enough news or sport and local coverage. GMG wanted Myers to repeat what he had already achieved at Border Television, where he built a radio business that dwarfed the ITV station. He had also featured in a BBC observational documentary, Trouble at the Top (1999), about the launch of a new north-west commercial station with the former politician Derek Hatton as a presenter. He swiftly won GMG big regional licences, in Wales, Yorkshire and Manchester. He set its strategy of targeting only large regional radio licences and disposed of its 30 small stations. His brother, Eddie, was his driver as he worked 80-hour weeks. For a while the division flourished. Myers was a giant of a man Clubbable and able to charm, he could also cajole and swiftly close deals on a handshake. But his brash style sat uneasily within GMG. He crossed swords with Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian\u2019s editor, when Myers tried to quash a story about the company\u2019s purchase of two radio stations. \u201cI had to walk a tight line in the early days, the company didn\u2019t know me.\u201d He was carpeted for offering to settle a dispute during an asset sale with an arm wrestle. But he said later that GMG had been \u201cthe best company I ever worked for\u201d. As part of his exit deal in 2009, Myers worked as a stand-in presenter for Smooth Radio. But radio never made much money for GMG. By the time of his departure, the company, struggling in the wake of the financial crash of 2008, was centred on securing the future of the Guardian newspaper. The radio division was sold to Global Radio in 2012 for \u00a370m, half the valuation of six years before. Myers was born in Carlisle, Cumbria, to a Catholic family, one of the nine children of Helen (nee Bromley) and James Myers, who lived in a three-bedroomed council house. His father was a bookmaker and lorry driver. John grew up listening to \u201cLuxie\u201d \u2013 Radio Luxembourg. He was expelled from primary school for ringing the school bell and left Newman Catholic school in Carlisle without any qualifications. After dead end jobs he started doing dance nights at Tiffany\u2019s club in the city. He secured technical support shifts at BBC Radio Carlisle in the early 1980s and through his irrepressible drive and warm voice made it on to air, then landed a weekend breakfast show with the Lancashire commercial station Red Rose. The freelance pay was initially so low that he lived in a caravan to save money. He gained a prized breakfast show on Radio Tees, and then started a regional TV career as a cheeky late night announcer on Border Television in 1985, signing off with \u201ckick the cat out, gag the budgie, come back tomorrow morning for a new day on Border\u201d. He even appeared in pantomime. His philosophy of life was to live, learn, never be boring. The TV dalliance ended after three years. He went into radio management with Red Rose (while hosting a morning show). In 1993 he launched Carlisle\u2019s new commercial station, CFM, then won large radio franchises in the north as Border Radio\u2019s group managing director. After he left GMG, he reflected that too many licences had been awarded through breathtakingly bad decisions by regulators. He said it would have been better to launch several national commercial stations. Between 2005 and 2007 he was part of three attempts to merge GMG Radio with the rival group Chrysalis, but the boards were unable to agree a price. Then recession struck, and by 2009 around 80% of commercial radio stations were unprofitable. Bauer and Global Radio emerged. In 2009, Myers was asked to undertake a review for the Department of Culture, Media &amp; Sport on commercial radio, with some of his recommendations taken up in the Digital Economy Act of 2010. He also advised the BBC on various aspects of streamlining its radio services. He said he was shocked to find BBC working conditions poorer than those at commercial radio. Myers was awarded a fellowship by the University of Cumbria for outstanding contribution to radio in 2012, and was chief executive of the Radio Academy in 2012-13. He donated the proceeds from his 2012 autobiography, Team: It\u2019s Only Radio!, to radio charities. Golf was a passion \u2013 Myers was at the 18th hole of the Gleneagles PGA course when he died. He had recently recovered from throat cancer. He is survived by his wife, Linda (nee Hogg), whom he married in 1985, their son, Scott, and daughter, Kerry, and two grandchildren, Mia and Marcus. \u2022 John Frederick Myers, broadcast executive, born 11 April 1959; died 1 June 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
