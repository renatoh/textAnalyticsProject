There is something fabulously nonchalant about wearing a red lip on a barely there face that actually isn\u2019t totally bare. And it takes just three steps. Take a smidgen of Vaseline to a dab of an au naturel eye shadow to give you a hint of gloss on the eyelid. Mix a highlighter to a dot of foundation and apply like a serum. Finish off with a traffic-stopping red lip. Done. Essentials 1. Nars Studio 54 Audacious Lipstick in Carmen \u00a326, spacenk.com 2.

Ingredients such as lactic acid (brightening), salicylic acid (declogging) and glycolic acid (refining) are so effective at giving your skin a new lease of life \u2013 which is why I am fanatical about it. Everyone should exfoliate \u2013 but not with the grainy stuff \u2013 as it stops your skin looking so grey, controls sebum production and potential breakouts and smooths the texture of your skin, meaning a half-decent makeup-free face. That said, I still meet people who are terrified of it. And I completely understand \u2013 the word acid does not stir up positive connotations. So, as much as I give my spiel about these wonder ingredients, there will be some who won\u2019t budge. Most have sensitive skin and acids + sensitive skin often equals irritation. Well, these cotton pads are excellent exfoliators, sans grains and sans acids. They have been dipped in an acid alternative formulated using probiotics, natural extracts from yarrow and Japanese cedar buds. What this means in layman\u2019s terms is that they remove dead skin, brighten, reduce the appearance of pores and improve texture. Easy to use, they don\u2019t tingle so you can be assured your sensitive skin won\u2019t feel red raw. There goes your excuse not to exfoliate.
