He had Wigan on 51% possession, Watford 49%, which told only 10% of an even match. For the other 90% the ball was going up or coming down, lost in no-man's-air. Watford set out their stall in a space station and it yielded their first away point on a third trip already to the North-West. Chris Hutchings, Wigan's assistant manager, did not complain. \"The style is good for them and we got wrapped up in it. I'm not saying they just boshed the ball up but we needed more strength and belief to get the ball down and play.\" His central midfield was effectively taken out of the game. Wigan had been ready for it, too. \"We have to match them physically, win the personal battles first, then look to use our quality,\" said Paul Jewell. But the writing was always in the programme. Jewell began his notes: \"Welcome to Adrian Boothroyd and his Reading team.\" The table of first-team appearances was chaotic - John Filan three league starts, four goals (as many as Wigan had) and he keeps goal; Gary Teale five League Cup goals from no appearances; and so gibberingly on. Elsewhere Wigan spelt Hameur Bouazza's forename three separate ways. The young Frenchman avenged the slight with the equaliser from a free-kick that other opponents will do well to note. \"We work hard on restarts,\" said Boothroyd. The Watford manager looks so little and young he might need a booster seat if he stayed in the dug-out. \"We put no questions in their heads in the first half,\" he said, \"but in the second we showed what we're about\" - which is fast, high and wide with early crosses. Marlon King's spin and shot went by way of Chris Kirkland's fingertips on to a post and back into the prostrate keeper's arms. Ashley Young might have scored from King's cross but Watford are better served by Euston. They might be better served still if they were not so set on the route Boothroyd has decreed. No one on the field looked more skilful on the ball than Young and Bouazza. \"I'm a bit of an anorak and look at the statistics,\" said Boothroyd. If the ball is in the six-yard box often enough, a team will score. If only he had not consulted the Astronomer Royal as well. The law of averages does not work in front of goal. Consider Emile Heskey. Jewell is the latest man to pay big money, \u00a35.5m, for the big man, believing he can release the flood of goals that ought be inside him. Heskey averages less than a goal every four games over 12 years. From the positions he gets into for sitters a tailor's dummy would score more, if the law applied. Here he rose majestically among the Watford giants to put a potential winner wide with 20 minutes to go. Henri Camara was a greater culprit on the day, a day when goals might have changed tactics and relative confidence. In 15 late first-half minutes he missed twice with only Ben Foster to beat, slewing wide and lobbing short despite his slick opener. That briefly looked controversial but Rob Styles was right to overrule the offside flag of a linesman; Camara received the ball off Malky Mackay's head. Jewell personally welcomed Boothroyd to the band of non-celebrity managers in 2005 but Wigan, with so many changes this summer, hardly seemed Premiership seniors. \"The honeymoon is over,\" said Boothroyd. Judging by the altitude of the ball, the marriage was made in heaven. Man of the match Marlon King (Watford)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
