Despite this, Mauresmo probably gained even more from Saturday's marvellous final than Henin. People forget that the Wimbledon champion had an appendix operation in March, had not faced a top-10 player since then and has not beaten one since February. So to reach 5-3 in the final set against the Tour's outstanding player was her most encouraging performance since both beating and losing to Henin at the Sony Ericsson year-end championships in Madrid fully seven months ago. Apart from failing to get in enough first serves and missing a few volleys - understandable blemishes in the kite-flying conditions - Mauresmo played with rhythm and flair and characteristic daring. Henin, also charactistically, played extremely well at the crucial moments, but Mauresmo should be much fitter mentally than she was when she begins her title defence tomorrow. She has proved that she is a front-line contender again. Before the final it was suggested to Mauresmo that \"the British bookmakers didn't think she has much chance of winning Wimbledon again\". \"It's good. It's good,\" she replied. \"It's good because last year I think I was . . . I don't know, 12 or 14-1. So I am happy, very happy.\" Told that she had shortened to 11-1, Mauresmo cheerfully quipped: \"So, it's better, you see,\" quickly adding that \"this doesn't count\", despite enjoying her own joke. Afterwards Mauresmo's odds shortened even more. Henin overtook Serena Williams as bookies' favourite with her performance. \"Still on grass I have to find myself a little bit more against the powerful players,\" the top seed admitted. \"My serve has been good in the last few days, and hope it will be a weapon for me in the next two weeks.\""}, "isHosted": false}}}
