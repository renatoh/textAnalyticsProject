Cracked pots and wildflowers for a wedding", "bodyText": "I grow alpine plants and other small treasures in terracotta pans, about 35cm x 22cm x 10cm, but some of them broke in the freezing weather. Where can I buy replacements? I have failed to find any so far. What has happened to all the rectangular alpine pots? I can find no trace of them, either. Perhaps they are out of vogue, or too hard to make. But I have found some circular ones, and they will have to do. Look at the \"alpine pans\" at littlethorpepotteries.co.uk and the \"pan pots\" at terrapot.co.uk. I am getting married on 26 June, and would like to grow the wedding flowers myself. It is going to be a very informal day and I want to use wild flowers. I would also like to send seeds or bulbs to my guests, so they can grow some for the big day, too. Any easy-to-grow suggestions? These questions always make my heart sink slightly. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful idea, it's just that it is so very hard to grow flowers to hit a date, and you are starting late. Your guests will find it even trickier, and I would suggest this part of the idea may prove a costly waste of time. Do try to grow some, but have a back-up plan, just in case; check out your local flower market a few weeks ahead and ask sellers what they are likely to have in your chosen wild flower style. And also designate a friend to pick or collect and arrange the flowers for you, because it is a big job and has to be done the day before. Try the following annuals: Ammi majus, for its refined cow parsley looks, cornflowers and love-in-a-mist. Also try summer bulbs: Gladiolus communis subsp. byzantinus is an elegant gladioli in magenta pink, quite different from the florists' versions, and G. colvillei 'The Bride' is similar but in white. Nectaroscordum, a delicately coloured ornamental allium, would also fit with your wild scheme. \u2022 Got a gardening question for Lia?
