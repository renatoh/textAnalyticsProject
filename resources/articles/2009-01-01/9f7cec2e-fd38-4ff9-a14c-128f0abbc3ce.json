Celtic Manor in south Wales will host next year's event when Europe look to wrest back the trophy from the United States. They enjoyed a comprehensive victory at Valhalla in September after which the Europe captain, Nick Faldo, came in for crushing criticism. Lyle, the 1985 Open and 1988 US Masters champion, could face a challenge for the captaincy from Ian Woosnam, who led the team to victory in 2006, but Montgomerie has backed his fellow Scot. Montgomerie told the BBC: \"I'd choose Sandy Lyle if I had the casting vote. It would be a shame if, of all that big [Ryder Cup] side we had of [Bernhard] Langer and Seve [Ballesteros] and Faldo and Woosnam, Sandy Lyle missed out.\" Lyle controversially quit last year's Open at Royal Birkdale after 10 holes, later blaming a hand injury for his early withdrawal, but Montgomerie believes this should not adversely affect the 50-year-old's selection chances. \"I think you are talking to someone who sometimes regrets what I've done throughout my career,\" he said. \"In every sporting arena there are people who regret what they have done and I'm sure he does walking off at the Open, but that shouldn't affect him over his entire career. \"One so-called mistake shouldn't affect him as a Ryder Cup captain and the respect he has from the rest of the players. \"What is vital when it comes to a captaincy is that the team respect him and I'm sure we all do.\" The 45-year-old Montgomerie also revealed his ambition to captain Europe in the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. \"I would expect to [become captain one day] but one never knows when one has to be selected as part of committees and stuff,\" the Scot continued. \"I hope to but you never know. There is the wrong time at the wrong place and the right time at the right place. I just hope I am in the right place come 2014 when it comes home here to Scotland.\" Montgomerie said he might consider retiring as a player at the end of this year. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal has openly said he is ready to follow in the footsteps of his close friend Ballesteros and lead Europe in 2010. \"I would love to be considered, I'm not going to deny that,\" said Olaz\u00e1bal, after Europe lost 10-6 in the Royal Trophy match at Amata Spring near Bangkok. The Spaniard, who was Faldo's deputy in Valhalla last September, has previously been noncommittal on the leadership role."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
