After a career spent in print and production, Wang, as host of the ABC\u2019s It\u2019s Not a Race podcast, has found herself behind one of the national broadcaster\u2019s highest-profile offerings. A community has built up around her work, which discusses race in modern Australia with thoughtfulness and a voice that assuredly does not know all the answers. It is honest about the contradictions of its own purpose \u2013 one episode on the question \u201cIs Australia racist?\u201d concludes that it actually just doesn\u2019t matter. Born and raised in Vancouver, Wang has a degree in semiotics and a background in daily print news, where race and podcasting were mostly absent. She studied journalism in New York after 9/11, the city still in crisis mode, then was posted by Associated Press to New England where she reported on murders, the Vermont same-sex marriage debate and state politics. She covered the 2008 New Hampshire presidential primary, where she watched Hillary Clinton win, and once made eye contact with Barack Obama in a local restaurant. It wasn\u2019t until she moved to Australia in 2009 that she entered radio. She was a casual writer for the ABC\u2019s Radio Australia when someone said they needed a producer. \u201cI got about two days of training in how to produce live radio, then I was off,\u201d she says \u2013 making a three-hour, nightly rolling news show. She became a producer on Waleed Aly\u2019s drive program in Melbourne and, by 2012, was executive producer of the show, which was by 2015 hosted by her close friend Patricia Karvelas. The next year Wang saw an opportunity come up and pitched a podcast about race to the ABC. \u201cWhy race? I mean, why not race? In Australia, I think so much hunger for this kind of material is out there. People are incredibly hungry to talk. We [non-white Australians] have an expectation of not being reflected but, if you\u2019re white and you\u2019re privileged, you never have to look for yourself.\u201d She is keen to point to the work others have done on race. \u201cI never want to act like I created this genre because there are a lot of people who have been labouring in this area for many, many years.\u201d Despite this fact, Wang has found herself becoming a face of race discussion; a lightning rod for those eager to talk and those eager to see the conversation stop. Her Twitter account bears the phrase \u201cnot your personal race whisperer\u201d because, in the early days of the podcast, she found herself fielding incredibly specific questions from people on all matters tangentially related to race and identity. \u201cSomeone wrote me a very long message asking what they should think about the fact that two African students in his university lecture wore wigs,\u201d she says. \u201cHe said they were very obviously wigs and asked what he should think about them. I just looked at it and I thought, \u2018You know what? They don\u2019t have any thoughts about what you think about their wigs. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\u201d Talking openly about race in Australia has touched a nerve. \u201cWe get our share of complaints,\u201d she says. \u201cEmails saying Beverley Wang should be sacked and should apologise to the ABC for making a terrible program like this.\u201d She says she was even targeted by a far-right nationalist organisation with a \u201cmenacing\u201d email that said, \u201cWe need to meet and sort this out.\u201d \u201cIt just goes to show you that talking about race and identity hits at the core of so many people. We get social media comments like, \u2018Why are you so obsessed with race? There\u2019s only one race: human.\u2019 That\u2019s a classic one.\u201d While she appreciates the sentiment, Wang \u2013 and many others \u2013 says this kind of criticism misses the point. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t invent the concepts of racial categories or racism but they are actually real and we deal with them and they have profound impacts. It\u2019s lovely that you think there is only one race \u2026 but, in reality, racism is real so this is why we\u2019re here.\u201d Almost as cosmic proof, on the eve of her fourth episode, Wang entered the ABC Melbourne studio to endure a maddening interview from the then breakfast show host, Red Symons, that was so rude it was cut from broadcast and later taken down online. The interview was widely reported and prompted an official apology. Symons, an ABC colleague hosting Wang for a promo spot for her show\u2019s first season, began by telling her he didn\u2019t like her podcast because \u201che had the idea first\u201d. \u201cYou had the idea first?\u201d she said. \u201cYeah, but my podcast was called \u2018What\u2019s the deal with Asians?\u2019\u201d In the course of the interview, Symons also forgot her name (calling her Jenny), asked \u201cAre you yellow?\u201d and pursued a baffling segment where he said her birth name was \u201cChrysanthemum flower\u201d. In that 10-minute exchange was an experience that many migrants would have known well: the stomach-churning realisation that yes, this is happening to you again; the management of anger; the commitment to open, cheerful engagement in the hope that maybe a mind could be changed. While Wang will not discuss what happened between her and Symons, when pressed she talks about her experience of racism generally (something \u201cpretty standard for someone who isn\u2019t Anglo\u201d) and the conundrum of choice that always faces the victim. \u201cSometimes you get praised for, \u2018You responded to that racism in such a classy way, good on you.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s great but equally it is totally valid to tell someone off if they\u2019re being racist to you. It\u2019s totally OK if your response is, \u2018Go to hell.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s an issue Wang says she has become more comfortable with as she has become older. Conversations about race are difficult but part of why she entered the arena is that she believes, in podcasting, she has found \u201cthe format to fit the conversation\u201d. \u201cI think there\u2019s something about the intimacy of a podcast \u2013 you\u2019re on your own, you have your earbuds in, it\u2019s your time to listen to what you want to listen to. I have a feeling that we wouldn\u2019t make a daily or weekly radio show only about race.\u201d In making It\u2019s Not a Race, Wang, who is aware of being a relatively new migrant to Australia, says she has learned a lot herself about Indigenous Australia and the unique, complex experience of whiteness in this country. \u201cNo culture, race or ethnicity is a monolith. I get a lot of responses from people from Mediterranean and eastern European backgrounds who say they relate to a lot of stories that we tell. They feel like they have grown outside, they have that really strong immigrant connection.\u201d She also considers Indigenous issues the \u201cunique, founding racialised experience in Australia\u201d. \u201cSomething I really learned is that the Aboriginal Australian story is really central. We are not telling the full story unless we speak to Aboriginal people as well. I think the more you talk to people and learn you really see how it is the intractable core issue at the heart of Australia. That\u2019s been huge for me to learn about.\u201d This year Wang will be even busier. She is now setting up Stop Everything, a new pop culture show on Radio National that she will produce and present alongside Benjamin Law and Dr Lauren Rosewarne. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously going to have fun with it but we are going to be girding that with analysis and big questions,\u201d she says. \u201cPop culture isn\u2019t disposable. We are swimming in pop culture. Race is a part of pop culture. Everything. We can\u2019t get away from it.\u201d She is thinking of ways to keep It\u2019s Not a Race sustained \u2013 with events or Facebook Live broadcasts, perhaps \u2013 and doesn\u2019t want to give up the community the podcast has established. The show\u2019s second season finale, released last month, was a live recording in Melbourne with a panel of all-star guests. \u201cIt was incredible to look out on that stage and be like, \u2018Wow, we built this.\u2019 This was a Google Doc in 2016 and at the end of 2017 I\u2019m standing on a stage with three incredible panellists looking at a crowd of enthused, engaged people who bothered to come out. It makes me want to cry a little bit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
