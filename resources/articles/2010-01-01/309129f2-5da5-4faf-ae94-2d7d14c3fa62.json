And Tamara Rojo is. Her Juliet enters as an adored, adorable child, but by act three she has aged a lifetime. Haggard, stumbling, slack with fear and rage, she is a woman peering into the abyss, and all the violence in Shakespeare's tragedy is focused in her body. It is an exceptional performance, and what makes its conclusion harrowing is that Rojo takes us there in convincing stages. The first glimpse we get of Juliet's appetite for danger comes with her introduction to Romeo at the Capulet ball. Dutifully restrained within the embrace of her fiance, Paris, she is suddenly moved into an awareness that she might have desires of her own. Vividly, Rojo shows it all in the dancing \u2013 the flirtatious boldness with which Juliet pushes the boundaries of her steps, the curiosity with which she reacts to Romeo's touch. Rojo delays the deep charge of sexual awareness until the final kiss of the balcony scene. But by this time, it is clear that Juliet is turning into a woman who dares to make her own decisions. And Rojo nails down the inevitability of the punishment she will suffer using the increasingly ragged urgency of her body language, defying her family even as she touchingly looks over her shoulder in the hope that someone will stop her. The men around Rojo give pretty good support. Rupert Pennefather, replacing an injured Carlos Acosta, has nothing like Rojo's intensity of focus. But in contrast to the other male characters \u2013 possessive Paris (David Pickering), vengeful Tybalt (Gary Avis), authoritarian Lord Capulet (Christopher Saunders) \u2013 his buoyant dancing offers a beguiling promise of freedom and fun. Of course Juliet would want him. He is the handsomest man in the room, and from the carefulness of his partnering and the ardour of his kissing (is it my imagination, or are ballet kisses getting more full-on?), Pennefather makes it very clear that his Romeo wants Juliet. The structure of Prokofiev's score also insists on a hefty padding of swordfights and crowd scenes. Given the frequency with which the Royal dance MacMillan's ballet, these have a tendency to deteriorate into routine mummery. But on opening night, much of the cast were on lively form. Best was Laura Morera, bringing fresh accents to the role of chief harlot, her dancing spliced with nose-thumbing sluttiness and whip-sharp aggression. Sergei Polunin graced the often invisible role of Benvolio with technical finesse, while Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn, a much scrappier dancer, was all banter and street smarts as Mercutio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
