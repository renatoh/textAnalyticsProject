The winger with the pre-Raphaelite hairstyle says that players such as Edgar Davids and Fernando Couto may have been guilty of nothing more than eating too much chicken. According to the former Manchester United midfielder, Italian poultry are pumped full of hormones to make them grow faster and this is finding its way into the players via their health-conscious, white-meat-rich diets. Rumours that officials first became suspicious when Jaap Stam sat on a ball in the corner of the dressing room and clucked fiercely when anyone tried to take it off him are unsubstantiated. Poborsky's fowl idea has been given little credence in Italy, not I suspect because it lacks scientific foundation but because it is nowhere near complex enough. Whereas the British, for reasons too obvious to need explanation, tend to favour the cock-up theory of history, the Italians usually prefer to believe that unseen forces are manipulating events in a fiendishly Byzantine manner (Within minutes of the World Cup draw in Busan I had received an email from a journalist in Turin telling me that Fifa had rigged the Group of Death simply in order to get rid of England and \"her hooligans\"). Simplicity has no place in the world of conspiracies. Here, more is more. Any true Italian football fan will surely believe that the Czech international came up with his chicken notion only after having his freezer filled to the gunnels with goodies by representatives of the organic food lobby. Italian fans are not alone in their belief in the sinister, of course. After watching Spain overcome Yugoslavia 4-3 in Euro 2000 I walked back into the centre of Bruges with a Serbian fan. He had a ready explanation for the Spaniards' thrilling last-minute win. \"Yugoslavia is a poor country,\" he said. \"Spain is a rich country, and so . . .\" he held up his right hand and rubbed the thumb across the tips of his fingers. It was exactly the same gesture a Romanian TV cameraman had offered two days earlier when quizzed on his national team's failure to beat Portugal. To argue against either man was to feel naive to the point of prudishness. Cynicism has a masculine swagger to it that faith in the integrity of officialdom can never hope to emulate. It is also much more comforting. Whereas England spent months agonised over what elimination from Euro 2000 told us about our coaching methods, our schools system and the imperfections of our national psychology, these fellows simply shrugged defeat off with the word \"corruption\" and got on with their lives, self-esteem undiminished. Perhaps there is something to be drawn from this. After all, it would surely be less painful for Manchester United fans to think that the recent run of poor results was not the end of an era but - to give a wildly implausible example - simply Sir Alex Ferguson's way of forcing down the share price so that his chums JP McManus and Charles Magnier could buy the club on the cheap, dump his old sparring partner Martin Edwards and install him as chief executive instead. Sadly the obsession of sports governing bodies with stamping out sharp practice militates against the lesson ever being fully learned. Nowhere is this truer than in the Sport of Kings. At one time doping and handicap-rigging offered the losing punter a comfortable cushion to fall back on. By cleaning up its act so thoroughly in recent years, the sport's ruling body has left the losing punter with no alternative but to confront his own incompetence and inadequacy. That is why Charlie Mann's claim that some British horses were being given EPO is to be welcomed. According to Mann they are easily recognisable because they go \"like runaway trains\", a simile that suggests that he has not being using public transport recently. If true, however, it at least suggests a possible solution to the lack of an approved test for EPO abuse in horses. The Jockey Club should simply scatter a layer of leaves across the track and apprehend any mount that comes to a grinding halt as it attempts to cross them. On the other hand, in the interests of the mental wellbeing of gamblers across the land, maybe they should just let the rumours float around for a little while unchallenged. And if they wanted to add to it by letting slip that a number of horses had recently been seen tucking into buckets of chicken wings, so much the better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
