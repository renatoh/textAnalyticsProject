Mayflower Corporation's profits slid from \u00a355.3m to \u00a350.2m last year. More than three-quarters of the dip is accounted for by a \u00a33.9m injection into the directors' pension pot. In the previous year only \u00a3433,000 had been set aside. The company, which once hit the headlines with an audacious attempt to buy the Rolls-Royce car company and prevent it slipping into foreign hands, also failed to meet its executive bonus targets. But the remuneration committee, headed by chairman Rupert Hambro, decided to reward the directors with a 45% share handout. He described the payouts as rewards for \"excellent results achieved under difficult market conditions.\" Mayflower investors have seen the share price fall from 200p to 80p. Shareholders are also likely to question why former prime minister John Major has been so handsomely rewarded as a non-executive director. Mr Major was paid \u00a3105,000 - some four times the normal fees for a non-executive. In return for this payment, Mr Major has only to turn up to four board meetings a year, unless the company has to call emergency meetings. One shareholder described the payments as \"disproportionately large\". Mayflower's employees have had a bad year. The company paid out \u00a33.1m in redundancy and reorganisation costs as 5% of the staff lost their jobs. The discretionary bonuses appear to contravene the company's remuneration policy, which states: \"The remuneration package should be clearly linked to the group's performance from which shareholders will benefit. In addition it seeks to align the interest of the directors with those of the shareholders ...\" A spokeswoman for Mayflower defended Mr Major's package by detailing his role in devising the company's strategy and his position on the audit committee. She added that he had travelled extensively on behalf of the company, met existing and potential clients, and provided advice on dealing with government departments. She said the pension award was justified because the contributions to the directors' retirement plans had fallen behind normal levels. The company had asked Bacon &amp; Woodrow to calculate the shortfall. Chief executive John Simpson was paid a standard contribution to his pension of \u00a3155,000 and awarded a \"catch-up\" contribution of \u00a32.2m. Joint managing director John Fleming received a regular contribution of \u00a3120,000 and a top-up of \u00a3774,000. The discretionary bonuses are paid in shares which can be accessed in two years' time. If the directors hold them for a further 12 months, the company will double the allocation. One City banker said: \"They have got into bad habits over the past seven years, paying themselves a lot of money. In 2000 it all came unstuck. The shareholders have seen their shares go down from 200p to 80p and the directors have hit the jackpot yet again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
