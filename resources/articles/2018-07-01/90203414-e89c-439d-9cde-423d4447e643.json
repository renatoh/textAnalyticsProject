Federal officials said on Tuesday that there was no terror link to Sunday\u2019s attack in which the lone gunman opened fire along a bustling avenue in the city, seemingly shooting at random at pedestrians and into shops and restaurants. \u201cAt this time, there is no national security nexus to the investigation,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Safety. The attack killed two people, a recent high school graduate Reese Fallon and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis. The 13 injured include six women and girls, as well as seven men. Authorities have not yet publicly speculated on the motive of the gunman, Faisal Hussain, or explained how he obtained the handgun used in the attack. In a statement, his family cited his lifelong struggle with depression and psychosis, noting that professional help, medication and therapy had failed to help him. \u201cWhile we did our best to seek help for him throughout his life of struggle and pain, we could never imagine that this would be his devastating and destructive end,\u201d they said. Friends described Hussain as quiet and polite. \u201cI can\u2019t put two and two together. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s him,\u201d Aamir Sukhera told reporters. Nearby police searched the apartment where Hussain lived with his parents and siblings, carrying out boxes of potential evidence. The gunman was found dead on Sunday night after he exchanged gunfire with police and fled, though it remains unclear whether he killed himself or was killed by police. As investigators dug through Hussain\u2019s life, the attack has prompted debate over whether Toronto \u2013 which has consistently ranked as one of the most secure major cities in North America \u2013 was becoming less safe. \u201cCan\u2019t believe the city I love is unraveling before my eyes because of the actions of a few sick people,\u201d Liberal city councillor Norm Kelly wrote on Twitter on Monday. Toronto has been rattled by a string of violent incidents this year. In April, 10 people were killed and more than a dozen injured when a driver in a van ploughed into pedestrians on a city sidewalk. The following month, more than a dozen people were injured after a homemade bomb ripped through an Indian restaurant in May in nearby Mississauga. The year started with the arrest of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur, now charged with the deaths of eight men, and the high-profile homicides of billionaires Barry and Honey Sherman. Gun violence has also tightened its grip on the city. Last month two sisters, ages five and nine, were shot while playing in a park. The two young girls survived, partly thanks to neighbours who used napkins to stem the bleeding. At the start of this month, two men were fatally gunned down in a brazen daytime shooting in the city\u2019s downtown core. So far this year 26 people have died from gun violence, a 59% increase from the same period last year. The number of shootings has risen 13%, according to police data. \u201cPeople now \u2013 whether you\u2019re walking on Queen Street, walking on the Danforth, walking on Yonge Street \u2013 are going to be looking over their shoulder,\u201d said Louis March, the founder of the Zero Gun Violence Movement in Toronto. On Tuesday, Toronto city council, led by Toroto mayor John Tory, began debating a range of measures aimed at tackling gun violence in the city. March and others have long lobbied the city\u2019s mayor to do more, arguing that the violence in the city disproportionately affects certain neighbourhoods. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at him for five years to address this issue,\u201d said March. \u201cNow all of a sudden it spills into what we call \u2018previously thought safe spaces\u2019 and now he\u2019s acting.\u201d Measures being considered by the city include bolstering mentoring programs, the purchase of 40 new CCTV cameras and a contentious listening technology that claims to be able to detect and report the sound of gunshots to police. \u201cI\u2019ve said for some time that the city has a gun problem, in that guns are far too readily available to far too many people,\u201d Tory said on Monday. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard me ask the question of why anybody would need to buy 10 or 20 guns, which they can lawfully do under the present laws,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd that leads to another question we need to discuss: why does anyone in this city need to have a gun at all?\u201d March urged the city to instead tackle the root causes of this gun violence, citing populations where poverty and violence have become normalised, exacerbating mental health and addiction issues as well as unemployment. \u201cIt\u2019s painful to see because in every one of these shootings there was an intervention point, where a service agency didn\u2019t do what they were supposed to do. A government institution didn\u2019t do what they were supposed to do, or they delayed because the people weren\u2019t living in the right postal code,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the violence that we\u2019re seeing right now, it has to happen. You can\u2019t do this to people and expect them to walk around with a smile on their face, shaking everybody\u2019s hands.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
