They say that recent surveys of several populations of great apes have revealed devastating drops in numbers and that protective steps must now be taken as a matter of urgency. One report, published last week, revealed that numbers of Grauer\u2019s gorilla, the largest of all the great apes, had plunged from 17,000 to fewer than 4,000 over the past 20 years. Other reports have said that devastating forest fires in Indonesia, in addition to the spread of palm oil plantations, have wiped out thousands of square miles of rainforest, the home of the orang-utan. Again, species numbers have plummeted. \u201cSeveral factors are involved in the terrible losses that are occurring in our fellow great apes,\u201d said Peter Walsh, a primate ecologist at Cambridge. \u201cHowever, diseases \u2013 some spread by humans \u2013 are the ones that we can do most about in the short term.\u201d Three main human-induced impacts are blamed for the devastation of great ape numbers in recent years: \u25a0 Habitat loss. Swaths of jungle in Asia have been turned to palm oil plantations and have brought the orang-utan to the edge of extinction in many areas. Now oil companies are eyeing up central Africa for similar treatment; \u25a0 Bushmeat. Eating chimpanzee and gorilla meat has become a widespread source of protein in several countries in central Africa and has depleted numbers further; \u25a0 Disease. Epidemics such as Ebola fever have affected humans, but also chimps and gorillas. The latter suffered a death toll of tens of thousands during the last outbreak. In addition, the sale of baby chimps and gorillas to China \u2013 where they are being bought as pets \u2013 has emerged as a new threat in the past few years. In each case, serious depletion of great ape numbers has occurred, undermining decades of conservation work by primatologists such as Jane Goodall, who has worked extensively with chimpanzees. However, it is the danger of disease that most alarms scientists, including Walsh. \u201cI did a survey of the impact of Ebola over the past 20 years and found that about a third of the world\u2019s gorillas were wiped out by the disease. It also badly affected chimpanzees. The key point is that the disease \u2013 which was probably spread by bats \u2013 killed gorillas and chimps in remote strongholds where we thought they were safe.\u201d The problems facing the great apes are alarming, but scientists stress that there are still reasons for optimism. Chris Ransom, the conservation programmes manager for West Africa at the London Zoological Society, was one of a group of scientists who discovered several years ago that the cross-river gorilla \u2013 then thought to be extinct \u2013 had survived in small numbers on the Nigeria-Cameroon border. \u201cWe now think there are about 300 left in the wild. Once we thought there were none. So there is some ground for cheer,\u201d said Ransom. In addition, two small populations of mountain gorillas in Uganda and Rwanda are also thriving. These groups are the focus of a major wildlife tourism industry that has been hailed as playing a key role in protecting great apes. \u201cThat tourism has brought money and jobs to the countries,\u201d said Walsh. \u201cGorillas are seen as an investment to protect.\u201d There is a downside to this story, however. Tourists also bring in germs. Guides have got around this by providing visitors with face masks and they impose guidelines to prevent people with colds, or possibly other viruses from getting near apes. \u201cNevertheless, there is always going to be a risk of passing on germs from humans to apes,\u201d added Ransom. This point was stressed by Walsh. \u201cOur research has made it clear that viruses such as Ebola can affect gorillas and chimps, as can human respiratory viruses. We need to protect them against these viruses \u2013 using oral vaccines. And that is what we plan to do this summer. We are going to do a trial on an Ebola vaccine on great apes. We will leave out bait in the form of food that contains the vaccine. Within five years, I would want all gorillas and chimpanzees that come anywhere near humans to be vaccinated against Ebola or respiratory diseases. That is the only way we can go.\u201d Dr Carlos Drew, the director of the global species programme at WWF International, said he hoped it would be possible to develop a vaccine in the form of an attenuated Ebola virus that would then spread between individual animals, and so allow protection against the disease to pass through groups without the need for further vaccination. \u201cIn about a year, we hope we will be able to announce concrete plans to carry out such a programme,\u201d said Drew. \u201cCertainly we have to act soon.\u201d This argument was backed by Walsh. \u201cUnless we do something now, great apes will no longer be part of the functioning ecosystems of Africa or of Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir populations will be so small and isolated, and they will have to be managed so carefully, that they will only be able to exist on land that is run like a zoo or a park. Ecologically, they will be extinct \u2013 which makes what we do now so important and so urgent.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
