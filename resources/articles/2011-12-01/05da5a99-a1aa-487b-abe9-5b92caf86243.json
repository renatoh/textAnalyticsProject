Steven Fletcher's goal was ruled out for offside, Wolverhampton Wanderers were denied the late winner that would have provided their season with the shot in the arm it so badly needs and McCarthy was left to reflect on the sight of more home points slipping through his fingers. With three of their next four Premier League matches against Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 the other fixture in the quartet is a relegation battle at Bolton Wanderers on New Year's Eve \u2013 the two home games in the space of four days, against Stoke City on Saturday and Norwich City in this match, felt like the calm before the storm. Wolves badly needed to pick up a couple of positive results to give them some breathing space. Instead they have only one point to show for their efforts and sit just two places above the relegation zone. Not that they could complain about the outcome here or Stephen Child's decision to give Fletcher offside. A Norwich side that twice led, first through the former Wolves player Andrew Surman and later when Simeon Jackson scored within seconds of coming off the substitutes' bench, fully deserved a draw. McCarthy accepted that much and also conceded that Child was spot on with his excellent call. \"At the end it was a bit crazy,\" the Wolves manager said, alluding to the frantic finish that included Adam Hammill being denied by John Ruddy. \"We had an offside decision which was borderline but it was offside. It would be nice to get a borderline decision but that would have been hugely unfair on Paul on his team.\" The sobering reality for McCarthy is that for all the resilience his side showed at times against Norwich, Wolves have only picked up two points at home against the three promoted clubs. The bigger picture \u2013 two victories from their past 15 league matches \u2013 is even more depressing. Norwich can feel much more satisfied. They remain ninth and go into the Christmas programme full of confidence after coming away from Goodison Park and Wolves with a couple of merited draws. Their gung-ho approach may be torturous for their manager, Paul Lambert, who punched the seat in the dugout in the closing minutes because his players continued to push for a third goal rather than settle for a point, but it makes for wonderful viewing. Surman's early goal was a beauty. The winger started the move by releasing Wes Hoolahan before continuing his run to meet the Irishman's centre with a flying header that sailed into the net against the club where he made only nine appearances before moving to Carrow Road 18 months ago. \"A sublime goal,\" Lambert said. Sylvan Ebanks-Blake vindicated McCarthy's decision to select him ahead of Kevin Doyle when he scruffily swept home in the 37th minute and for a period Wolves were on top. Yet it was Norwich that scored again, when Jackson tried to turn Steve Morison's centre in with one foot but ended up putting it in with the other, his first and second touches since coming on. The game looked to be up for Wolves but Ronald Zubar towered above Russell Martin to head in Nenad Milijas's corner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
