Shockwaves went across the globe last Sunday when the Glovers rocketed to No36 in the charts. Released to celebrate their FA Cup tie with Liverpool, Yeovil True - set to the music of Two Little Boys - was only on sale in the local WHSmith. \"We shifted 2,900 last week, and this week we've got it in Tesco's too,\" revealed a club spokesman. \"Sadly we're running out of copies though, and haven't got any plans to press more.\" So will they be challenging Peter Andre for top spot tomorrow? \"I very much doubt it.\" \u00b7More rock news, of a slightly more desperate nature, comes from Norwich. Rumours abound that Suffolk rockers and Brits heroes The Darkness are Canaries fans. \"There have been a few rumours about them recording a song or making a donation to the club but officially we have not heard anything,\" said City's well named PR man Joe Ferrari. \"If the rumours were to be true, we would be only too happy to talk to The Darkness about it.\" The same applies to U2, if they're available. \u00b7Ahmet Cakar is Turkey's most controversial football pundit, his verbal assaults on the game's biggest names making the former referee something of a hate figure. When asked recently whether he was worried about going too far, he responded: \"The worst they can do is kill me.\" And so, this week, Cakar was shot five times by an unknown assailant. He survived the murder attempt, and from his hospital bed, said he could name at least seven suspects for the attack. \"If I speak, this would cause an outcry,\" he said. \u00b7Ever wondered where Ian Holloway gets it from? Well, here are the QPR chairman David Davies' programme notes from last weekend: \"In a fairly dull Kingdom there were two players who were perfectly happy, because they had firm contracts. However, due to a shortage of beans, the two players were dispatched to far-flung kingdoms to ply their trade for other clubs. One of those clubs did not have two brass farthings to rub together, and rumours started about a deal after conversations with agents and a leading member of staff from the club, who then passed the story on to another journalist, who in turn leaked to the local media and the fans of the player's club were outraged.\" Sadly, due to space, we'll have to leave it there, but rest assured they all lived happily ever after. \u00b7Across the nation, fears of \"BBC tourists\" swamping the country and looking to watch telly for free abound. So it's a relief to hear of eastern Europeans getting rich, even if - like Levski Sofia - they won't be joining the EU come May. Liverpool's Uefa Cup adversaries have this week released their own brand of vodka, which might help fans in second-half collapses. The drink will be called Ultra Blue, after Levski's kit, and follows the release of official Levski condoms which, in retrospect, could have been given a better slogan than \"A solid defence\". paul.macinnes@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
