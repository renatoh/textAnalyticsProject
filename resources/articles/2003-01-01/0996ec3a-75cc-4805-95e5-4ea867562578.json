The minister of state, Margaret Hodge, retains it in her job title, but otherwise you struggle to find it in the piles of recent government policy papers. It has been replaced with a renewed focus on skills. The term \"skills\" is used in a more or less de-contextualised way, but clearly carries the smack of purposeful learning about it; the ratcheting up of the competitive capacity of \"UK plc\". It is not that the government has lost the plot on key elements of a lifelong learning strategy. The commitment to overcoming the legacy of the system's failure to furnish one in seven of the adult population with skills and confidence in literacy, numeracy and language is undimmed. Indeed, there is impressive progress towards hitting the government's first target, to get 750,000 people through national tests by 2004. There is patient work under way to map other evidence of progress and achievement, and to support activity to map how people can develop basic skills whilst pursuing other programmes of study. The comprehensive spending review brought much more money for post-school education and training, and with it a new national target - for 1 million more adults to gain level 2 qualifications by 2006, and a more stretching target for 2010. Both were welcome. The target recognised the challenge to strengthen intermediate skills in Britain, and the government's latest skills strategy is wrestling with the problem of finding the funding to pay for it. Neither individuals nor employers see any immediate rate of return for investing in level 2. So the state will need to find the money. But where from? Level 3 is the springboard for productivity gains, but again planners want to see more people gaining vocational qualifications equivalent to university entrance. And if you cut money from entry-level courses, or community-based adult learning, you cut off routes back into learning for many of the people turned off as youngsters. A third element of a lifelong learning policy is the commitment to learning for its own sake, for cultural enrichment and critical citizenship. Ivan Lewis, minister for adult skills, gave welcome reassurance to community-based adult educators in December that the government remained committed to supporting such provision. Again, Charles Clarke's grant letter to the Learning and Skills Council and the higher education strategy underline the continuing commitment to equality and diversity, and its determination to see participation widened to communities currently on the wrong side of the learning divide. Then there is Success for All, which holds out the prospect for a renewed focus on strengthening teaching and learning in post-school education. Finally, the long-overdue overhaul of qualifications, to allow for smaller passages of learning to be accredited, should improve things for adults. Given so much that is welcome, does it matter that the language of lifelong learning has been parked? I think so. First, the renewed focus on the education of young people seen in the higher education target - where expansion for the under-30s risks being secured at the expense of older learners - hardly squares with a policy which recognises that increasingly we use formal and informal learning to manage change and strengthen skills throughout our lives. Then there is the commitment in England (but thankfully not in Wales) to create distinct provision for 16-19s. So far as I can see the impact this may have on adult opportunities has yet to be worked through. However, the major problem lies in the failure to think through the impact of changing demography. As the pensions crisis demonstrates, there is an imminent bulge in the numbers expecting to leave the labour market over the next decade. They will leave significant skills gaps that can only be met by re-skilling the existing workforce. For those who cannot afford to retire, the need for updating will be even more intense. And once we have retired we can look forward to 20 or 30 years of healthy life, where we will need stimulus and learning opportunities to prolong our active citizenship. Not a word of this shapes the latest clutch of policy initiatives - so we risk not being ready to deal with the changes ahead. For that reason, and because the vision was generous and inclusive, we need to recover lifelong learning as the shaping principle of post-school provision. \u00b7 Alan Tuckett is director of the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
