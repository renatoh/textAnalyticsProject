Why not? We want to win everything this season and in my head I know it's possible because the team is still the same, the spirit is still the same and the desire is still the same,\" said the Portugal winger in the afterglow of winning the Fifa World Player of the Year award. \"The priorities are the Premier League and Champions League but it would be great to create history by winning all four.\" United host Wigan tonight at Old Trafford and Ronaldo is bullish that the champions, who then visit Bolton on Saturday, are firm favourites for the title. \"I think so. We're in a great position. We have to win our next two games. If we can do that, then I think it will be hard for anyone else to beat us. We know it's tough but we're very confident. \"I think we can dominate. Manchester has a lot of young players \u2013 myself included \u2013 and so the future for the club looks good. But we have to make sure we win more trophies. I want to be here, to be a part of the success that I believe lies ahead for this team. It's great to be a part of this fantastic club.\" Ronaldo hailed his achievement as a tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson's influence since he signed from Sporting Lisbon in 2003. Ferguson's renowned man-management skills persuaded Ronaldo to stay at United last summer instead of moving to Real Madrid. Ferguson said: \"The player must have the personal ambition, the desire and drive to succeed. But he also owes a lot to Manchester United for nurturing and encouraging him in the proper way at the right times.\" Despite Ronaldo now being the European and world player of the year, the Scot offers no preferential treatment. \"It's the same as he did when I first came as an 18-year-old,\" Ronaldo said. \"He's helped me so much. Last season he helped me in every aspect \u2013 passing, shooting, decision-making, everything. And I listen to him always because he has so much experience and taught some of the best players in the world. \"All the time he's giving me advice to make me better and better. This is what I try to do all the time. There is such a great spirit among the players at United. That is why the club has been so successful. The team comes first, not the individual.\" Ronaldo also admitted concern about whoever will succeed Ferguson and offered a hint that his own future at United is tied to the manager's. \"He is the coach and I listen to him. This is very important for me. The boss is the most important person at the club. When he leaves it's going to be very difficult to replace him. But, thankfully, this is not the time to think about this because right now he's in charge and everything is great.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
