In Appleton's absence Gary Bowyer took temporary charge of Blackburn for the last time. The draw leaves both sides in mid-table and Saunders and Appleton with much to do to fulfil their missions to gain promotion. Ten months ago these teams met in the Premier League as part of their ultimately futile fights against relegation and now, like dishevelled revellers ejected from a swanky nightspot, both are attempting to get back among the glitz. Previous attempts this season have already failed, with both clubs quickly aborting experiments with Scandinavian managers, Wolves sacking Stale Solbakken after four straight defeats and Blackburn dismissing Henning Berg after the Norwegian delivered a solitary win in 10 games in charge. They had been surprising appointments in the first place but the speed at which they were overturned did little to suggest these clubs had discovered the vision and wisdom that had been alarmingly absent as they staggered out of the Premier League. The new men in charge are supposed to be signs of fresh astuteness and stability but since neither counts a promotion among his managerial achievements \u2013 Saunders was relegated with Doncaster Rovers last season while Appleton went down with Portsmouth \u2013 supporters will need plenty of persuading that their clubs are on course to return to the top flight. This match gave them some cause for optimism. Wolves' woes under Solbakken stemmed from the incompatibility between his preferred playing style and the skills of his players. Saunders trumpeted his intention to deviate from the possession-based game favoured by the Dane and instead cultivate desire and dynamism. He has already warned that any player who fails to deliver will be ditched as he seeks to trim a 40-strong squad to 25 players. \"Nobody's safe,\" Saunders said. \"I was brought in here because something is wrong and I have to get to the bottom of that. But it could take me two years to thin out the squad and turn their salaries into class. We just have to keep getting results while I'm sieving through them. \"This was a brilliant start. The main thing was that every thing I asked for I got: determination, running, chasing, heading the ball out. Football is about getting good players to work hard and [not doing that] is the problem that they've had.\" For a long time it did not look like that would be enough. For all Wolves' energy, they created little in the first half other than a close-range Kevin Foley flick from a Bakary Sako cross. Jake Kean had to make a smart save. Moments after that Jordan Rhodes, who had squandered an earlier one-on-one opportunity, put Blackburn in front from the penalty spot after Sako tripped Ruben Rochina. Blackburn were slicker than their willing but crude hosts and controlled the remainder of the first half, though a 20-yard Rochina shot was their only other effort on target. Unlike during the glum Solbakken reign, Wolves remained full of vigour but their lack of guile was stark. Sako's dribbling and set pieces caused occasional trouble but they did not look like equalising until the substitute Jamie O'Hara fired in a long cross with his first touch and Roger Johnson eluded Blackburn's defenders to head home from six yards. That shoddy defending might be a good starting point for Appleton when he takes his first training session on Monday. \"I'm delighted that we've got a manager who can provide us with stability,\" said Bowyer, who will revert to managing Blackburn's reserves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
