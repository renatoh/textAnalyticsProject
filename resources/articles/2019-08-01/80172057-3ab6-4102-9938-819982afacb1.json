The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, was responding to criticism from Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), who in turn had been reacting to his comments last week suggesting that the UK crashing out of the EU could increase the chance of Ireland being reunited. Varadkar said: \u201cIn terms of fear, I think we should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit \u2026 [it] would have very serious impacts on the economy, north and south, and on Britain. It could have security implications as well and it could have constitutional implications. It\u2019s something that we have to prepare for nonetheless. It is something we should be afraid about.\u201d His comments came as the British chancellor, Sajid Javid, ordered HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to prioritise no-deal planning ahead of the planned exit date from the EU of 31 October. Javid wrote on Thursday to the outgoing HMRC chief executive, Sir Jonathan Thompson, demanding action to \u201cdeliver a functioning regime\u201d on the day the UK left the EU. In an indication of tensions about HMRC\u2019s attitude towards hard Brexit plans, Treasury sources said Javid\u2019s letter was an instruction to \u201cWhitehall\u2019s unruliest department\u201d to prepare for a no deal. \u201cHMRC must make no-deal preparation their absolute top priority as the UK prepares to exit the European Union on 31 October 2019, with or without a deal,\u201d the chancellor wrote. Varadkar has been outspoken about the risks he sees as inherent to such plans, leading the DUP, which supports a hard Brexit, to accuse him of not engaging helpfully. Foster accused Varadkar of behaving \u201ccrassly\u201d towards victims of the Northern Ireland conflict in the past after he said moderate unionists and nationalists could question being part of the UK if they were forced into a hard Brexit. Speaking in Kilkenny on Thursday, Varadkar replied: \u201cIn terms of engagement, I have never refused a meeting request from the DUP and never refused a phone call from Arlene either, and she has my number.\u201d He added that he had spoken to the new UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, and had invited him to Dublin to hold further discussions \u201cwithout any precondition\u201d. Johnson this week held a private dinner with senior DUP figures as he visited Northern Ireland for the first time since moving into No 10 Downing Street. Varadkar, asked whether he was worried about Johnson\u2019s ability to be impartial on Northern Ireland, said: \u201cI think that remains to be seen. He\u2019s only just started in the job and I think we need to give him a fair wind and a decent chance.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Good Friday agreement is very explicit that the sovereign government, the UK government, must be rigorously impartial in how it administers Northern Ireland, and we all need to respect the fact that the aspirations about unionist people and nationalist people are equal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
