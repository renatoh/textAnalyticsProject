Gray's final book, completed recently and entitled Coda, is to be published by Granta this autumn. It is yet another instalment of his diaries, written in the unselfconscious, wide-ranging style that readers of his Smoking Diaries trilogy have come to love. Though the new work chronicles his advancing lung cancer, it is also, Granta's publicist assures the Browser, a 'wonderfully funny book', and will no doubt be a fitting last word. His word is his bond Tired of the grinding poverty under which most writers labour, cult novelist Tao Lin has come up with an enterprising way of keeping the wolf from the door. Instead of the conventional book deal, he offered each of six investors a 10 per cent share in his next novel which, quelle chutzpah, isn't even finished yet. Perhaps inspired by Lin's talk of Hollywood deals and lifetime incomes, the shares sold out in a single day. 'People who buy shares will actually help me focus more,' he explained. 'I will work better if I have no obligations or responsibilities at all.' The Browser feels he too would work well with no responsibilities, and invites any potential investors to make themselves known. How Now, Brown? Gordon Brown is among the contributors to Now 366, a new collection of children's tales united by the curious, not to say random, conceit that all the stories are 366 words long. But the PM seems rather to have missed the point. Whereas the other 209 contributors - who include Anne Fine, Roddy Doyle and Michael Morpurgo - produced made-up stories, Brown wrote a memoir about reading his encyclopedia as a child. 'I know I'll never be an explorer or a great footballer, but I am quite happy as a politician,' he writes. Just now, you have to wonder even about that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
