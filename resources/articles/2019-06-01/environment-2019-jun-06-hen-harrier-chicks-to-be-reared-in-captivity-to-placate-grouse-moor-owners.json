Removing young hen harriers from nests on grouse moors is designed to prevent concentrations of the bird of prey on grouse shooting estates. Stopping hen harriers from feeding on young grouse is designed to reduce the illegal killing of the species, which is on the brink of extinction as a breeding bird in England. Last summer was the bird\u2019s most successful breeding season for more than a decade with 34 chicks fledged from nine nests across northern England. Natural England, the government\u2019s conservation watchdog, announced its brood management scheme would begin this summer with \u201cactive\u201d hen harrier nests meeting the criteria for chick removal and landowners willing to be part of the trial. The chicks would be raised in captivity and then released into suitable habitat away from grouse moors. The hen harrier tends to nest in clusters and proponents of the scheme argued that brood management provided reassurance to grouse moor owners that concentrations of hen harriers would not build up on their moors, predating grouse populations. This, it has been argued, would stop gamekeepers and others illegally killing the bird. Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: \u201cConservation and protection of the hen harrier is at the heart of what we are doing in licensing this trial of brood management. This decision takes forward but one element in a far broader recovery strategy for the species. \u201cNatural England is ready to take the next careful step, aware that the licensed activity and the research will rightly come under close scrutiny from the scientists on the advisory group, from ourselves as the licensing authority and by those both supportive of and opposed to this trial. \u201cWe, as an organisation, must pursue all options for an important bird such as the hen harrier, so that our children may enjoy this majestic species in the wild.\u201d Critics said the trial was appeasing the grouse shooting industry rather than tackling the illegal persecution of the bird. Mark Avery, a wildlife campaigner who launched an unsuccessful crowdfunded legal challenge against the trial, said: \u201cThis is a daft idea invented by grouse moor owners and of no use at all to hen harriers.\u201d Avery said he is currently appealing against the high court decision that found the trial to be legal. The RSPB has also applied for permission to appeal. Chris Corrigan, director of RSPB England, said: \u201cThis is disappointing to hear. As we\u2019ve said all along, brood management is the wrong tool to help restore hen harriers to their rightful place across the English landscape. The RSPB believes the first step in hen harrier recovery should be the ending of illegal persecution. The evidence is now clear that this is the main reason driving the decline of this iconic bird.\u201d Natural England\u2019s director of operations, James Diamond, said a scientific advisory group would monitor and evaluate the trial to \u201censure we learn as much as possible from this trial about the potential for brood management to be used as a conservation technique\u201d. Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, said:\u201cThere is a genuine will among land managers and landowners to ensure the success of the brood management scheme. We are all united in our goal to help restore the hen harrier population. It is very encouraging that there are suitable hen harrier nests and landowners willing to take part in the trial.\u201d Brood management is part of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\u2019 hen harrier recovery plan, supported by conservation groups including the International Centre for Birds of Prey and the Hawk &amp; Owl Trust. Other conservation charities, such as the RSPB, have pulled out of the plan in objection to brood management. A similar scheme to remove the eggs of threatened curlew and to rear young in captivity is under way in partnership with the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. Eggs \u2013 which would otherwise have to be destroyed to ensure aircraft safety \u2013 are being rescued from curlew nests close to runways on Ministry of Defence land, with the chicks later released into other suitable habitat in England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
