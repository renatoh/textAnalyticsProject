This means he will be unable to fulfil his lucrative Indian Premier League contract with the Deccan Chargers but he should be able to resume his Test career on 26 May, when England are scheduled to play Sri Lanka in Cardiff. The England medical staff confirmed Pietersen's injury upon his return to the UK following the recent one-day international series in Australia. The injury will continue to be managed throughout the World Cup and he will continue to participate in the tournament. The England and Wales Cricket Board's chief medical officer, Dr Nicholas Peirce, said: \"Following an MRI scan on his return to the UK after the Australia ODI series a diagnosis of a hernia was established. The nature of the injury is such that it can be managed for the duration of the World Cup. As the symptoms have been getting worse a decision has now been made that the appropriate course of action is for Kevin to undergo a routine operation upon his return to the UK.\" Pietersen said: \"I'm obviously extremely disappointed to have picked up this hernia injury, but I've been able to manage it so far throughout the World Cup and will continue to do so. \"Representing England in a World Cup is something I've been looking forward to for the past four years and I'm excited by the prospect of helping the team achieve something special here. I'm bitterly disappointed to be missing the IPL but can take comfort from the fact that I will be fit for the start of a very exciting English summer against Sri Lanka and India.\" Pietersen has been a qualified success in his new role as an opening batsman, threatening a major innings without quite producing one. England, short of explosive firepower in their batting line-up, would be greatly diminished without him. However, the most explosive batting of the tournament has so far come from another Kevin: O'Brien of Ireland. Maybe the Deccan Chargers will express an interest in him as a replacement for Pietersen. They certainly will if he can begin to reproduce some of the awesome power he displayed against England on Wednesday in Sunday's match in Bengaluru. In front of a sell-out crowd Ireland play India and suddenly this fixture is being anticipated with some relish here and over in Ireland. O'Brien has been besieged by well-wishers, including the Irish president, Mary McAleese. \"It's great to hear the Irish cricketing public are going mad back home,\" O'Brien said. \"The president rang our tour manager yesterday and I spoke to her for a couple of minutes.\" O'Brien recognises that the atmosphere in Bengaluru will be a little different against India. \"It's not every day you play in front of 40,000 screaming fans but it's no pressure at all. It won't affect the way I play. I'll be looking to get myself in on what is a pretty flat wicket and if the ball is there to be hit then I'm going to back myself to hit it. Phil Simmons is quite a relaxed coach when it comes to my game, he just tells me to get in and, once I'm in, to really attack\". After O'Brien's efforts agaisnt England this seems to represent a very sensible piece of advice from Ireland's coach. But it would be remarkable if Ireland made this their third close game in a row. The tournament desperately needs more matches with tight finishes. One was on the cards in Colombo today where there was the luxury of a heavyweight clash between Sri Lanka and Australia. The game was evenly balanced with Sri Lanka 146 for three in the 33rd over when the heavens opened. The match started boisterously with Shaun Tait and Tillakaratne Dilshan engaging in a frank exchange or two in the second over, which required the umpire Ian Gould to act as peacemaker. Thereafter, Kumar Sangakkara delivered a highly responsible captain's innings. He was 73 not out when the players left the field. Those sides watching on the mainland would have been interested in the qualities of the pitch. This was not Bengaluru or Nagpur. The ball was turning significantly for Australia. Admittedly neither Jason Krejza nor Steve Smith took a wicket, but it is a fair bet that the three Sri Lankan spinners chosen \u2013 Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis and Rangana Herath \u2013 might have been more successful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
