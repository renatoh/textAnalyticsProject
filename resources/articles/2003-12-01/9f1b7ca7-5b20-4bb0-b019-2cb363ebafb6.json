She got home from school during the final week before breaking up and said, \"I've got you some work.\" She'd spoken to the milkman on the way back and asked him if he needed someone, and he'd told her that actually, he did. It was the longest milk round in western Europe. We started at 6.30am on a Saturday morning and wouldn't finish until 3.30pm. On Sunday he said I could have a lie in, so he picked me up at 7am and we knocked off at 2 o'clock. And for that I got something like a fiver. To add insult to injury, on my first morning he asked my name and couldn't understand the reply. I said \"My name's Sanjeev\" and he went \"What?\" I said \"Sanjeev\" and he went \"Eh?\" So I said, \"Well you can call me Sanj\", but he said, \"That's far too complicated; I'm just going to call you Sam.\" So I said, \"I'll call you Horace then.\" We didn't last long. On the second weekend we parted by mutual agreement. Another summer I worked for BHS in its central London head office personnel department helping with clerical duties. The department of 20 was mostly filled with women, so I felt very grown up - no male competition. It was a great summer. I had cash from the job and all these women around me. The only other guy there was the boss who could only motivate himself if he thought there was a panic on. As long as he could come out of his office saying: \"I can't talk to you now - we've got a panic on,\" he'd be fine. If he thought the place was too quiet he would do something like deliberately hide a crucial file and ask someone to go and find it. When that person found it wasn't where it should be he'd say, \"What? It's not there? My God, we've got to find that file ...\" I went on to be a marketing manager at IBM . But I have to really like the product and computers weren't really sexy enough for me, so it was a relief to go into acting.
