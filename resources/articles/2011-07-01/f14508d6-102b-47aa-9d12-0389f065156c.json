A bunch of obnoxious and ignorant young Brits wearing inappropriate clothes visit developing countries where they moan about the bathroom facilities, say \"Oh my god\" at the poverty, and scream at the spiders. But then halfway through the week they undergo remarkable epiphanies, realising that perhaps there's more to life than Top Shop. There are tears and big hugs with their new adopted families, promises never to forget, and they fly home to Blighty better people. Holiday Hijack (Channel 4, Sunday) is just the latest in the genre. But the programme makers have done well to find Louise, Nathalie, Alex and Dan \u2013 the Brits \u2013 who reach new levels of ignorance and obnoxiousness. They're taken to Gambia, where their holiday starts in the five-star luxury they're accustomed to. But then, on day two, they're told they have visitors in the hotel reception. \"It might be something good, guys,\" says Louise. \"Good? Is it the Queen of Africa of something?\" says Nathalie. No, not the Queen of Africa. \"A local family are hijacking our Brits' glamorous trip to show them that there's more to holidays than lying by the pool,\" says Tamsin Grieg, narrating (one of the rules of shows like this is that they must have a voiceover by someone who used to be in Green Wing). Local woman Stella tells our young ambassadors that they're coming to stay with her and her family. \"In a house?\" asks Nathalie. \"Yes,\" says Stella. They even have houses in Gambia. \"Does it have a roof?\" asks Louise. \"Does it have a swimming pool?\" asks Nathalie. Yes and no, respectively. Dan is worried about cleanliness. \"They're not going to be as clean as us,\" he says. \"They don't have the things that we do like soaps and shower gels, hair gels and moisturisers and the after-suns and sun creams.\" In the last moments in their hotel, they glug down a bottle of champagne because it might be their last for a while. \"They can't not have alcohol,\" says Louise. \"That ridiculous.\" And then off they go to live with Stella in her mud house. And it goes pretty much according to the formula, something like this . . . OMG there are people with food on their heads! That's your kitchen, are you serious? There's no way I'm using my hand to wipe my arse. Don't you ever use forks? This is not razzle-dazzle, it's hell . . . Etc. They get to help out in the craft fair, and have to work in the fish market. (\"I've just painted my nails with my Chanel Rouge Noire and I'm picking up fish with their guts hanging out, it's madness!\") And then, round about day five, the transformation happens. Suddenly it's more like this . . . These people are so lovely and smiley, even though they don't have anything. I wouldn't have touched them before, for reasons of hygiene; now I'm holding an African baby and look how cute it is! It makes us realise how fortunate we are, and that's why we're now bawling our eyes out. From now on we're going to be different and better and not use so many towels when we go on holiday . . . Etc. It makes you swell with national pride. God, they're chumps. Not bad people \u2013 they're actually quite nice \u2013 just idiots. And a little part of me is thinking that sometimes on holiday you don't necessarily want to go and work in the local fish market (what about if you're a fishmonger?), and it's quite nice just to lie by the pool. Anyway, it was a lot more entertaining than Sugartown (BBC1, Sunday), a new three-part comedy drama set in a northern seaside town, now fading but once famous for its sticks of rock. If you were being polite you'd call it inoffensive. More honestly, it's lame, tired, predictable, unadventurous, dated and utterly uninteresting. \"Marriage, that's like for the rest of your life, or till death do you part, whichever comes first,\" says a character early on. And I'm afraid I failed to get much further. No, actually I didn't fail. Sugartown did. Miserably."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
