While Eriksson was mulling over whether to accept the opportunity to return to English football, Thaksin and his London-based representatives were preparing their formal takeover offer. The former Thai prime minister has provided evidence to City that he has the funds in place and the club have been led to believe that his position has not changed despite another \u00a3310m of his personal fortune being frozen yesterday. An anti-corruption committee investigating his time in the Thai government has now frozen around \u00a31.3bn worth of his money, as well as ordering him to return to his homeland to answer changes of concealing money. However, Thaksin is understood to have around the same amount in European accounts. City have not been deterred by Thaksin's past and the process of accepting the takeover bid and concluding all the legalities is not expected to take long. If everything goes according to plan, Thaksin and his representatives hope to be able to announce the appointment of Eriksson simultaneously. Keith Harris, the former Football League chairman, has taken on the role of Thaksin's chief head-hunter and, despite a strong denial last night from Eriksson's agent, Athole Still, there was confirmation from the Thai's officials that there had been two meetings in London over the last five days. Eriksson, out of work since leaving the England's coach job after the World Cup, is the favourite for the job - his discussions with Harris are said to have progressed encouragingly - and the bookmakers last night slashed the odds on him succeeding Stuart Pearce from 5-1 to 6-4. A poll on the Manchester Evening News website had 71% backing his appointment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
