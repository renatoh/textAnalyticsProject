The detectives investigating the murder of a young boy whose torso was found floating in the Thames today arrested 21 suspected people smugglers who may be linked to his death. Police believe that the unknown victim - who they have named Adam - had been mutilated in a ritualistic sacrifice linked to ancient fertility rites, possibly by the African black magic \"muti\" cult. This type of witchcraft is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, where Adam is thought to be from. Police suspect the killers may have been practising a rare variant of 'muti'. Muti killers tend to remove the genitals, breasts and extremities of their victims, as their screams release the 'magic' of the internal organs for the potions, but do not dismember their victims. British detectives believe the cult is being imported and its members are preying on vulnerable African children - like Adam - who are smuggled into this country on false documents, unknown to the authorities. Is the Pentagon getting into the futures market? Blue skies thinking is thriving at the Pentagon where officials plan to start an online futures trading market to help it anticipate terrorist attacks and assassinations. The initiative, called the Policy Analysis Market (Pam), will allow traders to place bets on, for example, a coup in Jordan or a biological attack on Israel. Critics say the concept, described by the Pentagon as a \"market for the future of the Middle East,\" is a \"sick idea\". But the Pentagon insists that futures markets have proved themselves good at predicting election results and are often better than expert opinions. Why is Tony Martin under investigation again? The Daily Mirror's \u00a3125,000 payment to Tony Martin has caused huge controversy about newspaper payments to criminals. Outlawed under the press complaints commission's code, unless there is a public interest defence, the payment is being investigated by the PCC and the government is looking at tightening up the law to stop criminals profiting from their crimes. Whatever the morality of the payment, Martin's fee still pales in comparison to other big newspaper deals. The Sun is reputed to have paid the Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs up to \u00a3250,000 for his story on his return to Britain. The Mirror paid Princess Diana's butler Paul Burrell \u00a3400,000 for his story after the court case accusing him of theft collapsed. What are Spanish practices? The dispute between British Airways management and staff continues (to have the entire issue explained, click here. Management have accused staff of indulging in 'Spanish practices' in the workplace. It's an odd phrase which, according to Brewer's Phrase and Fable, is almost uniquely used to describe industrial practices, and was in frequent use during the print workers' strike at Wapping. The term is believed to have been inspired by the practices of the Spanish Inquisition, and the Oxford English Dictionary cite Francis Walsingham as writing in 1584: \"The French King.. will prevent that, by any Spanish practices, she should be drawn to violate her faith.\" Is hitch-hiking a thing of the past? According to our correspondent Duncan Campbell it certainly seems that way in the United States. Fear of crime, and a rise in wealth are cited as reasons for the near disappearance of hitching in the home of Kerouac, but believe it or not the practice is still thriving elsewhere in the world, not least in Iran. Why did Nasser Hussain resign as captain of the England cricket team? Matthew Engel believes the news competes in shock value with Harold Wilson's resignation from No10 in 1976, so opinions on the cause of Hussain's leaving are understandably mixed. Engel thinks he chose to jump ship because he was still able to go \"on his own terms and in his own time\". Mike Selvey argues that Hussain's aggressive style had become incompatible with one-day captain Michael Vaughan's \"more liberal regime\". David Hopps suggests the die was cast after England's disastrous display on the first day of the Test last Thursday - while Lawrence Booth in The Spin claims Hussain should have walked before the series even started.
