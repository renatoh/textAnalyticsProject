The Spaniard was outspoken after the injury sustained by Leroy San\u00e9 at Cardiff in the FA Cup last weekend, while De Bruyne was reacting to challenges in the victory over West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday night \u2013 on him and his team-mate Brahim D\u00edaz, another incident Guardiola was vexed about. Guardiola said: \u201cI could repeat what I said after the [Cardiff] game but it\u2019s not necessary,\u201d after reviewing the tackle on D\u00edaz by Matt Phillips, but De Bruyne, who was caught by James McClean in the buildup to his goal, was more forthcoming. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the tackle was like that, I\u2019ve just seen it. Let\u2019s just say the ball was not in the neighbourhood,\u201d he said. \u201cThe referee told me he didn\u2019t touch me good enough to get the red card but obviously I told him: \u2018I saw the guy, I was jumping.\u2019\u201d In response to the question of whether teams were becoming frustrated with City\u2019s dominance, De Bruyne answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know what they are thinking \u2013 you can also pull a shirt, that\u2019s more effective than a tackle. Sometimes it gets frustrating. A lot of teams are making a lot of fouls against us. We make a foul, we get a yellow card, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible sometimes.\u201d De Bruyne fears City could become stretched if more of his team-mates were sidelined, with David Silva having to be replaced at half-time owing to injury. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of players \u2013 particularly among the forwards, now there is [Silva], maybe, today. We just have one player for each position \u2013 and hopefully it can stay like this and people can come back as quickly as possible.\u201d His team-mate Bernardo Silva was adamant after Wednesday\u2019s game that City are being targeted. \u201cWe hope that soon they start protecting our players because the way other teams are tackling our players it\u2019s not part of the game, it\u2019s not fair play,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
