The BBC Archive has put together a collection documenting the life of Elizabeth II back when she was just plain old Princess Elizabeth (pictured, right), including a newsreel of her marriage to Philip Mountbatten, a radio message from the Princess to the nation's children, and a rather gloomy eyewitness account of how she received the news of her father's death. BBC Archive Audio: Radiolab A typically frenzied edition of Radiolab, dealing with the topic of colours, begins with a story about Isaac Newton stabbing himself in the eye, and doesn't really let up from there. Gladstone, The Odyssey and colourblind monkeys all feature, obviously. Online TV: The London Markets The final part of an all-too-brief series on the changing fortunes of three of the capitals biggest markets airs this week, and focuses on the lives of fruit and veg traders in Spitalfields. The two previous installments, both of which are available on the iPlayer, have considered the futures of Billingsgate (fish) and Smithfield (meat). BBC iPlayer TV: Random Debbie Tucker Green's successful TV adaptation of her stage play concerning the impact of a sudden \"random\" tragedy on a family was the surprise winner of a TV Bafta last week. It's up on 4OD for those who missed it the first time round. 4OD TV: Evidently \u2026 John Cooper Clarke Punk poet John Cooper Clarke (pictured, right) has received a fair bit of exposure recently, guest-presenting A Month Of Sundays on 6Music, and featuring in the first episode of BBC4's Punk Britannia. There's also this documentary, which features figures as diverse as Bill Bailey and Plan B enthusing about the \"Bard of Salford\", interspersed with archive footage of the great man. BBC iPlayer TV: Alan Carr: Chatty Man By now anyone who has cast aspersions on Alan Carr's star status has surely been well and truly forced back into their box. This week's Summer Specstacular is the first of a pair of celeb-laden extravanganzas and features David Walliams and the terrifyingly popular Justin Bieber, among others. Catch up with the comedian's comparatively low-key Friday night chat show on 4OD. 4OD"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
