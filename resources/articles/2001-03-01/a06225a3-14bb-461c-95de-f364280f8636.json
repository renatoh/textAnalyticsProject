Ever the diplomat, Eriksson would probably put this acrimonious battle down to English \"fighting spirit\" - the well-worn euphemism for the physicality of the game here. Opposing centre-backs Rio Ferdinand - who subdued his prospective Finland opponent, Jonatan Johansson - and Richard Rufus may have enhanced their England claims, but managers and players alike spoke of manly virtues such as \"standing up to it\" and \"not rolling over\". They also claimed the referee and his officials \"lost it\". The truth is several players lost control and Clive Wilkes's only fault was not to issue red cards for two of the eight offences punished with cautions. There are two sides to Leeds - who also won the cautions contest 5-3 - and both were visible at the Valley. On the one hand the quick, flowing, footballing team admired especially for their European exploits. On the other, the over-physical, confrontational team still winning few friends outside West Yorkshire. No two people see a game the same way. Just ask a pair of Leeds players about this contest. Mark Viduka: \"It was a very rough game, one I didn't enjoy playing in.\" David Batty: \"I love these sort of games.\" Viduka took only 11 seconds to score his 19th goal of the season but 15 minutes later earned the game's first caution. The striker appeared to elbow the curiously put-upon youngster Scott Parker but claimed it was accidental. Batty was booked as he tried to pull Parker to his feet, while still being treated after the game's worst foul, a lunge from behind by Danny Mills, which earned the Charlton old boy a caution. Time for a euphemism from Charlton manager Alan Curbishley, who said he was \"disappointed\" with Mills's challenge. O'Leary was disappointed to have his team's approach questioned. \"I don't think anybody was over-physical - there were some strange decisions.\" It would surely have been a draw had Wilkes awarded a penalty when Mills chopped Johansson in the 89th minute. But after this game of opinions, the fact is that Leeds took three points to advance their European hopes while Charlton broke down on the route to the Continent with their first defeat since Boxing Day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
