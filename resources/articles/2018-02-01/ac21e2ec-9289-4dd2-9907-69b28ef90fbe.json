Woods, who insists he retains aspirations of playing for the US once again, has been named as one of Furyk\u2019s vice-captains. \u201cThe Ryder Cup is incredibly special to me,\u201d said Woods. \u201cI am thankful to once again serve as a Ryder Cup vice-captain and I thank Jim for his confidence, friendship and support. \u201cMy goal is to make the team but whatever happens over the course of this season, I will continue to do whatever I can to help us keep the cup. I\u2019m excited about the challenge.\u201d Woods thereby joins Steve Stricker and Davis Love III as assistants to Furyk, with the plan to name a further two. The 42-year-old Woods, who this week will play a third PGA Tour event of the season as he edges back to competitive action following multiple back surgeries, was part of Love\u2019s backroom team as the US swept Europe aside in 2016. Earlier, Woods was thought to have an indifferent attitude towards the Ryder Cup. \u201cTiger comes out as possibly a 23-year-old and is maybe expected to be a leader because he was the No 1 player in the world at the time,\u201d Furyk said. \u201cMaybe his role, maybe giving veterans a little respect and letting them lead the team was perceived as a backseat. Now you fast forward and he was so animated and anxious to be a part of our Ryder Cup committee about helping to mould our future. Now he is excited about being a vice-captain, both for Davis Love in 2016 and Steve Stricker last year at the Presidents Cup. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that [indifference] was probably perception. I saw the fire, I saw how excited he was to play alongside him as a team-mate, I saw that also as a partner in fourball and foursome matches. I\u2019ve enjoyed the camaraderie and I\u2019ve enjoyed working alongside him as a vice-captain. So it\u2019s great to have him.\u201d Woods, who missed the cut in last week\u2019s Genesis Open, will have Patton Kizzire and Brandt Snedeker for company in the opening two rounds of the Honda Classic from Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
