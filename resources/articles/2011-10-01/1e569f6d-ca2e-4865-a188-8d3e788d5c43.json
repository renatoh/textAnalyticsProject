This weekend a visitor told to present themselves at the \"main gate\" might face a moment's confusion. By far the biggest gate, dwarfing everything else at the entrance to the film studios in Buckinghamshire, is a huge wooden affair, reached by a drawbridge. A portcullis is suspended above it and a pair of crenellated stone towers stand on either side. It is part of the set constructed for Snow White and The Huntsman, one of a succession of big budget films that have queued up to get inside a production centre that is unrivalled, not just in Britain, but across the world. The film, directed by Rupert Sanders, will star Charlize Theron as The Evil Queen, but the Oscar-winning actress is far from the only international talent working at Pinewood this weekend as the studios reach their 75th birthday. The studios' bosses, Michael Grade and Ivan Dunleavy, are throwing a party in the unseasonal heat. A marquee has been erected in a car park next to the original white studio HQ and there is birthday cake and tea. \"It is an amazing place,\" said Grade, the chairman of Pinewood Shepperton. \"Because of the unique facilities we have, the group is probably the leading dedicated studio manager operator anywhere. We have everything.\" And that, of course, includes a water tank for nautical scenes, and a helipad. To demonstrate a commitment to British film as Pinewood reaches such a venerable age, the studios have announced investment in Last Passenger, starring Dougray Scott, which will be former EastEnders star Kara Tointon's first film. Described as a \"claustrophobic thriller\", it is the first collaboration between the British Film Institute and the studios, which plan to invest in a few homegrown independent films each year. Grade feels it may answer criticisms that Pinewood and its sister in Shepperton are both now so successful it is hard for smaller-scale British films to get a look in. \"Well, we are not going to keep one stage open here for small British films then turn away a huge Hollywood blockbuster. British films have to queue up like anyone else. But we have started investing in British film. We are putting something back,\" he said. The Snow White set on the North Lot is right next to the block known as Stage 007, a name that gives one of many nods to the studios' close association with the James Bond films. Around the corner is a road named after Cubby Broccoli, the late producer of the franchise, while the main spine running through the complex is called Goldfinger Avenue. This weekend the Bond connection is closer than usual, because, although there has been no official announcement, Sam Mendes, has begun filming Bond 23 on site. \"I can't believe we are on number 23,\" says Grade. \"As a young man for me the new Bond was the hot date film and it is still the same.\" In their heyday the studios produced David Lean's Great Expectations and Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus, but were also home to popular comedies such as Doctor in the House and the Carry On films. These are small fry, though, compared to the film franchises Pinewood has hosted since, from Harry Potter, to Batman, Bond and Pirates of the Caribbean.\"Sequels are safer options,\" said Grade. \"You are always looking to reduce risk and a title that nobody has heard of is always a risk.\" In the middle of the site sit two equally busy TV facilities: homes to the BBC programmes The Weakest Link and, until recently, My Family. At Pinewood there is a deliberate blurring of the lines between small screen and big screen worlds. Studio space is used by both \"sides\" when necessary to make sure nothing is empty. Lord Grade, a former chairman of the BBC, thinks this is a lesson British studios should have learned earlier, as many of the Hollywood studios did: \"Ivan and I introduced television. It was simply a new customer base and I always believed the film industry should not have seen the TV as an enemy.\" The chairman also loves the mixing of the different tradesmen and women on the studio lots; like the retired Pinewood worker at the party who started as a \"gaffer\" in the early days and told Grade he could never bear to take a day off sick. Across the site are 300 other small businesses all serving the main cause: entertainment. These range from special effects, lighting and catering, of course, but also take in pay-roll services, T-shirt printers for the crew and laundry facilities. For Grade, what he calls the \"openness\" of the film sector is what makes it worth supporting. The highlight of the party on Friday afternoon is the installation of the refurbished Rank clock, complete with the famous, semi-clad gonging man. An additional thrill had been on the bill because Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton had promised to come by for cake. It was the last day of filming on Burton's new film, Dark Shadows, which stars Depp and Burton's partner, Helena Bonham Carter. However, filming was still going at an intense pace and Burton and Depp did not appear. Although he rarely ventures on set, Grade adores the atmosphere of Pinewood. He recalled being shocked to see Meryl Streep in her Margaret Thatcher outfit for the upcoming The Iron Lady. \"It looked so real,\" he said. The media mogul first visited Pinewood as a young theatrical agent when one of his firm's clients, Norman Wisdom, was making films there. He visited to see Morecambe and Wise on set too. \"I'd never seen the film process before. I was used to variety theatre, but I loved it.\" Then in the 1970s Grade tried and failed to mount a bid for the Rank Organisation, \"the idea being to create a Hollywood studio\". In 2000 he had a second chance when, with Dunleavy, he led a management buyout of Rank: \"Ivan and I saw the opportunity. Everybody else was getting out of the business, yet demand was increasing. And here we are now \u2013 though we owe a great deal to J Arthur Rank and his legacy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
