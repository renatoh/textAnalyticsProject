Already something niggles at the back of our minds. Something is not right. Something is missing. We will never see Jason Robinson play again. That's what it is. That is the source of our pain. Those dazzling feet, dancing their away through the carnage and across the codes, that bravery in isolation, those tries in red and white last century, that one in red in 2001, that one in white in 2003, that winning smile. He has left the field for good now. Reach out and open the nearest bottle. Rarely can anyone have united friend and foe in such admiration. They love him in league; they love him in union; even Down Under they reckon they could have found a place for him in their team. Which is not surprising. We will pass over the obvious qualities as a human being - the family values, God-loving yet mischievous, teetotal yet witty and normal. It was what made him abnormal that we are celebrating. He turned 17 the day he turned pro. Wigan beat his hometown Leeds to his signature and it was one of the best things they ever did. The lad would score 184 tries for them as they racked up five Championship/Super League titles, three Challenge Cups and a World Club Challenge title in the Robinson years. And then in 2000 it was to union for the second half of his imperious reign across two codes. Union was not too sure at first - of the wisdom of him or any of the other league stars being converted to the other side. But the code was convinced, seduced even, the moment Robinson rounded Chris Latham one night in Brisbane less than a year into his union career, setting in motion a rout for the Lions over Australia in the first Test of an ultimately doomed campaign. It was a moment of genius to leave one of union's finest full-backs flailing helplessly and one to sit easily in either code. What had made anyone think this man's brilliance was more suited to one or the other? OK, so he is a brilliant runner - but what about when the rain comes and the ball comes out of it from a great height, turning over and over, that suspended moment of trial and execution with the hooves of flankers and centres ringing in your ears, with not a team-mate around you? That was to prove easy as well: positioning sound, ball secured, maybe with a little leap, and safely recycled. Or maybe returned. Kicking was a skill he did not have when he crossed to union, but he has mastered it none the less, evidence of the dedication and zeal that has driven him towards a tally of more than 500 games across the two codes. 'His speed, his athleticism and his strength were always outstanding,' says Shaun Edwards, a team-mate at Wigan and these days in union himself as coach of Wasps. 'But what we possibly didn't know about was his resilience and how tough he was. And he is incredibly brave, which is why for me he is the most respected rugby player of either code. His unconventional style of play marked him out in union. I think there was a period when he was England captain when he possibly became a bit too orthodox, but I think he's got his balance right again now.' Too right as far as we are concerned, for now he leaves us, level-headed and at the pinnacle of his sport, after a life of highs and lows in the public eye, a troubled childhood and a manhood of trophies and glory, hence to return to his family and a bit of peace at last. He leaves the rest of us, if not quite bereft without him, at least reaching for that bottle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
