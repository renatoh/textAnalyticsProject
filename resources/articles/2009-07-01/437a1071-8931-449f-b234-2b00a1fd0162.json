A short period in an executive box at Worcester's New Road on Saturday finalising the team and then an hour or so chewing the fat with the Andys, Strauss and Flower. The announcement of the England squad for the first Ashes Test, at Old Trafford yesterday morning, contained no surprises. Thirteen players will go to Cardiff \u2013 the 11 who played against Warwickshire last week, plus Graham Onions and Ian Bell, both of whom played for the Lions against Australia at Worcester. It means no place has been found for Steve Harmison, who bowled excellently against the Australians, most notably in the manner of his twin dismissals of the young opener Phillip Hughes. There is no place either for Ryan Sidebottom, who will be left to get more miles in his legs with Nottinghamshire, with the message that he has to get his pace back up to that he enjoyed during the magnificent year when he carried the attack. At the age of 31, that might be asking a lot. The message to Adil Rashid is straightforward: there is huge potential as an all-rounder but for Tests against the best his wrist spin lacks the control to place a side under consistent pressure. The final construction of the side is still open to debate, however. The selectors could pick a bowling attack consisting of all four seamers and Graeme Swann as a single spinner. They could opt for three seamers, with Monty Panesar as a second spinner, in which case Onions would be the likeliest to miss out. Stuart Broad could also go, should it be felt the ball will hoop around, making the requisite length fuller. This year's batch of Dukes balls have swung more than usual, apparently. Broad's batting, however, still gives him an edge. Finally, in the unlikely event that runs rather than wickets are at a premium, an extra batsman could replace a seamer. All of this depends on a pitch which is and will remain an unknown quantity. Realistically, though, given that this is a showcase match for Cardiff and Wales, and given the commercial realities of the situation, it is almost certain that the teams will be forced to grind it out on what Harmison referred to last week as \"a chief executive's pitch\". That is something slow and low, made to go a distance and not result in lost revenue. Having ignored Harmison, Miller and the England management will be accused in some quarters of having delivered a snub. It is nothing of the sort. At his best, his pace, height and bounce from little short of a length mean he has been, and remains, the bowler in the world that top batsmen would least like to face. The problem has been that on all but the most rare occasions in the past four years, his best has been kept under lock and key in Ashington. No one has frustrated more and despite his continuing central contract, which will probably disappear at the end of this summer, Harmison was not included in the 16-man training squad before the Warwickshire game. However, he was included in the Lions match, thrown in to see what damage he might do to the opposition and to give England the chance to see if his Durham form could still be translated into something worthwhile. A more compelling scenario, however, is that far from ignoring him, a 14-man squad has already been chosen to embrace the first two Tests, the second of which begins at Lord's four days after the first is due to finish. At Lord's, the pitches have been unusually pacy and bouncy this summer and it might be that England will need a tall, back-of-a-length attack to balance the swing of Jimmy Anderson. Harmison will surely come into the mix there. In the meantime, rather than announce 14 names now and have him kick around, unused, he can return to his county for their Championship match with Yorkshire, which begins on Friday at Headingley, the venue for the fourth Test. Continuity of bowling is vital for Harmison. Onions has earned his place through county success (he is the leading wicket-taker this summer, with 54), and, persuasively, the manner in which he bowled to the Australians at Worcester. If it was Harmison who dismissed Hughes, then the contribution of Onions in not allowing the opener a single delivery of width, thereby denying him any boundaries to kick-start his innings, was estimable. He delivers from close to the stumps, so requires less movement than others to be effective, he can move the ball into left-handers and, with slippery pace, he is quicker than he looks. If, in a summer where Australia at least seem to think that reverse swing holds the key, Onions can master that art, he could be the next Simon Jones. The confidence shown in Panesar will stand him in good stead, for he is a player who clearly needs to be loved. He found rejection, and the difficulty of returning from the thrill of international cricket to second-division Northamptonshire, hard to handle. He will be reassured now. In the past he has been mollycoddled, with Michael Vaughan never feeling able to let him think for himself. Panesar would just set \"university fields\", Vaughan has said, disparagingly, but the former captain never gave Panesar the chance to prove him wrong and the spinner's development stagnated. If Strauss can find a way of encouraging Panesar to take responsibility without losing control of the situation, he could have a serious bowler on his hands once more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
