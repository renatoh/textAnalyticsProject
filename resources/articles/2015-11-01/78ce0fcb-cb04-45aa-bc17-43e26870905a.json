Keane resisted but O\u2019Neill tried again. They grappled, embraced, laughed. Manager had assistant almost in a headlock by the time Keane wriggled free again. It was that kind of night and this was the soft-focus Keane: no beard, no scowl, just a sunrise of a smile. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re not in Saipan, we\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said later, when asked about how the team would prepare for next summer\u2019s tournament. It had been the classic Ireland performance, full of fight-to-the-end endeavour, rigid discipline and downright stubbornness, culminating ultimately in a place in the European Championship and wonderful scenes at the final whistle when they could relax at last and reflect on one of the great nights of their modern era. O\u2019Neill\u2019s team gave everything. They chased every ball, never shirked a tackle and, when they needed a centre-forward to show composure and experience, they had a 32-year-old from Stoke City, with silver flecks in his hair, who passed the test with distinction. This is a team featuring three players from Championship clubs, a goalkeeper from West Ham\u2019s reserves and a back-up from Millwall, currently ninth in League One. The only constant theme has been their spirit of togetherness and Jon Walters, the epitome of that team ethic, talked later about it being the outstanding night in his professional life. His first goal was a penalty midway through the opening half and it was his volley, after 70 minutes, when the tension made way for a wave of euphoria. That was the moment the crowd knew that, barring a calamity, O\u2019Neill\u2019s men would be heading to France next summer and, considering the recent history of this team, they probably do not care a jot that there was an element of controversy attached to the win. Yes, there was some generous refereeing about the alleged handball offence that led to their penalty, but who could begrudge Ireland a dash of luck almost six years to the day since Thierry Henry\u2019s infamous handball helped set up the goal that prevented Giovanni Trapattoni\u2019s side reaching the 2010 World Cup? The bottom line was that this was a collective victory featuring all the old traits for which Ireland \u2013 and O\u2019Neill\u2019s teams \u2013 are renowned. They were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and their workload was prodigious. It helped that when the ball was played upfield to Walters it generally stuck, in the way that O\u2019Neill always demands from his front players, and Bosnia were allowed so little time on the ball they were simply unable to dictate their own tempo. There was only a concerted spell at the start of the second half when Bosnia put together some prolonged possession but, even then, Ireland\u2019s goalkeeper, Darren Randolph, was not called upon to make a noteworthy save. Shane Long, a second-half substitute, ran clear with an opportunity to make it 3-0 and, on chances created, there could be no argument they deserved the win, even if the penalty that put them on their way was harsh on their opponents. Ervin Zukanovic, the Bosnian adjudged to have handled Daryl Murphy\u2019s cross, was so close to the ball an argument could legitimately be made there was little he could do about it. The ball struck him, rather than the other way round, but the Dutch official, Bjorn Kuipers, ruled in favour of Ireland and that left Walters placing the ball on the penalty spot and looking up to see his former Stoke colleague Asmir Begovic in the goal. Walters kept the ball low, aiming to Begovic\u2019s right as the goalkeeper threw himself to the left. Ireland had lift-off and, for O\u2019Neill, the most encouraging part in the rest of the first half must have been how his team held off the possibility of a quick response. Bosnia were rushed into mistakes and, apart from one shot into the side-netting, Edin Dzeko was isolated in attack. It can be tricky in these fixtures sometimes to get the balance right between attacking and conservatism but Ireland judged it well and their second goal gave them the breathing space they desperately wanted. Emir Spahic\u2019s dangerous tackle on Walters \u2013 reckless enough to warrant a yellow card that would have seen him sent off \u2013 gave Brady the opportunity to swing in a free-kick from the left. A Bosnian defender applied the first touch but Walters was at the far post. His volley beat Begovic at the near post and O\u2019Neill was almost lost in the victory scrum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
