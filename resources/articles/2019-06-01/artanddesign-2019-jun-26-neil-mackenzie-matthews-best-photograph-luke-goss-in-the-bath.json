This picture of Luke was taken for Cosmopolitan towards the end of the 1990s. The magazine had done a famous portrait of Burt Reynolds on a bearskin rug in 1972 and I wanted this shoot with Luke to resurrect the idea of the male pin-up. It was something I\u2019d already had experience of because I\u2019d done a couple of calendars called the Blues Boys in the mid-80s \u2013 it was a company run by women who were sick of all the male-orientated pin-up calendars that were on the walls of garages. I initially shot Luke smoking a cigar, with just a towel hiding the crown jewels, and that shot was what ended up going in the magazine. But I wanted to try out something more jokey too, so I hired a roll-top bath and got Luke in it. We tried filling it with water but the plug didn\u2019t work properly. The studio was on the top floor of a block in Islington and the water dripped through into the office below \u2013 they came up to complain only to find a naked pop star in a bath. I always like photos that make you smile. I used to carry a bag of props around with me just to make photos more interesting \u2013 I\u2019ve shot Toyah wearing rabbit ears, Ian McCulloch with a bunch of carrots and Robert Smith up a tree. The band had broken up by the time of this picture and Luke was embarking on his acting career. He had no problem getting completely naked \u2013 although his missus was there, keeping an eye on him. The makeup artist had to strategically apply the bubbles. She didn\u2019t mind. In fact, I think she quite enjoyed her day! One of my biggest inspirations is the Hollywood portrait photographers of the 40s and 50s, who took those lovely pictures with little dapples of light. That\u2019s what I was going for here. I\u2019m self-taught and learned all about lighting from a book by Walter Nurnberg [Lighting for Photography: Means and Methods]. I use tungsten lights rather than flash lights so you can control where it lands better. You\u2019re trying to sculpt a 3D image within a 2D format. On this shot there\u2019s just a slit of light going across Luke\u2019s torso, which gets the shadows on the muscles. The lighting is what stops it looking too porny \u2013 if I\u2019d shot it with a full-on front flash it would have been a different story. I remember taking some Polaroids to show Luke and he said: \u201cOh my God, I look like I\u2019ve got a body.\u201d He actually had a good upper body but very skinny legs. That\u2019s why I turned him sideways and hid them in the bath. I had a good relationship with both Matt and Luke. They were ordinary teenage kids when I first met them, although as they got bigger they became a bit more precious and their timekeeping definitely got worse. They\u2019d turn up four hours late and we\u2019d have to then work until 3am. I watched the recent Bros documentary, which shocked me. At the beginning, when Matt was in his Las Vegas apartment talking about crystals, I thought: \u201cMy God, what\u2019s happened to him?\u201d But by the end I recognised them as the same people \u2013 especially their need to always break off and discuss things intensely. I didn\u2019t set out to be a photographer. My degree was in economics and I\u2019d envisaged maybe getting a job at the BBC, but a friend of mine was managing what was then the \u201cschool band\u201d, who turned out to be Spandau Ballet. I ended up shooting them and it all went from there. [The early 80s] was a great time for music, especially visually. I\u2019d actually forgotten about taking this picture. I only printed it recently when I was looking for pop-star images for a new book. It makes me smile because he\u2019s really going for it. I guess he had to \u2013 otherwise the whole thing might have looked a bit pathetic! CV Born: Hampstead, London, 1957 Training: None. I taught myself to take pictures, develop film and print as a hobby while looking for work after university. Luckily, my hobby became my job. Influences: When I first started it was the work of the Hollywood portrait photographers, such as George Hurrell and Angus McBean, as I loved their lighting. But now it can be anything from films to paintings to nature or everyday life. High point: When I had a portrait of Hugh Grant hanging in the John Kobal exhibition in the National Portrait Gallery. Low point: The slow demise of film and the rise of all things digital. Top tip: Try to be spontaneous. Many of my best shots are spur-of-the-moment ideas. \u2022 Snap!
