But legal aid is all that upholds the essential ideal that everyone must be able to defend their rights. Without it, recourse to the law would be the exclusive preserve of the rich. Reforms to the system, which began being phased-in yesterday, are thus of importance, even if the disenfranchised and frequently roguish nature of the clients removes much of the political sting. The initial case for reform sounded reasonable. First, it was important to get value out of a rising budget already higher than that in other countries. Secondly, rebalancing was needed to safeguard the money for everyday issues, such as housing and debt, which had been squeezed by the explosion of costs in that 1% of crown court cases in which half of all defence costs are accrued. Fat-cat barristers on such cases might not like it, but a better deal could be struck for everyone else. Yet when the Carter review's proposals emerged, amid some sensible changes were others which looked decidedly flawed. Just a few months later, they are being forced through, with only minimal modification and potentially serious consequences. No-one expects a lawyer to advise them to sign a contract which leaves a great deal up in the air. But that is what lawyers themselves are being asked to do, and therein lies the most immediate problem. For the new contract contains sweeping powers for the Legal Services Commission to vary its terms at short notice. Some legal aid lawyers, who often provide a dedicated service for modest pay, are refusing to sign up to such conditions, which means they will be barred from taking new cases. As we report today, instead of more support for everyday issues as promised, in places such as Lambeth, when it comes to housing and community care the risk is of an advice desert. Even if the immediate industrial-relations issue is dealt with, deeper problems look set to remain. The new rules aim to force firms to merge so they can pool overheads and cut costs. Even if that produces efficiencies in the end, it is hardly in keeping with prime ministerial talk about \"diversity of supply\" in services, and the transition will surely be painful. More fundamental is the planned move from per-hour to per-case flat fees. If the rewards are for cracking through cases, then those who cherry-pick simpler cases will gain at the expense of those specialists who put in extra hours with the very hardest to help. The government claims that there are safeguards against this, but it has yet to convince many in the field that these will work. If they do not, justice will be the loser."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
