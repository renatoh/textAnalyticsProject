Now in its third season of Thursday night concerts, this year's programme presents a huge range of ensembles and soloists, featuring music by composers from James Dillon to Michael Nyman. Manchester-based ensemble Psappha opened the series with pieces composed for the renowned new music group, The Fires of London, in the late 1970s and 80s. Maxwell Davies's Image, Reflection, Shadow uses the six-piece Fires line-up in an unusual way. Among the ensemble is a cimbalom, and the weird clankings of this Hungarian percussion instrument form the heart of the piece. The music is full of images of mirroring and transformation, while the sound of the cimbalom itself embodies this liquid, ever-changing soundworld: each note is an indefinite atmosphere of resonances, like the ripples from a stone thrown into a pool. But there was nothing impressionistic about Psappha's performance. The scherzo was vibrantly energetic, with a dance-like melody underpinned by Richard Casey's virtuosic piano-playing. The music of this vigorous dance was becalmed in the slow introduction to the final movement, another dramatic piece interrupted by a huge cimbalom cadenza. Percussionist Tim Williams was convincing in the unaccustomed role of cimbalomist, and the performance of the whole group was brilliantly idiomatic. Elliot Carter's Triple Duo splits the six players into three groups, who play against one another in different rhythmic metres throughout the piece. It's a showpiece, one of the composer's most extrovert works. If Psappha's performance did not match the character and style they found for Maxwell Davies, this was still a compelling interpretation. Philip Grange's austere Cimmerian Nocturne completed the programme: it is a dark-hued meditation that balances a sombre solo for bass clarinet with a violent barrage of drum writing."}, "isHosted": false}}}
