Ed Miliband could win an absolute majority according to the survey, which puts him on 35% \u2013 two points up on last week. The Conservatives have slipped by one point to 34%. If there was a uniform national swing \u2013 meaning the changes in each party\u2019s support from this poll were evenly applied to 2010 election results across all constituencies \u2013 Labour could win an overall majority. Ukip is on 14% while the Liberal Democrats and the Greens are tied on 6%. Pollsters at Opinium said it appears that the two main parties are statistically tied, with variations in recent weeks being within the bounds of statistical error. However, Cameron continues to lead the pack on approval ratings, they found. The latest poll has 40% saying they approve of his leadership, while 42% disapprove. Miliband is on 24% \u201capprove\u201d and 49% \u201cdisapprove\u201d. In the wake of the scandal surrounding former cabinet ministers Jack Straw and Malcolm Rifkind, and allegations that they were willing to work on behalf of a Chinese company for thousands of pounds a day, Opinium also asked a series of questions on MPs\u2019 pay. It found that 63% believe that MPs\u2019 current salary is high enough and shouldn\u2019t be increased. Nearly half (45%) say it\u2019s important to pay MPs enough to ensure they\u2019re not tempted to add to their income by taking secondary work. Two in five (40%) say they\u2019d be happy if the basic salary went up if it meant that MPs are banned from earning from outside parliament. Only a quarter (24%) say that most MPs can be trusted not to let their private financial interests influence how they do their jobs. Opinium Research carried out an online survey of 1,948 GB adults aged 18 and over from 24 to 26 February 2015. Results have been weighted to nationally representative criteria. Full tables and results are available here. This article was amended on 1 March to clarify that predictions of an absolute majority for Ed Miliband were based on a uniform national swing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
