Her passing radar was way off. 4 Maria Thorisdottir Another Chelsea player who struggled. Her clumsiness conceded the penalty that Hjelmseth saved. 5 Kristine Minde Exposed by Lucy Bronze\u2019s overlap for England\u2019s first goal and struggled throughout the night. 4 Karina S\u00e6vik Showed flashes of her passing quality but shift from left to right of midfield did not suit her. 5 Vilde B\u00f8e Risa Like the rest of her teammates, looked overawed and low on energy in Le Havre. 5 Ingrid Engen Seized on a number of loose English passes in midfield during Norway\u2019s best first-half spell. 6 Guro Reiten Chelsea\u2019s new signing took until the second half to make an impression. It didn\u2019t last. 5 Caroline Hansen Norway\u2019s star was only a fleeting threat to an England defence that kept her quiet. 5 Isabell Herlovsen Furthest forward for Norway, the target for teammates\u2019 long balls, hers was a lonely night. 6 Substitutes Lisa-Marie Karlseng Utland (for S\u00e6vik, 64) 5, Amalie Eikeland (for Reiten, 74) 5, Synne Hansen (for Wold, 86) N/A Star player: Ingrid Hjelmseth England Karen Bardsley Not kept busy but decisive when called upon. Made a fine low save from Herlovsen. 7 Lucy Bronze Her burst to the byline set up Scott\u2019s opener. Crashed in the third from 22 yards. An exemplary night. 9 Steph Houghton Outstanding. Untroubled by her ankle injury. Made two vital last-ditch interventions to avert danger. 8 Millie Bright Had recovered from illness to play. Tired after the break, making a couple of errors. 6 Demi Stokes Selected ahead of Alex Greenwood for her defensive qualities and lived up to that billing. 8 Jill Scott Registered the quickest goal of the tournament. Narrowly failed to score her second just before half-time. 8 Keira Walsh Loose in possession as England struggled to control midfield for periods of the first half. 6 Nikita Parris Highly dangerous, especially in the first half. Missed her second penalty of the tournament late on. 8 Fran Kirby By no means her best game for England but worked hard in a supporting role. 6 Toni Duggan A quiet first half on the left side of attack. Substituted in the 53rd minute. 6 Ellen White Swung at fresh air for Scott\u2019s goal but soon scored her fifth of the tournament. 8 Substitutes: Beth Mead (for Duggan, 54) 6, Georgia Stanway (for Kirby, 74) 6, Rachel Daly (for Parris, 88) N/A Star player: Lucy Bronze"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
