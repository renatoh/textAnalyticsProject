Just as well, for the lead tenor damaged his knee during rehearsals, requiring the production to be reworked around a limping Rodolfo with a walking-stick. You might think this would lend an extra edge of poignancy, as well as that 'show must go on' frisson palpable among the audience on such occasions. And so it did, most noticeably at the curtain call, when the recently deceased Mim\u00ec had to prop up her lover rather than the usual vice versa. The stick became the star of the final scene, making Rodolfo's offers of help to the dying Mim\u00ec even more affecting, adding deeper shame to one's guilty thoughts at the outset that it was the obvious prop to help kindle that stove in the Bohemians' freezing garret. It did not otherwise improve the performance of Italian tenor Roberto Aronica, who was thrillingly lusty in full spate but worryingly fragile sotto voce. The reverse was true of the Mim\u00ec of Chilean soprano Cristina Gallardo-Dom\u00e2s, visibly and vocally effortful when pulling out all the emotional stops. Franco Vassallo offered solid, stand-and-deliver support as Marcello, while American soprano Nicole Cabell made the most of Musetta, a sassy, sashaying temptress as full of feeling as of voice. Romanian-born conductor Christian Badea brought out the visceral detail of Puccini's score. The other highlight of this season's final week has been the return to the pit of Charles Mackerras for the second revival of David McVicar's 2006 Le nozze di Figaro. With so consummate a Mozartian in charge, stellar international casting ensured that this was the production's finest outing yet. There was no weak link among the principals, led by Ildebrando D'Arcangelo's beguiling Figaro and the sprightly Susannah of the rising Polish soprano Aleksandra Kurzak. The dastardly Count of Peter Mattei was perfectly complemented, after an uncertain start, by the radiant Countess of Barbara Frittoli. Apart from a few puzzling innovations, McVicar's assured staging helped these top-notch forces ensure this was high-octane Mozart as good as it gets. This week sees the arrival at the Royal Opera House of Damon Albarn's Monkey: Journey to the West, before Covent Garden joins ENO in devoting the summer to ballet. As the 114th season of the BBC Proms gets under way, meanwhile, Buxton is the latest stop on the European tour of Jonathan Miller's new Dido and Aeneas 1700, a commemoration of Purcell's 350th anniversary which I caught in London last month. As with his recent version of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo, Miller opts for a telling staging with plain-clothed principals aside from the menacing hoodies denoting the witches. Julia Gooding is a noble Dido, touchingly restrained in her Lament, with Michael George a resolute Aeneas, Joanne Lunn a pristine Belinda and the fine chorus relishing its mantra 'Destruction's our delight!' The main musical interest lies in Philip Pickett's choice of the original, full-length, theatrical version of the work, for which his superb New London Consort is supplemented with kettledrum, slide trumpet and serpent, an early version of the bassoon. The show reaches Birmingham and Glasgow next April during a serpent-stop tour from Spain to Luxembourg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
