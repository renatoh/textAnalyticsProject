An investigation into online markets that are flourishing during the pandemic also identified a West Yorkshire GP who was selling antibody tests to the public in an apparent breach of UK law. An anonymous Facebook page offering Covid-19 antibody testing kits for \u00a349.99 each, and saying it was raising funds to donate equipment to the NHS, linked to a website apparently administered by Youssef Beaini, a family doctor in Bradford. Contacted by the Guardian, Beaini, who has appeared on the Channel 5 series GPs: Behind Closed Doors, said he was unaware that UK law prohibited the sale of kits to the public and he would cease selling the equipment. Beaini has taken down a Facebook page called Coronavirus Antibody Tests that stated that for every four kits sold to the public, one would be donated to an NHS worker. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything illegal,\u201d Beaini said. \u201cNo one is testing us. We feel very anxious and nervous about this. We look with dread on what\u2019s happened in Italy. We want to do something but I want to stay within the rules.\u201d The GP\u2019s involvement in the sale of Covid-19 testing kits was uncovered by the Guardian\u2019s digital investigations team, a group of software engineers who have been tracking the online trade of Covid-19\u2013related products. The sale of coronavirus testing kits to people who are not medical professionals is prohibited, as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has not approved the tests\u2019 use at home. The agency said it is investigating a large number of allegations of \u201cnon-compliance\u201d relating to the selling of medical devices for use during the outbreak. Government laboratories have been evaluating antibody tests kits over the last week but have yet to find one that works. Health secretary Matt Hancock today repeated warnings not to use them at home, saying they could give \u201cfalse assurance\u201d. \u201cAt the moment we haven\u2019t got a reliable test,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cSaying to somebody we think you\u2019re immune because of this test result and they\u2019re not can be a really dangerous.\u201d Ventilators on eBay The Guardian also identified that eBay, the auctions website, appears to have facilitated the sale of two high value ventilators designed for use in intensive care units by sellers who seem to have no previous record of dealing in medical equipment. One, a Chinese machine, sold for \u00a312,800 on 26 March. The seller, who appears to specialise in second-hand TV parts and mobile phones, had previously received negative eBay reviews including one that warned \u201cdo not buy from this guy\u201d. The Guardian found a retailer in China selling the same kind of ventilator for $2,100 (\u00a31,609), a fraction of the eBay price. A spokesperson for eBay confirmed the item had been purchased and said if it does not arrive the buyer will be entitled to a refund. A second listing offering an identical machine from the same seller was removed permanently from the site as it was in breach of its medical devices policy and restrictions have now been placed on the seller\u2019s account. Another Chinese\u2013made ventilator was sold on eBay for \u00a38,790 on 20 March. Records suggest that vendor previously sold mobile phone cases before turning to antibacterial wipes. eBay said the seller had provided documentation to justify the sale, and had subsequently cancelled the transaction due to \u201clow stock\u201d. It said the buyer had received a full refund. \u201cWe are monitoring listings in this category extremely closely,\u201d said an eBay spokesperson. \u201cIf any listings are found to be in breach of our policies we will take the necessary action, which can include account suspension.\u201d The pandemic has led to a flurry of activity on Facebook. The platform pledged on 19 March to introduce a global ban on adverts for and sales of coronavirus-related products including test kits, masks, hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes. While Facebook has been rapidly removing paid advertising on the platform, it appears to have allowed some pages that produce banned ads to remain live, allowing sellers to continue promoting their products. On one morning this week, searches revealed 17 Facebook pages hawking Covid-19 test kits and 18 pages selling other forbidden products. The Facebook pages either promote products, link to external websites where they can be bought, or give phone numbers and other means of contact for vendors. One popular Facebook page, called Covid-19 Tests, which had 5,000 likes, offered visitors a dialogue box to contact the seller. The vendor responded to one message saying they had sold out but added: \u201cWill have more stock end week, I will send you a link. How many kits did you want?\u201d After being alerted by the Guardian, Facebook began deleting such pages as well as paid adverts. \u201cFacebook is focused on preventing the exploitation of this crisis for financial gain,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said. \u201cWe have removed millions of ads, posts, pages and Marketplace listings for the sale of masks, hand sanitiser, surface disinfecting wipes and Covid-19 test kits, including all of those shared with us by the Guardian.\u201d The MHRA is particularly worried about sales of rapid testing kits, which take 10 minutes and do not require laboratory analysis. They look similar to pregnancy test sticks and use a drop of blood taken from a finger prick to measure the presence of antibodies. Certain antibodies are a strong indication of whether a person has previously contracted Covid-19. Some test kits claim to have a CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) mark that denotes the product was approved by regulators. However, guidance issued by Public Health England states: \u201cThere are no CE-marked tests for home use and it is illegal to supply such products.\u201d These appear to be the tests that were being sold by Beaini, the Bradford GP, via a website that had no contact name, no phone number and no email or postal address. The Facebook page promoting Beaini\u2019s kits was also anonymous. It said it was run by \u201cemployees of state-run organisations who are on the frontline of coronavirus exposure from their jobs\u201d. It stated: \u201cWe have been offered for purchase a supply of fingerprick coronavirus testing kits and have distributed 16 of these for free to NHS staff. However, we need to cover costs and so some of these will now be available to the general public to buy.\u201d The Facebook page promised that for every four tests sold for \u00a349.99, one would be donated to NHS staff. The \u201cwellclinic\u201d website linked to from the Facebook page did not declare the name of the manufacturer of the test kits, meaning its claims about their certification and reliability were impossible to verify. Beaini declined to say whether NHS colleagues were involved in his kit-selling scheme or why he had chosen to sell the equipment via an anonymous Facebook page and website. He said he had bought some of the kits from China for \u00a320 each and donated 29 of so far to frontline workers. \u201cEverything has to stop immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get all the pages deleted and taken down so that no illegal activity can occur.\u201d He later said via email that only two kits had been sold to non-healthcare professionals, and those buyers had now been refunded and told to \u201cdisregard the results\u201d. He described the sale of the kits to the public as \u201can oversight\u201d. Chloroquine The Guardian\u2019s digital investigations team also discovered an apparent surge in sales on the dark web of chloroquine, after Donald Trump touted use of the anti-malarial drug for the treatment of Covid-19 despite concerns that its potential benefits are not yet proven. Established sellers of illegal recreational and prescription drugs on anonymous marketplaces such as Empire and Kingdom have now turned to advertising chloroquine as a cure for Covid-19. PowerHouse, a dark web merchant selling recreational drugs including MDMA and speed, posted five adverts for chloroquine on Empire last week. Another Empire seller was claiming the drug \u201ckills coronavirus\u201d. Alex Guirakhoo, a research analyst at the online security firm Digital Shadows, said the ads began appearing when Trump \u201cstarted saying it could be a fix\u201d. He said: \u201cYou have these sellers on Empire typically involved in selling drugs and all of a sudden they are selling face masks in bulk quantity of 6,000 pieces. Now it\u2019s the same people selling chloroquine.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
