If it succeeds, it has the power to reshape the Middle East. If, indeed, decades of hostility with its foe are about to end, America will have to readjust its relationship with its friends. No longer will their interests necessarily override all others in Washington. No longer will they march in lockstep. There is a long way to go before that happens and, as Barack Obama said, Geneva was just a start. The Geneva accord was only possible after both sides had made significant concessions. Iran agreed to take out of the equation, for now, its stock of 20%-enriched uranium, either by diluting it or converting it to oxide. It can be converted back, although that takes time, but that of itself takes off the table a major proliferation concern. Iran agreed not to install any more centrifuges, and to leave more than half of its existing centrifuges inoperable. It agreed not to fuel or commission the heavy-water reactor at Arak, and to accept daily visits by the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, including at the underground plant it built at Fordow. This not only rolls back a substantial amount of its uranium-enriching capability, it also means that it would be a lot harder to develop a bomb in secret, because the IAEA is now able to check Iran's nuclear fuel cycle at every stage. To build a bomb, Iran would have to build a completely separate covert fuel cycle \u2013 a hard task if the country is crawling with inspectors. The P5+1 countries also made concessions. Whatever the significance of the absence of \"nuclear rights\" in the final text, the accord accepted that Iran will continue to enrich low-level uranium for the foreseeable future. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, gave Iran a large financial carrot \u2013 releasing $4bn (\u00a32.5bn) in Iranian oil sales revenue from frozen accounts, suspending restrictions on trade in gold and petrochemicals. This is more than the paltry offers of car and plane parts made in previous rounds of negotiations. What happens now crucially depends on the ability of the deal brokers \u2013 Mr Kerry, Catherine Ashton, and Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister \u2013 to hold the ring and make their talks the only show in town. The strongest argument against the nay-sayers \u2013 the hawks in Congress, Israel, some Gulf states and also in Iran \u2013 is to question what alternative they offer, apart from propelling the Middle East into another war. Like it or not, the chemical weapons deal with Bashar al-Assad was far more intrusive and effective in ridding Syria of these hideous weapons than a tokenistic cruise missile strike would have been, and yet the Saudi government was openly contemptuous of its US ally for not bombing. Similarly, the ubiquitous presence of inspectors will make sure that Iran abides by its commitments in a way that the assassination of nuclear scientists can not. The use of force can delay but it cannot stop the inevitable. That can only be done with the consent of the Iranian leadership. If Congress goes on to pass another round of punitive sanctions, or Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli premier, makes good on his explicit military threats \u2013 he said on Sunday that Israel would not allow Iran to develop a military nuclear capability, period \u2013 the first casualty of militarism would be the current moderate leadership of Iran. Mr Zarif got the latitude he had in negotiating a deal with Mr Kerry only because the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, had President Hassan Rouhani's back. That can change. Other advisers can come to the fore, arguing (with some justice) that Colonel Gaddafi's Libya only became vulnerable to regime change once he had handed over his weapons of mass destruction. The virtuous circle started at Geneva can easily unwind, and it is in no one's interests, particularly Iran's neighbours in the Gulf, that that should happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
