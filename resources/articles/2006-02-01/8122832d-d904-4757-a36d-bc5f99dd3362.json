Bullies often are. That might explain why I've been getting so much stick from Down Under. 'When did you begin your campaign against Australian wine?' the editor of an Aussie trade magazine asked me recently - a classic 'When did you stop beating your wife?' type question. All I did was suggest that cheap Australian wine was in danger of turning into the Liebfraumilch of the 21st century. To listen to the response, you'd think I'd questioned the manhood of half the blokes in South Australia. 'Bloody Tim Atkin' is apparently how I was described at an industry conference Down Under. Don't worry, dear reader, I regard this as a badge of pride. Critics are supposed to criticise. For the record, I have nothing against Australia per se. I just think its basic commercial wines are nothing like as good as they used to be. Worse, Australia has bought into the agenda of the big supermarkets in the UK, constantly selling its wines on promotion to achieve sales. It is a sobering thought that an estimated 85 percent of Australian wine is sold in this way. You don't have to be Stephen Hawking to realise what this has done to the quality of the wine in the bottle. If you are constantly flogging a \u00a36.99 wine at \u00a35.49, or less, you'd lose money if you sourced wine that is really worth \u00a36.99. Likewise, any consumer who buys one of the big Aussie brands at its full retail price is a fool. It might not be on promotion this week, but it will be soon. There are exceptions to this rather depressing trend. I still think that brands such as Peter Lehmann, Jacob's Creek, St Hallett, Yalumba, d'Arenberg and Nepenthe are doing a great job of producing sub-\u00a38 wines that are as good as anything Australia has ever produced at the price. There are also signs that a younger generation is taking over in Australia, a generation that is alarmed by the consolidation of the Aussie wine industry and the poor quality of many of its basic wines. To be honest, I couldn't face tasting another line-up of big brands at the recent Australia Day Tastings. So I joined the throng at the Iconic Australia table instead. This line-up had been put together to highlight 'Australia's ultrapremium wine offer'. I know I was being a little elitist here. The cheapest wine on the table cost \u00a313.99, which is roughly \u00a39.50 above the average price of a bottle of Aussie wine in the UK. But no matter. I wanted to see if Australia is performing above \u00a310. I finished the tasting some two hours later with a smile on my face. The wines were well chosen and illustrated the complexity, diversity and downright quality of what Australia has to offer. You could put these wines up against similarly priced wines from anywhere in the world and they would hold their own. I could have chosen any one of a dozen great wines, but in the end I plumped for this outstanding quartet. The minerally, focused, lime-scented 2005 Grosset Polish Hill Riesling, Clare Valley (\u00a315.99, Oz Wines, 0845 450 1261; \u00a317.99 Philglas &amp; Swiggot, 020 7924 4494) provides further proof that Jeffrey Grosset is the greatest Riesling producer in the New World. From Western Australia, meanwhile, the toasty, herbal, beautifully crafted 2003 Suckfizzle Sauvignon/Semillon, Margaret River (\u00a315.99, Alliance Wines, 01505 506060) could go mano a mano with anything produced in Bordeaux. Two reds stood out. The 2002 Armstrong Vineyards Shiraz, Grampians (\u00a322.95, IntWine, 07841 420828) is a silky, minty, cool-climate Shiraz with Rh\u00f4ne-like restraint. And the structured, complex, bottle developed 2002 Penley Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, Coonawarra (\u00a325, Moreno Wines, 020 7286 0678) is one of the best Coonawarra Cabs bloody Tim Atkin has had in ages. tim.atkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
