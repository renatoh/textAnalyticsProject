Rancid are an American punk band; this song is particularly aggressive. And because I work for an organisation that fights the good fight against big business, this sets me up for work. I like 1 Trillion Dollars because that's obviously my average weekly wage ... I listen to Nights of the Living Dead because it's really a celebration of going out and having a wonderful night out after work, so it keeps me going through the day. It's a bit like that with the Wildhearts - at this time of year you need something that makes you think about the great little things in life. And this does. 1 Welcome to the Jungle Guns - N' Roses 2 Out of Control - Rancid 3 1 Trillion Dollars- Anti-Flag 4 Nights of the Living Dead - Tilly and the Wall 5 Vanilla Radio - The Wildhearts"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
