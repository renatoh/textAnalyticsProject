Keane sealed a loan move to Parkhead from Tottenham Hotspur on Monday, with the intervention of the Celtic majority shareholder, Dermot Desmond, taking care of the striker's \u00a368,000-a-week salary. The Republic of Ireland international's future at White Hart Lane is in doubt. Yet Tottenham would seek a major return on the \u00a312m they paid for Keane if selling him in the summer. That, plus the 29-year-old's wages, would seem to count Celtic out. \"It is probably unlikely, although I would never say never,\" said Mowbray of any permanent deal for Keane. \"Robbie has already shown his enthusiasm in training. He loves to play, so let us see how he enjoys playing over the next three or four months and we will assess things after that. \"You don't turn down quality like Robbie Keane when it comes along. It fits into the bigger picture; if the scenario comes along that Robbie doesn't sign for this club then surely there will have been a benefit of having him here. He will have shown the demands of a high-quality football player day in, day out. Hopefully other players will feed off that quality, even the way he handles himself in training.\" It had been suggested that Keane could even be handed the captaincy by Mowbray until the end of this season. The problematic nature of leadership at Celtic is highlighted by the fact five different players have worn the armband since the turn of the year. The manager claimed today that he had given no consideration to Keane as captain. Scott Brown, the midfielder who is only just returning from a long-term absence caused by an ankle problem, is Mowbray's choice to lead the team. \"Scott has a desire to win football games. A desire to win is part of his nature,\" said Mowbray. \"I see Scott Brown as an inspirational figure on the football field. He has led every team he has played for because of the way he runs, tackles and drives them on.\" Brown's tendency to collect yellow cards could be seen as a drawback to his new role but Mowbray has taken a different stance. An admission, perhaps, that the former Hibernian player has been made captain in an attempt to improve his level of maturity. \"Wouldn't it be great if this helped him. That would be my attitude. It would be great if the extra responsibility on the pitch made him a much better football player, a more disciplined football player. He has every attribute to be a top, top player.\" Mowbray takes Celtic to Dunfermline on Sunday for a Scottish Cup tie. Tuesday's league defeat at Kilmarnock, needless to say, merely increased the scrutiny on the former West Bromwich Albion manager. \"I am comfortable because I know the route I am on and the road we are going down.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
