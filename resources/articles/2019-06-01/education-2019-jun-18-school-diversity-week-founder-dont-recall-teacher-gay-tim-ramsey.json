And one of the boys on my table said, this guy is gay. He\u2019s a faggot.\u201d Ramsey already knew that he was gay, and that rejection set a tone that continued through his school and university years: it wasn\u2019t until he was 25 that he felt able to come out. And it\u2019s the hope of changing the climate around LGBT issues in schools, so today\u2019s pupils have a more positive experience than his own, that has led Ramsey to found School Diversity Week. This year (1-5 July) the programme will involve one in four secondary schools, as well as many primary schools, and take in more than a million pupils. It is not bad going for an initiative that is only in its fourth year. And yet, agrees Ramsey, these are depressing times for those interested in changing the climate around LGBT issues in the UK. Protests in Birmingham against the teaching of LGBT equality; Ann Widdecombe\u2019s comments about science finding a cure for homosexuality; and the backing of the one-time Tory leadership hopeful Esther McVey for allowing parents to withdraw their children from lessons around LGBT relationships are all, he says, disquieting. \u201cWhat many people don\u2019t appreciate is how it feels to be surrounded by these debates and controversy,\u201d he says. \u201cIn those Birmingham schools, for example, we could expect one in 10 pupils to be LGBT; and their first experience of these issues will be people protesting at their school gates.\u201d What\u2019s more, a survey commissioned by Just Like Us, the charity Ramsey set up, has found that almost nine in 10 LGBT young people have experienced anxiety (85%, compared with 56% for their non-LGBT peers), that LGBT young people are twice as likely to have experienced discrimination, and that three in four have experienced bullying (as opposed to 52% of their peers). Ramsey is 29: he\u2019d hoped that youngsters growing up these days would have an easier time of it than he did at Lancaster Royal Grammar, an 11-18 all-boys school. However, conversations with the young people who volunteer to go into schools for Just Like Us suggest otherwise. \u201cI\u2019m often struck by how similar our stories are,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a single teacher at school ever using the word \u2018gay\u2019. It really was the worst thing you could be. I was terrified of being the gay boy. I\u2019d known since the age of about six, but I never spoke about it, never opened up to anyone. It was an intensely lonely experience, and that\u2019s what leads to mental health issues.\u201d The point he wants to drive home is that LGBT issues \u201care everyone\u2019s business, because you can literally save someone\u2019s life by being there for them and supporting them\u201d. At his \u201cvery straight, laddish\u201d school he feigned illness to get out of sport, and didn\u2019t touch alcohol for fear of letting slip the truth about his sexuality. When he got to university things weren\u2019t much easier. \u201cI studied classics at Brasenose College, Oxford. I\u2019d imagined that I would finally be able to come out: but what I hadn\u2019t realised was that after seven years of creating an image of myself as straight, it was very difficult to overthrow that in an environment where, as a state school kid from the north, I already felt a bit of an outsider.\u201d When he eventually shared the truth with a university friend, his world came crashing down. \u201cI got very drunk, told a friend \u2013 and things didn\u2019t go at all well. \u201cI remember walking along a street in Oxford and I\u2019d smashed my phone into some glass and my hand was covered in blood. My friend had rejected me: it was the thing I\u2019d feared all these years. What I desperately needed was for someone to say, it\u2019s all going to be fine. That would have made a world of a difference. I was in such a mess, I can imagine things working out in a very different way.\u201d Ramsey\u2019s parents didn\u2019t have any gay friends, and LGBT issues weren\u2019t discussed at home. His family are close \u2013 he has one sister \u2013 but he says his parents, like many of their generation, had hoped his life would be an enhanced reflection of their own. This is another important part of the raison d\u2019etre of Just Like Us: because LGBT pupils, unlike those from other minorities, often lack support at home. \u201cMany minorities are something you\u2019re born into, but most gay children aren\u2019t born into LGBT+ families, so they have to find their own community. And that\u2019s why the culture around being gay in schools is so crucial, and can make a life-changing difference,\u201d he says. It\u2019s impossible, says Ramsey, to guarantee attitudes towards LGBT issues in the home \u2013 but it should certainly be possible to make schools safe and welcoming places for children, whatever their sexual orientation. After he eventually came out at the age of 25, Ramsey met a man called Ben with whom he shared a very similar background, but whose experience of being gay had been totally different. \u201cHe was like the person I could have been: he was grounded, and happy, and he\u2019d never had to be secretive about who he was.\u201d So what was the difference? \u201cOne important thing was that there was an openly gay teacher at his school. That made me realise how important role models are.\u201d Ramsey went back to speak at his old school, and off the back of that he launched Just Like Us, and then School Diversity Week. Schools that have signed up to Diversity Week can access an online toolkit with lesson ideas, says Ramsey; some schools run special assemblies, distribute rainbow badges, plant rainbow borders, or allow pupils to dress up in rainbow colours. \u201cIt\u2019s all about underlining the schools\u2019 respect for minority groups in general, and LGBT+ people in particular,\u201d he says. Those that have opted in to the week of action include Catholic and Church of England schools (making up 5% and 9% of the total number of schools respectively), and some schools with large numbers of Muslim pupils. \u201cOne school with a significant number of Muslim pupils that\u2019s been involved from the start is Woodbridge High School in Redbridge, and that was mentioned in its favour in an Ofsted report,\u201d he says. Ramsey is aware, though, that it is the schools that don\u2019t sign up which represent the challenge. \u201cThough taking part in the week can improve what schools are doing for LGBT+ pupils, those are the schools that are already aware of the issues,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very conscious that, though take-up of the week has been high, we\u2019ve got far fewer schools in Wales, North Yorkshire and Cumbria than other areas of the country. \u201cThere\u2019s a real urban/rural divide around all this: in parts of London you get people who genuinely think it\u2019s not even an issue, whereas in other parts of the country, schools haven\u2019t begun to address it.\u201d School Diversity Week this year is taking place throughout England and Wales; next year, Scottish schools will also be invited, and Northern Irish schools will be included at some point in the future. Ramsey knows there may be an uphill battle ahead in some areas but he also knows it is worth it. \u201cI want this to be something children in school don\u2019t need to even think about,\u201d he says. \u201cI want all schools to be places where all children can be themselves, fearlessly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
