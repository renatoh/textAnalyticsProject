European Union competition commissioner Mario Monti today said Brussels favoured one-year contracts for the type of exclusive rights deal that the Premier League has negotiated with BSkyB. \"The exclusivity of a contract does not necessarily hurt competition, but the duration and the scope can create more serious problems and shut down the market,\" Mr Monti said in a speech in Rome. \"With regard to duration, the Commission maintains that contracts of one season are generally acceptable,\" he added. His latest remarks hint the commission may be inching towards a compromise with the Premier League in its long running row over the way the league sells its rights. Within the next fortnight it is expected to issue a new \"statement of objections\" that puts League's deal with Sky in doubt. Privately BSkyB believes changes will be forced through - but not until the new contract expires. Mr Monti's comments today came as a surprise to the Premier League executives who point out that the commission has recently approved contracts in Germany and for the Uefa Champion's League that run to three years. BSkyB paid \u00a31.024bn for an exclusive three-year deal handing it the rights to 138 live games each season from next year, and further enraged Brussels competition authorities by then scooping the rights to delayed live broadcasts and internet footage. \"This is bad for competition on broadcasting markets and it is bad for consumers,\" Mr Monti declared in October - but today's comments suggest he may be prepared to allow Sky to retain exclusivity in return for cutting down the length of the deal. However, such a compromise would still hurt Premier League clubs because it would give them less certainty over the amount of money coming in. BSkyB will also expect to pay proportionally less for a shorter contract because it will not be able to spread the price of marketing or the significant production costs associated with covering live matches. According to those close to negotiations, there is also a suggestion that the Premier League could be forced to re-tender the new media package that was handed to BSkyB last month in return for allowing broadcast rights to remain with the broadcaster. The Premier League maintains it has co-operated with the commission all the way through the bidding process, and is prepared to go to court if necessary to protect its existing deal. League officials are still negotiating with the Brussels competition case team and say they remain hopeful of a \"satisfactory outcome\". It has argued live rights were put out to tender but that Sky easily outbid the competition, and that it was entitled to go with the highest bidder as long as it was a fair and open process. Under pressure from Brussels the League increased the number of live packages on offer from two to four - but BSkyB still scooped the lot by outbidding its cash-strapped competitors. Premier League officials and MPs have spent the last two months furiously lobbying European officials in a bid to diffuse the row. BBC director general and former Manchester United director Greg Dyke has also spoken out against the commission's involvement. \"I think the European Commission will break up the Sky monopoly on sport. And, when they do that, if they [Sky] don't give notice, half the football clubs will go bust,\" he said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
