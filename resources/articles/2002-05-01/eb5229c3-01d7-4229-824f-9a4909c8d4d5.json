But they quickly grew to adore him and he acquired cult status in his adopted country at the age of just 22. So, is he any good? He's certainly scored a few - 10 goals in just 12 games for Poland. And his predatory instincts in the penalty box for Polonia Warsaw led them to an unprecedented league and cup double. His talents did not go unnoticed in Europe and in 2001 he signed for another club with a reputation for open mindedness and racial tolerance amongst their fans; Panthanaikos. He was also reported to have attracted the interest of Arsenal earlier this year. Is he a predator for the young ladies as well? You re out of luck there girls, he married his Polish sweetheart last year. Bless. If he's really that good how come the Nigerians didn't notice him? It seems Polish football was considered so bad that the NFA completely overlooked him. So when the Poland top brass asked him to play for Poland, it didn't take much to convince him. The soccer-mad President Aleksander Kwasniewski even sped up his naturalisation so he could play in their first qualifier in August 2001. No one seemed to resent this special treatment, especially after he scored two goals. The Nigerians may resent it though, as the two teams could meet in the second round Are the other Poles up to his standards? Not really. Olisadebe and Jerzy Dudek are the only true world class Polish players. Poland fans should be concerned as the team has lost twice recently to Romania and Japan, and our Emmanuel was looking a bit rusty. If he's planning on meeting his blood brothers in the second round, he'll have to find a richer vein of form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
