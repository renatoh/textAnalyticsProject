The potentially volatile mix of Turkish and English fans in the country on the same day had prompted fears of trouble, but the Swiss authorities have raised no concerns or objections with the Football Association or British law enforcement authorities. So relaxed are the local authorities that they have postponed meetings with fans' groups until next week, though, in truth, they could not afford to object to the game - in 2008 Switzerland co-host the European Championship with Austria and will be expected to cope with up to four competitive games on any given day. With the two matches taking place 100 miles apart and the kick-off times precluding anyone attending both games, a meeting of hostile groups is unlikely. Most supporters seem as enthusiastic as Sven-Goran Eriksson about the \"home\" fixture, brokered by a sports management agency, despite the location. More than 8,000 official tickets go on sale today, with more than 10,000 fans having expressed an interest. Essex eye Lee Concerns that cricket's first-class counties might fritter the \u00a3220m windfall from Sky on overseas talent rather than use it to develop domestic successors to Flintoff and co will not be eased by the latest word on the circuit. Essex are thought to be considering offering a \u00a3250,000 contract to Brett Lee. He would fill the vacancy for a match- winning quick at Chelmsford, but will it help the search for the next Neil Foster? Splitting headache The Rugby Football Union's dispute with professional clubs seems certain to prompt more growing pains as the game tries to leave its amateur past behind. Some in the club game are suggesting that the governing body be split, with a division responsible for generating revenue and the England team separate from that which governs the wider game. The attraction of this to the clubs is that such a split would dilute the power of Francis Baron, the chief executive locking horns with Tom Walkinshaw, chair of Premier Rugby Ltd. It took more than 100 years of professionalism before Premier League chairmen started making similar suggestions about the FA; in rugby it has taken a little over 10. Orphan finds a home A welcome blow for supporters' rights was struck yesterday at the Arsenal AGM. Following a sustained campaign the Highbury board agreed to donate a single share worth \u00a34,600 to the club's Supporters' Trust. The so-called \"orphan share\" was identified by fans as going spare after an accounting anomaly left it unassigned in the wake of ITV increasing their shareholding to 9.9%. The board's largesse takes the trust's holding to a princely two shares. paul.kelso@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
