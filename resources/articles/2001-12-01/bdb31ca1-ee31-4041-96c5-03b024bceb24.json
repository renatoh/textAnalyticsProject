Woodgate attracted the scouts as a promising schoolboy midfielder in Middlesbrough. He played for Nunthorpe High School, Cleveland Boys and, crucially, Marton Boys' Club - a breeding ground for top-class talent on Teesside. He also attended Middlesbrough's Centre of Excellence in the early 1990s but instead of signing for his local league side - where his father, Alan, is a season-ticket holder - he decided to stay with Marton. And Middlesbrough missed out when he decided to try his luck with a club. The team he set his heart on was, unsurprisingly, Manchester United. He was invited for a trial at 14, thanks in no small part to his mentor at Marton, Ivor Hindman, the leader of the club's soccer section and a part-time scout for United, where manager Sir Alex Ferguson has a reputation for tight discipline and producing well-adjusted - perhaps even well-protected - young professionals. Who knows, at United he might have missed out on the notorious Middlesbrough drinking culture, his subsequent arrests in connection with more than one assault and, ultimately, his trial that jeopardised his Leeds and England career. As events at Hull Crown Court have illustrated, the impressionable Woodgate may well have benefited from Ferguson's keen regime. But, as Ron Bowen, the youth development officer at Middlesbrough disclosed, the interest soon ended. 'Ivor Hindman was a scout for United and Jonathan went down there for a trial but it came to nothing. I'm sure that was a disappointment. 'We offered him a place at Middlesbrough's Centre of Excellence. He first came to us from Marton Boys' at about 11 or 12. In those days we were only allowed to run teams at under-14 level against other professional teams and if boys didn't play for us on a Sunday then they could not come training with us during the week. He was one of four from Marton and Jonathan said \"No\" - he wanted to stay at Marton. 'At that age he was neither big nor outstanding. He was never any trouble to anyone at Middlesbrough FC although he could, at times, be a bit of a harum-scarum. It just didn't work out for young Woodgate at Middlesbrough.' Instead of Old Trafford or Boro, he joined Leeds and grew up in that city, but on his frequent trips back to Teesside he became part of the 'drinking culture' that former Boro and England midfielder Paul Merson found so distasteful. Merson cited the passion for alcohol as one reason for his demand for a move from Middlesbrough two seasons ago. Never the sharpest knife in the box, perhaps, he was not bright enough to work out the dangers his social circle might embrace. His own counsel in the aborted first trial at Hull described him as 'two short planks, and thick ones at that'. His nicknames among fellow players have included 'Village' - shorthand for village idiot. Certainly, Woodgate was sucked into the drinking culture . There seems little doubt that he was a personable young man when sober but became quite different in drink. As Woodgate became more successful, and earned more, he was seen regularly at Teesside's trendiest pubs. He had a reputation for 'flashing the cash', acting 'the big-I-am' on drinking nights in his home town. Favoured watering holes were The Dickens Inn, in Southfields Road, a few hundred yards from Middlesbrough's Central Mosque. The drinkers in there often included a healthy percentage of Asians. Woodgate, according to one regular, took \u00a320 notes from his wallet and set fire to them on at least one occasion in The Dickens Inn. Other bars on his circuit included Spensley's Emporium, run by a friend, Lee Spensley - also the licensee of the Dickens - and the Royal Exchange, a late-night bar housed directly under the A66 flyover at the end of Albert Road, close to Middlesbrough railway station. The Woodgate circle of friends were also regulars at Club M at the well-known Tall Trees nightspot in nearby Yarm. At The Dickens, pride of place is given over to Woodgate's autographed England No 4 shirt, framed behind glass and presented to the staff. Within a few feet is a script, ironic with Woodgate now facing \u00a31 million legal fees: 'When money's tight and hard to get, and your horse has also ran, When all you have is a heap of debt, A pint of beer's your only man'. Another carved sign close to Woodgate's shirt advises: 'All customers are treated as gentlemen (unless their behaviour demands otherwise)'. The Dickens Inn's younger clientele are barely beyond youth club age limits and it shows. Alcohol is sold at very competitive prices. Pints of lager and bitter go for well under \u00a31.50, Carling lager can be bought two-for-the-price-of-one on weekdays and a bar sign is helpful if the kids simply want to chill out: 'Free Drinking Water Available at The Bar'. The Dickens youth culture is underlined by the internet booths close to the pool table and the Cadbury's vending machine. There are neon lights everywhere advertising the beers available - not outside but inside the bar. The bar staff reflect their youthful customers. The barman wears a long-peaked baseball cap and denims; the barmaid wears fourth-form pigtails and a vest that struggles and fails to cover her ample midriff. One of the drinkers at the bar - 'two Carling, Bacardi Breezer and a vodka and Red Bull' - knew all about Woodgate. 'He's liked in here, the staff all like him but he can be a bit of a get at times,' he told me. 'He goes up to girls and says; \"Hello, I'm Jonathan Woodgate\". Do me a favour. But none of us thought he was a really bad lad.' Yet Woodgate was involved in a brawl in which another student was injured. Victim Gareth Cowen, aged 22, from County Durham, claims he still fears reprisals. The University of Teesside undergraduate was partying with pals in Middlesbrough one night in April, 1999, when his party were set upon. A fight erupted inside the Cornerhouse bar, a town-centre bar, which spilled out on to the street. Cowen was beaten and kicked by members of a gang,which included Woodgate and two of his friends. It is claimed that Woodgate tried to leave in a taxi before police arrived, but a friend of Cowen stood in the way of the cab until police turned up. Woodgate, who was injured, was arrested along with his two friends and held overnight at Middlesbrough Police Station. Cowen needed hospital treatment and his party realised who Woodgate was, but they decided not to make a formal complaint so the matter was never considered by the Crown Prosecution Service. When Woodgate was arrested after the Leeds attack, it is understood the Middlesbrough students were re-interviewed and a file was sent to the CPS who decided to take no further action. The incident suggests Woodgate's Jekyll-and-Hyde reputation is well-founded. He is regarded as a 'nice lad from a decent home' - until he's had a drink. Once fuelled, especially with old pals in Middlesbrough where booze is plentiful and cheap, darker forces take over. His antics got him banned from the University of Teesside student union - at the same college where Gareth Cowen was a student - after he and his friends were involved in scuffles inside the bar. Student Ryan Mallen, 21, who has completed a business studies degree course, said: 'Woodgate came into the union one night and I recognised him. I wasn't sure though if it was his Leeds team-mate Harry Kewell so a friend of mine went up to Woodgate and said: \"Are you Jonathan Woodgate?\" He replied \"F*** off\" right in my friend's face. That's no way to speak to anybody. Woodgate obviously thinks he's important and that he can say and do just what he likes which is how he got banned from the union, causing trouble.' Not the behaviour expected in the respectable Nunthorpe district where he grew up, a couple of miles south of the town's neon-lit bars. It defies Teesside's reputation for chemical works grime and pollution. It's all leafy avenues, golf clubs and 4x4s. Local estate agent Thirlwells advertise a so-so bungalow with twin garages and Tarmacadam front garden at \u00a3450,000 - on Teesside that is a fortune. His boyhood home was less ostentatious, a three-bedroom semi in the \u00a390,000 bracket where he lived with father, Alan, 56, a plumber, and mother, Ann, 54, a solicitor's secretary. They have never hidden the pride they have for their famous son but they were devastated when news broke of the vicious attack in Leeds. They asked as many people as possible who were close to the family not to talk publicly about their son. Marton Boys' Club's Ivor Hindman said: 'Jonathan's father has asked me not to speak about the boy and I have to respect that.' A friend said: 'Alan and Ann are very down-to-earth people who are naturally proud of Jonathan but, naturally, they were very distressed when they started getting news of this fight and that Jonathan was meant to be involved.' At his old school, Nunthorpe High, he got a reputation for being conceited about his blossoming football ability. But while he stood out among his Nunthorpe peers, he was considered average when compared to the region's best. At Marton Boys' Club, a mile or so down the road - and about \u00a3100,000 down the property scale - towards Middlesbrough town centre, Woodgate found a stiffer test. Stan Nixon, a noted worker with youth talent for both Middlesbrough and Newcastle United down the years, remembers Woodgate as a boy. 'He had a North East England schoolboy trial at Maiden Castle in Durham when he was about 13 or 14. He didn't make the final 20. It was a full-scale practice game but in those days he just didn't have the height.' Neil Radigan, 21, played with Woodgate for three seasons between 1993-96 for Marton. The team won league and cup treble honours with Woodgate playing in midfield. But it was only after he was snapped up by Leeds that he really grew - and was groomed as a defender. Radigan went on to play for Scarborough and Darlington before he was released. Radigan of Coulby Newham, Teesside, now plays non-league for Blyth Spartans as well as coaching at Middlesbrough's soccer academy. He says the Majestyk incident was out of character for Woodgate. 'He's a really friendly lad and whenever I see him he always asks how I'm doing, who am I playing for and he never talks about himself. Anyone who says Woody is big-headed doesn't know him.' Now, as Woodgate contemplates his community service sentence, just what was on the line at Hull? There's a weekly wage packet nudging \u00a315,000, Porsche 911 Carerra, Jeep Cherokee, and a silver BMW convertible - all with private registrations ending with his own JSW initials. Not to mention a converted \u00a3250,000 country home which he transformed into his very own 'bachelor pad' on the edge of the Cleveland countryside - a short drive from Middlesbrough and within easy range of Leeds. He came so close to losing all of that. And while old friends such as Neil Radigan see the good side of Woodgate, the trial judge, Mr Justice Henriques, was not convinced, telling the humbled figure in the dock: 'It is right you are no longer confident and brash.' Now that he retains his freedom - and his career - it is up to Woodgate to decide how he conducts himself in future. And just who his friends really are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
