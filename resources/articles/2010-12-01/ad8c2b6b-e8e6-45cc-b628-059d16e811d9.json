Image: Dan Logen, 26 August 2007 [velociraptorize]. Nikon D2X, 70-200 mm lens at 200 mm, ISO 250 f/6.3, 1/400 sec Question: This bird shares a common name with a number of others in the same family. What is that name and how did it get it? Response: This is a dusky turtle-dove, Streptopelia lugens. There are quite a few doves that are commonly known as turtle-doves, a name inspired by their deep, purring \"turrr, turrr\" song. Turtle-doves are the gift \"my true love gives to me\" on the second day of Christmas in the carol, \"The Twelve Days of Christmas.\" By the end of the song, the singer ends up with 2 football teams worth of them (that's soccer for you Americans). You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page. If you have bird images, video or mp3 files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative audience, feel free to email them to me for consideration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
