Wednesday, meanwhile, are mired in a five-game winless skid that includes a 3-1 home defeat at the hands of Cardiff. Throw in Hull's recent bargain acquisition of Billy Paynter (two goals in two games) and City ought to have the cutting edge at the KC Stadium. Manchester City to beat West Brom in the Premiership 1.25pts at 6-4 (Paddy Power) Flushed by their 5-2 humiliation of Charlton, City are now only bested by Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea in the top-flight goalscoring charts. Andrew Cole and Darius Vassell, the Addicks' tormentors-in-chief last Sunday, now have 12 league goals between them, and should take advantage of the second-worst defence in the Premiership. The Baggies do have the potential to upset the odds at the Hawthorns, as proved in recent wins over Arsenal and Everton, but any repeat of their inept attacking efforts against 10-man Fulham last week won't fill City with fear.
