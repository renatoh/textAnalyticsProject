The Londoner currently operates a similarly open-minded musical policy, only now it is mainly reggae and rock. It's a far mellower blend, with the six auxiliary musicians (guitar, bass, drums, two keyboards, plus ragga chatter Jucxi) gelling and jamming like seasoned professionals. Mushtaq is probably no less politicised today; it's just that he's found a different context within which to express his various humanitarian concerns. Mushtaq calls his music \"millennium blues\", but it is not quite that dark and urban, with precious little of the claustrophobic intensity of, say, Tricky's Pre-Millennium Tension. The material unveiled tonight from his forthcoming album, called simply Mushtaq, could have come from any period - which, depending on your viewpoint, makes it either timeless or old-fashioned. This is \"classic\" territory. Dey Don't Know features the descending sequence of electric piano notes from I Shot the Sheriff, while Supernatural is based around the chord progression to Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit. The best tracks are the ones where the purity and strength of an individual genre is preserved, such as the roots reggae of Rebel Music or the tough rhythms of Ordinary People (although even the latter has a snippet of the Specials' Ghost Town). When Mushtaq tries to appease an imaginary huge crossover audience, he merely offers ersatz versions of the original styles. There are moments to treasure, such as the Hendrix-style guitar flare-up during Supernatural, but they are lost in the rush to mish and mash. Like any sane bloke, Mushtaq is a champion of multiculturalism, and yet he is in some ways its victim. He grew up surrounded by numerous ethnic communities, exposed to their record collections, and it has left him with too many choices. He sings in the voices of his many heroes but rarely his own. He cries his Freedom Song - \"for all the people in here who consider themselves free from isms and schisms\" - and it goes down a storm, but really Mushtaq needs to take it down the road to south London if he wants to make a difference."}, "isHosted": false}}}
