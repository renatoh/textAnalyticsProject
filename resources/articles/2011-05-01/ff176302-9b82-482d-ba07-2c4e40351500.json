They are now potentially 90 minutes away from achieving the improbable again when they visit Stoke City on Sunday. In a town famed for its rugby league tradition Wigan have the lowest gates and, Blackpool aside, the lowest budget at this level. Roberto Mart\u00ednez, the Wigan manager, is aware that relegation would force him to cut the wage bill and sell key players such as Charles N'Zogbia and Hugo Rodallega. But you will not see the Spaniard ranting and raving whatever happens, and he claims his side have adopted a fearless approach for the run-in, which was evident during last Sunday's dramatic 3-2 win over West Ham United. \"We've had no fear and nothing to lose in the last two games. It's been an opportunity more than fear,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"When you are relegated you have to be drastic with your decisions. But the focus in the dressing room has been clear \u2013 we've won the first final and need to do the same in the second. \"We have nothing to lose. We have been in this situation since the end of November. And everyone expected Wigan to be the first team relegated and we've been working hard to stay at this level.\" Wigan are level on points with Birmingham City, who travel to Tottenham Hotspur, and Blackpool, who visit Manchester United, so the Lancashire club could lose in the Potteries yet survive on goal difference. Mart\u00ednez does not subscribe, though, to the theory that Wigan have the best hand of their relegation rivals when they face a mid-table Stoke side who are still reeling from their FA Cup final defeat by Manchester City. \"I can understand from the outside people saying that, but you need to know Stoke City. And you need to know Tony Pulis,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"If you are asking me if I would rather be in Blackburn's position or ours, I would rather be in theirs.\" Rovers have one point more than the Latics and are level with Wolverhampton Wanderers, their hosts on Sunday. If Wigan needed an extra motivation to beat the drop, then they would aid the recovery of a stricken supporter, George Owen. The pensioner suffered a heart attack towards the end of the win over West Ham, and paramedics were on the scene at the DW Stadium, to resuscitate the 83-year-old and take him to hospital. \"That's how much it feels individually and collectively for the town,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"In our lives nothing gets your emotion and passions touched like football does and that's a responsibility we've got for the town.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
