After taking two finals to Edinburgh and last year's to Twickenham, the Rugby Football League has turned to Cardiff as a big-match venue. \"Since the closure of Wembley the Millennium Stadium has been recognised by many sports as being the ideal stage for prestigious events, and rugby league is no different,\" said the RFL's new executive chairman Richard Lewis. The RFL can also bank on far greater local support in Wales than in Scotland. Even in the disastrous 2000 World Cup almost 18,000 saw Wales's game against New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium. Meanwhile Carney's hopes of becoming the fifth Irishman to play in a Challenge Cup final remain up in the air. The former Gaelic footballer has been consistently impressive for Wigan, giving a solid display in the semi-final against Castleford and scoring two tries against Warrington last Friday. But Wigan's coach Stuart Raper has recalled Jamie Ainscough and Paul Johnson, who missed the semi-final with illness and injury respectively, to his three-quarters, leaving Carney as one of six contenders for the four substitutes' places. Raper has included Kris Radlinski even though the full-back is still in hospital recovering from a blood infection. But the England prop Harvey Howard is out with flu. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
