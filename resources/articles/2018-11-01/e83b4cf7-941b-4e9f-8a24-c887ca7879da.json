He is now 18 and a grade-three mechanic. Beyond that, he is funny, generous, gentle and good-looking, and he ought to have it made. But his mum threw him out earlier this year (\u201cDecided her boyfriend was better than I am, basically\u201d), blocked him on her phone and told the council, when they went round to plead for her to take her son back in, that there was no chance of him returning. So, he went to Blackpool to look for work. He found work \u2013 a zero-hours contract at a fast-food place \u2013 but he also found himself part of the hidden homeless. What began as sofa surfing gradually gave way to shelters and nights on the street. His boss offers to pay for a B&amp;B when his shifts finish too late for him to get a shelter (you have to be there by 7pm to have a chance of a place), but he refuses to take her up on it. And \u2013 because there are girls who will have to stay on the streets if he takes up a bed (there are just eight in the Streetlife shelter, the only one in town that specifically supports young homeless people) \u2013 he stays out instead. He is one of the tens upon tens of thousands \u2013 think of that, tens upon tens of thousands \u2013 of 16-to-24-year-olds who experience some form of homelessness every year, and one of a handful followed for nine months by Stacey Dooley for The Young and Homeless (BBC One), a film made in conjunction with Children in Need. The other young people include Shelby and Cat, who left unhappy homes and the care system and ended up on the sofas of friends, then on the streets of Manchester. Cat lives in a tent under a railway arch and has already sunk deep within herself. Until recently, she had kept hold of her job \u2013 the resilience and determination of everyone Dooley speaks to makes you want to bang austerity politicians\u2019 heads off cobbles until they start shitting money \u2013 but now she just can\u2019t manage. \u201cI think,\u201d she says, amid piles of sleeping bags, crisp packets and crack pipes that have accumulated under the arches over the years, \u201cit makes you depressed a little bit. I get down. I don\u2019t want to get out of bed.\u201d Shelby\u2019s eyes look brighter, but perhaps this is just what perpetual vigilance looks like. She is sleeping alone on a sofa in someone\u2019s back garden and \u201cthere\u2019s quite a lot of crime going on these days\u201d, she says. \u201cGirls getting groomed and that. There\u2019s an art to it, apparently. They can twist your mind and just make it feel like it\u2019s your fault.\u201d Has she ever been approached by them, asks Dooley. \u201cNot recently,\u201d is the answer. \u201cI\u2019ve been through stuff before, so I\u2019m quite clever with stuff like that. I can spot it.\u201d Shelby made her first suicide attempt at 12. Dooley \u2013 an excellent presenter, anyway \u2013 is the natural and ideal choice here. Her interviewees need and deserve her supportive, warm presence, and she is close enough in age and attitude to tread where older reporters might hesitate to go. And viewers need her willingness between interviews to share her thoughts on screen. \u201cWhen I was 18,\u201d she remembers, \u201cI was working at Luton airport and spending all my money on going out and buying tops. I had no fears, no responsibilities \u2026 They\u2019re so streetwise,\u201d she says of her subjects. \u201cBut they also seem like babies.\u201d And they do. Neglected, struggling, impossibly brave, possibly doomed babies, older than we will ever be. There are some happy endings, within the limited parameters of their stories. Cat finds a hostel that provides support, and life comes back into her face. With the help of other charities, Josh surmounts the obstacles of being over 18 and without a connection to Blackpool to become a priority case for the council, and manages to get a private rental flat. He will be on housing benefit at first, but he has two jobs and is sure \u2013 and please, God, let this be the voice of his hard-won experience and not his beautiful, dangerous, youthful optimism \u2013 he will soon be able to pay the rent himself and start to build a life. There\u2019s no definitive word on Shelby. A law was passed in April requiring councils to make housing all young people without homes a priority. Centrepoint estimates they need an extra \u00a310m to be able to do such a thing. I guess Shelby \u2013 and tens upon tens of thousands of her fellow sufferers \u2013 are still waiting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
