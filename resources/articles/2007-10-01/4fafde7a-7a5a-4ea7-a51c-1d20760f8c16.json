It will be necessary for you to consider whether, if each officer had done his or her duty, had done what we say was eminently and reasonably practicable for them to do, Jean Charles might still be alive. \"We say that the police planned and carried out an operation that day so badly that the public were needlessly put at risk, and Jean Charles de Menezes was actually killed as a result ... We say that it was the police operation itself which invited the disaster. The disaster was not the result of a fast-moving operation going suddenly and unpredictably awry. It was the result of fundamental failures to carry out a planned operation in a safe and reasonable way. \"Commander John McDowell's strategy required that armed officers should be present to carry out the stops [outside the south London home of De Menezes] ... Although the building was very rapidly put under surveillance, inexplicably, by the time Jean Charles emerged from his flat just after 9.30am that morning, no one had even completed that assessment let alone got round to placing specialist firearms officers in the area. \"That is over four hours after the strategy was set, four hours at a time when ... there was supposed to be 24-hour firearms cover to protect Londoners, four hours when there was nothing that could be done to stop a suicide bomber coming out of Scotia Road other than to expect the surveillance officers who were there to do their best ... \"The evidence you will hear will show that there was fundamental confusion about what the operation involved and what the police were supposed to be doing ... If he had been a suicide bomber emerging with a backpack and a murderous intent, no one had any established plan that could have dealt with him because the firearms officers had not arrived and the surveillance officers were only lightly armed at best. \"Some were not armed at all. We say there was no good reason for this state of affairs. Nothing the firearms officers did between 4.55am and 9.30am, which included getting their weapons and being briefed, driving across London, even filling up with petrol, appears to have justified leaving the address of a suicide bomber watched only by lightly armed surveillance officers ... \"The operation that led to Jean Charles's death should have been planned, controlled and supervised by a group of senior officers at New Scotland Yard. That was the theory. The reality was different. Officers from other departments - many of whom had no real business being there - crowded into the room to see what was going on. \"The operations room was noisy and chaotic. The officers who were involved in the operation had to shout to make themselves heard. The officer supposed to monitor the surveillance commentary had great difficulty in hearing the radio transmissions of the surveillance officers. There were repeated requests for non-essential staff to leave the room. \"Whether this atmosphere contributed to the disaster that occurred no one can say for sure but it cannot have helped the decision-making process and it cannot have assisted analysing the information that was coming in from the officers watching Jean Charles. \"While the surveillance officers did not hear anything over the radio which could have led anyone to believe that Jean Charles had been identified as the suspect or that he had been safely discounted, in the operations room some officers apparently thought that there had been first a positive non-identification and then later a positive identification ... Neither of these extreme views were justified on what the surveillance team were seeing and transmitting. There is no doubt the control room were looking for certainty - they did not appear to have a strategy to cope when this was absent. The police's failures meant members of the public were in fact put at risk in two ways. \"Firstly, because the police had allowed a suspected suicide bomber to travel on a packed bus and in due course to enter a busy tube train without doing anything to reduce that risk. Indeed by their actions they had actually increased the risk. They had let Jean Charles board a bus. While on the bus if he had been a suicide bomber he may well have been aware of a police interest in him. \"The police had also let Jean Charles get on a tube train. Once on, it would have been obvious to Jean Charles, if he had been a suicide bomber, that armed police were coming towards him. \"You will hear how obvious the approach of the firearms officers was and that the surveillance officers pointed at Jean Charles and shouted 'he is here'. \"If Jean Charles had been a bomber, any bomb would have been detonated well before the firearms officers entered his carriage. The fact is that London and, in particular, the occupants of that tube carriage were lucky Jean Charles was not a bomber, but that is no defence which can aid the commissioner, because as I have said it is the exposure to danger that is important. \"Secondly, members of the public were also put at risk because the failure to stop Jean Charles in a controlled and considered manner above ground made it far more likely - perhaps even inevitable - that he would be shot when he was stopped underground. \"In that environment it was far more likely the police would decide that shooting him was the only safe way to detain him. And when the time came to stop him deep in the underground station it was a matter of luck that others were not killed or injured. \"As the armed officers entered the train Jean Charles stood up. He was grabbed by a surveillance officer, 'Ivor', and pushed back in his seat. Two firearms officers, who I will refer to as C2 and C12, leaned over 'Ivor' and placed their Glock 9mm pistols against Jean Charles's head and fired. \"He was shot seven times in the head and died immediately.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
