Nathaniel Gleicher, who runs the company\u2019s response to politically motivated malfeasance on its platform, said groups such as Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency (IRA) were increasingly trying to manipulate public perception of themselves. \u201cNot running a large network of fake accounts but just playing on the fact that everyone thinks there are large networks of fake accounts out there,\u201d he said. While the St Petersburg-based IRA\u2019s previous tactics required hiding its involvement in debate so as to avoid detection, instead the group will noisily announce its participation in public discourse so as to cast doubt on the authenticity of every other social media user at the same time. \u201cThe best example we saw of this was in the direct lead-up to the US midterms in 2018 when, on the eve of the vote, an actor linked to the IRA, claiming to be the IRA, put up a website that said: \u2018We control public debate in the US and we\u2019ve decided who\u2019s going to win and who\u2019s going to lose,\u2019 and they posted about 100 Instagram accounts as evidence of the tens of thousands of accounts that they had. They were trying to play on everyone\u2019s fears,\u201d Gleicher said. He said that effort had been thwarted because the US government had found the accounts a few days earlier and warned Facebook to remove them, and because the state, industry and civil society had all independently said they had not seen any large-scale manipulation in the weeks leading up to the election. \u201cBut this technique, of preying on everyone\u2019s fears, we expect to see a lot more of. And quite frankly it\u2019s an interestingly challenging problem to deal with because they\u2019re forcing you to prove a negative. They\u2019re forcing all of us to prove a negative. Prove that there wasn\u2019t manipulation. Which is incredibly challenging.\u201d Other spheres of discourse have already taken a hit. In February, BuzzFeed News reported on the trouble that some American black activists were having in trying to convince online interlocutors that they were not fake accounts. \u201cEverybody is a bot now and no one can have a real conversation,\u201d Shireen Mitchell, the founder of Stop Online Violence Against Women, told the website. \u201cThere are real black people criticising these [Democratic presidential] candidates rightfully, but there are also fake accounts out there just looking to take advantage of any tension they can find in the community.\u201d Gleicher was speaking at the 360/OS conference in London, a meeting of the world\u2019s \u201copen-source intelligence\u201d community including groups such as Bellingcat and Forensic Architecture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
