All that went wrong for Armstrong as he rode to the 14th Tour stage win of his career was that he was unable to offer the victory on the Plateau de Beille to his team-mate Roberto Heras. Having set up his leader's winning attack four miles from this sunbaked mountain top, in the same emphatic style in which he had launched Armstrong's stage win when the race entered the Pyrenees on Thursday, Heras sprang away from the only other rider still in contention, his fellow Spaniard Joseba Beloki, and for a few minutes, as he rode through the corridor of fans waving Basque flags, it seemed as if he might catch up with his boss. Armstrong did not exactly slow down, but he looked back repeatedly before it became clear that Heras was not going fast enough, and so on he went, spinning his legs with the rapid cadence which the French press have nicknamed \"the coffee grinder\". Yesterday, everyone was again grist to his mill. The episode merely underlines Armstrong's dominance in the mountains, which is now of the kind that the Tour has not seen since the days of Eddy Merckx, 30 years ago. But even Merckx was not able to win the first two mountain stages of the Tour two years running, which the Texan cancer survivor has now done. Currently, there are no climbers capable of living with him, except perhaps Heras, and Armstrong took the wise precaution of hiring him at the end of 2000. Armstrong is at pains to point out that there are nine days to come. \"It takes one bad day in the mountains and you can lose everything. If you have a bad day on the Ventoux, for example, when it's very steep and hot, you can lose a lot of time.\" The Ventoux is tackled tomorrow, but it is hard to see Beloki, who is now 2min 28sec behind, achieving much without the intervention of fate. While Armstrong bided his time until the final climb to the Plateau, the rest of yesterday's six-hour run over a series of little mountain passes in the rustic glory of the Ari\u00e8ge was taken up with Laurent Jalabert and Richard Virenque's battle for the hearts and minds of the French public. Thus far, it has been one-way traffic. Until Jalabert's surprise announcement on Tuesday that this will be his last Tour, roadside preferences - to judge from the signs waved by the public - were divided. Jalabert's imminent departure has struck a sentimental chord, however, and the verges of the Tour's route have been a forest of placards with one message variously expressed: Don't go, Laurent. His 75-mile lone escape in Thursday's first mountain stage whipped up the affection still further. Virenque, who is not showing anything like the form which won him five King of the Mountains jerseys, responded yesterday, but Jalabert also had his plans for the stage. The pair both escaped early in yesterday's stage, but it was \"Jaja\" who ended up in front. His plan was to lead over the four mountains before the finish and take the measled vest which Virenque has always seen as his personal property. \"Jaja en pois\" as one placard put it: \"Jalabert in peas\", a reference to the maillot \u00e0 pois, as the red-spotted climber's jersey is known. So Jalabert raced away on the first hill, the Col de Mente, with the Swiss Laurent Dufaux and the Spaniard Isidro Nozal, and Virenque was left chasing impotently behind for much of the stage. On the climb to the finish, Armstrong and company swept past like a TGV passing a local train, but Jaja is now in peas. In fact, full of beans would be more like it. This was a day of blinding heat amid the scent of mountain hay and the hillsides covered in bracken. The fans ripped branches off roadside trees to create impromptu sun shelters but \"the Panda\", as Jalabert is known, remained impassive behind his mirror sunglasses, his white racing cap pulled tightly down over his forehead. Behind, the riders made constant visits to their team support cars for drinks and they grabbed bottles off the spectators. If the heat continues this weekend, there could be many casualties. The air in these valleys is supposed to have stress-reducing properties, but that did not stop a rare episode of two-wheeled road rage when France's Christophe Moreau and Jalabert's Spanish team-mate Carlos Sastre came to blows after bumping into each other in the bunch and spent the next few seconds swapping pushes and punches. If they avoided falling off, it said more about their cycling skill than their sang-froid. This was mere playground stuff compared with the day's killer punch, delivered by Armstrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
