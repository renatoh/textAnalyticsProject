In a scathing report, Ann Abraham said the department had forced the family to relive their ordeal time and again, while stubbornly refusing to pay them thousands of pounds in compensation. Abraham said she had ordered the MoD to pay the money and demanded ministers apologise \u2013 recommendations that have both been accepted. She said the case was \"the worst example I have seen in nearly nine years \u2026 of a government department getting things wrong and then repeatedly failing to put things right or learn from its mistakes\". The episode centres on compensation offered to Britons who were interned by the Japanese in Singapore. In 2000, the government set up an \"ex-gratia\" scheme to provide payments to internees who had survived imprisonment by the Japanese. This was intended to recognise the \"debt of honour\" for the treatment meted out to them because they were British. One man, known as Mr A, and his siblings, applied to the scheme, but were refused payment because they failed a so-called \"blood-link\" test \u2013 essentially, they were not deemed British enough. Mr A was born in British Malaya. The family, who wanted to remain anonymous, fought the decision and received \u00a3500 and an apology. In 2007, the MoD set up a second \"injury to feelings\" scheme, designed to compensate families left out of the first one. Despite being invited to apply by the MoD, Mr A's family was turned down again. They were also told that the \"previous apology and payment had been given to them in error\". Abraham described the MoD's behaviour as \"disgraceful and unfair\". The family challenged the decision and, though Mr A has since died, his wife and his siblings will now receive the compensation he fought for. In her report, Abraham describes how Mr A was captured and taken to the Sime Road internment camp in Singapore on 25 March 1945. He was eight years old. His future wife was also a child prisoner at the camp. They were liberated on 6 September 1945. During the six months of imprisonment, Mr A was separated from his parents and older brothers. He suffered from scabies and was forced to stand naked in the sun before getting treated by doctors. \"Mr A said that the protracted dealings with the MoD caused him and his siblings to relive their traumatic experiences in the internment camp. He described this as 'not just mental anguish, but torture',\" the ombudsman's report says. Abraham said the MoD had aggravated Mr A's distress in the last years of his life, and she described the retraction of the first apology as \"offensive and incorrect\". \"Those failings are unacceptable in any context,\" said Abraham. \"In the context of a compensation scheme intended to recognise the unique circumstances and exceptional suffering of British people held captive in the far east during the second world war, they were unforgivable.\" Mr A's widow, who now lives in Australia, and 11 of his siblings, will each be paid \u00a34,000 compensation and a further \u00a35,000 each for the distress they have suffered. The MoD has also been forced to offer compensation to other people in this position. A spokesman said it had contacted three other individuals who have similar cases and another 13 who have already received a payment of \u00a3500 and may be entitled to the full amount. The minister for veterans, Andrew Robathan, admitted the ombudsman's report had highlighted \"significant failings by the Ministry of Defence in dealing with these and other similar cases\". He added: \"The payments to Mr A's family have already been made and my officials have identified a very small number of similar cases. \"While we cannot be answerable for the conduct of the previous government \u2026 I offer my sincere apologies for the distress, anger and frustration caused to this family throughout this long and painful period. I hope an injustice has now been fairly rectified.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
