Speaking via satellite at a privacy conference at New York\u2019s Bard College on Friday, Snowden said: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s claims are false here.\u201d \u201cThis is important, right?\u201d Snowden told an audience at the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College. \u201cTruth should matter in politics, and courage should matter in politics, because we need change. Everyone knows we need change. And we have been aggrieved and in many ways misled by political leaders in the past.\u201d Before Snowden spoke, Clinton repeated the claim on Friday, at a campaign appearance in New Hampshire. After a voter said Snowden was \u201cclose to a patriot,\u201d BuzzFeed reported, Clinton disagreed and said he could have received whistleblower protections but instead chose to break the law. \u201cHe broke the laws of the United States,\u201d Clinton said at the debate on Tuesday. \u201cHe could have been a whistleblower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that.\u201d Multiple passes at fact-checking Clinton\u2019s claim this week have concluded that \u201cthe protections of being a whistleblower\u201d do not exist in the real world and did not apply to Snowden. A 1989 whistleblower law, for example, does not apply to intelligence community employees. A separate law for would-be intelligence whistleblowers has been deemed a trap because it has led not to protections but to prosecutions. \u201cThere is, I think, in many ways a lack of political courage in the established class that we expect to champion [our rights],\u201d Snowden said at Bard, to enthusiastic applause. The second US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled in May that the dragnet phone metadata collection program exposed by Snowden was indeed illegal. In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session that lasted the better part of two hours, Snowden also rejected the premise of a question at the debate as to whether he was a hero or traitor. He discussed his Twitter habits, criticized Facebook for taking the side of the government over the side of users, and he praised the unidentified whistleblower who provided documents relating to drone warfare published on Thursday in an expos\u00e9 by The Intercept. \u201cThanks to some extraordinary whistleblower who provided this information to the Intercept, we now know that these drone attacks that claimed the lives of innocents, 90% of the time, nine out of 10 of those killed are not the intended targets,\u201d Snowden said. He dismissed the hero-or-traitor question, which CNN host Anderson Cooper posed at the presidential debate. \u201cI reject both [labels],\u201d Snowden said. \u201cBecause even though people say being a hero would be a good thing, it\u2019s other-izing, it\u2019s distancing, it\u2019s, \u2018This person did something I could never do in that situation\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s absolutely not true.\u201d Asked about being a privacy advocate who has nonetheless become active on Twitter, Snowden said he uses Tor and other \u201cprivacy-enhancing technologies\u201d to protect his personal information when he uses social media. He did not appear to be a Facebook user. \u201cThey\u2019re really unwilling to make a commitment to the user,\u201d Snowden said of the site. \u201cThey really need to decide who they work for \u2013 the government, or the people who use their services.\u201d Asked whether he was willing to face charges for leaking classified material, Snowden said that the law under which he has been charged, the Espionage Act of 1917, would not allow him to make the case that he had acted in the public good. Snowden said he had been in contact with the government \u2013 apparently not recently \u2013 about how some kind of plea deal would work. \u201cThey said \u2018Well, we won\u2019t torture you\u2019,\u201d Snowden said. \u201c\u2018But we haven\u2019t got beyond that.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
