You can't check in anywhere these days without wrestling with it. Take the newly-reopened Sandy Lane in Barbados. Looking around a one-bedroom suite is like going to Nasa. There's a huge metre-wide plasma TV at the end of the bed and another before the chintz sofa. And eight remote controls, each with eight buttons, dotted around the suite in mahogany frames to open the curtains/nets/patio doors/dim lights etc etc. That's 64 buttons to work out in a few square feet. For customers returning to Sandy Lane for the first time in four years (the time the hotel has been shut for refurbishment) the introduction of all this techno stuff is a bit of a shock. Barbara Catchpole, of Elegant Resorts, says some of her customers just haven't been able to cope with it. One elderly couple, who had been regulars, checked out of Sandy Lane after a couple of days demanding a full refund because they found it all so confusing. They're not the only ones. As I found myself playing with the remote control at Sandy Lane so that I could operate a patio door to get out onto the beach, I couldn't help thinking how much quicker, simpler and more pleasant it would be to yank it open manually. For god's sake, who invented electronic locking patio doors? Do they think that their customers are disabled? A quick poll around our office finds we all hate electronic buttons on holiday. Many a time have I gone to bed with extra blankets in a tropical country because the air conditioning is whistling strong and I cannot work the digital switch to turn it down. My colleague Joanne recently spent a sleepless night in a hotel in Turin with the external sun blind banging against the window. Despite numerous attempts, she was unable to open the window to get to the blind to raise it. However many bits of string she pulled and tugged the blind refused to move. The next morning at breakfast, the blinds were the talk of the travel conference until one bright spark pointed out that a switch that may have looked like a light switch was the thing that operated the bothersome blinds. Showers are the other annoyance. At Villa Nova in Barbados, things were pretty simple (compared with Sandy Lane), but even still I managed to spray the entire bathroom by turning the wrong tap (i.e. the side handheld cleaning shower head rather than the one above). Now all you designers out there will smirk at the following uncool suggestion, but what about labelling the switches clearly? And how about making 'techno-free' a big selling point in the same way as some hotels such as Cobbler's Cove in Barbados make the fact they don't have a single TV a bonus. Wouldn't you rather wake up to the sound of the ocean gently lapping outside your window, than the boom of CNN on the plasma TV screen at the end of your bed? Holidays are supposed to be holidays. We don't want to have to go on an IT course to switch a light off, turn on a tap, or work the TV/curtains or patio doors. And yes, we all know you can ring room service for help, but there are only so many times you can do that before feeling a complete loser and getting stressed.
