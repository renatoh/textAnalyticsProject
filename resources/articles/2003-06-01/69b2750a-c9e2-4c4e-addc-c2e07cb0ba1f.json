It had been hoped that connections of Kris Kin would pay the \u00a366,000 supplementary fee for the English Derby winner and set up a clash with the unbeaten Dalakhani, who won the French Derby in such brilliant style and has been made 4-6 favourite for Sunday by Cashmans, who have Alamshar 3-1 second favourite. However, the ground in Ireland is riding on the fast side and, with a dry week forecast, it was considered that it would be too quick for Kris Kin. Joe Mercer, racing manager to the colt's owner Saeed Suhail, said: \"The ground is very firm out there and we decided we'll leave it. The horse is fine - we would just prefer a bit of cut in the ground for him.\" The Great Gatsby, who separated Kris Kin and Alamshar at Epsom, has been rated a 9-2 chance to go one place better on Sunday. The colt is one of six Aidan O'Brien-trained contenders, which include Brian Boru, Handel, High Country, Powerscourt and Roosevelt. John Oxx, who trains Alamshar, also has Alisar and Rayshan still in the race with the first-named expected to take up pacemaking duties, while Jim Bolger's Napper Tandy completes the 11 who stood their ground yesterday. The other \"Classic\" this weekend is the Pitmen's Derby - officially titled the Northumberland Plate - at Newcastle on Saturday, and it has seen an ante-post gamble on the Martin Pipe-trained Don Fernando. The champion jumps trainer is seeking his third victory in the two-mile handicap having won it previously with Tamarpour (1991) and Far Cry (1999). A maiden winner on the Flat when with Sean Woods, Don Fernando blossomed into a leading juvenile hurdler with Pipe and won a Grade Two event at Cheltenham in December. He finished seventh in the Ascot Stakes last week, beaten just five lengths by his stablemate Sindapour, and Ladbrokes have trimmed him to 8-1 from 16-1. Big Moment is fancied to follow up Amanda Perrett's success with Bangalore last year and is 7-1 from 8-1. \u00b7 Great Leighs is set to become the first new racecourse in Britain since Taunton in 1927. The Essex venue has been given the go-ahead by the British Horseracing Board, subject to being granted a licence by the Jockey Club, which is expected to be a formality following completion of the project."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
