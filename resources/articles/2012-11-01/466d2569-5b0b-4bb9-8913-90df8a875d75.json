They are almost always with you. The spontaneous nature of shooting with a phone often makes up for the lack of absolute creative control. And everyone's raising their game. Smartphones are gaining more camera functions, and cameras are gaining more phone functions \u2013 but the iPhone is still the daddy. Even though the Nokia 808 PureView offers arguably better image quality, and the Samsung Galaxy S3 offers faster shooting, neither are supported by the same ecosystem of apps or ancillary hardware from third-party vendors \u2026 \u2022 Get close, and then get closer. One of the major obstacles to overcome when shooting with a mobile phone is the lack of lens choice, but you can always use your feet to approach or retreat from your subject. \u2022 Depth effects must be forced. To give a perception of distance, try placing your subject very close to the lens and having some sort of background. \u2022 Focusing is nowhere near as rapid with a mobile phone camera. You need to anticipate the action. In some ways this actually takes more skill than using a digital SLR, but that is part of its appeal to me. \u2022 Phones are great for candid shooting. They're unobtrusive and they allow you to wander around almost unnoticed. \u2022 Expand your capabilities with accessories. Several companies are now offering ancillary lenses for smartphones. At the top end, there's the iPro lens system from Schneider Optics, which includes fish-eye, wide-angle and telephoto iPhone lenses. Diff also produces a range of twist-off lenses to accompany its tripod-mountable Diffcase. And then there's the wonderful Gizmon case, which transforms your iPhone into a retro rangefinder camera. Vtec's 12x telephoto lens is available for the Samsung Galaxy S II and iPhone. \u2022 Explore the apps. There are plenty of options allowing you to stitch together panoramas from a series of shots or create collages and audio slideshows. Then there are those that allow the camera to be fired remotely \u2013 or even triggered when sound reaches a certain level."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
