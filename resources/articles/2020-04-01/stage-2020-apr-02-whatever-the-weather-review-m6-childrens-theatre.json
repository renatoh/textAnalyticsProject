Weather or No played as a curtain-raiser to The Mikado at the Savoy. According to the Musical Times, the \u201cfunny little couple fall in love\u201d in a trifle of a show that would be \u201cwelcome to those who require pieces suitable for private theatricals\u201d. Whatever the Weather, created for children aged three to seven by Rochdale\u2019s touring theatre company M6, has a similar storyline. It is available to stream throughout April while theatres remain closed because of the coronavirus. Six-year-old Hilda and I are getting used to watching our own \u201cprivate theatricals\u201d at home during the shutdown. On the plus side: you can enjoy online theatre sprawled on the couch, noisily eating Twiglets and playing with the cat. On the downside? Hilda says she misses all the interaction or, as she puts it, \u201cthe \u2018Hello!\u2019 and the \u2018Welcome!\u2019\u201d She loves this show\u2019s set, which has a toadstool, a Bambi-alike deer and is populated with cutout Christmas trees that look like iced biscuits. Joss Matzen\u2019s attractively designed chalet looks smart on screen, with its clean lines defined by pitch-black surrounds. Carl Cockram\u2019s Mr Rain and Simone Lewis\u2019s Mrs Sunshine take turns to leave their shared home and, apart from the briefest of encounters, are always alone. She delights in the garden, playing keepy-uppy with a floating feather; he plonks about catching raindrops in his hands. \u201cThey each have a time to be funny,\u201d laughs Hilda. There is hardly any dialogue and we\u2019re soon chatting much more than we would in a theatre. This makes a nice change: kids\u2019 minds race so quickly that they are often on to the next thing by the time you\u2019ve left the theatre and don\u2019t dwell on discussing the performance. When the couple start to look after a nest of birds (\u201cfluffy pompoms!\u201d cries Hilda), Gilly Baskeyfield\u2019s story and her jaunty production gently explore themes of family and shared responsibilities, which is useful at this lockdown time when we\u2019re all striving to get along in the same space. Mr Rain\u2019s drainpipe contraption, and his tricks with differently coloured water, may inspire some postshow activities at home and M6\u2019s website has its own downloadable resource pack and story book too. Whatever the Weather should help children see the world a little differently on their daily trip outside or recognise that every day comes with sunny and rainy feelings even if you stay indoors. There are no prizes for guessing what happens at the end, when Mr Rain and Mrs Sunshine stay outdoors together, but really the whole show is a rainbow, full of delightfully sweet magic. Available online until 30 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
