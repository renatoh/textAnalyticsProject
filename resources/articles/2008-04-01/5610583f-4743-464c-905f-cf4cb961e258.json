The leaves and the dressings that cling to them, the meals that revolve around its place in the centre of the table and the thought with which its contents are put together makes this simple white bowl a pivotal part of this cook's life. Right now, with spring in full flow, there are late chicories, their bases flushed with deep maroon and their bitterness tempered by honey-sweet dressings, micro leaves of cress, radish, and young kale tops the size of bird's-breast feathers with dressings so light as to be almost invisible. From the garden there are the first saw-edged dandelions poking through the cracks in the path, and from the ground itself ochre-stemmed chard, straggly land cress and flat-leaf parsley. If I were a more organised guy, there could be much more too. A little book came this week that will ensure I exploit every leafy possibility throughout the year. Salad Leaves for All Seasons (\u00a310.95, Green Books) is Charles Dowding's must-have for those besotted with young green leaves. He tells us how to grow lettuce in a window box and beetroot in a pot, and how to plant for leaves to harvest on the coldest days of the year. For the gardener there are planting plans and sowing instructions and hints to planting by the moon. As well as salads for allotments, window boxes and gardens, there is also much for the cook, which is why I mention it. Dowding's unpretentious little book includes a guide to the flavour of each and every salad leaf. The only letdown is that even a man who picks salad leaves 365 days a year still hasn't found the perfect slug deterrent. Anyone who has built a salad of more than one kind of leaf knows that the key to a good mixture is balance. Standing over the sink dipping the leaves into a bowl of ice-cold water, I taste as I go, making a mental note of how much of the assembled leafage is bitter or sweet or mild or a bit nothingy. The one-note hit of smooth butterhead lettuce, stridently bitter rocket or sharp-as-jagged-glass sorrel leaves is better in small quantities. A whole plate of chicory can be tongue-numbing after five minutes' chomping. An entire bowl of soft-leaf lettuce is more than likely to send you to sleep. This is why I tend to mix and match, and occasionally mix and mismatch. I grow my leaves in anything that will hold a litre or two of compost. Shallow wooden seed trays are good for micro leaves, clay pots for large lettuces such as cos, and the rest goes into recycled black plastic pots. Space is limited, so the garden steps and the basement find themselves home to an assortment of green and pink blushed leaves. I have just planted the first of the spring salad leaves. Jacob's Coat chard, with its pretty pink, ruby and orange stems to give the salads an earthy edge; for heat and spice I have scattered wild rocket seed into large pots; giant red mustard (which is usually green in my cold frame) and Green in the Snow for its shocking hot pungency. Also going in in the next week or two is maroon-freckled romaine lettuce and the crunchy little cos Reine de Glace for fresh, mild-green bulk. Other seedlings are picked young to add interest - blood-red beetroot leaves, curly pea shoots and young radish sprouts. I have no true garden space for salads. Even if I had a suitable salad patch with light, slightly gravelly soil and a bit of shade, the snails would finish them off faster than you can say garlic butter. I grow many of my lettuces in pots; they provide a place safe from predators and give them at least a chance to survive. Until I can get the dressing made, at least. A salad of leaves, herbs, pancetta and croutons A perfect and classic salad, with a mixture of cool and hot leaves, crisply grilled bacon and hot croutons. Serves 2. 200g piece of pancetta or smoked bacon 2 thick slices of good bread, crusts removed a little light olive oil or groundnut oil For the salad: 4 handfuls of mixed salad leaves: rocket, mustard greens, claytonia, little gem, sorrel, etc a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley 6 bushy sprigs of tarragon about 20 basil leaves for the dressing: 1 tbsp tarragon vinegar 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 1 tbsp yogurt a dab of French mustard Cut the pancetta into small dice and the bread into larger pieces. Cook the pancetta in a shallow pan with a little oil until the fat is golden, then lift it out and drain it on kitchen paper. Using both the fat remaining in the pan and a little more oil if need be, cook the bread cubes till they are golden on all sides. (Watch them carefully: they can burn quite easily.) Put them on kitchen paper to drain. Rinse the salad carefully, so as not to damage any of the fragile leaves. (They are best dried in a salad spinner.) Pull all the leaves from the herb branches, tear the basil roughly and chop the others. Mix the vinegar and olive oil together with the yogurt and mustard and a little salt and black pepper. Taste for seasoning. Toss the salad leaves with the dressing, divide between two large plates, then scatter over the hot pancetta and croutons. Eat right away, while the bacon is still hot and the croutons are still crisp. Spring leaves and melted cheese Serves 2 as a main-course salad 12 tips of sprouting broccoli or spears of asparagus 4 large handfuls of baby spinach 3 large handfuls of young, spicy salad leaves a bunch of watercress 2 slices from a sourdough loaf 80g soft, easily melting cheese such as Fontina For the dressing: 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 1\u00bd tbsp walnut oil 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil Trim the asparagus or broccoli then cut it into short pieces. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, salt it, then cook the asparagus for 5 or 6 minutes, the broccoli for 4, till tender. To make the dressing, dissolve a pinch of sea salt in the vinegar then mix in the olive and walnut oils with a little ground pepper. Drain the asparagus or broccoli and let it sit in the dressing. Set aside. Wash the salad leaves and watercress and drain them thoroughly. Toast the slices of bread lightly on both sides. Slice the cheese and spread it between the two pieces of bread, then toast them until the cheese melts. Cut each piece of toast diagonally into 4 or 5 short strips. Toss the leaves with the asparagus or broccoli and the dressing and divide between two large plates or shallow bowls. Place the toasted cheese on top of the salads and serve. nigel.slater@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
