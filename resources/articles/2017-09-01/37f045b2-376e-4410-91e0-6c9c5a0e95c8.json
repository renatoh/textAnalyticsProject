The felony assault charges against four Alameda County deputies, accused of victimizing eight prisoners, have provided a window into the violent abuse and misconduct that prisoners\u2019 rights activists say is still commonplace in some jails across the country, including in progressive regions that have pledged reforms. Deputies Justin Linn and Erik McDermott are facing charges of assault, witness intimidation and conspiracy to obstruct justice for their actions at Santa Rita jail, a major county correctional facility for parts of the San Francisco Bay Area in northern California, including the city of Oakland. One victim woke up one morning in November to an inmate throwing urine on him after Linn opened a cell door to facilitate the attack, according to the charges. When the victim pressed an emergency call button to seek aid, \u201cLinn responded to his cell and laughed at him when he made the report,\u201d prosecutors wrote. The inmate who threw the urine said that Linn had opened the cell door so that the inmate could \u201cgas\u201d another inmate, meaning throwing bodily fluids, according to prosecutors. The inmate who committed the assault said he did not hit the \u201cintended target\u201d, who was a different prisoner with a broken arm. Another victim said he was sprayed with feces from a shampoo bottle through his cell\u2019s handcuffing port, which should have been closed. Another jail employee also testified to witnessing Lynn facilitate urine and feces attacks, prosecutors said. McDermott, also accused of opening handcuffing ports to allow an inmate to \u201cgas\u201d others, is further alleged to have strangled an inmate by \u201cplacing pressure around his neck with his arm until he lost consciousness\u201d. Linn and McDermott both intimidated witnesses into staying silent, including by trying to spread rumors that victims and witnesses were \u201csnitches\u201d who were cooperating with law enforcement, prosecutors alleged. Deputies Sarah Krause and Stephen Sarcos, also facing assault charges, were accused of playing an active role in another gassing assault. An inmate told investigators that he threw his feces at a victim in an attack \u201cplanned with the help of \u2026 Krause and Sarcos\u201d, the charges said. The two admitted in interviews that they \u201cfacilitated the assault\u201d by opening a cell door, according to prosecutors with the Alameda County district attorney\u2019s office. The charges were based on an investigation of more than 40 people, including other sheriff\u2019s employees and inmates, and all four deputies have been arrested, prosecutors said. \u201cThese four deputies directed, facilitated, enabled and committed sadistic and terrorizing acts against several men whose protection fell directly within the responsibility of their positions as correctional officers,\u201d the district attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe conduct of these four defendants violates the law and there is no rational explanation for their actions aside from abject cruelty and a disregard for the humanity of the inmates.\u201d Attorneys for the deputies could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. The sheriff\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. Tash Nguyen, a local organizer with the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, a California-based group that has pushed for jail reforms in Alameda County, said the charges reflected broader institutional flaws and the continuing mistreatment of inmates. \u201cIt\u2019s indicative of the culture of harm, carelessness, neglect and dehumanization,\u201d she said. \u201cDeputies pitting prisoners against each other is definitely not surprising to us.\u201d The Alameda County sheriff\u2019s office has also faced scrutiny over in-custody deaths, beatings of suspects and claims of inadequate jail healthcare. In San Francisco, a sheriff\u2019s deputy last year was accused of running an inmate \u201cfight club\u201d in which prisoners were forced to gamble for food and essentials and were told they could be beaten or shocked if they refused to beat each other. There have been similar reports of violent abuse and neglect across the US in recent years, including at jails and prisons in New York City, Oregon, Chicago and other facilities in California.
