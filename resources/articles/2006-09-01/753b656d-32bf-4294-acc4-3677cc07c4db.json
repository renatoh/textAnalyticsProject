The September 11 commemorations marked the centrepiece of ceremonies held across the US, including Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where Flight 93 crashed, and the Pentagon, where 184 people died. Hundreds of relatives and loved-ones bearing flowers streamed down the huge ramp that descends into the 16-acre (six-hectare) cavernous pit of Ground Zero to stand in silence as bells tolled at 8.46am, the moment in which Flight 11 struck the north tower. Further silences fell at 9.03am to mark the time Flight 175 hit the south tower, and 9.59am and 10.29am, when the two buildings collapsed. As a choir sang America the Beautiful, the flag that was raised on the evening of September 11 atop the debris was flown again, its cloth torn and colours faded. Then the names of all those who died were read out by their spouses and partners, most of whom were women, many wearing dark glasses to hide their distress. It took 10 minutes just to read the roll-call of those beginning with the letter A. A police officer, James Smith, recalled his wife, also an NYPD officer, who died: \"I've been thinking about what Moira would be doing today if she were here with us. She'd be still protecting the people of the city she loved, defending the nation she loved, keeping it from harm. And she would be raising the child she loved more than anything on Earth.\" George Bush was ubiquitous touring all three sites of the attacks for the first time since 2002. His day began at a New York firehouse in honour of the 343 fire fighters who died trying to save others. From there he travelled to Shanksville, where 40 passengers and crew were killed when their plane crashed into a field, and finally to the Pentagon. The day ended with a televised address from the Oval Office in which he called on Americans to stand firm despite the high human toll of what he called a \"struggle for civilisation\". Although many of the bereaved families had called for the commemorations to be free of politics, Mr Bush firmly linked the attacks to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In prepared remarks released by the White House in advance of last night's speech, he said: \"If we do not defeat these enemies now, we will leave our children to face a Middle East overrun by terrorist states and radical dictators armed with nuclear weapons.\" He said the wars were part of an epic struggle. \"We are fighting to maintain the way of life enjoyed by free nations. And we are fighting for the possibility that good and decent people across the Middle East can raise up societies based on freedom, and tolerance, and personal dignity.\" The address marked the culmination of presidential speeches designed to refocus Americans on the threat of terrorism and the administration's security record at a time when the Republican election push is faltering. Other officials picked up Mr Bush's theme. Under cool grey skies at the Pentagon, where part of the building was draped in a giant flag, Dick Cheney, the vice-president, and Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, said September 11 had awakened Americans to the threat extremists posed to their way of life. \"We have learned that there is a certain kind of enemy, whose ambitions have no limits and whose cruelty is only fed by the grief of others,\" Mr Cheney said. An opinion poll for Associated Press and Ipsos published yesterday found that more than 25% of Americans surveyed were worried about another terrorist attack, a proportion that rose to 50% for New Yorkers. Half said that since 9/11 they had changed their behaviour, becoming more cautious and suspicious of those around them. In London relatives of the 67 Britons who died on September 11 remembered their loved ones at a memorial garden close to the US embassy, as the anniversary was commemorated in dozens of other centres around the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
