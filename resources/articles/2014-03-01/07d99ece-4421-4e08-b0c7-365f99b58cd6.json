Arsenal remain on course for a remarkable 19th consecutive season among the European elite under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger although Everton and Tottenham Hotspur capitalised on their 6-0 humiliation at Stamford Bridge over the weekend. Spurs are only six points behind their north London rivals after beating Southampton on Sunday while Everton's win over Swansea City closed their gap on fourth place to eight points. Roberto Mart\u00ednez's team, who travel to Newcastle on Tuesday, have a game in hand on Arsenal and welcome the FA Cup semi-finalists to Goodison Park on Sunday week. \"They will be looking over their shoulder now,\" said McCarthy. \"Obviously they will be a bit worried but we take it a game at a time and we have a big game against Newcastle. We have never written ourselves off for a top-four finish. We will give it our best shot. We will keep playing until it is mathematically impossible. We have eight points between us and Arsenal and we have a game in hand, plus Arsenal to come here. It's still open and we will give it our best shot. We are still confident we can achieve something big here this season.\" Everton's defeat of Swansea was their eighth successive win at Goodison, the club's best sequence since 1986, and despite losing 4-1 to Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals McCarthy insists there is no chasm between the two sides. The Republic of Ireland international said: \"We have a few games before we play Arsenal but a lot of teams won't like coming here. The fans are brilliant and we have made Goodison a fortress this season so hopefully we can keep that up. \"We are playing in a good style and the fans are coming out in their numbers. Hopefully we kick on. \"We gave it our best shot in the league at Arsenal and we were disappointed not to take three points. We went there in the FA Cup and played our style and the penalty changed the game. We had a chance with Ross [Barkley] and if we took that we would have won the game, but wee things in football change the game. We will give it our best shot from now until the end of the season.\" Mart\u00ednez predicted last week one of the top four could collapse during the run-in and says he does not envisage Manchester City, Chelsea or Liverpool faltering. The Everton manager, who will make a late decision on whether to recall his captain, Phil Jagielka, from a hamstring injury against Newcastle, said: \"Manchester City's only focus is the league so you can't see a team with the squad they've got and the numbers they have in the league dropping their points' tally that much. Chelsea are in the driving seat and when you are in those positions you don't get long, adverse situations. Liverpool are the team in form and have got great momentum. \"The only one is Arsenal. They have had major, major injuries, the squad is reduced to the bare bones and they have a real focus on the FA Cup, a real opportunity to win a major trophy. \"So it is going to be a challenging end of the season.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
