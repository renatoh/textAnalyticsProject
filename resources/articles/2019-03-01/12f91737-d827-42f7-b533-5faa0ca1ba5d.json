The demonstration was organised by two powerful civil society groups, the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and \u00d2mnium Cultural, around the slogan: \u201cSelf-determination is not a crime. Democracy is about deciding.\u201d Hundreds of coaches were laid on to bring people to the capital from Catalonia and other parts of Spain. The organisers said 120,000 people attended, well beyond their expectations. Police however put the number of marchers at about 18,000. Police said the march passed off largely free of incident: a heavy security presence had been put in place to ensure that the event went ahead peacefully and that possible confrontations with far-right groups bitterly opposed to Catalan independence were avoided. Many members of Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence regional government attended the march, including the president, Quim Torra. Torra\u2019s predecessor, Carles Puigdemont, was not in Madrid. He was sacked by the Spanish government after organising the unilateral independence referendum in October 2017, and is living in self-imposed exile in Belgium after fleeing Spain to avoid arrest. Twelve of the pro-independence Catalan leaders who remained in Spain are currently on trial in Madrid over their alleged roles in the events that culminated in the staging of the referendum and the subsequent unilateral declaration of independence. Puigdemont offered his solidarity to two of them, Jordi S\u00e0nchez, a regional MP and former president of the ANC, and Jordi Cuixart, the leader of \u00d2mnium Cultural. \u201cThank you for your steadfastness and dignity, Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart,\u201d he tweeted earlier on Saturday. \u201cToday in Madrid there will be a representation of a people that progresses in peace and solidarity, which wants more and better democracy, and which demands its right to exist and to be respected. Today will be a memorable day!\u201d Nine of those on trial, who include former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras and former speaker of the Catalan parliament Carme Forcadell, are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years. Other charges include sedition and the misuse of public funds. Torra told reporters in Madrid that the march was needed in order to decry the trial, which he described as a farce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
