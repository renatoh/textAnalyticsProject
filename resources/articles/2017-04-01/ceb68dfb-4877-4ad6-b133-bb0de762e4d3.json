The match was delayed for 45 minutes after punches, projectiles and firecrackers were thrown at the Parc OL. Both teams were forced to leave the field as fans spilled on to the playing surface before kick-off, with Aulas, even going into the crowd in a desperate effort to calm tensions. Lyon went on to win their match 2-1 through two late goals from Corentin Tolisso and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Morel after the former Liverpool winger Ryan Babel had put Besiktas ahead. But Aulas admitted he was unsure whether the second leg - scheduled to take place in Istanbul on Thursday \u2013 would be played behind closed doors. \u201cI do not know what to do \u2013 to play behind closed doors or elsewhere,,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cBut it would be very dangerous for us to face this opponent with the same supporters as tonight. For now, we are not very reassured about how things can happen.\u201d There was also trouble outside the stadium, with a group of Besiktas supporters who had travelled from Germany reported to have smashed a pair of glass doors at the Lyon club shop after they were turned away for tickets. \u201cWe also saw that there were incidents before the match with the shop broken and damaged,\u201d added Aulas. \u201cWe can always say that the match organiser has to face these issues but either we make stadiums that make it possible to do family football or we build blockhouses with barbed wire. It is not football that you love.\u201d Aulas also suggested that the lack of fencing at the ground \u2013 which was opened ahead of Euro 2016 at the cost of around \u00a3350m \u2013 could have prevented more trouble. \u201cI heard some say, \u2018how can a pitch be invaded?\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, fortunately, if it could not be invaded, they would have been trapped by the Turkish supporters who came in force and some were without a ticket. It was a very difficult experience and I think it was up to me to take the responsibility of going to the South Tribune otherwise we would not have been able to play because our supporters were very angry with their Turkish counterparts.\u201d Bruno Genesio, the Lyon manager, admitted it was distressing to see such trouble. \u201cThis is the reverse of what should happen,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cWe are here to give pleasure to people and not to see that. You had to stay focused.\u201d In the other quarter-finals Ajax beat Schalke 2-0 in their home first leg while Celta Vigo edged ahead of Genk 3-2 at Bala\u00eddos."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
