This has been corrected. It doesn't take much to destroy a myth: just a bizarre object in an equally unlikely setting. Let's do that setting first. One of my favourite shops in all the world nestles under a sandstone arch in the small walled village of Ullastret, 20 miles from Girona in Spain. Basically, it's a butcher's. The meat grows fat in the fields at the back: from sty to sausage in two easy stages. But, since this is the only shop around, they do bread, veg and sundry staffs of rural life as well. Two lean, vibrant Catalan ladies chat, serve and slice. Local custom waits patiently while they do. How are your kids, and your grandchildren? Will they want butifarra for tea or pernil croquettes? You're welcome the moment you step inside. Here is the warm, pre-Tesco glow of long ago. So you choose croquettes for the kids this time; plus maybe ... a couple of steaks for supper? Se\u00f1ora Una disappears into the back and re-emerges, staggering under the weight of approximately half a cow. Say how thick you want her to cut them ... And then you notice something alien on the left-hand side of the counter (just over the tray of salt cod). It's a black tub with a sky blue border - and a sales pitch that no Catalan pig farmer could relate to. \"Convivial Yorkshire Crisps,\" the tub announces, adding bizarrely: \"chardonnay wine vinegar flavour.\" An irresistible encounter, much like finding a stray dog far from home and feeling duty-bound to nurture it. Where do you come from, little tub? \"From Wales Bar, between Sheffield and Rotherham\", the tub replies in tiny, dense type. \"It's not the pretty bit of Yorkshire - just the hard-working bit, 10 minutes away by tractor for good potato and parsnip land.\" And who filled you up, oh rotund receptacle? Why, \"Ashley Turner and Tony Bishop, who have worked together for 25 years (since Tony was Ashley's farm manager).\" Yon pair don't hold with any of the \"nasty stuff you normally find in mass-produced crisps\", apparently. This be totally natural produce \"for sharing between friends (as in 'convivial: adj. sociable; jovial or festive')\". Sit down with a pint of Yorkshire bitter then, lad, and enjoy the fruits of an enterprise Ash and Tone only started in January 2005. \"We're certainly the youngest and, with only four employees, probably the smallest crisp company in England,\" claims the tub, before spinning round to show off an extraneous picture of Whitby pier, suitably deserted on a cold, grey North Sea day and padded out with historical information about Oswy, King of Northumbria, building abbeys in AD657 (before crisps were invented). The tub, however, can offer no real clue as to how it managed to stray 1,400 miles from the village of Wales Bar into the depths of the Baix Empord\u00e0 (although a Spanish distributor called Delitas has something to do with it). Nor, more bafflingly, does it even attempt to justify its arty-farty, poncy-flouncy, sunflower-sodden attachment to chardonnay wine vinegar as a convivial ice breaker between consenting Catalan folk. My friend Dennis from Doncaster used to make his own elderflower wine, but he'd rather die than put chardonnay vinegar on his chips. He's the Yorkshire we know and love. A cricket fan for decades who can't be doing with this one-day-hit-and-hope tripe. A man's man who remembers Trueman steaming in at Headingley, who takes no nonsense. He belongs to the quasi-republic of legend that likes beef and onion gravy on its famous pudding and remembers the great times of Leeds United, when Norman Hunter broke legs before breakfast: flat caps, flat vowels, and a lip curl of contempt for soft southern indulgences. It was bad enough for his Yorkshire when Darren Gough won Strictly Come Dancing and then came back (from Essex!) to captain the county. But convivial crisps, with a website reference to \"Tracey and Gemma\" - the other two out of four employees - flogging their latest tomato, basil and mozzarella brand, and a plea for \"new and delicious suggestions\" for the coming crisp season? By gum! The globe's swung right off its bloody axis. What about porcini and sauvignon? Anyone for mango and swordfish? It's the end of Sheffield and Rotherham, and spud fields in between, as we knew them. It's Emmerdale turned into a ruddy apology for The Royal. I'm not sure how it would go at the Catalan restaurant I was last week (which served asparagus soup with prawns and All Bran on top). But it fared pretty well with the grandchildren (who scoffed a chardonnay tub at one secret sweep, then left their croquettes to feed the cat with). p.preston@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
