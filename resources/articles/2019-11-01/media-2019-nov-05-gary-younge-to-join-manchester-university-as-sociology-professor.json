He will leave his position as editor-at-large at the Guardian, which he joined in 1993, but continue to write for the organisation. Younge was appointed US correspondent in 2003 before taking up his current role in 2015. He previously reported from across Europe, Africa, the US and the Caribbean. \u201cThe Guardian was my first full-time job and I worked there for 26 years \u2013 it\u2019s been a fantastic experience,\u201d Younge said. \u201cJournalism, for me, has always been a process of inquiry and sharing whatever insights I\u2019ve gathered in an accessible and informative way \u2013 that\u2019s precisely what I hope to achieve as a professor at the University of Manchester, and why I\u2019m excited to be joining the sociology department. \u201cI won\u2019t be giving up journalism altogether. But teaching and researching at Manchester will provide a welcome shift of emphasis, even as I continue in that tradition.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, paid tribute to Younge and said she looked forward to him continuing to contribute to the Guardian. \u201cGary Younge is one of the leading thinkers and writers on politics and society working in Britain today,\u201d said Viner. \u201cHis powerful and distinctive reporting, commentary and film-making have been central to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of some of the biggest stories in the world for the last 20 years, and like many others at the Guardian, I\u2019ve learned a huge amount from working closely with Gary \u2013 about politics, about writing, about life. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry to see him leave, but I\u2019m delighted that he will continue to write for the Guardian \u2013 and that he will be continuing to use his talents to shine a light on some of society\u2019s most pressing problems.\u201d Prof Brian Heaphy, the head of the university\u2019s school of social sciences, said he was \u201ctruly delighted\u201d with Younge\u2019s appointment. \u201cHis work will be of enormous benefit to the school\u2019s students and research activities, and to the university\u2019s engagements beyond academia. As a journalist and author, Gary\u2019s work has long been grounded in principles of research that makes visible the social and political processes that shape people\u2019s everyday lives, often in very tragic circumstances.\u201d Younge, who lived in Hertfordshire before going to Sudan as a 17-year-old to teach English in a UN Eritrean refugee school, studied French and Russian at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and journalism at City University in London. He is an acclaimed author and has written five books: Another Day in the Death of America, A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives; The Speech \u2013 The Story Behind Martin Luther King\u2019s Dream; Who Are We \u2013 and Should it Matter in the 21st Century?; Stranger in a Strange Land \u2013 Travels in the Disunited States; and No Place Like Home \u2013 A Black Briton\u2019s Journey Through the Deep South."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
