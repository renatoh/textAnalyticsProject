You can read our full report here and see the main developments below: Five people died during an attack in Austria\u2019s capital on Monday night, two male and two female civilians, and one gunman who was killed by police. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said the victims were an older man, an older woman, a young passerby and a waitress. He described an injured police officer who tried to stop the attacker as brave. The army has been deployed in the capital to back up law enforcement, as a widespread search took place on Tuesday. Authorities described the attacker as a 20-year-old \u201cIslamist terrorist\u201d with North Macedonian and Austrian citizenship. Fourteen people, including at least one police officer, were injured by gun and knife attacks, which began at 8pm. Seven are in a critical condition. The assaults occurred at six locations close to Seitenstettengasse in the heart of the Austrian capital. Police said they were not certain how many attackers were on the streets and several people have been arrested. Authorities had earlier said at least one gunman was on the run. The interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said the assailant was \u201cheavily armed and dangerous\u201d and urged the public to stay indoors until the all-clear was given. Schools will be closed in Vienna on Tuesday and the country has declared three days of mourning. World leaders have expressed their solidarity with the Austrian people. We will be closing this blog soon. Before we do, here is a post from my colleague, Kate Connolly, who reports on theatre staff attempting to distract people trapped inside as the attack unfolded: Thousands of theatre and opera-goers caught up in last night\u2019s attack in Vienna spent hours stuck in auditoriums and foyers as police ordered a shut down during their hunt for the attackers. Across the city\u2019s cultural landscape, for which Vienna is famous, people who had been out enjoying the last performances ahead of a coronavirus lockdown, which started at midnight, reported being entertained by musicians who tried to divert their attention from the attack taking place outside. Many visitors to the Staatsoper, the Burgtheater, the Konzerthaus and other theatres and museums across Vienna, were not allowed to leave until given clear instructions by the police, and were obliged to leave the city centre. In the Konzerthaus, the percussionist Martin Grubinger played several encores in an attempt to prolong a performance in order to keep the unwitting concertgoers in their seats, Austrian TV reported. They were subsequently informed of the attacks and kept in the concert building, where they were provided with food and drink, until midnight. Parents whose children had been singing in the chorus at the Staatsoper were allowed to pick them up under police protection. Musicians of both the Staatsoper and the Konzerthaus orchestras kept stranded concertgoers entertained with impromptu performances, which were well documented on social media. Martin Kusej, the director of the Burgtheater, the equivalent of Austria\u2019s national theatre, informed the public of the events at the end of a performance of Die Himmelszelt, or Heaven\u2019s Tent, by the British playwright Lucy Kirkwood. Kusej said he had been \u201cin total shock\u201d before concentrating his efforts on attempting to keep 600 theatregoers calm. The time they had to wait was spent in part in a moderated conversation between the actors and the audience. Pope Francis has said he is praying for the victims of Monday night\u2019s attack. French police say a man in Paris who brandished a machete while walking through streets in the central Pere Lachaise area has been arrested in his hotel room. Witnesses reported the man to police, a spokesman said. There is no suggestion of a link to the Vienna attack, or even that the man planned to use the knife violently. However, authorities are on alert following a string of attacks in France. A few more details have emerged about the Vienna attacker. He is being referred to in Austrian media as Kujtim F, a dual citizen of Macedonia and Austria. The 20-year-old was arrested trying to cross the Turkish border into Syria, aiming to join the militant group Isis and was sentenced to 22 months in prison in April 2019. Under the rules governing youth sentences in Austria, he was released from prison early, in December 2019. According to the Austrian interior minister, Karl Nehammer, the attacker posted a picture on his Instagram account before the attack, showing him brandishing what looks like the two weapons he used. Our defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, reports Britain will be on the lookout for potential copycat attacks in the UK: Intelligence agencies in the UK are expected to be \u201cparticularly vigilant\u201d in the aftermath of the Vienna attack, which comes on the heels of a string of violent incidents in France and two days before a lockdown is due to begin in England. It is well-established that terror attacks in one country encourage copy cats elsewhere, although the overall number of jihadist plots in the European Union (including the UK) has been gradually declining as Isis was gradually rolled up in Syria and Iraq. There were 21 such plots last year, down from 24 according to data collected by European policing agency Europol, 14 of which were foiled and four of which failed. Intelligence sources added it was unclear, at this stage, if the attacks in Austria were timed to coincide with the last night before the start of a lockdown, when more people than usual would have been out in the evening and on the streets. But it would be prudent to take into account that timing in the run-up to the start of the England-wide lockdown expected to begin at just after midnight, in the small hours of Thursday. Witnesses to the attack in Vienna on Monday night have spoken to Austrian media about their experience of the dramatic events. \u201cI heard shots, but I have never heard anything like that. So in my naivety, I thought it was fireworks,\u201d one man told the tabloid Kurier. \u201cSomeone said to me, that must be gunshots. My girlfriend said to me to run into the pub and go right to the back,\u201d he said. One 53-year-old man told APA, the Austrian press agency, how he had been taken aback by the shooting during a business dinner in a pub on the Hoher Markt. \u201cWe heard the shots and then were told: \u2018turn off the lights, lock the doors\u2019,\u201d he said. All the guests lay on the floor. \u201cThe fear amongst the guests was just crazy,\u201d he added. A large group of police looked after the people in the restaurant, he said, and brought in passersby from the street to safety. \u201cAfter 10pm, the situation calmed down a bit. \u201cThe police were called off, and the area was said to have been secured.\u201d People in the restaurant were asked to leave the restaurant and to get away from the city centre, he said. Five people died during an attack in Vienna on Monday night, including two male civilians and two female, and one gunman who was killed by police. Authorities described the attacker as a 20-year-old \u201cIslamist terrorist\u201d with North Macedonian and Austrian citizenship. Fourteen people \u2013 including at least one police officer \u2013 were injured by gunfire and stabbing attacks, which broke out at 8pm. Seven victims were reported by medics to be in critical condition. The assaults occurred at six locations close to Seitenstettengasse in the heart of the Austrian capital. Police said they were not certain how many attackers were on the streets and several people have been arrested. The army has been deployed in the capital to back up law enforcement, as a widespread search continued on Tuesday. Earlier, authorities had said at least one gunman remained on the run. The interior minister, Karl Nehammer, had warned that the assailant was \u201cheavily armed and dangerous\u201d and urged the public to stay indoors until the all-clear was given. Schools will be closed in Vienna on Tuesday and the country has declared three days of mourning. World leaders have expressed their solidarity with the Austrian people. The Austrian president, Alexander Van der Bellen, has also just given a speech, in which he described Monday as a \u201cdark night\u201d following a \u201ccowardly terrorist attack on the heart of our society\u201d. The nation\u2019s deepest sympathy went out to all those who were fighting for their lives, and \u201cour tears are flowing\u201d for the victims and their relatives, he said. The attack had targeted \u201clife in a liberal democracy, which terrorists clearly hate deeply\u201d. He said Austrians would \u201cprotect and defend our values\u201d and added: \u201cHatred can never be as strong as our fellowship in freedom, in democracy, in tolerance and love.\u201d He concluded his short speech with: \u201cLong live our common and peaceful Europe.\u201d Here is more on the chancellor\u2019s speech, from my colleague, Kate Connolly: He said that the \u201cRepublic of Austria and its people have been the target of a brutal terror attack\u201d in which \u201cfour citizens have been cold-bloodedly murdered\u201d. Fourteen other people were injured, some of them seriously, he added. \u201cIt was an attack on our free society,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will defend our values.\u201d Kurz stressed that all of those behind the attack would be pursued. He added: \u201cThe enemy, the Islamist terror, wants to split our society. But we will give no space to this hatred. Our enemies are not the members of a religious community, these are terrorists. This is not a fight between Christians and Muslims, or Austrians and migrants, but a fight between civilisation and barbarity.\u201d He thanked the security services as well as the medical personnel and others \u201cwho through their civil courage have saved lives\u201d. The Israelitische Kultusgemeinde (IKG) in Austria, the organisation representing the Jewish community, has said it has closed all its synagogues and related institutes across the country, following Monday night\u2019s attacks in Vienna. The decision affects synagogues, as well as kosher restaurants, Jewish supermarkets, schools and cultural centres, said Erich Nuler, spokesman for the IKG\u2019s crisis committee, according to the Austrian daily Der Standard. Security has been stepped up at Jewish establishments across the country, he said and community members were being urged to stay at home. Nuler said it remained unclear whether or not the attack in which two people were shot in front of the city\u2019s main synagogue on Vienna\u2019s Seitenstettengasse was aimed at the Jewish community. The IKG was in close contact with security authorities, he said. Nuler added that the IKG\u2019s psycho-social counselling centre was being inundated with requests for help from community members. He said that much effort was being made to explain to children in particular what had happened on Monday evening. First details are emerging about the attacker who was shot dead by police. He was 20 years old and had north Macedonian roots, according to the interior minister, Karl Nehammer. He was a citizen of both Macedonia and Austria and had a criminal record related to terrorist activity. Nehammer said the man had been armed with an automatic rifle, a handgun, and a machete. He was also wearing a fake explosives belt. The minister added that 15 house raids had taken place across Vienna and St P\u00f6lten, about an hour from the Austrian capital. Several people had been arrested. Kurz has just begun addressing the Austrian nation, saying the victims were an older man, an older woman, a young passerby and a waitress. He described an injured police officer who tried to stop the attacker as \u201cbrave\u201d. Theatre- and opera-goers have described their shock as they became aware of the nearby attack while they watched the last cultural offerings ahead of a nationwide coronavirus shutdown on Tuesday. Visitors to the Staatsoper and the Burgtheater, the equivalent of Austria\u2019s national theatre, were first made aware of the incident after the venues\u2019 directors took to the respective stages to urge them to stay in their seats. Witnesses at the Staatsoper reported that its director, Bogdan Roscic, explained to them in front of the closed stage curtain what had happened, and told the audience that security forces had instructed they were not allowed to leave the building. One thousand people were reportedly present in the sold-out venue, as well as dozens of opera house employees. Audience members were only allowed to leave at 11.45pm, nearly four hours after the attack had begun. They were escorted by police to public transport facilities and urged to head straight home. \u201cWe were shaken, we did not know what was awaiting us. Many people were upset and exhausted,\u201d one opera fan said. Have you been affected by the shooting?

Seven people who were injured in last night\u2019s attack remain in a \u201ccritical, life-threatening\u201d condition, Dr Michael Binder, medical director of the Viennese health association, KAV, has told the Austrian radio programme \u00d61 Journal. \u201cSeven people are seriously injured and we\u2019re dealing with bullet as well as stab wounds,\u201d he said. He said not all the relatives of those who were injured have yet been informed. A spokeswoman for the health association said that in total 17 people were injured in the attack and they are being treated at several hospitals in the Austrian capital. She also confirmed that they were dealing primarily with gunshot wounds, but also with stab wounds. Ten people had medium to light injuries, she said. \u201cThe patients are in a state of shock,\u201d she said, adding that the 28-year-old police officer who is among the injured is in a critical but stable state. No other information has been released so far about the identity of the injured. The Austrian state has declared three days of mourning starting today, following the attack. A minute\u2019s silence will take place at midday local time today to remember the victims and flags on official buildings will fly at half-mast. The Austrian government has now confirmed reports that five people have died, including a suspected attacker who was shot dead by police. Interior minister Karl Nehammer said the civilians, two men and two women, died from their injuries. Seventeen others were wounded in the shooting. The national broadcaster, ORF, has reported a fourth civilian, a woman, has died. That would bring the death toll to two male civilians and two female. One attacker, a man, was also killed. The Austria Press Agency (APA) says seven others are in a life-threatening condition. The City of Vienna has shared numbers to call for those feeling \u201coverwhelmed\u201d. Two of Austria\u2019s neighbours, Germany and the Czech Republic, have stepped up border checks in case any suspected attackers attempt to flee the country. Police officers were carrying out random checks on vehicles and passengers, Czech police said. It is worth a reminder here that we still do not have confirmation from Austrian authorities on the exact number of attackers. One suspect is dead and the interior minister said overnight that at least one \u201cheavily armed and dangerous\u201d person was believed to still be at large. Austria\u2019s interior minister has repeated his request that people remain at home if they can, as police search for possible additional attackers. \u201cPlease avoid the city centre,\u201d Karl Nehammer tweeted on Tuesday morning. Schools are also closed, he added, asking parents to look after their children at home. The deceased attacker has been described by Austria\u2019s interior minister as an Islamic State sympathiser. On Monday, an Islamic State-affiliated group of militants in Afghanistan killed at least 22 people during an assault on a Kabul University book fair, taking hostages and fighting gun battles with security forces for more than five hours. Today has been declared a national day of mourning for Afghanistan. Here is our full story on that horrific attack: Hello. Oliver here, taking over the live blog. It is after 8am in Vienna, roughly 12 hours since the attack began, and police are still searching for possible accomplices. I will be keeping you updated on all the latest news. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thank you sincerely to those of you who reached out to the Guardian during the night despite all that was going on. I\u2019ll leave you with comments from a reader named Lea: \u201cGreetings from Vienna, an indestructible city. We will rise stronger than ever,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThere is a reason why everyone is saying \u201cWien ist anders [Vienna is different, a common slogan in the city]\u201d. My colleague Oliver Holmes will be with you from now on. You can read the story on how the night unfolded here: Austrian state broadcaster ORF reports that several people have been arrested and that seven police officers \u201cmade use of their service weapons on Monday evening in the course of the terrorist attack\u201d. Also, here is more detail from that press conference earlier: The perpetrator was \u201cneutralized\u201d at 8:09pm, said Vienna\u2019s police chief Gerhard P\u00fcrstl at the joint press conference with Nehammer in the morning. According to the general director for public security, Franz Ruf, the perpetrator\u2019s apartment was forcibly opened with explosives and searched. The interior minister did not answer the question of whether a detonation perceived by witnesses during the night in Simmering could have been this opening of the apartment. There was also no information on whether other people were found at his home address during the house search or whether other people were reported there. German chancellor Angela Merkel has responded to the news that the known attacker was an Islamic State sympathiser, saying Islamist terrorism is a \u201ccommon enemy\u201d, Reuters reports. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has called the attack \u201cdastardly\u201d, and says he is \u201cdeeply shocked and saddened\u201d: Here is our story on the Islamic State sympathiser who led a terrorist shooting attack on Vienna on Monday night, killing at least three people. Austrian police are searching for accomplices who might still be at large. A series of shooting in Vienna\u2019s city centre left two women and one man dead. One attacker was killed by police. Twelve hours after the assault, it is unclear if the man acted alone, or how many other terrorists were involved. Fifteen people \u2013 including at least one police officer \u2013 were seriously injured in exchanges of gunfire, which broke out at 8pm. Seven victims were reported to be in critical condition. Police were trawling through more than 20,000 videos given to authorities by members of the public to determine how many assailants were involved and the exact course of events. Initially, police said the shootings took place in six locations in Vienna\u2019s 1st district near the Danube Canal, and warned of a group of \u201cheavily armed and dangerous\u201d gunmen. But by Tuesday morning police were not certain how many attackers were involved. \u201cAt the moment we think there\u2019s more, we\u2019re investigating,\u201d Vienna police chief Gerhard P\u00fcrstl said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say for sure if it was one or several attackers. Lots of witnesses are injured, traumatised, and we have to analyse the data. \u201cThis will take some time \u2026 at this stage there is no definite answer.\u201d Border checks have been increased to neighbouring countries: Four people died in the Vienna attacks on Monday night, including one attacker. Two male civilians and one female were also killed. Fifteen people were seriously injured. Austria\u2019s interior minister, Karl Nehammer, described the attacker as an \u201cIslamist terrorist\u201d and said he believes there was more than one attacker and investigations were continuing. Authorities were unable to confirm whether the attack was antisemitic, but said that the attack was definitely carried out by a \u201cradicalised person\u201d. Earlier in the press conference, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said, \u201cwe have experienced an attack from an Islamist terrorist.\u201d Earlier, authorities said at least one gunman remained on the run at 1am Vienna time. He warned the assailants were \u201cheavily armed and dangerous\u201d and urged the public to stay indoors until the all-clear was given. 15 people were injured and taken to hospital after the attack that began shortly after 8pm local time on Monday. One of the injured is thought to be a policeman. Seven of the injured were in a serious condition, Vienna\u2019s mayor Michael Ludwig, said. The attacks began with volleys of gunfire and the injury and death tolls are expected to rise. One attacker was shot by police outside St Rupert\u2019s Church. He was carrying an assault rifle, handguns and ammunition. His body was also found with an explosives vest. Later police said on Twitter that the explosives vest was fake. The assaults, by an unknown number of shooters carrying long firearms, occurred at six locations close to Seitenstettengasse in the heart of the Austrian capital. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, described the assaults as a \u201cdefinitely\u201d terror attack that had been \u201cvery professionally\u201d planned. Police have searched the home of the attacker. They asked people not to share videos and images on social media of the attacks, but said 20,000 videos were given to them. Police have told residents to keep away from the centre of Vienna. The attack occurred on the last night before a new coronavirus lockdown was due to come into force in the city. Schools will be closed in Vienna on Tuesday. EU, US and other world leaders have expressed their solidarity with the Austrian people. The Vienna Police Department has tweeted the information they can confirm so far. It is the following: 3 deceased persons (2 male, 1 female) [It is unclear whether he attacker is included in this total, as earlier reports listed three civilians as dead] 15 severely injured persons, among them is an officer of the Vienna PD The assault was carried out by at least one suspect who was shot and killed by officers The suspect was armed with an assault rifle, among other handguns The suspect was appearing to wear an explosive vest [earlier reports listed this as a \u2018belt\u2019] which turned out to be a dummy The suspect\u2019s apartment has been opened by SWAT and searched The sighting and evaluation of the numerous footage is happening at the moment The Vienna Police have just tweeted the following information about what is known so far. They list three people as having died but it is unclear whether the attacker is included among the toll. We will bring you more as soon as we know. The Vienna police have confirmed that the explosive belt worn by the attacker, who they described as an Islamic State sympathiser, was fake. In that press conference which ended a moment ago Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said that the known attacker was an Islamic State sympathiser. He was armed with an explosive belt which tuned out to be fake and carried a bag of ammunition. He was killed by police. Nehammer also repeated calls for the public to stay at home on Tuesday. Death toll climbs to four. Vienna\u2019s police chief, Franz Ruf, confirmed that a third civilian had died in the attacks, bringing the toll to two men and one woman. One attacker, a man, has also been killed. Authorities were unable to confirm whether the attack was antisemitic, but said that the attack was definitely carried out by a \u201cradicalised person\u201d. Earlier in the press conference, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said, \u201cwe have experienced an attack from an Islamist terrorist.\u201d There was at least one known attacker. He was killed by police. but authorities suspect there were more. The attacker wore an explosive belt and carried a bag of ammunition. The home of the known attacker has been searched. Authorities were unable to reveal what was discovered. The police have been sent more than 20,000 videos and are searching the content. Nehammer said, \u201cAustria is a democracy, shaped by free speech, tolerance in living together,\u201d and that \u201cThe attack yesterday is an attack of these values and an inadequate attempt to divide us. We will not stand for this. There will be consequences.\u201d Florian Klenk, the editor of Austrian news magazine Falter has tweeted that, \u201cNehammer did everything right in the [press conference]. Emphasize the unity of the country, fundamental rights and democratic principles. No escalation, but calm, empathic words that make it clear to the terrorists that Vienna cannot be divided. Hopefully this rhetoric stays the same.\u201d Many thanks to my colleague Svetlana Stankovic (Guardian Australia\u2019s deputy opinion editor) for translating that press conference in record time. I\u2019ll have a summary up shortly. Vienna\u2019s police force has confirmed that three civilians and one attacker have died. Two of the civilians were male and one was female. The attacker was male. This means the death toll has risen by one since we were last updated. Ruf and Nehammer are asked whether the attack was definitely antisemitic. \u201cIt is clear that it is a radicalised person, further we can\u2019t say anything as we\u2019re still investigating,\u201d they respond. Ruf and Nehammer are unable to confirm what was found at the home of the attacker or how hold he was, they say. The authorities at the press conference are asked whether it is possible there was just one attacker. \u201cAt the moment we think there are more, we\u2019re investigating,\u201d Ruf responds. Another person \u2013 I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t catch who \u2013 adds later, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say for sure if it was one or several attackers. Lots of witnesses are injured, traumatised. We have to analyse data, have to ask for your understanding that this will take some time. At this stage there is no definite answer.\u201d Ruf confirms that further police personnel will be supplied to Vienna from other parts of the country. Ruf adds, \u201cThis has showed how important routine police work is. It made sure that the attacker was found quickly. There was a minimal time of chaos and all public areaes could be coordinated.\u201d \u201cWe have started professional investigations we\u2019ll focus on making sure people in Vienna will feel secure again. Thank you to police and all partners who have worked with us in this difficult hours.\u201d Vienna\u2019s Director General for Public Security Franz Ruf is speaking now. He says, \u201cWe have worked intensely on identifying the attacker.\u201d \u201cThe home of the violent attacker was searched. 20,000 video were uploaded and given to us, and we have already searched 20% of this content.\u201d (a note that we didn\u2019t quite catch that percentage figure, but we thing it was 20%). Nehammer: \u201cTerror and violence definitely have no place in our society. We won\u2019t let our freedom be taken away from us.\u201d Nehammer has confirmed that the attacker who was killed was \u201cheavily armed with an explosive belt, and were his sympathisers\u201d. \u201cWe have increased checks in public areas.\u201d \u201cThe police have done an outstanding job,\u201d he says. \u201cEven those who were on holidays \u2013 a big thank you to them and to other countries for their assistance.\u201d \u201cThere are investigations currently that I can\u2019t reveal at the moment,\u201d says Nehammer. \u201cFor people in Vienna: if possible, stay home. There\u2019s no school today, so if you can leave your child at home today, you can do so.\u201d \u201cAustria is a democracy, shaped by free speech, tolerance in living together,\u201d says Nehammer. \u201cThe attack yesterday is an attack of these values and an inadequate attempt to divide us. We will not stand for this. There will be consequences,\u201d he says. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer is speaking now: \u201cMy thoughts in these difficult hours are with the victims and the relatives. We think of the dead and injured, including one officer on duty,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have experienced an attack from an Islamist terrorist.\u201d You can watch the update from the Vienna Police at the link below \u2013 we will bring you the key points in English. As we wait for the police press conference to begin \u2013 it is scheduled to start in 5 minutes, here is how some foreigners currently living in Vienna experienced the attacks. Louis Glen is from the UK but has recently moved to Vienna to study. He wrote earlier: A really frightening atmosphere in the city tonight, even now at 3am I can hear helicopters and sirens over the city. Thankfully I\u2019m safe and well, my flatmates only returning home in the last hour after being locked in the city centre [...] It\u2019s a great shame to see such a beautiful and peaceful place shattered by these acts\u201d Comhall Fanning is Irish, and this is his second year living in Vienna. He works as an English Language Assistant: I think I\u2019m mainly feeling a profound sense of shock tonight. There is no one that I\u2019m sleeping. The shooting happened around [3km]] from my apartment. I have always seen Vienna as an incredibly safe city. I would never have imagined anything like this happening here. Here is our full report on how the attacks unfolded last night: Ben Doherty and Helen Sullivan: Monday night in Vienna was supposed to be a last chance at freedom. The weather was mild, and as the hours ticked down before a nationwide coronavirus curfew largely shut down the city for a month, the bars and restaurants of the \u201cBermuda triangle\u201d \u2013 a network of narrow, fashionable lanes in the old city\u2019s 1st district \u2013 were busy. Diners and drinkers sat at tables outside, enjoying a last moment of revelry before another pandemic lockdown amid the full blast of winter. Without warning, at 8pm on Seitenstettengasse street, a winding cobbled boulevard a block back from the Danube Canal, the shooting started: US president Donald Trump has tweeted about the attack, calling it \u201cevil\u201d and a \u201cvile act of terrorism.\u201d \u201cThe US stands with Austria, France, and all of Europe in the fight against terrorists, including radical Islamic terrorists,\u201d Trump wrote A reminder that you can get in touch with me directly via email on helen.sullivan@theguardian.com or Twitter @helenrsullivan. A sincere thank you to those who have written to us already. We hope to have more updates from people who are currently in Vienna as the city wakes up. It is currently nearly 5.30 am. The police are due to hold a press conference at 6am. Three people have died in the Vienna attacks on Monday night, including two civilians and one attacker. At least one gunman remained on the run at 1am Vienna time, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said. He warned the assailants were \u201cheavily armed and dangerous\u201d and urged the public to stay indoors until the all-clear was given. 15 people were injured and taken to hospital after the attack that began shortly after 8pm local time on Monday. One of the injured is thought to be a policeman. Seven of the injured were in a serious condition, Vienna\u2019s mayor Michael Ludwig, said. The attacks began with volleys of gunfire and the injury and death tolls are expected to rise. The dead attacker is believed to have been shot outside St Rupert\u2019s Church. Some early reports suggested he wearing an explosive belt, but police have not confirmed this. The assaults, by an unknown number of shooters carrying long firearms, occurred at six locations close to Seitenstettengasse in the heart of the Austrian capital. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, described the assaults as \u201cdefinitely\u201d being a terror attack. He added that it had been \u201cvery professionally\u201d planned. Kurz has called the military onto the streets of Vienna. Police and security authorities have asked people not to share videos and images on social media of the attacks. Authorities have said is hampering attempts to neutralise the offenders. Police have told residents to keep away from the centre of Vienna. Early reports suggested the nearby Stadttempel synagogue could have been the target of the attack. But Oskar Deutsch, president of Vienna\u2019s Jewish community, said the synagogue on Seitenstettengasse was closed at the time of the attack. He told the Kurier newspaper it was \u201cunclear\u201d if it was a target. The attack occurred on the last night before a new coronavirus lockdown was due to come into force in the city. Schools will be closed in Vienna on Tuesday. EU and other world leaders have expressed their solidarity with the Austrian people. As far as we understand, there is still one attacker currently being looked for by police. \u201cWe have brought several special forces units together that are now searching for the presumed terrorists. I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna, because these are mobile perpetrators,\u201d Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told national broadcaster ORF late on Monday. Kurz said the army would protect sites in the capital so the police could focus on anti-terror operations. Speaking to ORF, he said the attackers \u201cwere very well equipped with automatic weapons\u201d and had \u201cprepared professionally\u201d. Nehammer is due to hold a news conference on the situation at 6am lockal time (5am GMT) on Tuesday \u2013 just over an hour from now. White House National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien has commented on the attacks, saying in a statement posted to the National Security Council\u2019s Twitter account, \u201cThere is no justification for hatred and violence like this.\u201d Gruber said that when they emerged from the cafe, they saw police on the street corners pointing their weapons. Once the crowd had arrived at Schwedenplatz, the police asked them to raise their hands and to show they were not carrying weapons. \u201cThat is the first time police ever aimed at me with their guns,\u201d he said. They were told to take the subway, and Gruber and his friends travelled to another friend\u2019s house where they stayed for a few hours before travelling home by cab. When we spoke, it was 4.30 in the morning an he was at home in the 16th district of Vienna. He had locked a gate that was almost never closed, he said. \u201cI think that this is an experience that almost nobody who lives here has ever had before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to several countries and have heard and watched about these attacks [in those countries],\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never been close to one. It was really frightening.\u201d I have just spoken on the phone to Gernot Gruber, a 24-year-old business student in Vienna. When the attacks began, Gruber was walking to the Hard Rock cafe in Vienna\u2019s city centre, 100m from one of the attacks. He had his headphones in, he said and when he took them out to greet the friend he was meeting for dinner, he heard several loud bangs. \u201cIf you hear these noises in Austria you don\u2019t think they\u2019re gunshots, you really don\u2019t,\u201d he said. He thought they might be fireworks set off by people celebrating before the lockdown began. But when he and his friend entered the Hard Rock cafe, they heard an American saying he thought the sound was gunshots. He and his friend followed the man downstairs as upstairs the restaurant staff locked the doors and told people to get away from the windows. A few minutes later, special forces police entered the building and told everyone to leave and run towards Schwedenplatz, away from the attack which was happening 100m away. The exclamation mark on the map below shows where the attack occurred. Joe Biden has tweeted his condolences saying that he and his wife Jill \u201care keeping the victims and their families in our prayers. We must all stand united against hate and violence.\u201d Here is our video report about the attack tonight in Vienna: At 3.30am in Vienna, there are still helicopters circling overhead, readers have told me. Because it was the last night before Vienna\u2019s lockdown came into effect, many people were taking the opportunity to go out for one last time. While some who were in the city have finally made it home, others are spending the night in the places they were at when the attacks began. I have heard from the friends of lawyers sleeping at their offices, from attendees at a barre class that ended shortly after 8pm who are sleeping in the studio and from Markus Husa, who was at a restaurant nearby. He says that he started to receive text messages at 9pm and that \u201cat that time the first people were leaving the restaurant we were at, unaware of the situation.\u201d His group informed the restaurant staff, who locked the doors and told people to stay inside. \u201cAs I understand now, one site of shootings was a mere 100 meters from our location. It was difficult to get home as public transport didn\u2019t stop anywhere near the first district, it was impossible to get a taxi and the city was to be avoided. Fortunately, a friend picked us up by car,\u201d he says. He says that friends of his were held in cinemas and theatres and have just arrived home. We didn\u2019t experience any first hand threat nor police in particular. Friends of mine were held for considerable stretches of time at theatres and cinemas, venues were evacuated by police, many of us just got home in past hour or so. The Vienna Police have announced that its \u201cinvestigations regarding the assault will go on highest level\u201d and that all available resources will be used to maintain public security in the city. Here is the message in German for our Austrian readers: Here is more from Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister, who told London\u2019s LBC radio he was living in the compound of the central Vienna synagogue. \u201cUpon hearing shots, we looked down (from) the windows and saw the gunmen shooting at the guests of the various bars and pubs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gunmen were running around and shooting at least 100 rounds or even more in front of our building,\u201d he said. A reminder that you can get in touch with me directly via email on helen.sullivan@theguardian.com or Twitter @helenrsullivan. A sincere thank you to those who have written to us already. We hope to have more updates from people who are currently in Vienna throughout the night. Vienna Mayor Vienna Mayor Michael Ludwig says that 15 people have been hospitalised, seven with serious injuries. As far as we understand, two civilians have died in the attacks. In case you are just joining us: Police said that several shots were fired shortly after 8pm on Monday. (1900 GMT) on a lively street in the city centre in Vienna, and that there were six shooting locations. Unverified footage posted on social media showed gunmen walking through the streets, apparently shooting at people at random, wounding several people. The attack occurred on the last night before a new coronavirus lockdown was due to come into force in the city. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told public broadcaster ORF that the army had been asked to guard key locations in the city to allow police to pursue the gunmen. Kurz praised police for killing one of the attackers and vowed: \u201cWe will not never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means.\u201d The terror attacks in Vienna have been widely condemned by international leaders. Here is what some of them have had to say: In recent years, Austria has been spared the sort of large-scale attacks seen in Paris, Berlin and London. In August, authorities arrested a 31-year-old Syrian refugee suspected of trying to attack a Jewish community leader in the country\u2019s second city Graz, Reuters reports. The leader was unhurt. We have some more information from Vienna Mayor Michael Ludwig about the second victim. Ludwig told the broadcaster ORF that a woman wounded in an attack in central Vienna on Monday night has died of her injuries. Her death brings the civilian toll to two. It is understood that at least one attacker has also died. A reader named Lea R has written to us from Vienna\u2019s second district, Leopoldstadt. \u201cI\u2019m living in Karmeliterviertel, one of the largest Jewish communities (I myself am not Jewish). I am 22 and normally I\u2019m every evening at Schwedenplatz/ Bermudadreieck and Donaukanal, being in one of the many Bars there ,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe Situation right now is really scary, my phone is ringing all the time because everyone is so worried. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see my beloved hometown [like this].\u201d She says that the law firm where she works has told employees to work from home tomorrow. Her ex-boyfriend works for WEGA, the police special forces (Wiener Einsatzgruppe Alarmabteilung) and, she says, \u201cCurrently I am worrying a lot about his well-being, as he is actively looking for the terrorists.\u201d A friend of hers is spending the night sleeping in her office. There is the \u201cconstant noise\u201d of helicopters overhead, says Lea. She signs off: Greetings from Vienna, an undestructable city. We will rise stronger than ever! There is no place here for terrorism, neither left, right or from a religious point of view. There is a reason why everyone is saying \u201cWien ist anders [Vienna is different, a common slogan in the city]\u201d. The Mayor of Vienna, Michael Ludwig, has announced that a second civilian has died in the attacks tonight, Reuters reports. The head of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has voiced expressed the UN\u2019s \u201csolidarity with the people &amp; government of Austria.\u201d In a statement posted online his spokesperson, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, wrote: The Secretary-General is following with utmost concern the still evolving situation in Vienna\u2019s city centre where violent attacks in several places have been reported today, with at least one bystander killed and several others wounded, including members of the security forces. He extends his deep condolences to the family of the victim and wishes those injured a speedy recovery. The Secretary-General strongly condemns these attacks and reaffirms the solidarity of the United Nations with the people and the Government of Austria. The Vienna police have again urged people to stay at home, confirming that the incident is \u201cstill active\u201d in a post retweeted from two hours ago. The Guardian understands that \u201cseveral\u201d people have died in the attacks tonight \u2013 this is what was said in the police press conference a short while ago by the interior minister, Karl Nehammer. Authorities have not yet confirmed an exact number, but they have confirmed that among the casualties are one civilian and one attacker. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has sent his condolences, calling the attack \u201chorrific and heartbreaking.\u201d \u201cWe condemn in the strongest terms possible this act of terrorism,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. If you are following along from Vienna and would like to speak to me, you can send me an email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com or message me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. The City of Vienna has tweeted confirming that children do not need to attend school tomorrow, after it was announced in the police press conference a short while ago. \u201cDue to the current situation, there will be no compulsory education in Vienna tomorrow. Children can therefore stay at home, excused. For all those for whom this is not possible, the schools are of course open. Stay safe and above all healthy!\u201d the Tweet reads. The explosive belt we mentioned earlier \u2013 reported to have been worn by an attacker who has since been shot \u2013 is currently being defused by the demining service, the Austrian broadcaster ORF reports: According to the information provided by the crisis team to the ORF, the suspected perpetrator shot was wearing an explosives belt. This is currently being defused by the demining service. He is also said to have carried a lot of ammunition with him. At that press conference, Austria\u2019s interior minister, Karl Nehammer, called Monday the \u201chardest day for Austria several years,\u201d the BBC reports. Initial reports had suggested that the nearby Stadttempel synagogue could have been the target of the attack. But Oskar Deutsch, president of the Jewish Community Vienna, said the synagogue on Seitenstettengasse and the office building at the same address were already closed at the time of the attack, and it was \u201cunclear\u201d if it was one of the targets of the attack. Deutsch told the Kurier newspaper that no members of Vienna\u2019s Jewish community were among those injured in the attack. Citing an interview with a rabbi living directly above the synagogue, Kurier reported an attacker had taken random shots at people sitting outside cafes and bars on Judengasse and Seitenstettengasse in central Vienna. \u201cHe did not aim at the Stadttempel [synagogue],\u201d the witness said. The synagogue was the target of a terror attack almost four decades ago. On 29 August 1981, two members of the Palestinian group Fatah \u2013 The Revolutionary Council, also known as ANO \u2013 tried to storm the synagogue building but were stopped by security forces. Two people were killed and 21 others injured in the attack: There will be another press conference at 6am tomorrow, the police have said. That press conference has now ended. Austrian interior minister Karl Nehammer has said that \u201cseveral\u201d people have died in the attack. He has also said: \u2022 At least one attacker still on the run \u2022 Children not required to go to school on Tuesday \u2022 He has repeated the appeal to the public to avoid central Vienna That press conference has started. We will bring you updates in English shortly. You can watch it live here. Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Monday night that the attack in the heart of Vienna was \u201cdefinitely\u201d a terror attack that had been \u201cvery professionally\u201d planned. Citing government sources, broadcaster ORF reported that the gunman shot by police outside St Rupert\u2019s Church was carrying an explosive belt and a bag filled with a large amount of ammunition. Several special forces units have been brought together to search for \u201cmobile perpetrators\u201d who are still believed to be at large. Oskar Deutsch, the president of the Jewish Community Vienna said on Twitter that all synagogues, Jewish schools, kosher restaurants and supermarkets would remain closed on Tuesday. We will be bringing you that police conference live as it happens. The Vienna police will be delivering an address shortly via their facebook page, they have announced on Twitter. \u201cOn our Facebook page there will soon be a live stream of press statements from BM Nehammer, LPP P\u00fcrstl and General Director f. d. Public security,\u201d they said. The Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann reports that, according to ORF, a gunman has been shot outside St Ruper\u2019s Church. He is reported to have been carrying or wearing an explosive belt and a bag containing ammunition. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. As we bring you the latest, please know that you can contact me with news tips, questions or comments at any point on Twitter @helenrsullivan and via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Here is what we know so far about this evening\u2019s events: At least one civilian has been killed, and 15 people injured, in a terrorist attack in central Vienna that began shortly after 8pm local time on Monday. The attacks began with volleys of gunfire, and authorities said several attackers remained at large several hours later. The injury and death tolls are expected to rise. At least one attacker has been confirmed dead. The assaults, by an unknown number of shooters carrying long firearms, occurred at six locations close to Seitenstettengasse in the heart of the Austrian capital. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, described the assaults as a terror attack and has called the military onto the streets of Vienna. \u201cWe are currently going through difficult times in our republic. I would like to thank all the emergency services who risk their lives, especially today for our safety. Our police will take decisive action against the perpetrators of this hideous terrorist attack,\u201d Kurz said. The interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said several attackers were still at large at midnight, and warned they were \u201cheavily armed and dangerous\u201d. \u201cWe have brought several special forces units together that are now searching for the presumed terrorists. I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna because these are mobile perpetrators,\u201d Nehammer told broadcaster ORF, urging the public to stay indoors until the all-clear was given. Police and security authorities have asked people not to share videos and images on social media of the attacks. Authorities have said is hampering attempts to neutralise the offenders.

EU and other world leaders have expressed their solidarity with the Austrian people. That\u2019s where I will leave you for today, but Helen Sullivan is here to take you through the rest of the unfolding news. My colleague Ben Doherty has put together this wrap of everything we know so far: The AFP news agency has put together this wrap up of EU\u2019s leader\u2019s reactions to the attacks in Vienna, as they vow to stand by Austria. France French President Emmanuel Macron said: \u201cWe French share the shock and sorrow of the Austrian people following the attack in Vienna. \u201cAfter France, it is a friendly nation that has been attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they\u2019re dealing with. We will concede nothing,\u201d he tweeted in both French and German. Germany Germany\u2019s foreign ministry vowed not to \u201cgive in to hate that is supposed to divide our societies. \u201cEven if we can\u2019t yet foresee the extent of the terror, our thoughts are with the wounded and the victims in these difficult hours,\u201d the ministry wrote on Twitter, calling the news from neighbouring Austria \u201chorrifying and disturbing\u201d. Italy Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said there was \u201cno room for hatred and violence in our common European home,\u201d while his foreign minister Luigi Di Maio tweeted that \u201cEurope must react\u201d. EU EU Council chief Charles Michel said that \u201cEurope strongly condemns this cowardly act that violates life and our human values. My thoughts are with the victims and the people of \u001dVienna in the wake of tonight\u2019s horrific attack. We stand with Austria\u201d. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that she was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d, saying her \u201cthoughts are with the families of the victims and the Austrian people.\u201d The president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, said he felt \u201csadness and horror\u201d and the EU\u2019s top diplomat Josep Borrell called it \u201ca cowardly act of violence and hate.\u201d Czech Republic In the Czech Republic, which neighbours Austria, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he was \u201chorrified by the attack... and I want to express my solidarity to all people in Austria and my friend Sebastian Kurz\u201d. Greece Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted that he was \u201cShocked by the horrific attacks in \u001dVienna\u201d and had offered Kurz Athens\u2019 \u201cfull solidarity\u201d. \u201cOur thoughts are with the people in Vienna and the authorities dealing with the situation. Our hearts, with the victims and their loved ones,\u201d Mitsotakis added Vienna City Hospital chief has spoken to Austrian broadcaster ORF. He says 15 people have been injured in the attack, either hurt in the shooting or while fighting. This has not been confirmed by police at this point. This is consistent with a previous statement from Vienna mayor Michael Ludwig, who told ORF that 15 people were being treated in Vienna hospitals and that seven were in a serious condition. Chris Zhao, a student in Vienna, was in a restaurant when the attack took place. He told the BBC he heard between 20 and 30 bangs that sounded like firecrackers just after 8 pm. The manager locked the door to the restaurant at first, but when he left Zhao says he saw several people injured and one body \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in shock.\u201d Czech police said they had started random checks on the country\u2019s border with Austria following Monday\u2019s attack near a Vienna synagogue that had left at least two dead and several injured. \u201cPolice are carrying out random checks of vehicles and passengers on border crossings with Austria as a preventive measure in relation to the terror attack in Vienna,\u201d Czech police tweeted. This comes after the Austrian interior minister confirmed law enforcement was expanding their search for mobile attackers outside of Vienna. Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said in a tweet Czech police were also in touch with Austrian colleagues following the \u201cdreadful news from Vienna\u201d. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis tweeted his condolences over the attack near the Stadttempel synagogue. \u201cI am horrified by the attack on the Vienna synagogue and I want to express my solidarity to all people in Austria and my friend (Austrian Chancellor) Sebastian Kurz,\u201d Babis tweeted. EU leaders have also expressed solidarity with the Austrian people Here is an update from Reuters, recapping the Interior minister\u2019s comments to ORF: Several suspected perpetrators of what the Austrian government is calling a terror attack in Vienna are on the loose and a manhunt is underway, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said on Monday, calling the attackers \u201cheavily armed and dangerous.\u201d \u201cWe have brought several special forces units together that are now searching for the presumed terrorists. I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna because these are mobile perpetrators,\u201d Nehammer told broadcaster ORF, urging the public to stay indoors until the all-clear is given Graphic and unconfirmed, videos are being shared around social media, showing people shot and bleeding near the outside tables of local restaurants. Vienna police have urgently and repeatedly asked that no video or photographs be shared on social media. The interior minister suggested some attackers may still be mobile, therefore providing any information on social media about there whereabouts of police locations could be dangerous. Earlier reports had suggested that the nearby Stadttempel synagogue could have been the target of the attack. But Oskar Deutsch, president of the Jewish Community Vienna, said the synagogue on Seitenstettengasse and the office building at the same address were already closed at the time of the attack, and it was \u201cunclear\u201d if it was one of the targets of the attack. Deutsch told the Kurier newspaper that no members of Vienna\u2019s Jewish community were among those injured in the attack. Citing an interview with a rabbi living directly above the Stadttempel synagogue, newspaper Kurier reported an attacker had taken random shots at people sitting outside cafes and bars on Judengasse and Seitenstettengasse in central Vienna. \u201cHe did not aim at the Stadttempel [synagogue]\u201d, the witness said. The Stadttempel synagogue was the target of a terror attack almost four decades ago. On 29 August 1981 two members of the Palestinian group Fatah \u2013 The Revolutionary Council, also known as ANO, tried to storm the synagogue building but were stoppedat the gatesby security forces. Two people were killed and 21 others injured in the attack. Austria\u2019s minister for the interior Karl Nehammer spoke on ORF TV a short time ago. He confirmed that police are still in the process of fighting the presumed terrorists. He said they are still looking for the potential perpetrators and some attackers may still be mobile. Video and pictures are circulating online of a number of men, shirtless with their arms up in the air, being approached by heavily armed police. It\u2019s unknown if these men are directly involved in the attack. The number of attackers, or how many groups are involved is also unknown. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has labelled the Vienna shooting a \u201chideous terrorist attack\u201d. He says that armed forces will be taking over some police operations to allow police to focus on their anti-terror efforts. Roughly translated he says: We are currently going through difficult times in our republic. I would like to thank all the emergency services who risk their lives, especially today for our safety. Our police will take decisive action against the perpetrators of this hideous terrorist attack. I am glad that our police officers have already been able to eliminate a perpetrator. We will never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks resolutely by all means. So that the police can concentrate fully on the fight against terrorism, the federal government has decided that the armed forces will take over the property protection previously carried out by the police in Vienna with immediate effect. The whole country is in thoughts with the victims, injured and their families, to whom I express my deepest condolences. We thank the leaders of the European Union and our international partners for their sympathy and the expressions of solidarity. At least one civilian and one attacker have been confirmed dead in Vienna says Harald Soro, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. A Rabbi has described what he the attack to The Associated Press. Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person fire shots at people sitting outside bars in the street below his window. His account of the shooting remains unconfirmed by Vienna Police. \u201cThey were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,\u201d Hofmeister said. \u201cAll these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,\u201d he added. \u201cAs of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.\u201d Online a large wave of anti-immigrant sentiment has already begun to emerge, in the wake of the attack. Currently, no information on the identity of any attackers has been released, and their nationality and the motivation for the attack is currently unknown. French President Emmanuel Macron has tweeted his solidarity with Austria. France has also been the victim of several attacks in recent weeks, although the Austrian shooters\u2019 motivation is still unknown. Roughly translated he says: We, the French, share the shock and sadness of the Austrians after an attack in Vienna. It is a friendly country that is under attack. This is our Europe. Our enemies need to know who they are dealing with. We won\u2019t give in to anything. Here is the Guardian\u2019s report for those who want to catch up on the news from Vienna so far. It\u2019s understood that the first of six locations of the attack at Seitenstettengasse, a street close the centre of the Vienna CBD. The prime minister of the Netherlands has tweeted his support to the Austrian government. An unconfirmed video posted by a member of the public appears to show a number of men, standing shirtless, unarmed with their arms up. The video was taken through the window of a nearby apartment. Authorities have not confirmed if all attackers have been arrested or not and police have urged all people not to post photos or videos to social media. So just unpacking that update from the Vienna police a little bit. Authorities have confirmed that this was not a single shooting attack but spread across six different locations. It\u2019s unclear if these were the same attackers moving to six different locations or simultaneous attacks. The Seitenstettengasse square was the first of these locations, and the attacked consisted of multiple people armed with rifles. One suspect has been shot and killed by police. Several people have been injured including a police officer. The national Austrian broadcaster, ORF says emergency services in Vienna are reporting \u201cseveral dead and injured:\u201d. The Guardian can not confirm, but local media reports have suggested that between three and eight people have been killed. This has not been verified by authorities at this point. The APA news agency previously reported an update from Austria\u2019s interior ministry stating one attacker was \u201cdead\u201d. While many of the initial reports suggested the attack was at the Stadttempel synagogue, the Jewish community of Vienna Oskar Deutsch, confirmed the temple and nearby offices were closed at the time. Here is his statement on Twitter. Roughly translated he says: \u201cIt cannot be said at the moment whether Stadttempel was one of the targets. What is certain, however, is that both the synagogue in Seitenstettengasse and the office building at the same address were no longer in operation and closed at the time of the first shots.\u201d In any case, there was shooting in the immediate vicinity of Stadttempel. All parishioners were asked not to enter public streets and to remain in closed rooms until the all-clear from the security authorities. Here is the initial post from the Vienna police department. Rough Translation: \u201cThere were several exchanges of fire around the inner city. Several people are injured. We are on the scene with all available forces. Please avoid all public places in the city.\u201d Police have urged people not to share any photos or video on social media, translating the message into several languages. Hello, and thank you for joining us. Several people have been wounded in Vienna, after an \u201capparent terrorist attack\u201d near a synagogue, with one of several attackers arrested. Multiple gunshots were fired near Schwedenplatz in central Vienna on Monday evening, according to police, near a major synagogue. Minister of the Interior, Karl Nehammer said several people were injured and some believed to be killed. \u201cAt the moment I can confirm we believe this is an apparent terror attack,\u201d he told Austrian broadcaster ORF. Police have urged residents to keep away from all public places or public transport. A short time ago the APA news agency reported an update from Austria\u2019s interior ministry, stating one attacker was \u201cdead\u201d and another \u201con the run\u201d, while one police officer was seriously injured. A second attacker has been arrested. The president of Vienna\u2019s Jewish community, Oskar Deutsch, said that shots had been fired \u201cin the immediate vicinity\u201d of the Stadttempel synagogue but added that it was currently unknown whether the synagogue itself had been the target of an attack. He said that the synagogue and office buildings at the same address had been closed at the time of the attack. \u201cIt sounded like firecrackers, then we realised it was shots,\u201d said one eyewitness quoted by ORF. Vienna police have urged people not to share video and photos via social media. \u201cThis jeopardises police forces as well as the civilian population,\u201d they said on Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
