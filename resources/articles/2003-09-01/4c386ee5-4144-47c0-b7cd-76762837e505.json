We had no idea what the boats would be like but were told that there was a toilet on board and that you could \"walk around\" so I naively imagined something a little more luxurious than the craft that met our eye in Chiang Khong. Our home for the next two days was a rough-looking, wooden vessel of shallow draught and uncertain age with a single, low-roofed deck covered with matting. There was a huge and noisy petrol engine aft and a tiny wheelhouse in the forward part. From Bangkok, we could have flown to Luang Prabang - but at that point I couldn't resist the idea of the slow boat. We embarked via the narrow, but thankfully short, gangplank, with a helping hand from the crew. The tin-clad roof was stacked with baggage - including one wheelchair - while the inside was soon chock-full of more bags and us Thai tourist \"falangs\", sitting packed like sardines anywhere a space could be found. The long boat flexed as she was piloted expertly between the hazards. The Mekong is a wide, swift river where the current eddies over barely submerged rocks and where whirlpools abound. Larger rock formations are strewn along the river's coffee-coloured length and the forest vegetation covers its banks from steep hillsides. High blue-green mountains recede into the distance. There are frequent sand banks along the way, with tiny plantations and the odd human footprint. Bamboo houses, sometimes in clusters, can be glimpsed among the forest. After a day on the hard deck, all were grateful when we stopped for the night at Pakbeng and there was a scurry for accommodation. Emma and I waited on the bank for the wheelchair to emerge from the pile of baggage being unlashed from the roof, but my rucksack was nowhere to be seen. Then we noticed a tiny boy standing in front of us with the bag on his back ready to carry it up the huge concrete slope which led to the town. Other boys were keen to help with my wheelchair and I arrived at the top being pushed by two or three of them. Naturally they wanted a tip and 5,000 kip (about 30p) each seemed to do the trick. The hotel, the only one with hot water, had just let its last room by the time we got there but (thanks to Emma's speedy action) we managed to get a ground floor room in the last guesthouse that wasn't miles up another hill. Our second day on the boat was much as the first, though the damp, misty weather was getting cooler and people were beginning to have had enough, longing to reach Luang Prabang. When we finally alighted there I almost panicked; there was a lot of sand to cross to get even to the foot of the vast concrete slope, or some very steep steps to climb. After a lot of grunting and swearing, and the assistance of two Swedish girls, Emma and I eventually made it to the town. Surrounded by mountains, Luang Prabang lies on the peninsula formed by the confluence of the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers. There are more than 30 thriving wats in and around this ancient royal capital and as many in ruins. The plethora of Buddhist monasteries spawns a multitude of monks who can be seen ambling around the place in bright orange robes. Most of them are teenagers doing a kind of spiritual national service - every male is meant to do about three months - but it's also one of the few routes to a decent education. The French colonial architecture and traditional Lao buildings bristle with the red, white and blue flag (which looks good on a T-shirt), paired in communist Laos with the hammer and sickle. Being a former French colony there's a definite \"Indochine\" feel about the place which, luckily, means they do a nice line in \"patisserie\" and you can't move for baguettes. Animals are everywhere; even in town chickens run about among the bikes, pecking at the roundels of rice paper and rice cakes as they dry in the sun, soliciting flustered shouts from their owners. After a few days the damp weather broke and we were able to see the place in its full sun-baked glory. Luang Prabang is most enchanting and I began to explore the city with Letittia, a young French student, who had been working for an NGO. She was helping the H'Mong hill tribe women towards getting fair trade for their exquisite hand-made goods; textiles, embroidery and silver jewellery. Myself being a wheelchair user, and an oddly-shaped Anglo-Saxon to boot, we attracted quite a few stares, increasingly so as we stepped away from the main streets; friendly but curious. I'm no stranger to the odd bit of curiosity, even in the UK, but this was of a different order and took a bit of getting used to. Whole groups of people staring blatantly, following for a bit and even calling their friends over so they wouldn't miss such a peculiar sight! Strangely enough this seemed to give licence to some of the falang tourists to do the same. Perhaps harder for my ego to take was the frequent query to Letittia from the locals (indicating my not-so-old self) \"Papa?\". Nothing to do but grin and bear it, we carried on to Letittia's favourite wat: Xiang Thong, nestled peacefully between the two rivers at the western edge of town. Friendly boy monks sat around and chatted to us as one of them worked away on a small wooden carving of the Buddha. A few days later a local tuktuk man took me to where \"lau lao\", the local firewater, was being made. Distilled from fermented rice mash its taste might best be described as \"should-be-illegal\". My driver, a former schoolteacher, was full of information and spoke excellent English. He lifted my wheelchair in and out of the vehicle whenever we stopped, helped to negotiate the rough ground and introduced me to the locals out in the villages. Fortunately for me the usual place where tourists are shown lau lao distillers was having a \"new moon\" break, so I was taken to a nearby H'Mong village where, I was told, few westerners ever visit and where they only made the stuff for their own use. As we arrived the first to notice us were the kids, then their mums and the old ladies (teeth red with betel nut). Finally the men emerged until we were surrounded by what seemed like the whole village. Local audience in tow, I was shown the rice mash fermenting and the various bits and pieces of the still, with a crash course in moonshining thrown in. After a while the head man came to sit down with us and we shared a hot drink made from some kind of boiled herbs. The driver translated that this stuff was good for the stomach. I hoped he was right as there was no way I could refuse. As we chatted away I persuaded some of the kids to have a go in my wheelchair. Something, I was told, none of the villagers had seen before. Whilst in Laos I hardly saw a local female, from the oldest grandma to the smallest of tots, who did not wear the traditional Lao wrapover skirt. The only exception was when Emma and I had an outing to the nearest of the H'Mong villages, where the young girls wore traditional tribal outfits; fuller skirts of dark blue and black with bright applied decoration, headgear strung with silver beads, cowrie shells and red pom poms. We were told that the girls had been preparing all year and that many of the H'Mong we saw had travelled for days on foot to get here for it was new year, the time for the annual H'Mong betrothal festival. The young men and girls stand in lines facing each other and throw a ball in a ceremonious game of catch with their favoured opposite number. How this leads to marriage is still a mystery to me but it seems to work for them. This all takes place over several days during a village fete-style affair. Apart from an extremely dangerous-looking, meccano-inspired carousel, the only amusements seemed to be a vast amount of burst-three-balloons-with-three-darts stalls. I thought I'd have a go and with luck, and my usual large army of spectators, managed to win a warm can of Sprite. Luang Prabang proved a hard place to leave. For a final excursion, we made the short ride to the Kwang Xi waterfall where there was rumoured to be a tiger. She roamed around downstream from the main cascade, where a series of lesser falls flowed into brilliant turquoise pools. It took Emma and I about an hour struggling together over streams, logs and very lumpy bits indeed. The 'chair would roll for a few metres then have to be hauled the next few as I crawled and hobbled. But all the effort - and Emma's broken, favourite flip-flops - was worth it for the eventual sight when we made it: the tiger, lying in its full feline magnificence, quiet and barely contained behind a wire fence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
