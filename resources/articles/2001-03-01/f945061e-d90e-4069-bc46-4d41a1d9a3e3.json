Foot and mouth disease has broken out at Stormont. The symptoms include politicians getting hot under the collar and making incoherent statements inducing blind, herd-like panic. Ministerial foot and mouth leaves them lashing out in all directions The worst manifestation has been Ministers condemning an ice hockey team for playing on despite the closure of other sports fixtures across Ulster. Agriculture Minister Brid Rogers and deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon deserve credit for standing up for democracy over the last 30 years. Like David Trimble and Michael McGimpsey, who also criticised the Belfast Giants, the SDLP ministerial duo deserve their place in the sun. Their reaction, however, to the Giants' determination to stick to their league programme has been irrational. Unlike rugby and soccer, the Giants play on ice rather than grass, inside a closed stadium. The team has urged supporters from rural areas to stay away until the crisis abates. Moreover, its stadium provides for foot and tyre washes in a bid to avoid infections. If the Ministers at Stormont applied their logic evenly then they should insist that shopping centres and retail chains also place washing facilities at their entrances. If they are really worried about the prospect of English and Scottish ice hockey fans descending on Ulster's shores, then they should be equally concerned about the amount of business travellers from Britain who arrive daily at Aldergrove and Belfast City Airport. Why stop with air traffic? The Ministers should ban ALL cross-border travel, thus, in the spirit of North/South co-operation, protecting farming in Northern Ireland and the Republic. The spat between the power-sharing executive in Belfast and the Giants draws attention to the over-the-top foot and mouth frenzy. But the row also casts a shadow over the most encouraging development in local sport since Ulster won the European rugby cup three years ago. The Giants' arrival has been an enormous success on the ice rink and off, attracting support from across the community. The prices may be exorbitant - a friend paid \u00a360 so he and his two sons could watch a game - but the atmosphere inside the stadium is almost unique to Northern Ireland. It must be one of the few places where kids, who might support Celtic or Rangers outside, can wear the same shirt and shout for the same team. As their club's slogan goes: 'In the land of the Giants everyone is equal.' I have never been to a Giants' game and the chances of doing so are remote. But those who attend matches suggest it is a good thing for Northern Ireland. The club's success - gates average 7,000 - is emblematic of potential new times for the Province, with common allegiances and shared loyalties. If you doubt the need for this then examine that other outbreak of the human form of foot and mouth over the last fortnight: the treatment of Neil Lennon at Windsor Park. The bigots who booed the Celtic player during the Northern Ireland/Norway 'friendly' have justified their sectarianism over the airwaves. One fool on Radio Ulster said they only booed Lennon because he supported the idea of a united Irish soccer team. Perhaps this idiot forgets that some of the most dyed-in-the-wool unionists, such as the DUP's Davy Tweed, played for an all Ireland rugby team. No one at Landsdowne Road ever booed Tweed for wearing the green jersey, even though he is opposed to a United Ireland. Tweed treated the Irish national anthem with respect and in turn was treated with courtesy by players, officials and fans. Faced with the choice of having to listen to sectarian scumbags at Windsor Park or enjoying a family-night at the Giants, most sane people would choose the latter. While we wait for soccer to boot out the bigots, Belfast and Northern Ireland need the Giants. Memo to Brid, Seamus, David and Michael: let the boys on the banks of the Lagan play on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
