Holloway's claims come a week after Luton boss Mike Newell talked about a widespread bung culture. The FA will address the issue as a matter of priority and will be contacting Holloway this morning. He will be asked to give evidence to investigators from the FA's compliance unit that he was offered money to push through a free transfer. \"We will be contacting Ian Holloway to request a meeting. We take these matters very seriously and our compliance department will thoroughly investigate any evidence of wrongdoing or breaches of regulation,\" said an FA spokesman. \"We would expect anyone who has evidence of any wrongdoing to come forward.\" As the transfer was an international one, it will almost certainly fall under Fifa's jurisdiction. The spokesman added: \"If necessary we will pass on any information to Fifa and other national associations.\" Holloway said: \"I thought I was getting a certain player on a free transfer. His agent then came back to me and said 'my fee is this amount and you will get that from it'. I went back to the board and said 'You must be joking'. I earn my money through my contract, not any other way. I've nothing to hide. There are agents out there with whacking great wheelbarrows who say, 'Fill that up with money'.\" Former Rangers chairman Nick Blackburn has backed up Holloway's claims. \"Ian called me and said the agent of the player we were interested in wanted \u00a350,000 - and Olly [Holloway] was going to get \u00a330,000 of it. We didn't think the player in question was worth \u00a350,000, never mind that amount for his agent. In the end we settled on a \u00a34,000 handling fee,\" said Blackburn. \"I heard stories all the time when I was chairman. I'm very disappointed the game has to endure this.\" Newell has already been quizzed by FA officials after revealing he had been offered cash by agents and club officials as an incentive to buy and sell players."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
