The top UN envoy for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, told the UN security council he hoped to start the complex process of bringing the Afghan parties together to form a broad-based government \"as early as humanly possible\". Earlier, the prime minister, Tony Blair, called for an urgent UN presence in Kabul to fill the \"power vacuum\" left by the Taliban. Northern Alliance troops captured Kabul this morning after Taliban forces slipped away overnight, relinquishing the Afghan capital without a fight. Following four days of swift advances, alliance troops moved into the city in trucks and jeeps loaded with weapons to be welcomed with cheers and singing from residents. There were signs that the Taliban were abandoning other urban centres, possibly to withdraw into the remote southern mountains to wage guerrilla war. Officials with the Northern Alliance's foreign ministry said they had also seized control of the eastern city of Jalalabad, but there has been no independent confirmation. In the Taliban's stronghold and spiritual home of Kandahar, which is 500km (310 miles) south west of Kabul, there were reports that 200 Taliban militiamen had mutinied. A Taliban official, Mullah Najibullah, said that anti-Taliban forces had seized part of the city's airport in fierce fighting but reports indicated the Taliban still control the city. In a radio address, the Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, said he was in Kandahar and urged his followers to organise and resist opposition troops, the Pakistan based Afghan Islamic Press reported. \"This is my order: that you should obey your commander,\" the agency quoted Mullah Omar as saying. He said those who desert the Taliban \"would be like a hen and die in some ditch.\" Alliance troops roamed Kabul throughout the day, hunting Taliban stragglers and their Arab, Pakistani and Chechen allies from Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida movement. At least 11 Pakistanis and Arabs fighting for the Taliban were reportedly killed amid UN fears that the alliance would exact a bloody revenge against their opponents. The US president, George Bush, had urged the opposition to stay out of the capital until a new, broad-based government could be formed to replace the Taliban. But Alliance officials said the unexpected Taliban evacuation made it necessary for them to enter the city to maintain public order. Confronted with the fait accompli of the fall of Kabul, US officials today hailed it as a breakthrough, but remained concerned that rebel forces entering the capital could prompt more fighting. Pakistan's military leader, General Pervez Musharraf, said Kabul should be demilitarised so \"the atrocities of the past\" are not repeated, and called for a UN peacekeeping mission drawn from Muslim nations to be deployed in the city. However the UN's envoy to Afghanistan, Mr Brahimi, ruled out a UN peacekeeping force, saying it would take months to get troop commitments from various nations and said peacekeepers were better at monitoring peace agreements already in place than ensuring security in unstable nations. Mr Brahimi said his first preference would be an all-Afghan security force, but he did not think it could be assembled quickly. He added that the best option is a multinational security force, though he did not offer further details. Witnesses said that the Taliban deserting Kabul took with them eight foreign aid workers, including two Americans accused of spreading Christianity in Muslim Afghanistan. A UN spokeswoman cited reports of summary executions in Mazar-i-Sharif, the northern city that was abandoned by the Taliban on Friday. More than 100 young Taliban recruits who were hiding in a school were reportedly killed by Northern Alliance forces, UN spokeswoman Stephanie Bunker said in Islamabad, Pakistan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
