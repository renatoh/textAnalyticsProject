Steven Parton, 40, and Karen Morris, 23, will serve at least 18 and 15 years respectively for what the judge called the \"obscene\" killing of Nelvaughn Brade, 22, at a house in Birmingham. Morris was convicted yesterday of murder. Parton, a former stripper, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing. Birmingham crown court had heard that Morris and Parton were in fear of their victim. They believed he was a member of a notorious gang. Brade was living with Parton when he was shot with a crossbow as he showered in the property on November last year. As he tried to escape, he was beaten to the floor with an axe. Morris is thought to have delivered the fatal blow by stabbing him in the neck. She and Parton then began butchering the body, cutting up organs, and passing his flesh through a mincer. The body parts were packed into two oil drums which the couple drove more than 100 miles to throw into a skip, which was later dumped on a tip near King's Lynn, Norfolk. But the couple were plunged into mental turmoil and on November 10 both tried to kill themselves. The next day they went to a police station where they confessed to the murder. A three-day search of the tip was carried out and three bin bags containing Mr Brade's organs, bones and limbs were found after Morris and Parton told detectives where to look. Julia Macur QC, prosecuting, said: \"The bin liners contained in one, the organs of Nelvaughn Brade - his stomach, his lungs, heart, kidneys and liver - in another, his ribcage and pelvis, and in another, head, his hands and a foot. Another bone that was found to have been part of Nelvaughn Brade's skeleton was found in a different part of the site, removed by animals.\" She added: \"The flesh had been removed almost completely from his skeleton. It had been minced through a domestic mincer. The flesh was found in two 25-gallon plastic oil drums.\" Ms Macur said expert analysis revealed the body had been dismembered \"proficiently\" and that skin on the palm of both hands and one foot had been removed \"cleanly and expertly\" to hinder identification. Various reasons were given in court as possible motives for the murder. Ms Macur said Mr Brade had been distributing cannabis Parton was growing and that the former stripper had become concerned his housemate was going to steal his 3,500 plants. Morris had had sex with Mr Brade on one occasion and he had allegedly bombarded her with phone calls when their relationship ended, threatening to stab or shoot her. Testifying for the prosecution, Nicholas Kennedy, a consultant psychiatrist, said Morris was \"extremely frightened\" of Mr Brade, whom she knew as \"Johnny\". But Dr Kennedy said both Morris and Parton were taking crack, which could have triggered their paranoia. Ms Macur said they had also formed the opinion that Mr Brade was intending to kidnap Parton's mother and hold her until the deeds to the house were passed over to him. He was said to have bragged to Parton that he was part of the north Birmingham gang known as the Burger Bar Boys and had once cut off someone's hand. The prosecutor alleged that the killers decided the only way to get rid of the lodger was to murder him and so they set about buying a crossbow, knives, an axe and a metal bar with which to dispose of him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
