The result is likely to produce a corker of a diplomatic headache for all concerned - and dramatically change the parameters of Middle East politics. Formally, both Washington and Brussels back Israel in considering Hamas a terrorist organisation, pointing to its commitment to armed struggle, including the use of suicide bombings that have killed hundreds of Israelis, and a refusal to recognise the Jewish state. As such it is proscribed and banned from receiving aid. In practice, the outcome of tomorrow's election, in which the Islamic Resistance Movement (to use its full name) is thought likely to win 30-40% of the vote, is going to require a subtle diplomatic response - especially as the US has been energetically, if selectively, promoting democracy in the Middle East since the Iraq war. Washington supported Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, in his decision to let Hamas run in this contest in the hope that it would be drawn away from violence into politics. The US also ensured that Israel did not sabotage the ballot. Assuming that the election does produce a good result for Hamas - and barring surprises that now seems certain - governments will have to think again - hard. Responses will depend, of course, on exactly what happens. If Hamas does well but remains in opposition to the Palestinian Authority - the quasi-government set up by Yasser Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah, and now run by Mr Abbas - that will be one thing, though its representatives, running under the banner of \"change and reform\", will have a popular mandate to oppose the corruption and chaos associated with the PA. But if it performs so well that the Fatah movement - the core of the PLO - is forced to form a coalition with it, the situation will be different. Preliminary signs are that whatever happens the US will choose to maintain its formal boycott of Hamas, though Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, has already alluded to the \"practical problem\" that will create. Both Americans and Europeans would certainly be hard-pressed to maintain ties with the Palestinian Authority while simultaneously avoiding contact with a banned terrorist group. And amongst Europeans, with their long experience of informal or back-channel contacts with groups such as the IRA and the Basque group Eta, there are already signs of a more flexible approach. It has also been tried before. In 2002, EU governments authorised the mission of Alastair Crooke, a former British intelligence officer, who liaised discreetly with Hamas and Islamic Jihad until he was ordered to sever contacts in the wake of renewed violence at one of the bloodiest stages of the second intifada. And there was an unmistakable signal this week from Miguel Angel Moratinos, the Spanish foreign minister, who has rich experience of the region from his long service as the EU's special Middle East envoy. \"If Palestinian society decides that this organisation must be represented in parliament, we will see what the political landscape looks like and then draw our conclusions,\" he said. Intriguingly, Hamas has also been giving hints about its intentions. The most important was its decision to take part in this poll. It boycotted the first elections to the Palestinian Authority in 1996 because of its principled opposition to the Oslo accords that made them possible. Its election manifesto does not repeat the call of its founding charter for the destruction of Israel, though it does reaffirm Hamas's commitment to \"armed resistance to end occupation\". Campaigners have been proudly displaying pictures of Hamas \"martyrs\", including those who carried out nearly 60 suicide attacks on Israel, and of the movement's revered founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. He was killed, in his wheelchair, in an Israeli \"targeted assassination\" in 2004. And as Israeli government spokesmen are quick to point out, the ideology of Hamas remains resolutely fundamentalist, its goal the establishment of an Islamic state \"over every inch of Palestine\", even if it is prepared to be pragmatic in the short term, focus on urgent social and economic issues and leave the realisation of its grand vision for future generations. Israel's official position is that whatever the election result, it will continue to boycott Hamas and hopes others will too - though some security officials, impressed by the group's discipline and ability to maintain its ceasefire, have indicated that a discreet dialogue is a good idea. But plenty of foreigners, inside and outside government, will be offering their own advice. The International Crisis Group argues persuasively in a report published to coincide with the election that it makes sense to encourage Hamas to move onto a political track and that marginalisation will only push it towards greater violence. The ICG calls for \"gradual, conditional engagement\" with Hamas. \"There is every reason for the West to withold formal dealings at a national level, at least until it renounces attacks against civilians and drops its opposition to a two-state solution,\" the thinktank says. \"But the current confused approach - boycotting Hamas while facilitating its electoral participation; facilitating its participation without seeking through some engagement reciprocal concessions - makes no sense at all.\" Further complicating the picture, a good result for Hamas is likely to have a negative impact on March's general election in Israel, already overshadowed by uncertainty since the demise of Ariel Sharon and his replacement as leader of the new centrist Kadima party by the less experienced Ehud Olmert. Hamas militants have carved out real legitimacy in Palestinian politics. They have yet to win over their enemies in Israel. And unless that happens, not much will really change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
