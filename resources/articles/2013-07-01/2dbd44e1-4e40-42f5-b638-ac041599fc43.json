Murray's four-set victory over Janowicz was mired in controversy after the conclusion of the third set, when the tournament referee, Andrew Jarrett, opted to close the roof at 8.39pm because of bad light. Janowicz had been complaining about the poor light for some time but Murray was outraged with the decision, saying to Jarrett: \"You can't close it now, man. It's light until 9.30. He's been complaining about it for the last 40 minutes \u2013 ridiculous, it's not even dark.\" After his victory, which sets up a final against Novak Djokovic on Sunday, Murray said: \"There's probably 45 minutes of light left and I like to think this is an outdoor event and you try to play as much outdoors as you can. Obviously at that period I had just won five games in a row and I managed to regain my focus. We had 20 minutes off the court, I took a shower, spoke to the guys a little bit and got back to work.\" The All England Club made the decision as it felt the light would fade significantly during the course of the fourth set, which lasted 35 minutes. Murray admitted that his emotions after securing the win were different from when he triumphed in the semi-finals last year and that he hopes he will be mentally stronger when facing Djokovic on Sunday than when he met Roger Federer a year ago. \"I think I'll probably be in a better place mentally,\" he said. \"I would hope so just because I've been there before. I won a grand slam, I would hope I would be a little bit calmer. We [he and Djokovic] have a professional friendship now. When we were younger it was more friendly; whereas now, you know, I still message him sometimes. But I don't think it goes more than that. It's just hard because playing in big, big matches with a lot on the line, you can't be best of friends when that's happening.\" Asked what he thought Fred Perry, Britain's last winner of the men's singles at Wimbledon in 1936, would say to him if he had the chance, Murray replied: \"Why are you not wearing my kit?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
