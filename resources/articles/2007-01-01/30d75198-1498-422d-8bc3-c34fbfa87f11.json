Drain the petrol (it will work in the car), clean the innards with a stiff brush and sharpen the blades; this is simplest with a drill attachment (try the rotary mower and tool sharpener, \u00a36, from Harrod Horticultural, 0845 402 5300, harrodhorticultural.com). Change the oil, then start the engine. If it doesn't start, take it to the mower repair shop now - if you wait until the grass starts growing, you're likely to find yourself at the end of a very long queue. Ways with sprouts Sprouted seeds are quick, easy and nutritious, and jazz up a salad while fresh supplies are low. Invest in a fancy sprouter if you want lots of different sprouts in a limited space, or use trays in an unheated propagator. Soak seeds for eight hours, rinse and drain every 12 hours until they germinate, then refrigerate or eat. An array of seeds and sprouters can be found at Suffolk Herbs (01376 572456, suffolkherbs.com). Plant it now Winter gardening need not be all about future glories. This is the time to plant a tree for winter interest, and you would be hard pressed to beat the Tibetan cherry, Prunus serrula. It has shiny, copper-red bark that peels away as it ages, revealing layers of ever-shinier bark beneath. In spring it has small white blossom. Grow in sun in any soil. Readers can order one bare-root tree for \u00a324.95, or two for \u00a339.90. Call 0870 836 0908, quoting reference GUPW68. Price includes UK mainland p&amp;p. Delivery within 28 days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
