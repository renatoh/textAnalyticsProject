The brief flowering of the UK alt.country movement a few years back proved there was nothing hokey about British bands adopting American forms, but the best of those bands were adapting as well as adopting, whereas Phantom Limb don't sound as if they have brought much of Bristol to the stew. In fact, the most British ingredient is the strong flavour of Rod Stewart's Mercury albums \u2013 organ and acoustic guitar are dominant flavours; occasionally the bass carries a little melodic flourish \u2013 but there's nothing to rival Mandolin Wind. It's always pleasant \u2013 in fact, the title track starts off as if they're trying to throw a little Rumer into the mix as well \u2013 but never quite manages to step beyond that, even as they bemoan the fate of \"old Missy, living her life in vain\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
