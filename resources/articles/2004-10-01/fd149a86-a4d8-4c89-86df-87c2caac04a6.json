Liverpool's visit to Millwall on Tuesday evening and Chelsea's first meeting with West Ham for 18 months were always going to be high-risk games and attractive to those supporters who, despite the advances of recent seasons, are still intent on trouble. The Metropolitan police, having classified both matches as category C confrontations and boosted their numbers accordingly, did not expect either match to pass off without incident. They were not wrong, as first the Den and then Stamford Bridge saw police clashing with away supporters who were trying to get at their rivals. Four arrests were made on Tuesday as Liverpool supporters surged towards the home fans in reaction to alleged taunts about the Hillsborough disaster, knocking over a disabled supporter in a wheelchair as they did so. On Wednesday night 16 were held after West Ham fans reacted to being showered with missiles by Chelsea supporters, but not before the home team's centre-forward Mateja Kezman was hit by a bottle thrown from the away section. A steward was taken to hospital after being butted and arrests were made for GBH, violent disorder, affray and possession of an offensive weapon. What marked these incidents as unusual was that unlike most football-related violence they occurred inside the grounds. The evidence of recent seasons is that although football-related disorder is slowly declining - Home Office figures released last week revealed a 10% decline in arrests last season - a minority of the game's followers still engage in violence. By and large it takes place away from matches, largely because of the increasingly effective use of CCTV inside grounds. Last season 85% of arrests for violent disorder and 57% of all arrests were made outside grounds. CCTV will be the most potent tool for the police as they seek to track down, charge and then pursue banning orders against those accused of abusive chanting and the ripping out of more than 60 seats at Millwall. Yesterday, confronted by claims that the coincidence of two nights of very public violence constituted a return to the bad old days, the authorities stressed that these were not aberrations but rather proof of their abiding message on hooliganism: the problem has not gone away. \"The events of the last two evenings prove that, while hooliganism has been marginalised, it is still an issue for football,\" said the Home Office. \"The context is that the game is largely peaceful these days but clearly there is still a minority interested in trouble.\" The Home Office spokesman rejected any suggestion that the violence was evidence of a trend towards \"midweek hooliganism\". Both games were Coca-Cola Cup matches, in which a higher proportion of tickets are sold on the night, more away fans can get in than for league matches, and the calming presence of families and regular ticket holders is often missing. \"There's no evidence to suggest that cup matches attract a higher level of violence. The risk factor attached to games varies depending on who is playing more than what the competition is. Both these matches were rare meetings between teams, and the trouble stands out because it was in the grounds,\" the spokesman said. The Football Association, which has launched investigations into the incidents, echoed the Home Office's view that the lesson of this week's trouble is that football can ill-afford to be complacent about violence. \"This week's clashes were extremely regrettable especially as so much good work has been achieved to reduce violence and antisocial behaviour in and around English stadiums,\" said a spokesman. \"Thankfully such incidents have become very rare over the last decade and receive large-scale coverage on the rare occasions on which they occur. \"There are no grounds for complacency and there is still work to be done. English football, in conjunction with the police and supporters, will do all it can to prevent the antisocial behaviour of a tiny minority damaging our game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
