Demonstrators gathered in Trafalgar Square from 4pm on Tuesday, with NHS workers slated to lead them down the Mall towards Buckingham Palace, where the US president was due to meet the Queen and Boris Johnson at a reception for Nato heads of government. Sonia Adesara, a junior doctor and organiser of the NHS block that was to lead the demonstration, had started a petition calling on the government to keep the health service out of any post-Brexit trade deals. It has so far drawn more than a million signatures. \u201cThe ideology of what Trump represents is everything that the NHS is not,\u201d Adesara said before the demonstration began. \u201cThe NHS is about universalism, we care for everyone regardless of where they are from. Everyone is treated the same. Trump epitomises the complete opposite of that. That\u2019s why NHS workers [are] protesting today.\u201d The protest was called by a coalition of groups, including NHS workers, the Stop Trump Coalition, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Stop the War Coalition and Stand Up to Racism. At a rally in Trafalgar Square speeches were given by Adesara, the writer Tariq Ali, and American activist Medea Benjamin, before protesters headed off on the march. In the event, Kurdish groups took the front of the march, chanting their opposition to the invasion of northern Syria by Turkey, a Nato member. Police charged one group of protesters on the Mall after they tried to take down the Turkish flag, among the flags of Nato members raised for the summit. Among those marching in solidarity with Syria\u2019s Kurds was Ronak Yones, 60. She said: \u201cYesterday 10 children were killed in Rojava by an airstrike [when a] bomb hit their school.\u201d She said Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Erdo\u011fan, was mobilising Islamist militias as his proxies in his war on the Kurds. \u201cNato means Erdo\u011fan, Erdo\u011fan means Isis,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world needs to know they are connected.\u201d Police initially held the march back on the Mall but eventually people were permitted to go along the intended route of Canada Gate, opposite the palace. Later demonstrators were expected to return to Trafalgar Square for a party staged by R3 Soundsystem, to include music from DJs including A Guy Called Gerald, Midland, Normski and Homobloc. A spokesperson for R3 Soundsystem said: \u201cAs the alliance between Donald Trump, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage emerges, it is imperative that we call out this coordinated assault on the core values of this country and call out these men for what they really stand for. We will never allow haters, liars and racists to go unchallenged here in the UK. Music is our chosen weapon in this fight, and love is the message.\u201d Lindsey German, national convenor for the Stop the War, said: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s aim is more spending on the military which means less on the NHS and schools. Nato expansion has been immensely costly in terms of finance and is growing tension across the world. It must stop now. Trump must go.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
