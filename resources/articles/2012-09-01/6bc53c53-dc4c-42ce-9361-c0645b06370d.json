Thousands queued around the car park under which the skeleton was found, before the hole is filled in this week and the cars return. The archeologists and geneticists of Leicester University are containing their excitement about the find, which would originally have been under a tomb in the choir of a monastery. Much can still go wrong in a search that the dig director Richard Buckley compared to playing battleships. But already the discovery of the skeleton has given a boost to The Richard III Society, which blames the \"infamous\" Tudors for rewriting history and Shakespeare for immortalising it. Richard III's revival \u2013 he achieved much in the one-and-a-half peaceful years of his reign \u2013 could well follow his reburial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
