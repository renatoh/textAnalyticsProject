In his first interview since he was freed last Thursday, Mr Kember, 74, from Pinner, north-west London, told the Baptist Times his captors had allowed him and two Canadian hostages writing pads and exercise. He also got the medicine he needed for his high blood pressure. Mr Kember, a volunteer for the Christian Peacemaker Teams group, said he had struggled with the language barrier between him and the Arabic-speaking kidnappers who showed him the film, which was in Arabic. The contents of the DVD, said Jonathan Bartley, a CPT spokesman, suggested the kidnapping had not been religiously motivated. Mr Kember's account seems more upbeat than that of fellow hostage James Loney, 41, who described his ordeal as \"terrifying\" on his return to Canada. \"For 118 days I disappeared into a black hole and somehow, by God's grace, I was spat out again,\" he said. While Mr Kember was held in Baghdad, his US colleague, Tom Fox, was shot dead after what security sources believed was a rift between two groups of kidnappers. The previously unknown Swords of Righteousness Brigades claimed responsibility for the kidnappings. Mr Kember said he appreciated the support shown by the Muslim community, which Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, said could have \"contributed\" to his release. He also reiterated his tribute to the SAS team who helped rescue him. Mark Woods, editor of the Baptist Times, said: \"The Baptist denomination has been very loyal to Norman and to Pat, his wife, and as far as possible he wanted to thank them personally. He is a very respected member of our community, and we're delighted that he is safely home.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
