Williams, who will link up with Bolt's mentor, Glen Mills, in Jamaica in October, narrowly missed out on qualifying for Team GB for the Olympics after suffering an injury before the trials. The hotly tipped 19-year-old holds dual citizenship for Turks &amp; Caicos and Great Britain and was previously eligible to compete for the British team at the Games due to the island's status as an overseas territory. He has now decided to compete full time for Great Britain in all international competitions and his immediate transfer has been granted by the International Association of Athletics Federations. \"I am very pleased that my transfer of allegiance has been confirmed and I am excited to be aiming towards a British team this summer,\" he said. \"Any athlete who saw the Olympics would feel an affinity with British fans as they showed how much they love the sport. I hope to receive a similar warm welcome in a British vest this season.\" UK Athletics' performance director, Neil Black, said the decision showed \"exactly the right commitment\". He added: \"We very much look forward to working with him as he develops into a senior athlete. He is already a real talent and he will be vying for selection to the team for the Moscow world championships when he competes at the British Championships in Birmingham in July.\" The decision was also welcomed by Edith Skippings, president of the Turks &amp; Caicos athletics association. \"The good thing about all of this is that we are a part of the UK and we look for forward to continuous dialogue and collaboration,\" she said. \"The outcome of Delano's transfer should be seen by the people of the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands as a positive move and one that is inspiring and uplifting to our talented athletes who have the same dreams and aspirations as Delano.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
