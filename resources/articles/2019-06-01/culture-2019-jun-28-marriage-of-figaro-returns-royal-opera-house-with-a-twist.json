The role is almost always played by a mezzo-soprano or soprano passing themselves off as a man, but the Korean-American countertenor Kangmin Justin Kim will make Covent Garden history when he takes up the part in David McVicar\u2019s revived production. Sir John Eliot Gardiner, who will conduct and argued for Kim to play Cherubino, said the current debates over gender politics gave the casting an interesting topicality. \u201cI think this is a rather intriguing turning point,\u201d he said. \u201cJustin Kim is a remarkable singer and a remarkable actor too. I call him a male soprano \u2026 he has got an extraordinary top to his voice and he is very masculine.\u201d Gardiner said it was interesting to cast a man in a role steeped in gender fluidity \u2013 the woman playing the boy is disguised as a girl before reverting to being a boy. \u201cHere you\u2019ve got a double take on that which gives it an extra depth. He does it so convincingly I find it a really enchanting twist on Mozart\u2019s opera. \u201cThere is no political statement, nobody is trying to pretend this is authentic. Mozart did not cast Cherubino as a boy \u2026 but I think Mozart would have been intensely amused and would smile and have a really good chortle at the idea of Justin singing Cherubino.\u201d Kim, who is making his Covent Garden debut, has played the role previously, something he described as \u201ca very good entry-level experience\u201d for getting to know the character. \u201cIt is a great honour and I\u2019m very humbled by being able to bring this character to life as a man and perhaps show a side of Cherubino which people don\u2019t often get to see \u2026 like the more masculine side which is not necessarily fabricated, it\u2019s actually driven by testosterone.\u201d Cherubino is one of opera\u2019s most famous \u201ctrouser roles\u201d, a young male character played by a woman whose voice could convey youthful exuberance. In recent years there has been a trend towards countertenors being cast in the roles \u2013 a joy for Kim, who remembers auditioning for opera courses about seven years ago and being told he should not have them in his repertoire. \u201cI had many people tell me that my repertoire choices were completely wrong because these roles were not being cast with men. That just because I can sing it, it doesn\u2019t mean I should have it in my repertoire. Those were the exact words given to me. Since then I\u2019ve sung four of them on stage.\u201d Kim, who grew up in Chicago, said performing at Covent Garden was a dream and that opportunities for countertenors had come a long way. \u201cThe possibilities are endless and I\u2019m very lucky to be living in a time when people are willing to see a male singer singing Cherubino.\u201d McVicar\u2019s much-loved The Marriage of Figaro is getting its sixth revival since its premiere at Covent Garden in 2006 with a cast including Christian Gerhaher as Figaro, Jo\u00e9lle Harvey as Susanna, Simon Keenlyside as Count Almaviva and Julia Kleiter as Countess Almaviva, the object of Cherubino\u2019s infatuation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
