He was only 38, but his place in the performing history of his instrument was assured: he had not only recorded the complete keyboard works of both Rameau and Couperin, but also the first ever complete survey of Domenico Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas. There are 555 of them, and Ross recorded all of them in a series of 98 sessions in a variety of locations spread over a year for Radio France, which broadcast his performances throughout the Scarlatti tercentenary in 1985. They appeared as one boxed set on the Erato label at the beginning of the 1990s, but at full price the cost (more than \u00a3400) was then prohibitive for most collectors. Reissued now by Warner Classics, in a budget set, the whole magnificent undertaking gains a new lease of life, and Ross's recordings seem certain to be recognised for what they are: one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of recording. It goes without saying that Ross's playing is a model of stylish musicianship, at the same time elegant and rhythmically disciplined. It may be less expressively freewheeling than some more recent performers, but it still conveys a wonderful sense of freedom, and an instinctive response to the shape and purpose of every phrase. Recording projects on this kind of scale can seem dutiful rather than inspired, but wherever you dip into these discs there is a feeling of sheer pleasure, a delight in the exuberant invention of these pieces. Scarlatti's handful of sonatas for keyboard and other instruments are included (played by violinist Monica Huggett and cellist Christophe Coin among others), and the whole set is superbly documented, with notes on each of the sonatas, a glossary and an introductory interview with Ross. Strangely, though, there are no details of the instrument (or instruments) on which they were recorded. It hardly matters - this set is an incredible treat and genuinely life-enhancing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
