This is showbiz stripped down to its bare bones. There's no raked seating. The lighting rig is rudimentary, to say the least. The performance area is simply marked with gaffer tape, there are no props or costumes. And, as usual, there's no script. Yet within minutes, Crunchy Frog transform this tiny venue into an everywhere. George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh and Enid Blyton collide in one schizophrenic skit. A brief encounter between a prostitute and her punter is pure Harold Pinter, and the verse drama that follows recalls the exuberant Shakespearean forays of Not Only But Also or Beyond The Fringe. Of course, nobody acquires this sort of casual expertise overnight, and it's no surprise that Crunchy Frog's core players have been doing improvisational comedy for ages. Whelans has improvised across the US and Canada (improv's spiritual home) including Montreal's famous international comedy festival, Just For Laughs. And the credentials of Whelan's Canuck colleague, Alan Marriott, are no less impressive; he trained with Keith Johnston - the man who made improv what it is today. Johnston went to Montreal in the 1970s and founded Theatresports, the troupe which provided the basic template for modern improv. \"I was fortunate to be there in the very early stages,\" says Marriott, as tonight's happy audience shuffles back downstairs. \"Keith started Theatresports in Calgary in 1977, and I got started with them in Vancouver in 1980. The whole movement was very, very young at that time\" he remembers. He has since created improvised operas and musicals and coached Eddie Izzard and Alan Davies, whose distinct yet equally imaginative styles bear all the marks of Marriott's training. Improv, it seems, is everywhere today. There may not have been a dedicated TV show since Whose Line is it Anyway?, but while Have I Got News for You? and Never Mind the Buzzcocks pretend they're panel games, the questions are irrelevant and no one cares who wins. They're improv in disguise. And it's not just gameshows that have been infected. As audiences tire of old-time light entertainment and traditional formats unravel, the performers topping the ratings are the ones who can ditch the autocue and think on their feet. Graham Norton is more improv comic than conventional chat show host. Buzzcocks captain Bill Bailey works on the hoof, too, and although Paul Merton is a successful stand-up, his flights of fancy on Have I Got News For You? always feel far closer to his spontaneous riffs with top improv troupe, the Comedy Store Players. It's difficult to overstate the influence of the Comedy Store's resident team. Merton was a founder member - as was Austin Powers himself, Mike Myers - while over the years, the Players have featured many of the most familiar faces on TV - Rory Bremner, Julian Clary, Caroline Quentin and Tony Slattery to name but four - plus political comics such as Jeremy Hardy and Mark Steel. Merton summed up the show's - and the format's - appeal on the South Bank Show a few years ago. \"You sit in a room trying to convince a commissioning editor that a joke's a funny joke and he can't get it. And then you go to the Comedy Store and you think of something off the top of your head and you do it and the audience roar with laughter.\" Johnston's brand of improv has spread as far afield as Australia and New Zealand, and it isn't just for professional performers. His protege, Marriott, also uses improvisation as a form of corporate training, teaching companies creativity, teamwork, lateral thinking and conflict resolution. Doctors and trades unions are also among his clients, while he says two of the best improvisers he has ever worked with were a social worker and a postman. His weekly classes are attended by people from all walks of life who find all sorts of vocational and personal benefits in improv, irrespective of whether they end up doing it in front of paying punters. \"This really is a cooperative form,\" he says. \"Stand-up works with competition but improv doesn't.\" If there's anything in your life that requires cooperation, improv can help you do it, he says. \"It trains you to do a lot of different things. Many, many good improvisers end up being writers.\" Or maybe even better social workers and postmen. Despite introducing improvisational comedy to a wider audience, Whose Line... was something of a mixed blessing. \"It actually did live improv no favours at all,\" says Marriott. \"Everything had to be short. Everything was about gags. It wasn't about what improv does best, which is to build stories and scenes.\" But now the TV circus has moved on, improv is getting back to basics, and in a small yet significant way, Grand Theft Impro is at the forefront of its revival. \"There is something funny about the notion that you troupe out onstage and an audience pays money to sit and watch you make it up,\" Whelans concedes. And its especially funny when it's made up by the Crunchy Frog Collective. \u00b7 Grand Theft Impro is at the Crown, 64 Brewer Street, London W1 at 8.30pm every Thursday until 18 December.
