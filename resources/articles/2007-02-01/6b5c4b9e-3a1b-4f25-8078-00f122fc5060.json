Those who defend animal research in the UK have consistently sought to avoid having a full, open and honest discussion about their controversial methodology, despite persistent efforts by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection and others to do so via all legal means, including freedom of information requests. The truth is, many scientists question the basis of using animals in research, as highlighted in a recent research paper published in the British Medical Journal, which pointed to examples of dangerous consequences for human health. Sadly, neither their views nor those of the millions of ordinary people in the UK who oppose experiments on animals on moral grounds, were represented in an article ostensibly on being open about research. The vast majority of scientists, academics, theologians and others who want to see an end to animal research have been waiting patiently for researchers to come out and have a level, rational debate. It is therefore disappointing and unfortunate that the bodies that represent them insist on highlighting the activities of one or two isolated extremists, rather than engaging in a true debate with those that represent the millions who peacefully oppose animal testing. Perhaps it is the fear of losing the argument that prevents them from doing so. Michelle Thew , chief executive, British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection London \u00b7 I can see why people don't like experiments on animals. There is always the suspicion that some of it is more about profit than medical advancement. Nevertheless, I support the need for such experiments and am concerned at the irrational views of a hard core who seem far more concerned about this than, for example, the war in Iraq, where many humans have died without good cause. I am equally concerned about those - quite a small group also, I suspect - who demonstrate in support of tests. Experiments would be better done away from the glare of publicity on either side. Keith Flett London Selective truths Nigel Probert (Letters, February 13) appears to misunderstand Peter Mortimore's excellent article (Opinion, February 6). Professor Mortimore's well argued point was precisely that high standards \"at the top\" do not need to be sacrificed in order to raise the standards of the great majority. There are 15 local authorities that have retained selective schooling systems since the 1950s. Overall standards in these areas ought to be much better than in areas such as Staffordshire and Cheshire, both blighted with comprehensives for decades. It would surely be unthinkable for seven out of 10 of England's worst-performing schools to be in areas that have retained selection, or that the two authorities that make the most appearances in the list of 100 worst-performing schools should be Lincolnshire and Kent, both selective. The truth is that, while selective systems appeal to ingrained British snobbery, it is comprehensive systems that have greater potential for raising standards. It is unfortunate that no government has had the courage to recognise this. Michael Pyke , NEC member, Campaign for State Education Shenstone, Staffs Riches in rag trade It is good to see that Mulberry is doing apprenticeships in the manufacture of clothes (A stitch in time, February 13). This takes me back to 1939, when I started my apprenticeship with Debenham &amp; Freebody, who took in youngsters to teach them the trade. We started with making shoulder pads, and had to do a lot of carrying the garments from one place to another till we were allowed to actually work on them. Many years later, I have never regretted having learned the hard way to sew and am glad I can help my grandchildren with real dressmaking. Two girls are now doing textiles at college.
