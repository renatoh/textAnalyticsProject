San Francisco", "bodyText": "Why? It may sound like a clich\u00e9, but it really does have everything. I've only been there for six days so far, but I enjoyed myself so much I am keen to go again. I'd even consider living there. The clubs and bars are good and the people are really friendly and easy-going. It's a clean city, and I found the climate especially pleasant. It wasn't too hot and muggy, like it is down the coast in Los Angeles. The best thing? Getting out into the country around the city, like the redwood forest and the mountains. The sea there is excellent for wind-surfing. You can even go skiing just a few hours away. My ideal day: I'd head out over the Golden Gate Bridge to the beach for the day, where I'd surf until 3pm or 4pm. Then I'd head back for dinner somewhere around Union Square. I'd probably round the night off with a few beers in a bar or club. My advice: Try to get out and walk around San Francisco, it is one of the few American cities where you still can. If possible, explore outside the city, too. I'm told that a day in the Napa Valley wine region is memorable. Getting there: Virgin Atlantic (01293 450150, Virgin Atlantic) flies between London Heathrow and San Francisco from around \u00a3340 return. Where was your best holiday? The north-west coast of Spain on a month-long driving holiday. It was really quiet and not at all touristy, and all the beaches were very clean. What is the best hotel you have stayed in? I can't recall its name, but it was an apartment-like motel in Orlando that was like a full-on five-star hotel. Where do you want to go next? South America. I'd like to go to Guatemala as well as explore Mexico and Brazil. What do you never travel without? My mobile phone and a toothbrush. \u00b7 Rower Rick Dunn is one of the Great Britain coxless four team, currently in Austria training for the World Championships to be held in Seville, September 15-22."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
