There had been many pit closures prior to the strike, but all via negotiation. The miners' union conference had resolved that no pit could be closed without negotiation; if steps were taken to close without agreement the union executive had a mandate to call a strike without a ballot. The NCB ordered the closure of Cortonwood colliery without consultation \u2013 and that was why the strike was triggered in the summer, the worst time to call a fuel strike. Dave Nicholson Windsor, Berkshire \u2022\u2008Tariq Ali (There's only one Imran, 31 August) beggars belief with his claim that \"for the first time ever I was forced to buy the News of the World\" \u2013 to read about the Pakistan cricket match-fixing story. In 1972 he and I were the subjects of a News of the World expos\u00e9. Did he really not buy the newspaper then to find out what it had to say about his sinister activities? Martin Yarnit Whitbourne, Worcestershire \u2022\u2008Martin Kelner (Screen break, Sport, 30 August): \"Is there any other activity \u2026 apart from scoring a goal in a football match that is said to be performed with aplomb?\" David Stubbs (Watch this, G2, 31 August): \"Watching the aplomb with which he wields a whisk \u2026\" Mike Hine Kingston upon Thames \u2022\u2008Robin Flood (Letters, 30 August) writes about \"the ignoramus who addresses his hosts in Castilliano [sic]\". Does he mean \"Castilian\" (English) or \"castellano\" (Spanish)? And is he referring to hosts in Catalonia (English) or Catalunya (Catalan), rather than the \"Catalunia\" he coins? Keith Chambers Basingstoke, Hampshire \u2022\u2008I was shocked at Sister Gillian Price's use of the phrase \"taking the p***s\" (Letters, 1 September). I then felt relieved on realising her unfamiliarity with the correct spelling. It should clearly be \"p**s\". Steve Glass Ulverston, Cumbria \u2022\u2008Come along, chaps. This just won't do. All these images of \"crisp\" packets (Crunch time, G2, 1 September) and not a single pack of Seabrook's in sight.
