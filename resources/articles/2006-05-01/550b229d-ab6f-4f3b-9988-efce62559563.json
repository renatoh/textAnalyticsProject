It's hardly a trail-blazing move, given that millions of people, including thousands of journalists, have already created their own blogs. But in the world of instant and continuous communications it is just not tenable to stand back and watch from the sidelines. I've got the message about the medium that really counts, and it tells me that the computer screen is the future. To update Monsieur Descartes' maxim from the age of reason to the age of digitisation: blogito ergo sum. Blogging is the present and the future. It may be anarchic. It may lack style. Wordsmiths who carefully polish their sentences until they shine probably find it utterly distasteful. But blogging also empowers. It allows everyone to have a voice. To many journalists, especially editors, this is anathema. How dare the great unwashed usurp the customary right of the professional journalist to decide what should, and should not, be reported? We are on our way to the demise of top-down journalism in favour of bottom-up journalism, and the journey is proving rather uncomfortable. Even if the road were smoother it would require better signposts, and that's where I come in. My blog is going to be more about telling people where to go rather than what to think. I aim to provide a daily guide to news about the press in order that journalists, academics and the wider media community - indeed, everyone and anyone - can discover the most important media stories to be found online. My intention is to cover the globe and to be as comprehensive as possible, offering links to stories that will range from business matters to ethical debates, and from newspaper launches to press freedom concerns. Alongside the international and national material will be stories from Britain's regional and local papers, offering a chance to highlight the work of the thousands of journalists across the country whose campaigns and scoops get far too little coverage. One evening paper editor has already suggested that I could lead a campaign by linking up editors too. See the blog as a resource. In the argot of the internet it is an aggregator. But there will be just a little bit of aggravation too. I want to start debates as well as point to them. So log on soon through www.mediatheguardian.com and let's blog together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
