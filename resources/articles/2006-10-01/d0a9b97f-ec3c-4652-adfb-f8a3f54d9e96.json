While the focus was understandably on David Healy's hat-trick against Spain and Lawrie Sanchez's immediate future, another Northern Ireland story was noisily overshadowed. However, all who witnessed the international debut of the right-footed Jonny Evans at left-back that night will recall that, aged 18, and yet to make his full debut for Manchester United, Evans faced Fernando Torres and won. Torres could be forgiven for not seeing Evans coming; few did. The Belfast teenager featured in United's pre-season friendly at Celtic, and scored, but on the way to the game Evans was informed by Sir Alex Ferguson that until January he would be on loan at United's feeder club in Belgium, Royal Antwerp. Although sent off in each of his last two matches, unfairly he said, presumably Evans is growing up fast there because his display against Spain was notable for its maturity, even if Evans was self-critical. Two days before encountering Spain's forward line of Torres, Raul and David Villa, Evans was part of Northern Ireland's Under-21 squad. Then came the call-up and, as Evans explained yesterday: \"Lawrie called me over and said: 'How do you feel about left back?' I said: 'Yeah, I'll play anywhere, especially to get my first cap.' He said: 'Well, you're playing tonight.' It didn't really sink in, then I phoned my mum and dad. That was the first time I'd ever played full-back - ever.\" From Belfast's Rathcoole estate, which is rarely called quaint, Evans is a centre-half who first made the journey to Old Trafford aged nine. He clearly impressed from day one, so much so that when he was 15, in order to get around the rules about academies recruiting only from inside a certain geographical distance, Evans was moved to Manchester by the club. Six months later his family followed, including Jonny's younger brother Corry, now a promising midfielder with United's Under-16s. \"I felt a bit of anxiety about it all when I first went over but my father Jackie was at Chelsea when he was 16 and lived in London for a couple of years,\" Evans said. \"Then he went to Arsenal and then on to Barnet where he played under Barry Fry for a while. He was a right-back. So he had a bit of experience of going across and he told me about it. There wasn't anything that new, it's just I had to do it myself. \"I took it all in, didn't feel overawed. It was a learning experience just mixing in. That helped me to be able to integrate when I come to a new group such as when I came in here last month, it gives you the confidence to go in and introduce yourself.\" Evans's introduction was such that the Northern Ireland captain, Aaron Hughes, said yesterday: \"I think that's the last time he'll play in the under-21s. I can't remember a debut as good as that. He'd only been in the squad two days but came in and handled it easily. He's got every chance of making it, he might not even need a bit of luck.\" Making it at Old Trafford is the aim. Evans said that all his family, as he is, are United fanatics and that while \"there were a lot of clubs interested me, I only wanted to play for one club.\" He first met Ferguson when he was 10 - \"I've still got the photos in the house\" - and he made his one and only visit to Ferguson's office last season before the Youth Cup campaign. \"We had a manager last year, Paul McGuinness, son of Wilf McGuinness, and he went through a lot of the history of it all with us, how important the Youth Cup is to the club. But it was nice to see Alex Ferguson personally and hear him speak well about it.\" Evans has also been able to speak to his Irish room-mate, Healy, about that. Healy, who plays for Leeds, made just one Premiership appearance for United, as a substitute for Ryan Giggs in a match six years ago. \"Then,\" as Evans said, \"he ended up moving on, he knows how tough it is to break through. I don't want that happening to me.\" That appears unlikely, because as Evans added: \"Alex Ferguson has already said that maybe I will be playing for the first team in a year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
