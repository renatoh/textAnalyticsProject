As the Police Federation stepped up its campaign over pay, with a warning that its members feel betrayed by the government, the TUC claimed ministers were in danger of damaging the country's industrial relations. The TUC will launch Speak Up for Public Services in London on Tuesday to campaign against the government's target of 2 per cent pay rises across the public sector, resulting in pay increases below inflation for hundreds of thousands of workers. The federation, which is not a member of the TUC, has called for the resignation of the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, after she staggered a 2.5 per cent award for the police to meet the government's pay target. Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, said: 'The government is making a big mistake by trying to cut the living standards of public servants four years in a row.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
