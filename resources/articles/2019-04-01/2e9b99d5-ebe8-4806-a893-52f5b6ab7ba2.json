I just don\u2019t want that stuff coming back to me, I\u2019ll stay out of it.\u201d It is now astonishing to think those are the words of Billy Vunipola explaining his self-imposed social media ban only a month ago. Whatever compelled him to end it, there is far more than ridicule now heading his way. Quite what Vunipola thought he was achieving by offering his public support to Australia\u2019s Israel Folau, who had claimed that \u201chell awaits\u201d homosexuals, is not clear but one by one on Friday the statements of disapproval arrived. The Rugby Football Union came first, then Saracens, the players\u2019 union, Premiership Rugby and Channel 4, which wasted no time in dropping Vunipola as one of the faces of its rugby coverage. As far as the RFU is concerned it now has a crisis on its hands. It must deal with a very modern problem \u2013 that of players using social media to air or support abhorrent views \u2013 and an outdated one in homophobia. Because, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, rugby has a problem with homophobia. It is evidently not restricted to these shores, as demonstrated by Folau\u2019s latest outburst. But, judging by the number of Premiership and/or England players who \u201cliked\u201d Vunipola\u2019s post, it is widespread. Granted, to \u201clike\u201d something is not necessarily to endorse it and it is likely some of those who did so were coming out in support of their teammate rather than of his viewpoint. But to do so is at best misguided and the RFU will be missing the point if it considers this an isolated incident and examines only Vunipola\u2019s role in it. For, if there is any good to come from last week\u2019s events, it is that rugby\u2019s claim to be free from homophobia has been exposed as a fallacy and that is something the RFU must play its part in addressing. Perhaps part of the reason why rugby has allowed itself to make that assumption is the positive reaction received by the former Wales captain Gareth Thomas and the leading referee Nigel Owens when coming out as gay. Of course the goodwill received by both is hugely positive but let\u2019s not kid ourselves that rugby does not have a problem when there is not a single Premiership and/or England player who is openly gay. The RFU must also not forget there are players to have represented England women \u2013 just as Vunipola does for Eddie Jones\u2019s side \u2013 who are. The union trumpets its commitment to inclusion and diversity. It has been working with the LGBT charity Stonewall for the past two years as part of its Try for Change programme and often states its commitment to rugby\u2019s core values. Now is the time to marry action with slogans. The RFU must show a firm hand when it sits down with Vunipola this week but it should not look for a silver bullet to solve the two issues it faces in one go. It must not be distracted by trying to ascertain whether Vunipola is inherently homophobic. That is not the union\u2019s job. Vunipola is among the most open, welcoming and friendly members of the England squad and one of the most valuable to Jones, too. The RFU must not be distracted by that either. For it was to the union\u2019s great detriment that in 2016 the then chief executive, Ian Ritchie, took a lenient view of Joe Marler calling Samson Lee \u201cGypsy boy\u201d because he felt it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d rather than racist. Making that distinction was not the job of the RFU; sending the clearest message that such a comment will not be tolerated was, and so with Vunipola the union must act. That is not to say Vunipola\u2019s views are irrelevant and the hope is that education \u2013 perhaps spending time with one of the UK\u2019s gay rugby teams \u2013 is part of his punishment. The RFU must also play its part in dealing with a problem that exists across the world game. It is a complex problem; Folau and Vunipola used their strong Christian beliefs to justify their comments and a number of Pacific Islanders who \u201cliked\u201c their posts share such religious views. But as Stonewall said on Friday: \u201cFaith is often used to justify anti-LGBT views and attitudes. This is wrong and perpetuates a myth that faith and LGBT inclusion cannot coexist.\u201d First, however, the union must sanction Vunipola for using his public profile and platform to air his views that \u201cman is made for woman\u201d. It must act because as the arbiter of rugby in this country it must demonstrate that voicing these kinds of opinions is unacceptable. Speech may be free but there must be consequences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
