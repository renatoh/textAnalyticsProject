For now, however, she leaves these world championships with nothing more to show for her efforts than pride in an outdoor 5,000m personal best. The 24-year-old, who has set five British records and two European records at distances ranging from 1,000m to 5,000m in the past year, simply could not handle the hot pace of the favourite, Hellen Obiri, and the Ethiopian Almaz Ayana when they ripped the race open shortly before halfway or indeed, of a second pack that formed which chased the bronze medal. But Muir still showed immense grit to finish as quickly as she did before coming sixth in 14.52.07 \u2013 and afterwards she said she was happy with how the race had gone. \u201cI was always going to let Obiri and Ayana go,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew they were in a different class so I wasn\u2019t too worried about them breaking away. I also knew I had a lot of rounds in my legs so I had to pace myself and stay strong. I think I showed that over the last lap. To finish in the way I did makes me really happy.\u201d Ahead of her Obiri sprinted clear with 300m to go to win in 14.34.86, with Ayana taking silver six seconds back. The Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan, who has made significant steps since joining Mo Farah\u2019s coach Alberto Salazar, took bronze in 14.42.73. Muir added: \u201cThe African girls are so strong, so I am pleased with how I ran. I was so close to the medals, finishing fourth and sixth in the finals. Five races in ten days is a lot so I think I can take a lot of positives.\u201d Eilish McColgan, who produced another fine performance to finish 10th in 15.00.43, said the race had not gone as she expected. \u201cWe were practically walking those first couple of laps,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock to the system when you go from walking then in to a fast pace.\u201d Meanwhile Chris O\u2019Hare\u2019s World Championships ended with bitter disappointment as he finished last in the men\u2019s 1500m final. Elijah Manangoi sailed past his Kenyan compatriot Timothy Cheruiyot in the last 50m to take the gold medal with Filip Ingebrigtsen clinching a memorable bronze for Norway. \u201cI felt good and the plan was to stay comfortable,\u201d said O\u2019Hare. \u201cBut that third lap was just horrible for me and I was stuck in a horrible cadence, a horrible tempo. It was just rubbish. I know I am so much better than last place today. It\u2019s hard to process at the moment as I haven\u2019t seen it. All I know is I wasn\u2019t good enough today and it\u2019s tough to take.\u201d Tom Bosworth was also left a heartbroken man after seeing his hopes of a World Championship medal in the 20km walk crushed by a disqualification on The Mall. Bosworth, who finished sixth at last year\u2019s Olympics in Rio, was hoping to become the first Briton to claim a major championship medal in the event since the 1964 Olympics. He led the way for much of the first half of the race before disaster struck. Bosworth said: \u201cI was feeling great and walking faster than I ever have done. It all seemed to be going fine until 12km and I got two red cards on that lap. I put in a burst and was pushing the boundaries but it was a real shock to get the third red card.\u201d Elsewhere Qatar\u2019s Mutaz Essa Barshim secured high jump gold with a winning leap of 2.35m. The Russian Danil Lysenko, competing as a neutral athlete, took silver with 2.32m while Majd Eddin Ghazal, of Syria, had the best record of three men who cleared 2.29m to take bronze \u2013 his country\u2019s first world championship medal for a male competitor. Britain\u2019s Robbie Grabarz bowed out having failed to clear 2.29m. Sandra Perkovic took the discus title with a throw of 70.31m. Dani Stevens, of Australia, took silver with Melina Robert-Michon of France in third."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
