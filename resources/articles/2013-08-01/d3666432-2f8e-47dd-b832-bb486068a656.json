Bruce and his Hull team are back in the big time and on both counts the return is somewhat unexpected. Few thought they would see the manager compete at the highest level of English football again after he was sacked by Sunderland in 2011, while Hull faced the prospect of financial meltdown following their relegation from the Premier League the previous year. But having come together a little over 12 months ago when Bruce was appointed manager by the club's owner, Assem Allam, and with automatic promotion secured on the final day of the Championship season, Hull is, in Bruce's own words, \"crackling with excitement\" about the season ahead, which begins with Sunday's visit to Chelsea. \"The interest, the big grounds, the players, the atmosphere \u2013 the Premier League is the real deal and to be part of it again is why I came here,\" he said. \"I've missed it. I think there's only me, Sam Allardyce and David Moyes as British managers who've done 10 or 12 years in the Premier League \u2013 apart from Sir Alex [Ferguson] of course \u2013 and you take pride from that, and if you've got anything about you it's where you want to be.\" Bruce is under no illusions that his principal task is avoiding relegation and, drawing on the experience of stabilising Birmingham in the top flight following their promotion in 2002 and of keeping Wigan up after returning there in 2007, the 52-year-old has brought eight new players into the club over the summer, six of whom have Premier League experience \u2013 the most recent being Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore \u2013 while Allan McGregor is Scotland's No1 goalkeeper and the striker Yannick Sagbo was last season playing in Ligue 1 with Evian. The transfer policy is clear \u2013 sign those who have the temperament as well as talent to compete at the highest level. \"Mentality is huge,\" Bruce said. \"But if you see the players we've brought in we look physically strong and powerful too, which you need in this division. It's unforgiving. I was looking at the Chelsea squad and it's mouth-watering \u2013 if anyone here is wondering what the Premier League is about they're going to find out on Sunday. \"It's going to be packed to the rafters and the interest is remarkable because of Jos\u00e9 [Mourinho]. We could not want for a bigger challenge and after all those dark, horrible nights in the Championship let's hope this makes up for it.\" Hull fell back into the second tier after two seasons in the Premier League which, initially at least, promised much. The side, then managed by Phil Brown, won six of their opening nine fixtures of the 2008-09 campaign, including successive victories at Arsenal and Tottenham to find themselves third in late October. But a run of six straight defeats either side of Christmas saw Hull rapidly descend down the table and ultimately survive by a point. \"Not at one stage during that season did I think we'd get relegated,\" said Brown, who was sacked by Hull near the end of the following campaign as the club's then owners tried unsuccessfully to halt relegation. \"Key to us surviving was having strong-minded, experienced players in the squad like Nick Barmby, Dean Windass and George Boateng who kept everyone believing when things were going badly. The supporters were also crucial. It's a cliche but they were our 12th man \u2013 they never stopped backing us and they will need to be the same again this time around.\" In that regard preparations for the new season were hardly helped by Allam's decision to change the name of the club from Hull City AFC to Hull City Tigers, a move which has angered many fans. Bruce is unconcerned about the furore, however, and has given his full support to the man who hired him and, this summer, has sanctioned close to \u00a313m worth of fresh recruits. The acquisition of Huddlestone for a club record fee of \u00a35.1m has particularly delighted Bruce and not just because of the 26-year-old's power and passing range. Sunderland were also keen on the player and Bruce made no secret of what it meant to have outdone the club which discarded him a little under two years ago. \"I knew he [Paolo Di Canio, the Sunderland manager] rang Tom \u2013 I'll drop that grenade in,\" Bruce said, allowing a smile to return to his face. \"So there was competition, but I met Tom in London and just said to him 'come and play for us and enjoy your football'.\" There is no doubt Bruce intends to enjoy himself too having been away from the Premier League glare for so long. \"I'd love to manage a team at the other end of the division but that's not the way the cards have been dealt,\" he said. \"I've been pigeonholed as someone who is decent at putting a team together and keeping them up, and in that regard my record stacks up. I know it's going to be difficult but I'm looking forward to the challenge.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
