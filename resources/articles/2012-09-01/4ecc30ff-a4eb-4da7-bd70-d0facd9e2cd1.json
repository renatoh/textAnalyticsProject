On Friday afternoon there was a satellite truck at the bottom of our street lying in wait, to see if our chief constable, implicated in the Hillsborough scandal, would fall on his sword. Not wishing to have to go to the trouble of getting dressed \u2013 I should warn you, Friday is my day off, so this contains graphic scenes of me in my underpants, but on the up-side, no flash photography \u2013 I switched on the BBC News Channel, in that very modern way, to see what was happening 100 yards away. I was greeted by the BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell wearing his gravest expression, the one reserved for the death of a royal, or as it turns out, pictures of a duchess, d\u00e9shabill\u00e9, being published in a French magazine. His lengthy report \u2013 from in front of Buckingham Palace, in case we were in any doubt this was a royal story \u2013 was followed by one from Nick Higham, another of the BBC's top guys, examining what 24-hour news is contractually obliged to call \"the implications\". Excuse me, I thought, did I not go to bed last night stunned and angered by one of the biggest establishment cover-ups of all time, moved to tears by the victims' stories, and am I now expected to apportion outrage to this admittedly regrettable but ultimately unimportant invasion of privacy? Sorry, none left. I suppose the show must go on, but sometimes I am tempted to echo Noel Coward and ask why. It's different for sports programmes, where the agenda is clearly defined in the fixture lists, and staying put is not an option. At Loftus Road, for instance, there was the Ferdinand handshake snub to cover, now becoming as much a part of the fabric of an English football season as pies at half-time, sunshine on opening day, and Alan Green complaining about the view from his commentary position. Rather as interest in the FA Cup has waned in recent times, the snub is no longer getting the coverage it used to \u2013 perhaps a high-profile sponsor is needed, Flit maybe, or one of those insect repellents. The consensus among the Match of the Day pundits, and QPR manager Mark Hughes, was that the pre-match handshakes might as well be scrapped. They were only introduced four years ago, as part of the Respect campaign, encouraging footballers to respect fellow professionals, regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation, and how ridiculous the colour of the fellow professional's sponsored boots might be; but the campaign has clearly become the football equivalent of prefacing a statement with \u2026 \"With the greatest respect\", when you mean the exact opposite. Undoubtedly the appetite for news channel-style analysis of the snub was dulled by the presence of Alan Hansen in the MotD studio. As one of the Liverpool team on 15 April 1989, his reaction to the Hillsborough report was by some distance more germane than anything any lip-readers and body language experts brought in to deconstruct the Terry-Ferdinand imbroglio might say. Like many of those involved in the Hillsborough story \u2013 the commentator Steve Wilson, on Football Focus, who attended the match as a fan, was another \u2013 Hansen's tone seemed almost one of weariness, having finally received official confirmation of what has been known on Merseyside for 23 years. Those of us, meanwhile, for whom one of the most shocking aspects of the report was the depth to which the tentacles of corruption reached, might have been forewarned by the 1999 Oscar-winning documentary One Day In September, fortuitously shown on BBC2 on the eve of the Hillsborough Report. The lengths to which the German authorities went to cover up their role in the events that led to the deaths of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 could almost be a template for South Yorkshire police 17 years later. They even colluded with Black September over the hijacking of a jet to get three of the terrorists safely out of the way in Syria. Also, the rapid resumption of the Olympics after the tragedy gave today's 24-hour news channels an object lesson in indecent haste. It was, in short, a week when the shadow of Hillsborough fell over everything one watched, even a breezy documentary about David Sullivan returning to take over the Sunday Sport. Sullivan approved the front-page lead, Jacko Chimp Fingers Killer Doc, in which the late singer's pet chimp is reported to have broken his silence over his owner's fatal medication regime. Sullivan is cheerfully unconcerned about the veracity of the story. \"People are not always sure what's made up and what's true,\" he said. \"Sometimes they don't believe the true stories but they think the made-up stories are true,\" which may be how The Sun was operating back in 1989."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
