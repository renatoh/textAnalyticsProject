The pick of the fourth-round ties is the second Edinburgh derby in eight days. Following on from last weekend's scoreless draw at Tynecastle, Hearts lost 1-0 in a dismal encounter at Motherwell on Wednesday evening. That match, says the Hearts and former Manchester United player Stewart, illustrated why Scotland should not host winter matches. \"It's not enjoyable to play in and I'm pretty sure it's not enjoyable to watch,\" he said. \"Something needs to be looked at. Over the piece you will see a lot better games in the summer rather than at this time of the year. When it gets to this stage of the year, teams who would generally try to play some football just can't. It then digresses into shite football.\" Hibs, meanwhile, have scores to settle. Not only have they failed to lift the Scottish Cup in 107 years, but they were also defeated 4-0 by Hearts in the semi-final of 2006, the last time the two teams met in this tournament. \"Every year we hear people talking about how long it has been since we won the cup,\" admitted the Hibs defender Chris Hogg. \"Previous years have nothing to do with this year, just as we can't look any further forward than the next round. I don't believe in hoodoos or anything like that.\" Celtic manager Gordon Strachan will take a step back in time tomorrow afternoon as his team host First Division Dundee. Strachan started his playing career as a teenager at Dens Park and ultimately replaced the current Dundee manager, Jocky Scott, in the first-team. \"I modelled myself a lot on Jocky as a player,\" Strachan recalled. \"I loved it up there, I spent about five years laughing and enjoying myself, sometimes too much. It was a great club to be at, a great grounding and I picked up a lot of good habits there. Some of my off-field habits weren't as good as my on-field ones, mind you. Going into digs as a 15-year-old, I had to grow up pretty quickly. I would have no money on a Monday morning because the older players had beaten me at cards.\" Tomorrow represents the latest test of Strachan's relationship with Aiden McGeady, the winger who has yet to feature for Celtic since a dressing-room spat with and subsequent suspension from his manager. The 22-year-old is expected to play some part in the cup tie but Strachan was again unwilling to discuss the matter except to say: \"It's finished.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
