Israeli and Palestinian security officials were expected to meet last night to discuss arrangements for the deployment of Palestinian forces along the Gaza border while the new president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, continued his attempts to persuade Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other armed Islamist groups to agree to a ceasefire. But while Israel's security cabinet approved the resumption of contacts with the PA - broken off after a bomb attack on a Gaza border post killed six Israelis last week - it also authorised a major military operation in the Gaza Strip if Mr Abbas fails to win a truce from resistance groups or find other means to curb the attacks on Israeli targets. Hamas and its allies have said they will not agree to a truce without a guarantee that Israel will halt its assassinations and other attacks on them. Mr Sharon is not prepared to give any such assurance. He wants Mr Abbas to disarm Islamist groups, not negotiate with them. But Palestinian officials said yesterday that Mr Abbas has accepted that Hamas and Islamic Jihad need some form of guarantee and he was attempting to work out a formula, possibly with the help of the Egyptian government. The head of Palestinian forces in Gaza, General Abdel Razek Majaide, said he will deploy men along the Gaza border before the end of the week to prevent rocket attacks against the Israeli town of Sderot. One attack there last week left a teenage girl brain dead. But Palestinian security force leaders said it will be made more difficult without Israeli cooperation when, for instance, Palestinian troops are operating within range of Israeli military posts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
