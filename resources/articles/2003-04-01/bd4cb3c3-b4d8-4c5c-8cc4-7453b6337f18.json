The best of them, on this evidence, keep their heads down and work at their art. Michael Hamburger, Harry Guest and Peter Dale are senior figures in Anvil's impressive stable of poet-translators, and Peter Jay's press, with its good editing and high production values, has stood by them over the stretch. They've doubtless been critically mugged now and then in what Hamburger's autobiography called, endorsing Eliot's phrase, this \"mug's game\". Each of their titles has a modesty that supposes it better not to stick your chin out when on the market stall. Hamburger's is the most misleading, for his is no sampling, and its materials are not \"non-events\". This book-length poem, From a Diary of Non-Events (Anvil, \u00a37.95), is a shaped set of 12 sequences, based on observations in the months from December 2000 to November 2001 - which means that, yes, he has a passage about that non-non-event on September 11. In \"March\", \"Soon a fox, the survivor / Of hunts and gamekeeper's gun, / Will be stalking\". Hamburger means by his title the minute incidents taking place around him; and they are not poetic non-events either because he delivers them with a vivid sense of their endangered value. Their being endangered - by the actions of humanity - makes them that much less inconsequential. Hamburger can be moody; a neighbour invites him to \"Look on the bright side!\" \"I . . . Try hard to smile,\" he admits, \"and don't confess / That a true owl's hoot chills me less / Than chirped complaisant cheerfulness.\" He confesses it to his readers, though. This one finds his owl's hoot thoroughly convincing. From a Diary of Non-Events repays the implicit trust it invites. Harry Guest's collected poems, A Puzzling Harvest: Collected Poems 1955-2000 (Anvil, \u00a318), are the harvest of his puzzlings and a harvest that can puzzle. When Basho visited the pine-topped islands near Sendai, he wrote no haiku. \"My pen strove in vain,\" the Japanese poet wrote, \"to equal this superb creation of divine artifice.\" Guest's \"Matsushima\" has more than four pages in 1960s-style jigsaw collage: \"transfixed as never before/ on no future)// 'enisl'd'// my private mouth goes over/ the dark memory of your body\". There's a clue in the one-word allusion to Matthew Arnold's \"in the sea of life enisled . . . we . . . live alone\". Where Hamburger, in his too modest terms, is a \"cultivator / Of unsaleable fruit\", Guest is a migrant hunter-gatherer. His travel notes, \"December in Kagoshima\" for example, are usually attractive; but the translator of Victor Hugo can lack focus and inclines to prolixity. He's at his best in poems like \"Dufy's Flags\", \"Spring 1604\" or \"Closing In\" - where a circumscribed occasion is scouted: \"The cold sea organises its blockade. / Noon now a / mockery, sail, martin, sapling, emblems / of the gone. / Time hangs behind its cobwebs. In the wings / a figure / absent at rehearsals waits his cue.\" This moves from crisp observation to mysterious implication, balancing the sway of his pentameters and their interleaved, three-syllable pausings. Guest has also selected from his translations, including a number such as \"The Departure of the Prodigal Son\" from Rilke's Neue Gedichte - exemplary in pointing readers at great poems by way of good ones. The experience of translating ought to help with dramatic lyrics with two speakers, but in the exchange of poems between Eurydice and Orpheus from Peter Dale's Under the Breath (Anvil, \u00a37.95) the timbre of the lines is identical. If other pieces weren't sign-posted, you couldn't tell who speaks them. One Another, the 1970s sonnet sequence reissued by Peter Hoy's new press (Waywiser, \u00a38.95), has a title that announces a poetry of relationship, but here too it's hard to sense the tug of fully dramatised differences. Dale writes with a quiet, approximative skill; he may deliver an affecting piece like \"Mottled\"; but his poems (\"Short Story\", for instance, on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Channel Islands) can reveal unresolved residues and bitter aftertastes. His blurbs play variations on the injustice of his lack of laurels. It may be better to accept that there just is no justice in worldly repute, and no reputations deserved yet not had. Under the Breath ends by elegising Ian Hamilton, whose Against Oblivion: Some Lives of Twentieth-Century Poets Dale has been reading: \"Your voice against oblivion. / You'd always take the longest odds: / you've made me weep - reading your words. / The times I'd meant to tell you, Ian. // Something ingrained in our war-child years: / tears were the thing to fight against / when drained of every other strength. / And now these words instead of tears. The rhyme of \"Ian\" with \"oblivion\" is telling enough, clinching what the sense may be resisting. I never met him. His published opinions about how poets contribute to a culture would never be mine. While I can understand the sentiment, I don't share it; so, for me, its bare versification is, as he tells his reviewer subject, just \"rhyme enough for you to pan\". Another survival tactic is -Hamilton-fashion - to write little, but be sure when you publish to have connections who'll roll the log. A Alvarez's jacket for New &amp; Selected Poems (Waywiser, \u00a38.95) calls upon, among others, a \"greatly impressed\" Frank Kermode, Alfred Brendel on \"verse of such distinction\", and Alan Jenkins's \"wonderment and gratitude\". I accuse no one of insincerity; it's that the strategy is misjudged. And the proof is in the pudding. From 50s formalist pieces, Alvarez shifts to 60s expressionist-confessional lyrics, then ossifies. One of nine produced since 1976, \"Mermaid\" pictures how \"You swim into my life only at night / To end up here in the dark between the sheets, / In the gap between dreaming and waking, / Coming ashore with your smile, / Your sea-scent and thrashing tail, / Still slippery from the creation\". So I see \"between the sheets\" a \"slippery\", \"thrashing tail\" - a wet-dream at the fishmonger's. He uses poetaster description: \"the tender blue of the sky\"; \"like rain her voice sighs in the pines\". He can't hear inapposite associations: \"The grinning midwife lift[s] on high, heels first, / The child\". She was wearing stilettos? And he uses \"strange\" like Pater never repainted the Mona Lisa : \"the strange world\", \"strange as my own youth\". Alvarez has not written this number of poems because \"the standard he sets . . . is too high\"; it's because he has barely any inspiration and an unreliable critical intelligence. Born in 1918, the poet John Heath-Stubbs is a survivor in every sense. He's lived a difficult life, and produced a laurel-strewn oeuvre despite being partially sighted from birth and subsequently blind. His modest blurb contains just one plea-bargaining quote from the TLS. The Return of the Cranes (Carcanet, \u00a39.95) is characteristic, though, of the poet in anecdotage. There are attractive toasts, news comments, gifts, jokes, burlesques and poems spun from memories. There's an arresting one about a years-dead Oxford contemporary called Philip Larkin \"Lying sleepless through a long tedious night\" who \"passionately refused his credence\" to any afterlife beyond that, perhaps, of his poems - poems like the \"Aubade\" Heath-Stubbs recalls in his verses. Believers have their faith to get them through; poets have only the long and short of their art and lives. \u00b7 Peter Robinson's Selected Poems is published by Carcanet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
