Major incidents in hospitals are usually seen only in the busy winter months but are now becoming a problem all year round, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said. The college, which is holding its annual congress in Glasgow, said that across England, the hospital sector is feeling the strain of financial pressures and increased demand. It highlighted a series of issues facing local hospitals that are \u201cadding to the chaos\u201d at hospitals across England. These include: \u2022 Beds being placed in corridors and patients treated in storerooms in order to move people out of A&amp;E. \u2022 Ambulances queuing outside A&amp;E units or the regular use of \u201cjumbulances\u201d \u2013 large ambulances which can accommodate multiple patients \u2013 to treat patients while they wait to enter the units. \u2022 Patients, often frail older people, being moved at night due to intense pressure for beds. \u2022 Hospitals running with no spare capacity at all. Janet Davies, the RCN\u2019s chief executive and general secretary, said: \u201cHaving once been the preserve of the worst weeks of winter, overwhelming pressure and major incidents have sadly become the new normal in our hospitals. Units are having to be closed and operations cancelled due to the level of demand when there is no extreme weather, and no major outbreaks of infectious diseases. \u201cDespite the best efforts and dedication of the staff, these pressures are affecting patients at every stage in their treatment. She said the pressures were leading to patients getting sicker and needing to stay in hospital for longer as a result. \u201cIt is time we had a serious look at how long hospitals can continue to function when they are consistently underfunded and understaffed.\u201d Janet Youd, an A&amp;E nurse in Yorkshire and chair of the RCN emergency care association, said she could not guarantee patients would get safe care in an emergency department. She said: \u201cI have been an emergency care nurse for 25 years, and the news is that the attrition rate of emergency nurses leaving emergency departments is at a level it has never ever been before. \u201cMany emergency departments are struggling but managing to fill their shifts with expensive agency shifts, but they are not necessarily emergency nurses. \u201cThat means that if you or I have an emergency today ... you could go to an emergency department and it would be sheer luck that you had an emergency nurse there with the right skills and the right training to treat you.\u201d The British Medical Association has separately called for an end to the ongoing process of hospital bed closures. The doctors\u2019 union overwhelmingly passed a motion at its annual conference on Monday which said \u201ctrends in reducing hospital beds have gone too far and need to be urgently re-evaluated\u201d. Dr Mary McCarthy, a GP, told the BMA\u2019s annual conference: \u201cHospital beds in the UK have been steadily eroded without the corresponding increase in social care that is needed to support this move. The UK has less than 300 beds per 100,000 population and in Shropshire, where I am, it\u2019s less than 200. \u201cIn the Irish Republic it\u2019s about 500, in Belgium it\u2019s over 650, in France it\u2019s over 700, in Germany it\u2019s over 800, in Austria it\u2019s over 700, in Romania it\u2019s over 600. Do we really need to keep cutting beds? Are we not finding that our hospitals are bulging at the seams with people who should be there but are discharged home too early and unsafely?\u201d Figures collated by the King\u2019s Fund show the number of hospital beds in both acute and mental health facilities has halved to about 150,000 in England over the last 30 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
