Lord Saville, chairman of the tribunal into the January 1972 killings, said today that no further legal action would be taken against Channel 4 News correspondent Alex Thomson and his ex-colleague Lena Ferguson. But today's ruling doesn't apply to Harnden, the Telegraph's Middle East correspondent, who is already the subject of proceedings in the high court after refusing to disclose his notes to the inquiry. Harnden, who is estimated to have run up hundreds of thousands of pounds of legal costs in the case, has said that his case will proceed unless the Bloody Sunday inquiry applies to the high court to have the contempt case against him dropped in line with the ruling on Thomson and Ferguson. \"Today's ruling shows the tribunal clearly wants to extricate itself from the tangle it got itself into regarding my case,\" Harnden told the Press Association. \"To do so, it will have to apply to the high court to have the case dropped. Inevitably, the question of their paying costs will arise.\" \"The way I have been pursued and vilified by the tribunal for maintaining my journalistic duty to protect confidential sources is a disgrace and Lord Saville should be ashamed over how he had dealt with this issue.\" The Saville inquiry, which has so far cost \u00a3155m of taxpayers' money, is the most expensive in legal history. On the final day of evidence to the inquiry today, Lord Saville said he would not be pursuing legal action against the journalists, because he believed it would not produce any new information of value and would delay the completion of the inquiry. \"Having considered the matter, the tribunal has concluded that it is not appropriate to take any further steps in these cases,\" Lord Saville said. \"It is unlikely that any further action will produce new information of real value to its investigation of the events of Bloody Sunday.\" \"Furthermore, any attempt to pursue the matter is likely to cause substantial delay in completing this inquiry, which has already lasted more than six years.\" While he was Ireland correspondent for the Telegraph in the late 1990s, Harnden interviewed several former paratroopers who were in Derry on January 31 1972, when 13 people were killed during a civil rights march. The inquiry summoned the reporter to Derry and ordered him to hand over his notes of those interviews. Harden refused and was found guilty of contempt. Thomson and Ferguson were also threatened with contempt of court proceedings when they first appeared before the tribunal in May 2002. The pair pledged to go to jail rather than name five soldiers whom they had interviewed for a series of Channel 4 reports to mark the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. However, they promised to contact them and ask them to relieve them of their duty of confidentiality. Two of the soldiers agreed, and a third was already known to the inquiry under the code name \"cipher 027\", but Ferguson and Thomson still refuse to name the remaining two. The journalists were called before Lord Saville's inquiry a second time last month, when they were told he was still \"actively considering\" legal action against them. Thomson warned at the time that the issue of protecting sources was fundamental to society, while Ferguson said it would be ironic if two people who were not in Derry on Bloody Sunday went to prison as a result of the inquiry. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
