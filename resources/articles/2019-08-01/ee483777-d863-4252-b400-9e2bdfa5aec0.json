Hours later, two more bombs went off 100 miles away, killing 18 soldiers from the parachute regiment, the biggest single loss of the British army in Northern Ireland. Not a day that is easy to forget, but what is clear from The Day Mountbatten Died (BBC Two) is just how present the emotions of loss are four decades on. The rescue helicopter crew member who pulled Mountbatten\u2019s 14-year-old grandson, Nicholas, out of the water says unflinchingly that he sees his face \u201cover and over \u2026 I\u2019m OK with that because I brought that kid home\u201d. India Hicks, Mountbatten\u2019s granddaughter who, aged 11, was there on holiday (but not on the boat that day) seems surprised at how tearful she becomes. \u201cThe damage that was done was so much deeper than any of us could ever have imagined,\u201d she says, voice barely holding up. \u201cAnd adult lives are still being horrifically disrupted.\u201d The film is a plea to remember, while skilfully telling the story of the day \u2013 and the context in which it took place \u2013 mainly through those who were there (although it\u2019s a shame that Timothy Knatchbull, who wrote a book about surviving the blast that killed his two grandparents and his twin brother, didn\u2019t feature). Every year, Mountbatten \u2013 the Queen\u2019s second cousin and the last viceroy of India \u2013 took his family to Classiebawn Castle in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, just 13 miles from the border. \u201cThe heart of the holiday was going out on the boat,\u201d remembers Hicks. It seems impossible to make a BBC documentary featuring the royal family that doesn\u2019t have the sheen of unctuousness. Mountbatten and his family, said his biographer Philip Ziegler, were regarded as \u201cbenevolent, well-meaning, helpful\u201d by the villagers. They brought \u201cglamour\u201d and jobs. One, who worked as a waiter at the house, treasures a photograph of himself serving the family; his mother still has a Barbara Cartland book given to her by Mountbatten. It\u2019s not all cosy paternalism. \u201cClassiebawn itself had been a fairly early example of what you might call English colonisation,\u201d says Ziegler. Hicks remembers the mountainside where \u201cthere was a big painted sign saying \u2018Brits go home\u2019. You arrive for your summer holiday and that\u2019s the welcome.\u201d The family had protection from the local police, but not to an excessive degree. The retelling of the blast itself \u2013 caused by a 50lb remote-controlled bomb planted the night before \u2013 was gut-wrenching. It was like a crack of thunder, recalls Mary Hornsey, the mother of 15-year-old Paul Maxwell, who had a summer job as Mountbatten\u2019s boat boy. \u201cI knew he was dead because I felt a part of me go.\u201d A few hours later, a bomb targeted an army convoy near Warrenpoint. Tom Caughey, one of just two survivors from the lorry that was hit, vividly describes gathering his strength to let his troop know he was still alive. They were doing, he says, \u201ca roll call of the dead\u201d. Half an hour later, another bomb went off by a gate lodge \u2013 the IRA unit rightly believed that was where the soldiers would regroup \u2013 taking the toll to 18. It was, says the company commander, Mike Jackson, with stiff upper lip understatement, \u201ca pretty grim sight\u201d, before going on to remember there were body parts in the trees. A civilian also died, shot by a soldier who wrongly believed he was involved in the attack. The feel of the IRA prisoners, remembers Anthony McIntyre, a former member who was in the Maze prison, was \u201cexuberance, exhilaration\u201d at the news. Olivia O\u2019Leary, a reporter at the Irish Times, puts it in context of the horrific events of Bloody Sunday seven years earlier. \u201cThere was a particular feeling of dislike towards the paratroopers,\u201d she says. But the targeting of Mountbatten and his family was different. \u201cAlmost everybody spoke with regret and shame about what had happened to Mountbatten,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. McIntyre, pointing out that senior IRA figures would have known children would have been on the boat, calls it a \u201cwar crime\u201d. There was nothing truly revelatory here, not even the fairly flat disclosure from Kieran Conway, the one-time director of intelligence for the IRA, that an assassination attempt on Mountbatten had been considered four years earlier. But there was plenty of genuine feeling. \u201cI wanted to be with them,\u201d says Caughey of his dead comrades. \u201cWhy did I survive?\u201d The grief of Maxwell\u2019s mother is almost unbearable to watch. In contrast is the weirdness of the upper classes. Hicks remembers being taken with her siblings into the castle\u2019s study and given pills to swallow. \u201cDear God. Would you give an 11-year-old Valium?\u201d she asks, incredulous. She was sent off to boarding school just a week after her grandfather\u2019s state funeral, where other girls made horrible jokes about his death. A clip of Prince Charles giving a speech about the murder of his mentor shows him reciting poetry instead of talking like a normal person. O\u2019Leary swiftly punctures his invocation of Yeats\u2019s line about peace \u201cdropping slow\u201d. \u201cPeace has to be worked at damn hard,\u201d she says. It is not, she says, \u201ca passive thing. It is always going to be a continuing responsibility on all of us in these islands to make sure that the conditions in Northern Ireland do not encourage the breakout again of sectarian tensions.\u201d Maddeningly, there are people now who need to be reminded of this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
