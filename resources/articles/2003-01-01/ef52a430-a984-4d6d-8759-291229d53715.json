That extraordinary decision by someone in the bowels of the DfES to publish the 14-19 stuff and the higher education white paper on consecutive days last week? All the available evidence shouts cock-up, though one official half-heartedly tried to claim that the two documents were natural bedmates. Both announcements had been subjected to earlier delays before it was declared that each would come out in January - a 31-day month with plenty of room for each to keep clear of the other. Then at some stage along the way, a nice white card whistled in from the Association of Colleges inviting minisiters to a conference about 14-19 last Tuesday. And that is where David Miliband (pictured) found himself officially launching the new document. Which is a jolly cunning way of smoking out government policy - throw a shindig for the ministers concerned. Clearly, they can never resist a good conference. So why didn't they give 14-19 a bit of air and leave the white paper until this week? Instead of which there was the predictable brief frenzy about the death of A-levels, which are taken by a minority of young people, and practically zilch about the more interesting stuff on zapping the age-old British academic snobbery and letting 14-year-olds loose on heavy machinery. And then all radar immediately swivelled to university fees. But had 14-19 been given more space, there would only have been more huffing about A-levels and the end of the gold standard blah blah. So it was all probably for the best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
