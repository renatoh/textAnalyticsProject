England have just beaten Germany, the team who put seven past Brazil en route to winning the last World Cup, and the hype-meter has been duly cranked up on the back of the finest performance of the Hodgson era, as it often tends to be when there is a major tournament approaching. So, does Hodgson think England, with all those disappointments behind them, 50 years of hurt and all that, can actually surprise everyone and go to France in the summer as genuine contenders to win the damn thing? Thankfully, the England manager chose the sensible option. \u201cIt\u2019s the impossible question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cIf I say yes, then it\u2019s \u2018Hodgson thinks we can win the Euros!\u2019 headlines. If I say that it\u2019s going to be tough, and too much to ask of this young team, then it\u2019s \u2018Hodgson has no confidence in the team\u2019. \u201cAll I can say is that these players haven\u2019t done it yet in a tournament. We still don\u2019t really know if this young group is going to perform in tournament conditions against much more experienced teams such as Germany, who are used to reaching finals and winning tournaments, or France, the home nation. \u201cSo the question remains an impossible one to answer. I can only be boring and cliched and say I believe in this team, absolutely. I believe we\u2019re going to be ready and I believe the players will go into games believing they can win them and believing they can do well. But for me to say \u2018this is what we\u2019re going to do\u2019 would be very foolhardy in the first place and, secondly, dishonest because the truth is I don\u2019t know.\u201d He couched it perfectly, especially for those who were with him on the training camp in Miami before the World Cup when, barely a day after one of his predecessors, Sven-Goran Eriksson, stated there was \u201cabsolutely no way\u201d England could win it, the manager abandoned all restraint and fell into the trap. England, Hodgson said back then, could become the first European nation to win the tournament in South America and \u201canyone who thinks we can\u2019t is barking up the wrong tree\u201d. That did not go too well and everyone thankfully in the England camp appears to be more circumspect these days, even if Jonjo Shelvey did let slip when he was called up last August that Hodgson had told his players there was no reason why they could not go to France with the ambition of beating everyone else. For now, however, the most important matter against Holland on Tuesday night is for England to continue their forward momentum and, unfortunately for Jack Butland, the goalkeeper\u2019s fractured ankle has been a reminder of the harsh facts of football life before these tournaments. Hodgson was deprived of an entire XI of injured players before Euro 2012 and the reality is that Butland will probably not be the only absentee to suffer this misfortune. For Butland, facing a three\u2011month lay-off, there is no chance. \u201cIs it too strong to say your heart\u2019s been broken?\u201d Hodgson asked. \u201cHis dream has certainly been shattered for another couple of years. It\u2019s a devastating blow.\u201d Hodgson went on to talk about the \u201celement of risk\u201d that would be attached to selecting Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck in the summer, a statement that is borne out by the amount of football the two forwards have missed since the 2014 World Cup. Sturridge, in particular, needs an injury-free run given that this will be his first start for England since September 2014. Hodgson regards him as the most naturally talented of all his forwards but it is a reflection of Sturridge\u2019s stop-start career that, 27 later this year, the Liverpool striker has not even started 100 Premier League games. A lot of players \u2013 Wayne Rooney, for one \u2013 can be slow to find their best form after injuries but, in Sturridge\u2019s favour, at least that does not seem to be one of his issues. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been out for such a long time the question normally is how quickly a player takes to get back up to speed,\u201d Milner, his team-mate at Liverpool, said. \u201cIt might take weeks, it might take months. For him it seems to take a warm-up. Then he\u2019s straight out there, chopping left to right, beating players, his touch is there, his ability in front of goal. I\u2019ve seen absolutely no change in him at all.\u201d Otherwise the match presents a chance for Danny Drinkwater to try to stand out in the way that Dele Alli and Eric Dier did in Berlin. Drinkwater will make his debut in a vastly changed lineup and the only minor disappointment for the Leicester City player, perhaps, is that it will be in one of the new England kits that has prompted so much criticism. Gary Lineker described the away version as the worst England strip in history during the Germany game and it was intriguing to learn from Hodgson that the players had been consulted about the design \u2013 but that nobody had asked the manager. Hodgson, one imagines, would rather a traditional all-white look for Wembley and the Football Association\u2019s most high\u2011profile employee sounded suspiciously as if he had been briefed what to say when it was put to him that England\u2019s designers had suffered a wardrobe malfunction. \u201cAs far as kits are concerned, the only thing that interests me is the person wearing the shirt,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m happy with the players wearing the shirts, I\u2019m not prepared to enter into a debate on the colours. But I\u2019m happy to let everyone out there have an opinion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
