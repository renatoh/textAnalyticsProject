Dmitry Komar, Ilya Krichevsky and Vladimir Usov died 20 years ago defending the White House \u2013 the Russian parliament \u2013 against troops sent by the GKChP, communist hardliners who had launched a putsch in an attempt to derail Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. Thousands of people converged on their funeral on 24 August 1991, a few days after the coup failed, hastening the breakup of the Soviet Union later that year. Each coffin was transported on the back of a truck piled with flowers to Moscow's Vagankovo cemetery, where busts of the three were erected. Mourners carried large portraits of the martyrs. Yet two decades on, as Russia marks the anniversary of the standoff, Komar, Krichevsky and Usov are all but forgotten. \"My world was destroyed when Dmitry died,\" said Komar's mother Lyubov, 63, in an interview at her home in a Moscow suburb. \"He was my cliff, my warrior, my defender. The Kremlin sent a wreath on the first few anniversaries. Then there was nothing.\" When Gorbachev returned from the Crimean dacha where he was held incommunicado during the coup, he made the three men posthumous Heroes of the Soviet Union for their \"bravery in the defence of democracy\". Their relatives were given free apartments and a pension supplement of 250 roubles per month, then equivalent to a good salary. Lyubov, who works as an administrator in a sports centre, said the payment was raised to 370 roubles in 2002 and has not been increased since, making it now worth \u00a38. After her son's death, she went on two trips to the United States financed by an American NGO, and visited the Pentagon and the White House. A US foundation still sponsors exchange students from Russia in memory of Komar, Krichevsky and Usov, she said. \"They paid more attention to our sons over there than anyone did here. I never heard a word from [Boris] Yeltsin.\" Yeltsin, the then recently appointed president of Russia and a growing rival to the Soviet leader, Gorbachev, provided the lasting image of the coup when he climbed on a tank and called for resistance. \"Boris Yeltsin was our guru in those days,\" said Gennady Veretilny, 52, one of hundreds of civilians who answered the call. \"We thought he would bring us freedom, a new future.\" When Veretilny arrived at the White House on the evening of 20 August other defenders had erected a barricade made from trolleybuses, metal bars and scrap. Soon a column of military vehicles bore down through an underpass. Two defenders scrambled on to an advancing armoured personnel carrier (APC) and tried to cover its slits with a sheet of canvas. One of them, Komar, 22, who had served as a paratrooper in Afghanistan, tried to climb through a hatch and was shot from inside. His body was flung back, and his foot got trapped so that he dangled off the back of the vehicle. Seeing Komar's predicament, Veretilny rushed forward and attempted to drag him free, but he was shot in the shoulder and retreated. \"When the APC stopped, I ran up again but Dmitry's head had been crushed,\" Veretilny remembered this week. Around the same time, a stray bullet killed Usov, 37, an economist who had also approached to help Komar. Krichevsky, 28, an architect, was shot dead as troops escaped from another APC set on fire by demonstrators. Veretilny feels bitter that no one was brought to account for the deaths. \"Those three men spilled their blood for their country,\" he said. \"No one talks of them any more while the soldier who fired from the APC became a general.\" Meanwhile, Krichevsky's sister Marina, 46, also an architect, says she worries her brother's sacrifice will slip from view. \"It was a very important moment in the history of our country and now it seems that it is forgotten more and more. \"Our authorities find it unnecessary to give this attention. It is very sad. I haven't voted for years because of this.\" The neglect has led to calls for Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's president, to visit the three men's graves on Russian Flag Day, which commemorates the end of the coup. \"Nothing could or would be more special and moving for the Russian head of state than to go to Vagankovo cemetery on 22 August and bow in memory of the three young men who died for the cause of Russian freedom,\" wrote political commentator Konstantin von Eggert. Eggert said the trio's memory was fading fast because society had become \"permeated with cynicism and disillusionment\" that contrasted sharply with the idealism of 20 years ago. Lyubov Komar says she does not know if politicians or officials will come to mourn her son on the anniversary: \"I've learned not to expect anything.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 17 August 2011. The original said in the headline it was the 30th anniversary of the Soviet coup, when it should have been the 20th. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
