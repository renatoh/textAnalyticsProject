While the polls showed widely varying results, most showed that the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, had won more votes than the prime minister, Viktor Yanukovich. A poll funded by western embassies said Mr Yushchenko won 45% of the vote and Mr Yanukovich 37%. Another poll put them at 41% and 40%. A Russian-backed poll gave Mr Yanukovich 43% of the vote against 40% for Mr Yushchenko. Oleksandr Zinchenko, the election campaign chief for Mr Yushchenko, said: \"We are sure we got a figure that way exceeds the announcements.\" He said they had gained more than the 50% required to win the first round and may have got up to 60% but claimed there had been a \"total, comprehensive and overall\" falsification of the result by the government. However, the opposition urged the public not to protest against the alleged irregularities for fear of unrest. Large groups milled around the capital's pedestrianised streets waiting for news of the exit polls. The Central Election Commission reportedly asked the prosecutor to investigate claims of irregularities as speculation grew that the government might declare the vote void and introduce a state of emergency. Irina Gerashenko, the press secretary for Mr Yushchenko, said: \"We are absolutely sure that we have won the election in the first round. But there may be a second round. \"A lot depends on the moods and the actions of the people. We want everything to proceed in a legal fashion.\" Any run-off election would be held next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
