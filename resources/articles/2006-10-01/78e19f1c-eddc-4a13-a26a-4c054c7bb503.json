The deal, which is expected to be approved by the supervisory board of the German utility RWE, Thames Water's owner, is valued at \u00a38bn. Macquarie is understood to have outbid the Qatar investment authority to acquire Thames Water, while Guy Hands' investment company, Terra Firma, is also understood to have been a contender. City analysts believe that disappointed bidders for Thames Water will now turn their attention to other companies on the sector in the UK. AWG, which owns Anglian Water, is already the subject of a recommended bid from Australian and Canadian funds, backed by Britain's 3i, while two Australian investment funds have agreed to buy South East Water. UK water companies are increasingly popular targets for overseas institutional investors because the system of economic regulation under which they operate gives them known rates of return over five-year pricing cycles. Severn Trent, Kelda and Tennon are among the water companies seen as possible targets, though some analysts believe valuations in the sector are becoming stretched. Thames is a high-profile acquisition and one which has come under fire because of its leakage rates in the London area, where a combination of ageing pipes and difficult soil conditions have drawn the attention of industry regulator Ofwat. Thames has already pledged to increase its spending to reduce the amount of water lost through leaks. Based in Reading, Thames Water supplies drinking water to 8 million people and sewerage services to 13 million customers. In its regulated business in Britain, the company generated revenues of \u20ac1.9bn (\u00a31.3bn) and an operating result of \u20ac687m in its 2005 financial year. Kemble Water, the consortium led by Macquarie European Infrastructure Funds, bid \u00a34.8bn and agreed to assume \u00a33.2bn of debt to give an implied enterprise value of \u00a38bn. The supervisory board of RWE is due to meet during the coming weekend, and the transaction is expected to close by early December. The Germany company said it expected the transaction to result in a book gain of \"at least in the mid-hundreds of millions of euros\". The deal comprises the activities of Thames Water in the UK and certain international operations. Thames Water's mainland European activities have already been integrated into RWE Energy. \"The divestiture of Thames Water is a major milestone in RWE's strategy to focus on its core strengths and concentrate on the converging European electricity and gas markets,\" said Harry Roels, chief executive of the Germany company. In August Thames Water announced that it was to cut a quarter of its 6,000 staff over the next three years despite missing targets to reduce leaks. A leaked memo from the company's boss, Jeremy Pelczer, warned staff that an efficiency drive would lead to job losses of at least 300 a year with some likely to be compulsory redundancies. Unions criticised the job cuts and said they would jeopardise promises made by Thames to spend \u00a3150m on repairs. In July, Thames Water escaped a fine of up to \u00a366m for failing to meet its targets for reducing leaks, by pledging to spend \u00a3150m of its own money on tackling the problem. Under a legally binding agreement with Ofwat, Thames agreed to replace 230 miles of water mains in London over the next five years in addition to the 770 miles already planned. Backstory Macquarie Bank has ridden the boom created by deregulation of Australia's financial sector. Established as a merchant banking subsidiary of the UK's Hill Samuel in 1970, with just three staff, in 1985 it became only the second retail bank to be established in Australia in the 20th century. Its \"holey dollar\" logo harks back to Sydney's colonial era under governor Lachlan Macquarie but its ambitions focused on the future. In 1996 it listed on the Australian Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of A$1.3bn (\u00a3525m at today's exchange rate) but expanded rapidly. Its overseas ambitions included an unsuccessful \u00a31.5bn bid for the London Stock Exchange last year. It was called in by debt-laden Eurotunnel to work with Goldman Sachs on a refinancing scheme. The 80 or so companies in which it has an interest range from the technology firms to the Bondi Beach railway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
