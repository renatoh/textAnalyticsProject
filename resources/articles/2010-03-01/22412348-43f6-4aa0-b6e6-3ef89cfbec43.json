It was the third 1-1 draw between these sides this season and was a fitting result in a game in which neither fully deserved three points. Warnock's seat in the QPR dugout at Bramall Lane for this match might have been occupied by Kevin Blackwell had Rangers got their desired target last summer. However, given the managerial bloodletting that has taken place at Loftus Road since, Blackwell may consider it fortunate that such a move never materialised and that Warnock, his coach and mentor of 17 years, now occupies the division's most precarious post. Warnock had won both his games in charge of Rangers before this match to reignite long-forgotten play-off aspirations, while Blackwell's team have slipped away from top-six contention after six defeats in nine matches. Yet neither side asserted themselves for much of the first half and chances were sporadic. The first fell to the Rangers striker Taarabt who shot straight at the United goalkeeper Mark Bunn when clean through in the eighth minute. United's Henri Camara blazed over soon afterwards on a swift attack by the home side, though it would have been a controversial goal as Camara had aimed a kick at the Rangers centre-back Damion Stewart in the build-up. Hogan Ephraim saw two good chances go begging for the visitors \u2013 first he hit the post with a cross-cum-shot, then Bunn smothered a later effort \u2013 before United grabbed the lead on the cusp of half-time with a goal the quality of which belied all that had preceded it. Cresswell was the scorer, directing a fizzing header into the top corner of the net from Mark Yeates's cross. United's Dutch defender Marcel Seip was solely culpable for Rangers' equaliser four minutes into the second half. He dawdled on the ball near the centre-circle and was robbed, then outpaced by the spritely Taarabt, who this time had the beating of Bunn. Three minutes later, Taarabt's clever footwork drew a foul on the edge of the area from where he almost made it 2-1, his whipped free-kick being well tipped over. United could have won it at the end though, but their substitute Darius Henderson wasted a simple chance to score when he somehow failed to connect with a piercing cross at the far post as the goal gaped before him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
