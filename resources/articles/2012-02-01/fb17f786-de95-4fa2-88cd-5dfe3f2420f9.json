The Football Association chairman, David Bernstein, the general secretary Alex Horne, the director of football development Sir Trevor Brooking and the Club England managing director Adrian Bevington have cleared their diaries and will spend all day compiling a job description and drawing up a shortlist. Who will decide? Bernstein ruled out using headhunters or running an expansive interview process \u2013 an approach that has backfired in the past. Instead the four members of the Club England board will take a recommendation to the main FA board once they have secured a chosen candidate. What are they looking for? The FA claimed they were looking for a manager who could both lay the foundations for long-term success, with an eye on all the major tournaments running up to the Russian World Cup in 2018, and immediately revitalise the atmosphere around the England camp. \"We are looking for someone who will have the respect of the players, that has a good track record, hopefully someone who will excite and inspire the fans and we believe can play a really important role at St George's Park,\" said Bevington. He also spoke at length about the new man playing a key role in developing England's youth and building better links with club managers. \"Someone who can be a real motivator to the younger players who can send out a real message about how important it is to play for England, someone who can also work closely and have a good relationship with club managers and coaches, maybe invite some people into our international development set up so that we can have a number of managers and coaches and build a pathway there so that we have a long term plan.\" The quartet also attempted to manage expectations, while simultaneously pointing to the success of Spain and Germany in creating a model for success that doesn't need reinventing every time a regime implodes. What is the time frame? Stuart Pearce has been appointed as caretaker manager for the Holland friendly on 29 February and Bernstein repeatedly spoke of not rushing and taking their time. But he also spoke of needing someone in place well before May. March would seem a reasonable aim to secure either a short-term solution for the European Championship or a permanent manager. Is Harry Redknapp a shoo-in? FA executives spent half theirThursday's press conference virtually describing Redknapp \u2013 the new manager should be a popular choice with the fans, know the England squad well, favour attractive football and have a proven track record. But they were also at pains to insist that they would consider other options. Horne spoke of drawing up an \"exhaustive list\" and Bernstein insisted others would not be put off by the fact Redknapp was a clear favourite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
