His team emerged victorious but it did so in such a way that left many French fans with their heads bowed in shame. Amid fears that the touch of Thierry Henry's left hand may have left a permanent stain on the image of the once-mighty Bleus \u2013 and the country they represent \u2013 France is now engaged in a vigorous bout of another favourite sport: intensive and protracted soul-searching. \u2022 Henry tells Ireland: rematch the fairest solution \u2022 Angry Keane turns on FAI and absolves Henry \u2022 Dara O Briain: Thierry, what's French for handball? \u2022 David Lacey: Henry bit the hand that fed him Earlier today, before Fifa ruled out a re-match between the countries, pressure mounted for the home side to be given a chance to beat the Irish fair and square. Christine Lagarde, the finance minister, broke ranks with the government to call for the game to \"perhaps\" be played again. \"If the rules are bad you have to question them,\" she told French radio. Henry himself emerged to echo the appeal. \"Of course the fairest solution would be to replay the game but it is not in my control,\" he said. The front page of Liberation called on France to set the record straight \u2013 this time, it said, \"with no hands\". At a time when citizens have been asked to consider what national identity means to them, Le Parisien wrote: \"The handball of Henry has brought a decisive contribution to the theme 'being French is being ashamed of one's national team'.\" There were some who remained defiant in the face of international and domestic opprobrium. Nicolas Sarkozy kept his distance from the row, apologising to Ireland but insisting he was in no place to judge. And a string of political figures, including Rama Yade, the sports secretary, and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a sixties student leader turned green politician, defended Henry. Today Raymond Domenech, the much-maligned French coach, tried to defend himself, saying he didn't \"understand [his critics'] moralism\". But for most fans the fact remained that this was a moral issue \u2013 not only for the team but for France. For them, it was not just that the players, as Aphatie had predicted, were bad on Wednesday night \u2013 although they were generally acknowledged to have been outplayed by \"the valiant\" Irish. It was that they had scraped through qualification by means of a foul \u2013 and that this foul was then ignored, and defended, by a string of players and politicians. Critics claimed the world would now see les Bleus as a nation of cheats. \"It was a disgrace,\" said Christophe Richert, a radio journalist, dissecting the match in a Parisian bar. \"Is this really the moral example we want to show our children?\" Jacques Attali, a former aide to Francois Mitterrand agreed. \"Football is becoming discredited. People who should be models are saying to young people: 'You have to hit back when you're insulted; you have to cheat when you're not caught'. It's shameful.\" The fact that the controversy was caused by Henry, who has scored more goals for France \u2013 51 \u2013 than any other player in history, was a particularly bitter pill for the French to swallow. Along with players such as Zin\u00e9dine Zidane and Lilian Thuram, the captain plays a symbolic role in the French national consciousness as one of the players who led les Bleus to triumph at the World Cup in 1998. Then the Stade de France echoed with jubilant cheers and claims that the French model of integration had triumphed over immigration concerns: the multiracial \"black, blanc, beur\" line-up that so offended far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was seen as having a moral value that went beyond sporting success. Now, in a France still struggling to tackle racism and poverty, those claims are seen as having been hugely exaggerated. As the government commissions a debate into how immigration affects the national identity, the hope that France had solved its integration problems has long been extinguished. \"It is sad,\" said Attali, \"to see the only remaining member of the team covered in glory in 1998 now accepting that his team will qualify through a handball.\" Henry himself agreed. \"Naturally I feel embarrassed at the way that we won and feel extremely sorry for the Irish who definitely deserve to be in South Africa,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
