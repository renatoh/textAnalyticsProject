Assuming you have any feeling left in your hands, of course. Yes, Beijing 2008 is a button-bashing and joystick-waggling recreation of a selection of Olympic events. Simple button-bashers - sprints, swimming - are complemented by more complex events - gymnastics, judo - and the whole package, while mixed, offers some solid entertainment. Multiplayer is key, though - training up an Olympic team by yourself is oddly soulless, especially if you play locally rather than online. Unfortunately, loading screens and unnecessary pre-event sections break up the flow. Yes, swooping stadium flybys and detailed animations of athletes limbering up may look the part but they become annoying very quickly. A bigger problem is the controllers. The PS3 and 360 pads are simply not up to the waggling/button-mashing that the game requires. Despite this, Beijing 2008 is just about worth persevering with. But if you have a Wii, Mario and Sonic is the one to get."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
