Masterpiece of the week Cephalus and Aurora by Nicolas Poussin, circa 1630 Cupid holds up a portrait of Cephalus\u2019s wife, Procris, to remind him to be faithful. He needs this firming up to resist the advances of Aurora, goddess of dawn. It\u2019s a mythological image of seduction and fidelity that Poussin, a French immigrant to Italy stunned by the classical heritage of Rome, renders both entertaining and moralistic. Yet the triviality of the tale is transcended and transformed by his sublime depiction of a blazing sky and an earth kissed by its light. This grand luminosity turns a simple scene into a history that glows with enigmatic importance. \u2022 National Gallery, London.

This image is from his first major UK exhibition, which opened at Tate Liverpool this week. Read the review here.
