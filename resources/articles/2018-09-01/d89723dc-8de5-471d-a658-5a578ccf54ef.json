There\u2019s a template there now for how to prepare for a World Cup. How many friendlies you\u2019ve got to play against certain opposition at a certain level and how you behave and how you interact with the fans. \u201cYou saw what Gareth did in the summer, probably our biggest success was what happened off the field as much as what happened on it. In terms of engagement with the media and the fans.\u201d This week, the FA submitted a bid to host the 2021 European Championship and Neville said missing out on the finals in France would have been a huge setback. \u201cEven going to a play-off would have sent the wrong message. I\u2019ve put myself under a lot of pressure with the fact that I want to win a World Cup, so if we\u2019d slipped up tonight it would have been a massive blow for everybody.\u201d With friendlies against Brazil and Australia \u2013 at Notts County and Fulham \u2013 secured and a trip to the Netherlands and a possible visit of Sweden lined up, Neville said thinking ahead is important: \u201cI spoke to Gareth when he came back and said we\u2019re not planning anything until after Wales. He said: \u2018Phil iIf I was you, I would start planning now because it soon catches up on you.\u2019\u201d Neville feels he has answered his critics and developed a passion for his team that he hopes will drive them towards success. \u201cFor me I\u2019ve got to win games and I\u2019ve done that. When I took over people said I didn\u2019t know anything about the women\u2019s game and I didn\u2019t know how to cope with female footballers. \u201cI think from day one I\u2019ve put that to bed and I\u2019ve used that as my motivation. Every time we win a game it\u2019s another box ticked. I\u2019ve embraced this. You know when you hear Klopp, Jos\u00e9 and Poch [Mauricio Pochettino] say they love their players? I do. I love working in the women\u2019s game and my players are like my family now and it\u2019s special.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
