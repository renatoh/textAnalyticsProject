Not just the rotten ones, some good ones too. Companies like HJ Berry, a traditional wooden chair manufacturer in the Pennines; and Chunk of Devon which, much to the embarrassment of rivals across the border in Cornwall, recently won best pasty at the British Pie Awards (like the Baftas, but for pies). Now though, the order books aren't even half-full, sales are down, the bank is banging at the door. It's time to throw in the towel. But wait, here's one last chance: Sir Gerry Robinson, a knight in a shiny Jaguar. We see a lot of that car, purring to the rescue. And a lot of Sir Gerry's lovely Georgian country pile, too \u2013 extensive grounds, a driveway that goes on for ever, the lake. Is that a maze? Nice. The message is clear: this fella's done well. I forget what exactly it is he did, apart from being called \"an ignorant upstart caterer\" by John Cleese when he took over at Granada, and once getting Ali G-ed. But he's obviously seriously minted. Now Gerry's Big Decision (Channel 4) is whether to help save these ailing firms, with some of his trouble-shooting know-how and a nice little investment of his own moolah. A very nice one in the case of HJ Berry, which needs a million to stop it from going under. So he has a snoop around in Lancashire and Devon, chatting to everyone, from the bosses down to the people who fill the pies and shape the chair legs. They're great products, both of them: solid and traditional, meaty and tasty. Management, that's the problem, there's no clear leadership. And the sales effort is a disgrace; it always is. So Gerry wrestles with his soul. His gut tells him to turn that shiny Jaguar around and drive away. But these are good products, and good people, their houses and futures are on the line. In the case of HJ Berry, a whole community depends on its survival. In the end, Gerry invests in both of them. He gives \u00a385,000 to the couple who make the pies, and a million to the chair-maker. There are tears, hugs, and promises. He's not just a knight, he's practically the Archangel Gabriel, sent by God himself. Gerry did once almost become a priest. Of course, he does now own 51% of both companies. So Chunk (one couple's dream and baby) and HJ Berry (which has been owned and run by the same family for five generations) are now controlled by Gerry Robinson. To do with as he likes. I don't understand business enough to know whether he really is a knight \u2013 or a circling vulture, swooping down to pick out the eyeballs of animals that aren't yet dead, but are so confused and disorientated they thank him for it. Somewhere between the two, is my guess. I am pretty sure you don't drop out of priest school, and get a driveway as long as that, through altruism alone. To be honest, I think I'd rather be rescued by David Taylor, whose job is also to sort out ailing companies. David is a top business psychologist, and his mission is to remove the jargon, the mystery and the hype from business. And the clothes \u2013 because this is The Naked Office (Virgin 1). Seriously. He's called into this Newcastle advertising agency that hasn't been doing so well lately. It's the same problems that Sir Gerry faced \u2013 poor management, badly defined roles, no clear leadership, all of that. But instead of buying them, he gives them a week of team-building exercises, culminating in a day of nudity. Extreme dress-down Friday. It helps to build trust apparently, at a very deep level. They do it, too; well, most of them. The boss even drives to work in the buff. Hats \u2013 and everything else \u2013 off to him. Sam the receptionist hardly thinks twice about it, just peels all her clothes off. But then I suppose this is Newcastle, where ladies don't wear clothes out on a Friday night, even in winter, so coming to the office in the nude isn't such a big leap. It works, too. Well, I don't know about the figures (the numbers sort, I mean), but they seem to be getting along much better. It's certainly more entertaining to watch than Gerry the Pious. I've actually decided to adopt it here, at the offices of the Guardian. I'm not sure my colleagues have realised yet, they probably think I've just taken my shirt off, because I'm hot. Guys, hello, it's not just the top half. No, it's OK, it's recommended by top management gurus. Get involved, all of you.
