United have spurned chances in a run of uneven form in which they have drawn twice and lost once since the opening 4-0 win over Chelsea. Rashford and Martial, who is injured, have each scored twice this season. The former has 29 league goals in 115 appearances, the latter 36 in 116 for the club. United host Leicester City on Saturday. Solskj\u00e6r was asked what ratio Rashford and Martial needed. \u201cYou have 38 [league] games, so if you can have 19 goals [each] as a partnership, with those two, so around 40 goals, that\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not top, top class,\u201d said the manager. \u201cAt the moment, Dan [James] has got three, Marcus and Anthony have got two each, and that\u2019s in our four games, and Anthony only played three of them, so he\u2019s improving. \u201c[To become better] it\u2019s anticipation, knowing which position you\u2019re in, because the quality is there, definitely, and we\u2019re learning where to run, when to run, how to run, and the last finish, they\u2019ve go to do, of course. \u201cThey\u2019re practising all the time and hopefully we can see Dan and Marcus getting goals this week, and Anthony can come next week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
