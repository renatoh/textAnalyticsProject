Do you: a) have a big row and walk out; b) sulk for a week or two; or c) find a hooker who looks like Emmanuelle B\u00e9art and pay her to seduce him? The answer, in Nathalie, is c), a solution most husbands would settle for, and the upshot is that B\u00e9art spends most of the film giving graphic sexual descriptions to cuckolded wife Fanny Ardant. Since we never see husband G\u00e9rard Depardieu doing the aforementioned acts, you wonder how realistic these decriptions are, and this keeps a very odd film reasonably interesting, though for some B\u00e9art pouting her way through what sounds like the letters page of a porn mag will be enough. The film doesn't seem to be trying for realism in any area - the brothel where Ardant runs into B\u00e9art is red from ceiling to floor, and Ardant's occupation is gynaecologist. There's also a would-be wooer of Ardant whose date music is Joy Division. It's halfway to a blatant parody like 8 Women, in which both actresses recently appeared."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
