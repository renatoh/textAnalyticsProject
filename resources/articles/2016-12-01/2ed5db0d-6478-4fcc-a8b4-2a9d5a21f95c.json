Dispatched to Humberside on loan by Southampton two years ago, the Uruguayan struggled with injuries and poor form, and it took a transfer to Teesside to help restore him to former glories. And Ram\u00edrez, once again emphasising his importance to Aitor Karanka\u2019s gameplan, headed in a winner to lift Middlesbrough four points clear of the relegation zone and towards mid-table security. It left an unambitious Hull, who restricted a dominant Boro to few clear-cut chances but created next to none of their own, second from bottom and heading into a bitter night with their future as unclear as the fog-shrouded roads leading south to Humberside. \u201cWe controlled the game,\u201d said Karanka, for whom it was only a third victory of the season. \u201cIt was a really good win, beating Hull was massive. They\u2019re really well organised but we showed we were better than them.\u201d Phelan did not entirely disagree. \u201cWe were under severe pressure but I thought we defended well,\u201d the Hull manager said. \u201cWith better decision-making we could possibly have got a point.\u201d As the mist began rolling in from the Tees, a cagey opening filled with backwards and sideways passes was briefly enlivened when \u00c1lvaro Negredo met Marten de Roon\u2019s lay-off. Twelve yards out, the striker was slackly marked but, perhaps unwisely, he elected to shoot with the outside of his left foot when he seemed to have time to shift it on to the right. Unsurprisingly, the shot arced high over the bar. David Marshall, Hull\u2019s keeper, has one of V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s\u2019s old Barcelona jerseys hidden away in his garage. It is a souvenir from the night in 2004 the then youthful Celtic keeper was part of the team who won a Uefa Cup match against Bar\u00e7a, and he seemed minded to perform a few more heroics here. Having reacted well to save Ram\u00edrez\u2019s low 25-yard shot and then divert a similar effort from Adam Forshaw, he initially proved adept at it. Boro\u2019s improvement in recent weeks has been largely attributable to Karanka\u2019s installation of his other Barcelona old boy, Adama Traor\u00e9, wide on the right, and the winger\u2019s demotion to the bench raised eyebrows. His place was taken by Viktor Fischer, who thought he had scored after turning the ball home following Ram\u00edrez\u2019s cross and Negredo\u2019s headed flick only to see the effort rightly disallowed for a combination of offside and handball. No matter; Karanka\u2019s players were very much in control. They appeared almost affronted when Hull finally escaped their half and looked unprepared for Adama Diomand\u00e9\u2019s acceleration on to Markus Henriksen\u2019s pass. Then, just as Diomand\u00e9, shaped to shoot, Ben Gibson slid in to retrieve the situation with a perfectly timed, brilliantly executed tackle. \u201cBen Gibson, he\u2019s one of our own,\u201d chorused the Teesside crowd as Steve Gibson, the club\u2019s owner and the centre-half\u2019s uncle, looked on approvingly. Behind the smiles, Gibson Sr might have been a little concerned by Boro\u2019s failure to translate superiority into goals, the moment when Fischer\u2019s inviting delivery struck a startled Negredo on the side of the head seeming symbolic of their attacking travails. Significantly, that was a rare cross from a home player and maybe a few more would not have gone amiss. Possibly this dearth of centres was down to Ram\u00edrez being used as much more of a playmaking No10 than a winger. It also had something to do with Fischer\u2019s struggles to get beyond Ahmed Elmohamady but philosophy comes into it too; Karanka wants to play in a more between-the-lines way. On Monday, though, Hull\u2019s five-man midfield made fluency difficult in the freezing air, though the game finally defrosted 15 minutes into a second half full of home dominance when a set piece rescued Boro. Fischer\u2019s corner found Ram\u00edrez totally unmarked at the far post and his glancing header defied Marshall. Industry personified, the Uruguayan deserved his moment. Phelan\u2019s side immediately became more expansive after Ryan Mason and Jake Livermore were withdrawn and Tom Huddlestone and the young Jarrod Bowen were introduced. And after Ram\u00edrez hobbled off with a minor injury, Hull suddenly prompted panic for Boro. Their new-found sense of adventure resulted in Vald\u00e9s saving brilliantly from Diomand\u00e9 in stoppage time. Connecting with Robert Snodgrass\u2019s ensuing corner, the lone striker then poked the ball narrowly wide. Next Vald\u00e9s directed a clearance straight at Snodgrass but he could not quite take advantage. \u201cWe don\u2019t have great resources,\u201d Phelan said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be difficult \u2013 but this will not kill our sense of belief.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
