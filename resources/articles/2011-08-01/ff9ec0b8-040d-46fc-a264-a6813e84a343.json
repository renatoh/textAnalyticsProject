In the emergency House of Commons debate on the riots last Thursday, David Cameron told MPs that the outbreak of anarchy and lawlessness was \"criminality, pure and simple. And there is absolutely no excuse for it\". As if to drive home the point that personal moral failings were at the heart of the spiralling disorder, much of the media has focused on the apparently comfortable backgrounds of those appearing in court: a \"ballerina\" allegedly caught on camera as an electronics store in Croydon was looted; a 2012 Olympic ambassador who is accused of participating in the trashing of a Vodafone store; a primary-school teaching mentor covering his face with shame as he entered a magistrates court in north London. The message was: these are not the representatives of a deprived underclass. They are individuals who, somewhere between last Saturday and last Tuesday night, lost their moral compass, as did thousands of others. The desire to call a crime a crime is understandable and right. Who would deny that the looters, muggers and fire raisers of last week were engaged in appalling acts of illegality and many richly deserve the severe consequences that will follow? The former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was misguided in his attempt to link the disorder to the coalition's programme of cuts. The closure of libraries and youth centres in Haringey did not cause hundreds of young men to hijack a peaceful protest at the police shooting of Mark Duggan, leading to hours of mayhem. The actions of shocking numbers of people were frightening, disturbing and wrong and, tragically, led to the death of five people. But it is not good enough for British society to condemn, convict, and then carry on, hopeful that an eruption of inexplicable malfeasance has been contained and suppressed. Pace MacKenzie, we do need to try to \"understand\" what happened. To be fair to Mr Cameron, he clearly recognises this. In his statement to the Commons, the prime minister declared his determination to deal with the \"deeper problems\" that led to last week's scarcely believable sequence of events. Crucially, he said, the gang culture that infests swathes of the most beleaguered estates in England must be undermined. Among the other solutions mentioned are the reform of the benefit system to drive people back into work; greater discipline in schools and a sentencing regime that will \"score a clear, heavy line between right and wrong\". Some of the more outlandish proposals, such as evicting families of rioters from their homes, are likely to be quietly buried once the furore dies down. But Mr Cameron's immediate prescriptions and priorities are revealing. Quite evidently, his is a post-riot plan for dealing with the problems of Britain's poor. The schools of which the prime minister is thinking are not generally in leafy suburbs, or in England's more prosperous towns. Nor are most of the jobless who, he says, need to be incentivised back to work. The population of Britain's prisons is overwhelmingly poor and disproportionately black. So when it comes to policy focus, Mr Cameron acknowledges what so many of his supporters seemed determined to deny: economic exclusion, deprivation, call it what you will \u2013 this had something to do with the riots. It is the right conclusion: according to one recent study, the London boroughs of Haringey, Hackney and Lewisham \u2013 three areas worst affected by rioting \u2013 have the highest ratio of claimants on jobseeker's allowance in England. The Office for National Statistics reveals that almost 36% of Lewisham's 16-24-year-olds were unemployed last year, against a UK average of 19.5%. In Haringey, 54 people chase every job going. Can anyone seriously make the argument that these statistics and other indices like them have nothing to do with what happened? Why are poor people so much more likely to be bad as well? A connection is not an explanation. Those who looted, vandalised and terrorised in London, Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham were in a tiny minority. The subsequent reaction of their neighbours has lifted the heart. The whip-rounds organised in local communities have moved the owners of looted shops to tears. The clean-ups and the T-shirts stating \"I love Hackney\" testify to something very close to the spirit of the \"big society\" that Mr Cameron has struggled for so long to define. So what made a minority tear up the social rules that governs our everyday lives? What persuaded them \u2013 lack of police numbers and preparedness aside \u2013 to rip up the rules? Over the past days, there have been many attempted comparisons between the riots of 2011 and those of the early 1980s, when Toxteth in Liverpool, St Pauls in Bristol and Brixton in London were in flames. But perhaps the more relevant precedent took place on the west coast of America in 1992. The Los Angeles riots of that year were sparked by the acquittal of three LAPD officers who had been videoed while handing out a savage beating to Rodney King, a black motorist. The perceived racism of both the attack and the subsequent verdict was the catalyst for the protests and violence that enveloped South Central LA. But the riots also turned into something more anarchic as widespread looting took over. At the time, Newsweek magazine described the mood on the streets as close to \"a manic fiesta, a TV game show with every looter a winner\". There was something of that in London's looted streets last week: these were riots that bore the imprint of a consumer culture that has increasingly determined ideas of status and achievement in Britain. The \"cause\" that united many of the rioters was the liberation of desirable \"free stuff\" from Foot Locker and Vodafone. A riot became a festival of illegal consumption as, in an adrenaline-fuelled frenzy, gang members lines up alongside ordinary teenagers and simply helped themselves. This is not how social contract theory is supposed to work. Societies function and flourish according to a kind of grand bargain between governors and governed about how we go on. Last week we discovered to our horror, that large numbers of our fellow citizens have no stake in that bargain and given the opportunity, will trash the principles on which it is based. Again, we badly need to understand why. The answer \u2013 or a big part of it \u2013 surely lies in a growing sense that, whatever George Osborne claims about us \"all being in it together\", most people in Britain are, too much of the time, only \"in it\" for themselves. The ideas of fairness and equal opportunity are buzzwords on the lips of politicians of every stripe. But the hard evidence of the self-interested behaviour and blatant inequality of life-chances mounts up. From various recent studies we have learned that inequality of income over the past three decades has actually risen, after steadily falling from the second world war to the 1970s. Meanwhile social mobility has fallen. A Sutton Trust analysis showed that just five schools, among them Westminster, Eton, St Paul's, and St Paul's Girls' School, provided more Oxbridge entrants than 2,000 lower-performing state schools combined. Philip Pullman, Greg Dyke and others have called for a \"public jury\" to scrutinise the practices of what they described as a monied \"feral elite\" who have corrupted the public realm. The list included the bankers who nearly ruined the British economy yet continue to draw multi-million pound bonuses; the MPs and their cosy expenses arrangements; and the media empires whose abuse of power has come to light in the phone-hacking scandal. The feral elite was quickly supplanted in public disapprobation by the \"feral rats\", as one shop owner described them, who ran amok last week. But these two constituencies, residing at opposite ends of Britain's social spectrum, share one important characteristic: a culpable irresponsibility and feckless disregard for principles of justice and equity. When a society's instincts for the good have been corroded by the sight of bankers trousering bonuses that dwarf the lifetime salary of an average employee, or by the rise of a super-rich City-based clique which threatens to leave for somewhere more congenial when asked to contribute taxes, is it so much of a surprise that the people occupying the bottom rungs of the ladder start behaving badly too? London is a city in which the rich live alongside the poor and from the perspective of those at the bottom of the heap, the repeated invocations of fairness by politicians can look like so much hypocrisy and cant. And when so many people feel excluded, a violent minority may try and force their way into the main event. It has been right to emphasise that what took place last week was \"criminality\". But the leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband, was also right when he said that the best route to avoiding repetitions of last week's scenes lies in a new ethic of responsibility, one that is needed \"from top to bottom in our society\". The Labour leader also condemned \"the take what you can culture,\" saying \"that needs to change from the benefits office to the boardroom\". Again, he is right. Blaming a \"mindless minority\" of thugs for scenes that shocked the world and confounded our idea of what England is and how it works is not good enough. The looters and arsonists must be charged and convicted. But we must resist any attempt to create an enemy within dealt with by a more politicised police force. Instead the rest of us must attempt to make sure that never again will people feel such contempt for the communities they live in. In the battle to restore England's tattered social fabric, we really are all in it together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
