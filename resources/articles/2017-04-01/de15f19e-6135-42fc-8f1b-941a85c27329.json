The Refugee Council of Australia argues older refugees, and those who\u2019ve arrived from conflict zones with disrupted educations, would find the strengthened English requirement hardest. \u201cWhile the overwhelming majority of refugee and humanitarian entrants are children and young people who typically learn English quickly, those brought to Australia as refugees include some older adults, torture survivors and people with disabilities who struggle to master English. These are the people who are most likely to miss out on citizenship under the changes being planned by the government,\u201d the RCOA chief executive, Paul Power, said. \u201cThe sad irony is that people who have come to Australia as refugees value the freedom and security associated with Australian citizenship more highly than any other group in the nation.\u201d Power said the proposed changes to the citizenship test would not achieve what the government has said it is aiming to do. \u201cNo extremist or terrorist is going to be unearthed by a few questions about values. But the person who will struggle will be the 45-year-old Sudanese mother, who has come to Australia as a refugee, who has had a disrupted, if any, formal education, and is struggling in adulthood to learn a fourth language.\u201d Department of Immigration and Border Protection statistics reveal refugees apply for citizenship at a higher rate than any other migrant group. But they also fail the test at a far higher rate \u2013 refugees have a failure rate of about 8.8% , six times the rate of 1.4% for other categories of migrants. On average, a refugee needs to attempt the citizenship test 2.4 times, double the average for all migrants of 1.2 times. Announcing the changes, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said speaking English was a key element of successfully integrating into Australia. \u201cI reckon if we went out today and said to Australians \u2018Do you think you could become an Australian citizen without being able to speak English?\u2019 They\u2019d say \u2018You\u2019re kidding. Surely you\u2019d have to be able to speak [English]\u2019, most people would be surprised that this has not been the law for years and it\u2019s fundamental.\u201d Citizenship already has a \u201cbasic\u201d English test requirement, that will be strengthened to a \u201ccompetent\u201d level assessed by an independent, accredited organisation. Henry Sherrell, researcher at the ANU\u2019s Crawford School of Public Policy, said the proposed new English language requirement would be a serious barrier to citizenship, particularly for refugees and people in Australia on family visas or the spouses of skilled migrants. He said the proposed new English level, the equivalent English proficiency of some university entrance requirements, was too high. \u201cMigrants want to learn English. They want to work. However, not every single newcomer to Australia is in the position to achieve this level of English. This represents a fundamental change to citizenship in Australia with enormous consequences.\u201d In 2008, one of Australia\u2019s most senior diplomats, Richard Woolcott, reviewed the citizenship test, which had only been introduced the year before. He found it was \u201cflawed, intimidating to some, and discriminatory\u201d and needed significant reform. \u201cAlternative and improved education pathways to acquire citizenship need to be established for different categories of people seeking citizenship. \u201cThe special situations of refugee and humanitarian entrants and other disadvantaged and vulnerable people seeking citizenship must be addressed.\u201d The test underwent minor changes in 2009. The citizenship test currently has exemptions for people aged over 60 or with significant disabilities. A government discussion paper on the proposed citizenship test changes, released on Thursday, mentions these exemptions and indicates that they will continue. Refugees already in the country face substantial \u2013 in some cases illegal \u2013 barriers to becoming citizens. More than 10,000 potential citizens who have completed all the requirements for citizenship, including passing the test, and are awaiting only a ceremony to confer citizenship. In December last year, the federal court ruled the government had acted illegally in putting valid citizenship applications from refugees who\u2019d arrived in the country by boat \u201cin a drawer\u201d \u2013 either physical or metaphorical called the \u201cundocumented arrivals drawer\u201d \u2013 and refusing to process them. The government revealed in court there were 10,231 people who had qualified for citizenship who were living in limbo unsure, when, if ever they would be granted citizenship. Some had been invited to ceremonies only to be told by text message the night before that they would not be made citizens. Justice Mordecai Bromberg ordered the department to re-process the applications of the two refugees brought as test cases before the court, and the department is evaluating the others still waiting on a citizenship ceremony."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
