A Coastguard helicopter winched 11 members of the public and two members of staff from the 53-metre (153ft)-high attraction. Dorset and Wiltshire fire and rescue service was called to the scene just after 4.10pm on Tuesday afternoon after engineers\u2019 efforts to free the stuck gondola failed. Firefighters ascended the tower to provide support and reassurance , the service said in a statement. It said most rescue options were discounted on the grounds of safety owing to the weather, adding: \u201cAt approximately 7.30pm, the Coastguard helicopter started to winch those trapped to safety. \u201cArrangements have been made to provide them with a safe place to rest and recover once returned to the ground.\u201d The Jurrasic Skyline tower offers a 360-degree panoramic view of Weymouth and the Jurassic coast.
