Unlike Tinariwen, the best-known Tuareg exponents of the music of the southern Sahara, he's not from northern Mali, but from Niger, to the east; and he is being promoted as a soloist rather than as part of a band, with his latest album produced in Nashville by Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. This ought to be desert blues set with a difference, but what's surprising is that it should be so unremarkable. It's a pleasant, if limited set, and though there are echoes of the mesmeric style of Tinariwen, he sounds more like the attacking Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 with less ambitious guitar work. There are sturdy, repeated riffs, as on the opening Amidinine, and he's at his best when he calms down for loping, melodic songs such as Imidiwan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
