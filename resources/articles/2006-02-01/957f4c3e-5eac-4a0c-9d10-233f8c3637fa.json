Caution is in order, not least because a previous set of abuse pictures turned out to be fakes. But the ministry of defence was right to promise a speedy investigation of these allegations. The images were quickly broadcast on TV across the Arab and Muslim worlds, a grim addition to a catalogue of violence that for many represents an indictment of western policy in the region. British troops in helmets and camouflage kit don't look much different from Americans in Falluja or Israelis in Gaza. Three NCOs were convicted of assaulting prisoners last year, but there is little comfort in the fact that nothing attributed to UK personnel has yet plumbed the depths of depravity that has come to light in US-run facilities such as Abu Ghraib prison and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The effect is cumulative and damaging. With tempers running high over the Danish cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, this is very bad news. Another sad conclusion is that it is time to junk the flattering self-image of British troops as a caring combination of the peace corps, boy scouts and community policemen, based on the Northern Ireland habit of being kind to children and wearing berets rather than steel helmets when security permits. As one expert pointed out, Belfast and Basra - especially since Iraq's second city became a volatile stronghold for Iranian-backed fundamentalist Shia radicals - have little in common except the fact that they both begin with the letter B. Official responses from Tony Blair downwards were quick to note that of the 80,000 British personnel who have now served in Iraq only a tiny handful have committed any crimes. Still, even isolated \"rogue\" breaches of military law and international conventions echo loudly. The war in Iraq remains bitterly divisive and British troops will be there for many more months while larger numbers are heading for dangerous, dangerously undefined and open-ended duty in Afghanistan. Even for those who believe that UK forces in Basra are helping bring forth something better than Ba'athist tyranny - and can still convince themselves that winning hearts and minds really means something - such gratuitous violence is as shameful as it is unacceptable. Punishment of all those responsible must be swift, severe and exemplary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
