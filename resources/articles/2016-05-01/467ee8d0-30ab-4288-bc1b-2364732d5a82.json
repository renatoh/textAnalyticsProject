Researchers at HelpAge International surveyed 300 people older than 60 in Lebanon, South Sudan and Ukraine \u2013 a small sample of people affected by the humanitarian crises occurring globally. They found that the majority had not been consulted about their needs and weren\u2019t aware of available support. Warda, an 85-year-old Syrian woman living in Lebanon, said even when she was aware of assistance, it remained beyond her reach. \u201cI know that humanitarian aid might be helping, but only for those who can go and get it. How am I supposed to get this help if I can\u2019t even leave the room?\u201d The research found 95% of those surveyed in Lebanon, 93% in South Sudan and 66% in Ukraine had not been consulted about their needs, apart from HelpAge\u2019s intervention. An 85-year-old woman in South Sudan echoed the concerns raised, saying: \u201cNo one talks to me to find out what I am going through.\u201d The survey was conducted in the lead-up to this month\u2019s world humanitarian summit in Istanbul, which aims to build momentum for a reformed humanitarian system. The UN says the summit provides the first test of its global commitment to leave no one behind, including older people who have been historically sidelined in humanitarian responses. Older people are disproportionately vulnerable in natural disasters. When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, 75% of those who died were older than 60, despite older people making up only 16% of the population. Similarly, 56% of those who died after the Japan earthquake and tsunami (pdf) in 2011 were aged 65 or over; 23% of the population fall into that age range. HelpAge said older people receive little targeted attention from governments and aid providers. \u201cTo address the neglect faced by older people in conflicts and disasters, their opinions must be heard and changes made in the humanitarian system,\u201d said Frances Stevenson, head of the humanitarian team at HelpAge International. People surveyed also spoke of their need for better healthcare during crises. More than two-thirds of people had more than one chronic health condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis \u2013 making it difficult for them to seek help. Salwa, a 60-year-old Syrian woman living in Lebanon, said there was no specific aid available to meet her health needs. \u201cA year and a half ago I started going blind in one eye and then the other. Now I\u2019m almost completely blind. I don\u2019t want food; I\u2019d even live in the streets. I just want to be able to see,\u201d she said. The report recommends that humanitarian groups address gaps in healthcare services for those with chronic diseases, ensure older people have access to services for psychological distress, ensure the views of older people are reflected and collect better data to reflect their concerns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
