I get up around 7am, sniffing the air. Sometimes even through closed windows you can smell how bad it is, but today it\u2019s hard to tell. I pad through the quiet house to peer out of the glass kitchen door at the sky: it\u2019s cloudless, a fine pale yellow. Some days the light is deep orange, a colour so striking that only a few weeks ago I\u2019d be compelled to snap a photo \u2013 but now it\u2019s horribly familiar. When it\u2019s that colour, you don\u2019t open the door. And you double back through the house to make sure every window is tightly sealed. Today though, I step outside and take a (shallow) breath. Not too bad. In our tiny courtyard the smoke is not actually visible right now, but it still takes a few little forays, stepping back indoors and out again, to determine whether the smell is worse inside the house or out. This morning, outside seems marginally better, so it\u2019s time to move through the house, opening all the windows and doors, turning the ceiling fans up high. With luck we\u2019ll get a bit of \u201cfresh\u201d air throughout in the next hour or so, before the smoke returns. Next, I check the wet laundry waiting in the basket \u2013 it smells mouldy now after a couple of days, so I shove it back in the machine for another wash. Maybe today we\u2019ll be able to hang it outside. But even then we\u2019ll likely have to wash it again anyway. The smell seems impossible to banish. As I open our windows this morning, the birds are squawking like crazy in the eucalypts beyond our fence \u2013 another good sign. On the worst days there\u2019s a menacing quiet. But I can still taste smoke in the back of my mouth, and the heaviness in my lungs remains. In recent years I\u2019ve largely grown out of my lifelong asthma, using medication only once or twice a month. Now I\u2019m using my reliever several times a day. The health department urges asthmatics to stay indoors, not to breathe outside if you can possibly help it, and warns everyone against exercising outdoors. It\u2019s bizarre to see people ignoring this advice, keeping up their boxing routines in the park, cheerlessly punching at each other through the haze. Almost as surreal is walking past two men one evening outside a pub, standing in the thick smoke, smoking. I feel as though I\u2019ve lost my ability to taste or smell anything but smoke. And oddly it doesn\u2019t even seem to smell like smoke anymore; just an acrid, chemical, horrible odour in my clothes, my hair, the sofa, the pillows. One morning I dress in clean clothes and walk 300 metres to the shopping mall across the road from my house. The pharmacy, where I\u2019m buying a new Ventolin, is deep inside, away from the entrance. But still the cashier wrinkles her nose. \u201cI can smell it on you,\u201d she says. A Blue Mountains pal receives messages from concerned friends in the city. Her family lives 6km from one of the 150 fires burning throughout the state. Later we learn this fire has taken out 20% of the world heritage-listed national park, but when I speak to her the wind direction is away from her town. Impossibly, their sky is pure blue. When her husband returns from an appointment in the city though, she texts me later: \u201cHe smells like a barbecue.\u201d On one of the worst days, a friend tells me, Manly was filled with the noise of sirens as city fire trucks attended false emergencies: smoke alarms in houses and businesses were going off all day. Another friend swims daily at an eastern suburbs harbour beach famous for its crystal-clear water. Now she gets out of the water to find her skin flecked with fine ash. We Sydneysiders are learning strange new symbols and language. Our weather apps now carry dotted lines across the shining sun: smoke haze. We learn the meaning of \u201ctemperature inversion\u201d, in which warm air traps cool \u2013 and smoke \u2013 beneath it; our weather reports now carry air quality ratings. For the past month they\u2019ve ranged from \u201cpoor\u201d to well beyond \u201chazardous\u201d. In news updates about the fires, it\u2019s now commonplace to hear two horrific phrases: \u201cseek shelter\u201d and \u201ctoo late to leave\u201d. In the inner city, people wear face masks to go about their business. In the first days of the smoke, a visiting tourist wearing a large black face mask was vox-popped on television. He\u2019d bought the mask for his trip to China, the American explained, but didn\u2019t need it there. He hadn\u2019t expected to wear it peering through the haze at the Sydney Opera House. Facebook chatter shifts from amused sightings of masks to suggestions of where to buy them, to resignation: they don\u2019t work anyway. They might help your mood, but they\u2019ll do nothing to stop the microscopic particles entering your lungs, unless they\u2019re rated P2 and have super suction around the face. Despite this, I can\u2019t help covering my mouth and nose for the few steps to and from the car. I haven\u2019t taken a train or bus in weeks; too much walking involved. The fire danger warnings have a new category. Colours at the low-danger end are green, moving through yellow and orange. The new one is a deep, malevolent red with black stripes, and it\u2019s called \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. On the first catastrophic warning day there\u2019s a palpable fear, because even expert firefighters have never seen anything like this. The winds are completely unpredictable. Nobody knows what will happen. At first we watch the footage \u2013 those walls of orange flame storeys high \u2013 with our hands over our mouths. Money floods in to emergency relief funds to support \u201cthe fireys\u201d, the koala rescuers. But as the days and weeks pass, here in Sydney the mood changes from disbelief to hypervigilant fear to a kind of WTF petulance. It\u2019s still happening? We\u2019re used to turning our attention briefly, intensely, to \u201cthose poor people\u201d affected by climate change, then returning to normal life. Now those poor people include us. Internet fights break out over whether it\u2019s obscene to complain about the smoke. Of course it is; we\u2019re lucky, we of the middle-class inner city. I can afford to buy a new Ventolin once a week, for example. I have time to do each load of laundry thrice before it smells clean. My work doesn\u2019t force me to remain outside, breathing in this shit all day long. And of course, no fires have visited inner Sydney. None of ours are among the 600-plus homes burnt to the ground. None of us are among the dead. But also: it isn\u2019t obscene to find this intolerable. It is intolerable. After our petulance comes a stoic, patient reasoning. It\u2019s good for us to get this wake-up call. And it\u2019ll be over soon. But that was weeks ago, and the patience has been replaced by a grim, creeping dread. A fear that it won\u2019t be over soon, or ever. It feels like karma. This is what the scientists have warned us about, begged us to think of, all these years. It\u2019s here. And it\u2019s going to get worse. We have the \u201cFires Near Me\u201d app on our phones now, but I\u2019m careful not to zoom out too far from our immediate 50km zone. If you do, it\u2019s easy to panic. There are so many little fire symbols they overlap. Weeks after they began, almost half are still classed \u201cout of control\u201d. And zooming out brings the existential horror of what all this really means. It also brings shame, at how we city dwellers have managed to ignore what people in the regions have endured for years now. Even as we\u2019ve written the letters, donated the money and attended the protests about the towns without water, the massive fish kills, the dust storms, the extinctions. Even if we\u2019ve attended to all this in our minds, there\u2019s nothing like going to sleep with the taste of ash in your throat to give you an actual, physiological understanding of real fear. I speak with a psychologist friend who lives in the far west of New South Wales, on a rural property. The fires are not close to her \u2013 yet \u2013 but the fear certainly is. Her dining table carries a thick layer of dust that\u2019s been there for weeks. \u201cAt some point I\u2019ll clean it off, but with two or three huge dust storms a week, there seems little point,\u201d she says. A few weeks ago she drove into \u201ca dust blizzard\u201d with visibility of a few metres, terrified, unable to stop in case another car was behind her. As conservationists, she and her partner do not stock their land and have always prided themselves on total groundcover. But now, with paddocks \u201cshaved\u201d by hordes of hungry kangaroos, exposed soil is everywhere. Rain is a distant memory. \u201cThis is how deserts form,\u201d she said. Her daughters, in their early 20s, decided some time ago not to have children. A few days ago, on the worst day here, I lay on my bed in the afternoon. My lung cobwebs felt specially heavy, the sinus headache intense. Outside, despite daylight saving time, it was almost dark at 4pm. I\u2019d taken to putting towels to the gap under the front door. My thoughts turned again, with fury, to our country\u2019s leadership vacuum. The prime minister\u2019s family lives here in Sydney; surely by now the man must be saying something? I checked his social media pages. Prime minister Morrison\u2019s Instagram account carried grinning images of him \u2013 baseball cap in place - atop a ladder, draping his family home in twinkly Christmas lights. No matter what\u2019s going on each year, says the PM of a burning nation, getting in the Christmas spirit has always been such an important part of our family life. Outside parliament in Canberra, a woman sets up the burnt remains of her family\u2019s destroyed house: a few iron sheets, a leaning section of charred wooden framework, twisted metal, black pots and pans. Her sign, painted on blackened corrugated iron sheet, reads: \u201cMorrison your climate crisis destroyed my home.\u201d Not very Christmassy, Melinda. Back here in the Marrickville morning, it\u2019s nine o\u2019clock and the birds are growing quiet again. The smell is back. It\u2019s astonishing how quickly it arrives; you sense it first in the back of the throat. I move through the house once more, closing all the doors and windows tight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
