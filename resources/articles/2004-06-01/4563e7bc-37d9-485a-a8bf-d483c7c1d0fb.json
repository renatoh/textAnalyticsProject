Snow Ridge joined Yeats at the head of the betting as a total of 16 horses, including two supplementary entries added to the field at a cost of \u00a375,000 each, were declared for the race. The money for the mount of Frankie Dettori, who has yet to win the Derby, arrived despite stamina concerns over the son of Indian Ridge, who never won a race above seven furlongs in distance, and the mare Snow Princess, who was successful over the 12-furlong Derby trip as a three-year-old. \"Both horses worked very well this morning and we are very happy with them,\" Simon Crisford, Godolphin's racing manager, said yesterday. \"We are not worried about the trip yet, what can we do? We will worry about it after the race. \"There are some purists who will tell you that Snow Ridge won't stay a mile and a half, and other purists who are adamant that he will. Only the race will tell us the answer.\" As expected, both Gatwick, who recently won two valuable handicaps in the space of five days, and Hazyview, who won a Listed race at Newmarket 10 days ago, were added to the Classic field yesterday. The two additional entries mean that the total prize fund for this year's Derby will be \u00a31.39m. Aidan O'Brien still has a total of three entries in the Classic, though the final strength of his team will not be decided until later this week. Moscow Ballet and Meath could both back up the challenge of Yeats, although Meath also holds an entry in the Prix du Jockey-Club (French Derby) at Chantilly the following day. North Light, the winner of the Dante Stakes at York, remains in the field, along with American Post, who was thought to be a doubtful runner after his fortunate success in the French 2,000 Guineas last time out. There will be no trip to Epsom, though, for either Cairdeas, who was heavily supported for the race before a recent defeat in Ireland, or Ecomium, the impressive winner of his only race to date, a maiden at Newmarket's Craven meeting. Grey Swallow, third to Bachelor Duke in the Irish 2,000 Guineas 10 days ago, is also missing from the declarations. The connections of John Gosden's Percussionist, the easy winner of the Lingfield Derby Trial on soft ground, will be hoping for rain at Epsom this week, but at present there is little sign of easy going on Saturday. \"It is on the fast side of good, approaching good to firm if anything,\" Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course, said yesterday. \"It doesn't sound as if we are going to get the rain we were forecast for this week. \"We may get a bit tonight, up to 5mm, but after that it looks as if it will remain fairly dry for the week. We will see what happens tonight and then take a view afterwards, but we haven't done any watering of any note since last Wednesday evening.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
