Have you any tips on how to reduce costs? I will be 19 and travelling alone. Will I be safe? Morgan Dye, Bristol However sensibly you plan your trip, you will find that Japan is significantly more expensive than other Asian countries. Fortunately, there are measures you can take to minimise spending. Food costs can be reduced by ordering set meals (setto). Look out for the cheap, filling soup on sale at many railway stations. Picnics are also a good option. Transport in Japan is clean and efficient, but can eat up a large amount of your budget. The Japan Rail Pass is worth the money if you're planning to travel widely in a short time. The pass can only be bought outside Japan at JAL and ANA offices or major travel agencies. For more information, visit the Japan Rail website. Another money-saver is the overnight bus. The crime rate in Japan is extremely low. However, the usual precautions should be followed. Keep in touch with family and friends through emails and/or phone calls and make sure that someone has a copy of your itinerary.

Mud glorious mud We have heard that to sample the mud treatment (peloide) in the French spa town of Dax, near Biarritz, you need a doctor's prescription. Would a prescription from our local GP satisfy the French love of paperwork? Kevin O'Rourke, by email Peloide is a natural thermal medicine used to relieve arthritis. It is derived from river limestone and hyper-thermal waters. The two components form a thermo-mineral mud, which is applied to joints for 12-16 minutes. The mud is heated to 38-44 C (100-111 F) and provides a sensation of heat and relaxation, as well as slight drowsiness. Peleotherapy is a recognised medical process, which, because of the extreme temperatures involved, requires a valid prescription. Your UK prescription will be sufficient. Contact the Dax Tourist Office (0033 5585 68686) . Scandinavian rail adventure Next spring I hope to visit friends in Scandinavia, taking in Antwerp and Hamburg en route. I will be 91 and unaccompanied, so surface travel is likely to suit best. Would you brief me on Inter-Rail travel and whether concessions are available. Frank Greaves Smith, Liverpool If you're travelling only to Antwerp and Hamburg before Scandinavia, you are best off getting point-to-point tickets until you enter Denmark. If you have a Senior Railcard for travel in the UK, Rail Europe can issue the Railplus Senior card for \u00a312, which entitles holders to a 25 per cent discount on cross-border rail travel between most European countries. In Scandinavia, the most flexible ticket is the Scanrail Senior pass, available for five days' travel within a month (\u00a3129) and 10 days' travel within two months (\u00a3175). An Inter-Rail pass covering Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland costs \u00a3185 for 14 days' unlimited travel. Contact Ultima Travel in South Wirral (0151 339 6171). Lake breaks in Hungary We are a family of four - our two children are aged eight and 11 - who would like to go to Hungary next summer holiday for a few days in Budapest and on Lake Balaton. Are there any tour companies offering this sort of package. Fortunately, cost is less important than the success of the holiday. Adam Moliver, Cheltenham Budapest and Lake Balaton make for a great two-centre holiday. Budapest has some of the finest architecture in Europe and cracking nightlife at good-value prices. Lake Balaton has many popular resorts along its southern shore. There are interesting towns to explore and it is a pleasant place to spend a few days.

We have visited places called Why and Nothing and loved them. Mrs J. E. Sunderland, Bradford The road to Nowhere ends in Oklahoma, in Caddo County, not far from Fort Cobb State Park. Though not officially a town, Nowhere has a water tower, petrol station and a selection of postcards.You could also visit two places called Nameless, one a few hours' drive from Savannah, Georgia, and the other near Carthage, Tennessee.
