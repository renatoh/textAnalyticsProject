She is well educated, bright and does not take any BS from anybody. She is a strong independent woman and a bright new star for her generation. I\u2019m sure she will make a good example for all the young men and women of our world. It\u2019s the young people that need to take over as they are the ones living here long after my generation has passed. Veikko, 65, Ilomantsi, Finland \u2018This is what politics is supposed to look like\u2019 I cannot recall when politics last made me cry tears of happiness. This did. I experienced my political awakening at age 16. The power that rose from the 2015 elections four years later didn\u2019t look like me. This, now, is what politics is supposed to look like. It is supposed to look into the future, think of the welfare of the people. Ella Kivisaari, student, Helsinki, Finland \u2018She\u2019s going to have a challenging time\u2019 She\u2019s going to have a challenging time finding a way to fund government spending and find a path to improving employment. She\u2019s fresh, popular and brings a major improvement in communication skills but also needs to break her ties with her predecessor Antti Rinne to be able to avoid an impression of being a marionette of his. Ilkka Kivi, 48, works in IT, Espoo, Finland \u2018Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin\u2019 Best choice for prime minister. Our political party has long needed \u2018fresh air\u2019. Sanna is very good at speaking in the media and doesn\u2019t hesitate to say her opinion. I\u2019m very pleased. The opposition parties will have to face a lady in parliament and I\u2019m loving it. Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin! Teemu Lintumaa, 35, Finland \u2018Her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party\u2019 She seems competent and will probably do alright, but I would say that her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party. The SDP is in a similar downfall such as so many former ruling parties across Europe, with their voter base leaking both to the far-right, far-left and to the greens. She is basically their only politician with star power, and they are now pulling her from the sleeve to save them from oblivion. Whether that will work is yet to be seen, but basically this appointment is about a 20th century party trying to be hip, cool and relevant in the 21st century. Mikko Damsk\u00e4gg, 28, student, Helsinki \u2018She stood out when I met her\u2019 I first met Sanna Marin around 10 years ago in an election panel. She stood out from the other panelists in a most positive way, with deep knowledge and formidable arguments. Over the years, she has proven herself as one of Finland\u2019s most apt politicians. I am so very happy and proud that she is our prime minister. Jari Kallio, 46, journalist and teacher, Tampere \u2018To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy\u2019 I\u2019m super excited and happy about our new PM! I think she\u2019s starting a whole new chapter in Finnish politics by lifting up some really important values like equality, climate change and solidarity between people. Finland has been led by more or less right-wing politicians for over 15 years and since the actual election things have started to change in Finland for the better. Sanna Marin as our new PM will surely keep our new government in order and work towards the goals set six months ago. To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy. Jarkko Veijanen, 39, project manager for a telephone company, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland \u2018I\u2019m disappointed Finns are not giving her a chance\u2019 It\u2019s great to see women and young women on the frontline in politics. We\u2019ve been hailed as a very equal country but even now the comments regarding Marin\u2019s appointment still leave me speechless. Her age, education, experience in both \u2018normal jobs\u2019 as well as politics are being questioned and I\u2019m quite sure this wouldn\u2019t have been the case if Antti Lindtman was appointed instead. I\u2019m so disappointed in Finns not even giving her a chance. Tiina, 43, TV prodicer, Helsinki"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
