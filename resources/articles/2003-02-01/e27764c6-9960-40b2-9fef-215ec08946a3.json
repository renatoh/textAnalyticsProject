The Kiwis, who made 241 for seven, looked to be heading for a comfortable victory when West Indies collapsed to 80 for six, but a seventh-wicket partnership of 98 between Ramnaresh Sarwan and Ridley Jacobs gave them hope. Daniel Vettori then bowled Sarwan for 75 and Jacobs was superbly caught by Jacob Oram for 50, effectively ending West Indian hopes of a second straight win in the tournament and they were eventually bowled out for 221 in the last over. New Zealand, beaten by Sri Lanka in their opening match, struggled for most of their innings, Nathan Astle top-scoring with 46 and Chris Cairns making 37. But Andre Adams (35 not out) and Brendon McCullum (36 not out) shared a sparkling unbroken eighth-wicket partnership of 53 to provide a late flurry of runs. Cairns conceded 21 runs in his solitary over, his first in one-day internationals for nearly a year, but he struck a vital blow in the field when his direct hit ran out Brian Lara for two. Adams picked up three wickets and Oram two before Sarwan and Jacobs led the West Indies recovery. Hooper's side surprisingly beat hosts South Africa in the tournament's opening match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
