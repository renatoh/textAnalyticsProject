The charity which looks after most castles, English Heritage, has appealed through a crowdfunding campaign for public help to tackle deep-rooted, invasive weeds such as ivy and valerian. \u201cIt is the great unnoticed issue,\u201d said Jeremy Ashbee, head properties curator at English Heritage. \u201cIf you go and visit almost any of our ruins, you will see vegetation is starting to appear and sometimes appears almost quite attractive because it softens the appearance of the bare stonework. \u201cBut actually, it can be really insidious. When the green stuff starts to turn to the brown stuff, the hard woody shrubs, it can be a bit of a nightmare. It can be really dangerous.\u201d Vegetation can loosen masonry in castle walls. Once weeds are removed, the walls need repairs which might involve rebedding or replacing the loose stones. Ashbee stressed that English Heritage was not warning of a ticking time bomb. \u201cWe haven\u2019t let things get to that stage, but the important thing is we don\u2019t want to.\u201d Nor is it just weeds that are an ongoing conservation problem for the 66 castles it looks after: there is also penetrating damp and damage from severe weather. English Heritage became a charity three years ago, with the aim of becoming self-sufficient rather than depend on government money. It launched its first crowdfunding campaign last year, to help its project to conserve the Iron Bridge in Shropshire. \u201cWe were deeply moved and overwhelmed by the depth of support we got,\u201d said Ashbee. English Heritage learned, he added, that if people know where the cash is going, they are more receptive to fundraising. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson we learned from the Iron Bridge. It wasn\u2019t just: \u2018Please give us money and we will spend it.\u2019\u201d The charity said more people were visiting castles than ever before. Since May, a record 1.2 million visitors have had a day out at one of its castles, a 10% rise on last year. It said a donation of \u00a325 could pay for 1 sq metre of invasive vegetation to be removed; \u00a350 could pay for three hours of the stonemasonry needed to conserve walls; and \u00a375 could pay for half a sq metre of stonework to be repointed with bespoke lime mortars. Rewards being offered range from a car sticker and bookmark for a donation of \u00a34; two places on the \u201cstory of the sieges\u201d tour of Carlisle Castle for \u00a3100; and the opportunity to fire a first world war anti-aircraft gun off the walls of Dover Castle for \u00a32,500. English Heritage will spend about \u00a31.9m this year on wall repairs, and wants to raise an extra \u00a350,000 via its castles crowdfunding appeal, part of its #LoveCastles summer season. Ashbee said weeds were far from being a new problem, but it may be that the public were less aware of them. Exposed castles and ones on a high hill, such as Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, are particularly susceptible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
