Having shovelled hundreds of billions of dollars at failing financial companies, where workers earning absurd multiples of the average American income endangered the whole of the world economy with their careless behaviour, how could Democratic leaders say no to the blue-collar workers manning the assembly lines at Ford and General Motors? In the wake of a magnificent electoral victory built on promises to help Main Street, how can the president-elect tell the country that the government's bail-outs are reserved for Wall Street? One easy answer is that such rescues aren't to be made lightly, and automakers (unfortunately for them) aren't threatening to destroy the global financial system. Another is that once the government is in the business of bailing out automakers, it becomes very hard to say no to airlines, retailers, technology companies and every other struggling firm out there, which is every firm out there. But the best answer of all is that a bail-out involving tens of billions of taxpayer dollars ought to hold out the promise of helping the people it's supposed to help. Saving Ford, General Motors and Chrysler provides no such hope. In all probability, a bail-out will hurt the very region it's meant to help. One reason for this is that a rescue is unlikely to work. The Big Three face an enormous array of challenges. Recent economic conditions have battered all automakers, but in both good and bad times Detroit has more or less constantly ceded market share to rival firms (many of which employ thousands of Americans and will operate through the recession with no government assistance). Its plants and equipment are old. Its management is unproductive and rigid. Its products are of low quality. Absent major restructuring, it is fantasy to expect a change. Detroit has found itself in these straits in the past. Nearly 30 years ago, as the American automakers flailed amid high oil prices and foreign competition, Chrysler went to the government hat in hand, seeking help to avoid bankruptcy. It got it, and in return promised to build better and more fuel-efficient cars. Chrysler survived and even thrived at times on sales of minivans and SUVs, but the firm never solved its fundamental problems. The bail-out kept a company alive, yes. But it failed to save the Rust Belt or produce the necessary top-to-bottom restructuring. We have little reason to expect a different outcome this time around. More important still is the opportunity cost of saving the automakers. It is suggested that millions of jobs might be lost if the firms folded. That may well be true, but those workers wouldn't remain unemployed forever. At present, the Big Three suck up labour and human, physical and financial capital that might instead be employed at more productive firms in healthier industries. Allowing the automakers to fail creates an opportunity for a much-needed reallocation of resources. From their ashes, anything, including an automaker free of the institutional burdens of the Big Three, might emerge. Standing in the way of this process will damage the long-term outlook of the entire region. Political energy in the Rust Belt is also geared toward maintaining the status quo at the expense of other priorities. It's frequently suggested that the region's manufacturing expertise might be redeployed into green industries, producing valuable new technologies for global consumption. But regional legislators politically committed to automobile production often push a less aggressive approach to climate change legislation \u2013 reducing the profit potential of green products. Heavy dependence on the old slows progress toward the new. And there is the direct opportunity cost of the money involved \u2013 $50bn spent propping up the Big Three is $50bn that can't be spent on direct investments in the people and cities of the Rust Belt. That kind of money could fund early retirement for older workers and unemployment benefits and retraining for younger workers, with enough left over for infrastructure improvements, research incentives and educational grants for the region as a whole. Ford, General Motors and Chrysler are American institutions. They have helped define the character, the shape and the economy of the nation for a century. They're also just companies \u2013 corporate entities designed to provide goods and services at a profit. For too long, these firms have failed at that goal, and they've dragged down an entire region with them. We can spend that $50bn simply perpetuating, for a while longer, the names and structures of these companies. Or we can spend that $50bn helping the people and the cities of the Midwest. I don't think we can do both."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
