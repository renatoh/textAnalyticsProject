At the height of its popularity on Wednesday afternoon, the petition, which calls for Trump to be stopped from entering Britain on the grounds of hate speech, was racking up more than 30,000 signatures an hour, according to parliament\u2019s petitions website. Parliament considers all petitions that receive more than 100,000 signatures for a debate. The petition to ban Trump, which became open for signatures at 4.39pm Tuesday, had been signed by 360,0090 people by midnight on Wednesday. It says: \u201cThe signatories believe Donald J Trump should be banned from UK entry. The UK has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech. The same principles should apply to everyone who wishes to enter the UK. \u201cIf the United Kingdom is to continue applying the \u2018unacceptable behaviour\u2019 criteria to those who wish to enter its borders, it must be fairly applied to the rich as well as poor, and the weak as well as powerful.\u201d The petition comes after Trump was widely criticised for saying on Monday that Muslims should be banned from entering the US. He said in a speech following a mass shooting committed by a Muslim couple in San Bernardino, California, last weekend: \u201cWe need a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States while we figure out what the hell is going on. We are out of control.\u201d On Tuesday, there was widespread condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments, including from fellow Republican presidential contenders. And later comments from the presidential hopeful in a radio interview that there were districts of London and Paris so \u201cradicalised\u201d that they were off limits to police led to further angry rebuttals from UK politicians and the police. The London Metropolitan police said Trump \u201ccould not be more wrong\u201d, while the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cLondon has a proud history of tolerance and diversity and to suggest there are areas where police officers cannot go because of radicalisation is simply ridiculous.\u201d The UK chancellor, George Osborne, said on Wednesday it was best to combat Donald Trump through robust democratic debate and not to try to ban him from the UK on the grounds that his remarks incited racial hatred. Speaking at prime minister\u2019s questions, Osborne said Trump\u2019s views \u201cflew in the face of the founding principles of the American founding fathers\u201d, adding that those principles had been an inspiration all round the world. He continued: \u201cThe best way to defeat nonsense like this is to engage in robust and democratic debate, and to make it clear his views are not welcome.\u201d Osborne\u2019s aides said the previous occasions when foreigners had been banned from the UK reflected moments when individuals had been repeatedly convicted of race hate crimes, and this did not apply to Trump. A Downing Street spokesman said there were no known plans for Trump to visit the UK, so suggestions of a ban from Britain were hypothetical. He added the remarks should be seen in the context of an internal Republican election campaign. Jon Trickett, the shadow communities secretary, praised Osborne\u2019s remarks as clear and straightforward. He said it was \u201centirely inappropriate to suggest every follower of one of the world\u2019s great religions has to be suspected of terrorism\u201d. He added it was \u201cwrong, divisive, dangerous and may speed up the radicalisation of individuals\u201d. Although he said it was interesting that so many people had called for a ban, Trickett said he preferred staging a debate, rather than imposing travel bans. The home secretary can decide to exclude a person from the UK if it is believed that an \u201cindividual\u2019s presence in the UK would not be conducive to the public good\u201d, according to government guidance. In effect, that usually means people seen to be preaching hate or inciting extremism. However, individuals can also be blocked on the grounds of their criminal records. People previously banned from Britain include Mike Tyson, over his rape conviction, Dieudonn\u00e9 M\u2019bala M\u2019bala, the controversial French comedian accused of antisemitism, and Stephen Donald Black, founder of the white-supremacist website Stormfront. The Home Office said it did not comment in individual cases. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has moved to sever all Scottish government business links with Donald Trump. The first minister withdrew Trump\u2019s membership of the GlobalScot business network, run by Scottish Enterprise, with immediate effect. A Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cMr Trump\u2019s recent remarks have shown that he is no longer fit to be a business ambassador for Scotland and the first minister has decided his membership of the respected GlobalScot business network should be withdrawn with immediate effect.\u201d Sturgeon described Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cobnoxious and offensive\u201d, and \u201crightly \u2026 condemned by people across the political spectrum\u201d. Trump was invited to join the GlobalScot network, which describes itself as a \u201cdiverse network of business leaders, entrepreneurs and executives with a connection to Scotland\u201d, in 2006. Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people have so far signed a petition calling for Aberdeen\u2019s Robert Gordon University (RGU) to revoke the honorary degree awarded to Trump in 2010 in recognition of his \u201cbusiness acumen and entrepreneurial vision\u201d. The decision was controversial at the time, with a former RGU principal handing back his own honorary doctorate in protest. A RGU spokeswoman said the current principal, Ferdinand von Prondzynski, was \u201cconsidering the position\u201d, adding: \u201cProfessor von Prondzynski is totally committed to equality of opportunity and to respect for different cultures, values which are an important part of RGU\u2019s ethos.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
