While it was too soon to talk of recession, said the CBI's director general, Digby Jones, it would be a \"worrying Easter\" for many in business. The foot and mouth disease crisis alone would cut 0.3 of a percentage point off growth Meanwhile, the European Central Bank ignored calls for it to insulate the eurozone from the threat of recession by lowering borrowing costs, deciding instead yesterday to keep rates on hold at 4.75%. Despite the darkening outlook, official figures released yesterday showed City firms awarded staff bumper bonuses in February. The impact of financial sector awards, estimated at about \u00a3300m over the month, was enough to send wage inflation to a 10-month high, dashing hopes of further swift cuts to borrowing costs. Average earnings increases are rising at an annual 5%, a jump of half a percentage point on the previous month, taking them well above the 4.5% level which the Bank of England's monetary policy committee considers consistent with the inflation target. \" A large part of the increase is bonus-related, so this may prove to be a one-off jump,\" said John Butler at HSBC Markets. \"Nevertheless, at the minimum this will almost certainly rule out the possibility of a further rate cut at the next MPC meeting.\" The CBI's forecast suggested a further cut might be needed to lift the economy. \"This preliminary forecast indicates a sharp slowdown in growth,\" Mr Jones said. \"But this is no time for people to panic, because the UK economy is fundamentally strong.\" Reinforcing this view, yesterday's labour market data from the office for national statistics showed that unemployment fell again in March. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by 5500, to 995,200, the lowest level since December 1976. Although the government celebrated unemployment falling through the 1m mark last month when the February figures were published, the ONS has revised upward that figure and now says the milestone was reached in March. Unemployment also fell on the government's preferred measure, based on the standard international definition which counts everybody looking for work, not just those on benefits. On this measure, joblessness declined by 42,000 in the three months to February, taking the level to 1.535m. The CBI and most other forecasters expect unemployment to start rising this year as the slowdown bites. A separate forecast from Business Strate gies warned that foot and mouth could cost the tourism industry \u00a32bn this year. The euro took another pounding on the foreign exchanges as investors expressed their irritation about the ECB's decision to keep rates on hold. The single currency lost almost a cent against the dollar as the ECB president, Wim Duisenberg, indicated that the bank remained more concerned about the risks of infla tion than the outlook for economic growth. \"Economic growth in the euro area is expected to remain solid. Available forecasts suggest that actual growth will be in line with trend potential growth,\" Mr Duisenberg said. While the ECB is sanguine that the global slowdown will have only a limited impact, analysts were largely unimpressed by the decision to leave rates on hold. \"We really have to ask whether the ECB is taking too big a gamble in terms of euro-zone growth and the global economy,\" said Adolph Rosenstock at Nomura International in Frankfurt. \"We all hope they are right in their assessment but it carries a very high risk.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
