This is industry jargon for not having one team make all the decisions but carving up the fund and dishing out slices to other managers, chosen for their expertise in specific sectors. For investment trusts, such as Witan, I prefer a single management team to have total control on both asset allocation and stock selection. A switch to multi-manager may also mean a change in risk profile and shareholders need to satisfy themselves that the new approach meets their needs. If not, there are plenty of successful alternatives where stock selection is not sub-contracted."}, "isHosted": false}}}
