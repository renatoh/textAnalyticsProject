It was the only blemish on a great tournament for the Ghana-born defender, a great leader and reader of the game. He was fearless, inspirational and more than capable of starting a move from the back. Zinedine Zidane may have might have brought the magic, but Desailly provided a foundation. John Duerden 59 Lu\u00eds Figo (Portugal) World Cups 2002, 2006 Appearances 10 Goals 0 A 24-carat member of Portugal\u2019s Golden Generation who could score, dribble, cross, cut inside, shoot, pass and inspire team-mates, Figo\u2019s first World Cup, in 2002, ended in disaster when his side were eliminated from the group stages. Cajoled out of international retirement four years later, Figo led his country to the semi-final at Germany 2006. Barry Glendenning 58 Sandor Kocsis (Hungary) World Cups 1954 Appearances 5 Goals 11 \u201cGolden Head\u201d, as he was nicknamed, was aA inside-forward, the first man to score two hat-tricks at the World Cup, and the man who became the leader of Hungary\u2019s attack when Ferenc Puskas was injured. He scored two against Brazil in the quarter-final, headed the second and third in goals in Hungary\u2019s epic 4-2 win over Uruguay. He\u2019d got four against West Germany in the group stage, but he failed to score against the same opposition as Hungary lost the final 3-2. Jonathan Wilson 57 Vav\u00e1 (Brazil) World Cups 1958, 1962 Appearances 10 Goals 9 Vav\u00e1\u2019s Brazil career was short (20 caps) but the centre-forward was instrumental in their first two World Cup titles. A no-nonsense poacher, Vav\u00e1 was not technically exuberant like some of his legendary team-mates, but his robustness and efficiency \u2013 hence the nickname The Tank \u2013 more than made up for it: only him, Zinedine Zidane, Paul Breitner and a certain Pel\u00e9 managed to score in two World Cup finals. Fernando Duarte 56 Hristo Stoichkov (Bulgaria) World Cups 1994, 1998 Appearances 10 Goals 6 The winner of the Golden Boot at USA 94 along with Russia\u2019s Oleg Salenko, Hristo Stoichkov is footballing royalty in his own country. Undoubtedly the finest ever Bulgarian footballer, not to mention one of the most potent forwards in the history of the game, Stoichkov was a phenomenally gifted striker who used to torment defences with his pace, intelligence and trickery. He scored six goals to help Bulgaria reach the semi-final, including a brilliant free-kick in their quarter-final win over Germany. Jacob Steinberg 55 Sepp Maier West Germany World Cups 1970, 1974, 1978 Appearances 18 Goals conceded 18 Maier\u2019s fantastic reflexes in the box \u2013 they called him \u201cthe cat of Anzing\u201d, after his hometown \u2013 were only matched by his freakish durability. The gaunt Bayern Munich goalkeeper missed a grand total of three league games in a spell of 14 years at the Bundesliga club. A variety of saves against Johan Cruyff\u2019s Oranje team helped West Germany to win the World Cup in 1974, and he probably would have worn his country\u2019s No1 shirt well into his 40s if it had not been for a car accident in 1979. Raphael Honigstein 54 Geoff Hurst (England) World Cups 1966, 1970 Appearances 6 Goals 5 The only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final, a feat achieved against West Germany in 1966. Hurst had made his England debut against the same opposition only five months before the tournament and took advantage of an injury to Jimmy Greaves to secure his place by registering the winner against Argentina in the quarter-finals. Represented his country again in 1970, ended with 24 goals from 49 games, and is the only English first-class cricketer to have a World Cup winners\u2019 medal. Dominic Fifield 53 Andreas Brehme (Germany) World Cups 1986, 1990, 1994 Appearances 16 Goals 4 A big-game player who scored three of his four World Cup goals in semi-finals and finals, the ultra-dependable left-back and free-kick specialist famously scored the decisive late penalty in the 1990 final with his right foot, even though he is a natural left-footer. An intelligent footballer who revolutionised full-back play, Brehme played in two finals, both against Argentina. \u201cHe was technically perfect, with his right foot as well as his left,\u201d said his team-mate Thomas Doll. \u201cHe could hit a fly on the bar with the ball.\u201d BG 52 Tost\u00e3o (Brazil) World Cups 1966, 1970 Appearances 7 Goals 3 An attacking midfielder who was Brazil\u2019s top scorer in the 1970 World Cup qualifiers under manager Jo\u00e3o Sadalnha, Tost\u00e3o (\u201cLittle Coin\u201d) found himself benched by Mario Zagallo, who replaced Saldanha weeks before the tournament. That was until Zagallo deployed Tost\u00e3o as a false No9 who excelled in opening up spaces and serving his team-mates. He went on to shine in Brazil\u2019s superlative third World Cup win, providing two assists in the 3-1 semi-final victory against the Uruguayans, for example. A recurring eye injury forced his retirement in 1973, at 26. FD 51 Lionel Messi (Argentina) World Cups 2006, 2010 Appearances 8 Goals 1 For all his brilliance at club level with Barcelona, Lionel Messi is yet to truly shine on the international stage with Argentina and some people believe he must take a World Cup by storm before he can be spoken of in the same terms as Diego Maradona. Messi was used sparingly by Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman in 2006, although did score in a group game against Serbia, and was below his best four years ago as a malfunctioning Argentina were crushed by Germany in the last eight. Jacob Steinberg 50 Uwe Seeler (West Germany) World Cups 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970 Appearances 21 Goals 9 \u201cUns Uwe\u201d (our Uwe), as he was known, never managed to win a trophy with Germany, but nevertheless finished his career as a bona-fide postwar star after finding the net in four different World Cups. Off the pitch, Seeler was unassuming and reliably down to earth - he turned down offers to play in Italy for more money and never played for a different club than Hamburg - but in action, the striker would take flight: his speciality was acrobatic headers, and his most famous World Cup goal (the 2-2 equaliser in the quarter-final against England in Mexico) was an almost impossible aerial feat. Raphael Honigstein 49 N\u00edlton Santos (Brazil) World Cups 1950, 1954, 1958, 1962 Appearances 15 Goals 1 N\u00edlton Santos was the archetypal Brazilian left-back. At a time when back-four players really were expected to play at the back, he began a tradition of attacking prowess that remains one of the hallmarks of Brazilian football. His only World Cup goal, against Austria in 1958, is an example of this original behaviour: legend has it that his darting 60-yard run had the desperate disapproving screams of the manager Vicente Feola as a soundtrack. Fernando Duarte 48 Djalma Santos (Brazil) World Cups 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966 Appearances 12 Goals 1 After sinking with Brazil in their infamous 1954 campaign, during which he became involved in a horrific brawl with the Hungarians following an ill-tempered quarter-final, Santos emerged as the stuff of legend after making the 1958 team of the tournament despite playing only the final game, against the Swedes . He would also be in the All-Star XI in 1954 and 1962. With 111 caps and 11 goals, the right-back was named by Fifa as the all-time best in his position. Santos was never sent off in a career spanning more than 1,000 games. Fernando Duarte 47 Gary Lineker (England) World Cups 1986, 1990 Appearances 12 Goals 10 Prolific at five clubs and for his country, Lineker scored a hat-trick against Poland in the critical group match at Mexico 86, and two more in the knockout round against Paraguay as well as the consolation as Maradona\u2019s \u201cHand of God\u201d jettisoned England from the tournament in the quarter-finals. There were four more rewards at Italia 90, making Lineker only the eighth player to score 10 or more at the World Cup. He ended his England career with 48 goals in 80 caps. Dominic Fifield 46 Franco Baresi (Italy) World Cups 1982, 1990, 1994 Appearances 10 Goals 0 A remarkably consistent record: wWinner in 1982, bronze medallist in 1990 and runner-up in 1994, Baresi\u2019s presence at the 1994 final represented the culmination of a minor medical miracle. After tearing the meniscus in his right knee during the group phase, the Italy captain underwent surgery, and somehow made it back in time to but returned to faceBrazil at the Rose Bowl 24 days later. . Incredibly, he would play the full 120 minutes, helping his team to a clean sheet \u2013 only to then miss Italy\u2019s first penalty on the way to an agonising shootout defeat. Paolo Bandini 45 Daniel Passarella (Argentina) World Cups 1978, 1982, 1986 Appearances 12 Goals 3 El Gran Capit\u00e1n lifted the World Cup trophy in 1978 amid the ticker tape of Buenos Aires to end a tournament that had demonstrated the coolness and composure of an intelligent centre-back. He had the ball skills of a player suited to further up the pitch \u2013 and a goalscoring record to match too, finding the net 22 times in 70 internationals. He didn\u2019t play in 1986, but is the only Argentinian to be a member of both World Cup-winning squads. John Duerden 44 Gianluigi Buffon (Italy) World Cups 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 Appearances 12 Goals conceded 8 Italy\u2019s most capped player, Buffon will take part in his fifth World Cup this summer. He must hope it goes better than the last one, when a back injury ended his tournament after just 45 minutes, and the Azzurri exited without a win. Thankfully he has better memories to fall back on, most notably the 2006 triumph. Buffon kept five clean sheets in seven matches that year, and won the Lev Yashin award as the best goalkeeper at the tournament. Paolo Bandini 43 Zbigniew Boniek (Poland) World Cups 1978, 1982, 1986 Appearances 16 Goals 6 Good enough to inspire Poland to victory in the Spain 1982 bronze medal match, \u201cZibi\u201d was turned down by several English clubs on the spurious grounds that he was too selfish. Fast and intelligent with speed in abundance, his tireless running suggested otherwise and scored one of the best hat-tricks in World Cup history against Belgium, only to pick up a suspension that ruled him out of the semi-final loss to Italy. BG 42 Oliver Kahn (Germany) World Cups 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006 Appearances 8 Goals conceded 4 A member of four different German squads but first-choice goalkeeper in just one: Japan and South Korea 2002. Kahn conceded just three goals, keeping five clean sheets and becoming the only goalkeeper to be named the tournament\u2019s best player, although a rare rick in the final gifted a goal to winners Brazil. Demoted to No2 in 2006, Kahn melted hearts worldwide when he embraced his bitter rival and usurper Jens Lehmann before Germany\u2019s penalty shootout win over Argentina in the quarter-finals. BG 41 Gordon Banks (England) World Cups 1966, 1970 Appearances 9 Goals conceded 4 England\u2019s excellent goalkeeper as the 1966 hosts conceded only one goal, to a Eus\u00e9bio penalty, en route to the final against West Germany. Banks conceded his first goals from open play in the final at Wembley but went on to collect a winners\u2019 medal. In 1970 his right-handed save to deny Pel\u00e9, heading down a Jairzinho cross, is written into the tournament\u2019s folklore even if his team were still beaten 1-0. He missed the quarter-final loss through food poisoning \u2013 his replacement Peter Bonetti is blamed by many for the defeat to West Germany \u2013 and would lose the sight in his right eye in a car accident two years later having amassed 73 caps and conceded 57 goals. DF 40 Giuseppe Meazza (Italy) World Cups 1934, 1938 Appearances 9 Goals 3 As with so many of football\u2019s early international stars, it is hard to know where the myth ends with Meazza and the reality begins. It has been reported many times that the player\u2019s shorts fell down as he prepared to take a penalty against Brazil in 1938, but footage of the goal shows no evidence of this. What we do know is that he was a key figure for Italy as they won back-to-back tournaments in 1934 and 1938. Paolo Bandini 39 Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (West Germany) World Cups 1978, 1982, 1986 Appearances 19 Goals 9 The first captain to lose two World Cup finals, but Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was also one of the most talented strikers to represent West Germany. One of the few players to impress during a disappointing campaign in 1978, he also helped them reach the final in 1982, scoring in an incredible semi-final win on penalties over France, but was unable to inspire against Italy and he was on the losing side again in 1986 despite his best efforts against Argentina. JS 38 Lilian Thuram (France) World Cups 1998, 2002, 2006 Appearances 16 Goals 2 France were staring down the barrel of a gun when Davor Suker gave Croatia the lead in the 46th minute of their semi-final in 1998. Goals had been hard to come by for the hosts in their previous two matches, but an unlikely saviour was about to reveal himself: Lilian Thuram, who equalised a minute later, before scoring again after 69 minutes to send France on the way to their first ever World Cup. They were the only goals Thuram, who was a marvellous defender, ever scored in a glittering international career. Jacob Steinberg 37 Paul Breitner (West Germany) World Cups 1974, 1982 Appearances 14 Goals 4 Breitner\u2019s wildly contrasting fortunes at his two World Cups neatly encapsulated his team\u2019s arc, from celebrated \u201crebel\u201d footballers to disgruntled cynics. In 1974, he scored the equalising penalty in the final on the way to victory against the Dutch as a young, creative right-footer who was playing wide out left, in more than one sense: the Bavarian enjoyed provoking his public by quoting Mao. That rebellious stance was soon forgotten when he moved from Bayern to General Franco\u2019s Real Madrid after the Munich triumph, however. Breitner returned to captain Germany as a hard-nosed central midfielder at the inglorious 1982 World Cup in Spain, where he scored again in a final. But it was only a consolation goal (Italy won 3-1) and his team went home in disgrace, with Breitner retiring from football altogether a year later. Raphael Honigstein Roger Milla Cameroon World Cups 1982, 1990, 1994 Appearances 10 Goals 5 Roger Milla was in semi-retirement playing in Reunion when the call came for him to rescue a Cameroon squad that had lurched from crisis to crisis in the build-up to the 1990 World Cup. He had played in 1982 but it was then, at 38, that he became a household name. Not fit enough to start games, Milla became the ultimate in super-subs. The striker came on with nine minutes to go in Cameroon\u2019s shock win over Argentina in the tournament\u2019s opening match, showing enough intelligence that he was risked after 58 minutes of the second match, against Romania; 18 minutes later he scored, outmuscling Ioan Andone and belting the ball past Silviu Lung. He celebrated by racing to the corner flag, raising his right hand and gyrating his hips. \u201cIt was an instantaneous manifestation of my joy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not at all planned. I just felt like dancing each time I scored. It was the first time ever that I felt like doing that dance.\u201d He was doing it again 10 minutes later, pouncing after a cross had looped over Andr\u00e9 Kana-Biyik, accelerating by Andone and crashing his shot in at the near post. The last-16 game against Colombia was 0-0 after 90 minutes but in extra-time Milla took charge again. First he latched on to Fran\u00e7ois Omam-Biyik\u2019s pass, sashayed through two challenges and finished ebulliently, then he picked the pocket of Ren\u00e9 Higuita as he dallied yards outside his box and knocked the ball into an empty net. He nearly turned the quarter-final against England as well, being fouled for the penalty with which Cameroon equalised and then setting up Emmanuel Ekeke for the goal that put Cameroon ahead. Two Gary Lineker penalties eventually eliminated Cameroon but Milla was back four years later to become the World Cup\u2019s oldest goalscorer, scoring in Cameroon\u2019s 6-1 defeat to Russia. JW 35 Roberto Carlos (Brazil) World Cups 1998, 2002, 2006 Appearances 17 Goals 1 A rampaging, thunder-thighed left wing-back who packed a howitzer of a shot but wasn\u2019t quite as good at taking free-kicks as he thought he was, Carlos played an astonishing 17 matches at three World Cups, reaching two finals and winning one. Named in Fifa\u2019s teams of the tournament for 1998 and 2002, Carlos had a less happy time in 2006 and retired from internationals after being blamed for a France winning goal. BG 34 Carlos Alberto (Brazil) World Cups 1970 Appearances 6 Goals 1 One World Cup and one goal: enough for Carlos Alberto to become unforgettable. Playing alongside Pel\u00e9, Jairzinho and company certainly helped, but the captain of that fabled 1970 side made sure to steal the limelight with a missile of a right-footer that is widely considered the best team goal ever scored \u2013 the final one in Brazil\u2019s 4-1 demolition of Italy in the Mexico final. Fernando Duarte 33 Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) World Cups 2006, 2010 Appearances 10 Goals 2 Ronaldo almost single-handedly dragged Portugal through their qualifying play-off against Sweden but remains, in England at least, best known in World Cup folklore for a 2006 incident in which he \u2018helped\u2019 in the dismissal of his then club-mate Wayne Rooney in the quarter-final. Man of the match in all three of Portugal\u2019s group games in 2010. BG 32 Roberto Rivelino (Brazil) World Cups 1970, 1974, 1978 Appearances 15 Goals 6 Only Diego Maradona had a more famous left foot than the moustachioed Brazilian midfielder. But Maradona did not have the same power or venom in his shots \u2013 venom that he Rivelino put to good use in scoring three crucial goals for the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o in 1970, including one in a tricky semi-final with Uruguay, the first World Cup encounter between the South American neighbours since Brazil\u2019s notorious home capitulation 20 years before. Rivelino\u2019s \u201crubber-band\u201d dribble, honed in his futsal playing days, was pretty special too. Fernando Duarte 31 Mario Kempes (Argentina) World Cups 1974, 1978, 1982 Appearances 18 Goals 6 With his long, streaky black hair and explosive style, Mario Kempes captured the imagination and refused to give it back when he led Argentina to glory at the 1978 World Cup with some thrilling performances. Strong, skilful, fast and blessed with a fearsome shot, he impressed during Argentina\u2019s run to the final, where he seized the moment by scoring twice as Holland were beaten 3-1 in extra-time. \u201cI love him,\u201d Diego Maradona says. What more needs to be said? Jacob Steinberg 30 Lev Yashin (USSR) World Cups 1958, 1962, 1966 Appearances 13 Goals conceded 18 A player who reinvented the art of goalkeeping by not simply being content to save shots but by barking out orders to his defenders, claiming crosses and coming off his line to close down angles for attackers, Lev Yashin has an almost mythical status among goalkeepers, the high priest of keeping goal. He first came to prominence at the 1958 World Cup, where he earned the nickname the Black Spider because he was dressed in black from head to toe, and in 1966 he helped the Soviet Union reach the semi-finals, where they were beaten by West Germany. In 1963, he became the first goalkeeper to win the Ballon d\u2019Or, an achievement that has never been repeated. JS 29 Johan Neeskens (Holland) World Cups 1974, 1978 Appearances 12 Goals 5 Twice a runner-up with the great Holland teams of the 1970s, Neeskens famously opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 1974 final against West Germany with just two minutes on the clock. It was his fifth goal of the tournament, best among them a splendid chipped effort in the second round against Brazil. A battle-hardened, skilful attacking midfielder, his second attempt to win that elusive World Cup winners\u2019 medal was derailed by a hostile Argentina in a violent encounter that Holland lost 3-1. Barry Glendenning 28 M\u00e1rio Zagallo (Brazil) World Cups 1958, 1962 Appearances 12 Goals 2 A tactically sound winger or midfielder whose vision helped create the 4-3-3 system, Zagallo is a four-time World Cup winner (two as a player, one as the manager of the 1970 team and as technical director in 1994). He also scored in the 1958 World Cup final. But the Old Wolf still divides opinions in his own country, a situation that his fiery temper didn\u2019t really help. Fernando Duarte 27 Rivaldo (Brazil) World Cups 1998, 2002 Appearances 14 Goals 8 It would be a shame if Rivaldo is remembered most for a preposterously brazen piece of cheating which caused Turkey\u2019s Hakan Unsal to be sent off in Brazil\u2019s opening game of the 2002 World Cup. Part of the attacking trident also featuring Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, Rivaldo was sensational in Japan and South Korea, his five goals helping Brazil claim the trophy for a record fifth time. It is impossible to grow tired of watching his stunning volley to break the deadlock against Belgium in the second round. JS 26 Fabio Cannavaro (Italy) World Cups 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 Appearances 18 Goals 0 Zinedine Zidane was named as player of the tournament at the 2006 World Cup, but Cannavaro had the last laugh \u2013 beating Zizou\u2019s France in the final and going on to win both the Ballon d\u2019Or and Fifa\u2019s World Player of the Year award. He was the first defender ever to claim the latter accolade, and deservedly so. Cannavaro\u2019s impeccable timing and reading of the game had been a key factor as Italy conceded just twice in seven World Cup games. Paolo Bandini 25 Cafu (Brazil) World Cups 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006 Appearances 20 Goals 0 More right winger than right-back, Cafu was regarded as one of the finest defenders in the world and opposition wingers knew that they were more likely to spend their time defending than attacking when up against him. Although he had a minimal role when Brazil won in 1994, he had made himself a permanent fixture by 1998, a tournament which ended with that infamous 3-0 defeat in the final to the hosts, France. Brazil slumped for a while but then they roared back to win the World Cup in 2002 under Luiz Felipe Scolari, whose tactical tweaks gave his buccaneering full-backs, Cafu and Roberto Carlos, the freedom to maraud. JS 24 Roberto Baggio (Italy) World Cups 1990, 1994, 1998 Appearances 16 Goals 9 It is one of football\u2019s great injustices that a missed penalty shall always be remembered as the iconic moment of Baggio\u2019s career. It was he who had dragged Italy to the final in 1994, scoring five goals and rescuing them from a late deficit against Nigeria in the last 16. The Divine Ponytail would later become the only Italian ever to score in three World Cups, but will never be allowed to forget that lone spot-kick scooped towards the heavens. PB 23 Ronaldinho (Brazil) World Cups 2002, 2006 Appearances 10 Goals 2 An absurdly talented left-sided forward who comprised one prong of the attacking trident including Ronaldo and Rivaldo in Brazil\u2019s 2002 win in Japan and South Korea, famously making England goalkeeper David Seaman look a chump along the way. Woefully out of sorts as Brazil flattered to deceive four years later, the 34-year-old appears to have missed out on his chance at redemption on his native soil having been overlooked for Brazil\u2019s squad this time round. Barry Glendenning 22 Zico (Brazil) World Cups 1978, 1982, 1986 Appearances 14 Goals 5 Zico never won a World Cup but was part of one the most watchable sides ever to play at a World Cup, in 1982. He became one of the most heralded players of the game, admired around the world, and you do not get to be known as the \u201cWhite Pel\u00e9\u201d for nothing. An all-round player whose free-kicks were unrivalled (just google Brazil v Scotland 1982), Zico played only two seasons in Europe \u2013 representing Udinese \u2013 but left an impression big enough to have a supporters\u2019 group named after him. FD 21 Ferenc Puskas (Hungary) World Cups 1954, 1962 Appearances 6 Goals 4 Short, heavy set, resolutely one-footed and useless in the air, the Galloping Major was an unlikely football star but his speed, astonishing dribbling skills and thunderbolt left foot made him the standout player in the \u201cMagical Magyars\u201d, who lost just one of the 51 matches they played between 1950 and 1956. Unfortunately for the scorer of 84 goals in 85 international matches, that defeat came in the 1954 final, when he played in vain through an ankle injury as his wonderful side lost 3-2 to Germany.
