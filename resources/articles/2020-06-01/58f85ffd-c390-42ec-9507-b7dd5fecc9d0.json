Sevilla triumph on silent return", "bodyText": "Sevilla are breaking the rules already but who can blame them? The leaflet of instructions handed to every club before La Liga\u2019s return to action insisted \u201cplayers should avoid or minimise physical contact with celebrations\u201d, yet when the time finally came they couldn\u2019t help themselves, a pile of players building in the corner before an empty stand where euphoria would normally erupt. There was still almost half an hour left in the Seville derby, Spain\u2019s first game back, but a second goal had secured victory over Real Betis, the team they most like to beat at the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n. They had waited a long time for this, and the goal that effectively ended this game was wonderful. Lucas Ocampos had opened the scoring from a debatable penalty soon after half-time and now it was Fernando, who couldn\u2019t hear the drums but could hear his teammates shouting right in his ear, voices echoing round. Four first-time touches from a short corner had concluded with Ocampos\u2019s clever backheel lifted into the path of Fernando, who finished with a glancing header. Ninety-three days after it shut down, Spanish football was back and Sevilla had a deserved 2-0 win on a night that was always likely to feel a little strange and in which it was victory enough to play. At the final whistle Ocampos pulled off his mask and leapt on Luuk de Jong\u2019s back. \u201cWe dedicate this to the fans who couldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said. At the start, the teams came out in single file, substitutes making their way to the stands in gloves and masks, occupying a handful of rows and sitting apart as the starters made their way to the pitch \u2013 a walk that looked a little lonely without the roar that\u2019s supposed to accompany them, especially on a night such as this. Giant lettering spelt out EL GRAN DERBI but there was little of what makes this game grand: the people. As the teams emerged and headed to their own half, no handshake and no posing for pictures, Sevilla\u2019s anthem played \u2013 recorded in advance and ringing around the wide, red space. There was a minute\u2019s silence before the game and then 90 minutes\u2019 silence during it. Unless you were on the other channel, where Spanish TV offered recorded sound and computer-generated fans, who didn\u2019t move much, more multicoloured backdrop than hardcore ultras. There was a game at least and it was good too, the pace quicker than might have been feared, the intensity announced by an early encounter between Sergio Reguil\u00f3n and Emerson by the corner flag. There was an early shout when Sevilla\u2019s goalkeeper, Tomas Vaclik, picked the ball up suspiciously near the edge of his area, but most of what unfolded did so at the other end. A Sergio Canales shot that did not trouble Vaclik was all that Betis produced in the opening 45 minutes. Sevilla produced more. Ocampos and Munir El Haddadi especially impressed, as their team opened out the pitch and moved on to the front foot. Ocampos\u2019s shot from a tight angle could be heard as it hit the bar after he wriggled through two challenges, and more chances followed. Jules Kound\u00e9 headed just wide at the near post, more alone from the corner than he had realised. De Jong, too, headed past the post, supplied by Munir\u2019s superb ball from the left. Just before half-time, De Jong turned cleverly and spread the ball to Ocampos, whose shot thudded against Joel Robles\u2019s palms. Just after, Joan Jord\u00e1n could not get his shot off, deep inside the area. Sevilla might have thought they would regret not taking those opportunities until 10 minutes later when Antonio Mateu Lahoz \u2013 welcome back to Spain\u2019s box-office referee \u2013 saw something in a crowd of jumping players and blew for a penalty. Replays showed Marc Bartra might have had just enough of a forearm on De Jong\u2019s neck to justify the decision, or at least to prevent the VAR overruling it. \u201cIncredible,\u201d Bartra called it. Ocampos scored and raced to the corner, while a sound engineer pressed the button marked cheer. He was followed by teammates, but not engulfed. That reticence soon evaporated when that magnificent second followed and Sevilla\u2019s superiority was sealed. Betis did react, Diego Lainez showing flashes of quality, Emerson putting one shot wide and Joaqu\u00edn seeing another blocked, but they had waited too long. Everyone else had waited three months and now, at last, the football is back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
