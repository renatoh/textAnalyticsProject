Seventeen years in the making, In the Lateness of the World (Bloodaxe \u00a310.99) is an act of witness, going repeatedly into the darkness of death and loss. It\u2019s no elegy for a pandemic, but it is a series of portraits of modern history and war: of manmade losses. There are massacres, refugees, and individuals who disappear alone into the turmoil of world events. Yet these fierce elegies are also beautiful: \u201cLight pealed, bell-like, through the canopy. Long ago or seems so. / Then the ghost of a deer and crows flapping through smoke.\u201d Forch\u00e9\u2019s almost incantatory way with image produces a strange tone, spell-bound but also emotionally charged, in which time and place shift and blur \u2013 because we\u2019re all implicated: \u201cEventually, we are all asked who we are. [\u2026] / All who come into the world are sent.\u201d Forch\u00e9\u2019s work speaks with deep certainty. At first reading, Jane Hirshfield\u2019s Ledger (Bloodaxe \u00a310.99) couldn\u2019t seem more different. It\u2019s a six-part volume of poems, many short, which often feel fractured or seem to struggle with what they have to say. But there\u2019s nothing tricksy about this intimate, tender free verse. As Hirshfield\u2019s title poem tells us, the most important measure of anything is its meaning, and Ledger is a compassionate look at \u2013 and yes, elegy for \u2013 \u201cour catalogued vanishing unfinished heaven\u201d. That \u201cheaven\u201d is the lost paradise of the natural world that we depredated even as we discovered it. Hirshfield perfectly captures our individual sense of lostness, faced with undeniable catastrophe, while invoking our collective responsibility: \u201cLet them not say: we did not see it. / We saw.\u201d Today\u2019s new publishing lists are giving readers what they want, though old habits of coverage can die hard. Disproportionately overlooked are non-metropolitan poets such as Ruth Stacey, whose second collection, the mysterious and fabular I, Ursula (V. Press \u00a310.99) appears from an award-winning West Midlands micropublisher. The book conjures a Dantesque lost forest, where foxes and wild children wrestle amid the spells and rhymes of oral tradition: \u201cApricot is the colour / of a setting ball of / flame, my beloved.\u201d But in this piercingly unsentimental report from Angela Carter territory, the most dangerous \u201cbeast\u201d is already \u201cin the house\u201d. Yves Bonnefoy (1923-2016) is a poet readers return to for major feats of imagination and consolation. Less well known to English readers is his prodigiously assorted prose, ranging from art history to the imaginative hinterland of L\u2019Arri\u00e8re-pays. So Yves Bonnefoy: Prose (Carcanet \u00a330), a selection expertly and economically edited by Stephen Romer, Anthony Rudolf and John Naughton, and translated by many distinguished hands, is an indispensable read. For Bonnefoy, poetry is \u201cborn of terror\u201d. Its job is \u201cto re-establish openness and this matters because of what such openness to thought and feeling offers us. Not least, hope: \u2018At the moment when so much night is gathering, could we be on the verge of the true light?\u2019\u201d \u2022 Fiona Sampson\u2019s Come Down is published by Corsair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
