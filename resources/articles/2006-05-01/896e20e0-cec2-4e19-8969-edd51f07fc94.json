There have been regular crossings to the continent from Channel ports since Julius Caesar was a young booze cruiser. And despite warnings that the Channel Tunnel and budget airlines would force ferry services out of business, they'll still be there again this summer, carrying holidaymakers and their cars to France. Selling themselves as a being a more comfortable, holiday-starts-here service, the ferries have staked out their own slice of the travel market, with 2.6m cars catching ferries from Dover last year. Part of that survival strategy has been to adopt the online price-checking approach of the budget airlines, with ferries using an internet booking system showing the options on times, dates and prices. For both Brittany Ferries and P&amp;O there are colour-coded booking systems showing low, medium and high-priced sailings, allowing the flexible traveller to navigate the cheapest deals. But another aspect of this budget airline approach is that the attention-grabbing headline price often bears little relation to the actual cost that most travellers will be paying. As with air fares, there are sharp differences between the highest and lowest ferry prices available, even on the same day. A single ticket in July for a car and two passengers from Dover to Calais with P&amp;O can be between \u00a330 and \u00a390 for sailings on the same day. This Dover-Calais route has competition between ferry operators, so there is a chance to hunt for the best price. But many of the routes are now served by a single ferry company - and if that seems to be excessively expensive, it's a case of weighing the cost against other options, such as the Channel Tunnel, or driving further to another port. Taking the findings of the price comparisons for the selected summer dates, it shows that the Dover to Boulogne route is cheapest, with little to choose in price between the operators on the Dover to Calais service. The shorter crossings from Dover are all substantially cheaper than the longer trip from Portsmouth. Bargain hunting How much do you want to pay to get the car across to France? It can be anything between \u00a350 and \u00a3400 return. The biggest key to getting a bargain for a Channel ferry crossing is being able to arrange travel times and dates to fit in with the lower-cost sailings. This means avoiding the school holidays, when prices are at their highest, travelling midweek rather than at weekends and opting for the less popular sailing times. This last point might save money - but a small voice of sanity might also say that this is meant to be a holiday and arriving exhausted and uncomfortable at a windswept ferry terminal at three in the morning isn't necessarily the best way of starting a fun-packed journey. It's meant to be a holiday, not a survival exercise. Nonetheless, anyone willing to take the graveyard-shift ferries, at three and four in the morning, will be able to get their car across to France for about \u00a325 and upwards. Another feature of the pricing structure is that there are cheaper deals available for shorter stays, typically five days or less, with further discounts for midweek. Looked at in a less optimistic light, this means that the holidaymaker wanting to go for a full week or more in the summer, probably with Saturday to Saturday accommodation booked, will get stung the hardest. There are other ways of cutting costs, though. Simply booking online can save you \u00a310 with Brittany Ferries and individual ferry companies have promotional deals. For example, Speed Ferries is currently offering 19,000 tickets at \u00a319 single, for a car and five passengers from Dover to Boulogne, on a first-come, first-served basis. Daytrip deals Ferry companies might like to use stylish images conjuring up the golden days of liners. But the reality on board is that they need to get people spending money in the ciggies, scent and booze shops. And there are deals offering very low fares for daytrippers, who the companies want to get on board to fill the tills in these floating off-licences. For instance, on the Portsmouth to Cherbourg route there is a \u00a320 day return fare. But these bargain-basement prices are designed with financial trip-wires for any customers wanting to use cheap day returns for longer stays. If you fail to use the return portion of the return within the time limit, the outward journey is then reclassified as a standard single, with the extra charge deducted directly from the payment card used to book the ferry. In another example of how to justify an expense as a bargain, P&amp;O says that people have been taking daytrips on the Dover to Calais route to fill their cars with cheaper fuel in France. This is a similar logic to those cross-Channel travellers who come back creaking with \"bargain\" crates of wine that they wouldn't have otherwise bought. And it's a strangely persuasive form of financial self-deception. Frequent floaters If you cross the Channel frequently, there are cheaper, season-ticket style discounts. On the Dover to Calais route, P&amp;O Ferries has a loyalty scheme in which passengers can buy five or more single tickets for \u00a330 (\u00a345 for trips longer than five days) for a car and passengers. These tickets are valid for one year. Speed Ferries has a frequent-user deal for Dover to Boulogne, offering 10 tickets (or five returns) at \u00a3250, for a car plus passengers. These will be valid for two years. And Eurotunnel sells 10 single tickets for \u00a3390, valid for one year. There is an additional supplement of up to \u00a330 for using peak-time trains. Even with the supplement, \u00a369 per ticket is considerably cheaper than the standard fare. Trains, planes and automobiles The most relevant cost comparison is often not between different ferries to France, but between taking the ferry and flying, or putting your car on the Eurotunnel service through the Channel Tunnel. This isn't just an equation on cost, it's also on time. The Eurotunnel trip is the quickest and, although not particularly scenic, it's a very efficient way of getting from one motorway network to the next. There are variations in price for Eurotunnel, depending on how anti-social you can be with the departure times, but in general it is more expensive than the Dover ferries. Prices range from \u00a349 to \u00a3199 for a single ticket. If the intention is to drive from the coast down towards southern France, then the comparison will be with budget air fares. A return ticket from London Stansted to Carcassonne costs about \u00a3100 upwards in the peak months with Ryanair. Flights from London Gatwick to Nice with easyJet are around \u00a3100. But these fares would have to be doubled if there are two travelling - and more if it's a family trip. And if you still needed a car to get around, car hire for a fortnight in Carcassonne is about \u00a3100 for a standard saloon. Foot passengers If you're travelling as a foot passenger without a car, you can get relatively cheaply across to France - the Dover to Calais service from Sea France charges \u00a324 return. But you've got to get to the harbour and, as an example, the standard open train fare from Birmingham to Dover costs \u00a376 (with cheaper fares for advance booking). And once you're in Calais, there will be more costs involved in travelling on to your next destination. This could make a Eurostar train from London Waterloo, with standard class return prices from about \u00a360 upwards, a more cost-effective route into France."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
