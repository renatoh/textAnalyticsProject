The east London drill rapper \u2013 and brother of Stefflon Don \u2013 assisted Tion Wayne and Stormzy to make I Dunno a contender for UK rap anthem of the year, and this debut mixtape is the victory lap. It restarts a career that began back in 2016 but was derailed by robbery and firearms charges, as he was held on remand and later acquitted. With the production values of a studio album, Dutch from the 5th takes drill into new, promising territory, with Dutchavelli\u2019s writing offering a rounded, context-rich perspective on the road life he came from. The production is ominous and evocative; chilling soundscapes that reflect the bleakness of Dutchavelli\u2019s writing. Kaka is elevated with an eerie electric guitar riff that feels lifted from a dystopian 80s film, while Skr on Em features a Ray BLK guest vocal that conjures memories of R&amp;B-inspired UK rap features from the 2000s \u2013 think Giggs\u2019s Blow Em Away featuring Shola Ama \u2013 but with a cadence only found in south London. His own voice is guttural throughout, and against the backdrop of those haunting beats, Dutchavelli knows how \u2013 and mostly when \u2013 to use it to say things that matter. At 26, he\u2019s one of drill\u2019s more mature MCs and that\u2019s keenly felt as he speaks about learned experiences and mistakes he\u2019s made. \u201cShe would\u2019ve been there in my darkest moments / she would\u2019ve been there at my highest heights / but I was tryna get rich off this China white,\u201d he raps on Darkest Moments. These moments of fragility are fleeting; the tape is bloated by tracks such as Surely and S Road Bop that provide jumpy, vibrant tempos but feel removed from his central observational position. They do offer balance though, and arguably make the moments of deeper reflection hit harder, including plainspoken details like those on Never Really Mine: \u201cDidn\u2019t wanna see me in Pentonville \u2026 I was on the run when I slept on your floor, told me you never wanna see me go back.\u201d Dutchavelli\u2019s tone is nuanced: pensive but not regretful, a man who can\u2019t change the past but now wants more out of life. Across the tape as a whole, he cuts through the imaginative production with a commanding yet empathic presence. After numerous stops and starts, a potentially major UK rap talent is finally up and running."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
