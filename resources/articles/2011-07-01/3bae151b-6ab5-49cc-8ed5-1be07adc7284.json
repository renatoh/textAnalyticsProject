Both \"reclusive\" \u2013 or just intensely private \u2013 and gestating movies over decades with intense perfectionism, each man has constructed a genre distinct unto itself, built on an instantly recognisable style and underpinned by complete creative control. But Malick's wispy, gossamer qualities, his organic, handheld imagery \u2013 always seeking wonder in harmony and balance \u2013 seem in total opposition to Kubrick's head-on, locked-down fish-eye compositions, his fanatically precise tracking-shots, sudden upsurges of brutal violence and abiding pessimism. But somehow they are united, yin-yang style, by Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, with which Malick seems to be in some kind of debate throughout The Tree Of Life. Picture the 24-year-old, philosophically-inclined, possibly zonked-out Malick seeing it for the first time in 1968, watching Kubrick vault, in a jump-cut, from the dawn of man and the invention of violence into meticulously realised space travel sequences, through the Stargate hallucination into a space beyond \u2026 uh, time and space. It stars a black monolith whose appearance portends quantum leaps in the evolution of consciousness, and 2001 itself has now become a monolithic movie \u2013 quantum leaps ahead of us still, perhaps \u2013 against which other film-makers dash their skulls productively. PT Anderson squared off with it in There Will Be Blood, Gaspar No\u00e9 was on a similar tack in the half-transcendent, half-moronic Enter The Void, and now comes Malick, with what seems to me almost an answer-movie. The sequences in The Tree Of Life that have sparked debate and scepticism come courtesy of Douglas Trumbull, the same effects wizard behind 2001, and show the origins of the cosmos and life on Earth \u2013 the Big Bang, asteroids, dinosaurs, the works \u2013 finally arriving in idyllic mid-50s Texas as our protagonist Jack (Sean Penn) is born. Somewhere in the middle of this sequence I realised that this may be the only American movie since 2001 brave or foolhardy enough to take on \u2013 to conflate, even \u2013 the infinite and the intimate, the cosmic and the cellular, the extraordinary and the infra-ordinary, all in Malick's habitual spirit of big-hearted, symphonic grandeur, steeped in Whitman, Emerson and Yeats. But to be honest, I also thought of the coffee-fuelled conversation about evolution that ends Barry Levinson's Diner: \"... and after all of that, cell by cell over eternity, and you end up with some guy on a street corner with a newspaper yellin', 'Taxi!'\" Perhaps occasional risibility is sometimes the price of reaching not simply for the stars, but for the event-horizon.
