When their travelling supporters rubbed their eyes and saw their team 3-0 down after 28 minutes of the first-leg of the play-off against Young Boys back in August, they feared that nights like these would be denied them. The continent, conceivably, might have missed out on the spectacle of Gareth Bale ripping opposition defenders to shreds, of Tottenham's vim and vigour and of their never-say-die spirit. Instead, Harry Redknapp's players battled back against the Swiss and have since advertised their potential to a captivated audience. The club's debut Champions League campaign has been marked by emotion and a sense of adventure. No-one will forget the ties against Internazionale, in particular, but now, things have become interesting. This stroll against crisis-hit Werder Bremen ensured safe passage into the last 16 but Redknapp spoke afterwards of his desire to beat FC Twente in two weeks' time to ensure his team would advance as group winners. Excitement and ambition crackles in these parts. Tottenham's journey has allowed their crowd to dream and they see no reason to fear anybody, particularly as White Hart Lane has come to resemble a fortress and players such as Bale and Luka Modric have shone when the spotlight has been at its most intense. \"We almost came unstuck against Young Boys, we were lucky to survive but then the aim was to get out of the group,\" Redknapp said. \"Now, it is to win the group. Looking around, I think it would be a big advantage to finish top. We have to keep going and then, who knows? We've got some outstanding players here, who could play for any team.\" Chief among that group is Bale, who shone with his strength, driving runs and wicked deliveries. The only blot on his evening was a missed penalty early in the second-half. Bale did everything but score, hitting the woodwork twice, once from a curling 25 yard free-kick, and dragging another shot just past the far post. The Lane rose as one to acclaim him when Redknapp substituted him in the 80th minute. Clemens Fritz might have joined in the applause \u2013 the one-time Germany international had become the latest right-back to be tormented by the Welshman. When Fritz was booked just before the interval for pulling Bale back, it was one of the few times that he got close to him. Redknapp could even savour a clean sheet for only the third time this season and a command performance from William Gallas. When the former Arsenal defender stifled Marko Marin, Werder's only dangerous player, in a second-half one-on-one, the home fans saluted him as one of their own. It felt like a symbolic moment. Redknapp likened Gallas's work to that of Bobby Moore against Brazil's Jairzinho at the 1970 World Cup. Werder had arrived with serious concerns over their collective form and fitness and the early goal they conceded further sapped their confidence. Aaron Lennon, in yards of space, got to the by-line and cut back for Younes Kaboul to hammer a right-footed volley down into the ground and past the goalkeeper Tim Wiese. Kaboul is on fire in front of goal. He was still basking in the afterglow of his winner against Arsenal on Saturday. Now this.Peter Crouch and Roman Pavlyuchenko, twice, spurned chances to extend the advantage before Modric deflated Werder with a goal on the stroke of half-time, a close-range finish after Crouch's knock-down. The second-half became a procession. Heurelho Gomes was not extended and Redknapp could be vexed only when he substituted Pavlyuchenko. The Russia striker was not happy and threw his gloves to the ground before marching past Redknapp without a sideways glance. \"He really got aggressive there, Pav,\" Redknapp said, sarcastically. \"I thought, Pav, what's happening?' I thought he was going to throw the gloves at me. I just don't know why he didn't take the penalty. He gave it to Gareth.\" The penalty was awarded for a trip by the debutant Felix Kroos on Modric but Bale's kick was too close to Wiese. It was Tottenham's third penalty miss of the season. , following Rafael Van Der Vaart's against FC Twente and Pavlyuchenko's against Blackburn Rovers.Crouch and the substitute Jermain Defoe also went close in the second-half before the former wrapped up the victory. After Bale's crossed had bounced off the crossbar, Lennon returned it for Crouch to steer home. Redknapp said Jermaine Jenas had been withdrawn with a calf problem but the foot injury that ruled out Van der Vaart was not serious and Michael Dawson is also set to return to training on Friday. Momentum is with Tottenham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
