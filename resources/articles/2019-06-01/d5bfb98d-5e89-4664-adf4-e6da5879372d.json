Himid, whose work focuses on colonial history, racism and institutional invisibility, was both the first black woman to win and, at 63, the oldest winner in the Turner prize\u2019s 33-year history. She said her firsts had given her hope that things were finally changing in the art world. \u201cBeing the first black woman was a bit bittersweet, because there are many black women that have been up for it in the recent history of the prize\u2026 I was happy to win it, but it was bittersweet. \u201cWhat people have said to me is that it gave people hope that things were changing.\u201d She has called on people to build on this progress to make the art world a fairer place. The artist, born in Zanzibar, said that at the beginning of her career, \u201cWe were not on the television, we were not in the newspapers, unless something drastic and dangerous happened. I guess the notion of black people being artists was completely alien to people in the British art world. Someone actually said to me \u2018black people don\u2019t make art\u2019.\u201d Himid\u2019s prizewinning work included pages from the Guardian featuring images of black people. She said the work, which dissects pictures and headlines for unconscious racial stereotyping, stemmed from her frustration at how black people were depicted. Last year Himid, who is also professor of contemporary art at Central Lancashire University, was invited to the Guardian for a three-day residency that brought her face to face with staff responsible for producing a newspaper. She ran a debrief session to share what she had learned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
