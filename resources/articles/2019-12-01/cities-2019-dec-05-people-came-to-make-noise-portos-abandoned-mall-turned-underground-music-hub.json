Initially a three-storey car park, then a thriving shopping centre, the building has more recently suffered from years of neglect. Its walls are sprayed with graffiti and plastered with stickers, and the windows are blacked out. But listen closely and you can hear the windows rattle to the sound of drums and electric guitars from dozens of rock, funk, blues and jazz bands. Diogo Azevedo, singer of the thrash metal band Jarda, is one of an estimated 300 musicians and artists who helped turn Centro Comercial Stop \u2013 known as Stop \u2013 into a unique, and controversial, music studio complex. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the underground scene in Porto,\u201d Azevedo says, attractive to its bohemian occupants, but a headache for city hall. Porto\u2019s authorities claim the building is illegal: it was never intended to be a music studio, they say, and it fails to comply with modern safety requirements. The musicians feel differently. For the past 10 years they have battled to keep the building open, citing its cultural relevancy at a time when locals feel they\u2019ve been priced out of the city by the ever-increasing demand from tourism. \u201cWe have so many friends here,\u201d Azevedo says. \u201cWe rehearse, jam. It ends up being a waste if this place was demolished to be one of many other hotels in Porto.\u201d The car park first became a mall in 1982, one of dozens that sprouted like mushrooms across the city following the collapse of the Second Republic. Locals flocked to the cinema and top-floor dance hall. But new, larger, out-of-town complexes in the 1990s saw many of Porto\u2019s businesses, customers and residents relocate to the suburbs. Shutters were pulled down over large areas of the city. Helena Fernandes remembers her first visit to the abandoned mall. \u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw how shopping was in the golden days and this was empty.\u201d Fernandes, 44, is president of Batucada Radical, a Brazilian street percussion band. \u201cWe came here because nobody wanted us in other places,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are very loud. We stayed for six months rehearsing in one place, and people asked us to get out. We were like nomads.\u201d In Stop they saw an opportunity. They negotiated cheap rates and, along with other musicians, transformed the storefronts in amateur rehearsal and recording studios. \u201cBands came here to rehearse because it was very cheap,\u201d says Nuno Mendes, 45, a musician and producer based on the building\u2019s second floor. \u201cNo one wanted to come here, because it has these hallways [with] drug addicts; it started to be a bit underground. People came here because they could make some noise. \u201cIt was crazy. There were lots of heavy metal bands that started \u2013 rock, punk. The building trembled. It\u2019s weird because your neighbour is the one who blows out your ears. You get louder, then your neighbour gets louder \u2013 it was like a war. Who plays louder!\u201d Many of the musical groups are collectives \u2013 Fernandes\u2019 began with 20 members but now has more than 100. The venue, she says, has been \u201ca turning point\u201d for the group. \u201cWith rents as they are now, it would be impossible to get a place like this,\u201d she says. The artists\u2019 appetite for loud music, late-night drinking and in some cases antisocial behaviour have somewhat strained relations with the local community. \u201cIt was like a Noah\u2019s Ark where all the animals were inside,\u201d says Jorge Prendas, a coordinator at the music venue Casa da M\u00fasica, which rented two studios in Stop. \u201cPolice went there three or four times to close it. They had a very good argument: it was not safe.\u201d But authorities couldn\u2019t close it, because of a quirk: the building has never had an owner, so legal responsibility fell on the dozens of individual landlords of the various retail spaces. The sales of these shopfronts, however, were unregulated, and authorities in many cases don\u2019t know the owners, let alone how to track them down. Without clear ownership or maintenance, the building slid into disrepair. The escalator and air conditioning clunked to a halt, toilets were badly damaged and water leaked from ceilings. To improve acoustics, musicians glued cardboard egg cartons and sponges to walls, but this only amplified the fire risk \u2013 in a building with no fire exits or sprinklers, at a time when unsafe electrical usage in the building was surging. \u201cThe [electrics were] very old and not reliable,\u201d Prendas says. \u201cYou had one plug and 20 instruments in that plug [and] lots and lots of adapters.\u201d By 2010, with rumours spreading that the then mayor\u2019s patience was wearing thin, dozens of musicians formed the Pro-Stop Association and reached out to Prendas. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have authorisation to do musical rehearsals there and they didn\u2019t have the license for the building,\u201d he says. \u201c[Casa da M\u00fasica] wanted to promote their image \u2013 to show that we are on the side of the musicians and artists.\u201d The group was called StopEstra (from \u201cStop\u201d and \u201corchestra\u201d), and for its launch it staged a 21-band performance across the city, performing nonstop for six hours before convening at Casa da M\u00fasica the next night as a unified 100-piece rock band. The British composer and director Tim Steiner, who conducted the group that evening, says the experience was \u201can extraordinary thing\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been working for 30 years in community-grounded music projects around the world and there\u2019s nothing like StopEstra\u201dsays Steiner, a former professor at the London Guildhall School of Music. \u201cThere was a real understanding between all the musicians \u2013 a lot of respect \u2013 and a sense of experimentation and exploration of what you could do when you have a large group of rock musicians together.\u201d The megagroup performed seven more times over the next six years, including as the opening act for the first Porto edition of the Primavera Sound music festival in 2012, and had appeared to secure the building\u2019s future. A fire in 2017, however, gutted four studios and once again drew the attention of city hall. A new organisation, Alma Stop, fronted by the Portuguese singer Manel Cruz, was formed to defend the building\u2019s case \u2013 but it was a hard sell after the fire. \u201cThe biggest problem is the musicians,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for them to believe the truth. People can die here, we have to understand that.\u201d To appease the council, the organisation agreed to a rule whereby landlords would question the \u201cacoustic suitability\u201d of their tenants. Sofia Mestre and Rita S\u00f3 accepted a 10pm curfew on playing the drums. \u201cWe know people live the other side of the street,\u201d they say. \u201cWe play folk music and don\u2019t [make] much noise.\u201d Other musicians have moved on to more professional digs. Jo\u00e3o Brand\u00e3o used to rehearse here as a teenager, but has gone on to establish Plataforma Campanh\u00e3, a \u20ac1.7m (\u00a31.45m) production hub with music studios, production rooms and a training academy for studio engineers and production staff. \u201cIt\u2019s the same concept\u201d as Stop, he says. \u201cWe wanted to get together and share ideas and work together but in a more professional space. We knew that people needed a good studio in Portugal \u2013 a professional studio with good-quality equipment, good acoustics. \u201cStop is a great thing, but it\u2019s more of a rehearsal space and DIY. What we did learn in Porto is [that] people get along and willing to cooperate \u2013 and that was proven by Stop.\u201d City hall is much more supportive of the new, slicker venture, leasing a room for its vinyl library \u2013 35,000 LPs donated by two radio stations \u2013 with plans for community events and podcasts. Guilherme Blanc, head of contemporary art and film at the Porto Municipality for Culture, hopes Stop could soon do the same, as part of the city\u2019s multimillion-euro investment in culture. \u201cThe space doesn\u2019t follow the necessary rules for public use. It\u2019s not a public building \u2013 it\u2019s an illegal building,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what we want is to save the building for its current use, and that\u2019s our goal. \u201c[We are] committed at the highest level to do whatever we can to fix the situation and save it. Culture-wise, the answer is given: let\u2019s keep Stop open. [But] nobody can be in a position to be personally responsible for any accident that happens there. Follow the law, or it will close.\u201d To Fernandes, Stop is about what Porto means to its residents \u2013 particularly its poorer artists and musicians \u2013 at a time when the city is growing. \u201cTourism is good,\u201d she says, \u201cit gives money, great industry, businesses around it, but we must draw a line. The centre of Porto is not for the people of Porto any more. Stop is a privileged place.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
