The kids can do that. Skinner\u2019s new standup set \u2013 in situ for a month \u2013 is almost aggressively irrelevant and digressive. It amounts to nothing more than an old bloke moseying around the stage until his time is up, telling disconnected jokes about whatever happens to amuse him. As such, it\u2019s very funny indeed. Skinner is the archetypal comic with \u201cfunny bones\u201d. You can believe he\u2019s really amused by life, by himself \u2013 and by his audience. His stillnesses are forever pregnant with the next joke. The mot juste seldom eludes him, although there\u2019s never any heavy lifting. \u201cWell, I was taken aback,\u201d he understates, after Richard Madeley announces to him at a party that he doesn\u2019t bother with underpants. The mildness of Skinner\u2019s surprise becomes a delightful part of the joke. That story arrives in a short routine about celebrity gossip \u2013 the genesis, perhaps, of the tour, titled Showbiz, he plans for later this year. But the subject is no more prominent than, say, ageing or recent fatherhood. Or Star Wars: there\u2019s a gag about shrivelled Jedi master Yoda that isn\u2019t just apropos of nothing, but hasn\u2019t been apropos of anything for 20 years. In Skinner\u2019s hands, the arbitrariness is part of its charm. The richest routine, at least for longtime fans of this ex-king of lad comedy, is the one about his fading libido. (\u201cFree at last!\u201d) It leads to a gag uniting those improbable bedfellows, Nicole Scherzinger and \u201cDerbyshire neck\u201d. And to a droll joke about the unterrifying nature of \u201cthe curse of Strictly.\u201d But the non sequitur skits are often just as irresistible, such as the beautifully deadpanned one imagining what movies would be like if characters ever had to repeat themselves for clarity. The show meanders, takes its time, goes nowhere fast \u2013 and, tonight at least, reaps big laughs. \u2022 At Leicester Square theatre, London, until 4 July. At Assembly George Square, Edinburgh, from 31 July until 18 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
