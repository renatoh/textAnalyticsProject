Nagujja is one of about 15 women in gingham aprons who are jumping in the air in elation, clapping, finger-clicking and ululating as Stella Nyanzi weaves her way through bubbling pots of groundnut sauce, beans and matooke. Some of them chant \u201cNnalongo! Nnalongo!\u201d \u2013 the name given to mothers of twins in Buganda culture. Nyanzi\u2019s twin boys, Wasswa and Kato, 13, and her daughter, Baraka, 15, trail behind their mother holding a roll of Kampala Woman MP campaign posters and a large bucket of paste. The teenagers look tired; their mother\u2019s life has been a whirlwind the past few years, from her naked protests to stints in police cells and prison. Nyanzi is a feminist anthropologist focused on African sexuality and gender, including work with LGBT+ communities \u2013 a controversial area of research in Uganda. She has become better known for her writing and activism. In February, she was released from Luzira prison, where she had been detained for almost 16 months for writing a poem about Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni\u2019s mother\u2019s vagina. Posted on Facebook like much of her other writings, the poem uses graphic language to criticise Museveni\u2019s near 35-year rule \u2013 a subversive tactic known as \u201cradical rudeness.\u201d Now, Uganda\u2019s rudest feminist is entering politics as the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) opposition party candidate for Kampala Woman MP (a parliamentary seat in the city). The Guardian joined her on the campaign trail on a day which took her through the bustling market, into the office of the city\u2019s lord mayor (a colonial throwback), up the stairs of the rundown FDC constituency office, and inside the shiny studios of Radio Simba, a Luganda language station hosting a show with Nyanzi and her opponents. When Nyanzi\u2019s first opponent arrives and greets her warmly, she jokes: \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be friends!\u201d and then starts growling at her. \u201cI\u2019ve been advised by my strategists to be more palatable. Not everyone can bite my cookie,\u201d grins Nyanzi, whose Facebook posts have become less risque during her political campaign, \u201cbut if it\u2019s necessary I will use that [graphic] language.\u201d Nyanzi recounts her recent TV appearance when she attacked Museveni. \u201cI said something in Luganda which basically translates as, \u2018I won\u2019t groan in pleasure to a man who is fucking me badly\u2019. \u201cThey were horrified and scandalised!\u201d While she acknowledges that some voters are put off by such exchanges, this style does win her support. \u201cI think people who got the image, however graphic, understood it \u2026 I\u2019m talking about abuse of power, and how we as Ugandans respond to it.\u201d As we walk through the market under the blazing sun, some vendors shout another name Nyanzi is often called \u2013 Nnalongo ow\u2019ennenne \u2013 meaning \u201ca mother of twins with a big vagina\u201d, an epithet with roots in a traditional naming ceremony for twins. \u201cThe name kind of works when I\u2019m with people who don\u2019t take life too seriously. It\u2019s good fun, and by using the name people are allowing themselves to be invited into my obscene graphic language, and they\u2019re saying: \u2018We are comrades.\u2019\u201d Nyanzi listens to concerns about infrastructure and sanitation, and street traders talk to her about Kampala Capital City Authority\u2019s (KCCA) crackdown on their livelihoods. While some members of the public tell her they will only vote for Shamim Malende, her opponent representing presidential candidate Bobi Wine\u2019s party, most seem keen on Nyanzi. \u201cStella fought for university students when their tuition fees were being raised,\u201d says Francis Katende, 54, a one-legged hat seller. \u201cShe has been fighting for the underprivileged for a long time, so we know she will fight for the disabled too.\u201d Selling biscuits on the roadside, Hanifa Nantegga, 32, says that, \u201cStella is going to win this election because she is a woman, and a very vocal one. Even before she contested she was fighting for the people and was vocal about all the major issues we face.\u201d That \u201cvocal\u201d nature is what Nyanzi believes is her strength: \u201cThe best I can do for voters, such as the ones in the market who told me about issues with taxes, sanitation, schools, is voice their issues in parliament.\u201d But she is under no illusion of how much direct change she can enact as an MP. \u201cI don\u2019t think parliament will put food on their tables, or remove Museveni from power, or stop the police brutality,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut it will allow me to go and speak with clarity about these issues, and I will be taken more seriously than just \u2018that protester\u2019, \u2018that activist\u2019, \u2018that Facebooker\u2019.\u201d Nyanzi hopes that being an MP will protect her \u201cability to stand up and criticise the dictator\u201d. Since the start of Uganda\u2019s Covid lockdown in March, she has been arrested five times, mainly for staging or taking part in protests. Her assistant, Roy Rugumayo, shows scars on his wrists caused by tight handcuffs during a recent detention. \u201cAll of my trauma from prison has prepared me to face police arrests and detention much more easily,\u201d says Nyanzi, but her children have staged their own protests against this at home, writing her essays and \u201cholding conferences\u201d outlining their concerns about her work. \u201c\u2018Why are you sacrificing so much for Uganda?\u2019 they ask. Uganda doesn\u2019t care, Uganda is not your child.\u201d Each time she is arrested Baraka is on the phone asking, \u201cWhat does she need? Panties? A toothbrush? And then she packs them and gives them to my driver. I feel sad, but she\u2019s quickly taken charge.\u201d Protests are Nyanzi\u2019s comfort zone \u2013 it is electoral politics that seem daunting. Previous Ugandan elections have been marred by allegations of vote buying, rigging and fraud. Speaking into a microphone at the market for disabled people, Nyanzi tells the vendors she has no money to give them \u2013 often an expectation \u2013 but that she \u201cpledges her service\u201d. \u201cIf somebody pays for your vote, that person will not remember you when they go to the parliament, because they have already paid you,\u201d she says. But she will remember them if she wins, she says, and even gives out her number. At the FDC constituency office, wood-panelled walls give a sense of grandeur \u2013 but the room is basically empty and the ceiling has damp stains. Posters of the party\u2019s former leader, Kizza Besigye, are stuck on windows. \u201cI thought it would be interesting for you to see the office because for me it suggests two things,\u201d Nyanzi says. \u201cEither we are very poor, and we cannot afford plush furnishings, or have been raided so many times it\u2019s not worth investing in furniture and computers and stuff like that.\u201d Nyanzi\u2019s strategists tell her that, \u201clots of people can vote you in, but you won\u2019t be the winner because of rigging\u201d. But they talk her through some practical ways to prevent rigging, such as hiring an agent at each polling station \u201cto observe the process and receive tallies on our behalf\u201d. While she is grateful for the support of her small team, we talk about the fact that they are all men, and how well her personal values align with her party\u2019s. \u201cThree-quarters of my personal agenda would be thrown out by my party. If they knew, for example, that I want to interrogate the law around inheritance rights for women,\u201d she says, listing gender, sexual minorities, reproductive health and police brutality as among the issues close to her heart. These topics are not the focus for many Kampalans, but she has her own way of incorporating them. She has LGBT team members; her proposer for the nominations was a transgender man. \u201cHe\u2019s in the voter\u2019s register as Susan, but he appears as Noah. When we went to the electoral commission to verify our signatures I was just waiting for somebody to raise the issue,\u201d she says, looking pleased. For Nyanzi, the freedom afforded to an aspiring MP \u2013 to go on TV and radio and criticise Museveni without being arrested \u2013 is a win. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be successful, whether I\u2019m going to win or lose. And I think for me, that is not the most important thing,\u201d she admits. \u201cThe important thing is that Stella Nyanzi was able to get released from jail, and she came and stood and contested as a member of parliament. That was a win.\u201d Additional reporting by Patience Bugiri"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
