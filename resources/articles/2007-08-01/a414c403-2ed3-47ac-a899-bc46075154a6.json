That is the intriguing question posed by today's Guardian survey of spending announcements made since the new prime minister took up the reins, with big-ticket commitments including \u00a33bn for housing, \u00a34bn for early-years education and \u00a3400m for student grants. Compared with May, when the transition got under way, ICM - in line with other pollsters - registers an increase in Labour's vote share of seven points. But with a total of \u00a339bn of expenditure unveiled, does it follow that each one of those polling points has cost the country more than \u00a35bn? Not quite. Gordon Brown has, after all, made some of his biggest waves with moves that have little to do with resources: on the constitution and on gambling, for instance, the change is a matter of tone. Nor is the largesse quite what it seems, as experienced Brown watchers have spotted. In Labour's first term the then chancellor double-counted much public spending, and - even though ministers are now less brazen about it - the smoke and mirrors are back in play. Take the trumpeted \u00a37.7bn increase in defence. It is swollen by lumping several years together and failing to strip out inflation: the real defence increase between 2008 and 2011 is just \u00a31.5bn. With rail, despite talk of a \u00a315bn investment, far from offering a bribe to the commuter belt, the recent white paper states that public funding will fall, while the contribution of passengers - that is, the fares - will rise. However ingeniously the numbers are crunched, after years of expansion, public services are set for parsimony. The Treasury's golden rule is set to be met only because public spending will shrink as a share of the economy. Assuming the NHS receives what Mr Brown's advisers previously said was the minimum required, the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that other areas awaiting their settlement - including housing and the environment - will on average get something close to a freeze. Tony Blair had to work round a Treasury that was secretive towards him about what could be afforded and when. Mr Brown faces no such restrictions and so has been free to add extra spring to his bounce by bringing forward, from the autumn spending review, announcements about how the modest cash available will be spent. But each pound earmarked now for new policies, such as expanded student grants, is a pound that cannot be spent later. Mr Brown may improve public services by running them more calmly than Mr Blair. What he cannot do, however - at least without tax rises - is transform the resources they have. Announcements brought forward and big-sounding numbers cannot alter that underlying reality. But they may flatter the polls for a while."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
