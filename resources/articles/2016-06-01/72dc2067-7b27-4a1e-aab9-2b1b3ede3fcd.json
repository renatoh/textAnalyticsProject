Among the editors in the front row, however, sartorial patriotism was noticeably absent. Instead, V\u00eatements \u2013 the Parisian streetwear label notorious for putting a T-shirt with the DHL logo on the catwalk \u2013 was the buzz brand. Founded by Georgian-born designer Demna Gvasalia as a collective in 2014, V\u00eatements has become the last word in cool by doing away with hackneyed concepts of Parisian chic. Borrowing from street culture, branding and the deconstruction pioneered by designers in the 1990s, it regularly puts on shows in distinctly inelegant venues \u2013 including a Chinese restaurant \u2013 with friends of the designers as models. Some pieces are deliberately unisex and the hoodies \u2013 oversized and often with the kinds of visual gags that play well on social media \u2013 are the it item in London for this week. Editors, bloggers and designers wore them, and one participant was spotted wearing a fleece actually from logistics company DHL. Sweatshirts with gothic script on the sleeves were popular, and Luke Day, editor of GQ Style, wore a design with the logo of sportswear brand Champion reworked to say V\u00eatements. He says there\u2019s an insider exclusivity that those in the know \u2013 and on the front row \u2013 will understand, even if passersby see just another hoodie with a logo. \u201cThe branded items have a very ironic pop-culture feel but are expensive,\u201d said Day. \u2018That makes them exclusive and covetable. They\u2019re clothes for Instagram.\u201d Even when the labels didn\u2019t say V\u00eatements, the influence was there. Where once the suits and pocket squares of traditional British tailoring dominated, now the mood was streety casual, with hoodies, trainers and tracksuit trousers by labels including St\u00fcssy and Palace. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that V\u00eatements is more real,\u201d said Rob Nowill of fashion website style.com. \u201cMen are tired of suits: they don\u2019t feel modern. There\u2019s not such a line between streetwear and fashion now.\u201d Nick Grimshaw, the radio DJ and London Collections ambassador, wore a hoodie for House of Holland\u2019s presentation on Friday, and even model Oliver Cheshire \u2013 known for his suited and booted style \u2013 had a sporty look. He wore a cream knitted hooded top yesterday. \u201cFashion has become more functional. I feel like I can wear something like this to a show now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also there in the City. Friends of mine who used to wear suits to work are now about to wear more relaxed clothes.\u201d London menswear designers could be credited with starting the trend Gvasalia and V\u00eatements have crystallised. British design duo Agi &amp; Sam featured bomber jackets in their collection, while models at Nasir Mazhar showed tracksuits and cargo pants as part of a street-style-influenced look. Christopher Raeburn\u2019s collaboration with German accessories brand MCM had an outdoorsy influence, with hooded ponchos and macs in dazzle print. The men\u2019s shows continue, with JW Anderson and Grace Wales Bonner highlights on the schedule."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
