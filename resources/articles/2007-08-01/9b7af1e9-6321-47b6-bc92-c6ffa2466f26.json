He was not the only one. Ian Botham and Ravi Shastri both concurred. What madness. If ever a pitch and a day exhorted \"bat first\" then this was it. Sri Lanka's Arjuna Ranatunga might have bucked the trend here in 1998 when inserting England but he had a one-man attack called Muttiah Muralitharan which required resting between innings. If Muralitharan had bowled the 113.5 overs he eventually proffered in Sri Lanka's 10-wicket victory without the intervening respite of his team's 591 he might never have bowled again. Anil Kumble may also suffer a heavy burden here but that did not worry Dravid yesterday. And as Wasim Jaffer began crashing boundaries to all parts you could hear the whispers about The Oval pitch: \"Boy, this is flat\", they were saying. The England fielders would never have admitted as much, but it would have been entirely understandable if, at the back of many their minds, was that dreaded thought: \"This is going to be a seriously long day\". Ah, the joys of six hours of purgatory; on your feet all that time, scurrying here, there and everywhere, then reluctantly putting your aching body in an ice bath, grabbing a bite to eat, crashing into bed and arising to the prospect of the same tortuous routine again. Spare a thought for England's weary warriors this morning. However, it is to his credit that the England captain Michael Vaughan does not do such negative notions. Such genuflection is simply not in his make-up. Few captains let the game drift less than the ever- tinkering, thinking Vaughan. India had reached 58 for nought off 14 overs at the first drinks break when Vaughan gathered his men to hatch a plan: the \"bang-it-in-short\" plan. Not exactly Bodyline but a swift examination of the short-ball techniques of Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik. Short-leg and leg gully were posted but, when Jaffer nonchalantly pulled Anderson through mid-wicket, the groans went up: \"What is that rubbish?\" So too again when the next short one was wide outside off-stump. Jaffer cut with that Zorro-esque flourish of his and we, the unsuspecting and unwary observers, awaited the umpire's signal for four, maybe even six, like that previous effort. But no, lurking down at third man some distance in from the boundary, was the perfectly positioned Kevin Pietersen. The ball sought him out and a wicket was England's, nay Vaughan's, for his ingenuity. If only every scheme worked as such. Sachin Tendulkar was peppered around the rib cage as he has been all series - caught at leg gully off Chris Tremlett at Trent Bridge remember - but would not comply. So Vaughan changed tack. Now came the Ryan Sidebottom treatment outside off-stump. On his home ground the Nottinghamshire left-armer had tormented the Little Master in that area without reward, but when Tendulkar had reached 20 here Sidebottom felt he had his man. The edged drive went to wicketkeeper Matt Prior's right at a comfortable height but wide enough to precipitate a dive. Prior, going with both hands, shelled it. Bad timing. Prior received criticism at and after Trent Bridge for his volubility. He needed a performance here to silence those critics for his glovework has not been slick all summer. He conceded 48 byes in the West Indies series and 58 have now slipped past him in this series. Sympathy can be extended for some wayward bowling but it appears more that Prior's technique is being slightly exposed. He is a disciple of Peter Moores, the former wicketkeeper whose dictum preaches minimal feet movement to allow for the ball swinging after it passes the bat. Prior has thus been encouraged to stand more still and take the ball almost in his midriff, backing himself to dive if the ball drifts wide. One can understand the theory; it is just that Prior is not executing it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
