The breadth of Lynch\u2019s creative interests will be on full display this week at the Manchester international festival, where the 73-year-old presents a special season of screenings, live music and talks at the city\u2019s Home arts centre, alongside his first major UK exhibition of visual art. Lynch was born in Montana and grew up in various parts of the white-picket-fence middle America he would later interrogate in his films. He studied painting in Philadelphia before making a transition to experimental cinema. His 1977 debut, Eraserhead, became a cult classic and paved the way for The Elephant Man, which was nominated for eight Oscars, and a big-budget adaptation of Dune, a painful flop on its release in 1984. Over time Lynch\u2019s films have become increasingly oblique, culminating in the fractured fever dream of Inland Empire (2006), though his 1999 road movie, The Straight Story, was unexpectedly linear and tender-hearted, steering clear of the violence and depravity that marks much of his work. Lynch hasn\u2019t directed a film in 13 years, and it\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019ll ever go back to Hollywood, though his 18-episode return to Twin Peaks in 2017 threw up enough mysteries to keep his diehard fans occupied for years to come. On a video link from his Los Angeles home, Lynch \u2013 dressed in a trademark black shirt and full of beans after a morning\u2019s meditation and coffee drinking \u2013 discussed some of the more outlandish responses to Twin Peaks, as well as Brexit, his love of factories, and why the chickens are coming home to roost for America. What should we expect from your season at the Manchester international festival? My participation is paintings, drawings, lithographs and some sculpture. They\u2019ve done a great job hanging the show \u2013 it\u2019s going to look very sharp. And then my friend Chrysta Bell [the Texan musician who plays FBI agent Tammy Preston in Twin Peaks: The Return] is going to be there with some music [hosting live performances by Anna Calvi, These New Puritans and Hatis Noit]. There\u2019s a cinema section too, including films that have influenced you over the years, such as 8\u00bd, The Wizard of Oz, Sunset Boulevard. Why are these important to you? Federico Fellini is one of the all-time great film-makers and 8\u00bd is maybe my favourite of his \u2013 I did a whole series of lithographs based on the last scenes in that movie. The Wizard of Oz is a cosmic film and meaningful on many, many different levels, and Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of the most beautiful songs ever. And I deeply love Sunset Boulevard for how it captures the golden age of Hollywood and its fall. It\u2019s just a great Hollywood story. According to the press notes, some of your artworks in the show are inspired by Manchester\u2019s industrial history. I don\u2019t know about that. I went to northern England in the 90s on a search for factories, because I love to photograph factories and I always heard that northern England had the ultimate factories. Even though I\u2019ve never been a factory worker, for some reason I just love the idea of smokestacks, fire, the brick, the narrow streets, the whole factory life. But the trip was very depressing, because when I got up there it was really too late. They were tearing down a smokestack a week and the old factories were disappearing, replaced by pathetic, corrugated metal buildings, with cows in the fields where the factories once were. I guess it\u2019s good for the environment but it\u2019s bad for photography, I\u2019ll tell you that. You\u2019ve often described creative ideas as fish. Are the fish biting at the moment? Well, as you know if you ever fished, you have to have patience \u2013 some days you catch some, some days you don\u2019t. I am fishing now, and I\u2019m gathering fish together, but I haven\u2019t started cooking them. Right now, I\u2019d say the ideas are in the world of sculpture and painting. Do have everything you need at home to make work, to the point that you don\u2019t really need to leave? I\u2019ve got everything. Though I would like to have a giant soundstage, and much more room for storage and building \u2013 a mini-studio. But now, thanks to the digital world, it\u2019s becoming possible to build an entire world right at your desk. Is that a good thing, even if it means going out into the world less? I don\u2019t like going out anyway. I like to stay at home. Of course I do think it\u2019s important sometimes to go out and see new things and feel the so-called reality. And that can conjure ideas. But I think human beings can sense the air and feel what\u2019s going on in the world without going out. I haven\u2019t been over to England recently, but I can feel this Brexit thing, I can feel the torment. It\u2019s a deeply strange situation. Nobody really thought you\u2019d want to exit [the EU]. It is a terrible disaster. Totally nuts\u2026 And I can feel in the world, there are many, many gigantic problems. Do you feel that we\u2019re living in particularly dark times? No, I feel we\u2019ve been in very dark times and much better times are coming. The thing is, bad news sells, frightening things sell, sensationalism sells. So we don\u2019t hear all the good news that\u2019s happening, because it seems kind of boring. But I think there are so many good things happening, and people thinking and inventing. I think the future\u2019s looking very bright. Even in the US, where there\u2019s so much concern about political divisions and inequality? I think, in a way, the chickens are coming home to roost for America. I don\u2019t know what percentage [of people] are working towards making it better, but there\u2019s a huge percentage that\u2019s being diverted into escape, into sports or movies or music, into drugs. The drugs have ruined so much. Do you see it as your role as an artist and a film-maker to counteract this in some way, to shake people up? Absolutely not, because then you end up making a message film. You see, I get ideas in fragments, and only when a bunch of fragments come together I say: \u201cOh, this is about this, or this could be about this.\u201d But there\u2019s absolutely no message, no steering anyone any which way. I just love the idea. I want to realise them because I\u2019m in love with them. As ideas appear in your head, especially the weirder, darker ones, do you ever ask yourself: \u201cWhere the hell did that come from?\u201d Many times. I don\u2019t know where any of them come from. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think I can take credit for anything I\u2019ve ever done. They\u2019re all little gifts and they string themselves together, and stories come out or a painting comes out. They just come into your head and it\u2019s like Christmas morning. Was Twin Peaks: The Return a fulfilling experience for you? I loved every minute of it. [I had] the greatest cast and crew, and we had a great time going down the road together. If we\u2019d waited a few more years, it never would have happened. Because so many cast members [including Miguel Ferrer and Peggy Lipton] have died since you filmed it? Yes, and it\u2019s a terrible thing. I mean, I don\u2019t know how we human beings can \u2013 you just have someone that\u2019s a great friend, and you want to work with them, and suddenly they\u2019re gone. And you can\u2019t get them back. It\u2019s horrible. There were some colourful fan theories about Twin Peaks: The Return. Were you entertained by any of them? I don\u2019t know which ones you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t know anything. One theory proposed that if you play the last two episodes in tandem, hidden meanings are revealed. Bullshit. It\u2019s good to get your confirmation on that. But aren\u2019t you flattered when people seek out deeper meanings in your work? Sure. If there\u2019s 100 people in the audience, you\u2019re going to get 100 different interpretations, especially when things get abstract. It\u2019s beautiful. Everybody\u2019s a detective and whatever they come up with is valid in my mind. Jim Jarmusch recently said: \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just give David Lynch whatever money he needs? He needs money to make something; just give it to him!\u201d I love Jim. I never met him but I love his work. He\u2019s got a singular voice. And to come out and compliment another director, it takes a pretty big guy to do that. But money won\u2019t do any good if you don\u2019t have the ideas. In fact it can just add pressure. So if I had ideas, then the money would be beautiful. And the idea dictates whether it is a film, TV show or music video\u2026 Exactly. You can be a doctor, and you\u2019re getting ready to go to sleep, and you lay your head on the pillow and some idea flies in, and you\u2019re up the rest of your night writing this thing down. You\u2019ve got a cure for some disease or something \u2013 fantastic! Ideas are out there for everything.
