The animal faces down its would-be captors \u2013 armed with a net and long poles - and, without warning, knocks one of them to the ground with its powerful paws. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d another zookeeper asks the prone victim. But the scene, played out at a zoo in western Japan at the weekend, elicited smiles, not looks of horror, from bystanders capturing the drama on their mobile phones. The escaped animal \u2013 actually a member of staff in a lion costume \u2013 was the protagonist in the latest Japanese zoo safety drill that is as much entertainment as preparation for a genuine escape by a potentially dangerous predator. Zoos around the country regularly conduct similar drills, which invariably feature staff pursuing, then capturing, a chimpanzee, zebra or other \u201canimal\u201d with questionable acting skills. A Mainichi newspaper video of the lion drill has been widely shared online since it appeared on Saturday. One of the original posters, @johnny_suputama, drew his followers\u2019 attention to the expressions worn by Tobe Zoo\u2019s real lions, which appear deeply unimpressed as they watch the \u201clion\u201d being pursued by staff. The big cat\u2019s bid for freedom ends when it is subdued by a fake stun gun and covered in netting, before presumably being taken away for a change of clothes and a sit-down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
