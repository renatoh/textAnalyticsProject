Tonight is largely a showcase for his new album of cover versions of leftfield and alternative rock tracks, which, after a mere 50 years of making music, he has called Meet Glen Campbell. The exercise largely works because rather than approaching the songs with a Tom Jones-style ironic smirk, Campbell treats each one with old-school respect. Still trim and lean and dressed in black jeans, his innate sentimentality is perfectly suited to U2's mellifluous ballad All I Want Is You and John Lennon's mawkish pledge of devotion to Yoko, Grow Old With Me. Some schmaltzy numbers show why Campbell has long been a staple of the chicken-in-a-basket circuit, but he has always been a peerless interpreter of the melodramatic, piquant catalogue of Jimmy Webb, infusing Wichita Linesman with an ineffable sadness. It is a stretch to pour equal yearning into Green Day's snotty Good Riddance, but his attempt is heroic. Campbell closes a singular evening with his inevitable signature tune, Rhinestone Cowboy, and then returns to ease through Foo Fighters' brittle Times Like These and Velvet Underground's barbed opiate anthem, Jesus. Still beaming in the spotlight, his weathered face has gained an extra layer of twinkle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
