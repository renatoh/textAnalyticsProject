But why is Mark receiving electronic pornography, apparently from a girl named Giovana ? Unfortunately, that question is never satisfactorily answered in this otherwise involving novel. We do, however, discover, by way of infidelity and even some disturbingly blase paedophilia, that sound marriages can survive pretty much anything and that beneath the glossy lives of successful creative types all sorts of darkness lurks. The characters are so engaging that it is easy to forgive this book for occasionally taking itself too seriously, and to forget its author is Mrs Martin Amis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
