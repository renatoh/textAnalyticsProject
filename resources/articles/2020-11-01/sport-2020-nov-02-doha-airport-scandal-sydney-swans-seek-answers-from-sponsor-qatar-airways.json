The AFL club, who have held a sponsorship deal with the airline since 2016, said they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by reports last week that women, including a number of Australians, were strip-searched in early October after a newborn baby was found in the terminal. The incidents \u2013 which involved women on 10 flights, including 18 on planes bound for Sydney \u2013 caused international outrage and prompted the Qatari government to refer those responsible to the public prosecution office. \u201cWe were deeply concerned by the media reports last week involving the treatment of female passengers at Hamad International Airport in Doha,\u201d a Swans spokesperson told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe club has sought more information on the situation and that dialogue is continuing between our two organisations.\u201d The Swans and the state-owned airline, which also lists Fifa among its global partners, renewed the partnership when an original three-year deal expired last year. At the time, the Swans came under pressure from the club\u2019s strong LGBTQ+ community to walk away from signing a new agreement. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and the deal was labelled as \u201chypocrisy\u201d by the ABC commentator Corbin Middlemas, who came out as gay in 2018. The Swans have carved out a reputation as one of the AFL\u2019s more progressive clubs on social justice issues, and have contested the league\u2019s annual pride game \u2013 a celebration of LGBTQ+ inclusivity \u2013 since 2015. The Swans ambassador \u2013 and former New South Wales Labor MLC \u2013 Meredith Burgmann said the club also had a proven track record on fighting racism and had been successful in implementing an unofficial \u201cno dickheads\u201d cultural policy. \u201cI\u2019m sure the Swans leadership find it disturbing, but they will wait to see what happens with the inquiry,\u201d Burgmann said. \u201cThe Swans have always been good on these issues.\u201d As part of the ongoing deal with Sydney, Qatar Airways receives prominent branding at Swans home games and their training ground, while players are involved in marketing and promotional activities. The Swans\u2019 official supporters group said it was taking the airport incidents \u201cvery seriously\u201d and also confirmed it was seeking answers from the airline. Golf Australia, which also lists the airline as a major corporate partner, has been contacted for comment by Guardian Australia. The political fallout of the compulsory medical examinations in Doha has already been felt, with Australian politicians from the major parties pulling out of a formal dinner at the Qatari ambassador\u2019s residence in protest. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, said the incidents were \u201cappalling\u201d, while the Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz Al Thani, said the women\u2019s treatment had been \u201cunacceptable\u201d. On the announcement of the partnership four years ago, the Qatar Airways chief executive, Akbar Al Baker, said: \u201cWe strongly believe in connecting with our global travellers through their passion for sport, and have been looking for the right partner for Qatar Airways in Australia\u2019s sports arena.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
