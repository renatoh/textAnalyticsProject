Image of the week A new wave of indigenous art is heading for Britain, starting with Native American artists that are attempting to \u201creverse colonialism\u201d in a show at Birmingham\u2019s Ikon.

Uccello delights in rounded armour and lances, the curving solids of horses and helmets, and standards fluttering in deep space. But his understanding of the new science of perspective, which was theorised in early 15th-century Florence by Leon Battista Alberti, is incomplete. The hill in the background rears up like a flat tapestry, instead of receding to a vanishing point. This experimental quality makes Uccello\u2019s martial masterpiece resemble early 20th-century cubist and futurist art. \u2022National Gallery, London Don\u2019t forget To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.
