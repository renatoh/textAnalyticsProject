At the close they were 403-7 with Hodnett still there, having batted almost the whole day. Gidman reached his century first with one of the numerous fours to the empty reaches of third man. Cricket's wanton disregard for placing a fielder there has become a ritual of almost criminal neglect. Here, as these days is so often the case, the boundaries mounted without even a semblance of revised thought against the prolonged trend. With Gidman the faster and more purposeful the pair added 199 in a fourth-wicket stand which was the highest for Gloucestershire against Derbyshire. Their afternoon session in particular seemed at times leisurely against persevering if nondescript bowling. The more elegant Gidman, with plenty of clean strokes, hit 15 fours and a six in 134 balls. Hodnett's more painstaking persona had its own virtues - and one slice of luck. He should have been taken at gully when he had scored nine. But he had a valued aura of patience as he went steadily on. The day had started well for Gloucestershire with Craig Spearman parading eight fours in his half-century before chasing a wide ball for the convenience of gully. Kevin Dean had Hamish Marshall, and Hodnett, dropped. There was not enough animation in the track for the faster bowlers or enough movement for the spinners. By early evening, Greg Smith had given up his off-breaks for seam, though he returned to spin before the close. For the second day at this rescheduled fixture there was a modestly decent crowd, if hardly what the county would have expected at Cheltenham. There was a discernible hybrid atmosphere round the ground with Cheltenham voices well in evidence after hastily rearranged holiday plans. Historically, it might be argued, the north and south cricket fans in Gloucestershire have not always been the most congenial of bedfellows. \"I've had my deckchair here for years and now some bloke from up there has taken my space,\" one heard on the long-on boundary. Cricket can be amusingly petty as well as territorial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
