The industry has no shame", "bodyText": "One thing I learned about the taxi industry, after 15 years driving cabs, is that it\u2019s burdened neither by self-awareness nor shame. Take, for example, the Taxi Council of Queensland\u2019s claim that the ride-share service Uber is a potential haven for sexual predators the taxi industry rejects. Pardon? My observation is that it\u2019s next to impossible to get rejected by the taxi industry, at least in my home state of Queensland. Drivers are like gold; keeping bums behind the wheel is all that counts as the cab cartel \u2013 once as convinced as Kodak that the digital thing would never catch on \u2013 faces up to its own mortality. It\u2019s not as if the mainstream industry doesn\u2019t have its own safety issues. Just punch \u201ctaxi sexual assault\u201d into any search engine. In Victoria the Institute of Forensic Medicine identified 25 cases over a three-year period. Most of the victims were heavily intoxicated. Two were intellectually disabled. I have lost count of the number of my female friends who won\u2019t have anything to do with taxis after being scared off by drivers who suggested there might be other ways of paying their fare, or who loitered around their front doors with intent, or who upbraided them for being out alone without their husbands. But the industry is behaving like a spurned lover in need of an intervention order with its unlawful/unsafe/uninsured campaigns against ride sharing. Yes Uber has a multitude of issues, but what cabbies really can\u2019t cope with is that the public doesn\u2019t believe a damn thing they say anymore. Not surprisingly, they\u2019re voting with their wallets \u2013 not that they need carry them in Uber\u2019s cashless transaction model. It\u2019s an obvious winner for safety-conscious drivers, too, who would quite happily do their jobs without collecting cash, which makes them sitting ducks for passengers with a penchant for violence and a desire for easy money. Two weeks before I gave away the game for good, I read a scathing piece by Wendy Squires giving the one-finger salute to taxis. I checked off each of her points, one by one \u2013 all the ways the industry had treated her, both as a customer and as a woman, like shit on a shoe. That article should be pinned prominently in every head office of every cab company in Australia and beyond, as a laundry list of what the industry needs to change if it\u2019s to step up to the plate of good customer service in the 21st century. It won\u2019t be, because the industry won\u2019t admit it has a problem. And because change is all too hard. For me, the writing has been on the wall for months. The signs were bad even before Christmas but, after the traditionally slow January, business never quite recovered. The return of university students in late February saw little improvement, and by the time exams rolled around, I was struggling to take home $100 from a 12-hour night shift. Seriously, why would any self-respecting student with a smartphone want to take a taxi today? Young people have adopted the new technology (as young people will) because they know a better product when they see it, and they know when they\u2019re getting stiffed. The only friends the taxi industry has left are the state governments that \u2013 after handing out the licences valued more like mortgages \u2013 have tried and mostly failed to protect their monopolies, and the businesses that hand out Cabcharge dockets to their employees. Ah yes, Cabcharge, the racket that still gouges you 10% in Queensland (it\u2019s been lowered to 5% in Victoria and New South Wales) for the privilege of using your credit or debit card every time you pay up. They got a \u201cShonky\u201d award from Consumer magazine Choice for that one back in 2012. That\u2019s 10% of the saving a consumer like Squires makes every time she decides to catch an Uber, bugger whatever the industry says about safety. As she rightly calculates, she has the driver\u2019s name, photo ID, car model, registration, rating and phone number. Most sane people would regard that as a safer option than falling into a cab, dead drunk, in the middle of the night and trying to remember the number of the vehicle. Cameras aren\u2019t a great deal of assistance if you have little recollection of what\u2019s happened to you, much less who took you home. They can be disabled easily anyway. The cab industry is also a victim of its own business model. Like Uber, its drivers are not considered employees \u2013 despite wearing a uniform, driving marked cars and signing up to loosely enforced company policies \u2013 but independent contractors, paid a percentage of each fare. The cab industry is mostly populated by cowboys and Indians. The cowboys own the vast majority of the licences and have the ears of the relevant ministers. The Indians mostly just drive. There are no retainers for the excruciating hours worked; no benefits like sick pay or annual leave. It is, frankly, an industry built on exploitation: a workforce poorly trained and badly remunerated, governed by a body with no will to clean up its act and no disincentive to cut corners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
