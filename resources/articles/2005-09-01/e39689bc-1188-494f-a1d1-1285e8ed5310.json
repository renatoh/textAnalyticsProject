After observing a moment's silence on the White House lawn for the victims of the 2001 attacks, Mr Bush left for New Orleans, where he was immediately helicoptered aboard a naval assault ship, the USS Iwo Jima, docked in the city centre. He is due to venture forth into the streets today in a military Humvee to inspect the damage and the reconstruction, before flying on to Mississippi. Yesterday - proclaimed as Patriot Day - provided a bridge between two disasters which could ultimately define the Bush presidency. Mr Bush sought to recall the nation's fighting spirit immediately after 9/11, the peak of his popularity, as an antidote to the apparent confusion and bungling that characterised his administration's reaction to Katrina. His third visit to the region in 10 days coincided with some rare good news. The army said it was pumping the floodwater out of New Orleans faster than expected and should be finished by next month. The first sweeps of abandoned neighbourhoods uncovered few bodies, suggesting that initial fears of up to 10,000 dead may have been exaggerated. Among the living, the mood was still sour yesterday. At a makeshift refugee camp in a Baton Rouge civic centre, there was little sign that anyone was drawing the same September 11 parallels as the president. None of the 2,000 evacuees even paused to mark the moment, at 8.46am, when the first plane crashed into the World Trade Centre. Alice Tobias, 32, said: \"Right now this feels pretty much like a war zone. But it's kind of hard to think about 9/11 when we are going through our own destruction. They knew it [Katrina] was coming, everybody from the mayor to the president, but they did nothing.\" A Newsweek survey found that only 38% of Americans think Mr Bush is doing a good job, his lowest rating since he took office in 2001, while 53% said they no longer trusted him to make the right decision in a foreign or domestic crisis. With Democrats calling for an independent commission of inquiry, the postmortems published in yesterday's US press found that red tape and lack of leadership paralysed the federal authorities in the critical first days of the hurricane and the New Orleans flood. Newsweek magazine's cover described the debacle as a \"national shame\". The headline on the front of Time read \"System failure\". Mr Bush was portrayed as being isolated in a \"bubble\" of loyal yes-men. After the hurricane hit on August 29, according to Time, it took Louisiana's panicked governor, Kathleen Blanco, hours to reach the president, who was holding a jokey photo-opportunity with Senator John McCain in Arizona and attending a country club roundtable to drum up support for his healthcare policy. Administration officials yesterday promised a White House address to the nation, appealing for the spirit of unity that prevailed after the hijackers struck and echoing some of the rhetoric that helped to galvanise Americans four years ago. The administration plans a reconstruction effort costing at least $200bn (\u00a3110m) under a \"tsar\" - perhaps Colin Powell, Rudy Giuliani or a similarly unifying national figure. A development corporation similar to the one overseeing the post-9/11 reconstruction of Lower Manhattan is also being considered. In the short term, however, well connected lobbyists appear to be in the driving seat. Joe Allbaugh, the former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and now a private consultant, is helping to win contracts for clients such as Halliburton (Vice-President Dick Cheney's former company), which has a $500m contract for repairs, and the Baton Rouge-based Shaw Group. About 100 Britons remain unaccounted for, according to the Foreign Office. \u00b7 The US is bracing itself for Hurricane Ophelia, which meteorologists predicted would bring 80mph winds to the southern tip of the Carolinas by tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
