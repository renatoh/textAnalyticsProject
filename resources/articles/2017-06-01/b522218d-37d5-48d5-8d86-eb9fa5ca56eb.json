Broadcasters and broadcasting, particularly in these days of social media, face an even more fleeting passage through the public consciousness. That Steve Hewlett, the former broadcaster and Guardian columnist, is bucking this trend is an indication of the nature of the man and his impact on his colleagues and the British public. Tonight (Monday 12 June) friends and former colleagues will join forces with the Royal Television Society and The Media Society to launch a series of Steve Hewlett scholarships designed to support young people across the country from low-income families to pursue a career in journalism. Steve died earlier this year after the bravest and most public of encounters with inoperable cancer of the oesophagus, with which he was diagnosed in March 2016. Most people given a hammer blow diagnosis of terminal cancer understandably tend to set their affairs in order and quietly prepare for the inevitable. That was never possible for Steve. He was too obsessive about his job of discovering the truth and telling it how it is. He could not never let a story stay untold, even when for the first time in his life he was very personally at the very heart of it. So he embarked on his remarkable series of interviews with Eddie Mair on Radio 4\u2019s PM show, reinforced with his regular dispatches in the Observer charting his battle with and experiences of cancer. He was a natural and inspirational story teller and, as listeners, we just had to tune in to hear the latest milestone in Steve\u2019s journey even though we were all too tragically aware of its eventual outcome. Those interviews and columns crowned a career, but we should never forget the brilliance of his previous work: the scoops for the Media Show, which he presented from 2008 until his death; the groundbreaking interview with Princess Diana when he was editor of Panorama, the award-winning shows he commissioned or edited when he was at Channel 4, ITV and the BBC. Rumpled, portly, funny, occasionally chippy, irrepressible, endless knowledgeable, loyal, wise, generous and a very proud dad: Steve was a great man to work with and an even more delightful man to go to the pub with. Each scholarship will be worth \u00a32,000 a year and will be offered to a young man or woman studying journalism as part of a recognised British university course and comes with paid up membership of the RTS. The appeal will be launched on 12 June by Steve\u2019s sons Freddie, Billy and Bertie on PM in an interview with Eddie Mair. \u201cWe are so proud to launch this scholarship in Dad\u2019s name. He knew about it and was involved in the very early planning of the scholarship before he died. It was so important to him,\u201d they said. \u201cWe hope that it will inspire, encourage and support young people across the country from lower income families to pursue a career in journalism. To bring the issues that they hold dear to the fore, to not give up on what they believe and, as Dad said, \u2018stay inquisitive\u2019.\u201d The scholarship will be funded on a long term basis as part of the RTS\u2019 annual Undergraduate Bursary scheme, and RTS along with the Media Society are leading a major fund-raising appeal to grow the bursary pot. The first annual memorial Steve Hewlett lecture will be given by his friend Nick Robinson of the Today Programme in central London in September. Organisations already backing the initiative include: BBC Radio Four, Brunel University, Channel 4, Google UK, ITN, ITV, Sky News, The London Press Club, Women in Journalism; and individuals including: Trevor Phillips OBE, Roger Bolton, Peter Taylor OBE, Scott Trust chairman Alex Graham, and Fiona Chesterton.
