The prison service last night refused to name the super-efficient animal but said there had been \"tangible death threats against the dog because it is so successful\". It is among the three labradors, two spaniels and a collie used at the former Strangeways prison to search visitors for drugs. In a report on the jail by the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, published today, she says that staff, prisoners and visitors had complained that one dog was \"clearly not operating in line with the others at the prison\". It was taken off frontline duties so that its powers could be tested. \"He was 100% more sensitive than some drug dogs and he was also 100% more accurate,\" said a prison spokeswoman. \"He is now back in commission helping to reduce the drug supplies into Manchester through social visits.\" The use of sniffer dogs is resented because they often sniff lines of visitors in full view of everyone. But the prison service maintains that they have proved their worth at Manchester. The proportion of inmates testing positive for illicit drugs was 30% in the 12 months to this April, but stands at 13% so far this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
