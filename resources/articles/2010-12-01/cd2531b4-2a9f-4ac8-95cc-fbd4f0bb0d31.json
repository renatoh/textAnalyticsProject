The presidents of Sierra Leone, Benin and Cape Verde held three hours of talks with Gbagbo at the presidential palace in Abidjan after first meeting with the top UN envoy to the country. As the meeting ended, Benin's president, Boni Yayi, said simply: \"All went well.\" The three leaders declined to comment further. Earlier there were ominous signs for the delegation when Gbagbo's supporters said he would use the meeting to put across his side of the story. Government spokesman Ahoua Don Melo told the BBC: \"Let's avoid political delinquency. No international institution has the right to intervene by force to impose a president in a sovereign state.\" There had been hopes that Gbagbo's three west African neighbours would succeed where the UN, US, EU and African Union have failed in convincing him to accept defeat in last month's presidential election against Alassane Ouattara. They were to offer him the chance of going into exile. \"We are leaving today and returning today after discussions with Laurent Gbagbo of the Ivory Coast and we are sure of getting positive results,\" Sierra Leone's information and communication minister, Ibrahim Ben Kargbo, said earlier. \"It is just possible we are talking about military intervention but let's hope it does not come to that.\" However, Gbagbo was not about to quit. A spokesman for the government said it would sever ties with countries that recognised envoys named by Ouattara only a matter of hours after the meeting with Ivory Coast's neighbouring leaders. \"The government would like to make it known that in the light of such decisions, it reserves the right to apply reciprocity in ending the missions of their ambassadors in Ivory Coast,\" he said in a statement on national television on Tuesday. The French foreign minister, Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie, had said that France would accredit a new Ivorian ambassador at the request of Ouattara's government, which it recognises as the winner of last month's contested election. UN helicopters were due to fly the delegation to the Golf hotel to meet Ouattara, who is under UN protection there. The UN peacekeepers are themselves encircled by troops loyal to Gbagbo. The 15-nation, west African regional bloc, Ecowas, has threatened to use \"legitimate force\" if Gbagbo does not relinquish his 10-year grip on power. Nigeria has the strongest army in the region and would be expected to play a key role if an operation is launched. Ouattara's camp has been confident in recent days that such help is coming. \"It's not a bluff,\" said one senior adviser. \"The soldiers are coming much faster than anyone thinks.\" Ecowas has intervened in past disputes, including the 1998 seizure of Sierra Leone's capital that forced military leaders to flee and allowed an elected president to return to power. It also took action in Liberia in 1990 and its forces stayed for several years, and it sent troops to Guinea-Bissau. But some analysts believe an Ecowas mission in Ivory Coast would entail a full-scale invasion, causing many civilian casualties. After several days of calm, sporadic gunfire was heard today in the Abidjan neighbourhood of Abobo, a stronghold of Ouattara supporters. A Reuters witness said police were chasing youths trying to set up barricades of burning tyres. It was not known if there were any casualties. Pro-Gbagbo youths attacked a UN patrol in the Abidjan suburb of Yopougon. They wrecked one car and seriously injured one UN peacekeeper. He was taken to the UN's headquarters by police. Weeks of post-election violence may have left 200 people dead, according to the US. Human rights groups blame security forces associated with Gbagbo for hundreds of arrests and dozens of cases of torture and disappearances. The UN has said it was unable to investigate reports of a mass grave because of restrictions on the movement of UN personnel. Meanwhile the UN under-secretary general for peacekeeping operations, Alain Le Roy, was prevented from passing a road block near the Golf hotel and had to travel by helicopter. A planned mass rally tomorrow by the powerful, pro-Gbagbo Young Patriot movement was suspended to allow for negotiations. Its leader, Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, who is also Gbagbo's youth minister, said: \"I think the current situation benefits no one. Let's allow for diplomacy to run its course. That's why I'm going to cancel the rally at Place de la R\u00e9publique.\" Since Ouattara called for a general strike, buses have stopped working in Abidjan, leaving thousands stranded at home. He draws support from transport unions. Provisional election results in the world's biggest cocoa grower showed Ouattara winning by eight percentage points, but the nation's top court, run by a Gbagbo ally, overturned the results. Gbagbo has been in power since 2000 and had already overstayed his mandate by five years when the long-delayed presidential election was finally held in October. The runoff took place in November. The election was intended to help reunify a country that has been divided by the civil war into a rebel-controlled north and a loyalist south. Ecowas is comprised of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
