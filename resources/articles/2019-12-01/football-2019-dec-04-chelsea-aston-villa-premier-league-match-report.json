Chelsea\u2019s supporters wanted to show their appreciation for their former captain and they could afford to be generous with their applause after watching their young side ensure that Aston Villa\u2019s first-team coach did not enjoy his big homecoming too much, earning three vital points thanks to excellent goals from Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount. It had been a good fight. Villa were pressing for an unlikely equaliser in the closing stages, almost snatching an undeserved point when Kepa Arrizabalaga kept out a late header from Douglas Luiz, and Chelsea endured some tense moments as they protected their 2-1 lead. Frank Lampard\u2019s side also escaped when Ahmed Elmohamady volleyed over from 12 yards. All the same this was a fine victory for Chelsea after their aberration against West Ham last weekend. Lampard\u2019s academy products were eager to put on a show once the pre-match tributes for Terry were done and they hogged the limelight in the end. Abraham scored his 11th Premier League goal of the season, Reece James picked up another assist and Mount was back to his enterprising best in midfield, running the game in the second half and settling the contest with a superb finish in the 48th minute. Mount showed wonderful technique to volley past Tom Heaton after being set up by Abraham and the 20-year-old midfielder\u2019s first goal since 6 October allowed Chelsea to regain their poise after gifting Villa a soft equaliser four minutes before the interval. \u201cIt should have been more comfortable before the end,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cWe need to be more clinical but it was the team I want to see. Against West Ham it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Chelsea, who are six points above fifth-placed Wolves, did not let the nostalgia spilling from the stands blur their focus. They had to ignore the fuss over Terry\u2019s return to Stamford Bridge and they were full of eager intensity eager after failing to commit a single foul against West Ham, taking their cue from N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s relentless energy in midfield. \u201cThey were good,\u201d Dean Smith, Villa\u2019s manager, said. \u201cI thought there were three Kant\u00e9s on the pitch.\u201d Villa, a point above the bottom three, struggled to live with Chelsea\u2019s speed. There were ominous signs as early as the fifth minute, when Christian Pulisic charged unopposed through the middle before teeing up Willian to sting Heaton\u2019s palms, and the opening goal arrived when a lovely cross from James, a 19-year-old right-back with a wicked delivery, found Abraham unmarked in the area. Chelsea were far more dangerous with Abraham available after missing the West Ham game with a hip injury and the striker, who scored 26 goals during his loan spell at Villa last season, headed past Heaton after peeling away from Ezri Konsa. \u201cOf course if a player\u2019s on such a good run and they come out of the team it\u2019s normal that you miss them,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cToday he came straight back in as he left off.\u201d Yet frailties lingered at the other end. Chelsea\u2019s defence lacks a leader in the Terry mould and Villa levelled out of nothing. Elmohamady crossed from the right and James showed his inexperience at the far post, failing to track Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet\u2019s run and allowing the Egyptian to bundle a messy finish past Arrizabalaga. It was naive defending from James but Chelsea demonstrated the benefits of youthful exuberance early in the second half. Abraham\u2019s clever chest control from Willian\u2019s chip gave Mount the chance to adjust his body and slash a beautiful volley high to Heaton\u2019s left. That lowered the tension. Willian then tested Heaton twice, first with a firm drive, then with a free-kick that the Villa goalkeeper tipped on to the woodwork. Mount also went close from 25 yards and Abraham, who hobbled off near the end, ran through before dinking wide. Smith knew Villa did not deserve anything, though he was frustrated that the officials did not deal with Jack Grealish\u2019s rough treatment by Chelsea. \u201cThere\u2019s been a tag team at times fouling Jack Grealish,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were five or six today, there was a foul on the edge of the box that wasn\u2019t given. I\u2019d like to see a lot better officiating. If he doesn\u2019t get protection, then yes you worry for him.\u201d It was feisty at times but the mood was light after the final whistle. Terry was on for his ovation and he had seen a glimpse of the future from Chelsea\u2019s youngsters. The greatest captain in Chelsea\u2019s history won so much alongside Lampard, who used to time those runs from midfield to perfection, and he must have felt a stab of nostalgia watching Mount burst forward to settle this contest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
