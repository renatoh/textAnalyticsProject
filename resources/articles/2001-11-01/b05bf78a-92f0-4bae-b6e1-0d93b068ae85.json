The England international is understood to be furious at the way Newcastle have handled the affair. Dyer, along with Carl Cort, Craig Bellamy and Andy Griffin, was sent home on Tuesday after missing a dinner in honour of the club's Marbella-based president and former chairman Sir John Hall on Monday night. It was claimed that the four players spent the day drinking in bars near the La Quenta resort. One newspaper yesterday quoted a club \"insider\" as saying that the four \"ended up really drunk\" and became involved in \"a huge melee\" after an argument with a local man. The club issued a statement saying the four \"have been fined\", an allegation that Barnett denies. \"They were never involved in a brawl, they were never involved in anything to do with drunkenness and they have not been fined,\" he said. \"Kieron has been hung out to dry - absolutely.\" It is understood that despite several escapades involving alcohol and females - the manager Bobby Robson said he once \"court-martialled\" the player - Dyer has never been fined since joining Newcastle from Ipswich Town for \u00a36m two years ago. This may be because the club are anxious not to annoy a player coveted by most of the nation's leading clubs. They may have done so now - Dyer was described as \"furious\" yesterday by a club colleague. The players, who have all apologised, believe that the incident has been blown out of proportion and should have been kept private, insisting it was no more than an innocent mistake. \"We were not aware that the dinner we missed was for Sir John Hall,\" Griffin said yesterday. And Bellamy insisted: \"It was a night out, and that's all it was. There wasn't any trouble.\" The Newcastle party return tonight and report for training tomorrow morning. Robson can expect a confrontation with Dyer but also with other disaffected British players. They are disappointed that Newcastle's foreign players were allowed home to visit their families whereas they themselves were forced to go to Spain. The Ecuador striker Agustin Delgado is to undergo a further knee scan before finalising a move to Southampton, after ignoring the advice of club doctors and playing for his country this week when they qualified for the World Cup for the first time. Leicester are still hoping to bring the Chinese international Zhang Yuning to Filbert Street on loan until the end of the season, despite scepticism from the Home Office, which believes the Liaoning Fushun striker does not meet work-permit criteria. The Chinese FA has since intervened to push its player's claims. Crystal Palace's reserve-team coach Mark Bowen, appointed by Steve Bruce in the summer, has said that he would like to join Bruce in leaving the club. Andy Ritchie, who was sacked by Oldham last week, is in line for a swift return to management with Third Division Rochdale should Steve Parkin, as expected, move to Barnsley in the next few days. Macclesfield have appointed the former Manchester City assistant David Moss as their manager until the end of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
