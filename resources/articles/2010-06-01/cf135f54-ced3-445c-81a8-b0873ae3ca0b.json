When you run out of rabbits to toss, it takes your arm. A similar sense of the unpredictable attends a frank exchange with Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister. Will he be amused by the effrontery of a critical question, and will the questioner emerge with all his limbs attached? Reality TV does not come more real than that. Yuri Shevchuk, a rock star and Kremlin critic, had been specifically told not to ask sharp questions before a televised meeting between the prime minister and the participants of a charity concert in St Petersburg. So he chanced his arm. \"Do you have a plan for the serious, sincere and honest liberalisation and democratisation of our country so state organisations do not strangle us and so we stop being afraid of the police on the streets?\" the rock star asked innocently. Mr Putin replied that he welcomed protests. They did not hinder, but helped his government. The verbal jousting continued. When Mr Shevchuk suggested the prime minister use his political weight to solve problems, Mr Putin parried that he only weighed 76 kilograms. To be fair, Mr Putin gave as good as he got, and published the whole exchange in Russian and English on his website. But if anyone thought things would change in Russia as a result of this mild banter, they were to be sorely disabused. Two days later police rounded up hundreds of protesters in Moscow, detaining 180 of them. They were, of course, helping the government with their inquiries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
