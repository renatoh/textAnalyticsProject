San Diego\u2019s police department announced on Monday it had released Anthony Alexander Padgett, 36, who was detained last Friday in connection to a grisly spree of stabbings and burnings that killed three men and wounded another. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough evidence to keep him behind bars right now,\u201d Capt Dave Nisleit told a news conference. \u201cWe have discovered exculpatory evidence.\u201d Nisleit said police had arrested Padgett, who is homeless, because he resembled a suspect in a surveillance video and had been convicted in 2010 of setting fire to a fellow transient. He was due to be arraigned on Monday charged with murder and attempted murder but police decided against filing charges, the captain said. \u201cI can\u2019t with good confidence move forward with keeping Padgett in custody.\u201d However, Nisleit declined to say Padgett, who is from Chula Vista, was in the clear, or whether police were tailing him. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I have the wrong guy.\u201d He said police still believed the suspect in the surveillance video was the killer \u2013 and that police could re-arrest Padgett if new evidence came to light. The police department issued a new plea for information. \u201cWe need the public\u2019s assistance to provide additional tips and leads to help us solve these crimes.\u201d Padgett\u2019s release renewed fear among San Diego\u2019s sizable homeless community, said Michael McConnell, a homeless advocate. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to convict someone who has not received a trial but we certainly won\u2019t feel safe with him being out. They arrested him for a reason.\u201d The release raised embarrassing questions for authorities about last week\u2019s manhunt, the biggest in recent memory. Padgett was convicted of assault and mayhem for setting fire to a man in National City, near Chula Vista, in 2010. Last week\u2019s homicidal spree left three men dead. Dionicio Derek Vahidy, 23, died on Sunday in a hospital four days after being doused with flammable liquid and set on fire while he was sleeping. The attacks began on 2 July when the body of Angelo de Nardo, 53, was found on fire between a local freeway and train tracks. He suffered extensive trauma to his upper torso and died before his body was set alight. The next day another homeless man, Manuel Mason, 61, suffered severe injuries to his torso. He is in critical condition. A short while later the same day police found the bloodied body of another homeless man, Shawn Longley, 41. Homeless people interviewed downtown said assaults were a fact of life on the streets and left them feeling like \u201csitting ducks\u201d. Last month someone bludgeoned half a dozen homeless people in a single night, a spree believed to be unrelated to last week\u2019s murders. The homicides have shone a harsh light on a city that markets itself as a business-friendly tourist mecca. Once considered a backwater to Los Angeles, San Diego has acquired a hip reputation for sleek condos, technological innovation, gastronomy, arts and mega-events, notably Comic-Con, the annual pop culture jamboree, which starts on 21 July. Last year 34.2 million visitors spent a record $9.9bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
