She had initially been told by 111 call responders to nurse her symptoms at home, but was instructed to go to hospital after coughing up blood. On her third day in hospital \u2013 her 13th with the illness \u2013 Ati started bringing up more blood and felt an ever greater tightness in her chest as her temperature rose further. That night it started to fall. \u201cTo my surprise, it did not come back,\u201d she recalls of the fever. \u201cMy body finally began to fight it off and the next day they told me I could go home the day after if everything stayed stable. \u201cI was so relieved. I had kept thinking I should\u2019ve been admitted earlier and feared it was too late. It was the most terrifying experience of my life.\u201d More than 29,000 people across the UK are confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, and it is thought that thousands more have it. The disease has killed 2,352 people in the UK so far. Meanwhile, 174,019 people globally are known to have recovered. The number in the UK remains unclear, but heartening reports are beginning to emerge. \u201cI actually got out of bed today, which is huge,\u201d says 51-year-old Lou, in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire. \u201cI thought I was dying Wednesday last week, when I couldn\u2019t take a breath and was losing consciousness.\u201d Paramedics who came to Lou\u2019s house found that her temperature exceeded 40C (104F) and her blood pressure and oxygen intake had dropped. She was rushed to hospital along with her husband, who was also symptomatic. She was tested for Covid-19 on Friday and is still awaiting her results. In hospital she was put on a drip and given a variety of drugs, and her condition stabilised. She was discharged several days later as the choking feeling began to ease and her fever subsided. \u201cIt makes you think: sod bloody work. When this is over, we are having fun,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s baby steps, but we are slowly getting there.\u201d Only patients with the worst symptoms are being admitted to hospital, and 22-year-old Ryan is among many whom 111 call handlers have told to stay at home and self-isolate unless they have severe difficulties breathing. \u201cI\u2019m very relieved I recovered,\u201d says Ryan, a third-year engineering student at Imperial College London, telling of coughing red phlegm, exhaustion, night sweats and nausea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get out of bed when the fever was at its worst. I lost my appetite and could barely drink water.\u201d He says he is usually healthy and that the ordeal has been a big shock. Now he just wants to return to his home country, Malaysia. Jenny, 59, a former GP in Falkirk who has multiple sclerosis, isolated herself from her vulnerable family and has since been able to resume normal life. \u201cI\u2019m a week down the line from two weeks\u2019 self-isolation in a van on my driveway,\u201d she says. \u201cI have never experienced anything like it. I\u2019m 99.5% certain I had Covid. It felt like I had a tight band going through my diaphragm.\u201d Although she is still quite fatigued and has to stop to catch her breath while walking through her village, she has now returned to caring for her partner, who is undergoing chemotherapy, and her father, who has dementia. Jenny stresses her desire to give people optimism about recovery and the importance of isolating if you have symptoms. \u201cEvery single one of us can make a difference in the flattening of the epidemic curve,\u201d she says. For Ati, the episode has given her a new sense of community. \u201cWe started to see messages from neighbours, my GP and friends offering help,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so comforting to see how society comes together.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
