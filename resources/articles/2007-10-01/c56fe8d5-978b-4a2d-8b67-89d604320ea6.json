Even near the end of his life this former pillar of the 1960s underground press, and then critic, youth worker and inspirational figure in the charity world, was still jotting down ideas for what he called the Great Willesden Novel. The north-west London suburb would be peopled with families quarrelling in Yiddish, communists, Zionists and bright-eyed boys who read Dante, Marx and Heidegger in the sixth form of Kilburn grammar school. This is the kind of place Robins grew up in, not genteel or proletarian, but gritty. His father, a barber, had been an amateur boxer. His mother was a communist with a soft spot for Stalin, at least until Soviet anti-semitism became too apparent to ignore. This background gave her son an encyclopaedic knowledge of political ideology and boxing lore. Inspired by an extraordinary history teacher, Dr Walter Isaacson, he was also steeped in literature and philosophy as a schoolboy. Robins received a grant to study English at University College London in 1964. It was a liberation, from family and Willesden. He soon became entangled in a very different world. After a chance meeting at the Indica bookshop in Mayfair with Barry Miles, a legendary 1960s figure, he became an editor at the underground paper IT. Never a Beatles fan, let alone a hippy, he had a style more akin to that of a 1950s beatnik: jazz, poetry and radical politics were more his line than incense or flower power. He exuded a thrillingly working-class air to his mostly bourgeois peers in the world of underground papers, and sometimes played this up to his advantage. He took part in the 1968 student rebellion in Paris, returning to London full of enthusiasm for the situationists, whose ideas about transforming life through spectacle and art appealed to him. Later, he was involved with the squatters' movement in Amsterdam. Spectacle was as important to Robins as poetry and politics. After a two-year break among the hippies, Black Panthers and anarchists in the US, and a stint of university teaching in Canada, he returned to London, where he contributed articles about Brecht and political theatre to various journals, including Plays and Players. In the late 1970s, he wrote history dramas for the BBC. But this was after a time of drifting that could have turned him into another burnt-out 1960s casualty. As he observed: \"The libertarian loony left scene of the early 70s was very strong on rogering and leg-over: it was a leg-over based scene. The centrality of leg-over.\" Robins did his share of leg-over, dope, not bothering to get out of bed, and so forth. But unlike most libertarian dreamers, he developed a serious interest in working-class youth, and was concerned that they were developing movements of their own, to his mind often in the wrong directions: the National Front and the like. This is where Robins really came into his own. His interest in sociology, politics and literature came together with a tough-minded compassion for troubled young people, whose sense of deprivation was often expressed in violence. He wrote several important books on disaffected youth: Knuckle Sandwich: Growing Up in the Working Class City (with Philip Cohen, 1978); We Hate Humans (1984); and Tarnished Vision: Crime and Conflict in the Inner City (1993). With Dick Pountain, he wrote the widely acclaimed Cool Rules (2000). He also actively tried to help, by working for some unexpected institutions. In the 1980s, he joined the Prince's Trust to design training projects for unemployed youth. In 1993, he became director of grants at John Lyon's Charity, where he dispensed money from Harrow school to youth organisations in London. An early death is always cruel, but especially so in the case of a good and brilliant man, who still had so much left to do. He is survived by his wife, the art historian Anna Gruetzner Robins, and his children, Daniel and Sophie. Dick Pountain writes: David Robins and I met during the most turbulent days of the 1960s counterculture - around the Paris May events of 1968 and the London Street Commune at 144 Piccadilly of autumn 1969. In 1970, we worked together on the underground paper Ink during its chaotic, cooperatively edited libertarian period. When that ferment fizzled out, we followed different paths, he into youth sociology research, I into computer journalism. Later, with families and proper jobs, we stayed in touch. Then in 1998, over a pint and a Grouse, we remarked that our children seemed to be reviving - unprompted, if not actively discouraged - many of the attitudes of the 1960s. In particular they had started to call things \"cool\" again, and we wondered how their criterion differed from ours. Such ponderings turned into our collaborative book, Cool Rules. Our tastes in music and literature meshed smoothly enough, but it was entirely thanks to David that Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan received their due. David never lost his urge to understand the way society works and to make a difference in it. \u00b7 David Nathan Robins, writer and sociologist, born November 17 1944; died October 6 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
