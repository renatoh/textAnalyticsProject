Ramos could even take charge for Sunday's fixture against Manchester United. Ramos met with the Tottenham club secretary John Alexander and vice-chairman Paul Kemsley at the Alfonso XIII hotel in Seville last Friday. And although both parties tried to downplay the significance of the meeting, claiming that it was entirely coincidental, Martin Jol's position at Tottenham has become untenable. Ramos is keen to move to White Hart Lane having been assured by Spurs that there will be no problems terminating Jol's contract. The Spaniard is now waiting for a formal offer from Tottenham to confirm the basis of the deal presented to him during Friday's meeting. Jol's relationship with the board and with the sporting director, Damien Comolli, has deteriorated. Some reports suggest that he recently asked his chairman, Daniel Levy, to sell Dimitar Berbatov after the Bulgarian reacted angrily to being substituted against Sunderland on the season's opening day, only for his employer to side with the player. Spurs now believe that the Dutchman has taken the side as far as he can and that they need a new coach to challenge for a top-four finish. Spurs have had a longstanding interest in Ramos, and they are now keen to have him in place before this weekend's match. Ramos has never hidden his desire to coach in the Premiership and was close to a move to Manchester City in the summer. He wants to leave the Sanchez Pizju\u00e1n, where he feels he can no longer work with the president Jose Maria del Nido. He is also aware that Sevilla's astonishing recent success may not be sustainable - something that has been underlined by the almost certain departure of their star player, Daniel Alves. Having won the Spanish Super Cup, defeating Real Madrid 5-3 at the Bernab\u00e9u on Sunday, Ramos believes he will leave Sevilla on a high. He is keen not to start the Spanish league season, which begins against Getafe on Saturday, because he does not want to depart as a villain who left his club in the lurch. Both Tottenham and Ramos may have to brace themselves for a fight, however. Although Ramos has resisted attempts to persuade him to sign a new contract, he still has a year remaining on his deal and the club have become notorious for difficult negotiations. Ramos also missed a window of opportunity during the summer, when he could have walked away upon payment of \u0080500,000 (\u00a3340,000). That July 7 deadline has now passed and their president will react angrily to his departure. Sevilla won their first trophy in more than 45 years under Ramos and he has led them to five in the past 15 months alone. Sunday's Super Cup went with the Copa del Rey, two successive Uefa Cup victories, and last season's European Super Cup, plus a first-ever place in the Champions League off the back of a season in which they went into the final day with the title still a possibility. All done with a budget a seventh the size of Real Madrid's. For Jol, it seems there is no way back. Levy fears that the Dutchman lacks the wit to outmanoeuvre his counterparts at the big four - Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal - and feels that hewould be neglecting his duties were he not to cast around for alternatives. Accordingly, he authorised Kemsley and Alexander to do a deal with Ramos at their meeting in Spanish city on Friday night. Tottenham started the season with two defeats, at promoted Sunderland and at home to Everton, to set the alarm bells ringing but they coped with the pressure of last Saturday's must-win fixture against Derby County at White Hart Lane, winning 4-0. Jol admitted that the consequences of defeat against Derby would have been \"horrendous\" but his players performed for him and are thought to be divided over the prospect of him leaving. Jol has also been hit by injuries, particularly in defence, and he continues to feel that when he has everyone available he has a team to rival any in the top four. The chances of him being around to select it now appear slim indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
