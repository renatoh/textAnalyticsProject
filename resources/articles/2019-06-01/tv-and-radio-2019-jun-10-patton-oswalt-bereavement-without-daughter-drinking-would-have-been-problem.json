The chronic depressive comedian. It is one of the greatest cliches in showbusiness. Patton Oswalt \u2013 ebullient, life-affirming, swearing as he hurtles along the Interstate 10 highway in California \u2013 does not sound like one of those. At least, not any more. Oswalt\u2019s wife, the true-crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in 2016 at the age of 46. That was the second-worst day of Oswalt\u2019s life. The worst was breaking the news to their seven-year-old daughter, Alice, the next day. Three years later, Oswalt, aged 50, is healing. An atheist, he found salvation in single fatherhood. He remarried with no apology to trolls shouting: \u201cToo soon!\u201d His career flourished on stage, TV and film. And he is very excited about a European tour that finishes in London on 15 June. Oswalt \u2013 whose CV includes The King of Queens, Ratatouille, Young Adult, Veep and the upcoming The Secret Life of Pets 2 \u2013 seems like a man firing on all cylinders. He and McNamara must have been quite a double act, everyone\u2019s favourite dinner conversationalists. McNamara was obsessive about unsolved crimes. She created a website, True Crime Diary, that covered breaking stories and cold cases, looking for new angles that police had missed. It may sound morbid to some, but not the way Oswalt recalls it. \u201cShe was just a really deep storyteller, and really good storytelling is about solving problems \u2013 and all of your problems tend to be people,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, with a true crime, especially a cold case, it was almost like the writer and humanitarian sensibility of her was offended that we have all this technology, we have all these clues, we have all this insight: why is this person not caught? And I think that ended up being something that really intrigued her.\u201d McNamara was animated by one whodunnit in particular: more than a dozen murders and at least 50 rapes in California between 1976 and 1986. Some had named the unknown perpetrator the East Area Rapist, others the Original Night Stalker. McNamara coined Golden State Killer and it stuck. She was working on a book about the case, I\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark, at the time of her death. But there were two posthumous postscripts. Using her handwritten notes and thousands of files on her computer, Oswalt ensured the book was finished and published with the help of Paul Haynes, the lead researcher on the case, and Billy Jensen, an investigative journalist. Then, four days after the second anniversary of McNamara\u2019s death, authorities announced that a 72-year-old man named Joseph James DeAngelo had been arrested in California after DNA evidence that linked him to the case was taken from a discarded tissue in his rubbish and the handle of his car door. He has since been charged with offences including 13 murders and 13 crimes related to sexual assault. The breakthrough had taken 42 years. Does Oswalt believe that his wife\u2019s work was responsible? \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it,\u201d he says. \u201cPaul Haynes and the other homicide detective said she definitely put a lot more light back on that case and got a lot more interest and resources put back into it. I\u2019m going to say an objectively proven yes on that one.\u201d When DeAngelo was arrested, the feeling was \u201cobviously bittersweet\u201d, Oswalt says. \u201cI would have gone: \u2018Off you go, I\u2019ll take care of Alice. You\u2019ve got work to do.\u2019 But at the same time she would have gone: \u2018I don\u2019t care about credit. I just want to know [the perpetrator is] locked up. That\u2019s all I care about. Both for the victims and just for the basic overall sanity of the reality that we live in, the guy should be rotting in jail.\u2019\u201d DeAngelo is awaiting trial. \u201cPart of me would like to visit him, but I would only specifically ask him the questions that Michelle outlined at the end of her book. I wouldn\u2019t have any deeper insight to bring to him than Michelle or these investigators did.\u201d The phrase Golden State Killer captures a California paradox: bright sunshine mixed with the pitted noir of Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. Oswalt\u2019s own natural light was dimmed on 21 April 2016 when he found McNamara in their bed, no longer breathing. Paramedics were called and pronounced her dead. An autopsy found she had an undiagnosed heart condition and had taken a mix of prescription drugs, including the amphetamine combination Adderall, the opioid painkiller fentanyl and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. Full of dread, Oswalt told Alice the next day. \u201cI looked at my daughter and destroyed her world,\u201d he recounted in his subsequent standup show, Annihilation, the second half of which describes the tragedy with searing yet humorous honesty. \u201cI had to look at this little girl that was everything to me and take everything from her.\u201d Suddenly, in his late 40s, he found himself a widower and a single dad. He admits: \u201cI can say with a pretty good amount of confidence that if I hadn\u2019t had Alice, if I didn\u2019t have a daughter, I think I\u2019d be alive right now, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be functioning very well. Drinking would have been a problem. Binge-eating would have been a problem. And then, I think, old-fashioned, almost Victorian melancholy. I would have merely existed. I would have just eaten to live and then would have drunk so that I didn\u2019t feel anything any more and then would have repeated it every single day. Having Alice was like: \u2018I\u2019ve got to get up, I\u2019ve got to make breakfast, I got to take care of this little life.\u2019 So, it\u2019s almost like I had freedom from choice because I had our daughter.\u201d He continues: \u201cThe thing that people don\u2019t tell you is, when you\u2019re going through grief, every single thing that you do \u2013 no matter how mundane: making breakfast for your daughter, doing laundry \u2013 is part of your healing process, whether you want it to be or not. You are basically rebuilding your psyche, whether it\u2019s in something \u2018elevated\u2019 like writing, or quotidian like paying bills.\u201d The \u201cshadow slog\u201d, as he has called it, also included counselling and reading A Grief Observed by CS Lewis; the author of The Chronicles of Narnia was also an influential Christian thinker. Not that Oswalt turned to God. Not for a moment. \u201cI wanted to give Alice more hope in the daily waking life than: \u2018Oh, in some far-off make-believe world maybe we\u2019ll see her in the clouds.\u2019 That to me felt insulting to this very inquisitive, very precocious little girl that Michelle had raised to be very sceptical and smart and loving and compassionate. To just go: \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to believe in this fairytale and then just not think about it,\u2019 ... I wouldn\u2019t dismiss her curiosity that way.\u201d Was McNamara\u2019s death a reminder of Oswalt\u2019s own mortality? \u201cI found consolation in stuff Michelle used to say to me because she was a true-crime investigator. One of the phrases she hated was when people go: \u2018Well, everything happens for a reason.\u2019 She\u2019s like: \u2018No, it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s all random. If you want reason, if you want some grace in the world, be kind.\u2019 The only reason and grace we have coming is whatever you put out there.\u201d Oswalt\u2019s mother was a lapsed Catholic, his father \u201ca kind of \u2018meh\u2019 Lutheran\u201d. The fact that McNamara died, rather than Oswalt, only reinforced his view that there is no cosmic conductor. \u201cLet\u2019s say I did believe that this was part of God\u2019s plan. Well, then, what a shitty plan. You\u2019ve got this true-crime investigator, this genius on the trail of these cold cases, and then a guy that tells dick jokes, and you\u2019re going to take one of them and you take the crime investigator? That\u2019s the stupidest thing on the planet.\u201d In July 2017, Oswalt announced his engagement to the actor Meredith Salenger. The reaction online was divided. Some offered congratulations and expressed delight that he had discovered happiness again. Others suggested he was remarrying with indecent haste. Oswalt gives that societal taboo short shrift. \u201cThe \u2018pushback\u2019 I got was from anonymous people on the internet. With 90% of internet pushback, it\u2019s not anybody actually morally outraged at anything; they\u2019re just bored. One friend of mine got married nine months after his wife passed and everyone gave him shit. Another got married six years after his wife passed and people were like: \u2018You waited too long. This isn\u2019t real.\u2019 So, there\u2019s always going to be people who say: \u2018I like you when you\u2019re mourning because then I\u2019ve got this little lamb that I get to take care of. How dare you move on?\u2019 I feel like I\u2019m only living this life. I don\u2019t owe anyone else anything else.\u201d Virginia-born Oswalt, who is the son of a US Marine and was named after the second world war general George Patton, has been equally pugnacious when talking or tweeting about politics. But unlike garrulous Hollywood types such as John Cusack, Robert De Niro and Rob Reiner, he has grown weary of being asked about Donald Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s terrible for comedians,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is the point? He does not give a shit. You can\u2019t do jokes about someone who is not connected to humanity or shame or anything other than immediate, libidinal pleasure. That\u2019s all it is for him. It\u2019s whatever is literally in front of him. It\u2019d be like trying to shame a shark or a tornado. They\u2019re just like: \u2018If it\u2019s in front of me, I\u2019ll eat it; if not, I\u2019ll swim till I see something else to eat.\u201d Shamelessness is Trump\u2019s superpower? \u201cIt kind of is. It\u2019s his Green Lantern ring.\u201d Yet Oswalt remains fundamentally optimistic about the future of the country, \u201cif only because I\u2019ve read so much American history and I\u2019ve seen how much closer to the brink we have been as a nation. Also, I feel we\u2019re sounding alarm or despair to a Brit, but you guys have lasted so much longer under way more precarious conditions than we have. You\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, you adorable Americans with your: \u201cOh my God, this is the end of America.\u201d Why don\u2019t you guys take a deep breath and read some British history? We\u2019ve been way closer to disaster than this. So, not to use the old cliche, but Keep Calm and Carry the Fuck On.\u2019\u201d It is a principle that Oswalt applies to his own life. He found love again. His daughter, Alice, is now 10. He is on tour and his screen career is going great guns. The trauma of 2016 is in the rear-view mirror. But it will never be gone. \u201cI don\u2019t think of it as often as I did,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve heard in my grief group: you think of it less and less every day of your life, because that\u2019s how healing works. There are times when a snippet of a song or just a feel in the air will remind me of her. That will always be there. But life forces you to move on whether you want to or not.\u201d Patton Oswalt is at the O2 Forum Kentish Town, London, on 15 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
