Michael Todd, a policeman for more than 30 years, had gone walking in the Snowdonia region while off duty yesterday, his force said. A search was launched after he failed to return. Rescue teams found a body believed to be that of the 50-year-old this afternoon, Greater Manchester's deputy chief constable, Dave Whatton. told reporters. The body has yet to be formally identified. \"The weather conditions are extremely bad at the moment and are hindering our inquiries,\" Whatton said. \"As you can imagine all of his friends and colleagues are extremely upset. Our hearts and thoughts are with his family, and I would ask that they be left in peace to come to terms with this tragic shock.\" The search operation involved two mountain rescue teams and an RAF helicopter. Todd's body might not be recovered until late this evening, an RAF spokesman said. First joining Essex police in 1976, Todd rose to become an assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police where his duties included overseeing the policing of major events such as the May Day demonstrations and the Notting Hill Carnival. Married with three children, a daughter and twin sons, Todd also served with the Nottinghamshire force. The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said she was \"saddened\" at the news. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, said Todd made a \"significant contribution to policing\". \"In London, this culminated in him being assistant commissioner for territorial policing and leading the important fight against street crime,\" he said. \"He was held in high esteem and I and colleagues who knew him are truly shocked by this terrible news.\" As vice-president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Todd led an inquiry into allegations that CIA rendition flights landed in the UK. Todd was known as being particularly media-friendly - his Greater Manchester police profile notes that he gave 66 separate radio and TV interviews during the 2001 May Day demonstrations in London. He joined Greater Manchester police as chief constable in 2002. In 2005, in a public attempt to demonstrate the safety of Taser guns, Todd was filmed receiving a 50,000-volt jolt to his back from one of the incapacitation weapons. Collapsing in agony, he said later: \"And yes, it hurt like hell and no, I wouldn't want to do it again.\" Video footage of the event was released last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
