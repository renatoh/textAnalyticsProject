It was tough, tight and tense but also frustratingly stodgy, and the fact that it was clinched by a highly debatable video refereeing decision was an appropriately downbeat end to an underwhelming Super League season. Three of the four tries in the competition's showpiece occasion were scored from kicks and the fourth from acting half, and although Leeds have shown admirable resolve to defend their title for a second time, even they have spent most of the campaign being frustrated by the referees' increased tolerance of delaying tactics around the rucks. That could have frightening implications for the forthcoming Four Nations series, for which England's squad will be announced today, with the only realistic prospect of home success appearing to lie in dragging Australia and New Zealand down to Super League level. The fleeting glimpses of the southern hemisphere's National Rugby League that have been possible this year \u2013 before the collapse of Setanta in the spring, and then on ESPN during the latter stages of the NRL play-offs \u2013 have revealed a game that appears to have cranked up another gear since the introduction of two referees for each match, one of them charged with eliminating the wrestling tactics that had been causing such controversy. Fortunately for England only one referee will be used during the Four Nations matches because the international rules have not been changed. However, the St Helens coach, Mick Potter \u2013 who could not be accused of sour grapes, as he refused several opportunities to complain about the video refereeing decision that led to Lee Smith's crucial second try \u2013 believes the British game would benefit from following the NRL's example. \"Certainly two sets of eyes close by the ruck is I think a good thing,\" said Potter. \"It's proven in Oz that it's sped the game up and I think you are seeing more entertaining games. If you want more tries scored you probably need to look at it.\" He added of the wrestling that has slowed down the Super League this year: \"If you want a dour, hard type of game you can keep it in.\" There is no chance of the Rugby Football League switching to two referees, because it would be too expensive and there is already a shortage of suitably qualified officials. But the top priority this winter for the RFL's referees controller, Stuart Cummings, must surely be to work with the leading Super League coaches to clamp down on wrestling and speed up the rucks. Average attendances have fallen slightly this season, and although that may be largely down to the recession, anecdotal evidence suggests a growing number of spectators disgruntled by the fare on the field. The St Helens fans seem to be the unhappiest of the lot, and a dramatic slump in their support was the main reason Saturday's attendance was the lowest for the match since 2002. Potter will inevitably take most of the blame for the club's worst season since 2003, but Saints' previous attacking brilliance was built on quick play-the-balls, and it has been his misfortune to take over when key players such as James Roby and Leon Pryce have been able to do far less damage. Leeds have benefited from having more play-making options, with Danny McGuire having been consistently the most probing and creative player in the Super League all season as he showed again on Saturday by putting in the two delicate kicks that led to Smith's double. But Sinfield remains the Rhinos' leading light. He offers such a range of qualities to the team and the club, which were underlined again as he defied an early knock to a fractured cheekbone and dedicated the win to the late, great stand-off John Holmes. There was a perfect 40-20 kick in the first half, a preconceived drop goal to establish a 9-8 lead early in the second and a flying cover tackle on Kyle Eastmond in the 68th minute that was the game's single most exciting and significant moment, denying Saints' most dangerous attacker a second try that would have put them 14-11 ahead. Within five minutes the latest in Francis Meli's long list of Old Trafford howlers had handed Leeds the position from which Smith touched down McGuire's improvised left-footed grubber. One of Sky's replays appeared to show the Wasps-bound centre fractionally offside but the video referee, Phil Bentham, awarded the try anyway, a wholly unnecessary controversy that would have been avoided if the benefit of the doubt was always given to the defensive team \u2013 something else that needs changing in a crucial off-season for the credibility of the British game.
