Let us take the example of plastic, that despoiler of our beaches, countryside and urban areas. Nearly all solid plastic containers used today have a recycling logo embossed on them or a notice to say that they are not yet recyclable. Yet, up and down the country, different local authorities set up different regimes for which types of plastic, differentiated by an often near indecipherable number in the centre of the logo, they are willing to take, if any. This has to change. All plastic containers should be taxed, maybe differentially according to how easy it is for that type of plastic to be reused or recycled, and the revenue ringfenced to support reuse and recycling. The tax should fall on container producers and users in some suitable proportion. This should make supermarkets think twice before using them, and thus lead to reduction. All local authorities should be obliged to take and recycle all plastic containers with a recycling logo and employ people to separate and process them or support social enterprises set up for the purpose \u2013 this process to be paid for by the ringfenced tax. Paul Roberts Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022\u2008I allowed myself to believe that there might be some new, original thinking from our new government. Then along came Eric Pickles and Caroline Spelman to announce a completely inane policy in which householders will be rewarded with vouchers for recycling more rubbish by weight. I have the image of people collecting vast quantities of free newspapers and putting them in the bin to earn vouchers which they can exchange for more rubbish. I really urge government to, er, bin this idea. Any policy which uses reward at its core is doomed. The only way to achieve success is by punishment. The vast majority of people are lazy when it comes to recycling (myself included) and they need to be shown, through their wallets, how to do it better. Council tax bills need to have the component for waste collection levied by a separate invoice issued to each householder. The householder can then vary the size of this invoice by choosing the size of bin, and the frequency of its collection. It works, believe me. Rob Jacques Freiburg, Germany \u2022\u2008You don't have to support charges for domestic waste collection to question the government's decision to prohibit them (Report, 7 June). If this is an example of the new localism and its pledge to devolve powers to local government, can we assume that the proposed and much-vaunted power of general competence will be restricted to local policies of which the government approves?
