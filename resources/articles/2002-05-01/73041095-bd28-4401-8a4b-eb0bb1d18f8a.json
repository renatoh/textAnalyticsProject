A Football Association of Wales disciplinary panel yesterday found the club guilty of misconduct after fighting broke out following a pitch invasion at the end of the tie. But Cardiff escaped punishment for the consistent throwing of missiles during the game after the commission decided the charge was not proven. Various objects - including coins and a shoe - were hurled at the Leeds players and the referee Andy D'Urso who, at one stage, needed treatment before continuing. As well paying the full costs of the hearing, Cardiff have been told to print half-page crowd warning notices in all match-day programmes next season. The club must also put up warning notices inside and outside Ninian Park. As Cardiff consider an appeal, their chief executive David Temme said the club respected the FAW's decision which, the club believes, follows pressure from the Football Association and London media. He said the club disagreed with the commission's conclusion about the pitch invasion and welcomed the low level of fine. No mention was made by the FAW of the Cardiff owner Sam Hammam's controversial walk around the ground in front of the Leeds fans as the game reached its climax. Stoke City, conquerors of Cardiff in the play-off semi-finals, have terminated the contract of the manager Gudjon Thordarson just five days after the Icelander led the club to the First Division via the final triumph over Brentford. The chairman Gunnar Gislason claimed the relationship between Thordarson, who took charge in 1999, and the board was \"untenable\". A Stoke statement said: \"The manager has not always appreciated the financial constraints within which he has had to work.\" Laurent Blanc is close to accepting Manchester United's offer to remain at Old Trafford for another year after further talks with Sir Alex Ferguson. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
