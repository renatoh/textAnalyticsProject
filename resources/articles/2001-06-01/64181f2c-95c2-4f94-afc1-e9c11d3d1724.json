The former BG boss, a Catford-born sailing enthusiast who initially balked at taking the job and had already turned down the Railtrack chairmanship, will be reunited with Philip Hampton, who worked alongside him as finance director at BG and last autumn took the same role at BT. The move attracted a rare burst of praise from City analysts, who said BT was finally making decisive steps towards change in the hands of demerger specialists. The share price rose 15.25p to 448.75p, ahead of tomorrow's closing date for the company's record-breaking \u00a35.9bn rights issue. The appointment was announced as BT sold its telephone exchanges, offices and warehouses for \u00a32.3bn to reduce its \u00a330bn debt. The estate has been bought by a joint venture between Land Securities and William Pears Group. Mr Varney faces a tough job in knocking BT Wireless into shape. The business, valued at \u00a320bn, owns the BT Cellnet mobile, which trails Vodafone and could soon be overtaken by Orange. Yesterday Mr Varney insisted that he was ready for the challenge. He said: \"My key experience at BG was in delivering superior shareholder value, and in getting a company which was not very well regarded to be much better regarded.\" He is expected to join Mr Hampton in ridding BT of its remaining state monopoly/civil service mentality, introducing a culture change that will, friends say, \"upset a lot of people\". Industry sources said Mr Varney, 55, was initially reluctant to take on the job for fear that he would be seen as a potential successor to BT's poorly regarded chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield. Mr Varney dismissed this:\"This is an exciting industry. I'm looking forward to working with Peter and his colleagues, and I'm delighted to have the opportunity to help.\" BT's shares have halved over 12 months. Among the biggest gripes from investors has been the company's failure to lead the industry in adapting to the internet and mobile phones. BT Wireless is central to this, and its demerger later this year is intended to cut it free to invest in new technology. Mr Varney said it was tough to match expectations of mobile phones with reality. \"Like with all new developments, you get a combination of optimism in changing the power of technology and difficulty in changing human behaviour.\" BT Cellnet and mobile internet business Genie had an admirable record in terms of technical innovation. Asked whether Cellnet was a superior network to Vodafone and Orange, he refused to be drawn. \"I don't think, on day one, I want to start by getting involved in those sort of conversations,\" he said. The City questioned his telecoms experience but friends said: \"He's not a telecoms virgin as BG (through Transco, its pipelines business) is investing heavily in building a network and he was a non-exec at Cable &amp; Wireless.\" A former National Union of Students leader, Mr Varney used to chair the New Deal employment initiative in London. He makes frequent speeches about the social responsibilities which come with business, and is said to have been deeply influenced by the Brent Spar oil rig episode while working at Shell. He said: \"I am interested in the way business interacts with the community. If you take my last job, I was running a utility with vans parked all over the place. If your company is viewed with a degree of affection and respect, you won't get your vans vandalised.\" Mr Varney hopes to invoke similar principles at BT Wireless. \"The whole technological infrastructure which mobile phones are providing can clearly play a role in the voluntary and community sector,\" he said. Analysts said Mr Varney's appointment was a positive sign. James McCafferty of SG Securities said: \"It shows BT is getting the business into shape and is serious about demerger.\" Mr McCafferty said BT Wireless was limited in its geographical scope, with operations in just four countries - Britain, Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands. \"That's not, in itself, a strong portfolio and it means the business is a candidate for consolidation.\" There has been speculation that BT Wireless could be ripe for a tie-up with either Telecom Italia or Telefonica Moviles of Spain. The cost of securing a licence to build a third-generation mobile phone network in Britain has left BT with enormous debt. Yesterday's sale of almost 7,000 properties will help to alleviate the burden of repayments. BT has offloaded almost all its operational buildings with the exception of landmarks such as the BT Tower in London and the group's head office near St Paul's cathedral. BT will rent space in the properties from the new owners. BT will today complete a month-long charm offensive aimed at persuading investors to back its fundraising, which will be the biggest factor in restoring its balance sheet. Many private investors are shunning the fundraising and in some cases, support from institutions has been grudging. Whether the rights issue is successful or not, the five-year tenure of Sir Peter Bonfield could be nearing an end. The 57-year-old chief executive recently insisted he was \"not a quitter\" and said he listened to Eric Clapton to relieve stress. Some shareholders are demanding that he spends more time with his music. To buy or not to buy What's being offered? BT shareholders are being given the right to buy an extra three shares for every 10 they own. The rights issue shares are priced at 300p each, a deep discount to yesterday's close of 450p and 47% less than when the move was announced. BT hopes to raise \u00a35.9bn. Why? BT has debts of \u00a330bn. In the last financial year it lost \u00a31bn before tax but has promised to cut debts by \u00a310bn by the year's end. Several investments and properties have been sold; costs of building mobile networks are to be shared. BT will be split in two: its fixed line business and BT Wireless, including Cellnet. What's in it for investors? The chance to pick up cheap BT shares. Shareholders must either take up their rights or end up owning proportionally fewer shares. Those who decline will have their \"rights\" sold and receive a cheque. What's the outlook for BT? Bulls say the shares have dropped too low, new chairman Sir Christopher Bland is starting to solve problems, disposals are helping, the demerger of BT Wireless is strategically sensible and the rights issue will offer stability. Bears saythe shares are likely to continue to slide in a market where telecoms stocks have fallen out of favour. What will the City do? Other telecoms firms are trying to sell shares to institutions, so it is a buyers' market. BT's biggest shareholders have given a reluctant thumbs-up. And small investors? Many of the 1.8m small shareholders remain undecided. Novice investors feel aggrieved by the loss of the shares' value and may not take up their rights. Others may give BT a second chance. How long do investors have to make up their minds? Almost no time at all. Acceptance forms must be with be with BT's registrars by 9.30am tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
