I know that\u2019s an evergreen question (and the answer is normally yes), but in this particular instance I\u2019m talking about the US women\u2019s soccer team (USWNT) thrashing Thailand 13-0 in the World Cup on Tuesday. Despite being a record-breaking performance, the exuberance with which USA celebrated goal after goal after goal has prompted criticism and accusations of unsporting behavior. A lot of this criticism, it should be said, came from male sports commentators. \u201cThe goal celebrations at 9-0, 10-0, 11-0 are so overboard. Why are they even trying to score any more? I\u2019m on team Thailand at this point,\u201d said Jeff Paterson, a Canadian sports reporter. \u201c0.0 problem with the scoreline as this is the tournament, but celebrating goals (like No 9) leaves a sour taste in my mouth,\u201d Taylor Twellman, an ESPN analyst and former player for the US men\u2019s national team, said on Twitter. And commentator Max Bretos similarly tweeted: \u201cI would tone down the celebration on the ninth goal, but that\u2019s just me.\u201d There is something infuriating about a bunch of male commentators telling the world\u2019s best women\u2019s soccer team: Tone it down, ladies! It smacks of sexism, as many people were quick to point out. Responding to the criticism, Abby Wambach, a former player for the USWNT, tweeted: \u201cFor all that have issue with many goals: for some players this is [their] first World Cup goal, and they should be excited. Would you tell a men\u2019s team to not score or celebrate?\u201d Wambach followed this up by noting: \u201c[T]his isn\u2019t rec league soccer. This is THE WORLD CUP!!!!!!!!! Stop judging these women with patriarchal glasses. You would never say this about a men\u2019s team. Period.\u201d I understand Wambach\u2019s frustration; I\u2019m sure every woman does. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re on a soccer pitch or in a boardroom \u2013 being a woman means constantly battling impossible double standards. If you\u2019re too friendly you\u2019re considered unprofessional; if you\u2019re not friendly enough you\u2019re considered a bitch. If you speak up, you\u2019re told you\u2019re too aggressive or emotional; if you don\u2019t speak up you\u2019re told you\u2019re not assertive enough. You can basically never win when you\u2019re a woman, even when you win 13-0. Professional sport is particularly rife with double standards; female players are rarely given the same levels of respect as their male peers. They\u2019re certainly not given the same levels of compensation. The USWNT is currently in the middle of a federal lawsuit against US Soccer, alleging \u201cinstitutional gender discrimination\u201d. US Soccer\u2019s response to this lawsuit has essentially been to claim that the women\u2019s team \u2013 three-time World Cup winners \u2013 isn\u2019t entitled to equal pay with the men\u2019s team because they\u2019re not performing equal work. This is beyond patronizing. Did sexism play a part in the criticism leveled against the US performance on Tuesday? Absolutely. Does that mean that none of the criticism is valid? Absolutely not. While Wambach is right to point out double standards, she is wrong to boil everything down to sexism. You don\u2019t have to be wearing \u201cpatriarchal glasses\u201d to think that USA could have behaved a lot more decently on Tuesday. I\u2019m not saying they should have taken it easy on Thailand or scored fewer goals \u2013 but there was no need to be quite so over-the-top in their celebration, especially when they were playing a team that was clearly the underdog. The exuberance wouldn\u2019t have been an issue if USA had thrashed France 13-0, but this wasn\u2019t a fair fight. The celebration felt unnecessary and cruel. Plenty of female athletes have pointed this out, including Hope Solo, the team\u2019s former goalkeeper, who acknowledged in the Guardian that \u201csome of the celebrations were a little overboard\u201d. Clare Rustead, a Canadian soccer analyst and former player, was more blunt, calling the performance \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and tweeting: \u201cThe USWNT displayed poor sportsmanship excessively celebrating many of the 13 goals against a 34th-ranked team. It has nothing to do with the final score. You are one of the best teams in the world. Act like it. And yeah, I definitely would have said the same about a men\u2019s team.\u201d It\u2019s important that we call out double standards, but it\u2019s also important that women don\u2019t cry \u201csexism\u201d to absolve ourselves of bad behavior. The USWNT\u2019s behavior on Tuesday was objectively disappointing; they could and should have performed a lot better. But with all that said, I would like to reiterate that it\u2019s a brilliant team full of inspiring women, and I\u2019m rooting for them all the way. (Unless they play England, in which case I\u2019m hoping they get thrashed 13-0.) Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
