The full-back will be the sixth 30-something in the squad charged with ending the club's 19-year exile from the top flight. That contingent will be swelled further if the defender's former Manchester United team-mate Paul Ince completes his protracted move. It is somewhat apt that this Dad's Army are managed by Dave \"Corporal\" Jones, yet previous regimes have also made a habit of signing players past, or fast approaching, their sell-by dates. The former England internationals Andy Sinton, Tony Daley and Gordon Cowans are others who have pitched up at Wolves in the recent past. Their contributions reinforced the impression of a club who were long on experience but short on hunger with Molineux not only the stage for old gold shirts but also for golden handshakes. Sir Jack Hayward, who has spent more than \u00a340m of his fortune on the club, described himself as the \"golden tit\" after one of the many abortive attempts to climb out of the First Division. Judging from the persuasive case Irwin has made for joining Wolves, however, it is unlikely that the multi-millionaire chairman will have cause to rue his latest investment. The former Republic of Ireland international has left no doubt that he still hankers for the roar of the crowd and smell of Elliman's Rub. There will be plenty of the former, given that the club have already sold almost 17,000 season tickets despite the disappointing end to last season's promotion bid. Irwin may be 36 going on 37, and may not need the money after more than a decade at Old Trafford supplemented by a lucrative testimonial, but such is his motivation that it is understood he has taken a substantial pay cut to continue playing. \"There was never a temptation to pack in after United,\" says Irwin who, by winning 15 medals in a dozen years, was the club's most decorated player. \"It was an option to say I can't improve on this and retire. But I feel capable of playing for another year or two and am looking forward to this season. \"The simple answer is that I want to keep playing and this is a great challenge after what I achieved with United. There will be plenty of years when I can't play and, as long as I feel fit enough, I'll carry on.\" His desire to play on is not the only item of unfinished business: by signing for Wolves he has joined the club he supported as a boy. \"Most of my friends in Cork followed United or Liverpool but a couple of us supported Wolves,\" says Irwin, who had not set foot inside Molineux until he arrived to sign his one-year contract. Coincidentally, the decline which saw Wolves drop into the old Fourth Division and to the bronk of financial oblivion began just as Irwin was launching a career which brought rejection at Leeds United before his arrival at Old Trafford via Oldham Athletic. He has set his sights on helping Wolves back to the top level but knows from his experience that, although United made winning trophies look easy, it never was. \"This is a new challenge, a new set of lads and the club are all geared up for the Premiership,\" he says. \"But that's not enough. Hard work is needed. The club went close last year and I think they've brought me in to add a bit of experience. \"There's a lot of competition for the three places - Derby County and Leicester City will present a challenge and Ipswich Town have some good players - so it will be a tough division to get out of. But I've seen the players here and the depth of the squad and I'm sure they're more than capable of doing it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
