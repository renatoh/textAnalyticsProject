Not only has Republican senator Rand Paul done that, he has blamed the national debt on the existence of a central bank, a leap of logic so great that it would seem to land the senator well beyond any accusation of being in any way an un-original thinker. The man is clearly a standalone intellect. And yet Paul finds himself embroiled in allegations of having committed the quintessential crime of intellectual dependency: plagiarism. At least three recent examples have emerged of Paul using words not his own to make salient points on topics as diverse as immigration and criminal justice. Confronted on Tuesday by the New York Times about the apparent pilfering in speeches and in print, Paul committed a further sin, one far more serious, for a politician, than plagiarism. He got really defensive. \u201cWhat we are going to do from here forward, if it will make people leave me the hell alone, is we\u2019re going to do them like college papers,\u201d Paul told the Times, referring to his public materials. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to put out footnotes.\" It is rare for a prospective presidential candidate to reveal a wish to be left the hell alone. However it had been a turbulent few days for Paul. The tetchy interview followed days of enthusiastic news coverage of the apparent plagiarism, which began when MSNBC host Rachel Maddow noticed that Paul, in an October stump speech in Virginia, had cribbed his description of the movie Gattaca from Wikipedia. Then it emerged that Paul pulled something similar with Stand and Deliver in a speech in June. Then Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski discovered that Paul had published an op-ed and delivered Senate testimony about mandatory sentencing that leaned rather heavily on an article in The Week. The composite sketch is of Paul, or his speechwriters, or a combination of the two, snapping up words and ideas from wherever they might be handy \u2013 with Hollywood holding particular sway \u2013 and passing them off as Paul's. In the Times interview, Paul said he was probably over-scheduled. He did not, admirably, blame his staff, and he said no one faces firing over the incident. Paul is not above assigning any blame, however. In an interview Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week, Paul said \u201chacks and haters\u201d were trying to manufacture controversy over relatively minor transgressions. \"I take it as an insult and I will not lie down and say people can call me dishonest, misleading or misrepresenting,\" Paul told host George Stephanopoulos. \"I have never intentionally done so.\" \"And like I say, if, you know, if dueling were legal in Kentucky, if they keep it up, you know, it would be a duel challenge. But I can't do that, because I can't hold office in Kentucky then.\" Clint Eastwood could not have said it better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
