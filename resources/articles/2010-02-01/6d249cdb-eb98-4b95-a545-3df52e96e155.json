Six unnamed Giants players remain under investigation after being arrested during a pre-season training trip to Newcastle but the hopes of their coach, Nathan Brown, that the squad would pull together were realised. Huddersfield were reduced to 12 men for two 10-minute spells in the second half as Luke Robinson and then the debutant Lee Gilmour were sent to the sin-bin. But the commitment of their defence spoke eloquently for their team spirit and condemned a new-look Bradford team to a dispiriting night. \"We built last year on effort and commitment to each other and that was there to see tonight,\" said Brown, whose plans were disrupted by the loss of the prop Keith Mason with a torn pectoral muscle in the opening exchanges. Brown was critical of senior players including Gilmour for their indiscipline but praised the captain and reigning Man of Steel, Brett Hodgson, for creating two tries for Leroy Cudjoe. With Shaun Lunt also wriggling over from close range, the Giants surged to a 16-0 lead in 23 minutes as a Bradford team including five new signings struggled to settle. One of those signings, the former Great Britain wing Stuart Reardon, had been caught out by Hodgson for Cudjoe's double but he made some amends by scoring a couple himself, the first of which put the Bulls on the board late in the first half. Rikki Sheriffe also scored after a clever kick from Bradford's Australian debutant, Matt Orford, to reduce the deficit to 16-8. But Huddersfield stretched away again when one of their newcomers, the New Zealand second-row David Fa'alogo, crashed over from Lunt's pass. They then lost Robinson to the bin for holding down the tackled player once too often but they coped well with his absence as Hodgson extended the lead to 24-8 with a penalty. The loss of Gilmour for a late tackle hit them harder, with Reardon struggling over for a second try that few could see clearly because of the thickening fog. But despite plenty more pressure Bradford were unable to break through again. \"We did some things in the first half that were unacceptable in terms of losing possession and we were chasing the game after that,\" said their coach, Steve McNamara. Some consolation for Bradford's substantial support came with news of a surprise 24-10 home defeat for the champions, Leeds, against Castleford at Headingley.
