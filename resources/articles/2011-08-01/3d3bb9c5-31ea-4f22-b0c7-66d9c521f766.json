Warning the government against backtracking on its fiscal plans, Fathom Consulting says ditching austerity now would force the Bank of England into an early increase in interest rates, and that the bond markets would punish the UK by demanding a higher risk premium on government gilts. Erik Britton, one of Fathom's directors, says: \"There is a lot of talk at the moment about how the coalition should backtrack on fiscal austerity. That is the worst thing they could do. At best, it would trigger a monetary tightening \u2013 at worst a sovereign debt crisis.\" With the state of the economy set to dominate UK politics this autumn, the consultancy says it has long believed that the UK should have a loose monetary policy \u2013 low interest rates and a weak pound \u2013 coupled with ultra-tight fiscal policy. \"But in the past week, debate, led by the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, over whether the government should backtrack on fiscal austerity, has intensified,\" the consultancy says. \"Despite this, Fathom believes the austerity package should still be implemented \u2013 even in the event of the downside risk materialising.\" Balls has argued that the government's deficit reduction programme will be counterproductive, because higher taxes and public spending cuts will lead to higher borrowing. Fathom says the UK's prospects were poor. \"Debt is a millstone round the neck of the UK's recovery: at best, a profound drag on growth; at worst, something that tips us back into recession,\" the consultancy says. During the house-price boom of the early and middle 2000s, private debt levels in the UK reached a record 150% of national output. However, they have started to fall back in recent years, as the property market has stagnated and individuals have lost their appetite for borrowing. This process has a lot further to run, Fathom says. \"The UK has entered a de-leveraging cycle and it is essential this cycle runs its course. We have run up a colossal debt burden; now it is payback time. As we climb down the debt mountain, subdued growth is inevitable and is set to last for up to a decade.\" The consultancy says that in the event of a full-blown sovereign debt crisis, a recession in the UK would be \"inevitable\" but adds that abandoning austerity now would be \"disastrous\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
