The piece cites a recruiter with experience of Google HR who says the firm is a natural target for upcoming firms that are ambitious for success on a similar scale; Google has a reputation for paying \"stingy\" salaries, says the piece (this is relative to the tech industry, mind) and also has many employees whose shares in the firm are contracted to ripen after four-five years. \"Most people who went to Google were bright, curious and wanted to solve interesting problems. Nobody went to Google for a salary,\" said Eric Jaquith, the recruiter. Wired lists a handful of Googlers who left for startups but, just to add to their pain, Last.fm announced yesterday that F Scott Woods will be their new senior vice president and managing director Germany - leaving his role as head of strategic partnerships and business development for Germany and Northern Europe after four years at Google. It's great news for Last.fm though, putting an experienced executive in charge of its second largest userbase after the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
