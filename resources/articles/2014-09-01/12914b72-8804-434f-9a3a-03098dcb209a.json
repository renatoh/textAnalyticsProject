Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The United States sought \u2013 and won \u2013 vocal international support for its new military offensive against Isis, as the United Nations general assembly convened. The centerpiece of the American suasion effort was an address in which President Barack Obama called on nations to join \u201ca broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.\u201d British prime minister David Cameron supported military action. \u201cWe need to act, and we need to act now,\u201d he said. Parliament was recalled to meet Friday to discuss the issue. Holland said it was sending jets to fight Isis. Jordan and Turkey vowed to support the cause, as did France. Saudi Arabia and the UAE were named as participants in US-led airstrikes in Syria late Wednesday. The UN security council unanimously adopted a resolution to stanch the flow of \u201cforeign terrorists fighters\u201d into Syria and elsewhere. Late Wednesday afternoon, the Pentagon announced new strikes on oil facilities in Syria which they said netted Isis up to $2m a day. It was the third day of strikes in Syria. The Pentagon said it was still investigating whether US strikes in Syria on Tuesday killed a leader of the al Qaeda-linked Khorasan group. Violence in Iraq continued. Around 200 Iraqi soldiers were said to be trapped by Isis fighters in an army camp south of Ramadi in western Iraq. Isis was said to have reinforced fighters who are battling Kurdish forces for control of the town on Kobani close to the Turkish border. Isis militants killed at least 19 members of a Shia militia in an ambush attack outside Baghdad, Iraqi police said. A Syrian opposition group affiliated with the \u201cmoderate\u201d Free Syrian Army condemned the US-led air strikes in a new video. An Algerian group claiming ties to Isis beheaded a French hostage, a tourist who was captured Sunday. Read the previous blog summary. Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN that U.S. and coalition forces hit 12 targets, including oil refineries that were providing up to $2 million a day in income to the Islamic State group, AP reports. As of Tuesday, according to U.S. Central Command, the U.S. had conducted airstrikes that hit at least 20 locations in Syria. Combat aircraft flew 64 sorties. \u201cInternational partners\u201d (via CNN): ABC News says the strikes are over: At the UN, John Kerry says he has to go and hands the security council chair to ambassador Samantha Power. Here\u2019s hoping she has her afternoon free. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby releases a statement confirming the new air strikes in Syria Wednesday. Via AFP: \u201cI can confirm that US military and Arab partner forces are undertaking additional strikes today against ISIL (Islamic State group) terrorists in Syria,\u201d press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement. \u201cThese operations are ongoing so we will not provide additional details at this time.\u201d Oil facilities held by the militants were among the targets attacked, two US defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP. Syria Deeply has quoted analysts saying Isis makes up to $3m a day selling oil. Earlier today the Iraqi prime minister asked the American president for more weapons, explaining that Isis militants had been stripping the Iraqi army. That is still happening, reports the Washington Post. Saqlawiyah is near Fallujah west of Baghdad. Obama leaves the security council meeting to speak at \u201canother UN forum.\u201d He hands off to US secretary of state John Kerry. \u201cI will note that it is very rare that the UN achieves the kind of consensus that we see represented in this resolution,\u201d he says. The agreement shows, he says, that \u201cThe brand of violent, extreme terrorism [of Isil] is something that must be rejected by all of us in the civilized world.\u201d \u201cIn our fight against terrorism, all actions that our national interest necessitates will be taken,\u201d Erdogan says. He says Turkey hosts 1.3m Syrian refugees and last week alone 140,000 Kurds entered Turkey. \u201cWe have not received the kind of support we\u2019ve been looking for from the international community\u201d he says. Erdogan says Turkey has been \u201ctarget of unjust criticism in this context\u201d. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is next at the UN security council. He says Turkey has been warning the international community about the terrorist threat. \u201cThe spread of Isil\u2019s threat towards Iraq is a result of conditions on the ground and is a result of sectarian policies of the former government,\u201d he says. \u201cTurkey has been taking a leading role... working to prevent the flow of foreign fighters into the region for a long time.\u201d He says the flow starts at original countries \u201cand for a long time we have been calling on the countries concerned to cooperate with us on this issue.\u201d \u201cWe finally witnessed an increased share of information from\u201d origin countries, he says. Erdogan says there are now 6,300 individuals on a no-entry list; close to 1,000 foreigners deported; instituted risk analysis group at airports. Roughly simultaneous with the announcement of renewed strikes against Isis, Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi was invited to address the security council: Reuters snap: PENTAGON CONFIRMS STRIKES UNDERWAY, SAYS WILL PROVIDE DETAILS AS \u201cOPERATIONALLY APPROPRIATE\u201d AFP adds: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi is next. He says China backs the UN resolution against \u201cforeign terrorist fighters\u201d. He expresses condolences to France for the killing of tourist Herv\u00e9 Gourdel in Algeria. \u201cWe must stay alert\u201d against the terrorism threat, he says. \u201cWe would be prepared to cooperate on an equitable bases,\u201d Lavrov says, beginning with an honest assessment, he says, of the real source of the problem we\u2019re trying to solve. Lavrov says the invasion of Iraq, bombing of Libya and arming of the Syrian opposition has greatly exacerbated the problem of foreign fighters. Not the same sources of the problem the United States would likely name. Lavrov says Isis is not the only source of terrorist danger in the region. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is speaking. \u201cRussia has consistently advocated building up international cooperation to [head off] terrorism in any form,\u201d he says. Cameron is done speaking. One passage to highlight: new powers he described that he said would help fight the terror threat. Cameron called for enabling \u201cour police and security services to apply for stronger locational constraints for those who remain within the UK but who pose a risk\u201d: \u201cFor our part in the United Kingdom, we\u2019re introducing new powers to strengthen our ability to seize passports and stop suspects from traveling, to allow us to temporarily some British nationals getting back in the country; to ensure that airlines comply with no-fly lists and security screening arrangements; and to enable our police and security services to apply for stronger locational constraints for those who remain within the UK but who pose a risk.\u201d \u201cThe United Kingdom is committed to meeting this challenge,\u201d Cameron says. \u201c... \u201cWe need to act, and we need to act now.\u201d The British prime minister says \u201cone of the most disturbing aspects of the conflict\u201d is how it is \u201csucking in young people\u201d. He says \u201cin my own country,\u201d 500 \u201cof these fanatics have gone to Syria and Iraq.\u201d British people are sickened that a British citizen could be involved in murdering people, including a fellow British citizen, who had gone to Syria to help people. THere are no easy answers or quick fixes, and I believe we\u2019ll be dealing with this threat for years.\u201d Cameron is speaking at the security council. He says the conflict in Iraq \u201cis shocking the world with its cruelty and barbarity.\u201d Many fascinating lines coming out with the interview with the Iranian president happening in New York now: Update: Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah addresses the security council: \u201cFirst let me thank President Obama for his leadership on this issue, and Jordan can be counted on to play our part.\u201d As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The United Nations security council unanimously adopted a resolution to crack down on flows of \u201cforeign terrorist fighters\u201d. Under Resolution 2178, \u201cnations are required to prevent and suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting or equipping of foreign terrorist fighters, as well as the financing of their travel or activities,\u201d said US President Barack Obama, who is chairing the security council session which is ongoing. The British parliament was recalled for a meeting Friday to discuss participating in air strikes against Isis militants in Iraq (but not Syria). Earlier Wednesday, Obama vowed to defeat Isis in a speech before the general assembly, calling on the world to \u201cjoin the effort\u201d to \u201cdismantle this network of death.\u201d Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi met with Obama and asked for weapons, saying the Iraqi army had lost many of its weapons to Isis. Around 200 Iraqi soldiers were said to be trapped by Isis fighters in an army camp south of Ramadi in western Iraq. Isis militants killed at least 19 members of a Shia militia in an ambush attack outside Baghdad, Iraqi police said. An Algerian group claiming ties to Isis beheaded a French hostage, a tourist who was captured Sunday. Read the previous blog summary. As the UN security council meeting continues, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is condemning US sanctions on Iran in an address sponsored by the New America Foundation: The US Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed sanctions on eight people it says have helped finance or facilitated the movement of foreign fighters joining the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, the Associated Press reports: Those are two Syrian extremist groups that have been the subject of recent American military strikes. The individuals were designated global terrorists, an action that cuts them off from the U.S. banking system and freezes any assets that may have in the U.S. The department also sanctioned three individuals and a charity accused of supporting a southeast Asian al-Qaida affiliate (Jemaah Islamiya) that is accused of bombing a Bali nightclub in 2002, killing more than 200. A White House pool report notes that Resolution 2178 passed the security council unanimously. For the authoritative account of how the resolution evolved \u2013 and how the United States decided to use the opportunity of Obama\u2019s chairing the security council to focus on the foreign fighters question \u2013 read Hayes Brown at Think Progress, How Obama Decided To Make Terrorist Recruitment His U.N. Priority US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power says there are more than 100 co-sponsors of UN Resolution 2178. Obama describes one threat from foreign fighters: \u201cTerrorists crossing borders and unleashing terrible violence.\u201d Obama returns to his role as chair of the meeting, having just spoken as president of the United States. Obama: The historic resolution we just adopted enshrines our commitment to meet this challenge. It is legally binding. It establishes new obligations that nations must meet. Specifically, nations are required to prevent and suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting or equipping of foreign terrorist fighters, as well as the financing of their travel or activities. Nations must prevent the movement of terrorists or terrorist groups through their territory, and ensure that domestic laws allow for the prosecution of those who attempt to do so. The resolution... calls upon nations to help build the capacity of states on the front lines of this fight, including with the best practices that many of our nations have approved yesterday... This resolution will strengthen cooperation between nations, including sharing more information about the travel and activities of foreign terrorist fighters. And it makes clear that respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law is not optional, it is an essential part of successful counter-terrorism efforts. Finally this resolution recognizes that there is no military solution to the problem of misguided individuals seeking to join terrorist organizations. The US ambassador to the UN says the \u201copening business\u201d included passage of a resolution setting new global rules to crack down on the flow of foreign fighters to conflict zones. \u201cI welcome the council resolution just adopted,\u201d Ban says. Resolution 2718 includes an unprecedented series of travel bans on so-called foreign fighters. The Guardian\u2019s Dan Roberts reports: The need to prevent a Russian veto of the travel ban has also led to it being very loosely drafted \u2013 potentially designated as terrorist anyone travelling to a conflict zone \u2013 something that may alarm more liberal-minded members of the security council. Ban calls \u201cgroups like Isil or Daesh\u201d the enemies of faith. \u201cThey should more fittingly be called the Un-Islamic Non-State,\u201d he says. Obama dispatches with some opening business and turns the floor over to UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. Ban thanks Obama: \u201cThis is the second time that you have presided over this council\u201d at a grave time. Obama is chairing the security council meeting. Here\u2019s a live stream: A 19-year-old from Brighton is believed to be among those killed in Syria in the past 48 hours, the Guardian has learned: Two western fighters in Syria said Khalil al-Britani, whose real name is understood to be Ibrahim Kamara, died after a US air strike on Aleppo. Kamara was described as being a member of Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate group of al-Qaida which has fought against both the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and Islamic State militants in the country\u2019s civil war. A picture posted on Facebook on Tuesday night appears to show Kamara\u2019s face in an unzipped body bag covered in fine sand. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify whether Kamara was killed by a US air strike. [...] His mother, Khadijah Kamara, 35, who lives in Brighton, told the Guardian that she felt numb and confused when she was told on Tuesday that her son was dead. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing. I don\u2019t know what I felt or how I am feeling.\u201d Read the full piece here. After the general assembly this morning and his meeting with the Iraqi prime minister, it\u2019s lunchtime for US President Barack Obama, according to a White House pool report: Obama is having lunch with leaders in the delegates room, a long hall lined with flags on one end and tapestries on the other. [...] Obama rose and cracked a joke about the terrible traffic in New York during the UN general assembly. As someone who lived in New York, he knows first hand \u201cIt is no fun.\u201d In 2008, when he was a senator with Secret Service protection, he even got stuck in the congestion. \u201cI still couldn\u2019t get through the traffic and had to walk three blocks.\u201d A note about the president\u2019s speech this morning: A White House official said Obama wrote most of the address, with an assist from Ben Rhodes. The official said the president had included the Ferguson section to acknowledge, in a speech with sharp criticism of divisions in other nations, \u201cthat we\u2019re not perfect.\u201d The Pentagon said earlier Wednesday that one airstrike had \u201cdamaged eight ISIL vehicles in Syria northwest of Al Qa\u2019im.\u201d Earlier we published one picture believed to be of the strike. Here are others: Barack Obama has called for a meeting of regional powerbrokers in the Middle East to negotiate a broader political solution to current instability, in a potential glimpse into longer term US strategy for resolving the civil wars in Syria and Iraq, Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@RobertsDan) reports: Speaking before the United Nations general assembly, the president said it was \u201ctime for a broader negotiation in which major powers address their differences directly, honestly, and peacefully across the table from one another, rather than through gun-wielding proxies\u201d. Pressure is growing in Washington for Obama to explain how recent US strikes against Islamic extremists in Syria and Iraq will bring about a more lasting political settlement and his comments may indicate an eventual willingness to negotiate with Shia leaders in Iran over their involvement in both countries. In thinly-veiled criticism of Gulf states who the US believes allow funds to flow to Islamic extremists and hardline religious schools across the Middle East, the president said there would be no lasting peace until such radicalism was checked at its root. \u201cIt is time for a new compact among the civilised peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source: the corruption of young minds by violent ideology,\u201d said Obama. Read the full piece here. The White House has issued a transcript of statements by US President Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi following their bilateral meeting at the UN today. Abadi said in part that he has asked Obama for weapons and had \u201cemphasized the importance of the respect of the sovereignty of Iraq and the territorial integrity of Iraq\u201d. Abadi\u2019s comment includes the admission that the Iraqi military lost a lot of weapons to Isis, Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@RobertsDan) points out. Here\u2019s a snippet of Abadi: In my discussion with President Obama, I emphasized the importance of the respect of the sovereignty of Iraq and the territorial integrity of Iraq. And as a Prime Minister of Iraq, I reaffirmed the importance for all forces that want to help Iraq to respect the sovereignty of Iraq and its territorial integrity. I am very thankful for President Obama and all the allies, all who are helping, for maintaining and respecting the territorial integrity of Iraq and its sovereignty. Finally, one of the requests that I have put forth for President Obama is the importance of equipping and arming the Iraqi army and to provide the Iraqi armed forces with weapons. As you know, our armed forces are in dire need for equipment and for weapons, mostly because we lost a lot of the equipment and the weapons in our confrontation and our fight against ISIL, and specifically when the ISIL groups came through the borders from Syria, many of the weapons were destroyed. Some of the weapons fell in the hand of ISIL. Therefore, I am very thankful for President Obama that he promised that weapons and supplies would be delivered to Iraq as soon as possible so Iraq can defeat ISIL and Iraq can overcome this crisis. The Dutch government says it will send six F-16 fighter jets to strike at the Islamic State extremist group in Iraq, the Associated Press reports: Deputy Prime Lodewijk Asscher said Wednesday the Cabinet will deploy the six planes and two reserve jets along with 250 pilots and support staff. The Dutch also will send about 130 military trainers to Iraq to support Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Asscher said the Dutch government doesn\u2019t currently see an international mandate for joining airstrikes in Syria. Defense Minister Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said the Dutch jets will likely be based in Jordan. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has confirmed the killing of Herv\u00e9 Gourdel in Algeria and said the act strengthened his determination to \u201cfight terrorists everywhere\u201d: \u201cOur compatriot has been murdered cruelly and in a cowardly way by a terrorist group,\u201d Hollande told reporters ahead of his speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York. \u201cHerv\u00e9 Gourdel was killed because he was French.\u201d \u201cMy determination is total and this aggression only strengthens it,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance will continue to fight terrorists everywhere. The operations against Islamic State will continue. The military air strikes will continue as long as necessary.\u201d Further Hollande remarks via AP: \u201cI am speaking to you with a particularly high level of emotion,\u201d Hollande said. \u201cThis particular group ... they don\u2019t strike only those who don\u2019t think like they do, they also strike Muslims ... they rape, they kill,\u201d Hollande added. \u201cIt is for this reason that the fight the international community needs to wage versus terrorism knows no borders.\u201d Guardian political editor Patrick Wintour (@patrickwintour) has filed a lengthier take on the news of parliament\u2019s recall. British aircraft could see action as early as this weekend, he reports: Parliament is to be recalled on Friday to endorse British air strikes in Iraq following assurances from the leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband, to the prime minister, David Cameron, that his party will support UK involvement in the country. Britain is likely to send RAF Tornado aircraft into action, possibly as early as this weekend, once MPs have voted. [...] Parliament will not debate any UK action in Syria at this stage, after Labour indicated it would not support UK involvement there without a UN resolution to authorise action in a country where military help to fight Isis has not been requested. At the close of the Labour party conference in Manchester, Miliband convened an emergency meeting of the shadow cabinet to endorse military action in Iraq so providing Cameron the assurance he needed that he would win the Commons vote.[...] Read the full piece here. Around 200 Iraqi soldiers were trapped in an army camp in western Iraq on Wednesday, Reuters reports, besieged by Islamic State militants who routed hapless army forces in a raid on a base close to Baghdad at the weekend: A soldier cornered in the camp said food, weapons and ammunition were running short, with forces sent to rescue them struggling to clear a route. \u201cThere are troops behind us but they can\u2019t reach us because the whole area is planted with roadside bombs and land mines,\u201d said Hussein Thamir, a soldier who spoke to Reuters from inside the Albu Etha camp, about 10 km south of the city of Ramadi. \u201cThere was an army group in front of us whom (Islamic State) destroyed completely six days ago,\u201d said Thamir. \u201cIf we withdraw, will be killed.\u201d Using similar tactics, Islamic State insurgents on Sunday overran an army base in Saqlawiya, just 50 km (30 miles) west of Baghdad, killing or capturing between 400 to 600 soldiers, a senior Iraqi security official said. The heavy losses revealed once again the parlous state of the Iraqi army, which is riven by endemic corruption and low morale, and which crumpled this summer as Islamic State took control of roughly a third of the country.

Britian\u2019s parliament is to be recalled on Friday to endorse air strikes in Iraq as early as this weekend, \u201cfollowing assurances from Labour party leader Ed Miliband to Prime Minister David Cameron that he will support UK involvement in the country,\u201d writes Guardian political editor Patrick Wintour (@patrickwintour). \u201cBritain is likely to send RAF Tomahawk aircraft into action.\u201d In a short statement, a spokesman for Cameron said: \u201cThe Speaker has agreed to the Prime Minister\u2019s request to recall Parliament this Friday to debate the UK\u2019s response to the request from the Iraqi Government for air strikes to support operations against ISIL in Iraq. \u201cThe Commons will meet on Friday for a debate on a substantive motion. The Prime Minister will open the debate and the Deputy Prime Minister will close the debate. The Prime Minister has called a meeting of the Cabinet tomorrow at 1pm.\u201d Patrick adds: At the close of the Labour party conference in Manchester, Miliband had convened an emergency meeting of Labour\u2019s cabinet to endorse military action in Iraq so providing Cameron the assurance he needed that he will win the vote in parliament. The path was also cleared after Cameron met Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi in New York to receive a formal request for military action, so clearing a vital legal hurdle to UK involvement. The Iraqi government has requested that Britain carry out air strikes against Isis militants, the Press Association quotes Cameron as saying. The speaker has accepted Cameron\u2019s request; parliament has been recalled. Cameron asks MPs to convene on Friday. The Press Association in London reports that prime minister David Cameron has requested the recall of parliament to debate the UK\u2019s response to the Iraqi government\u2019s request for support against Islamic State militants. A Kurdish organization has accused the Turkish government of backing Islamic State militants fighting against Kurdish forces in Syria, AP reports: The statement was issued Wednesday by the Kurdish Communities Union, whose honorary leader is Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, the Kurdish rebel group that has long fought Turkey for autonomy. The umbrella group accused Turkey of \u201cwaging a war against the Kurdish people\u201d and vowed to step up its \u201cstruggle.\u201d It accused Turkey of supporting Islamic State group battling Syrian Kurdish forces along the Syria-Turkish border, and of stalling the peace process that it launched two years ago with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party that led to the cease-fire in Turkey. In New York on Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan promised support for the US strikes against Isis militants in Syria. Isis militants killed 19 Shia militiamen in an ambush north of Baghdad on Wednesday, officials said, the Associated Press reports: Police officials said fighters from the Islamic State extremist group hiding in orchards opened fire with machine-guns on a convoy of Shiite militiamen travelling on a road in Babilan village. They said 39 other people were wounded in the attack. Babilan is about 90 kilometers (60 miles) north of Baghdad. In other violence, police said three separate bombings in commercial areas of the capital killed seven people and wounded dozens of others. Read the full report here. The Pentagon on Wednesday said it was still investigating whether US strikes in Syria on Tuesday killed a leader of the al Qaeda-linked Khorasan group, adding that it could take time to determine, Reuters reports: \u201cWe just don\u2019t have a confirmation to make at this point,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren. \u201cWe don\u2019t have personnel on the ground to verify, so we\u2019re continuing to assess.\u201d Reuters quoted a U.S. official earlier on Wednesday saying the United States believed one of those killed in the strike against the group was Mohsin al-Fadhli, who the U.S. government has identified as a al Qaeda financier close to al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. Saudi pilots who conducted air strikes on jihadis in Syria have received online death threats after photos were published of those involved, among them a son of the crown prince, AFP reports: Saudi Press Agency (SPA) released photographs of eight airmen it said were involved in Tuesday\u2019s US-led operation, carried out with Gulf allies. In one picture they stood, some smiling, in green flight suits with arms around each other in front of one of their fighter jets. One of the pilots involved in the raids is a son of Crown Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz, according to Saudi newspapers. Read the full report here. As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: In an address before the UN general assembly, President Barack Obama called on the world to help defeat Isis and what he called its \u201cnetwork of death\u201d in Iraq and Syria. Obama said the only language the extremists understood was one of force and that the United States would fight until they were defeated. Obama\u2019s speech included sharp criticism of Russia, which he accused of violating Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and promoting \u201cmight makes right.\u201d \u201cAmerica stands for something different,\u201d Obama claimed. \u201cWe believe that right makes might.\u201d Read Julian Borger\u2019s report on Obama\u2019s UN speech, \u201cObama vows to defeat Isis and rallies world\u2019s nations to \u2018join in this effort\u2019\u201d The Pentagon described five new air strikes against Isis in Syria. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a second day and there\u2019ll be a third and a fourth\u201d in Syria, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN. It appeared that UK prime minister David Cameron might request a recall of parliament Friday for a vote on Britain joining the war effort. Labor was meeting to discuss the move. An Algerian group claiming ties to Isis beheaded a French hostage, a tourist who was captured Sunday. The family of British hostage Alan Henning has expressed concern that air strikes in Syria would complicate the effort to win his release. Read the previous blog summary Algerian jihadis linked to Isis militants in Iraq and Syria have beheaded a French tourist they have been holding since the weekend, Kim Willsher (@kimwillsher1) reports from Paris: The group calling itself Jund al-Khilafah \u2013 or Soldiers of the Caliphate \u2013 released a video showing the beheading of mountain guide Herv\u00e9 Gourdel, according to the US terrorism watchdog, Site. The video was entitled Message in Blood for the French Government. Gourdel, 55, from Nice, was abducted on Sunday while on holiday in Algeria. The kidnappers had threatened to kill him within 48 hours unless France halted air strikes on Isis territory. Read the full report here. The family of Alan Henning, the British aid worker currently held by Isis militants, fears that US-led air strikes in Syria will damage the cause of securing Henning\u2019s safe return. \u201cThey\u2019ll just run away and take him with them, and no one will know where he is again,\u201d said brother-in-law Colin Livesey. \u201cThey might have a fair idea of where he is right now.\u201d Read more about Henning here. The Guardian\u2019s Constanze Letsch (@constanzeletsch) has visited the Turkish border town of Ak\u00e7akale, which sits meters from the Syrian town of Tel Abyad, now occupied by Isis. \u201cAt least they are quiet,\u201d [a resident] says. \u201cThe FSA used to shoot in the air all the time. These guys don\u2019t make a racket all the time. These are small mercies. But we are worried about the bombing by the Americans. When has that ever done any good?\u201d Constanze has filed this portrait of the mood in the town, including robust disapproval for US air strikes: Abdullatif Ismail, 50, used to work with the Syrian secret police in Raqqa, but says he defected when the government openly started killing people. He came to Turkey a year and nine months ago. His wife and two daughters live with him in a rental flat in Ak\u00e7akale; he works as a volunteer teacher in a refugee school nearby. His son works in Saudi Arabia; his mother and extended family have stayed in Raqqa. Every day they exchange news using the WhatsApp message service . \u201cI heard about the air strikes in Raqqa,\u201d he says. \u201cAir strikes are not a very precise method. Raqqa is a big city, many people live there who are not Isis.\u201d Here is further detail on the threats against German hostages in the Philippines (see earlier report here). \u201cIslamists in the Philippines have threatened to kill two German hostages unless Germany pays a ransom and withdraws its support for the US fight against Isis in Syria and northern Iraq,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann (@philipoltermann) writes from Berlin: In a message circulated via Twitter, the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group announced it would \u201ckill one of the hostages\u201d unless its demands were met within 15 days, according to US company Site Intelligence Group, which tracks communications from radical Islamist groups. The message calls on Germany to \u201cstop supporting America in its killing of our Muslim brothers in Iraq and Syria, especially the mujahideen of the Islamic State\u201d. The German pair, 71-year-old Stefan O and 55-year-old Henrike D, were reported missing in April, after their yacht was found empty in the Palavan province in the western Philippines.

Guardian diplomatic editor Julian Borger (@julianborger) has written a background piece with some of the history and highlights of the UN general assembly, in which more than 140 world leaders converge on the UN headquarters at Turtle Bay in midtown Manhattan to discuss some of the many urgent matters of the day: Each head of state or government will have 15 minutes to say what is on his or her mind at the assembly\u2019s famous green marble podium. It is a restriction often abused, though seldom as much as by Muammar Gaddafi in 2009 when he spoke for more than 90 minutes. For colorful details of life inside the UN chamber, including the factoid that \u201cSmoking is now prohibited in the chamber and the ashtrays have been removed from the delegates\u2019 desks, one of the first changes to the 1940s design,\u201d read the full piece here. And check out this video of the UN general assembly\u2019s greatest hits: Cameron and Rouhani meet. The Guardian\u2019s Saeed Kamali Dehghan has filed a report exploring the tricky balance Rouhani must strike while in New York to avoid offending potential critics on all sides: Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, has to weigh up every step he takes as he visits the UN in New York, accommodating world leaders while not upsetting hardliners at home. Wednesday\u2019s meeting with the British prime minister, David Cameron, the first such encounter in decades, just adds to the complications. In Tehran, domestic repercussions of any potential statements he will make or meetings he will attend, can be costly. Hawks and fundamentalists, such as those in the Iranian parliament, will be circling like vultures to watch him slip. Last year in New York, the 65-year-old made a difficult choice and despite his own willingness decided not to commit to a historic handshake in the corridors of the UN headquarters with the US president, Barack Obama. Read the full piece here. Guardian political editor Patrick Wintour (@patrickwintour) reports that the shadow cabinet was meeting in an unexpected emergency session in Manchester, where the opposition Labour party is having its annual conference, to discuss whether to support air strikes in Iraq \u201cin light of notification from Downing Street that it would like to recall parliament later this week\u201d: The recall will not go ahead unless and until Labour makes clear it will support air strikes in Iraq. Labour has said it supports the air strikes undertake in Syria by America so far, but it has called for a UN Security Council resolution before strikes inside Syria. Shadow Cabinet sources said the meeting is likely to focus on whether to support air strikes in Syria at this stage given the doubts about its legality, and the absence of a viable ground force inside Syria that can combat IS, but does not lead to a strengthening of President Assad. \u201cIf the shadow cabinet agrees to support UK involvement in the air strikes in Iraq, David Cameron will seek a recall of parliament,\u201d Patrick writes. \u201cNormally 48 hours is required for parliament to be recalled, but these rules can be waived.\u201d You can read our further coverage of the question of whether parliament will be recalled here. Next for Obama: a meeting with the Iraqi prime minister, whose governments was one of the purported world bright spots singled out by the American leader: Yet, we also see signs that this tide could be reversed \u2013 a new, inclusive government in Baghdad; a new Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed by his neighbors; Lebanese factions rejecting those who try to provoke war. These steps must be followed by a broader truce. Some reactions from our correspondents: As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of Obama\u2019s speech: The president made a moral appeal to the world to join the fight against Isis militants and terrorism in general. Obama said \u201cviolent extremism\u201d in the \u201cMuslim world\u201d was \u201cone issue [that] risks a cycle of conflict that could derail\u201d world progress. Obama delivered this jeremiad against Isis: \u201cNo God condones this terror. No grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning \u2013 no negotiation \u2013 with this brand of evil. The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.\u201d Obama expressed sharp criticism of Russia, accusing Moscow of promoting \u201ca vision of the world in which might makes right \u2013 a world in which one nation\u2019s borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed.\u201d Obama said Iran had an \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d to cut a nuclear deal: \u201cMy message to Iran\u2019s leaders and people is simple: do not let this opportunity pass.\u201d Obama referred to the killing of Michael Brown: \u201cI know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri \u2013 where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions.\u201d Read the previous blog summary. The speech ran about a half hour. Obama concludes by saying \u201cat this crossroads, I can promise you that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done.\u201d He calls on the United Nations to \u201cjoin us in this common mission, for today\u2019s children and tomorrow\u2019s.\u201d That\u2019s it. Applause. The US president glides into his peroration: After nearly six years as President, I believe that this promise can help light the world. Because I\u2019ve seen a longing for positive change \u2013 for peace and freedom and opportunity \u2013 in the eyes of young people I\u2019ve met around the globe. They remind me that no matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like, or what God you pray to, or who you love, there is something fundamental that we all share. Eleanor Roosevelt, a champion of the UN and America\u2019s role in it, once asked, \u201cWhere, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places,\u201d she said, \u201cclose to home \u2013 so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm or office where he works.\u201d Obama says America is not above criticism. His example is Ferguson. \u201cWe welcome the scrutiny of the world,\u201d he says: I realize that America\u2019s critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals; that America has plenty of problems within our own borders. This is true. In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri \u2013 where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions. And like every country, we continually wrestle with how to reconcile the vast changes wrought by globalization and greater diversity with the traditions that we hold dear. But we welcome the scrutiny of the world \u2013 because what you see in America is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems and make our union more perfect. Obama says \u201cthe status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not sustainable\u201d and refers to the \u201clives of so many Palestinian children\u201d taken: We cannot afford to turn away from this effort \u2013 not when rockets are fired at innocent Israelis, or the lives of so many Palestinian children are taken from us in Gaza. So long as I am President, we will stand up for the principle that Israelis, Palestinians, the region, and the world will be more just with two states living side by side, in peace and security. Obama seeks in the next section of his speech to speak directly to the youth of the Arab and Muslim world. \u201cYou come from a great tradition,\u201d he says: My fourth and final point is a simple one: the countries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on the extraordinary potential of their people \u2013 especially the youth. Here I\u2019d like to speak directly to young people across the Muslim world. You come from a great tradition that stands for education, not ignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of life, not murder. Those who call you away from this path are betraying this tradition, not defending it. You have demonstrated that when young people have the tools to succeed \u2013good schools; education in math and science; an economy that nurtures creativity and entrepreneurship \u2013 then societies will flourish. So America will partner with those who promote that vision. Obama moves into the third of \u201cfour areas of focus\u201d he recommended for the international community. He says of the Sunni-Shia conflict, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: this is a fight that no one is winning\u201d. He also refers to the \u201cbrutal civil war in Syria\u201d: Third, we must address the cycle of conflict \u2013 especially sectarian conflict \u2013 that creates the conditions that terrorists prey upon. There is nothing new about wars within religions. Christianity endured centuries of vicious sectarian conflict. Today, it is violence within Muslim communities that has become the source of so much human misery. It is time to acknowledge the destruction wrought by proxy wars and terror campaigns between Sunni and Shia across the Middle East. And it is time that political, civic and religious leaders reject sectarian strife. Let\u2019s be clear: this is a fight that no one is winning. A brutal civil war in Syria has already killed nearly 200,000 people and displaced millions. Iraq has come perilously close to plunging back into the abyss. The conflict has created a fertile recruiting ground for terrorists who inevitably export this violence. In the next section of Obama\u2019s speech, he says \u201cit is time for the world \u2013 especially Muslim communities \u2013 to explicitly, forcefully, and consistently reject the ideology of al Qaeda and ISIL.\u201d \u201cThere should be no more tolerance of so-called clerics who call upon people to harm innocents because they are Jewish, Christian or Muslim,\u201d Obama says. \u201c...The ideology of ISIL or al Qaeda or Boko Haram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed, confronted, and refuted in the light of day.\u201d The US president warns Isis conscripts to get out before it\u2019s too late: In this effort, we do not act alone. Nor do we intend to send U.S. troops to occupy foreign lands. Instead, we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities. We will use our military might in a campaign of air strikes to roll back ISIL. We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground. We will work to cut off their financing, and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region. Already, over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition. Today, I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone. For we will not succumb to threats; and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build \u2013 not those who destroy. Obama says \u201cThe only language understood by killers like this is the language of force\u201d: As an international community, we must meet this challenge with a focus on four areas. First, the terrorist group known as ISIL must be degraded, and ultimately destroyed. This group has terrorized all who they come across in Iraq and Syria. Mothers, sisters and daughters have been subjected to rape as a weapon of war. Innocent children have been gunned down. Bodies have been dumped in mass graves. Religious minorities have been starved to death. In the most horrific crimes imaginable, innocent human beings have been beheaded, with videos of the atrocity distributed to shock the conscience of the world. No God condones this terror. No grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning \u2013 no negotiation \u2013 with this brand of evil. The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death. Obama\u2019s speech strives for a moral tenor. \u201c Belief in permanent religious war is the misguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or create anything,\u201d he says: So we reject any suggestion of a clash of civilizations. Belief in permanent religious war is the misguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or create anything, and therefore peddle only fanaticism and hate. And it is no exaggeration to say that humanity\u2019s future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along fault lines of tribe or sect; race or religion. This is not simply a matter of words. Obama turns to the threat posed by Isis: ...as we look to the future, one issue risks a cycle of conflict that could derail such progress: and that is the cancer of violent extremism that has ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world. Of course, terrorism is not new. Speaking before this Assembly, President Kennedy put it well: \u201cTerror is not a new weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout history it has been used by those who could not prevail, either by persuasion or example.\u201d In the 20th century, terror was used by all manner of groups who failed to come to power through public support. But in this century, we have faced a more lethal and ideological brand of terrorists who have perverted one of the world\u2019s great religions. With access to technology that allows small groups to do great harm, they have embraced a nightmarish vision that would divide the world into adherents and infidels \u2013 killing as many innocent civilians as possible; and employing the most brutal methods to intimidate people within their communities. I have made it clear that America will not base our entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism. Rather, we have waged a focused campaign against al Qaeda and its associated forces \u2013 taking out their leaders, and denying them the safe-havens they rely upon. At the same time, we have reaffirmed that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam. Islam teaches peace. Muslims the world over aspire to live with dignity and a sense of justice. And when it comes to America and Islam, there is no us and them \u2013 there is only us, because millions of Muslim Americans are part of the fabric of our country. Obama says the US will fight Ebola, and will work to address climate change. He also calls on Iran to take an \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d: America is pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue, as part of our commitment to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace and security of a world without them. This can only happen if Iran takes this historic opportunity. My message to Iran\u2019s leaders and people is simple: do not let this opportunity pass. We can reach a solution that meets your energy needs while assuring the world that your program is peaceful. The US president says the United States will continue to support \u201cthe people of Ukraine\u201d and heralds \u201cthe recent ceasefire agreement in the Ukraine.\u201d There are a few lines with some rhetorical snap in this section: \u201cwhile small gains can be won at the barrel of a gun, they will ultimately be turned back if enough voices support the freedom of nations and peoples to make their own decision.\u201d Obama makes a strong statement of condemnation of Russia, accusing Moscow of promoting \u201ca vision of the world in which might makes right\u201d: Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine challenge this post-war order. Here are the facts. After the people of Ukraine mobilized popular protests and calls for reform, their corrupt President fled. Against the will of the government in Kiev, Crimea was annexed. Russia poured arms into Eastern Ukraine, fueling violent separatists and a conflict that has killed thousands. When a civilian airliner was shot down from areas that these proxies controlled, they refused to allow access to the crash for days. When Ukraine started to reassert control over its territory, Russia gave up the pretense of merely supporting the separatists, and moved troops across the border. This is a vision of the world in which might makes right \u2013 a world in which one nation\u2019s borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed. America stands for something different. We believe that right makes might \u2013 that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones; that people should be able to choose their own future. The president says the \u201cinternational system\u201d is at a crossroads and nations much take up \u201ccollective responsibility or \u201cbe swamped\u201d by instability: Fellow delegates, we come together as United Nations with a choice to make. We can renew the international system that has enabled so much progress, or allow ourselves to be pulled back by an undertow of instability. We can reaffirm our collective responsibility to confront global problems, or be swamped by more and more outbreaks of instability. For America, the choice is clear. We choose hope over fear. We see the future not as something out of our control, but as something we can shape for the better through concerted and collective effort. We reject fatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs; we choose to work for the world as it should be, as our children deserve it to be. Obama lays out \u201ctwo defining questions\u201d: There is much that must be done to meet the tests of this moment. But today I\u2019d like to focus on two defining questions at the root of many of our challenges\u2013 whether the nations here today will be able to renew the purpose of the UN\u2019s founding; and whether we will come together to reject the cancer of violent extremism. Obama pivots from points for global optimism to points of challenge. He mentions Ebola, Ukraine, Syria and Iraq: And yet there is a pervasive unease in our world \u2013 a sense that the very forces that have brought us together have created new dangers, and made it difficult for any single nation to insulate itself from global forces. As we gather here, an outbreak of Ebola overwhelms public health systems in West Africa, and threatens to move rapidly across borders. Russian aggression in Europe recalls the days when large nations trampled small ones in pursuit of territorial ambition. The brutality of terrorists in Syria and Iraq forces us to look into the heart of darkness. Each of these problems demands urgent attention. But they are also symptoms of a broader problem \u2013 the failure of our international system to keep pace with an interconnected world. We have not invested adequately in the public health capacity of developing countries. Too often, we have failed to enforce international norms when it\u2019s inconvenient to do so. And we have not confronted forcefully enough the intolerance, sectarianism, and hopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many parts of the globe. The text of Obama\u2019s speech has been released by the White House. Here is his introduction. He begins by heralding a strengthening of the UN, of the world economy and the global community. He refers to \u201cmy grandmother\u2019s village more than two hundred miles from Nairobi\u201d: Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen: we come together at a crossroads between war and peace; between disorder and integration; between fear and hope. Around the globe, there are signposts of progress. The shadow of World War that existed at the founding of this institution has been lifted; the prospect of war between major powers reduced. The ranks of member states has more than tripled, and more people live under governments they elected. Hundreds of millions of human beings have been freed from the prison of poverty, with the proportion of those living in extreme poverty cut in half. And the world economy continues to strengthen after the worst financial crisis of our lives. Today, whether you live in downtown New York or in my grandmother\u2019s village more than two hundred miles from Nairobi, you can hold in your hand more information than the world\u2019s greatest libraries. Together, we have learned how to cure disease, and harness the power of the wind and sun. The very existence of this institution is a unique achievement \u2013 the people of the world committing to resolve their differences peacefully, and solve their problems together. I often tell young people in the United States that this is the best time in human history to be born, for you are more likely than ever before to be literate, to be healthy, and to be free to pursue your dreams. Obama is introduced in the chamber. The hall claps. He begins speaking. \u201cWe come together at a crossroads between war and peace,\u201d he says. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is currently addressing the general assembly. They\u2019re not playing her on the White House YouTube channel but you can watch on UN web TV here. She is talking about \u201cprivacy in the digital age.\u201d US President Barack Obama is anticipated at any moment at the UN lectern. To appreciate the legal hole the United States is trying to thread with its strikes in Syria, taken without UN approval, read Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts\u2019 piece, \u201cUS ties itself in legal knots to cover shifting rationale for Syria strikes\u201d: US government lawyers have invoked Iraq\u2019s right to self-defence and the weakness of the Assad regime as twin justifications for US bombing in Syria, in a feat of legal acrobatics that may reopen questions over its right to intervene in the bitter civil war. In a letter to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, released near 24 hours after attacks began, US ambassador Samantha Power argued that the threat to Iraq from Islamic State, known as Isis or Isil, gave the US and its allies in the region an automatic right to attack on its behalf. \u201cIraq has made clear that it is facing a serious threat of continuing attacks from Isil coming out of safe havens in Syria,\u201d Power wrote. \u201cThe government of Iraq has asked that the United States lead international efforts to strike Isil sites and military strongholds in Syria in order to end the continuing attacks on Iraq, to protect Iraqi citizens and ultimately to enable and arm Iraqi forces to perform their task of regaining control of the Iraqi borders.\u201d The brief letter did not mention the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, which rested on erroneous claims of weapons of mass destruction and arguably contributed to its current instability, but stresses instead the country\u2019s right to self-defence in the face of this new threat. Read the full piece here. As we wait for Obama, here is video of Cameron from his NBC News interview saying that Britain cannot opt out of the fight against Isis: The Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington (@edpilkington) is at the United Nations, where President Barack Obama is scheduled to address the general assembly in about 10 minutes. Ed\u2019s coverage begins with a snapshot from a hidden corner. \u201cHeads of state from around the world are pouring into the UN headquarters in New York this morning,\u201d he writes: If they were hoping for a moment\u2019s quiet reflection before they enter the mayhem of the general assembly chamber they would have been disappointed: even the restrooms have been turned into globalised megaphones. Fresh rolls of lavatory paper have been loaded especially for the occasion stamped with the words: \u201cOpen defecation\u201d. If that\u2019s not alarming enough, the next sheet of paper ensures a pleasant, lyrical start to the day with the words: \u201cA child dies every 2.5 minutes from diarrhoeal diseases\u201d and \u201c1 billion people globally do not have any access to a toilet\u201d. The White House will stream the president\u2019s address to the general assembly on its YouTube channel: Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@RobertsDan) contributes this analysis of Obama\u2019s appearance this morning at the United Nations. The president \u201ctakes the stage at the United Nations general assembly on Wednesday morning with twin tasks,\u201d Dan writes: [The twin tasks are] to justify and explain US-led military strikes in Syria that were carried out without UN approval, and to seek its authority for an unprecedented series of travel bans on so-called foreign fighters. Just as in Washington, the president has ducked the trickier task of winning a resolution for war in favour of a more palatable vote to contain the Islamic State through indirect means. Nevertheless there is a similar risk of contamination between the two strategies if countries on the UN Security Council \u2013 which Obama chairs in a special session this afternoon \u2013 decide to take out their frustration at lack of consultation over bombing by obstructing a vote on the travel ban. The need to prevent a Russian veto of the travel ban has also led to it being very loosely drafted \u2013 potentially designated as terrorist anyone travelling to a conflict zone \u2013 something that may alarm more liberal-minded members of the security council. Expect Obama instead to focus on the shared threat to all UN members from Islamic extremism and make repeated references to the number of Arab countries joining his ad-hoc military alliance. Within the next hour Barack Obama will address the UN general assembly session on Isis. The meeting is aimed at cutting off the flow of money and manpower to the Islamic State (Isis). This afternoon, Obama will chair a meeting of the 10-member security council. Doing so describes a sharp contrast with his predecessor, George W. Bush, diplomatic editor Julian Borger writes: By bringing other world leaders to the famous circular arena, Obama seeks to dramatise the urgency of the issue at hand, the threat of the spread in the Middle East of a new extremist group, Islamic State (Isis). The US president is signalling his respect for UN institutions and an emphasis on forging a collective approach to the world\u2019s problems. He is the only American leader to have convened such a meeting, and will now have done it twice. The first time was five years ago when the issue at hand was another global concern at the top of Obama\u2019s agenda: nuclear proliferation. The message is clear: he is nothing like his predecessor, George Bush, whose disdain for multilateralism and decision to lead the 2003 invasion of Iraq without a UN mandate, left deep rifts in the security council and in the wider world. Yet, however hard Obama seeks to be the antithesis of Bush, the ghost of the Iraq war will hang over Wednesday\u2019s proceedings. The president will arrive having just authorised the extension of the US-led air campaign against Isis in Syria, the legality of which is hotly contested. Here\u2019s a summary of the main events today: Syria has urged Britain and the west to coordinate attacks on Islamic State militants with Damascus. In an interview with BBC News, Bassam Abu Abdullah, from Syria\u2019s information ministry, said: \u201cWe are facing the same enemy\u201d. The Pentagon has released details of more air strikes on Isis positions in Iraq and Syria, including confirmation of an attack inside Syria north-west of the Iraqi border town of al-Qa\u2019im. It said 20 air strikes have now been launched in Syria. Isis has reinforced fighters who are battling Kurdish forces for control of the town on Kobani close to the Turkish border. The US has not confirmed reports that Isis positions were hit around after jets were seen flying from Turkish airspace. Turkey has denied that its airspace was used in the attack. A Syrian opposition group affiliated with the \u201cmoderate\u201d Free Syrian Army has condemned the US-led air strikes in a new video. It said they were a conspiracy against the Syrian revolution. Parliament is expected to be recalled on Friday to discuss British air strikes against Isis. MPs have been told to expect an announcement on the recall after the end of the Labour Party conference. Labour leader Ed Miliband has suggested his party would back air strikes in Iraq but not in Syria. \u201cThe situation in Syria is somewhat different\u201d he said pointing out that unlike Iraq, Syria is not asking for intervention. David Cameron said Britain \u201ccannot opt out\u201d of the battle againstIsis, as he is set to hear a formal request from Iraq to launch air strikes against militants. Speaking to NBC the prime minister said: \u201cThese people want to kill us. They\u2019ve got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition ... to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation.\u201d The Iraqi leader Haider al-Abadi is expected to ask Cameron for help in fighting Islamic State at a meeting at the United Nations in New York. Cameron will then travel back to Britain to consult his Cabinet and Labour before making a final decision on any military action, according to the Mirror. Barack Obama claimed the backing of five Arab nations for intensive military attacks against Isis targets in Syria showed the offensive was not \u201cAmerica\u2019s fight alone\u201d. Overnight strikes against Isis took place in concert with five Arab allies \u2013 Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar \u2013 and marked a substantial escalation in the campaign against the militant group also known as Isil. The wife of Alan Henning, the British aid worker kidnapped by Islamic State militants, has made a new plea for his release after being sent an audio recording of her husband. Barbara Henning said that Alan was \u201cpleading for his life\u201d in the recording. A Syrian opposition group affiliated with the \u201cmoderate\u201d Free Syrian Army has condemned the US-led air strikes in a new video, analyst Hassan Hassan point outs. In the video statement says the group says the air strikes are a conspiracy against the Syrian revolution. The video will be an embarrassment to the US which has been working with the FSA on a plan to train Syrian rebels. The $500m programme was approved by Congress last week. Aron Lund, an analyst who specialising in tracking extremist groups in Iraq and Syria, is sceptical of briefings by US officials on the Khorasan group. Writing for Carnegie Endownment, he said Khorsan is not a new group but a specialized cell led by Muhsin al-Fadhli within, or on, the fringes of the existing al-Qaida franchise, the so-called Nusra Front. The sudden flurry of revelations about the \u201cKhorasan Group\u201d in the past two weeks smacks of strategic leaks and political spin. Even if the information provided is entirely correct, which it may well be, the timing can hardly be coincidental\u2014within two weeks of the first press reports, attacks had started against Fadhli and his allies in Syria. Rather, these leaks seem to have been designed to bolster the case for strikes against the Nusra Front, after a public debate that had, until then, focused only on the Islamic State. Interestingly, the strikes also come at a time when U.S. officials must be worried about the Nusra Front\u2019s growing assertiveness in the northwest of Syria, particularly in the border regions of northern Idlib and the western Aleppo countryside. This is an area where the United States and its allies seek to support rival rebel forces, in order to gradually squeeze out the hardline jihadis and reshape the insurgency against Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad. There are many indications that the Nusra Front is in internal disarray, after suffering battlefield and propaganda defeats against the Islamic State for several months. But whether because of or despite this internal unrest, the Nusra Front\u2019s forces in the Idlib and Aleppo region have recently begun to consolidate territorial control and harass rival rebel groups. The balance of power in this corner of Syria may now be shifting, not least after the mysterious September 9 bombing that killed most leaders of Ahrar al-Sham, a powerful independent Salafi group that has worked with both the Nusra Front and with U.S. allies. In particular, Ahrar al-Sham plays a central role in the administration of the strategic Bab al-Hawa border crossing, which is a chokepoint for support to Syria\u2019s rebels, including to pro-US rebel forces. Whether it will be able to retain that role after September 9 is anyone\u2019s guess. The US attacks against Nusra Front facilities in northwestern Syria may have been narrowly focused on Fadhli\u2019s external operations wing, as claimed by the Pentagon, but distinguishing Fadhli\u2019s men from the rest of the Nusra Front/al-Qaida apparatus in Syria must be easier said than done. Then again, if the bombing campaign also happens to weaken the Nusra Front\u2019s hold on territory in Idlib and around the Bab al-Hawa border crossing, so much the better for US strategy. The Pentagon has released details of more news air strikes on Isis positions in Iraq and Syria, including confirmation of an attack inside Syria north-west of the Iraqi border town of al-Qa\u2019im. Central Command said five strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday involved bomber and fighter aircraft. It said: Two airstrikes west of Baghdad destroyed two ISIL armed vehicles and a weapons cache. Two airstrikes southeast of Irbil destroyed ISIL fighting positions. A fifth airstrike damaged eight ISIL vehicles in Syria northwest of Al Qa\u2019im. All aircraft exited the strike areas safely. The strikes were conducted as part of the President\u2019s comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. To date, U.S. Central Command has conducted 198 airstrikes across Iraq against ISIL. Along with partner nations, U.S. Central Command has also conducted 20 airstrikes across Syria against ISIL. The figure of 20 air strikes in Syria doesn\u2019t tally with a briefing given by an official on Tuesday who said more than 200 air strikes had taken place. There has still been no confirmation of air strikes around Kobani, near the Turkish border. The al-Nusra Front, the al-Qaida linked parent group of Khorasan cell targeted by US air strikes, has evacuated its bases in populated parts of the Idlib countryside in northwest Syria, Reuters reports citing some of its fighters said on Wednesday. Another Syrian Islamist group, Ahrar al-Sham, has also ordered its followers to evacuate bases, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group said. The Observatory confirmed the Nusra withdrawal. The Nusra Front withdrawal was posted on social media accounts linked to the group, notes analyst Charles Lister. The Khorasan group targeted in separate US-only raids west of Aleppo on Tuesday were planning a toothpaste bomb plot against airlines, an unnamed official told AP. Administration officials said Tuesday they have been watching the Khorasan Group, an al-Qaida cell in Syria, for years. But Obama had resisted taking military action in Syria to avoid inadvertently helping President Bashar Assad, a leader the US would like to see gone. That changed, officials said, because intelligence showed that the Khorasan Group was in the final stages of plotting attacks against the US and Europe, most likely an attempt to blow up an airplane in flight. On the same night that US and Arab allies carried out more than 200 airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, the US on its own launched more than 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles and other ordinance against eight Khorasan Group targets near Aleppo in northwestern Syria, Pentagon officials said. It\u2019s not clear yet whether the group\u2019s leader, identified by US officials as Muhsin al-Fadhli, was killed in the strikes. He is a Kuwaiti who spent time in Iran and has long been identified as a significant figure in al-Qaida. But regardless of the impact, the need for such an operation against the Khorasan Group dealt a blow to the notion, oft-repeated by Obama administration officials, that core al-Qaida has been significantly diminished as a threat to the United States. The Islamic State has broken with al-Qaida, and, for all its brutality, is not believed to be plotting attacks against the West. In contrast, the Khorasan Group is a cell of al-Qaida veterans of wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan who travelled to Syria to link up with the Nusra Front, the al-Qaida affiliate there. US intelligence officials say the group has been working with bomb makers from al-Qaida\u2019s Yemen affiliate to perfect explosives that can fool Western airport security measures, including, one official said, a bomb in a toothpaste tube ... Briefing reporters at the Pentagon on Tuesday, Lt. Gen. William Mayville, who directs operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Khorasan Group was nearing \u201cthe execution phase of an attack either in Europe or the (US) homeland.\u201d However, two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss classified assessments, said there was no particular location or target that had come to the attention of US intelligence agencies. In a memo released in February 2013, the Justice Department disclosed that in the view of government lawyers, \u201can \u2018imminent\u2019 threat of violent attack against the United States does not require ... clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.\u201d Another senior intelligence official said the group\u2019s \u201cplotting had reached a more advanced stage.\u201d A radical Islamic preacher who spent four years in a UK jail for soliciting murder and hate speech has pleaded for the life of British hostage Alan Henning in a video released on Wednesday morning, writes Shiv Malik. Abdullah el-Faisal, who is said to have played a part in radicalising the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is one the most radical English-speaking preachers to publicly call for Henning\u2019s release. The one-time Imam of south London\u2019s Brixton mosque, Faisal, who has been a fervent online champion of Islamic State (Isis), even supporting the kidnapping and raping of Yazidi minority women, begged for Henning\u2019s life and said that to kill him would be against Islamic law. There are growing signs that Henning\u2019s kidnapping is controversial even among Islamic extremists who have been sympathetic to Isis\u2019s tactics. Faisal\u2019s intervention is the clearest example of this. With previous kidnappings some Isis supporting scholars have made the case that they could be spies but according to reports Isis\u2019s own sharia court has cleared the aid worker of being a spy. Former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain says attacks on Isis in Syria are illegal without UN backing. Three Labour MPs, Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbot, and John McDonnell signed a letter to the Guardian opposing British involvement in the campaign. It said: More bombing, let alone boots on the ground, will only exacerbate the situation. We urge the government to rule out any further military action in Iraq or Syria. There has been no confirmation from the UAE on reports that its first female pilot, Mariam al Mansouri, took part in the air strikes. UAE jets have been involved on the strikes on Isis in Syria, but there has been no official word on whether any of them were piloted by Mansouri. This has stopped the circulation of old pictures of Mansouri at the controls of a jet. The National described how Mansouri became a pilot. Isis has reinforced fighters who are battling Kurdish forces for control of the town on Kobani close to the Turkish border, amid unconfirmed reports that the town was attacked from Turkish airspace. Reuters reports: Ocalan Iso, deputy leader of the Kurdish forces defending the town of Kobani at the Turkish border, said more Islamic State fighters and tanks had arrived since the US-led coalition began air strikes on the group on Tuesday. \u201cThe number of their fighters has increased, the number of their tanks has increased since the bombardment of Raqqa,\u201d Iso told Reuters by telephone. Islamic State-controlled territory in the city and province of Raqqa was hit in the air strikes on Tuesday. He said Islamic State forces had advanced to within 8 km (5 miles) from the southern periphery of Kobani, which is also known as Ayn al-Arab - closer than they had been at any stage. There more unconfirmed reports that militants have made gains south of Kobani. Saudi Arabia has confirmed that it participated in the US-led campaign and that the son of kingdom\u2019s crown prince was one of the pilots. \u201cAn official source revealed that Saudi air forces took part in military operations in Syria against the Islamic State group and to support the moderate Syrian opposition, within an international coalition, to combat terrorism..., and to support the fraternal Syrian people in returning security, unity and development to this devastated country,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency said. Separately it released pictures of the son of the Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud returning to base. Britain\u2019s former ambassador to the US, Christopher Meyer, has criticised Labour\u2019s apparent insistence on UN security council backing for air strikes in Syria. Meyer accused Labour of subcontracting its policy to China and Russia who as permanent members of the council would be expected to veto such any such resolution. Writing on for Politics.co.uk Ian Dunt detects a softening of Miliband\u2019s stance on the need for a UN backing. Citing this morning\u2019s interview on the Today programme, Dunt quotes Miliband saying: \u201cI think for the legitimacy of the action taken in Syria it would be better to have a UN Security Council resolution.\u201d Dunt writes: That weakening of the language from \u201cwhat needs to happen now\u201d to \u201cwould be better\u201d suggests Miliband will not cling to his Security Council requirement for long if parliament is recalled to authorise UK military action. But who knows? He\u2019s clearly keeping his options open. A militant group in the Philippines have threatened to killed two German hostages, unless Germany stops supporting the US-led campaign against Isis, according to the Site monitoring group. The Abu Sayyaf Group also demanded a ransom payment, Site said. Video footage from the Isis-stronghold of Raqqa suggests life on the streets has returned to normal after the first wave of US-led airstrikes. The unverified footage was uploaded today by anti-Isis activists in the city. Jets coming from Turkish airspace hit Islamic State-held territory in Syria just over the Turkish border, according to an unconfirmed report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It said the strikes occurred just before and just after midnight local time west of Kobani also known as Ayn al-Arab. It is unclear which country carried out the attacks. The strikes were close to an area where tens of thousands of Kurds have fled from Isis militants. Turkey has denied that it gave permission for it airspace to be used in the attack. Syria has urged Britain and the west to coordinate attacks on Islamic State militants with Damascus. In an interview with BBC News, Bassam Abu Abdullah, from Syria\u2019s information ministry, said: \u201cWe are facing the same enemy.\u201d He confirmed that the US had informed Damascus about the air strikes before they took place, but he said the campaign should involve a broader international coalition including Syria, Russia, China and Iran. He also urged the west to tackle ideological and financial support for Isis in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. Abdullah also stressed that the Syrian army was leading the fight against Isis on the ground in Syria. He said: \u201cWe are facing one enemy. We should cooperate. We can\u2019t ignore the fact there is a Syrian government ... The Syrian army is still the only power [which] is fighting terrorism [for] three years.\u201d He said Syria was not inviting Britain to take part in air strikes against Isis in Syria and that the issue should be a matter for the UN security council. Abdullah said the current UN security council resolution on Syria was not enough to justify attacks on Syrian soil. At the end of the day the west should coordinate and cooperate with the Syrian government. We are facing the same enemy - Isis or groups like al-Nusra. They are a serious challenge to humanity. As Mr Cameron mentioned they want to kill British [people]. They want to kill everyone who is opposed to their ideology. We should approach the question of combating terrorism more comprehensively. It is not [just] a question of air strikes. I mean [tackling] the financial support for these terrorist organisations. Some members of this coalition are involved in supporting terrorism like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey. We should include other important regional states like Syria, Iran, Russia, China. It is not a question of the west only. It is not only air strikes. The British parliament should discuss the question of ideology and financial support for these terrorist organisations. Five air strikes hit Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria near the Iraqi border on Wednesday, according to a British-based monitoring group. Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told Reuters the raids had hit the border town of Abu Kamal and surrounding areas. It was not clear who had mounted the air raid. A US-led alliance launched air strikes on Islamic State in Syria on Tuesday. A spokesman for the U.S. military said those strikes were \u201conly the beginning\u201d. Journalist Zaid Benjamin tweets an image purporting to show the location of one of the strikes, in the industrial area of Abu Kamal. Labour leader Ed Miliband has suggested his party would back air strikes in Iraq but not in Syria. In an interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Miliband echoed the prime minister by saying Isis was a \u201cthreat that cannot be ignored\u201d. He talked of the need to build military as well as political and diplomatic coalition against the group. He would not be drawn on whether Labour would back air strikes in either Iraq or Syria. But on Iraq he said Labour would \u201ctake very seriously\u201d any request from the Iraqi government. \u201cWe should we be open to that request,\u201d he added. On Syria he came close to ruling out Labour backing for air strikes. \u201cThe situation in Syria is somewhat different,\u201d he said. Miliband pointed out that unlike Iraq, Syria is not asking for intervention. He said he would be calling for a UN resolution on air strikes in Syria. \u201cAir strikes alone will not defeat Isis,\u201d Miliband said. The US military has released new video footage of Isis targets being destroyed in the first wave air strikes against the group in Syria. The targets included: A compound north-west of Raqqa A storage facility near Abu Kamal A vehicle storage area near Abu Kamal The BBC is reporting that Parliament will be recalled on Friday to discuss Britain joining launching air strikes against Isis. An announcement about the recall is expected after the Labour Party conference draws to an end on Wednesday afternoon, it said. Britain\u2019s main parties have been moving towards a Friday recall, the Guardian reported on Tuesday. Sources have confirmed this to the BBC\u2019s political team. Welcome to live coverage of the US-led battle against Islamic State [Isis] militants in Iraq and Syria as Britain is coming under pressure to join the campaign. The concerted bombardment, which began on Monday night and is being led by the US together with five Arab nations, is the main talking point at the UN General Assembly in New York. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments: David Cameron said Britain \u201ccannot opt out\u201d of the battle against Isis, as he is set to hear a formal request from Iraq to launch air strikes against militants. Speaking to NBC the prime minister said: \u201cThese people want to kill us. They\u2019ve got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition ... to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation.\u201d Parliament is expected to be recalled on Friday to approve British air strikes against Isis. The Iraqi leader Haider al-Abadi is expected to ask Cameron for help in fighting Islamic State at a meeting at the United Nations in New York. Cameron will then travel back to Britain to consult his Cabinet and Labour before making a final decision on any military action, according to the Mirror. Barack Obama claimed the backing of five Arab nations for intensive military attacks against Isis targets in Syria showed the offensive was not \u201cAmerica\u2019s fight alone\u201d. Overnight strikes against Isis took place in concert with five Arab allies \u2013 Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar \u2013 and marked a substantial escalation in the campaign against the militant group also known as Isil. The first wave of US air strikes on the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in north-east Syria killed 30 people, mostly militants, residents told the Guardian. \u201cAt first, I thought it was an air strike by Assad,\u201d said local resident Mohammed Sheiko. \u201cBut it was different this time. It lasted for 30 minutes and the sound of bombing was louder than usual. I saw smoke coming out of the governorate building and from the al-Rasheed gardens. The wife of Alan Henning, the British aid worker kidnapped by Islamic State militants, has made a new plea for his release after being sent an audio recording of her husband. Barbara Henning said that Alan was \u201cpleading for his life\u201d in the recording. The most sophisticated and expensive warplane in the US arsenal, the F-22 Raptor, made its combat debut in the assault against Isis. It joined its more seasoned cousins the F-15 and F-16, as well as the B-1 bomber and armed drones in attacking Islamic State (Isis) training camps, barracks, headquarters and vehicles in north and eastern Syria."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
