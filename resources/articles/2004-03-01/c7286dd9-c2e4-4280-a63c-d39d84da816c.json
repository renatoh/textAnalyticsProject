After the latest slip-up in a slapdash season, the timing was unfortunate. Beaten 2-0 at Southampton on Sunday to slump to eighth in the table, the Merseyside club can ill afford to be fretting over their England striker's future just now, and Owen himself can hardly allow matters off the pitch to cloud his own vision. The 24-year-old's 10th penalty miss in 23 attempts for Liverpool, combined with an uncharacteristic and nagging hesitancy over the other chances that came his way at St Mary's, betrayed a player drained of confidence. \"He's absolutely devastated because he cares so much about Liverpool,\" said his team-mate Jamie Carragher. \"He's desperate to help us get into the Champions League.\" With Owen misfiring, that task may prove beyond G\u00e9rard Houllier's side. The striker's campaign has been wrecked by injuries - to shin, ankle and thigh, undoing last year's work on his notoriously fragile hamstrings - with three months lost in mid-season. Since he returned from the last of those niggles, his edge has been blunted. He has scored three goals in 14 appearances, and only one in the league, a return that hardly encourages Liverpool to offer him the biggest contract in their history. Yet this is Owen, scorer of 151 goals in 286 appearances, and faith in the forward survives. The England vice-captain's goal ratio is forever only one match from snowballing into an avalanche. His career has been marked by peaks and troughs: his opening 10 games last season yielded only one penalty, there were 13 goals in his next 16 matches, two in the next 15, then 12 in 12 at the end. This season began with a flurry of eight goals in as many games. Yet now, more than ever, Houllier is in need of consistency to revive his own reputation on Merseyside. It is his wretched luck that his talisman is shorn of all conviction at the critical moment. \"I'm not worried about Michael,\" insisted the Frenchman as he surveyed the implications of the 2-0 defeat on the south coast, a match Liverpool dominated. \"He's going through a difficult patch, but I know he'll come through it.\" Player and manager will now meet to discuss who should be the side's penalty taker, the miserable memory of another miss - at Portsmouth in the FA Cup - still smarting. \"He's desperate for a goal,\" said Houllier, who must have thought the goal his striker plundered so smartly in freezing Sofia this month would signal a deluge. \"The good thing about him is that he never struggles for confidence.\" Some may need convincing of that given the image of Owen with his head in hands at Southampton, a picture of misery. Sven-Goran Eriksson will be relieved that Owen tends to flourish more consistently with England, but he has hardly wanted for opportunities at club level, even when asked to play largely as a lone striker. Antti Niemi thwarted him at St Mary's; when Owen did elude the Finn, he could only prod the ball against the post from close range. \"He missed a couple of chances before the penalty, but as far as I'm concerned it was brave of him to take it having missed the last one,\" said Carragher, who is expecting an immediate riposte to this latest disappointment against Portsmouth at Anfield tomorrow in a league game Liverpool simply must win. \"There'll be plenty of criticism, but over the years Michael has shown his mental strength and he'll be the first to admit he's going to need that again now. \"He's the type of player who's likely to bounce back and shut everyone up on Wednesday. All the players and staff are right behind Michael and I think the fans will be too against Portsmouth because they know what he's done for the club. There are no fans better than ours for getting behind a player when he's feeling a bit down.\" This would be a timely occasion for the Kop to rally behind their man. Too often in the past Owen's name has been missing from those chorused before kick-off, the reticence perhaps born of the forward's status as national hero before he had ever truly established himself in his club side. Now, as their principal threat, he must rediscover his bite if Liverpool are not to end the season toothless in mid-table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
