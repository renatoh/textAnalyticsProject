They surround Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where she lives, but make her think of Nepal, which has become something of a second home. \"I always say, when I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near,\" she laughs. Neubauer's passion for travel, and in particular for southeast Asia, has inspired a project whose legacy will be measured in generations, not years. Neubauer was a teacher and an educationalist before she set up a travel company in the 1980s. \"To me, travel is a school without walls,\" she says. Myths and Mountains was ahead of its time in its approach. \"It was a time when lots of people were doing 10 countries in 12 days. But we asked: what is the country about and how do we design trips to say it?\" Neubauer felt it important to give back to the locals they visited. \"We put roofs on schools, gave a few scholarships to schools,\" she says, \"but they were band aids on bleeding arteries.\" She asked one friend what he would like if he could have anything he wanted for his village. \"He said a library, and a lightbulb went off,\" she recalls. \"If you build a school it's for students, if you build a hospital it's for sick people. But a community library is for everybody.\" READ Global had its origins with Neubauer and porters hiking over a 12,000ft pass to a Nepali village, carrying 900 books. Today, the organisation has established 67 libraries, providing nearly 2 million villagers with resources to educate and empower their communities. An award from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently allowed READ to expand into India and Bhutan, and also to establish its own office in San Francisco, independent of Myths and Mountains. As Neubauer says: \"I really believe if organisations like this are going to survive they have to be able to go ahead on their own.\" It's this philosophy that has been key to READ's success. Alongside each library, a local business is seeded to support and sustain it, whether that be cloth-bag making, a tractor plough or an ambulance service. Villages that want a library are required to submit their own proposal, buy the land, and put in at least 10% of the cost themselves. That model aided READ's survival during the 13-year civil war between Maoists and the Nepalese government. \"During that entire time nobody touched a library,\" says Neubauer, \"because the library belonged to the village. And what's more revolutionary than education?\" While Neubauer has relinquished the running of READ, she remains on the board, and Myths and Mountains still supports the charity with fundraisers, and by introducing clients to its work. Neubauer's achievements are a triumph of nous, determination and leadership, but it's her enthusiasm that most inspires. Even after 30 years, Neubauer's travels still fill her with delight. This week, she will be taking her grandchildren to Nepal for the first time, \"to see what crazy Granny has been up to all these years. I'm so excited I can't see straight,\" she admits. \"The country is going to blow their minds.\" So, we suspect, will their grand- mother's incredible legacy.
