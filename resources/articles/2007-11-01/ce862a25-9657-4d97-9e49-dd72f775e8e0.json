The GMB was generous to its staff: we trade unionists worked at a merchant's folly, in the heart of Surrey, where we played snooker every lunchtime. There, at the age of 30, Mary learned to swim in its pool and to ride my bicycle. She was striking: raven-haired, with a straight back, stylish jewellery, crackling humour - Chanel and a sharp mind. She came from a humble background in Kennington, south London, of which she was fiercely proud. Her father Jock, an independent socialist tunneller from Scotland, and Grace, a forthright south Londoner, brought her up in a council house. After leaving school early, she did various jobs including working for a bookie. At 18 she was travelling the country's racetracks, holding her own with all those she came across in that particular world. She had a brief period at Camberwell School of Art, where she developed a keen artistic eye. Her elegant drawings graced the programme for her funeral. She secured a place at Durham University as a mature student to read philosophy and excelled in logic. Long after leaving the GMB, she joined the British Council as its industrial relations adviser, becoming indispensable in conducting sophisticated negotiations with trade unions, now on the opposite side of the table. But she quickly moved out and up as a general duties officer overseas. Mary's most important work was for African and Indian communities. She was sent to Bombay, Delhi, Lilongwe and Dar es Salaam to run aid programmes and select future leaders for training in the UK. In difficult and still secret circumstances, she was involved, during the late 1980s, in talks in Kurdish Iraq and Palestine. From the early 1990s, she held high positions in the UN and ODA (Overseas Development Agency)/DfID (Department for International Development), working closely with cabinet ministers, including Clare Short, on international development strategy and on the UN fund for population activities. After travelling widely around the world, and living in Manhattan, she decided to start a new life. In 2000, she bought a lovely medieval cottage under the castle wall in Ludlow. She had a part-time post at the Civil Service Appointments Board, where her incisive brain quickly sifted out the most promising candidates. She also scrutinised public servants' conduct and sat on the employment tribunal at Shrewsbury. Her acuity and fairness in dealing with people shone through all her contributions. She was dotty about her succession of cats, mostly refugees from Battersea. She enjoyed nothing more than the company of a small group of friends, united over more than one bottle of claret. Sadly, she enjoyed her cigarettes too much as well. Mary was forthright and pragmatic, and this included her announcement to us individually of her cancers. She wanted to leave her affairs well marshalled, to see that her friends would not be put to trouble and, indeed, would celebrate her life at a wake in her own sybaritic style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
