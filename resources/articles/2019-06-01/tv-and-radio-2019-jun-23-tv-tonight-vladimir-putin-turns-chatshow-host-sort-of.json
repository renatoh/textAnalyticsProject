So the logical next step for Vladimir Putin is to host a chatshow. This semi-scripted comedy sees a 3D cartoon of the Russian leader hosting human guests in front of a studio audience. Can\u2019t be any more discombobulating than watching Piers Morgan interviewing Donald Trump. Phil Harrison The Lawyer: Walter Presents 11pm, Channel 4 This excellent new Scandi-noir from Hans Rosenfeldt (The Bridge) has a lot to unpack in its opening episode, but be patient and you may find it hard not to stay up and binge-watch more (all 10 episodes will be available on All 4 after broadcast). It\u2019s an intriguing tale about a defence lawyer and his police officer sister\u2019s search for the person responsible for an explosion that killed their parents when they were still young. A thrilling foray into the Copenhagen underworld. Mike Bradley Gentleman Jack 9pm, BBC One Sally Wainwright\u2019s latest Yorkshire yarn takes a sombre turn as, having had the spring knocked out of her step after being called \u201crepugnant and queer\u201d, the redoubtable Anne Lister starts to feel less redoubtable on receiving a rebuff from the insipid Miss Walker. Have the smitten pair danced their last tango in Halifax? MB Beecham House 9pm, ITV Gurinder Chadha\u2019s tropefest feels Poldark-like (shirtless hero meets young West Country temptress). In 1795, a British former soldier (Tom Bateman) tries to start a new life in Delhi, and to do that he needs a trading licence \u2013 but a jealous French general is set on frustrating him in more ways than one MB S.W.A.T. 9pm, Sky One Good news for fans of stun grenades and terse hand signals: the violent but sentimental drama about an elite LA strike team has returned. Season two kicks off with a huge earthquake disrupting operations across the city, but The Shield creator Shawn Ryan ensures that there is at least a little grit amid the soap. Graeme Virtue Reel Stories: Noel Gallagher 10.30pm, BBC Two Not many people have appeared on both The Word and Newsnight, but Gallagher is one of them. He is the interviewee here in a format where Dermot O\u2019Leary shepherds a star through their life in TV moments. Also in line for wry reminiscence are trips to Maine Road and Downing Street. Jack Seale Film choice The Danish Girl, 11pm, ITV3 Tom Hooper\u2019s well-crafted drama tells the story of Lili Elbe, a Danish artist who was born the male Einar Wegener, and in 1930 became one of the first people to undergo sex reassignment surgery. It\u2019s lightweight, but Eddie Redmayne plays Elbe sensitively, with the aid of Alicia Vikander as wife and fellow painter. Paul Howlett Sport choice 2019 European Games, 10am, BT Sport 1 Day three action from Minsk, Belarus. Cricket World Cup: Pakistan v South Africa, 10am, Sky Sports Cricket Group stage match from Lord\u2019s.
