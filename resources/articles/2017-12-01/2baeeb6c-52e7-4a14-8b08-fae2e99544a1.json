Rooney has played well as Everton have recorded four wins and a draw in the Premier League since Allardyce agreed to become Ronald Koeman\u2019s replacement last month, scoring six goals, including the third from the penalty spot in the 3-1 victory over Swansea on Monday. The 32-year-old has been substituted in each of those matches as Allardyce seeks to keep him fresh for the Christmas period and the former England manager acknowledged that his return to form since leaving Manchester United in the summer is an indication that his career still has some way to run. \u201cI think the move and the timing of the move looks like it was perfect for Everton and perfect for him, and he\u2019s proving that now,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cThe last year at United he wasn\u2019t playing and he wanted to play. So he\u2019s come to Everton and after a difficult start for everybody because of results, he\u2019s come through that period now and we really need him, we need him at that level, and to continue at that level for the rest of the season. \u201cHe\u2019s had a huge career but he\u2019s only 32, not in his mid 30s. Looking after yourself a different way when you go into your mid 30s is what it is all about now.\u201d With 10 Premier League goals, Rooney has already achieved his most successful campaign in front of goal since the 2014-15 season at United, when he managed 12. He signed a two-year contract with an option of a third last summer but Allardyce expects his future to be in more of a supporting role, with Everton understood to be keen on signing a striker in the January transfer window. \u201cHe\u2019s not a frontline player now. We know that, we both accept that and we both see that role a little deeper, but we still want to use his guile and his experience around the box,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cLook at the goal he scored at Newcastle, it was a real striker\u2019s goal. He was the only man to say: \u2018I\u2019ll put myself in the position just in case it comes off the goalkeeper.\u2019 So the rest of the players if playing well and we get possession, create opportunities in the final third, and get Wayne in the final third, then that\u2019s where he\u2019s been best throughout his career. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be as a front man, it can be in behind as a No10. He showed against West Ham it can be in the right side of a three and still have the opportunity to get in the box and score. But he\u2019s got a big opportunity in terms of forward passing to me. He can make the cutting edge pass which we saw against Huddersfield and Liverpool and that\u2019s an important part as well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
