In the case of Ben Ainslie it turns out this is literally the case \u2013 at least for the observer who has only ever witnessed Britain's leading current Olympian in the throes of waterbound action. Presented for the first time with the entire Olympic collective of team Ainslie \u2013 coach, fitness man, training partners \u2013 in the improbable surroundings of the Hard Rock Cafe Mallorca, the eye is drawn, in some confusion, to the platoon of hulking beefcaked twentysomethings also currently in situ at British sailing's favoured Mediterranean base. Now, which one's Ben? With a few moments to adjust it is in fact pretty obvious which one's Ben. Shorter and slighter than his fellow Team GB sailors (but at 35 a decade older than some), there is, on closer inspection, a distinct air of quietly purposeful charisma about Ainslie. It is the discreet magnetism of the genuine sporting champion, around whom, as Britain's sole Olympic competitor in the Finn class, the sponsored mini-industry that is elite men's sailing will arrange itself for the next five months. Make no mistake, the London Games aside, Ainslie is already established Olympic royalty. A three-time gold-medallist across two classes, another gold in familiar Weymouth waters would make him the most successful athlete of all time in his discipline. But, of course, it isn't just the medals that mark Ainslie out. To the landlubber there is a genuine mystique about sustained competition in a sport of such grand elemental extremes, a man who describes the water as \"home\" and whose existence is pegged out around a logistically dizzying pilgrimage across the seas in search of competition (rumour has it Ainslie once went almost a year without going home). Comparisons are often drawn with the competitive endurance of Steve Redgrave, but with Ainslie it is a little different. Rowing is a sport; whereas sailing is the habitat of the genuine amphibian, the career seadog who frankly wouldn't have it any other way. Not that Ainslie lacks anything as a competitor. The day after his appearance at the Palma Hard Rock the Royal Yachting Association finally announced it will not be taking any further action over the incident that saw him disqualified from the world championships in Perth last December. Obstructed by a media boat while trying to overtake, Ainslie leapt into the shark-friendly waters and swam across from his Finn-class boat to remonstrate with a television cameraman. It is not an incident he likes to dwell on, albeit to the sympathetic observer there is something alluringly Mr Darcy-ish about the whole episode. \"I did it for a reason, I was seriously annoyed with what had happened,\" he says, through the lunchtime hubbub of Palma's seafront Arenal sailing club. \"I don't condone it. And, yeah, I over-reacted, but I think most people would understand why. What I don't like is it's not a great example to youngsters. I guess I was just standing up for what I believe in. I'd asked them a number of times to get out of the way and they were clearly ignoring me. I wanted to make it clear that wasn't acceptable.\" Out in the clear flat waters of the wine-dark Med, it is not hard to see how such a scrape could arise. Even following from a safe distance there is a furious intensity about Ainslie's micro-management of his Finn: swivelling with capoeira agility beneath his rotating sail, continually tweaking and refining the performance of his equipment. Which is after all the point of the exercise: Ainslie and his fellow Britons now have five months to perfect the Olympic rig. It is a business of finding minute improvements where they can and even throwing the occasional dummy to the watching Danes and Germans training nearby. At one point Ainslie takes the helm of a motor boat in order to stare at his prospective sail for quite a long time, making tiny calculations of billow and swell. Basic equipment aside, success rests on principles familiar from any other sport: technical skill, tactical intelligence and extreme physical fitness. Ainslie is notorious for his commitment to conditioning. \"He's not really there yet,\" I'm told by one of the team. \"When he gets close to competition he's absolutely ripped.\" Beyond this success or failure can come down simply to reading the wind better than your opponent, a quality of seamanship that is part instinct, part experience, part nautical sixth sense. It may not be quite ready yet to displace football as the nation's favoured Monday night televisual spectacular, but this is a sport with its own undeniable visceral appeal. Later in the day the team stages a four-Finn training race. Ranged four-abreast against the fluffy blue Mallorcan sea-scape there is something unavoidably stirring about the union flag sails, an Olympic armada manned by the lone dangling figures tending their ropes and pulleys, only missing the familiar stirring TV commentary describing flag-draped triumph on some distant sea. If this is all a little sentimental, it is also a moment where the scope of the expectations encircling Ainslie really strikes home. Here is an athlete quietly getting on with the business of being an all-time great, assailed in his venerable pomp by the rarefied demands of a home Olympics that will, like it or not, define many careers. All being well Ainslie could win a gold medal in the first week. Should Mark Cavendish miss out on the opening day it could also be Britain's first of the Games, ensuring a hysterical sporting coronation among a wider audience who, right now, probably couldn't pick him out of a crowd in the Hard Rock Cafe. Does this not secretly drive the purist in Ainslie a little crazy? \"For any athlete competing at a home Games is just incredible. For me it's towards the end of my Olympic career. In some ways it does put extra pressure on. Every athlete has a fear of failure above everything else and I suppose it adds to that. Look at Jessica Ennis. I feel really sorry for her because she's put up there on a pedestal and is expected to be the star of the Olympics and win a gold medal and nobody really knows how difficult it is. But that's part of the Olympics. You have to deal with it.\" If Ainslie has an edge here it is perhaps simply that he is entirely immersed in his sport. Raised in Restronguet, Cornwall, he grew up on the water with parents who were also sailors. \"They thought they couldn't have kids,\" he says. \"They were all set to go off on a round the world race [the first Whitbread in 1973] when my mum discovered she was pregnant with my sister three weeks before the race. My dad ended up going on his own.\" Aged 12 Ainslie competed in his first international event. A first world championship came just four years later, followed by Olympic silver in the Laser in 1996 and gold in 2000. A personal bulking-out heralded a move up to the Finn in 2004 and 2008 and two more gold medals, garnished with MBE, OBE and now CBE. The knighthood lurks: twinned, no doubt, with a fourth gold in August. For now such concerns are safely beyond the bubble of Olympic preparation. As is pretty much everything else for a competitor who has remained unremittingly Spartan in his focus, unfettered by domestic commitments beyond the training unit. Has he never, in all those 19 years, felt the pull of a regular life? It is a question he answers with candour. \"A couple of times I've been close to meeting the right person and settling down. It's been a shame. I've missed out on some opportunities. You go through reality checks. Once every six months you think, well, all my mates are getting married and having kids and I haven't been home for three months. But I'm really lucky to do what I love doing. Hopefully I can have a normal life at some stage after.\" One thing is certain: the world will come calling should Britain's champion sailor complete a quartet of golds in Weymouth. After which don't expect to find Ainslie doing a Redgrave in the wider world of TV odd-jobs and sponsored glad-handing. An almost immediate departure for the America's Cup is scheduled, followed by plenty more competitive avenues for a life that will remain, determinedly, on the ocean wave. \"You do get that feeling when you've been off the water for a few weeks. After I had my back injury [last year] I came down to the marina and I guess I was pretty desperate just to get out there on the water. I think I'll always feel like that. It's a bit like going back home.\" JP Morgan Asset Management is title sponsor of Ben Ainslie's Olympic campaign. See behind-the-scenes video at facebook.com/benainslie1977.
