Raised in a small town of Bhadra in western India, Prakash preferred to spend his free time playing computer games in cybercafes rather than outdoors playing cricket with the other boys his age. But when he was still struggling to find a job at college, Prakash discovered Facebook\u2019s bug bounty programme, which rewards \u201cwhitehat\u201d hackers, who test the website for bugs and help protect users\u2019 data. Now, he\u2019s earned more than 10 million Indian rupees (\u00a3112,000) by testing websites like Facebook and Google for bugs, and helped protect millions of peoples\u2019 personal data in the process. A self-taught computer whizz who learned about hacking by reading blogs and watching Youtube videos, Prakash found his first bug easily - it allowed people to be discovered online after they\u2019d turned off their Facebook messenger service. Facebook paid him 33,000 rupees for that discovery. Since then, Prakash has reported more than 90 bugs to Facebook alone, and many more to companies including Twitter, Google, Dropbox, Adobe, eBay, Paypal and others. One bug he found allowed hackers to access any of Facebook\u2019s 1.6 billion users\u2019 information including messages, credit and debit card information and personal photos. Facebook paid him another 1 million rupees for finding it. Even though Prakash\u2019s discoveries have made him a rupee millionaire, he says he\u2019s never done it for the money. \u201cI\u2019m interested in companies like Facebook and Google because those companies have the most data on individual users in the world. \u201cI do this work to protect data. If it were just for money I\u2019d do it for companies with fewer users. I\u2019m concerned about user privacy and I am a user myself. I care about keeping data safe.\u201d In developing countries like India, bug bounty hunting is a growing sport. In 2015, Facebook received 13,233 submissions from 5,543 hackers from around the world, often from small towns in developing countries. India, Egypt and Trinidad and Tobago, in that order submitted the most reports and the company says the quality of the information hackers provide gets more sophisticated every year. Rahul Tyagi, a whitehat hacker from the small town of Gurdaspur in north India says many of his friends earn a decent living simply by hunting for bugs on websites such as Facebook and Twitter. \u201cThey earn around 1-1.5 lakh rupees (\u00a31000-1500) a month without leaving their bedrooms.\u201d Whilst India\u2019s burgeoning population of 1.25bn means that getting a job can be tough, bounty-hunting schemes provide an easy way for young Internet enthusiasts to make a living. \u201cPeople are just sitting at home with nothing to do,\u201d Tyagi says, offering an explanation for the country\u2019s large proportion of whitehat hackers. \u201cThey can\u2019t get a job, so they learn this.\u201d Tyagi\u2019s own motivations for hacking though, are slightly different. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting an appreciation from the giants of the world,\u201d he says. \u201cHacking requires a curious and creative mind. And you have to keep learning every day, because the technology is changing so quickly.\u201d Like many other big names on the Indian hacking scene, Tyagi comes from a humble background. \u201cI was the first in my town to get a computer. I started on Windows 98.\u201d His knowledge of computers earned him a reputation as the local techie when he was a teenager. \u201cPeople used to invite me to their homes to install Windows XP. They\u2019d give me food and sweets in exchange,\u201d he says. \u201cFor them it was a big thing \u2013 that I knew so much about computers.\u201d His first experiments with computer security were when he was just a child, trying to get a game for PlayStation 1 to work on his computer. \u201cI was the only kid in the whole of Punjab who could do that at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first hacks were experimental. Curiosity kept me going.\u201d Indian entrepreneurs and immigrants have been pioneers in the tech sector in the last few decades. But nobody saw India\u2019s tech boom coming. The country has a low computer literacy rate of less than 7% and until recently, the country\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure was weak and underdeveloped. Academics have cited the government\u2019s non-interventionist approach as one explanation for India\u2019s success in the IT sector. Former IT minister Pramod Mahajan once said that \u201cIT and beauty contests are the two areas the government has stayed out of.\u201d Prakash argues that India\u2019s cyber security sector could grow even faster with some help from the government. \u201cThe Indian government hasn\u2019t understood how big our potential is when it comes to hacking. The most talented hackers are Indian, the highest number of bugs are reported from here. We need to cultivate that talent.\u201d Trishneet Arora a 22-year old hacker from the city of Ludhiana in northern India started as an ethical hacker, and has created a successful cyber security business with his skills. \u201cImagine having the power to hack into some one\u2019s bank account and steal a million dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd imagine saying no.\u201d Arora believes the next world war will be won online, and that India\u2019s cyber security experts will have a major role to play. He explains that hospital software is a particular vulnerability and hackers like him are devising new ways to keep patients safe. \u201cIn the ICU the technology [one hospital] was using was a cloud-based machine,\u201d he explains. \u201cI hacked it, I found vulnerability and I shut it down. The person on the operating table could have been killed, and you\u2019d never be able to trace the killer. \u201cThat\u2019s the future of cyber attacks. They\u2019ll breach our security, we\u2019ll breach theirs,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting access to confidential information can destroy peoples\u2019 lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
