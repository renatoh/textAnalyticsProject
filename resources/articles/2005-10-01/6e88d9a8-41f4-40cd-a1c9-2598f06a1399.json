He said it would be difficult for the Iraqi administration to complete preparations in time. No agreement has been reached on basic requirements, such as whether the glass round the dock should be bullet-proof. A witness protection scheme was far from ready. There were reports earlier this year that preparations for the case, including the collection of evidence, were being hindered by the continuing violence in the country. Yesterday, at least 25 people were killed and 87 wounded when a bomb exploded at the entrance to a Shia Muslim mosque in Hilla, south of Baghdad, as hundreds of worshippers gathered for prayers ahead of the breaking of the fast on the first day of Ramadan. The front of the Husseiniyat Ibn al-Nama mosque was destroyed. The British official said he did not know when the Iraqi administration would \"get their act together\" over Saddam's trial and suggested the trial could be delayed until after the Iraqi election in December. He described the trial and expected execution of Saddam as \"a defining moment\" for Iraqis in that it would draw a line under that period of Iraqi history and provide reassurance that he would not be coming back. The British government will object to the use of the death penalty but expects to be ignored. The official said the execution of Saddam would not make much difference to the insurgency, which he expected to continue at the present level. Saddam will be tried for the massacre, nearly 25 years ago, of about 150 Iraqis in the village of Dujail. It is the first criminal case to be brought against the former dictator, who has been held in solitary confinement since his capture by US forces in December 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
