Embedded in Belfast and the Troubles, and in the post-Wall uncertainties of eastern Germany, this story of a love affair threads its way through memory and grief. It\u2019s alive with detail; haunted by a complex past; and written in 14-syllable lines, so supple you never notice the technique. What a poet! Christine Webb Burnham, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Please will somebody point out to Donald Trump, who believes that he is the subject of \u201cthe greatest witch-hunt in American history\u201d (House vote takes Trump a step closer to impeachment, 1 November), that 14 women and five men were hanged in Salem in 1692-93 (and Giles Corey was crushed to death after he refused to enter a plea). Ian Ferguson Thornton Dale, North Yorkshire \u2022 Terrific that young people are still being taught the values of good citizenship in school, but what makes them \u201cBritish values\u201d (Letters, 2 November), and how are they different from those of any civilised society? Rev Jenny Welsh London \u2022 You do not need a pumpkin to get Halloween callers (Letters, 2 November). I paint a face on a large orange and put that on the doorstep. It seems to work. Maxine Leyland Coulsdon, London \u2022 Janet Lail went \u201cchumping\u201d while collecting material for Bonfire NIght in Leeds (Letters, 2 November). In nearby Shipley we went \u201cprogging\u201d.
