Lewis, 37, has what appears to be an easy engagement on June 21 in Los Angeles when he will fight the Canadian Kirk Johnson, a contest which is not being recognised as a title fight by the WBC. Now the 31-year-old Klitschko will be added to the undercard. The deal was announced by Klitschko's German promoter Klaus-Peter Kohl, who said: \"After long negotiations I am delighted that this fight will take place. Lennox has demonstrated that he is a gentleman and a great champion who is not afraid of a challenge.\" Klitschko has suffered only one defeat in 33 fights and that came three years ago when he lost the World Boxing Organisation version of the title to Chris Byrd by stoppage after retiring with a dislocated shoulder in the ninth round. He is powerful and well conditioned, although critics would suggest his robotic upright style is tailor-made for Lewis. He may be best remembered by British fans for his second-round knockout victory over Herbie Hide in London in 1999, but Klitschko has victories over several highly ranked fighters on his record, and 31 of his 32 wins have come inside the distance. Tyson has made it known he wants more competitive action before any rematch and is tempted by offers laid before him by the veteran promoter Don King for him to take on his own rival Evander Holyfield or even to face the brilliant World Boxing Association champion Roy Jones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
