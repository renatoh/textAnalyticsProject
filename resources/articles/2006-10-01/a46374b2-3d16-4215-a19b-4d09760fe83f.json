Even more vividly they remember the afternoon in 1953 when Ferenc Puskas's dazzling Hungarians left Wembley with a 6-3 victory, inflicting England's first home defeat in international competition. There have been other defeats since, but now a new generation of football fans can lay claim to a trauma of its own. For, at the very least, last night's 2-0 defeat in Zagreb will force English football to reconsider its exaggerated idea of its own excellence. While the Football Association preside over the embarrassment of \u00a3800m-worth of incomplete stadium at Wembley, their gilded representatives were humiliated in an old-fashioned stadium, all corrugated iron, cracked concrete steps and raw passion. No self-respecting England Wag would have been caught within a mile of the place. This was the fifth match in the reign of Steve McClaren, the FA's choice to succeed Sven-Goran Eriksson after the World Cup debacle. Faced with the need to get at least a draw from a qualifying match for the Euro 2008 tournament, he sent out a team in an unfamiliar formation, with three central defenders. It was a system, he assured his critics, with which the players would easily cope. Very soon after the start of the match, it was clear that they were trying to write sonnets with alphabet soup. Croatia would have taken the lead in the first half had it not been for the resourceful goalkeeping of Paul Robinson. After an hour, however, not one of England's three central defenders could prevent Eduardo Da Silva heading the ball over Robinson's leap. A few minutes later Croatia's lead doubled when the goalkeeper, trying to meet Gary Neville's gentle back pass, missed his clearance kick when the ball bobbled on the uneven surface, bounced up over his boot and rolled into the net. \"Obviously the tactics didn't work,\" McClaren admitted. \"It was my decision and my responsibility.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
