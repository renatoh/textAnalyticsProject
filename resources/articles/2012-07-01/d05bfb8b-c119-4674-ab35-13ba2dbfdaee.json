Equally glumly, a Conservative MP weighed in to condemn the Right Rev Peter Price, the bishop of Bath and Wells, and the report on the 2011 riots that he presented to the General Synod at the weekend as \"complete drivel\". Actually, it wasn't. Testing the Bridges is the sort of frank, factual report you would want a community-rooted organisation to produce after events like the riots. The bishop's speech was clear and interesting. Anyone reading it will be struck by its reflectiveness and its appropriately religious concern. The \"spiritual ecstasy\" remark is in fact a quote from another priest in 1981. The riots are a serious subject. The bishop's speech and the report should be studied thoughtfully, not caricatured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
