No doubt they will dominate every aspect of rugby from now until the next World Cup. They even dominated the pool stages at France 2007. But there you go. After three years and 50 weeks of supremacy, they went and did what they tend to do at World Cups. And so, just like their team in France - sorry, Cardiff - out go with indecent cruelty their entire batch of fallen stars. The lot of them. It is tempting to replace them with a job-lot of Englishmen, for being as unfathomably successful as the All Blacks were inexplicably hapless when it mattered. But there must be room for others. This World Cup was full of other twists and turns, and pleasant surprises. 15 Jason Robinson (England) Just when it seemed his hamstring had snapped, and that would be that, back he came. A miraculous recovery, which sums up England. 14 Vilimoni Delasau (Fiji) Fiji lit up a tournament dominated by tactical kicking with their back-play. But just when you think it's all Island grace, this bloke runs at you. 13 Stirling Mortlock (Australia) He was injured, and the Wallabies went out early. But in a tournament dominated by, see above, tactical kicking he ran with explosive force. 12 Matt Giteau (Australia) In a tournament dominated... perhaps you get the drift... Giteau was inventive and elusive. And therefore different. 11 Bryan Habana (South Africa) Scored four tries against Samoa, got the surprise of his life when Takudzwa Ngwenya of the US took him on the outside, but resumed normal service in the semi. 10 Jonny Wilkinson (England) Who else? Wasn't at his best - nor was he in 2003 - but he exists in his own world where the rules are different. Jonny-world. Strange, wonderful place. 9 Mosese Rauluni (Fiji) For romance it should have been Andy Gomarsall. For authority, Fourie du Preez. For industry, Agustin Pichot. But Rauluni was just inspired from start to finish. 1 Andrew Sheridan (England) Even when the refs caught up on his dropped left arm at the scrum, he continued to deliver. As different from Jason Robinson as can be imagined, but just as emblematic. 2 John Smit (South Africa, capt) For saying to his team at 20-20 against Fiji: 'I am seeing in your eyes what I saw yesterday with the All Blacks and Australia. Now snap out of it.' They did. 3 Martin Scelzo (Argentina) There has to be a Puma in all this. Could have been Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe in the back row, but a prop is a tribute to where Argentine rugby comes from. Where it goes from here might be altogether more glamorous. 4 Simon Shaw (England) Made it at last. What a relief. A unique blend of the giant and the pixie. Powerful and dainty. 5 Victor Matfield (South Africa) Took the Argentine line-out apart in the semi. Pure class. A serious contender for player of the tournament. 6 Schalk Burger (South Africa) Could have been Martin Corry, who was reliability and dependability personified. But the effervescence of the solid Burger just pushes the Swiss clock out of the equation. 7 Nili Latu (Tonga) In the Bay of Plenty, where Latu plays, and in all surrounding areas, Richie McCaw would probably be considered superior by some distance. Like a light year. But at this World Cup, Latu stole the show. 8 Julien Bonnaire (France) France deserve a presence. For what they did in Wales. Their No 8 rose to the line-out occasion there against New Zealand, and was the pick of the French when it all went pear-shaped back in Paris against England. They looked good on paper: Eddie Butler's pre-tournament line-up from Observer Sport, 2 September 15 Chris Latham (Australia) 14 Aurelien Rougerie (France) 13 Stirling Mortlock (Australia) 12 Yannick Jauzion (France) 11 Joe Rokocoko (New Zealand) 10 James Hook (Wales) 9 Matt Giteau (Australia) 1 Tony Woodcock (New Zealand) 2 Raphael Ibanez (France) 3 Carl Hayman (New Zealand) 4 Bakkies Botha (South Africa) 5 Victor Matfield (South Africa) 6 Jerry Collins (New Zealand) 7 Richie McCaw (New Zealand) 8 Rodney So'oialo (New Zealand)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
