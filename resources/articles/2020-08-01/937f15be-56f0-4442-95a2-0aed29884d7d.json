Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has warned the country\u2019s football resumption will be put on hold if there are any further breaches of Covid-19 protocols, threatening to show the game \u201ca red card\u201d. Bolingoli appeared from the Celtic bench for the closing minutes of Sunday\u2019s draw at Kilmarnock. Days earlier, he had spent 24 hours in Spain without the knowledge or consent of Lennon. With the Scottish government already irate at the actions of eight Aberdeen players, who spent time in a busy bar on 1 August, only strong representations from the football authorities prevented two full rounds of fixtures from being postponed. Instead, Aberdeen\u2019s meeting with Hamilton on Wednesdaytonight, Celtic\u2019s trip to St Mirren on the same evening and the match between Celtic and Aberdeen on Saturday must now be rearranged. Lennon was scathing about the actions of the 25-year-old Bolingoli. \u201cPeople may say: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s been stupid,\u2019 but it\u2019s not stupidity,\u201d said the Celtic manager. \u201cThis has been premeditated. You don\u2019t book a flight to Spain on a whim. He knew exactly what he was doing. So this has been quite calculated. It\u2019s been total disregarding of the outcome and the risks involved, so he will be dealt with in the strongest possible way by the club.\u201d Lennon revealed Bolingoli had previously been spoken to by club officials about his behaviour during the pandemic. \u201cI think it is one of the worst behaviours from an individual I have come across,\u201d Lennon added. \u201cEverything has been tight and everything has been strict. He had been warned previously about travelling and he blatantly disregarded my instructions and the club\u2019s instructions. It is a complete act of selfishness. \u201cThis is a perplexing time for us all \u2013 it has been perplexing for everyone over the last six months, whether you are in sport or not. It is so fragile and for someone to put in jeopardy everything that we have been building on and working on is disappointing, We are all desperately disappointed with him. It\u2019s just appalling behaviour and one the club will deal with in the strongest possible way internally.\u201d Bolingoli and the Aberdeen contingent are likely to be investigated by the Scottish Professional Football League. Celtic\u2019s Champions League qualifying match against KR Reykjavik, due to take place next Tuesday in Glasgow, is still expected to go ahead. \u201cAfter the Hamilton game [on 2 August] we made it clear to all of the players they couldn\u2019t leave Glasgow as we gave them a couple of days off which they deserved,\u201d Lennon explained. \u201cBoli took it upon himself to go to Spain and not tell anyone and not tell anyone when he came back. Obviously, we found out about it on Monday and we were just so perplexed, but also in despair of it, really. \u201cNow we have had the message loud and clear from the government and the first minister. I feel for the club and everyone who has worked so hard over the lockdown to get everything in place to start football back.\u201d Bolingoli said: \u201cI am guilty of a major error of judgment. I know what I did was wrong and I know that I must now deal with the consequences.\u201d With his Celtic career all but over, it remains to be seen how the club deal with a player signed on a four-year deal last summer from Rapid Vienna, for a reported \u00a33m. Lennon refused to dwell on the impact to his team, who could be 11 Premiership points behind Rangers by the time they next play a domestic game. \u201cIt is disruptive,\u201d said Lennon. \u201cThere is no question about that. But it won\u2019t detract from what we want to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
