Corbyn is coming under renewed pressure to set out his backing for a fresh public vote more clearly, as the shockwaves from Labour\u2019s catastrophic performance in the European elections continue to reverberate. Shadow ministers will be shown the second part of a presentation on polling which began at last week\u2019s meeting, and according to one person present showed Labour was being \u201csqueezed from both sides\u201d. Corbyn said in the aftermath ofthe European elections that any Brexit deal would now \u201chave to be put to a public vote\u201d \u2013 though that could include a general election, and he subsequently suggested a referendum remained \u201csome way off\u201d. One shadow cabinet member and Corbyn loyalist described Labour\u2019s Brexit policy as \u201cin a state of transition\u201d, saying they expected it to shift towards a clearer stance in favour of a referendum in the next \u201ctwo or three weeks\u201d, rather than wait for their hand to be forced by restive grassroots members. Another shadow cabinet source said Johnson\u2019s imminent arrival in Number 10 on a hard Brexit ticket must be \u201cthe decisive factor\u201d for Labour\u2019s policy. Corbyn is content to allow the focus to remain on the warring Tories for the moment. But the Labour leader is facing a pincer movement from both sides of his deeply divided party. Another Europe is Possible, the anti-Brexit campaign group that works closely with leftwing Labour MPs including Clive Lewis and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, has announced that it plans a \u201csummer of resistance\u201d. Alena Ivanova, from the group, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing this summer is the growth of a mass and plural movement against Brexit, with mass demonstrations announced for both July and October, and lots of different organisations holding speaker tours and preparing for a referendum.\u201d She added: \u201cBut this movement needs to be radical, both tactically and politically \u2013 it has to become a hot summer of resistance, willing to disrupt the status quo.\u201d Meanwhile Tom Watson, Corbyn\u2019s deputy, has continued to push for a People\u2019s Vote, and will make a major speech on the issue on Monday. Recriminations from the party\u2019s poll performance have continued. Some shadow ministers, including some on the left, lament what one called the \u201cmalign influence\u201d of Corbyn\u2019s advisers, in particular his key confidant, Seumas Milne, and chief of staff, Karie Murphy, complaining that the pair insulate Corbyn from criticism and challenge. Several shadow cabinet members have told the Guardian that Corbyn himself was uncomfortable with the party\u2019s message in the run-up to the European elections, which he felt was insufficiently clear. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly under pressure: I don\u2019t think he\u2019s happy with the way it\u2019s working,\u201d one said. Another claimed: \u201cEven Jeremy, who has always held Seumas in awe, is increasingly dissatisfied with the messaging\u201d. The shadow cabinet was not consulted about the expulsion of former New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell for publicly admitting he had voted Lib Dem at the European elections. \u201cNo politician was involved in that decision,\u201d said one senior party source. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was said by allies to have been particularly irked about Campbell\u2019s expulsion, fearing it made the leadership look vindictive. The decision to drop shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry from prime minister\u2019s questions at short notice last week, after she spoke out about Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, also raised eyebrows. Corbyn was lambasted by colleagues at Monday\u2019s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), with one veteran of the Blair and Brown eras saying it was the worst they had witnessed, with Corbyn reading from a prepared script and failing to take on hecklers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
