But you won't like it. First, however, let's celebrate the arrival of digital engagement between government and citizens. The idea of carving a direct e-channel between government and the electorate, bypassing the mainstream media and pesky backbench MPs, appeals deeply to ministers. The reality, of course, is messy. The first attempt, the absurd Citizenspace forum, was created in the apparent expectation that the internet would inspire Britons to an Athenian level of deliberative democracy. It foundered in a storm of conspiracist passion, including death threats against the poor saps who moderated it. Since then, a realisation has emerged that, like other forms of political conversation, digital dialogues need boundaries. Within these boundaries, a certain amount of e-engagement now seems to be working. The interim report of the Digital Dialogues project, conducted by the Hansard Society on behalf of the Department for Constitutional Affairs, evaluates 16 attempts to engage citizens electronically in policymaking. They range from the Food Standards Agency's web forum to environment secretary David Miliband's ministerial blog. The Hansard Society cautiously endorses such initiatives. While any influence \"must be small given the numbers participating online\", e-participants have not been the usual suspects. The report says policy teams have \"attested to the value in the participation of these new stakeholders and the different - sometimes unique - qualitative and quantitative data they generate\". A further Digital Dialogues report is due out next month. By then, it may be possible to evaluate the latest and most spectacular phenomenon in e-engagement, the e-petition service set up by MySociety on the Downing Street website. Thanks largely to the furore around road pricing, the site, set up in November, has already created its own urban mythology - \"750,000 signatures are required for the government to take any notice\" - and conspiracy theory - \"now they have the email address of every member of the awkward squad\". Although still very much a beta test, my guess is that it's here to stay. Whether or not the PM actually reads the petitions - constitutionally, why should he? - it is already a valuable barometer of public opinion. It also graphically illustrates the limitation of direct e-democracy. Take, for example, the third most-signed petition on the site this week. It opposes \"proposed restrictions\" on photography in public places. More than 35,000 people apparently agree that there is no right to privacy when in a public place. This appears at odds with many of the 1.8m who signed against the \"sinister\" scheme for road pricing - yet many people I know claim to have signed both. The need to reconcile such irreconciliable viewpoints is why we have representative democracy rather than government by petition. So, here is my proposal for reducing car use. Install the road-pricing infrastructure, but don't worry about collecting tolls. Simply feed data to a website that would publish to all the position of every motor vehicle in Britain. Now, I have no idea how many tonnes of CO2 are generated by journeys that we would not want our employer or spouse to know about, but I bet the total is not insignificant. Post details of every journey online, and congestion would surely ease. There. I said you wouldn't like it. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
