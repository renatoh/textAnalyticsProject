But how can we vote for Jeremy Corbyn?", "bodyText": "For most progressive-minded, remain-leaning folk, is it even a dilemma? I\u2019m not sure. To them the logic must seem simple and straightforward: they want to eject a cruel and useless government and stop Brexit, and that means denying Boris Johnson a majority and replacing him with Jeremy Corbyn, who will end austerity and hold a second referendum. Job done. I wish it were as simple as that for me. But it\u2019s not. Because while I want desperately to avoid Brexit, and while I have nothing but contempt for Johnson and his hard-right party, the prospect of Prime Minister Corbyn fills me with dread. Not, I stress, the prospect of a Labour government, committed to spending billions on schools, hospitals and houses \u2013 Britain needs that badly \u2013 but specifically the notion of Corbyn and his inner circle running the country. The thought of it prompts in me, and the overwhelming majority of the community I grew up in, a fear that we have not known before. I\u2019m referring to Britain\u2019s Jews who, for the first time in their history, have concluded that someone hostile to them is on the brink of taking democratic power. Yes, of course, not every single British Jew holds that view. But the most recent poll found that 87% regard Corbyn as an antisemite, meaning an anti-Jewish racist. Why? The recitation is now wearily familiar. Recall that Corbyn\u2019s first reaction on hearing of a plan to remove a mural filled with hideous caricatures of hook-nosed Jewish bankers was to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Or that he decided to challenge two \u201cZionists\u201d not on their arguments but by suggesting that, though they \u201cmight have lived in this country for a very long time\u201d, they \u201cdon\u2019t understand English irony\u201d. Or that, when a Palestinian Islamist preacher was found by a British tribunal to have peddled the medieval and lethal myth of Jews feasting on the blood of gentile children, Corbyn declared that man a very \u201chonoured citizen\u201d, and invited him for tea in the House of Commons. (And those are merely some of the greatest hits; the full discography runs much longer.) For four years, Britain\u2019s Jews have \u2013 naively, perhaps \u2013 waited for the moment when one of these revelations would prove too much for the Labour faithful, shocking them into action. Perhaps it would be the discovery that, despite evidence against hundreds of party members \u2013 including those trafficking in grotesque neo-Nazi imagery and Holocaust denial \u2013 only a handful have actually been expelled. Or maybe it would be the BBC Panorama investigation that showed how Corbyn\u2019s team repeatedly interfered in antisemitism cases as they went through a supposedly independent disciplinary process, \u201cmainly so they could let their mates off the charge\u201d, as one whistleblower, driven to the brink of suicide, put it. Or perhaps it would be the fact that Labour has become only the second political party ever to be investigated for institutional racism by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (the other was the BNP). But no. No revelation has ever proved shocking enough that it couldn\u2019t be explained away by those who\u2019d rather not see it. So publicly Labour\u2019s luminaries insist they are fighting a \u201cruthless\u201d fight against antisemitism, doing all the Jewish community has asked of them, as John McDonnell said this week, even though the facts point the other way. We\u2019re meant to cheer that Chris Williamson has been barred from standing again as an MP. But Jews remember that, even when Williamson\u2019s penchant for egregious Jew-baiting was well known, Corbyn was still praising him. Just a few months ago, in fact, Corbyn called him \u201ca very good, very effective Labour MP. He\u2019s a very strong anti-racist campaigner. He is not antisemitic in any way.\u201d None of this has stopped. Labour\u2019s crop of prospective parliamentary candidates has included several with a documented history of anti-Jewish bigotry, Twitter back-catalogues playing on all the familiar tunes of Jewish conspiracy, greed and the rest of it. Two candidates were forced to step down on Thursday, one for calling a Jewish fellow councillor \u201cShylock\u201d. It suggests this is no longer a problem of one man, but that the malaise is now institutional. And yet Labour\u2019s high command could soon be governing the country. Labour doesn\u2019t even need to win many seats; Johnson needs only to fail to win a majority and Corbyn will be closing in on Downing Street. What should Jewish voters and those appalled by anti-Jewish racism do about that? Plenty advise Jews to shelve their angst in return for a government that will stop Brexit (Jews are overwhelmingly pro-remain). In effect, Jews and their would-be allies are being told that some racism is, if not quite acceptable, then a price worth paying. That seems to have been the bargain struck with those Labour \u201cmoderates\u201d who were once so admirably vocal in their denunciation of the leadership on this issue and who are now \u2013 minus Tom Watson \u2013 knocking on doors to put Corbyn in No 10: you\u2019ve got your second referendum, now shut up about the Jews. It\u2019s an uncomfortable feeling, to be part of a small community that can be so quickly cast aside for the supposed greater good. Progressives and remainers who care about racism are left with a dilemma. Some try to swerve around it by denying the evidence, telling Jews they are wrong about the racism they experience. That\u2019s not a great look. Others (rightly) point out that Johnson is himself a bigot and an Islamophobe \u2013 as if we should accept that this is a contest of two racists and we should back the one we agree with more. Still others war-game assorted hung-parliament scenarios that might magically both despatch Johnson and deliver a non-Corbyn prime minister. But all of this is to dodge the main point \u2013 which is that none of us should have ever been put in this position. None of us should be forced to choose between a hard Brexit enforced by an Islamophobe, and electing a man whose record fills one of Britain\u2019s smallest minorities with fear. Many, Jews included, ask themselves how bad would it really be. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? Of course this isn\u2019t the 1930s and, despite the Sunday Telegraph\u2019s front page, most Jews would not leave the country. But that the question is even in the air, that someone who sees Jews as not quite \u201cus\u201d \u2013 \u201cthey don\u2019t understand English irony\u201d \u2013 is deemed eligible to be prime minister, makes our presence here feel conditional and shaky. And, whether Corbyn makes it to Downing Street or not, to realise that the historic party of social justice in this country finds a little bit of racism acceptable for the sake of the larger cause, and that many millions of voters agree \u2013 well, that realisation contains its own heartbreak. It means that what we thought about this country wasn\u2019t quite true. I understand that to many, all this will sound overwrought. I\u2019m afraid that Jewish history has made us that way, prone to imagining the worst. We look at our usually sparse family trees and we can pick out the pessimists, those who panicked and got out. It was they who left their mark on us. You see, the optimists, those who assumed things would work out for the best, they never made it out in time. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
