The singer and YouTube star, whose real name is Harvey Leigh Cantwell, announced the news on social media, telling fans he does not have any symptoms and is now isolating for 10 days. The 21-year-old said: \u201chi, wasn\u2019t gonna worry anyone and say anything but now the story\u2019s out, i have coronavirus, I\u2019m all good, no symptoms, just isolating for the next 10 days. already super bored so prepare yourselves for my Tik toks.\u201d \u201cIt just proves that us youngsters can get it and not even realise,\u201d he told his 4.5 million Instagram followers. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m chilling, but I\u2019m going to be in this bedroom for a while so I\u2019ll see you guys on the other side.\u201d All contestants are being tested for Covid-19 twice a week, with the first tests taking place on Monday and revealing HRVY\u2019s infection. This year\u2019s stars are set to be introduced to their professional dance partners on 12 October, just days after HRVY\u2019s isolation is due to end, ahead of a pre-recorded launch episode on 17 October. From that point onwards contestants will be eliminated from the show if they test positive for the virus. The live shows will start the following week, on 24 October. The show\u2019s professional dancers have been isolating together in a hotel as they prepare the big dance numbers, and once the pros and celebs are matched up they won\u2019t have contact with other pairs, the BBC\u2019s entertainment boss, Kate Phillips, explained. There are also fewer contestants this year, a smaller studio audience and there will be no crowding around presenter Claudia Winkleman after each routine for post-dance interviews. This year\u2019s lineup includes the actor Caroline Quentin, the Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing and the Olympic boxer Nicola Adams, who will be performing as part of the show\u2019s first same-sex couple. A BBC spokesman confirmed a member of the Strictly Come Dancing group had tested positive. They added: \u201cWe have rigorous protocols in place to manage Covid-19 as the safety of all those involved in the production is paramount.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
