After a strained 48 hours for Venezuela, in which almost the entire country was affected by a blackout, thousands of demonstrators turned out to champion their respective leaders, both of whom claim the presidency. \u201cI\u2019m here to support President Maduro \u2026 he is the constitutional president of our Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Reyes, a 52-year-old woman who was among the crowds at a pro-Maduro rally in central Caracas. She said she was there to defend Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s political heir and denounce \u201cthe imposter Guaid\u00f3\u201d as a threat to peace. Experts blame the massive power cut on poor maintenance, incompetence and corruption. But Maduro and his backers claim it was part of a US plot to destroy Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s leftist Bolivarian revolution and force him from power. \u201cWe condemn this cowardly terrorist attack,\u201d tweeted Bolivia\u2019s president, Evo Morales, one of Maduro\u2019s few remaining regional allies. Reyes said she believed that version, but was also willing to countenance opposition claims that the blackout was caused by government failings. \u201cPerhaps it was a lack of maintenance. We aren\u2019t ruling any hypothesis out,\u201d she said. Oskar Oramas, a 24-year-old student activist for Maduro\u2019s ruling Socialist party, said he was protesting the \u201cescalation of persecution\u201d against his government by the US. \u201cI have come to take a stand against the United States because they have made it clear they are our enemies \u2026 We will defeat them because we are experts in peace,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want to turn us into another Syria and we will not allow this to happen,\u201d one activist shouted from a red sound truck bearing the slogan: \u201cHere you don\u2019t speak badly of Ch\u00e1vez!\u201d In cities across Venezuela, members of the opposition poured on to the streets to demand political change amid fears that Maduro\u2019s security forces would seek to put down anti-government protests with force. \u201cThey have destroyed a whole country,\u201d demonstrator Jorge Lulo, a psychologist, told the Efecto Cocuyo website as he marched in Caracas carrying his country\u2019s red, yellow and blue tricolor. \u201cWe are fighting to escape from tyranny.\u201d Guaid\u00f3, who most western governments have recognised as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president, told supporters at the rally: \u201cRight now we are [protesting] in more than 50 cities around the country in order to bring an end to the darkness, the hunger and the misery.\u201d Speaking through a loudhailer, he urged demonstrators to remain mobilised \u201cuntil we achieve the freedom of Venezuela\u201d and announced that he would summon a peaceful march on the capital at a yet-to-be announced date. \u201cToday this [tragedy] has a name and a surname \u2026 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro!\u201d, Guaid\u00f3 said to loud cheers. The latest chapter of Venezuela\u2019s long-running political crisis began on 23 January when Guaid\u00f3, a young opposition leader, declared himself the legitimate interim president. He was quickly recognised by regional powers including Brazil, Colombia and the US, and anti-government demonstrations ensued, leaving many convinced that Maduro\u2019s fall was imminent. Those predictions did not come to pass, however, and the opposition challenge had appeared to be losing steam. Last week, however, Guaid\u00f3 made his return to Venezuela after conducting a tour of South America in violation of a travel ban imposed by Maduro\u2019s government. Efforts to unseat Maduro may also be re-energised by this week\u2019s power cut, which left hospitals and homes without power, and reinforced opposition to him. \u201cThis is a joke,\u201d complained one disillusioned civil servant who was looking on as the pro-Maduro march passed down Avenida Mexico in Caracas. \u201cWe\u2019ve got no electricity and they\u2019re using the generators to stage a march rather than sending them to the hospitals.\u201d \u201cHis government is like a cancer,\u201d added a woman, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. \u201cThis government is a goner.\u201d On Saturday, anti-Maduro marches were also reported in cities across the country including Barcelona, Barquisimeto, Coro, La Asunci\u00f3n, Maracaibo and Puerto Ordaz. The power outage, which continues to blight large swathes of Venezuela, has also sparked fears that the South American country could enter a period of disorder. \u201cIt\u2019s a tinderbox, and Maduro\u2019s survival thus far gives a false sense of stability,\u201d said Benjamin Gedan, the national security council\u2019s Venezuela adviser during the Obama presidency. \u201cA sustained blackout could \u2026 spark widespread dissent.\u201d Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, said that despite the battle of rhetoric between Maduro and Guaid\u00f3, he believed some kind of back-channel talks were taking place that could lead to a peaceful settlement. \u201cI get the sense things are happening behind the scenes. I am more optimistic than I was, say, a month ago about the prospect of some kind of non-violent, negotiated transition,\u201d Ramsey said. Addressing his rally on Saturday, Maduro lashed out at his political foes in Venezuela and the US and accused \u201cinfiltrated coup-mongers and saboteurs\u201d of attacking the country\u2019s electricity system in a high-tech bid to topple him. \u201cWe are at war,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cWe have been at war for 20 years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
