Our weekly Premier League Years marathon started on Tuesday morning and despite staying up all night we\u2019re still only on 2008-09: fact. It means we\u2019ve only just caught up with the Big Cup action. There were a whopping 36 goals in eight games, it says here. That\u2019s 4.5 per match, another reminder that defending is going the same way as democracy, dignity and the private digital conversation. So far it\u2019s been a triumphant Big Cup season for our brave boys. Liverpool\u2019s 5-0 shellacking of Atalanta and Manchester City\u2019s 3-0 win over Olympiakos mean that, in this season\u2019s competition, English clubs have a combined record of P10 W9 D1 L0 F28 A2. How d\u2019ya like that fruit and veg, \u201cEurope\u201d? There\u2019s every chance the good form will continue on Wednesday: Chelsea are at home to their goalkeeper-feeder club Rennes, while Manchester United are hoping to turn another corner away to Istanbul Basaksehir. Alas, BT Sport does not yet offer a red-button service that allows us to watch the game while listening to Roy Keane\u2019s internal monologue. United will also meet up with an old friend: Rafael da Silva, the right-back who captured the hearts of their fans when he offered out the entire Liverpool team at Anfield in 2011. Even if Chelsea and United win, they will struggle to match Liverpool\u2019s spectacular dehipsterisation of Atalanta in Bergamo. Diogo Jota, who played instead of Roberto Firmino, scored his first Liverpool hat-trick. This prompted much talk of a changing of the guard from those unfamiliar with a concept called rotation that has been in existence since the early 1990s. Such talk did not impress J\u00fcrgen Klopp much. \u201cGood performances never give me a headache,\u201d he said, violently headbutting a wall six times to show how little his head was hurting, and how often Liverpool have won Big Cup. \u201cBut the world is sometimes a really bad place that in the moment when somebody is shining, we speak immediately about another player who played for us, it feels like, 500 games in a row. We would not even be in [Big Cup] if Firmino were not with us. On a good day he is impossible to defend against.\u201d More to the point, Liverpool\u2019s usual front three allows The Fiver to bang on about $exy MFS in the hope our Prince-spired acronym will catch on. MJS just doesn\u2019t compare. Besides, it\u2019s already been taken by My Job Scotland and MJS Construction Ltd, a company that was originally established as a reinforced concrete frames specialist, before expanding into groundwork and complete construction solutions. Maybe their next expansion should be into football: there are a few managers who could do with tips on how to build a solid foundation. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Gregg Bakowski from 5.55pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Istanbul Basaksehir 1-3 Manchester United, while Rob Smyth will be on hand for Chelsea 2-0 Rennes at 8pm. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019m just absolutely speechless at how much money we\u2019ve raised, how many have been donated and how many kind messages of support have come in\u201d \u2013 11-year-old Imogen Papworth-Heidel, who has completed her challenge to reach 7.1 million keepy-uppies, one for every UK key worker, to raise money for a number of charities. She completed 1,123,586 herself during an unbroken 195-day run, reaching more than 7,000 a day during lockdown and the summer holidays. The remaining 5,976,414 were donated by around 2,000 people who took videos of themselves joining in the challenge and emailed them to her parents. Go Imogen! RECOMMENDED LISTENING Fresh out of the editing suite, here\u2019s the latest Football Weekly podcast. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRemember how Small Talk always used to ask \u2018who\u2019d win in a fight between a lion and a tiger?\u2019 Well, looking at the Colombian Primera B, the Tigers have been up against the Lions five times this year with one win, three draws and one loss each. So, sadly, there\u2019s no conclusive winner, something the great Samuel Eto\u2019o was presumably aware of during his infamous appearance\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cRe: Mark Jones on football dinosaurs (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). I always thought Zinedine Zidane in his playing days (especially when he still had some hair, at least around his head) resembled this. Of course, after the 2006 World Cup final, this was highlighted even more\u201d \u2013 Leon-Ben Lamprecht. \u201cStegArturosaurus. A football dinosaur native to Chile that is clearly identifiable by its spiky ridges resembling a mohawk\u201d \u2013 Adam Mungin. \u201cPlain Old John Terry-dactyl, Duvan Zapat-osaurus and Richard Keys\u201d \u2013 Tim Jones. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Tim Jones. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Diego Maradona is in recovery following successful surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain. Mamadou Sakho has won a libel action against Wada and is to receive \u201csubstantial damages\u201d after it repeated false claims about a drugs test taken by the defender. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when you are a professional athlete and are accused of doping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the worst thing that can happen to you.\u201d Southampton striker Danny Ings could be out for six weeks with knee-gah. \u201cIt could be worse, but he\u2019ll be out and it\u2019s not good news for us,\u201d sighed Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. $tevie Mbe has a right funk on with Jordan Jones and George Edmundson after the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers pair breached Covid regulations to attend a party. \u201cThe players know they\u2019ve let themselves down and their families, they\u2019ve also badly let their teammates down and the supporters,\u201d he fumed, before seemingly conjuring up some Middle Ages disciplinary action. \u201cThey will be punished, internally.\u201d Manchester United head coach Casey Stoney isn\u2019t best pleased after their Conti Cup tie at Everton was called off for safety reasons. \u201cI must make it clear that we as a club wanted this game to be played and were accommodating in the options that were put forward,\u201d she sniffed. Swindon boss Richie Wellens is now Salford City boss Richie Wellens, dropping down a division to return to his former club. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for me to take the club to where they want to be,\u201d he cheered. And Vrelo Sport have been awarded a 3-0 win over Spartak in the Serbian lower leagues after the visitors pitched up with seven players and got one dubiously knacked inside the first five seconds, forcing the referee to abandon the match. STILL WANT MORE? Like a student in freshers\u2019 week, Liverpool are reinventing themselves. Jonathan Liew has more. Segue alert: what is the heaviest league defeat suffered by a title-winning team? This week\u2019s Knowledge has the answer. Manchester United\u2019s Emily Ramsey tells Suzanne Wrack about hunger, talent and playing for the club she grew up supporting. Brendan Rodgers deserves more praise for Leicester\u2019s brilliant start, so says Brendan Rodgers Martin Laurence. And they got there in the end. Tom Jenkins was there for Wimbledon\u2019s return to Plough Lane. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO!
