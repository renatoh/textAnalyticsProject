A veteran of two World Cups and a defensive lynchpin during the 2015 campaign in Canada, the 60-cap centre-back was expected to push starters Clare Polkinghorne and Alanna Kennedy for a first XI berth. Her withdrawal due to a suspected foot fracture means there is no recognised central defensive cover in Ante Milicic\u2019s 23-player squad should further injuries arise, with left-back Steph Catley now the most viable alternative in the middle of the Matildas defence. It weakens an area of the team that has already come under close scrutiny after Australia conceded eight goals in their last two competitive matches \u2013 friendlies against the USA and Netherlands. Adding to concern in the Matildas camp was Mary Fowler, who was withdrawn from training after going down with a hamstring tweak. The 16-year-old spent the rest of the session on the bench after receiving treatment, and Milicic said her withdrawal was precautionary. The coach remained relatively calm about the situation at training in Valenciennes ahead of Australia\u2019s opening Group C match against Italy, focusing on the positive of being able to hand rising talent, 18-year-old midfielder Karly Roestbakken, a chance to make her full international debut. \u201cThis is an unfortunate situation for Laura [Alleway] and as a group we feel for her,\u201d Milicic said. \u201cWe have given her every opportunity to return to full fitness ahead of the tournament, but with our first match now just days away we needed to make a call which has provided Karly [Roestbakken] a fantastic opportunity.\u201d The Canberra United youngster was called into camp a few days ago, having been a leading light in assistant Gary van Egmond\u2019s Young Matildas team across recent campaigns. The injury comes as a huge frustration for the 29-year-old Alleway who had found herself on the outer of international selection in recent years, before a standout season in the W-League helping Melbourne Victory to its first premiership earned her a Matildas recall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
