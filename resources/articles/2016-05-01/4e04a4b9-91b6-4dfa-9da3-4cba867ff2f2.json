In two weeks\u2019 time, more than 5,000 politicians, business leaders, aid organisations and civil society groups will convene in Istanbul for the inaugural world humanitarian summit. The conference is intended to reinvigorate the international community\u2019s response to what the UN has called \u201cthe highest level of human suffering since the second world war\u201d as it struggles to cope with conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and South Sudan and the attendant mass displacement of people. In a report, the international development committee (IDC) says that, despite spending record sums on humanitarian aid \u2013 $25bn (\u00a317bn) a year \u2013 the world is failing to meet the needs of those people whose lives are devastated by war, natural disasters and climate change. First and foremost, it says, the government must underline the paramount importance of upholding and defending international humanitarian law. Last week, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) pulled out of the summit, saying it did not believe the event would do enough to hold governments to account over increasingly frequent violations. The chair of the IDC, Stephen Twigg, said the committee\u2019s investigations into Yemen had shown the suffering caused when the rules governing the protection of civilians in war are ignored. \u201cWe know from our inquiry into the crisis in Yemen that upholding international humanitarian law is essential to delivering aid,\u201d he said. \u201cUsing their presence at the summit, we urge the UK government to press all actors on the global stage to bolster international humanitarian law.\u201d In an echo of some of the criticisms levelled by MSF, Twigg said that there was \u201ca distinct lack of agreement\u201d on what the priorities at the summit should be. \u201cIn a world where the lives of millions of people are devastated by wars and disasters, the global community is struggling to cope with demands on funds and support,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is a real urgency to develop a new approach to address current and future humanitarian needs more effectively.\u201d The IDC report says the Department for International Development (DfID) should focus on six areas for reform. As well as addressing violations of law, it also needs to do more to help shape the debate on building resilience and to ensure the global humanitarian system does not squeeze out local groups. It recommends that DfID pushes for institutional and funding reforms to achieve a more holistic approach to development and humanitarian assistance, and that there is a greater emphasis on preventing and resolving crises using everything from early warning systems to analysis of political risks on fragile states. A government spokesperson said: \u201cBuilding on the success of the supporting Syria conference, the UK is approaching the first ever world humanitarian summit with an ambitious set of objectives. The UK is a world leader in responding to humanitarian crises and the summit will provide a once in a generation opportunity to consider how we use our combined resources to address humanitarian problems more efficiently and effectively.\u201d The report\u2019s final call is for action to make sure that humanitarian groups trying to help people in conflict zones are not punished as an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of counter-terrorism legislation. It notes that humanitarians working in Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan and Gaza often have to operate in areas where proscribed armed groups are present. Andrew Mitchell, a former development secretary, told the IDC that the perils of working in such areas were often compounded by what he called \u201cthe Guant\u00e1namo Bay danger\u201d, where Muslim people and groups working in development risk becoming associated with terrorists through no fault of their own. Such associations, he said, could lead to humanitarian groups being sanctioned under counter-terror laws or finding themselves in financial difficulties because banks are reluctant to handle their funds. Unlike jurisdictions such as Australia and New Zealand, UK counter-terrorism legislation makes no provision for humanitarian exemptions, meaning that those trying to negotiate access with forbidden groups in Syria could find themselves in breach of the law. ActionAid\u2019s head of humanitarian response, Mike Noyes, said: \u201cThe global failure on the refugee crisis shows that the world humanitarian system is in desperate need of an overhaul. \u201cWorld leaders should listen to the main recommendations of this report, including the need to boost the effectiveness of humanitarian response programmes by providing greater funding to the local organisations which are on the frontline and best prepared to respond to any emergency.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
