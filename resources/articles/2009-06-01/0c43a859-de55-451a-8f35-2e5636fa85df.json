The tribute that might have given him the greatest pleasure, though, will be among the shortest. Twelve horses will run the Derby at Epsom in two-and-a-half minutes this afternoon, and though O'Brien has gone, his brilliance still runs through the race like a watermark. Six of the runners in today's Classic \u2013 half the field \u2013 will be saddled by Aidan O'Brien, who succeeded his namesake as the master of the famous racing stables at Ballydoyle in County Tipperary. But the legacy of Vincent O'Brien is not confined simply to the quality of the gallops and facilities that he built at Ballydoyle, and that his successor has used to such impressive effect. It is bound up, too, in the DNA of almost every colt in the race. Nine of the dozen runners today are the sons of stallions who stand at the Coolmore Stud, a few miles from Ballydoyle, which Vincent O'Brien helped to establish along with John Magnier, his son-in-law and stud manager. Of the three colts conceived away from the Coolmore covering sheds, two were sired by stallions that have since died. Even Sea The Stars, the favourite for the Derby and the only runner sired by a living, non-Coolmore stallion, is a half-brother to Galileo \u2013 who stands at Coolmore. Coolmore has dominated the breeding industry for many years but, even by their standards, today's iron grip on the premier Classic has no precedent. Flat racing at its highest level is a sport, an industry and also a game. It is a way for the super-rich to butt heads via the unpredictable medium of horseflesh. For 200 years, bloodstock empires have risen to prominence on the turf, but the vagaries of thoroughbred genetics and inheritance have prevented complete control by any individual or dynasty. But this time it feels different. Coolmore seems to have turned the game into a walkover, with even Sheikh Mohammed and his family trailing in its wake, and its power, if it is possible, may still be on the rise. So how did Coolmore come to rule the Flat racing world? Like so many successful businesses, the answer seems to be: right people, right time, right place. First, there was Vincent O'Brien, with his extraordinary eye for a horse and his ability to train them to the second. Next, there was the late Robert Sangster, heir to a pools fortune and willing to punt his millions on O'Brien's genius. And finally, there was Magnier, whose business brain made it all work, and kept it expanding from one year to the next. \"Vincent O'Brien was an amazing trainer, a genius with a gift that can't be taught,\" Pat Eddery, who rode Golden Fleece to victory for O'Brien and Sangster in the 1982 Derby, said this week. \"I was there for five years, and they were the best five years of my life. Every year, they went to the sales with his eye for horses, and they would buy good ones, but not only that, he could train them and improve them too. \"Vincent really started it all when he bought Nijinsky [the 1970 Triple Crown winner] but the way it is set up now, with so many really good stallions and mares, is all down to John. Even after Sadler's Wells [Coolmore's biggest money-earner and the most successful sire in racing history] retired last year, Galileo has come to the rescue. It's just non-stop there.\" The extraordinary success of Sadler's Wells, who is thought to have earned an average of at least \u00a330m per year in stallion fees for Coolmore over a period of two decades, was another vital factor in the stud's rise to power. In the last decade, meanwhile, it is Aidan O'Brien's quiet, unrelenting talent for training big-race winners that has delivered a long line of new stallions for the Coolmore barns. \"It's a testament to what [Vincent O'Brien] started that we have so many horses to run in the Derby,\" O'Brien said yesterday. \"It was a privilege to be asked to train somewhere that had been put together by such a special man, and daunting too. \"The horses are picked and bred for us, and it was Dr O'Brien who put the gallops and the stables and the system together. We still train very much according to the principles he laid down.\" Like any dominant business, Coolmore is not short of critics. Many British breeders point to generous tax concessions from the Irish government that until recently gave their breeding industry significant advantages over its competitors. But there is an appreciation, too, that they are very good at what they do. \"You can't deny that at the moment, they are supreme, and there's no way I can sit here and say that British breeding is dominant because clearly it isn't,\" Louise Kemble, the chief executive of the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, said this week. \"They have had it good for a very long time, but they made hay while the sun was shining and who can blame them. \"And you have to respect what they've done, they've always delivered quality, and at least they are close enough that if British breeders want to use their bloodlines, they don't have to go to the other side of the world.\" Coolmore's grip on those bloodlines, which define every fresh generation of racehorses, appears to grow stronger with each passing year. It may not be too long before we see a Derby with nothing but Coolmore-sired horses in the field. Such is the might of the world's biggest stud. In a game that is built on the unpredictable, which is designed to defy every attempt to control it through weight of money or sheer force of will, the one result this afternoon with no obvious upside for the Coolmore Stud would be a victory for John Gosden's Debussy. Debussy is the 66-1 outsider of the field. It looks like this could be game over.
