With the heavy losses of last year's World Cup still fresh in the memory, the RFL is anxious that the game is supported by firm financial foundations of sponsorship and television money. The RFL is naturally keen for the game to go on to back up the revived enthusiasm for international football. But Greg McCallum, the director of rugby, said: \"I'm a bit surprised that the ARL has announced the date. It had been agreed that, before the go-ahead was given, a financial and business plan would have to be finalised. \"And since there is no free weekend for the game, there is the issue of moving Super League matches involving clubs that will have the biggest representation in the Great Britain side. We also need to speak to Sport England about the financial implications of the Test. \"I am confident the game will go ahead but there are several issues yet to be addressed and we cannot comment further.\" Wigan and St Helens, who will probably provide a large proportion of the Lions side, are due to meet at the JJB stadium on the night of July 12 when the other club likely to be hit by call-ups, Bradford Bulls, are scheduled to play Wakefield. Both games could be moved to midweek slots. The Australian Rugby League chairman Colin Love, who was very impressed by Great Britain's competitiveness in the recent Ashes series, said the Test would be played at Stadium Australia or the Sydney Football stadium. \"The July 12 date has been locked in,\" he said. \"Great Britain really performed well in the Ashes so it's going to be a very competitive Test.\" Great Britain took the first Test at Huddersfield's McAlpine stadium before the Kangaroos rallied with wins at the Reebok stadium in Bolton and Wigan's JJB stadium. The Great Britain squad would fly out to Australia as early as possible after the previous weekend's games. Bradford and St Helens will be in action on the Sunday and Wigan on the Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
