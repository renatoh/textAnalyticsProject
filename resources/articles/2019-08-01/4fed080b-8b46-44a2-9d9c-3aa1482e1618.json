In a detailed response, the BHA emphasises its belief that \u201cwith the appropriate design and strict controls in place, the whip does not compromise the welfare of horses during races\u201d. It also states that only one horse has been marked by the whip or \u201cwealed\u201d in the last two seasons, and none at all in 2017, from a total of 225,000 runners in that time. Britain\u2019s whip rules allow jockeys to use the whip a maximum of seven times in a race on the Flat and eight times over jumps. The maximum permitted level of use is the same in Ireland, while in France, the limit has recently been reduced to just five strokes. The whip has been a controversial issue in the sport for many years, despite regular reductions in the number of times it can be used, how it can be used and also significant improvements in whip design to produce a foam-padded design that all jockeys are required to use. The whip is designed to produce noise rather than inflict any pain on a horse, and stimulate a flight response to ensure that it runs to the line. The number of breaches of the whip rules has declined in recent years but can still prove highly controversial, in particular if these occur at the end of a major race such as the Derby or Grand National. While jockeys who break the rules are penalised with suspensions from racing, the winners still keep the race and owners, trainers and jockeys receive the appropriate prize money \u2013 even if their jockey has broken the rules. Apart from possible welfare concerns, the visual impact of a jockey being seen to whip a horse for encouragement in the closing stages of a race has also been seen as a possible deterrent to new fans of the sport, and younger racegoers in particular. The whip is clearly an issue that is unlikely to go away and the BHA\u2019s statement on Wednesday sets out the framework on which it will base its defence of its use for encouragement. It points out that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) recently stated that it is \u201csatisfied that the rules in place are sufficient to restrict and limit the use of the whip in horse racing\u201d, while the BHA has also recently established an independent Horse Welfare Board, chaired by a former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, to \u201cdevelop a new welfare strategy for the industry\u201d. It also states that \u201cthe thresholds for use are set well below the point at which its use might compromise the welfare of a horse\u201d, which could prove to be a point of fierce debate if or when the Labour Party institutes its \u201cindependent review\u201d. \u201cWe respect the right of politicians to ask questions of our sport and we can and do reassure them of the high standards of welfare in British racing, and the steps we are taking to enhance our welfare record and reputation,\u201d Will Lambe, the BHA\u2019s executive director, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe have had constructive engagement with Labour\u2019s shadow Defra team to date, and will respond in a measured and united way as a sport to ensure that the appropriate facts and information are set out confidently and fairly.\u201d Thursday\u2019s tipping guide Chelmsford\u2019s polytrack hosts the most valuable card of the day but it does seem rather odd \u2013 to this punter, at least \u2013 that the richest race on the card, a \u00a320,000 conditions event for juveniles, is also the least likely event to catch the eye of anyone looking for a bet. Just four runners are due to go to post, including one \u2013 the impeccably-bred State Crown \u2013 which is making its racecourse debut. Can that really be a sensible or effective way for a sport that depends on betting revenue to disburse \u00a320k? State Crown, homebred by Godolphin, is definitely the interesting one on paper. By New Approach out of a Dubawi mare, he has several very useful performers among his close relations including the Group One winner Blair House. He is distinctly weak in the market ahead of his debut, however, and Surf Dancer (3.00), who was behind last week\u2019s exceptional York winner Mums Tipple on his debut, is now odds-on, putting a final nail in the race\u2019s coffin when it comes to betting interest. There are a couple of more attractive bets on the card, though, including Houlton (4.00) in the stayers\u2019 handicap. Both of his wins to date have come at today\u2019s track and recent runs at Wolverhapton and Newcastle suggest he is still on a workable mark. Solar Heights (2.00) also goes well at Chelmsford and will take plenty of beating earlier on the card, while Kermouster (3.10) and Endless Joy (1.20) have obvious chances at fair odds at Carlisle and Ffos Las respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
