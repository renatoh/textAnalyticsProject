The criticism centres on the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action. He was no-balled for throwing on his previous two visits to Australia, and Sri Lanka have closed ranks around their leading wicket-taker. That siege mentality will be strengthened by McGrath's comments yesterday which focused on the former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, whose side beat Australia - and McGrath - in the 1996 World Cup final. Ranatunga's strategy of aggressive cricket and verbal assaults were Australian in their roots but McGrath is still upset. \"Sri Lanka used to employ niggly tactics to try to get under your skin,\" he said. Muralitharan is unlikely to play until the new year because of recent hernia surgery but that has not stopped accusations here that he is still a chucker. Ross Emerson, who called him for throwing in Adelaide four years ago, reiterated that the Sri Lankan's action was still suspect. \"Muralitharan's action has changed since 1995 - it's got worse - but he is not worried about it because who is going to call a guy that has got more than 400 Test wickets?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
