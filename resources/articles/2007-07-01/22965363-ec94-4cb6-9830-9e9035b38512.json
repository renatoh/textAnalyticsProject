Likewise, he said, if every conversation you and I ever had was published, we would be dead.\" Mr Campbell had earlier asked Mr Clinton what it was like having the whole world talking about his sex life. \"He said as long as he couldn't hear them all at the same time he could get by.\" Princess Diana During the mourning, Tony Blair tried to push the monarchy to modernise, Alastair Campbell writes.

He said they are very different people in a very different age.\" After news of the death, Mr Blair told Mr Campbell: \"People will be in a state of real shock.

Around the time of the May 1997 election Paddy Ashdown, the then leader, was \"not keen\", but agreed to a cross-party committee on constitutional reform. Mr Blair still wanted a merger, however. In October 1997 Blair was moving towards an April reshuffle, bringing two Liberals into the cabinet, with a merger after the next election and proportional representation afterwards, \"at which point the Tories would be wiped out.\" But in September 1998 Mr Blair told Mr Ashdown proportional representation could not be delivered in that parliament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
