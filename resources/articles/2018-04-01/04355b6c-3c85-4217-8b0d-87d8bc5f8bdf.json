The Homelessness Monitor says the explosion in the placement of homeless families in temporary homes, often many miles from where they work and go to school, is driven by a dwindling supply of social and private rented housing. A combination of high rents, the loss of social homes through right to buy and the impact of welfare reforms means councils in many parts of the country struggle to access settled housing as they try to tackle escalating homelessness, it says. Councils are left with limited resettlement options, especially in high-rent areas in the south-east, the report says, because benefit-reliant tenants are either priced out or informally barred from available stable housing. Since 2010 the numbers of homeless people in temporary accommodation has grown by 61%. Council spending on this form of housing has increased by 39% over the same period, at a cost to the taxpayer of \u00a3845m in 2016. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of the homelessness charity Crisis, said: \u201cIt\u2019s truly terrible that, across England, councils are finding it increasingly difficult to find homeless people somewhere to live. This means ever more people are ending up trapped in B&amp;Bs and hostels, with no stability and often in cramped conditions. \u201cToday\u2019s report makes it clear that, unless we take action as a society, this problem will only keep getting worse\u201d. Temporary accommodation, including hostels and B&amp;Bs, is provided by councils as interim housing for homeless households, but it is not uncommon for tenants to be stuck in it for years, sometimes in overcrowded, insanitary and unsafe conditions. The report identifies the government\u2019s four-year freeze on local housing allowance introduced in 2016, which has left rent support for private sector tenants lagging far behind actual rents, as both a major driver of homelessness, and a barrier to rehousing homeless households. The monitor says it is striking how homelessness has shot up the political and media agenda over the past year. \u201cIt feels like it is, finally, an issue that can no longer be ignored as \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in the course of welfare reform and retrenchment,\u201d it says. Last year an all-party committee of MPs called rising homelessness a national crisis, while the National Audit Office criticised the government for failing to get a grip on the problem. There has been increasing public concern over a growth in rough sleeping, the most visible form of homelessness. The monitor notes the government has devoted \u201cenergy and profile\u201d to the issue, introducing the Homelessness Reduction Act this month and promising to eradicate rough sleeping by 2027. But it questions whether the political will exists to tackle structural causes of homelessness such as welfare reform, poverty, and cuts to health and social care budgets. Strikingly, the report notes that social housing \u2013 once the main source of homes for people owed a homelessness duty \u2013 is increasing hard to access, with two-thirds of local authorities reporting difficulties in this area, not least because of the long-term erosion of social housing stock under right to buy. But the report also says some housing associations are reluctant to supply homes to tenants reliant on benefits, or those with complex health needs. Some now demand that prospective tenants nominated by councils must pass a financial risk test before they are offered a tenancy, putting homeless people at a disadvantage. The private rented sector is even harder to access, with nine out of 10 councils reporting that they found it difficult to source suitable and affordable settled housing from private landlords, many of whom are reluctant to let to people on benefits because of the perceived financial risk. Caps on housing benefit have seen an exodus of low-income tenants from wealthy areas, the report says. In Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster councils in central London, numbers of housing benefit claimants have dropped by more than 40% since 2011. Although the increase in homelessness over the past few years initially showed up most strongly in London, the monitor says the problem is now growing much faster in the south and the Midlands as issues of housing affordability and supply spread. Although traditionally high levels of rough sleeping in London are stabilising, the report notes, the capital has seen an increase in hardcore entrenched rough sleepers who are resistant to support. The monitor is commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Crisis, and compiled by a team of academics primarily from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The report is based on a review of official data and research, alongside a survey of councils and interviews with housing experts. Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cEvery day we see the bruising toll that living in unstable temporary accommodation \u2013 especially B&amp;Bs and hostels \u2013 takes on people\u2019s lives. We see children routinely fall behind at school and their health and happiness left in tatters, while their parents suffer with the heartbreaking belief they\u2019ve failed their children.\u201d A spokesman for the housing and communities department said: \u201cEveryone deserves a safe and decent place to live, and we are providing more than \u00a31.2bn to ensure homeless people get the support they need. \u201cTo ensure they can access permanent accommodation, we are also investing \u00a32bn in social rent housing and allowing councils to borrow more to build homes. \u201cIn addition, the Homelessness Reduction Act came into force last week, requiring councils to help those at risk of being homeless sooner.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
