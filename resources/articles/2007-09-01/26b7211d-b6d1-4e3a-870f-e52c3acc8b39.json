The prevailing view of his later works as constituting a neoclassical reaction against Romantic trends isn't quite borne out by his Missa Solemnis in E, which aspires, on occasion, to Beethovenian grandeur and turbulence, and seemingly influenced Berlioz, even though the latter disliked him. Cherubini had a tendency to place effect before substance, however, and the Mass's handful of startling moments - most strikingly the quickening heartbeat rhythms that usher in the Et Resurrexit - don't always compensate for inspirational thinness elsewhere. The performance, conducted by his long-time champion Riccardo Muti, is well nigh faultless, though. There is some sumptuous orchestral playing, and both choral and solo singing are particularly splendid. Two of Cherubini's Motets are added as a bonus - slight works, beautifully sung."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
