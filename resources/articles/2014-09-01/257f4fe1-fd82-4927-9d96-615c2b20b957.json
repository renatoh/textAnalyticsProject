Those beguiled by the psychedelic garage-pop of this LA foursome\u2019s debut will find more impeccable mid-60s nuggets here, as sun-dappled as they are faintly sinister. Rivetingly, the downbeat Nothing to Hide throws in one tempo curveball. If anything, though, instrumentals such as Ferus Gallery are even better than the songs with words. There is a point where the vocals (all four Las sing) stop being retro nasal tributes and start sounding a little thin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
