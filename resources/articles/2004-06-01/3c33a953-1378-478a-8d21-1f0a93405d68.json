In a tacit admission that it cannot compete at the cut-price end of the market, BT is hoping to win the telecoms high ground by making a series of promises which it hopes will convince callers that while it might not be the cheapest, it cannot be beaten on customer service. The first phase of advertising will see BT promote three promises to its customers through TV and radio ads costing \u00a35m over the next four weeks. The campaign, which will break on Sunday during England's Euro 2004 match against France, is expected to be the first stage in a longer-term marketing strategy which will set out a series of commitments against which BT's performance can be measured. BT is initially promising to do everything it can to ensure engineers turn up on time to fix problems, always offer customers the option of taking to a human when calling a helpline, and will ensure customers get to speak to the relevant expert when they call with a query. Although the commitments will be regarded by some consumers as no more than the basic level of service they expect from BT already, the adverts are the first external signs of a company-wide three year programme designed to improve BT's response to customers, introduced by chairman Sir Christopher Bland and chief executive Ben Verwaayen. The first TV commercial in the series of ads, made by St Lukes, sees a family group getting ready to go tobogganing despite the lack of snow outside. They join a crowd of similarly equipped families atop of London's Primrose Hill, who wait as the first wisps of snow fall from the sky right on cue. The ad ends with the line: \"If you knew when to expect things, imagine how much more you could do with your day\". The radio commercials will feature real BT employees talking about the promises. BT's feelgood approach is in marked contrast to the emphasis placed on no-nonsense cheap calls by the phone company's competitors. BT has seen its home telephony market share eroded by new companies such as Talktalk, owned by Carfone Warehouse, as well as Tesco Telecom, OneTel, Tele2 and the latest arrival US-backed ToucanTalk All-You-Can - as well as by the rapid growth of mobile services. Recent figures suggest the company could be losing as many as 150,000 customers a month, attracted to promises of unlimited free talk or very low call rates. BT saw pretax profits before financial charges increase 10% to \u00a32bn in the year to end of March. Amanda MacKenzie, BT's head of marketing services, said the campaign was the starting point in a campaign designed to win customer's confidence. \"This is absolutely about customers and the work we have be doing to tackle customer dissatisfaction. You have to really tangibly prove you are improving so there have been lots of internal programmes to do that. \"Something that came through from our research into customers was that big companies don't do this, they don't make promises, so we decided to do it and make some. \"Everybody is out there shouting price and people go with expectations that aren't always delivered and they want the same standard of service. That's why we've been running testimonial campaign about people returning to BT. \"What we've gone for first are the three most powerful messages in terms of customer frustration, but I think we may well go further,\" she said. The company has also had to contend with the deregulation of the directory inquiries market, which has spawned an large number of new services including 118 118, which has established itself with the help of two 70s style runners who feature in its ads. BT has also been fighting back on a number of other fronts, with a high-profile campaign to market its broadband service, which has gained the group 2.5 million customers and the development of a hybrid phone that can act as a mobile as well as connecting with home landlines. The project, called Bluephone, is being developed with Motorola and Vodafone and will use Bluetooth technology to connect with household telephone lines. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
