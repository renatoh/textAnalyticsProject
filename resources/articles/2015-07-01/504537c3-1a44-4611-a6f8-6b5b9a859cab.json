Hall, born in Glasgow, made 224 appearances for Liverpool between 1969 and 1976, scoring 21 goals and helping the Reds to two league titles, two Uefa Cups and an FA Cup. Tributes have been pouring in for the popular Hall, a university graduate who had come to Liverpool to study a degree in mathematics. He was diagnosed with leukaemia several years ago but had appeared to be winning his battle with the illness. A Liverpool statement read: \u201cLiverpool Football Club is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of former player Brian Hall at the age of 68. One of his finest games for the club came when he played the full match in the 1974 FA Cup final as Bill Shankly\u2019s Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3-0 at Wembley. \u201cBrian also hit a dramatic FA Cup semi-final winner in 1971 when Liverpool beat Merseyside rivals Everton to reach Wembley for the first time since 1965. Brian returned to the club in 1991 to head the club\u2019s public relations department, a role he held until 2011 when he retired through health reasons. \u201cThe thoughts of everyone at Liverpool Football Club go out to his family and friends at this sad time.\u201d His former Liverpool team-mates Terry McDermott and Ray Clemence both paid their tributes on Twitter. McDermott said: \u201cSad to hear the news about Brian Hall, a good player and a great person. Condolences to all of his family.\u201d While Ian Rush added: \u201cRIP Brian Hall \u2013 a truly gent!!\u201d John Aldridge, the chairman of the Liverpool Former Players Association, told the Liverpool Echo: \u201cBrian Hall passed away today, it\u2019s very sad news for all Liverpool fans. What a gentleman and a lovely man. Our thoughts are with his family. You\u2019ll never walk alone Brian.\u201d A statement from the Liverpool FC Official Supporters Club Merseyside branch read: \u201cCommittee members are very sorry to hear of the passing of Brian Hall, known as \u201cBamber\u201d due to his academical achievements \u2013 rare amongst footballers! Brian was always very supportive of our branch, letting us use his office in the attic of the building opposite the Anfield Road stand on a Friday teatime. \u201cHe attended our last branch dinner and seemed to be winning his battle, but sadly it was too great a hurdle to overcome this time. Thanks Brian. YNWA May you rest in peace.\u201d After leaving Liverpool in 1976 Hall enjoyed a brief spell at Plymouth Argyle before spending three years at Burnley until his retirement in 1980."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
