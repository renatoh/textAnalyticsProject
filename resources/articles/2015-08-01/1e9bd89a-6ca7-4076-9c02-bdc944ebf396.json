United have been beaten to the signing of the Spain winger, Pedro, by Chelsea and, amid the noises from Old Trafford that they did not really want him in the end, has been the revelation that they actually might like Man\u00e9. United have made an inquiry to Southampton about him. Koeman, who has a tense relationship with the United manager, Louis van Gaal, spoke out after his team\u2019s 1-1 home draw with FC Midtjylland in the Europa League play-off first leg \u2013 in which Man\u00e9 featured \u2013 and he dropped a strong hint that he suspected underhand work from inside Old Trafford. \u201cWe have to deal about rumours from the press and maybe from Manchester,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 because there is no contact and no bid for nobody and we don\u2019t sell any more players. That is very clear in my opinion. We have to deal with the situation. I don\u2019t like it because maybe players are thinking and they are not then focused on what they have to do. \u201cThe timing is always bad. Maybe it\u2019s worse one day before we play at home but it\u2019s always bad. We keep going. It is not 1 September yet. There are still 10 or 11 days to go, so we will see what happens.\u201d Koeman said that he had spoken to Man\u00e9 about the United situation and he would do so with any of his other players who found themselves in similar positions, including the midfielder, Victor Wanyama, who has been linked with Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cIt is the worst situation for the smaller clubs because nobody talks about the best players of City, United or Chelsea, because they are in the best place to be. But teams like Southampton \u2013 they have to deal with this and that is not easy. It makes rumours and everyone is talking about it. We have to play and that is difficult. If they don\u2019t change the window from 1 September, we will always have these rumours.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
