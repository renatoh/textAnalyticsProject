The absence of the 35-year-old left-arm seamer means that MS Dhoni will lead a squad including only two other players who have previously played Test cricket in England: Gautam Gambhir, the opener who is recalled after an 18-month absence, and the fast bowler Ishant Sharma. There has been a changing of the guard since India\u2019s last Test tour of England in 2011, with the veterans of their batting line-up, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, both retiring. But Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan will doubtless be relishing the opportunity of making an impact in England and they are joined in the squad by some less experienced players among whom there is one familiar surname - Stuart Binny, whose father Roger was the unlikely hero of India\u2019s famous World Cup final victory over West Indies at Lord\u2019s in 1983. India play warm-up games against Leicestershire and Derbyshire before the five Tests are played in rapid succession, starting at Trent Bridge on 9 July. India touring squad: MS Dhoni (capt &amp; wk), M Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Gautam Gambhir, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Ishwar Pandey, Ishant Sharma, Stuart Binny, Varun Aaron, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Pankaj Singh"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
