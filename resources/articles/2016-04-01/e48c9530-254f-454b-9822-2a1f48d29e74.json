First performed in Amman, Jordan, in 2013, Queens of Syria will open at the Young Vic in early July before going to venues in Liverpool, Edinburgh and elsewhere. Fifteen Syrian refugees, who had never acted until they appeared in the great antiwar tragedy by Euripides, will be on stage. For the actors, the tour will allow them to convey their personal tragedies and that of Syria, where a five-year war has left up to 470,000 people dead and millions homeless, precipitating the biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. Maha, one of the women in the play, said: \u201cGoing to London is a very good thing indeed because we can tell the whole world about our home tragedy and of course, in a great country like Britain, the world will listen to us.\u201d Several women have spoken about the therapeutic effects of the play, how it has brought them out of isolation, given them a new identity and family, and provided a sense of renewed purpose. Khaula, another of the actors, said: \u201cWe came to a new society and we were isolated. Doing the play made us break the ice and we started to connect with others and make some friends. It gave us the courage to talk about our problems frankly and clearly.\u201d The play began as workshops with the Syrian director Omar Abusaada for 60 refugee women in Jordan from all walks of life to adapt and perform an Arabic interpretation of the play, which depicts the aftermath of the fall of Troy, when women including Queen Hecuba and children were enslaved by the victorious Greeks. The play was a thinly veiled protest at the brutal suppression by Euripides\u2019s home city of Athens of the independent island of Melos, where all the men were killed and the women and children sold into slavery. Initially, several women faced pressure from some of the more conservative members of their community, who did not want them to go on stage. Differences of opinion emerged within the group itself; some wished to speak out publicly against the Assad government, others not. Others feared the consequences of speaking freely. The UK project is a collaboration between Developing Artists, a charity working to support the arts in countries recovering from conflict, and Refuge Productions, founded by Georgina Paget and husband and wife team Charlotte Eagar and William Stirling. Refuge Productions came up with the original idea of transposing The Trojan Women to the Syrian war. For Eagar, a former journalist who covered the Bosnia war in the 1990s and remembers listening to The Trojan Women on the BBC World Service at the time, the parallels with Syria were obvious. In 2014, the play was performed at the Cern research centre in Geneva and excerpts from a documentary about the production were broadcast to an audience at Georgetown University in Washington DC after the US State Department refused to grant the women visas. Louise Chantal, the chief executive of the Oxford Playhouse, said it was a privilege to bring the project to Oxford. \u201cI can\u2019t help thinking that the Queens of Syria might be the most important theatre project of the year,\u201d she said. To coincide with the UK tour, the British Council will provide material online for thousands of schools in the UK and across the world to enable young people to discuss issues such as exile and trauma, and think about what they can do to welcome refugees. An event is also planned to link students with the cast. Eagar is taken aback that the show is still on the road and struck by how the play and an accompanying documentary by Yasmin Fedda has transformed the women. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if anybody would turn up for the first rehearsal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether it would be any good and thought it would be little more than a superior school play. \u201cBut they recognised the point was to tell their story to the world as they had a sense of being ignored by the world. They felt so abandoned, but are very different now. They have a sense of self-confidence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
