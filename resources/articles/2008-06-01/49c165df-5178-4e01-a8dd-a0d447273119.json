When you have all the information, it's easy to be a genius. I prefer the old-fashioned TV poker style where we only see one player's cards, and must do the same detective work as he is doing. The downside for a commentator, of course, is that you risk looking like an idiot when you guess the opponent's cards wrongly. I commentated on a one-off hand like this in the European Poker Tour grand final from Monte Carlo. Joe Hachem raised with KQ, and was called by Pablo Ubierna on the button. Ubierna was an unknown young Spaniard who had just moved to the table, so his calling range was still unknown. The flop came 9-3-10 and Hachem checked. Ubierna bet - which again doesn't tell us much, because he could just be responding to Hachem's show of weakness - and Hachem called, perhaps planning to bluff it with a check-raise on the turn. But the turn (6) went check-check. Then the river (8) went check check. At that point, I declared confidently that Ubierna must have a small to medium pair. A hand not strong enough to value bet, but not weak enough to bluff. For the check, he must have some showdown value. He must have paired the 9! And sure enough, Ubierna turned over . . . KJ. So much for my credibility. But I still wish that more televised poker was done this way, leaving so much extra room for mystery, suspense and detective work. Meanwhile, Hachem, winning the pot with KQ, was even more surprised than I was."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
