Changing of the Guards (1978) Street Legal delivered fans a shock: Dylan fronting a large band, with female backing singers to the fore. The words, meanwhile, might well represent an oblique personal history, from adolescence through marriage to religious conversion: whatever they were about, they reduced Patti Smith to tears on first hearing. 49. This Wheel\u2019s on Fire (1967) Subsequently covered by everyone from Siouxsie and the Banshees to Kylie Minogue, in every style from psychedelic to electro-glam stomp, the original Basement Tapes recording of This Wheel\u2019s on Fire \u2013 both a great song and another of Dylan\u2019s umpteen apocalyptic visions \u2013 has a uniquely intense, eerie quality that no one else has subsequently matched. 48. Pay in Blood (2012) Should you wonder if Dylan\u2019s capacity for rage had been dulled by his advancing years, listen to Pay in Blood, a gentle musical backdrop for an expression of literally murderous fury: at first he\u2019s so angry that the lyrics are incomprehensible, his voice just a phlegmy snarling noise; when they come into focus, he\u2019s demanding vengeance on bankers and politicians \u201cpumping out [their] piss\u201d. Bracing. 47. My Back Pages (1964) Those upset when Dylan went electric couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t warn them something big was coming: My Back Pages spends the best part of five minutes not repudiating his protest singer past, but bidding the kind of certainties that fuelled it (\u201clies that life is black and white\u201d) a sardonic farewell. 46. Make You Feel My Love (1997) No recent Dylan song has become as ubiquitous as Make You Feel My Love, its status as a modern standard largely down to Adele\u2019s cover version. The original is noticeably darker in tone, largely because it\u2019s sung by Dylan in his fearsome latter-day rasp, but its powerful cocktail of beautifully direct lyrics and indelible melody are irresistible. 45. Went to See the Gypsy (1970) This fabulous (perhaps imaginary) account of meeting Elvis casts Dylan in the unlikely role of awestruck fan and imbues Presley with mystical powers (\u201che can \u2026 drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror\u201d) capable of restoring another artist\u2019s creativity: following their meeting, Dylan has \u201cmusic in [his] ears\u201d. 44. Blowin\u2019 in the Wind (1963) Apparently written in a matter of minutes, its melody borrowed from No More Auction Block \u2013 a civil war-era spiritual performed by Dylan and Odetta \u2013 Blowin\u2019 in the Wind may be Dylan\u2019s most famous protest song precisely because, as he pointed out, it\u2019s not a protest song: it deals in universalities rather than specifics, making it infinitely adaptable. 43. Ain\u2019t Talkin\u2019 (2006) The conclusion of Modern Times brought more brooding horror \u2013 violence, plague, unending suffering \u2013 with an opening line that made it sound like an old folk ballad (\u201cas I walked out \u2026\u201d) and a twist that the song\u2019s protagonist isn\u2019t just a dismayed observer, but potentially something much worse: his heart occupied by \u201can evil spirit\u201d, he ends the song confronting a lone woman. 42. One Too Many Mornings (1964) A respite from the firebrand finger-pointing that comprises much of The Times They Are A-Changing, the moving One Too Many Mornings finds Dylan reflecting on the complex end of his relationship with Suze Rotolo: \u201cIt\u2019s a restless hungry feeling that don\u2019t mean no one no good/When everything I\u2019m saying, you can say it just as good\u201d. 41. Forever Young (1974) Written \u201cin a minute\u201d, there\u2019s a strong argument that the best version of Dylan\u2019s universal description of the emotions of fatherhood is the original demo: the reason he eventually allowed a lo-fi and incomplete recording to be released is that there is a rawness and emotional punch to it that the two takes on 1974\u2019s Planet Waves never quite match. 40. Jokerman (1983) The Mark Knopfler-produced Infidels divided critical opinion, but everyone seemed to agree its opening track was great \u2013 a complex lyric underpinned with Sly and Robbie\u2019s subtle reggae rhythm. The best version, however, is the scorching one Dylan performed on David Letterman\u2019s TV show with new wave band the Plugz, a tantalising glimpse of an alternative route through the 80s he chose not to take. 39. The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019 (1964) The title track of Dylan\u2019s third album was genuinely incendiary, a call to action that is more about identifying a generational divide that would turn into a gulf as the 60s progressed than any specific cause: \u201cCome mothers and fathers throughout the land, and don\u2019t criticise what you can\u2019t understand.\u201d 38. Love Minus Zero/No Limit (1965) \u201cThat wasn\u2019t like any pop music I\u2019ve heard,\u201d offered one dissenting voice amid the disappointed folkies interviewed after a 1966 Sheffield Dylan gig. The dissenter had a point: that Dylan was reshaping pop in his own image is underlined by Love Minus Zero/No Limit, a gorgeously tuneful love song with lyrics richer than any previous love song. 37. If Not For You (1970) More appealing than his hit anthem of husbandly devotion, Lay Lady Lay, If Not For You offers nothing to unravel, no mystery, nothing you could write an extended literary essay about, just directness and emotional connection. It is, to use a phrase not often appended to Dylan\u2019s work, catchy. 36. Knockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door (1973) Knockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door\u2019s elevation to all-purpose air-punching rock anthem \u2013 most notably in Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 preposterously overwrought cover \u2013 was perhaps to be expected given its chorus, but there\u2019s a sense the song itself gets trampled in the process: you are better off with the simplicity and haunted, echoey ambience of Dylan\u2019s original. 35. Slow Train (1979) A complicated business: the most controversial of Dylan\u2019s born again songs \u2013 occasionally, the lyrics sail perilously close to rightwing religious fundamentalism \u2013 also happens to be the best. There\u2019s a tautness to the music that undercuts the slick production, real drama and conviction in the vocal delivery that shifts from rage to a kind of joy at the coming of judgment day. 34. Brownsville Girl (1986) The largely rotten Knocked Out Loaded suggested Dylan was in trouble. Yet he could, occasionally, come up with the goods: co-written with playwright Sam Shepard, Brownsville Girl offers 17 weirdly conversational sung-spoken verses that ruminate on everything from his ongoing writer\u2019s block to Gregory Peck, and which include a poignant Dylan aphorism: \u201cPeople who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content.\u201d 33. Murder Most Foul (2020) Dylan\u2019s longest song appeared without warning, in the midst of the coronavirus lockdown. Its meditation on the death of JFK, packed with enough cultural references to keep fans busy until restrictions are lifted, was more of a recitation set to music than a song, unlike anything he had previously recorded: evidence that, nearing 80, the old boy keeps pushing forward. 32. It\u2019s All Over Now Baby Blue (1965) Bringing It All Back Home ended with a song in the vein of Another Side\u2019s finale, It Ain\u2019t Me Babe. Once again, it isn\u2019t entirely clear whether Dylan is bidding farewell to a lover or the chunk of his fanbase who wanted him to stay as he was. Either way, it ends with a robust memo-to-self: \u201cStrike another match, go start anew\u201d. 31. Isis (1976) There\u2019s a theory that the chorus-free Isis tells the allegorical story of Dylan\u2019s attempts to patch up his marriage (\u201cwhat drives me to you,\u201d he glumly suggests, \u201cis what drives me insane\u201d), but whatever it\u2019s about, it\u2019s amazingly forceful, its travelogue driven relentlessly forward by Scarlet Rivera\u2019s violin and the power of Dylan\u2019s vocal. 30. High Water (For Charlie Patton) (2001) The highlight of Love and Theft feels like a distant relation to 1983\u2019s Blind Willie McTell \u2013 another powerful travelogue inspired by a legendary bluesman, its refrain taken from Patton\u2019s High Water Everywhere \u2013 although the tone is noticeably more ominous, the odd flash of humour (\u201cjump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard\u201d) deeply incongruous. 29. Don\u2019t Think Twice It\u2019s Alright (1963) Ironically, Dylan\u2019s paean to Suze Rotolo \u2013 away in Italy when he devised its perfectly-done balance of tenderness and acrimony \u2013 helped end their relationship for good: when Rotolo heard Joan Baez introduce it onstage as a song \u201cabout a love affair that has lasted too long\u201d, it prompted her to leave him. 28. All Along the Watchtower (1967) Dylan thought Jimi Hendrix\u2019s cover of All Along the Watchtower was so definitive that he subsequently started playing it live in Hendrix\u2019s style. But there\u2019s a lot to be said for Dylan\u2019s humble original, its brevity and starkness capturing the same end-times intensity in a different way. 27. Most of the Time (1989) Most of the Time both demonstrates how much producer Daniel Lanois had to do with Dylan\u2019s best 80s album Oh Mercy \u2013 the sound is rich, shimmering and atmospheric \u2013 and how Dylan himself had recovered from an artistic slump: the lyrical drawing of the emotional fallout from a failed relationship is both sharp and sensitive, his delivery perfectly judged. 26. I Want You (1966) The last song recorded for Blonde on Blonde features a parade of intriguing characters \u2013 the \u201cdancing child\u201d is supposedly Rolling Stone Brian Jones \u2013 but, by the standards of Dylan\u2019s songwriting at the time, it\u2019s straightforward: a buoyant, utterly charming declaration of love on which his Nashville band once more prove their worth. The guitar playing in particular is a joy. 25. Simple Twist of Fate (1975) Dylan professed to be horrified that people liked Blood on the Tracks (\u201cenjoying that kind of pain,\u201d he complained). But regardless of its backstory, who couldn\u2019t love Simple Twist of Fate? Genius at full throttle, it\u2019s got everything \u2013 a naggingly infectious melody, an impassioned vocal and incredible lyrics that depict his marriage collapsing in the third person. 24. Hurricane (1976) The plight of imprisoned boxer Reuben Carter drove Dylan back to writing protest songs: Hurricane is as detailed, hard-hitting and journalistic as The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll. There\u2019s a real tension between his snarling voice and the song\u2019s appealing melody, a shattering force about its lyrics: \u201cIf you\u2019re black you might as well not show up on the street, unless you wanna draw the heat\u201d. 23. I Shall Be Released (1967) Among the most-covered of Dylan\u2019s songs (even the Beatles had a crack at it) I Shall Be Released ended up a rousing singalong protest anthem, but it\u2019s the original, largely unadorned version on The Basement Tapes Raw that best captures its real power: a hymn-like song not about literal imprisonment but transcending physical existence. 22. Chimes of Freedom (1964) The title makes Chimes of Freedom sound like a protest song, but it\u2019s something else entirely, a vivid, poetic recounting of a storm (\u201cthe sky cracked its poems in naked wonder \u2026 the rain unravelled tales\u201d) that seems to have provoked an epiphany in its author: a dazzling signpost to where Dylan was headed. 21. I Threw It All Away (1969) Nashville Skyline\u2019s greatest song. Exceptionally beautiful, incredibly sad and the antithesis of the Dylan of three years prior \u2013 his voice doesn\u2019t even sound like his own \u2013 I Threw It All Away is uncluttered, straightforward, fluid: its beauty comes from its simplicity rather than its density. 20. A Hard Rain\u2019s A Gonna Fall (1963) In response to the Cuban missile crisis, A Hard Rain\u2019s A-Gonna Fall \u201croared right out the typewriter\u201d in the words of a friend who watched Dylan write it. Furthermore, he recorded it in one take: a torrent of apocalyptic imagery so potent it long outlived the moment it was supposed to soundtrack. 19. The Groom\u2019s Still Waiting at the Altar (1981) Dylan\u2019s 80s were marked by some weird decisions about album track listings, which begin here: what possessed him to leave this ferocious slice of blues-rock off Shot of Love? It\u2019s superb, its edge-of-chaos rowdiness and sheer passion in his vocal making it a counterpart to the music on Highway 61 Revisited. 18. Mr Tambourine Man (1965) A leftover from Another Side of Bob Dylan that signposted his future even more dramatically than Chimes of Freedom, Mr Tambourine Man\u2019s tumble of free-associating imagery immediately got it pegged as a drug song, but it\u2019s more about the act of writing itself, a joyous paean to the moment the muse takes over. 17. Ballad of a Thin Man (1965) No character in a Dylan song has inspired so much conjecture as Ballad of a Thin Man\u2019s poor old Mr Jones: who on earth could have inspired such an unrelenting outpouring of bile? Perhaps it doesn\u2019t matter: better not to worry about the subject and just luxuriate \u2013 if that\u2019s the word \u2013 in its doom-laden sound and the fizzing intensity of Dylan\u2019s delivery. 16. One of Us Must Know (Sooner Or Later) (1966) A postmatch analysis of a love affair gone wrong, One of Us Must Know is the negative image of the \u201cnasty\u201d songs in which Dylan had come to specialise: he sounds apologetic (at least most of the time) rather than apoplectic; its fantastic chorus, driven by Al Kooper\u2019s organ, feels somewhere between a surge of energy and a sigh. 15. It\u2019s Alright Ma (I\u2019m Only Bleeding) (1965) A song containing a plethora of justly celebrated Dylan aphorisms \u2013 \u201cHe not busy being born is busy dying\u201d is perhaps the greatest \u2013 It\u2019s Alright Ma (I\u2019m Only Bleeding) is a gripping, furious explosion of apocalyptic imagery that posits the timeless theory that politicians and the media offer a false sense of reality. 14. Things Have Changed (1997) Dylan\u2019s superb, Oscar-winning contribution to the soundtrack of Wonder Boys finds him \u2013 not for the first or last time \u2013 casting a jaundiced eye over a world he feels out of step with, its insistent, shuffling music a backdrop for a series of vibrant portents of impending doom, all dismissed with a grouchy shrug: \u201cI used to care but things have changed.\u201d 13. The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll (1964) Arguably the most powerful of all Dylan\u2019s protest songs, Hattie Carroll occasionally plays fast and loose with the facts of the racist murder it describes, but its combination of journalistic reportage and poetic technique is astonishing: the fact that it\u2019s measured, unhysterical and unsentimental in tone makes it all the more impactful. 12. Tangled Up in Blue (1975) You could include anything or everything from Blood on the Tracks in a list such as this: spurred by the failure of his marriage, his muse was working overtime, as evidenced by its astonishing opening track, a fragmentary, unreliably narrated recollection of a failed relationship that shifts erratically from one scene to another, like a dream. 11. Girl From the North Country (1963) Perhaps the loveliest of Dylan\u2019s early love songs, Girl From the North County is a remembrance of an old girlfriend \u2013 exactly which one is the subject of a quite insane level of debate \u2013 suffused with nostalgia and regret, on which the starkness of The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan\u2019s sound is transformed into hushed, small-hours reflection. 10. It Ain\u2019t Me Babe (1964) In which another kiss-off to Suze Rotolo \u2013 who frankly receives a bit of a raw deal in the lyrics \u2013 gets mixed up with Dylan waving his voice of a generation tag goodbye. It\u2019s unclear throughout whether he is addressing his ex or his audience, although the fact it concludes his last acoustic album lends strength to the latter interpretation. 9. Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands (1966) Dylan considered Sad Eyed Lady important enough to devote a whole side of rock\u2019s first double album to it, as if it needed to stand alone. He subsequently couldn\u2019t decide if it was an 11-minute masterpiece, or him \u201cjust [getting] carried away\u201d: listening to its understated sound, cyclical melody and devotional lyrics, it\u2019s hard not to cleave to the former interpretation. 8. Not Dark Yet (1997) The sound of a 56-year-old man facing up to mortality, Not Dark Yet developed a chilling prescience when its author nearly died of pericarditis before it was released. But Not Dark Yet doesn\u2019t need a spooky backstory. It succeeds entirely on its own merits: gloomy, thoughtful and occasionally blackly comic, it was one reason why Time Out of Mind was acclaimed as a masterpiece. 7. Positively Fourth Street (1965) Boasting one of the great stop-you-in-your-tracks opening lines \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of nerve \u2026\u201d \u2013 Positively Fourth Street\u2019s sneering excoriation of the Greenwich Village folk scene feels like eavesdropping on a particularly savage argument: so vicious you feel guilty for listening in, so compelling you can\u2019t help yourself. 6. Blind Willie McTell (1983) Another track Dylan bafflingly discarded, this aching, vivid, unflinching acoustic conjuring of the old South the titular bluesman inhabited \u2013 equal parts beauty and injustice \u2013 was instantly and rightly acclaimed as one of his greatest songs when it finally appeared on the 1991 Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 box set. 5. Desolation Row (1965) In the mid-60s Dylan complained that he had never written anything as \u201cfar out\u201d as the strangest folk ballads, but on Desolation Row, he succeeded in taking the ballad form to a completely new place. It\u2019s a cliche to compare it to TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land, but it fits: 11 stark minutes of oppressive, absurd imagery that never slackens its grip on the listener despite its length. 4. Subterranean Homesick Blues (1965) Everyone knows that the release of Subterranean Homesick Blues was a pivotal moment in rock history. More startling is how explosive it still sounds, 55 years away from the furore about Dylan \u201cgoing electric\u201d and the emergent counterculture the song seemed to embody: the relentless staccato vocal barrage, the lyrical fireworks, the chaotic racket kicked up by the backing musicians. Endlessly imitated, never equalled. 3. Idiot Wind (1975) On one level an outpouring of fury to rival anything his amphetamine-fuelled younger self came up with, yet Idiot Wind differs from Ballad of a Thin Man or Positively Fourth Street in that its author isn\u2019t just hurling bitter accusations, he\u2019s writhing in agony: \u201cI haven\u2019t known peace and quiet for so long I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like.\u201d The end result is extraordinary, harrowing listening. 2 Visions of Johanna (1966) Like a Rolling Stone may have been more revolutionary, but Visions of Johanna has a strong claim to be Dylan\u2019s greatest song, a parade of luminous symbolism that manages to be both mystifying and incredibly potent (\u201cThe ghost of electricity howls through the bones of her face\u201d). His Nashville backing band, meanwhile, sounds perfect: subtle but insistent, the small-hours setting of the lyrics seeping into the sound. 1. Like a Rolling Stone (1965) Let it be known that ranking Bob Dylan\u2019s 50 best songs is not a relaxing diversion to pass one\u2019s lockdown time. It\u2019s a supremely frustrating exercise that can only end with you looking agog at the songs you have left out, your face crumpling into a WTF? expression. As for No 1, sometimes you have to bow to the inevitable. In its author\u2019s own words, Like a Rolling Stone changed it all: six minutes of \u201csteady hatred\u201d, its chorus melody loosely based on Ritchie Valens\u2019 La Bamba, its musicians \u2013 as writer Greil Marcus has pointed out \u2013 just clinging on to the song by their fingernails, it was a boundary-breaking single that permanently altered the face of music. Entire books have been written about it, unravelling meanings from its dense lyrics, but Marcus\u2019s point is key: along with the sheer venom of Dylan\u2019s delivery, it\u2019s the sense that the journey into uncharted territory is permanently on the brink of collapse that makes it so eternally thrilling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
