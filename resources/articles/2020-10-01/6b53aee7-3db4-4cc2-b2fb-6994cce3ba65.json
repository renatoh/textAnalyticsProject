Trump trails Joe Biden in most national and battleground state polls. Democrats hold the House of Representatives and expect to keep it, while many forecasters think they have a good chance of re-taking the Senate, which Republicans hold 53-47, thereby achieving unified government. \u201cI think the Senate is tough actually,\u201d the Washington Post said Trump told donors in Nashville, Tennessee, on Thursday, before his last debate against Biden, according to an anonymous attendee. \u201cThe Senate is very tough.\u201d The Post said Trump also insisted Republicans \u201care going to take back the House\u201d. As Democrats hold that chamber by 232-197, few forecasters think there is much chance of that. Senate Republicans face defeat in Colorado, Maine, Arizona and perhaps North Carolina. Supposedly safer seats in Georgia, Iowa and Montana look far from secure. Trump reportedly told donors North Carolina would hold and Alabama would be taken back, but said there were \u201ca couple\u201d of senators he did not want to help. \u201cThere are a couple senators I can\u2019t really get involved in,\u201d the Post quoted him as saying. \u201cI just can\u2019t do it. You lose your soul if you do. I can\u2019t help some of them. I don\u2019t want to help some of them.\u201d Trump has clashed with senators including Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who offered harsh criticism and predicted \u201ca Republican bloodbath in the Senate\u201d. Sasse is among conservatives eyeing post-Trump presidential runs. Others usually loyal but under pressure at the polls, such as John Cornyn in Texas and Martha McSally in Arizona, have mounted cautious bids to be seen as independent. Even Mitch McConnell, the ruthless architect of the Republicans\u2019 push to install federal judges under Trump, has said he thinks his party has a \u201c50-50\u201d chance of keeping control. The majority leader, 78, set for re-election despite a tough fight in Kentucky, has rebuffed questions about his health after he appeared with severe bruising to his hands and face. Control of the Senate has allowed Republicans to rush through the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the supreme court, thereby tipping it 6-3 in favour of conservatives. If the White House and Senate are lost, a reactionary court would be Republicans\u2019 bulwark against a Biden legislative agenda that could include reform to the court and the Senate. The court is due to hear a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, on 10 November. Trump has said he wants the justices to bring the ACA down, thereby depriving millions of healthcare in a pandemic and kneecapping his own drive to defeat HIV. One senator who initially stood against the push for Barrett said during debate on Saturday she would vote to confirm. When the nomination comes to the floor on Monday, said Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, \u201cI will be a yes. I have no doubt about her intellect \u2026 I have no doubt about her capability to do the job.\u201d Generally a defender of abortion rights Democrats say Barrett will threaten, Murkowksi had said no new justice should be named before the election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
