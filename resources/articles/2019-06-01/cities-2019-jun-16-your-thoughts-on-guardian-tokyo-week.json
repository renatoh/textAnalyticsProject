We explored in depth whether next year\u2019s Olympics can live up to the 1964 games, how Tokyo is bracing itself for its next once-in-a century earthquake, and how life is changing for women in the city. We asked you for your thoughts on how the city\u2019s changed, and for your comments on our coverage. Here\u2019s what you told us: \u2018What is so great about Tokyo \u201cfinally opening up\u201d?\u2019 In response to our report by the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, on whether the city is opening up to the outside world, Lou, who has lived in Tokyo for 20 years, said: Tokyo is changing, but not for the better. Many old, beautiful traditions are dying out. Young people aren\u2019t upholding them. English is infiltrating and the result is not good \u2013 the Japanese language is chock full of random, annoying English words. Mass immigration will be the nail in the coffin. Japan will be \u2018globalised\u2019 and its traditions relegated to tourist spots. Why do we want Tokyo to be like London? What is so great about Tokyo \u2018finally opening up\u2019? The whole world is becoming a homogenous lump. Where will the tourists go then?\u201d On social media we asked readers to share their hopes and fears for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. @kakiandbambino said he hoped no-one - players, staff or spectators \u2013 dies due to heatstroke. \u2018An environmental disaster\u2019 The Guardian\u2019s athetics correspondent, Sean Ingle, reported from the city on whether Tokyo 2020 can live up to 1964\u2019s Olympic legacy: \u201cSuch was the event\u2019s success that it has set the bar dazzlingly high for Tokyo 2020.\u201d Toby Miller got in touch to highlight the darker side of those games. He said the 1964 Tokyo Olympics was \u201can environmental and human, classic Cold-War disaster\u201d. Miller, author of Greenwashing Sport, describes environment destruction caused by the construction of the high-speed rail link between Osaka and Tokyo. The canals, sea, and rivers below the railway were inundated with concrete and landfill, and a centuries-old field of seaweed destroyed. Water stagnated, sludge emerged, and sea life perished. Estuaries turned into cesspools and/or were transformed into roads. The tramway system was virtually destroyed in favor of freeways and cars became dominant. Clearance of living things saw hundreds of thousands of homeless cats and dogs killed by the state. As with all very rapid, massive modernizations, from the US through the Soviet Union to China, this transformation was achieved through violence; in this case, the horror of war and its detritus, followed by preferential Cold-War terms.\u201d \u2018Tokyo\u2019s Floating Stadium\u2019 Mid-week a curious email landed in our inbox. The subject line was \u201cTokyo\u2019s Floating Stadium\u201d, and it was sent from Florian Busch Architects, in Shibuya-ku. It announced: After several plans to build a new National Stadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo had been cancelled, the embarrassment was redeemed by an almost happy ending. In July of 2020, the New National Stadium, a ship, anchored under Odaiba\u2019s Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo became the first host of an era of a newfound Olympic spirit.\u201d This \u201cfloating stadium\u201d was a groundbreaking architectural feat that would travel the world, from one Olympic city to the next. It also wasn\u2019t real, but in fact an elaborate tease devised by the architect firm \u201cin response to the mess surrounding the Olympic stadium\u201d. \u2018Japanese academia is more open to non-Japanese professors\u2019 We asked readers to share their thoughts about how Tokyo was changing. Laurence Williams, associate professor in the Faculty of Foreign Studies at Sophia University, a private university in Chiyoda ward in central Tokyo, said: Japanese academia is much more open to non-Japanese professors than it used to be. Tokyo itself is diverse and exciting and this is a great time to be working in the city. Numbers of international students are rising sharply (because of demographic decline, universities are increasingly looking abroad). Most international students are still from elsewhere in Asia, although US/UK/Europe numbers are rising.\u201d Old Japan and new Japan Susannah, who lives in Shibuya, sent in this photo of the Imperial Palace from across the water, and writes: \u201cThis is just after New Years, and shows an impressive contrast between nature, old Japan, and new Japan.\u201d \u2018Is this racism? Yes, but not, I think, in a straightforward way\u2019 David Chart wrote in to say that he served on Kawasaki City committees dealing with issues affecting foreign residents, and reckons the treatment of them hasn\u2019t changed. A couple of years ago he helped organise a survey of foreign residents living in Kawasaki to find out problems they were facing. In a blogpost at the time about the survey results, he said the Japanese police occasionally single out foreigners due to their race, and ask them questions, and \u201csometimes they make them call their mothers\u201d. He told Guardian Cities: \u201cThe composition of the foreign population has changed a lot even while I have been here, but the problems they face have changed much less. Is this racism? Yes, but not, I think, in a straightforward way. \u2018Central housing estates are experiencing a renaissance\u2019 On Tuesday we published an investigation by Guardian Cities and the Waseda Chronicle into how Tokyo\u2019s suburban housing became vast ghettoes for elderly people. Reader Lewis Parley wrote in to say: Your article about the aging population of Tokyo\u2019s suburban housing estates was very informative. I think it would be beneficial to the series if you contrast this phenomenon with the renaissance some more central public housing estates are experiencing due to the influx of immigrant families ( Chinese in Kawaguchi, Indian/ Bangladeshi in Ojima, Koto-ku and Kasai, Edogawa-ku). By also featuring these places, I think you\u2019d give the reader a more balanced picture of the changes Tokyo\u2019s population is experiencing.\u201d During the week, people shared photos of their favourite and suprising Tokyo scenes on Twitter and Instagram, such as these posts: \u2018It had become a building site\u2019 Trevor Skingle got in touch to describe the tension he\u2019d observed between modernisation, and the desire to preserve the city\u2019s heritage. Take for instance the old \u2018Habutae Dango\u2019 that was located near Nippori Station with its 200-year-old history as a tea house and dango (sweet dumpling shop), a favourite haunt of the poet Masaoka Shiki and the author Natsume Soseki, and repository of a few Shogitai relics from the 1868 Battle of Ueno. Each time I visited Tokyo I would make a point of visiting to enjoy their dango and matcha green tea whilst at the same time contemplating the wonderful garden view available only to patrons only to find on my visit in 2018 that it had become a building site.\u201d On the other hand, he adds: \u201cAs a Tokyo history buff I am astonished at some of the historical finds that I\u2019ve made which are still there.\u201d Guardian Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.
