Koppenhaver was convicted by a Las Vegas jury in March of 29 felonies after he attacked Christy Mack and her male friend Corey Thomas. He had found Mack and Thomas together in her bedroom. At sentencing Mack told District Judge Elissa Cadish that she fears Koppenhaver will kill her if he is released. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my life will feel complete in 12 years or 30 years and neither do you, but I do know when he gets out he will kill me,\u201d Mack said. She suffered a lacerated liver, broken rib and lost two teeth during the assault. Koppenhaver, 35, will be eligible for parole when he is 71. \u201cI should have killed myself by now. There\u2019s no reason right now that I shouldn\u2019t be in the dirt right now laying next to Aaron Hernandez. That\u2019s 100% true,\u201d Koppenhaver said in his statement. Hernandez, the former NFL star, killed himself in prison in April while serving a life sentence for murder. Koppenhaver said anxiety and depression were to blame for his behavior, but claims he has changed since finding God in prison. \u201cNot a day goes by that I don\u2019t seriously regret all those things that I did. I was a very, very lost, very empty person,\u201d Koppenhaver added in his statement. \u201cAnd to top it off, something\u2019s not right with my head. Plain and simple. I\u2019ve known that a long time and I\u2019ve hated it. I\u2019ve hated the way that I think. I\u2019ve hated my impulses. Half the time, I don\u2019t know why I do some the things I do. And some of the times I do things and I don\u2019t even feel like I did them until it\u2019s already done.\u201d Koppenhaver fought in 19 MMA fights, winning 14. He also worked as a pornographic actor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
