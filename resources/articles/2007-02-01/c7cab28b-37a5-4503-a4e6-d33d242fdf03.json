Lord Goldsmith has come under attack over his advice on the legality of the Iraq war, the decision to end a Serious Fraud Office inquiry into corruption in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and on whether he should have a role in deciding whether prosecutions should be launched in the cash for honours inquiry. Ms Harman will say in a speech on Saturday: \"It is a contradiction in terms to have an accountable office-holder who is not able to publish to those whom he is accountable the advice he has given. It is not enough for government ministers to say we are advised that it is lawful. Backbenchers, let alone the wider public, want to see for themselves what the arguments are.\" It is a longstanding government convention that all legal advice of the attorney general is kept confidential. Mr Blair fought a long battle to keep Lord Goldsmith's evolving advice on the invasion of Iraq from the public, but was forced to publish extracts following leaks. Ms Harman rejects the idea that the attorney's role, steeped in 500 years of history, is so contradictory that he should no longer be a member of the government, and instead become independent. The view has been aired privately by the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer. The attorney's independence and role is also under consideration by Gordon Brown and MPs on the constitutional affairs select committee. Ms Harman, a former solicitor general, will concede in her speech that the attorney \"wears a number of different hats at any one time, including legal adviser to government, legal adviser to parliament, lead minister to the prosecutions service, decision maker in certain cases, including consents to prosecution and referring unduly lenient sentences to the court of appeal\". She will say: \"In these different roles the attorney general and solicitor general sometimes have to act quasi-judicially in the public interest. And in other aspects of their role they act as a minister and a member of the government.\" Ms Harman will say that the issue is not so much whether an individual is capable of acting in the public interest, as opposed to the government interest, but whether the public in these distrustful times believe the attorney can make such a separation. The only reasons for non-disclosure of advice should be \"an individual's personal privacy, matters under criminal investigation, commercial confidentiality or national security. \"For public trust to be maximised, secrecy must be minimised. This is not just a question of public confidence. The belief behind our commitment to the freedom of information is not just the public are entitled to know what is done in their name and at their expense, but also that decisions that are made publicly and for which the decision maker is accountable are likely to be more thoughtful and better quality decisions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
