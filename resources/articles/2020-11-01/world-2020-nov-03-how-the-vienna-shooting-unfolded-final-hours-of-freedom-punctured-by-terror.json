The weather was mild, and as the hours ticked down before a nationwide coronavirus curfew largely shut down the city for a month, the bars and restaurants of the \u201cBermuda triangle\u201d \u2013 a network of narrow, fashionable lanes in the old city\u2019s 1st district \u2013 were busy. Diners and drinkers sat at tables outside, enjoying a last moment of revelry before another pandemic lockdown amid the full blast of winter. Without warning, at 8pm on Seitenstettengasse, a winding cobbled boulevard a block back from the Danube Canal, the shooting started. \u201cThey were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,\u201d Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister recalled in the aftermath of the attacks that have left at least two civilians and one suspected attacker dead. He told reporters he saw, from his window above Vienna\u2019s main synagogue, at least one person shooting at people sitting outside in the street. \u201cAll these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cAs of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month, and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.\u201d Another witness told Austria\u2019s public broadcaster ORF that a gunman had started to fire at random at groups of people sitting at tables. \u201cIt sounded like firecrackers, then we realised it was shots,\u201d they said. The shooter \u201cshot wildly with an automatic weapon\u201d before police arrived and opened fire. Footage purportedly showing the attack and shared by European counter-terrorism officers showed a puddle of blood by the entrance of a restaurant. Another unconfirmed clip showed a man carrying a rifle and wearing a white shirt and beige trousers firing shots towards a building. A male voice can be heard swearing at the suspected attacker from one of the buildings. The shooting quickly spread to what police said were six different locations nearby. At least four people have been killed \u2013 one of them an attacker shot dead outside St Rupert\u2019s church, carrying an assault rifle and handguns, his body strung with an explosives vest and a bag of ammunition. Police later said the vest was fake. A further 15 people were taken to hospital injured, seven of them reportedly critical. \u201cWe are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital that is still ongoing,\u201d Austria\u2019s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said hours after the gunfire erupted. Video footage of the attack appeared to show only a single attacker, though on Monday night officials believed it was possible that several perpetrators were still on the loose. \u201cThey seem to also, as far as we know, be very well equipped, with automatic weapons,\u201d said Kurz. \u201cSo they were very well-prepared.\u201d \u2018We were in shock\u2019 Chris Zhao, a student, was in a restaurant on Seitenstettengasse when the attack took place. He told the BBC he heard between 20 and 30 bangs that sounded like firecrackers shortly after 8pm. The manager locked the door to the restaurant at first, but when he left, Zhao says he saw several people injured and one body. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in shock.\u201d Gernot Gruber, a 25-year-old student, was caught in the Hard Rock cafe, less than 100 metres from the first attack outside the synagogue. He initially thought the bangs he heard outside were fireworks. \u201cIf you hear these noises in Austria you don\u2019t think they\u2019re gunshots, you really don\u2019t,\u201d he told the Guardian. Restaurant staff locked the doors and told people to get away from the windows before special forces police entered the building and told everyone to leave, and run towards Schwedenplatz, away from the initial attack. Gruber said that when they emerged from the cafe, they saw police on the street corners pointing their weapons. Once the crowd had arrived at Schwedenplatz, the police asked them to raise their hands and to show they were not carrying weapons. \u201cThat is the first time police ever aimed at me with their guns,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that this is an experience that almost nobody who lives here has ever had before. I\u2019ve been to several countries and have heard and watched about these attacks. But I\u2019ve never been close to one. It was really frightening.\u201d Lea, who only gave her first name, lives in the neighbouring 2nd district of Vienna. She said she normally spends evenings in the bustling quarter targeted by the gunman. Instead, she was at home as helicopters circled overhead. \u201cThe situation right now is really scary, my phone is ringing all the time because everyone is so worried. It\u2019s heartbreaking. Hopefully the police can find all of the shooters and no more people have to die. But she said the Viennese would \u201crise stronger than ever\u201d. \u201cThere is no place here for terrorism, neither left, right or from a religious point of view. There is a reason why everyone is saying \u2018Wien ist anders\u2019 [Vienna is different].\u201d As the night wore on, Vienna was placed under a new kind of lockdown. Office workers were told to sleep overnight in their buildings, while restaurants were shut and barricaded. Patrons at cinemas, the opera and theatres were held inside for hours before it was declared safe for them to go home. At the sold-out State Opera, about 1,000 spectators were informed of the attack when the director, Bogdan Roscic, stepped out in front of the stage curtain. They were eventually escorted out of the building at 11.45pm, nearly four hours after the attack began. By then public transport was not stopping in the 1st district, and taxis would not come into the quarter, making the journey home long and difficult for many. The motive for the assault remains under investigation, but by Tuesday morning, the interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said he was \u201ccertain\u201d the attack has an Islamist motive. The gunman shot by police on Monday night is understood to be a 20-year-old with dual Austrian-Northern Macedonian citizenship, who had on 25 April 2019 been handed a 22-month prison sentence for trying to travel to Syria to join Islamic State. He was released early, in December 2019, in keeping with Austrian law covering the rights of young people. Kurz praised the police for killing one of the suspected attackers and vowed: \u201cWe will not never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
