A Turkish official said yesterday that more than 1,000 troops took part in the offensive. And the foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, again urged the US to take action against Turkish Kurd bases across the border. More than 20 soldiers or policemen have been killed since June 1, when the rebels called off a ceasefire declared in 1999 after the capture of their leader, Abdullah Ocalan. The PKK began a war for autonomy in 1984 that has left 37,000 dead. Turkey has ruled out talks with the PKK, considered a terrorist organisation by the US state department and the European Union. Turkish officials say some of the increase in violence could be due to PKK splits between those advocating a political struggle for autonomy and those favouring a return to arms. Turkey is home to an estimated 12 million Kurds. Mr Gul said the intensification of attacks was a sign of a \"panicking group on the brink of a breakup\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
