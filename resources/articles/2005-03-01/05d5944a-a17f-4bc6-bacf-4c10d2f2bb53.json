Fossett said the failure of his plane GlobalFlyer's satellite navigation system (GPS) in the early hours of this morning was \"a showstopper\" for the 80-hour flight. After a discussion with his sponsor and friend, Sir Richard Branson, Fossett decided to continue the flight, relying on mission control and the \"chase plane\" following him around the world for help with steering and positioning. But Fossett did not underestimate the seriousness of the problem. \"This really was a big worry since we are unable to fly without GPS, especially when out of radio range, we couldn't even be directed by air traffic control. It was essential that the GPS be recovered.\" Two hours later there were sighs of relief in mission control when the GPS re-engaged, fixing the problem and allowing Fossett to navigate for himself. The exact cause of the glitch has not been identified, but GlobalFlyer's engineers believe interference from the plane's other electrical equipment may have been to blame. Once those tense two hours were over, the flight has continued according to plan, said project director Paul Moore. After 18 hours and 13 minutes of flying, Fossett had travelled 6,400 miles and was flying over the Algeria-Libya border at 2,000ft above his predicted maximum altitude of 45,000ft. He will reach the halfway point as he flies over India in approximately 12 hours. GlobalFlyer took off at 6.47pm local time (0047GMT) last night - just after sunset - from an airfield in the small city of Salina, Kansas, watched by an estimated 10,000 onlookers and more than 100 journalists from around the world. The GlobalFlyer team raced to prepare the plane for takeoff after turbulence and unfavourable winds earlier that afternoon prevented the aircraft from taking off, leaving a window of just 25 minutes before the light faded completely. Speaking live at a press conference at 8am local time this morning from his 7ft cockpit, the GlobalFlyer pilot said: \"The flight is going very well. I am happy. There's going to be some beautiful scenery. I just crossed Madeira about 15 minutes ago.\" A Citation X chase plane, which can travel at nine-tenths the speed of sound, is making rendezvous with Fossett's plane at points throughout the trip. The two planes came into view of one another just off the coast of Morocco. Will Whitehorn, who was on board the Citation X as it accompanied GlobalFlyer, said: \"The aircraft looked like a beautiful swallow against the Atlas Mountains. Steve was on very good form ... he is very optimistic about the flight. He had a little bit of a rest when he was flying over the Atlantic.\" If all goes to plan, Fossett will land back where he started in Kansas some time on Thursday morning, notching up another record to add to his clutch of more than 60 firsts. Fossett is used to grappling with technological hitches during his numerous endurance feats, not least his around the world balloon attempts. In 1998 his balloon was caught in a thunderstorm off the Australian coast and ruptured at 8,800m (29,000ft), and Fossett crashed into the Coral Sea, a disaster he described as \"barely survivable\". As Paul Moore put it, \"This is not the first time on one of these missions that we have had communications problems. In fact it's endemic.\" GlobalFlyer's aerodynamic design was dreamed up by Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites aircraft factory and cost $1.5m to design and build. Scaled Composites is also developing SpaceShipOne, the craft in which Sir Richard hopes to become the first space tourist and to launch Virgin Atlantic passengers into space. Aside from the GPS problem, GlobalFlyer has so far lived up to expectations, chief engineer Jon Karkow of Scaled Composites said. It is constructed out of strong, lightweight materials to cope with the huge fuel payload that makes up 86% of its total weight of 10,045kg and to withstand the buffeting of the jet stream that will help it on its way. Its twin-tailed design consists of two fuel-filled booms - so fragile that Karkow compared them to watermelons - slung along the 114ft wingspan, dwarfing the central cockpit into which Fossett is crammed. He will urinate into bottles and dine only on diet chocolate milkshakes while trying to stay alert enough to pilot the plane as it rides the jet stream at an altitude of up to 51,000ft. The first solo round-the-world trip, a seven-day, multi-stop voyage, was undertaken by Wiley Post in 1933. The first nonstop global flight without refuelling was made in 1986 by Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan, the brother of the GlobalFlyer designer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
