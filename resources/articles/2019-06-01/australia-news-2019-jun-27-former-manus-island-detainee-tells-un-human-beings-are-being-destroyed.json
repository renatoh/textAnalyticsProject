The Sudanese refugee spent more than six years in Australia\u2019s offshore processing and detention system in Papua New Guinea, before he was granted residency in the European nation earlier this month. \u201cI feel excited to at least have a place I can a call home, but it\u2019s hard to have that sort of excitement when you have people still in that place,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Muhamat says he is shocked to find little awareness among the public of the long-running issues on Manus and Nauru. \u201cPeople are thinking we\u2019re living in a five-star hotel,\u201d he says. On Wednesday he stood before the UN human rights council\u2019s 41st session to say it was instead a humanitarian crisis which required urgent action. \u201cMany hundreds are still being detained. And they are being completely destroyed, physically and mentally. Twelve people have died,\u201d he said, speaking on behalf of Australia\u2019s Human Rights Law Centre. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time. Not a day, not a week, not a month. People are attempting suicide every hour.\u201d In Papua New Guinea especially, where only single men were sent by the Australian government, a mental health crisis worsened after the recent Australian election. Around 100 men are believed to have attempted suicide or self-harmed, and the local authorities are struggling to respond. \u201cWe urge your mandates and the council to continue to hold the Australian government to account for this breach of human rights,\u201d he said. Muhamat told the council politicians in Australia and internationally were demonising refugees to further their own political agenda. Edwina MacDonald, an HRLC legal director in Geneva to monitor Australia on the human rights council, said no government could truly stand for human rights while \u201cchoosing to severely damage the lives of innocent people\u201d. \u201cThe Australian government continues to act with breathtaking hypocrisy, claiming to support human rights at the UN while indefinitely imprisoning men and women in offshore detention camps,\u201d she said. Earlier this week Human Rights Watch wrote to Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, urging her to lead a more active presence on the human rights council. The organisation said Australia\u2019s reputation was damaged by its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, but it could use the remaining half of its term on the council to take specific and public action against human rights-abusing nations. Muhamat\u2019s statement followed another call from the UN\u2019s special rapporteurs on migrant rights, torture and mental health for the Australian government to provide immediate healthcare to people on Manus and Nauru and to transfer those requiring urgent care to Australia. The Australian government, which pays for contractors to provide physical and mental health in both countries, denied the assertion. The special rapporteurs responded that \u201cmany migrants suffer from deteriorating physical and mental health, which seem to have been the result of a lack of appropriate healthcare, exacerbated by the indefinite and prolonged confinement\u201d. Muhamat lodged a claim for asylum in Switzerland in February, when he was given permission to travel from Manus Island to Geneva and receive a human rights award. His claim was approved in June. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky to the Swiss government for their hospitality and for giving me one more chance, a chance that Australia failed to give me,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an amazing country and I\u2019m so lucky, and I hope to contribute to the community and to return the favour.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
