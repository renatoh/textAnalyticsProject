A clearly welcome return of a firm favourite (for most), only a year since its last appearance, this one (equally clearly) tougher than average. It struck me for the first time that the better PD clues are, the more difficult to solve they become, the break being that much more tricky to spot. I do spend more time than I probably should tinkering with the wording in order to achieve surface reading that is as natural as possible, so completing a PD puzzle takes at least twice as long as a normal plain. And there are always (it seems) a few entries which pose extra problems. Chief among these this time were ATROPOS and SCARAMOUCH, until I was rescued by Suzi Quatro and Pescara (after ages wrestling in vain with Oscar and lascars!). SMEATHS and NACARAT were also tricky to clue, the latter producing rather strained wording. All these obstacles you surmounted eventually, and only one competitor complained of never having heard of \u2018Telstar\u2019, that very successful instrumental chart-topper of yesteryear (verifiable on line, I\u2019m sure). Of the 12 clues cited as favourites, two stood out well ahead of the rest, the winner being \u2018What\u2019s that, painted pink? It\u2019s theft!\u2019 (PERT) with four votes more than \u2018It\u2019s good to see my old college pesters tarts\u2019 (ALASTRIM). AZED Slip No. 2,343 Clues submitted fully exploited the many opportunities offered by RESTORE (chosen, of course, with this in mind), and this made my task of picking the best really tough. I don\u2019t expect everyone to share my decision in favour of Mr Leyland\u2019s slightly improper first prizewinner, but I did admire its naturalness in both devilled and undevilled readings, a prime consideration in the judging process and a factor uppermost in the minds, I\u2019m sure, of all the competitors quoted. But I congratulate you all on an extremely high-quality entry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
