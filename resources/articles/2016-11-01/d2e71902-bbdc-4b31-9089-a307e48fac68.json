It was a recall that surprised everyone at Selhurst Park, Crystal Palace\u2019s defenders first and foremost. They failed to give the towering Ivorian nearly enough attention as he scored two goals, each characteristically diffident finishes of the highest quality, to win the match. Before his return, Tour\u00e9\u2019s main contribution to City\u2019s season has been as the apparently non-plussed subject of a spat between the manager and his own agent, Dimitri Seluk. For his part, Guardiola wanted the midfielder, whom he sold while manager of Barcelona but was central to City\u2019s two title wins, to lose weight and work harder without the ball. Seluk, meanwhile, wanted to tell anyone who would listen that Guardiola\u2019s actions, which included dropping Tour\u00e9 from City\u2019s Champions League squad, had amounted to the \u201chumiliation\u201d of his client. This month Tour\u00e9 took it upon himself to break the impasse and apologise to the club for any \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d that had occurred. Now, after the midfielder\u2019s two-goal return, Guardiola says he is willing to consider restoring Tour\u00e9 to European action in the new year. At last, everyone is happy. Bar Seluk, perhaps. \u201cIf we are able to qualify in the Champions League, I will sit with my staff and we will decide who are the best players to help us to achieve what we want in the Champions League,\u201d Guardiola said after this win. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken many times in the last month with Yaya because he was my player with Barcelona, I know him very well. I know how he is as a player. As a player there is no doubt, if there was a doubt he would not be here. He is another guy to compete with our midfield players and increase our level.\u201d Tour\u00e9, for his part, said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to return to the first team and gave thanks for the support of his team-mates. \u201cThey are very important to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have always been brilliant with me, always supportive. I always want to be there to help them.\u201d From the way the City players celebrated Tour\u00e9\u2019s goals, to the round of applause he received while walking down the tunnel, and the impressive bear lift applied by a delighted Willy Caballero, it was clear any respect was mutual. In fact, Tour\u00e9\u2019s performance on Saturday was fitful. He was off the pace in the opening exchanges. In the closing moments, when playing as an auxiliary forward, his sole intent (and an effective tactic) was to seek contact from an opponent and buckle quickly to the floor. In the middle of the match he was hardly more dynamic, largely contenting himself with knitting the play together. When Tour\u00e9 added his heft to the bodies around the Palace box, however, he increased the pressure on a mentally fragile defence to breaking point. Such was Palace\u2019s uncertainty in the build\u2011up to the opening goal that they presented the ball to City on three occasions before Tour\u00e9 finally accepted the invitation to exchange passes with Nolito and from the edge of the box, curl a shot into the roof of the net. His second goal, a deft flick from Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s daisycutter of a corner, was the softest of touches. Such is Tour\u00e9\u2019s natural power, it still flew in. Tour\u00e9 knows how to win league titles and retains an ability to make decisive interventions. Furthermore, his skills are distinct from the tricky, mobile forwards Guardiola favours. There will be times, like a cold, wet afternoon in south-east London against assertive opposition, when Tour\u00e9\u2019s power will prove invaluable to a side chasing the title in this most open of Premier League seasons. It would be stating the obvious again to point out that Guardiola must know this. The manager has won his battle of wills with Tour\u00e9 and now has another tool in his already well-stocked kit. No wonder then, when asked whether he regretted the last three months of acrimony, the Spaniard answered simply \u201cno\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
