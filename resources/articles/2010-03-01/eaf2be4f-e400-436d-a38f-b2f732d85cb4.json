It is the 1960s, and while Susan, daughter of smalltime villain, Joey, has reasons for getting away from home, she is still starry-eyed about marrying Barry. She has barely said \"I do\" before Barry is knocking her down at the altar and giving VD to the bridesmaid. Fast-forward 20 years and Susan is in Holloway, convicted of killing her wayward husband, and refusing to appeal. She's in stark contrast to her cell-mate, middle-class Matty, who is playing to perfection the role of victim driven to murder by an abusive husband. One revelation follows another in an adaptation that makes the average episode of EastEnders look like a model of Pinteresque restraint, but it is highly watchable. At least it would be, if Ryan Romain's production played to its strengths and offered a fluid staging rather than emphasising the short episodic scenes with lots of clunky scene changes. It needs someone at the helm with the skills to render it modern and genuinely gritty, not just soapy. Cole's portrayal of female relationships, particularly the one between Cathy Murphy's bright-eyed Susan and Barry's heart-of-gold mistress Roselle (Sally Oliver), is always slippery and intriguing. Victoria Alcock injects depth into Susan's jealous, inadequate mum, June, and Alison Newman is good value as reliable friend Doreen. But some of the other performances are shockingly bad in a production that goes through the motions, but never blazes and rages into life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
