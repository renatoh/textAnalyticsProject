Chelsea had hoped to three or four major signings to supplement a squad which came 10th last season, their lowest finish under Roman Abramovich, and had initially hoped the bulk of their business would have been concluded well before the start of the Italian\u2019s first Premier League campaign. However, only N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Michy Batshuayi, for a combined \u00a365.1m from Leicester City and Marseille respectively, have arrived to date. Dinamo Zagreb\u2019s Portuguese goalkeeper, Eduardo, should arrive next week to provide cover for Thibaut Courtois, and interest in Napoli\u2019s Kalidou Koulibaly remains strong. Yet the Italian club, who have already rejected an offer worth \u00a342.5m for the centre-half, now value the 25-year-old at closer to \u00a360m. That for a player who has six caps for Senegal and cost only \u00a37m from Genk in 2014. Conte said last week that the transfer market had become \u201ccrazy\u201d in the wake of the Premier League\u2019s latest broadcast deal. \u201cYes, \u2018crazy\u2019 for the prices [being quoted],\u201d he said. \u201cAt this moment it\u2019s very difficult to buy because, also, if you ask a player of the medium level, a club might ask for \u00a355m. For this reason, it\u2019s a crazy market. It\u2019s very difficult to enter the market with these prices and in this condition. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable [paying over the odds]. I don\u2019t like to pay a lot of money. If a player warrants us paying [lots of] money, then it\u2019s right. But for a medium player, it\u2019s right only to pay the right price, not \u00a320m-30m over. That\u2019s not right. The money is not mine, but I don\u2019t like it the same. I don\u2019t find it right.\u201d The manager remains in regular contact with the director Marina Granovskaia and the technical director Michael Emenalo over potential incoming and outgoing transfers. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to speak about discussions I have with the club, but we are awaiting the right solution to improve Chelsea,\u201d said Conte. \u201cWe need to sign some players. We are now a few players down in defence \u2013 we only have a few \u2013 but we are working together, me and the club, to find the right solution. \u201cWe must be patient and wait. Not only at Chelsea, too: I have seen this with the other clubs. It\u2019s very difficult to have a \u2018good market\u2019, but now it\u2019s a real situation for all of us. We must live with it and find a solution. We have two weeks before the end of the transfer market. If we can improve this squad, we want to improve it.\u201d There is interest, too, in the Wolfsburg left-back Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez and Everton\u2019s Romelu Lukaku, though hopes of securing the Real Madrid forward, \u00c1lvaro Morata, have long since faded. Chelsea had anticipated a similar number of departures after last season\u2019s toils, with Mohamed Salah having completed his permanent \u00a312m move to Roma and Papy Djilobodji joining Sunderland for \u00a38m. The other departures have largely been on loan, with both Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my and Juan Cuadrado likely to join the ranks leaving Stamford Bridge before the deadline on 31 August. R\u00e9my, who scored in midweek against Brentford B for a Chelsea side made up of players available for loan, may join Crystal Palace and is available for \u00a39m on a permanent basis, or for a \u00a33m loan fee. Cuadrado\u2019s situation is arguably more complicated given Conte had made great efforts to recall him from his loan at Juventus with a view to integrating him into the first-team in south-west London. However, the Colombian remains unsettled and is expected to return to Italy, with Juve and Milan having already expressed interest in securing him on a similar 12-month deal with a view to a permanent transfer. \u201cWhen it comes to transfer policy, I speak with the club,\u201d added Conte. \u201cI have a contact every day and, I repeat, we must search to find the right solutions for the market, to buy and to sell. For Cuadrado we are waiting on the situation. It must become more clear about his position. Now he\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s player. Today he had training with us. We will see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
