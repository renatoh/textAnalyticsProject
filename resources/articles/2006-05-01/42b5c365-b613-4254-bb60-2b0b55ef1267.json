According to a health ministry report, 13 million people have metabolic syndrome, a condition characterised by abdominal obesity that increases the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. A further 14 million people are at risk of developing the syndrome, the report said. Experts blame the problem partly on the shift away from the low-fat Japanese diet of fish, vegetables and rice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
