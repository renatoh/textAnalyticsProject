The Welsh Rugby Union commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out the investigation in January after the four regions announced that they had jointly agreed to impose a \u00a33.5m salary cap next season and embarked on a 20% cost-cutting exercise which has seen Welsh internationals past and present sign contracts with sides outside the country. The Connacht-bound Cardiff Blues and Wales scrum-half Richie Rees on Tuesday became the latest player to join the exodus with the WRU hinting that four regions may be one too many. Stuart Gallacher, the chief executive of Regional Rugby Wales, said the priority had to be to keep the leading players with their regions. \"We need three things,\" Gallacher said. \"The first is sustainability \u2013 we do not want to be in this position next year. The second is that we keep our best players in Wales and I think we can. Then we can drive forward and become competitive again. When the report is finished, it will be considered by a steering group made up of representatives from the regions and the WRU. Central contracts may be part of the solution but what exactly would they entail? The devil is always in the detail.\" The regions hosted a media conference at Cardiff City Stadium on Tuesday and Wales's grand slam\u2011winning squad were present in their regional kits ahead of this weekend's two derbies in the RaboDirect Pro 12. The aim of the gathering was to emphasise that the Six Nations success was a collective effort, starting from the WRU's 300 member clubs. It was a day when the former Wales and Lions full-back JPR Williams criticised regional rugby, branding it a complete disgrace. \"I hope it folds soon,\" he said, \"because regional rugby is absolutely dire.\" He proposed Wales pulling out of the Pro 12 and setting up an eight-team league. \"It staggers me that a man of JPR's acumen could come out with a statement so full of nonsense,\" Gallacher said. \"It is only a short time ago that we had nine clubs, did not win anything and were beaten in Europe by 60 points. Since regional rugby was introduced, Wales have won three grand slams compared to none in the previous 26 years. Where will the money and players come from for eight teams? What he said beggars belief. \"We are in the middle of one of the biggest recessions this country has suffered and we need to understand what we can afford. I am optimistic because rugby is our national game but we have to secure the future of regional rugby. I do not see losing a region as a step forward, but a step back.\" The Scarlets and Wales hooker Matthew Rees, one of the few players in the Wales squad whose career has straddled the club and regional eras, said he would welcome central contracts. \"It is vital that we keep the best players in Wales,\" he said. \"We have lost five of the current squad to French clubs and it is a concern, something we need to correct for the regions to be successful. \"If we continue to lose players it could have a detrimental effect on Wales because, as we have seen this year, boys have to return to their clubs in France and England during the free weekends in the Six Nations and they could not spend the whole week in our training camp in Poland. Central contracts would be good for Wales and the regions. The Newport Gwent Dragons and Wales flanker Dan Lydiate, a strong contender to the named the Six Nations man of the tournament on Wednesday, said he wanted to remain in the regional game. \"I have a year to go on my contract with the Dragons,\" he said. \"I want to stay in Wales and play for Wales but our performances in the World Cup and again this year have clearly raised the profile of the players.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
