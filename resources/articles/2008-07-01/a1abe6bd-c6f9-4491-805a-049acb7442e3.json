Not because she is formulating a clever response but because she is genuinely wondering about a question that has never occurred to her before. Cathy is the new face \u2013 or at least one of the new faces \u2013 of the 73 million-strong Communist party, which she joined last year. Her name is actually Huang Zhaoying but, like many of the westernised elite, she uses an \"English name\" based loosely on the Chinese original. But she hasn't always been a member of the elite. Cathy, 23, is from the southern Fujian province, where her mother works for a state-owned factory that produces air-conditioning units and her father is a policeman. Born nearly a decade after the death of Chairman Mao, Cathy grew up in the China transformed by late leader Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. And her story reveals much about modern China. Helped by private tutors, a decent school and natural talent, she came first out of 300,000 in Fujian's college entry exams, winning a place and a scholarship to the prestigious Beijing University. Now Cathy is in her second year of a course in international finance and business management in a new \"experimental faculty\". Tuition is in English by teachers with American educational backgrounds. She has recently completed an internship at Goldman Sachs, the American investment bank, and with Lehman Brothers, in London. \"My future is in corporate finance,\" she says, and she is probably not wrong. Like many, Cathy joined the Communist party at university. The party is represented in every school and university \u2013 as it is in every factory, major business or association nationwide. Teachers or professors or commissars suggest to likely recruits that they might like to think about taking the tough entry exams. Through this system, the party - founded in 1921 - aims to capture the best and the brightest, those with most initiative and executive capability. Its members are the pool from which the economic, military and political leaders of the country are drawn, so the advantage in making that reserve as deep as possible is clear. Party members are overwhelmingly urban and educated, largely from the upper-working or lower-middle classes - exactly the social strata that could pose the most threat if they were not given a strong stake in the current system. Ideology has been relegated to second place. Instead, a sense of duty, excellence, cooperation and, above all, patriotism are stressed. So if you thought that there was an inherent contradiction between being a communist and working for American or British corporate finance houses, think again. Cathy certainly sees no tension. \"I didn't study Marxism too much,\" she says. \"And you don't have to apply historical dialectic materialism to daily life.\" Being a member of the party, she explains, is not a political choice but is about \"contributing to China\" - about \"standing up and being counted\". So when the recent earthquake struck, Cathy contacted other party members working for her investment bank and started raising relief funds. And it is also about being part of the elite \u2013 and about networking. \"Joining the party is very popular,\" Cathy said. \"If you got top marks then you definitely apply. So here all the top students are members \u2026 and a majority of the business school.\" In the cafeteria of another Beijing university, four other students echo Cathy's words. All are between 21 and 23 and have recently joined the party. They come from similar backgrounds to Cathy, with parents who are government officers, teachers or middle managers in state-owned enterprises and often party members themselves. None of their parents has a degree, not least because they were of college age during the violent anti-intellectual fervour of the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. Their views are similar to Cathy's, a mixture of the open, the ideological, the idealist, the dogmatic and the nationalist. Asked why they joined the party, they cite the influence of their parents, of the history of their \"great leaders\" taught at school, of how being a member helps get government jobs. They say that to be a member of the party is \"an honour\". \"You cannot deny what the party has done for China,\" says Wang Yuqin. \"Look at the difference in the management of the Sichuan Earthquake and of Hurricane Katrina.\" And they agree with Cathy that there is no tension between working for a major American investment bank and being a Communist party member. \"If a socialist country wants to develop, it needs finance too so banking should not be a symbol of capitalism,\" says Xue Yan-wen. And the repression of the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989? Like Cathy \u2013 and so many Chinese when conversation comes close to politically dangerous terrain \u2013 they profess ignorance: \"We were two years old. We do not know much about it. We have no opinion on that.\" Mentioning Tibet provokes a slew of interesting comparisons overseas. \"Why focus on Tibet,\" asks Tong Jingjing. \"Why not Quebec, Northern Ireland, Texas, Chechnya or Kashmir?\" Of the five, Cathy, with her internships in the US, the UK, Hong Kong and elsewhere, is the best travelled. \"The further I have been the more I have felt my Chinese identity,\" she says. \"I have heard a lot of criticism of China, a lot of critical voices \u2026 but that has merely strengthened my sense of being Chinese.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
