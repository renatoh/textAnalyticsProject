FROM WESTMINSTER The Backbencher asked the Guardian's political editor, Michael White, how IDS's final appearance at PMQs went down in the Commons. \"His MPs were quite supportive - they laughed at his jokes and waved their order papers, but it wasn't by any means the dramatic emotional show of solidarity you might have expected. \"IDS himself made several good jokes. 'I'm going to ask the prime minister a question I've asked at least 18 times over the last two years.' Then he paused. 'A fat lot of good it has done me,' he joked, 'but I'm going to ask it one last time.' His perennial question, as loyal readers of Guardian Unlimited will know, is: 'Why won't he give the British people a referendum on the European constitution?' \"Mr Blair replied: 'Sorry, 19th time unlucky, I'm going to give the same answer which is that it doesn't fundamentally change Britain's relationship with the EU.' IDS said John Prescott had announced three referendums just this week on regional government in the north of England. That made 37 since 1997, and if we could have an election for a Hull assembly and for a monkey mayor in Hartlepool, why couldn't we have one on something pretty fundamental such as this? \"As MPs dispersed, reporters dispersed to try and find out whether Mr Brown was up to something in his newspaper forays overnight, or whether it was one of those unhappy coincidences. I must say, as someone who's always happy to grab a conspiracy if one happens to be passing on the Whitehall bus, I'm coming to the view that it's just one of those pieces of bad luck. Mr Brown's Telegraph article can't have been very helpful to No 10, but don't forget that he's got a rough ride ahead. He's got Michael Howard, the shadow chancellor and new leader of the Conservative party, a formidable opponent, just at a time when interest rates are expected to go up, the pre-budget report due shortly, and the likelihood that taxes will have to rise. \"So it may be that in assuming that Mr Brown is sniping at the prime minister that we're looking at it in the wrong way. It may be that the chancellor is worried about that other would-be PM who will, tomorrow, become leader of the Conservative party.\" Meanwhile, Kevin Maguire relates the story of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Chapter 11: The Latest Split. \"Tom and Jerry, Laurel and Hardy, Morecambe and Wise, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple - all pairs have their ups and downs, and it's no different in the Labour party. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are the real architects of New Labour: they were there in 1994 at the birth of that political faction that took over the Labour party, and won the 1997 election, the 2001 election, and will probably win the 2005 election in some form. They've been responsible for a huge reform programme in Britain (if a bit of a disappointment to the left). \"And yet they spark off each other. They argue in private, they swear at each other occasionally, they have moody silences - one is as bad as the other. They have big policy differences: over the NHS - should charges be introduced for patients? Should foundation hospitals be created? - over university top-up fees - should students pay now or should they pay more income tax? And over Europe too - when should we go into the single currency? Should we adopt the new constitution as it stands or, as Mr Brown says, is it somewhat dangerous? There may even have been differences over Iraq, but they've always hidden that. \"So the latest spat - over whether or not Mr Brown should be allowed to join Labour's national executive committee - well, it's just to be expected. Mr Blair's obviously decided to keep him off - his old foe would become an even bigger enemy if he was in control of the party machine (particularly, of course, if Mr Brown ever chose to make a leadership bid). So Mr Blair has brutally elbowed him aside, twice turning him down. \"The relationship is in its grumpy middle age. They can't live together, and they can't live without each other. But will they go their separate ways and divorce, or will they patch it up? We'll find out soon.\" PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS \"For the final time: 'Nobody believes a word he says anymore' ...\" Matthew Tempest reports on Iain Duncan Smith's last PMQs. BREAKING NEWS Downing Street today slapped down talk of a split between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as \"blahtastic\", after a series of provocative policy interventions and possible snubs in the 48 hours since the chancellor returned from paternity leave.

Full story Geoff Hoon has denied speculation that the MoD is looking to make cuts to minimise war costs.

Full story More police should be armed to cope with increasing gun crime, MPs are expected to recommend. Full story LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION A clear winner: John Golden was the only entrant who knew which achievement Michael \"Gaoler\" Howard prizes above all. \"I know what causes crime!\" Gaoler QC announced. \"Criminals!\" Locking them up produced an 18% drop in crime, according to central office. Since then, of course, the prison population has risen inexorably - but Silky no doubt has an explanation for that. Meanwhile, for the avoidance of confusion, let's have a roll-call of some of the people who share Silky's name. There's Michael Howard, a program manager on Microsoft's Windows security team. (\"Michael Howard investigates an often-ignored code construct that can lead to serious buffer overruns ...\") There's Michael Howard of the Michael Howard Work and Study Centre for the Professional Actor in New York. There's the military historian Professor Sir Michael Howard. Lastly - for your sakes - there's Michael Howard, the 22-year-old Swansea defender who was shown the yellow card during a clash with Southend last night. THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION This week's prize is How Not To Be A Hypocrite: School Choice for the Morally Perplexed, courtesy of Routledge Falmer). \"The most intellectually aggressive case for state education in recent times,\" said Will Hutton. To win it, tell the Backbencher the name of the first British prime minister to have benefited from a state education. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. STATELY GNOMES Where he got it, the Backbencher can't imagine - but Roy Hattersley confided to Daily Mail readers on Monday that he owns a gnome in the likeness of Neil Kinnock. The object apparently shares Roy's bathroom with a pottery Tony Blair. Thank God John Smith never lived to see himself shunned so. Still, that wasn't the only revelation in Roy's feature. \"[Gnomes] have also enlivened our broadcasting schedules,\" he informed readers. \"A television series called The Gnomes Of Dulwich was a smash hit in the 70s.\" What Roy didn't explain - and the Backbencher, whose memories of the 70s are extremely vague, was intrigued to discover - is that The Gnomes of Dulwich was a political fable for our times. \"Storylines revolved around the clashes between the solid stone British gnomes of 25 Telegraph Road, led by Big, Small and Old, and their plastic European counterparts recently introduced to the neighbourhood,\" the BBC's publicly-funded website recalls. \"Passions ran high between the different factions, with racial and cultural differences at the centre of most of the arguments. These enabled the series to take satirical swipes at the Common Market controversies raging at the time. (The title itself was a play on Harold Wilson's famous 'gnomes of Zurich' description of Swiss bankers.)\" What could be more relevant to the current debate over asylum seekers? Perhaps a timely BBC4 repeat is in order. SCHWARZISM \"While he was growing up, the politics in the household of Steven Druckenmiller always leaned toward the liberal side. So when the 20-year-old goes home, he takes delight in wearing a shirt from his college Republican club.\" No, the Backbencher isn't quoting the Onion. This is the Chicago Tribune - quickly blogged by GeorgeWBush.com, the world's least compelling political blog - describing the surge in Republican sentiment across university campuses. \"At Capital University here, Druckenmiller and several dozen others regularly hold meetings to discuss tax policy, free trade and other conservative bedrocks,\" reports the Tribune. If you believe that, you'll believe anything. \"Membership in the rival Democratic group, meanwhile, has dwindled to two. 'Sure,' the college junior said with a smile, 'some of us have liberal parents and are rebelling.'\" \"Wearing a college Republican sweatshirt and holding a bullhorn ...\" No, the Backbencher can't carry on, but she does invite readers to speculate on the meaning of Druckenmiller's next pronouncement: \"It's a blend of Arnold Schwarzenegger-esque conservatism.\" Schwarzism. It has, the Backbencher admits, a certain ring to it. GIVE UP BUT DON'T GIVE OUT John \"Dr\" Reid has now gone without a cigarette for 11 months. Will he last the year? It rather depends, the Backbencher predicts, on whether the foundation hospitals bill returns to the Commons before Christmas. FORTHCOMING EVENTS Ken Livingstone will host his third London conference on November 29. Anyone can attend, but they need to register in advance. The Social Market Foundation has three events coming up: a lunchtime discussion on the future of aviation with the appropriate minister, Tony McNulty MP, on November 6; \"Corporate social responsibility\" with Stephen Timms at the Asda Walmart HQ in Leeds on November 10; and, on November 18, Turning the Clock Forward; Rethinking Migration for the 21st century with Barbara Roche MP.

A CORRECTION \"Everyone always gets this wrong,\" complains a reader. \"Iain Dale is not the Tories' first openly gay candidate. David Gold was, in Brighton Pavilion constituency, at the last general election. He lost.\" Happy to correct that - though it's also true that David didn't tell his constituency party he was gay until after he was selected.
