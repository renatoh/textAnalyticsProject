Swansea\u2019s new head coach will cast his mind back to the day when he was standing in for Carlo Ancelotti and hauled off Cristiano Ronaldo at the Bernab\u00e9u. \u201cI actually took him off, would you believe that?\u201d Clement said, smiling. \u201cIn our very last game at Real Madrid, Carlo was serving a two-game suspension. We were playing Getafe and we were going to take off Cristiano in the second half. We\u2019d spoken about it at half-time. I said: \u2018Cris, we\u2019re going to take you off in this minute,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Who\u2019s coming on for me?\u2019 I actually put on Martin Odegaard and it was his debut for the club. Is that a claim to fame? I could say to some of the Swansea players if I take them off and they shake their head: \u2018I\u2019ve taken off Cristiano Ronaldo, so I can take you off.\u2019\u201d Clement delivered that last line with a chuckle. Speaking to the media for the first time since replacing Bob Bradley, the 44-year-old came across as a man delighted to be managing again and still enjoying the adrenaline rush from Tuesday night\u2019s 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace. \u201cI felt more excited to be on the touchline than at a Bayern game when you\u2019re an assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel a lot more when you\u2019re head coach and that win felt very special.\u201d The easy decision would have been to stay at Bayern Munich, where Clement was working alongside Ancelotti for the fourth time, following spells at Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. Clement said he \u201cfelt comfortable at that level\u201d, yet ultimately he wanted far more than to be a No2. \u201cI\u2019ve never settled for that; I want to feel the pressure because the worst thing about pressure is having none of it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have pressure \u2013 it makes you feel alive.\u201d There is no shortage of pressure in the Premier League relegation zone. Swansea are second bottom with 15 points from 20 matches and Clement, who had eight months in charge of Derby County last season, admitted that keeping the club up was the biggest challenge of his career. He hopes to bring in new faces this month and has added a few names to the list the board assembled before he arrived, with an answer to a question about Frank Lampard\u2019s potential availability suggesting that the former England international may well have been sounded out without success. \u201cMy impression from people close to him is that he is going to take a break from the game,\u201d Clement said. Either way, Clement believes there are solutions to be found on the pitches at the training ground and not just via the chequebook. \u201cThere are capable and able footballers here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think over recent games to ship three goals, four goals, five goals \u2013 I\u2019m confident in my ability as a coach that that won\u2019t happen during my reign. I can\u2019t say 100% it won\u2019t \u2013 there is a lot of randomness in football. But I\u2019m pretty confident it won\u2019t happen because I can get a team organised. With the players that I\u2019ve currently got, I think I can get them more organised than they\u2019ve been, give them a bit of solidity in the defensive work and that\u2019s the foundation to build what they\u2019ve already shown they can be good at, which is the offensive side.\u201d Clement adopted a similarly pragmatic approach at Derby, during his only other experience as a manager, but was sacked last February with the club fifth in the Championship. \u201cI often get asked about my time at Derby and there\u2019s a lot of contrasting views about what happened, from a harsh dismissal or \u2013 an interesting one I read the other day \u2013 my time at Derby was \u2018an absolute disaster\u2019. The only important thing about that is how I felt and I think about it as a positive experience. I learned a lot.\u201d The only negative aspect to Clement\u2019s press conference surrounded the future of Alan Curtis, who has been told he will no longer have a role with the first team. Curtis, who had three spells as a player at Swansea and is a club legend in the eyes of the supporters, will meet Huw Jenkins, the chairman, on Friday to discuss another position. It is understood that Jenkins initially contacted Curtis via text and it is hard to escape the feeling that the whole episode could have been handled much better. \u201cHe won\u2019t be on the training field and won\u2019t be on the bench but we want him around and having that communication with players,\u201d Clement said. \u201cWe respect him and the club respects him for what he\u2019s done here. I really hope he finds a role he\u2019s happy with at Swansea.\u201d As for Clement and his relationship with Ancelotti, there seems little prospect of them working together again. \u201cThat\u2019s it now,\u201d said Clement, smiling, when asked whether he could envisage being reunited with the Italian again. \u201cWe have not spoken about that and I don\u2019t think we need to. I suppose it is never say never, but the chances of that happening are less than before. All my focus is on being successful here and not doing that again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
