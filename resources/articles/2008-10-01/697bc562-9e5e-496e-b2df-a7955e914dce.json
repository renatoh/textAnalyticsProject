The news follows a meeting between Maradona and the Argentina Football Association (AFA) president, Julio Grondona, in Buenos Aires. The 47 year-old, who many regard as the greatest footballer to ever grace the game, revealed he was on the verge of accepting the role. \"The offer from Julio Grondona attracted me a lot,\" he said. \"As soon as it is confirmed, I will start working, but I can say I am very proud.\" Maradona, who turns 48 on Thursday, added: \"I'm not the coach yet, but it would be a lovely birthday present.\" If confirmed, the former Boca Juniors, Napoli and Barcelona star will succeed Alfio Basile, who stepped down from the position on October 16 for personal reasons. Pedro Troglio, coach of Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno, claimed he has already been approached by Maradona to become a member of the new Argentina set-up. Reports in Argentina have said that Carlos Bilardo, the coach when Maradona captained the national side to World Cup victory in Mexico in 1986, is also expected to work alongside him as technical secretary, but the AFA is not expected to confirm the coaching set-up until Thursday. Sergio Batista, coach of the Argentina under-20 side, was believed to be in the frame for the position as well, but Maradona's iconic status looks to have been the deciding factor in swaying the AFA's decision. The appointment appears to follow a recent trend within national football associations to install former successful national team players with little coaching experience into the manager's position. Recent examples have been reasonably successful: Jurgen Klinsmann guided Germany to a World Cup semi-final, Marco van Basten ushered in a more youthful Dutch team and Slaven Bilic oversaw Croatia's impressive Euro 2008 qualification before watching his side lose in injury-time in the quarter-final. But Maradona's numerous personal problems, including drug addiction and weight problems, in addition to his limited experience as a coach in just two brief stints at Argentine club sides Racing Club de Avellaneda and Mandiy\u00fa de Corrientes over 10 years ago, would appear to make him a much riskier proposition. Maradona's first match in charge of Argentina is expected to be a friendly against Scotland at Hampden Park later this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
