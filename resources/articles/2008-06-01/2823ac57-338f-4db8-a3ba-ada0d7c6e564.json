This year feels transitional, nothing particularly epoch-making is happening and the best dance record, Blind by Hercules and Love Affair, sounds like it was recorded in 1989. So when Hamburg's Digitalism were asked to tell a story with their mix - hence the title Tabloid - they probably found there's not much to shout about at the moment. Still, they've assemble a bunch of good tunes and it's less lairy than you might expect from a duo associated with rock-tinged rave. The best of 2008 is represented by Midnight Juggernauts, Proxy and Hot Chip, and the result is a diverse mix which will enliven a summer holiday rather than signpost where dance music may go next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
