Unless you want the mother of all hangovers the next day. We had gone out for a quietish night (albeit on Salta's busiest street) and ended up listening to live music and drinking heavy, blackcurranty red wines till 5am with the folk singers in all their finery - the men in traditional bloomers, the women in long floral dresses. Along the way we had been serenaded and dragged onto the dance floor, where I ended up spinning round the room with a man who, even in his high-heeled boots, only came up to my chest. We felt like a pair of naughty teenagers as we snuck back into our hotel, El Lager, just before dawn, shush-ing each other as we tiptoed across glossy cherry wood floors. Later that day my mouth felt like the desert itself. We sat in Salta's main square nursing coffees and sore heads as the town went about its business -a priest in flowing black robes and a wide-brimmed hat floated across the plaza greeting everyone who crossed his path; school girls in plaid skirts and knee-high white socks sat on benches scoffing popcorn between giggles; the shoe shiner did brisk business. Salta in the far north-west of Argentina comes as a shock after the mayhem of Buenos Aires. It may be the biggest city in the region with a suitably ornate cathedral in dazzling pink and cream but it still has the feel of a dusty cowboy town, one where men wear big belts and the pavements are so high they have an extra step down to the road. The entire city is encircled by mountains that stand guard protectively over the million or so inhabitants or loom dark and menacing, depending on your mood. The plan was to head north of Salta into those mountains, through the Quebrada de Humahuaca, a long and spectacular canyon, and up towards the Bolivian border. The scenery en route is incredible but much of the road is unpaved, so the best way to travel is with a driver and guide - they negotiate the potholes, you sit back and take it all in. The first part of the journey is impressive as the road snakes through a cloud forest thick with ancient trees, ferns and hanging grasses - a bizarre geographical blip in the otherwise arid landscape - but it's not until you get into the Quebrada itself that the real drama begins. The canyon floor is green, dotted with fields of peach and avocado trees and tobacco plants, tiny cemeteries and white-washed churches with cactus-wood roofs, but the mountains either side are dry and craggy, rising up in jagged, unforgiving peaks and covered in fat hairy fingers of cacti that point directly at the brilliant blue sky. In places the rock is stripey where copper and iron have formed undulating layers of colour; elsewhere water has carved thin columns or \"organ pipes\" into the side of the mountain and formed single towers of rock that stand alone like giant teeth. This is not the Argentina you see on TV or in adverts. There are no grassy plains or glassy lakes. It feels like a different country. You see the difference too in the broad faces of the people who are descended not from the Spanish but from the Inca and have more in common with their neighbours over the border in Bolivia than they do with Argentines living further south. And the food was not what we'd come to expect either. At 3,000 metres, we stopped for lunch in Humahuaca, the largest village in the canyon. Instead of steak we ordered goat stew which we ate to the sound of clattering pans and tinny folk music coming from the kitchen. At 4,000m a pile of rocks, covered in bags of coca leaves and plastic bottles full of Chicha, an alcohol made from corn, turned out to be an offering to a spirit, further evidence that while the capital may be busy building designer hotels, this corner is still steeped in ancient tradition. In the late afternoon we finally reached Iruya, a remote village at the end of the road - literally. From here on you have to go by foot. Which is why we had come. Over dinner that night at the Iruya hostel Maru, our guide, asked how far we walked on average a week. I totted up the five minutes from my house to the tube each morning - about four miles a week, I reckoned - and glossed over my lack of experience. The next day my lack of stamina soon became apparent. After an hour or so of trudging up the dry river bed Maru pointed at up at sheer rock face. \"We're going up there.\" I laughed. It looked impenetrable. Still there were people coming down with donkeys so there had to be a path. We started to climb, slowly, breathing steadily. An old woman on her way to Iruya recognised Maru and stopped to talk. She told us how she'd once chased a puma from her land with nothing more than shouts and a stick. When she'd finished her story she gave my boyfriend a withering look and said, \"I bet you couldn't fight a puma. We women are braver.\" She went on to say her that family were trying to persuade her to move down to the village but she was having none of it. \"The view is better from my place.\" She had a point. An hour or so later we came to her small house clinging to the edge of a windswept plateau. To the south we had a spectacular view of the valley we'd just walked up; to the north was the next valley, greener and more gentle. In the distance we could make out the edge of a football pitch, high up on the slope, and further still, San Juan, where Maru and her husband had built a hut - our home for the night. By the time we made it down into the valley and - the final killer - climbed up through San Juan to the hut we were on the verge of collapse. Coffee and biscuits and the smell of chicken stew revived us and we spent the rest of the night warmed by the gas light and a bottle of red. The wine was an unexpected pleasure. We were surprised again the next day when Maru produced another bottle in another extraordinary landscape. After the trek back to Iruya and another night at the hostel, we had made our way back to Salta via the Salinas Grandes (salt flats). We sat down to lunch at a table made of salt. It was the most bizarre setting for a picnic, the more so when Maru plonked a bottle of malbec on the table (complete with table cloth, proper plates and cutlery). We toasted each other (for surviving the trek) in the middle of the vast blinding white. Most Argentinian wine in your local offy is from Mendoza, by far the country's biggest wine producing region. But the malbec we had on the salt flats was from Etchart near Cafayate, south of Salta. Cafayate produces less than 5% of the country's wine but 25% of its fine wines. We decided to make it our next stop. It didn't look too far from Salta on the map but getting there turned out to be a major expedition. \"It's lovely isn't it?\" said Henry, the man from the car hire office, pointing at the Golf. It wasn't lovely. It wasn't even functional. Nothing worked without being bashed or slammed. As Henry got the motor going by slamming his foot to the floor and enveloping us in fumes, we wondered how long this rusty heap would last on the unpaved road to Cafayate. We didn't get far on the first day - not because of the car but because we stopped at Los Los, a small family ranch in the fertile Lerma valley, just outside Salta, and after being welcomed with homemade lemonade and cakes and lots of mi casa es tu casas, decided to stay the night. That afternoon we set out on horseback with the farmhand, Ibanez, who was everything a ranchero should be - surly, monosyllabic and sporting great white whiskers. We rode along the river bed, the horses kicking up dust behind us, lush green hills ahead and behind them the shadow of grey-green mountains. Back at the ranch, the owner, Guillermo, had piled a mountain of goat's leg, ribs of beef, pork flank, a leg of lamb and tripe on the barbecue and we gorged on the crispy, smoky, juicy meat. Later we sat on the verandah with Guillermo as various sons, nephews, cousins stuck their heads round the door to welcome us to their home. Coffee was drunk out of fine gold-rimmed china cups, It's a Wonderful Life played on the stereo and we wondered whether we should cancel our road trip. But we tore ourselves away the next morning, and for the next three days travelled at about 20km a hour. It was the wacky races transferred to north-west Argentina, and we were definitely losing, bumping along through the craggy landscape dodging rocks and occasionally goats on the road, and disappearing every now and then into a cloud of dust as another pick-up passed us. We spent the night in villages, Cachi, and Molinos, classic desert pueblos, just a church, a cluster of squat adobe houses and a hostel. After a day on the road everything - our clothes, bags, skin, nostrils - was gritty with dust and we would knock back bottles of Quilmes (beer) like they were water. It felt like we were living out some Wild West fantasy. There were men in ponchos, the sound of meat sizzling on home-made barbecues and, in the morning, the smell of damp earth and wood smoke in the air. The only thing missing was the horses - which no doubt would have been more reliable than our little Golf. Still, the drive was more than worth it. The landscape from Molinos to Cafayate was even more bizarre than anything we'd seen before - drier, almost lunar. Not even cactus seemed to grow here, just stubby thorny bushes amid sharp pillars of rock. At points the mountains encroached forming narrow tunnels as if trying to reclaim the road. And Cafayate itself felt positively cosmopolitan after the tiny one-horse villages we'd passed through to get there. El Rancho restaurant on the main square where we had the best steak of our entire trip, for about \u00a34, was busy with tourists en route to the surrounding vineyards. Standing on the vine-covered slope at Finca las Nubes, a small boutique vineyard just outside Cafayate, looking out across the mountains, I thought back to the folk songs we'd danced to in Salta. They had sung of women and heartache - of course - but also about the region they grew up in. I hadn't understood all the words, but I saw now why they had been singing so passionately about this land. It is truly extraordinary.
