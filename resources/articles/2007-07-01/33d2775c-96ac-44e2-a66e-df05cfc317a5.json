There is wide concern at Westminster that the allegations and lengthy investigation severely dented voters' faith in the conduct of politics. Peter Watt, the Labour party general secretary, thanked the police for their hard work and diligence. But, he said, the inquiry had given the public a \"detrimental impression of politics and all political parties\". Several Labour figures expressed concern that the length of and the high profile given to Scotland Yard's investigations had increased public concerns about the allegations. Tony Wright, chairman of the Commons public administration select committee, which was investigating before the police inquiry began, suggested the issue had been one for politicians, not the police, to deal with. \"It's done great damage to our political system,\" Dr Wright told the BBC. \"Our system is fundamentally clean. It needs eternal vigilance, but basically political issues need to be resolved by the political system.\" John McTernan, one of the former No 10 aides questioned in the inquiry, suggested its length amplified suspicions. \"I think everybody in politics wishes it had been done faster, because ultimately, for the public, it just looks mucky and murky - and I don't think anybody who is involved in politics actually genuinely believes anybody at a senior level in any of the major parties is involved in anything dodgy in relation to this.\" Others, especially Angus MacNeil, the Scottish Nationalist MP whose complaint began the investigation, would strongly dispute that view. But he is one of those who hope the investigation will in the long run prove positive, reshaping the culture around donations and nominations for honours: \"I think it has changed the political climate in the UK.\" Sir Alistair Graham, Westminster's former sleaze watchdog , said it had all \"led to a massive loss of trust, not just in Tony Blair at the end of his period in office, but in all politicians\". However, reforming the Lords and agreeing on party funding changes would help; Gordon Brown had put forward a \"reasonably impressive\" package of governance reform. But, said Sir Alistair, loopholes would always exist. \"I don't think there's any magic piece of legislation. It's about cultural change - how politicians behave. Blair should not have gone in for secret loans.\" Sir Menzies Campbell warned politicians to be patient in rebuilding trust: \"You can lose your reputation in an hour, and it will take 10 years to rebuild.\" The answer, the Lib Dem leader admonished his Westminster colleagues, was always to practise \"transparency, transparency, transparency\". Others suggested stronger sanctions might be needed, so if abuses come to light they can be dealt with effectively. Labour peer Lord Harris of Haringey, a member and former chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority, said a review of honours laws might be necessary. Some suggest it is almost impossible to prosecute under the 1925 Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act (introduced after a peerage scandal involving the then prime minister David Lloyd George) because the legislation covers only the most blatant behaviour. \"We've already seen reforms of the honours system,\" said Lord Harris. \"I would also expect people to look at this legislation: whether or not it's fit for purpose, and whether or not something needs to be revised in the light of the experience of this particular set of allegations.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
