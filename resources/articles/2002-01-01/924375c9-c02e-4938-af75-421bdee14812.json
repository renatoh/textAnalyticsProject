But as a character actor, there's no one better at representing the American military man. From 'Nam TV series China Beach to such high-profile films as Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor, the 37-year-old, Detroit-raised Sizemore has embodied soldiers of various stripes and stars as persuasively as any US actor since the 1940s. In his latest war film, Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down, he plays real-life Colonel Danny McKnight, who drove in and out of the combat zone to save his comrades. You're sure in a lot of war movies. The only reason I've been in so many war movies is because of the good directors who made them. One of the complaints that's been levelled against Black Hawk Down is that people can't tell most of the soldiers apart. I actually think they are differentiated to a large degree. But I also think that movies are so shitty that people expect a product with a soap opera aspect. We're going to get to know Guy One, Guy Two, Guy Three and Guy Four, then we're going to kill them off in order of how much we like them so we can manipulate the audience's emotions. In point of fact, in this movie Ridley is not trying to manipulate your emotions. He's just showing you the way it is. If you don't like it, that's just because you're not used to watching a movie that's made by a dispassionate, but passionately intellectual, observer. Did the real Colonel McKnight tell you much about what happened to him on that raid? He was very forthright with me. I asked him if he felt fear that day. \"Well, I didn't have any time to feel any fear.\" Are you afraid to die? \"No. It's part of my deal. I signed up for this.\" And he had three children and a wife. He said all he thought about that day was getting his guys home. I don't know many men like that. I'm not like that guy, I'm not a hero. Actors go to work in limousines. Guess it's safe to say you're a big supporter of the military. Especially in light of recent events. Thank God, or thank whomever you want to thank, there are men and women out there who are willing to die for the freedom we have, not just in the US, but in the west. Not that the US or the west is right or wrong, but we probably wouldn't be here talking like this if we were in a totalitarian system. Of course, it's impossible to watch the film now without somehow relating it to September 11 and its aftermath. Your feelings? There are reasons why we're not liked, America. But it was an obscene attack and it can't be punished enough. There's not a punishment fit enough for the people who put it together and funded it. I worked there for three years, on the 44th floor; I'm a little impassioned about this. Impassioned is your favourite word. But is it possible for an actor to apply it to his career choices in today's Hollywood? Pop culture has become somewhat silly. I took Red Planet, that was not a serious movie, and I knew I wasn't doing something important, but I don't think it sounds pretentious to say that I knew Private Ryan was a serious and important movie. There's room for breezy entertainment. I want Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan to do another one. But I also want Ridley Scott to make an unsparing, very brutal, harsh battle movie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
