With their bright livery and bells, the fire trucks feel like the priests of this anniversary, swooping up and down the aisles of a giant church, calling the grateful to prayer. Meanwhile, in a club in Hell's Kitchen, the night before 9/11 is marked with a very different sort of gathering. Literally the first words I hear from the stage when I step through the door of LibertyFest are: \"If you're one of those people who believe everything the government tells you about what happened on 9/11, you're a fucking moron.\" Activist Adam Kokesh is in full flight. He claims the attacks of 11 September had a goal, \"and the goal was to make America look like it does today\". Angry whoops from the floor. This is a gathering of people who are extremely unhappy about what America looks like today. Although their anger is softened by the setting: a cavernous industrial disco, with Night Fever glitterballs, skittering neon lights and shimmering roofhangings. Kokesh ended his talk on an upswing, celebrating the liberties that citizens have today: \"how awesome to be a human being in 2011\" he opined, to happier whoops. A tour of the disco revealed LibertyFest as a loose gathering of activist groups, each with their trestle table of shirts and leaflets: we had constitutionalists and silver sellers, free marketeers and \"Manhattan Libertarians\". Lots of fans of Ron Paul. No fans of the Federal Reserve. Behind one spread of books and badges was Sheriff Richard Mack. I dragged him outside for a chat before his speech. Mack is a former sheriff from Arizona, and on the board of directors of \"Oathkeepers\", a movement which encourages military and peace officers to stand by the oath they swore to uphold the constitution. And this, he tells me, is the yardstick by which he judges any politician or president: \"Who will keep his oath of office?\" Not Obama, any more than Bush, it would seem. The word \"Libya\" cuts Mack like a knife. \"It's unconstitutional. There is a constitutional way to go to war, but we've not followed it since world war two.\" And 9/11? Mack shakes his large head sorrowfully. \"It's not been properly investigated. When the government acts like it has something to hide, it makes people suspicious.\" I remember thinking exactly that when President Bush proudly announced that the original commission would be overseen by none other than (drumroll please) Henry Kissinger. Talk about alarm bells. Fortunately, too many conflicts of interest took Henry's crabbed hand off the tiller, but still \u2026 I ask Mack if he thinks the government is hiding things about 9/11. \"Certainly. When you look at how the evidence from people inside the towers has been ignored. When you look at how Building 7 came down. I was in law enforcement for twenty years, and I would dearly love to be on a commission to reinvestigate 9/11.\" Don't hold your breath, sheriff. Just a few days ago, it was revealed by Reuters that \"the vast majority of the 9/11 Commission's investigative records remain sealed at the National Archives in Washington, even though the commission had directed the archives to make most of the material public in 2009\". Might this be a better place to start? \u2013 the actual findings of the commission that did (in whatever fashion) investigate the terror attacks. It's what historians of 9/11 \u2013 which is what the activists and investigators essentially are \u2013 value most: the paper trail. Documents, statements, memos. This is the grist of history. And if some of the 9/11 activists can tend, sometimes, towards the obsessive, it's generally an obsession with data. And to have that data withheld? It's murder. So when, at the tail end of LibertyFest, longtime 9/11 activist Luke Rudkowski tells me of the 2.5 terabytes of data from the Able Danger terror investigations that were deleted, it's with genuine pain in his eyes. It's a Ming vase that's smashed on the floor. It's Wayne Rooney looking at a squashed banana. It's a tragedy. I asked Rudkowski what the \"Truthers\" were planning for the day. \"This year, we're all about paying our respects to the dead. We're sending out a solemn message: we don't know what happened on 9/11, yes we have questions, but on the day we're not asking them. We're going to stand in respectful silence.\" But on the night before, Rudkowski is happy to ask. Why, from the 78 security cameras that surround the Pentagon, have we been shown just a few blurry frames? Why has the FBI classified its official investigation into the fact that some of the hijackers were trained at US military bases\u2026? And what would he say to those who'd scoff at asking such questions? \"I'd say, look at the evidence and make up your own mind. And remember, 9/11 is a gigantic event that's going to affect us all for the next hundred years, but it's an event a lot of people know very little about.\" And with that, I slid away from the party, and bought some toothpaste from a late night store. I'm not going to mark the tenth anniversary of 9/11 with dirty teeth. I'm glad that the New York Truthers aren't planning anything big and brash for the anniversary. The living will still have their questions, documents will need to be declassified, evidence sifted and lies challenged, but the anniversary of 9/11 is about the dead. The truth can take the day off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
