Gary Grant, the founder and chairman of The Entertainer, said toy retailers usually sell \u00a3500m worth of toys during November, which was as big in sales terms as takings over the three months of the spring lockdown put together. \u201cWe could lose as much turnover in four weeks as we lost in 12,\u201d he explained. The stakes are even higher in December when the dash to the shops for favourites such as Lego, LOL Surprise! dolls and Nerf guns, accounts for a quarter of the country\u2019s annual \u00a33.6bn toy sales. If the lockdown creates pent-up demand, toy chains fear they will be unable to make up lost ground when shops are allowed to reopen due to the constraints put on trade by social distancing rules. \u201cI would ask Boris Johnson if Father Christmas is a key worker because if he is we are going to need a little bit of help because some of this stuff comes from our shops,\u201d said Grant. \u201cCoronavirus or not, children won\u2019t understand why their parcel is late.\u201d If a big chunk of the toy trade now moves online there is concern that retailers and courier services, some of which are already said to be operating at capacity, will not be able to fulfil orders. \u201cWe saw our internet sales rise by 500% in April,\u201d Grant said of his family-owned business. \u201cWhat is going to defeat us in this period is capacity. If everybody spins to the internet, which is what happened during the first lockdown, the internet itself won\u2019t fall over but the ability of people to pick, pack, and then deliver cartons is going to be challenging.\u201d The lifestyle changes forced upon Britons by the pandemic has actually been good news for toy retailers, with sales up 7% in the first seven months of the year, according to the market researchers NPD. Unlike the start of the first lockdown, the government this time has made it clear that non-essential retailers can still sell online and operate click-and-collect services. Many retailers are now channeling all their energies into online sales but Grant said they would struggle to offset store closures. \u201cWe will not be able to replace all of our business,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have 173 shops closed and expect the internet and click-and-collect to replace them. That\u2019s just not possible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
