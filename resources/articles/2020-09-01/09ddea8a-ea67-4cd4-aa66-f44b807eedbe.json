We have started a new blog where you can continue to follow the latest developments in Australia and around the world. You can follow that here. There\u2019s a summary below of what has happened over the past few hours Thanks for reading, and stay safe. The Australian state of Victoria recorded 37 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest for months, as it also braces for illegal anti-lockdown protests and potential arrests. Brazil\u2019s death toll passed 130,000, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. It has the second highest death toll in the world, after the US. France has ruled out imposing a new national lockdown despite recording more than 9,000 new cases for the second consecutive day. Instead the prime minister, Jean Gastex, announced an increase in test and trace measures and a reduction the quarantine period for those with the virus from 14 to seven days. Spain has reported 4,708 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours. It brings its cumulative total to 566,326 \u2013 the highest in western Europe. A further 3,539 people have tested positive in the UK, the largest daily figure since mid-May. It was also announced that the R value for both the UK and England is between 1 and 1.2. The US government\u2019s infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said he disagrees with President Donald Trump\u2019s assessment that the country has \u201crounded the corner\u201d on the coronavirus pandemic, saying the statistics are disturbing. The first European pandemic \u201ctravel bubble\u201d, created in May by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, has burst after Latvia said it was mandating a 14-day quarantine on everyone arriving from Estonia. Iraq has recorded another 4,254 new cases and 67 more deaths from the virus. Despite the recent surge in cases, thousands of supporters of Iraqi shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gathered at a mosque in east Baghdad for the first time since March. India has set another global one-day record for coronavirus infections. The country reported 96,551 new cases. Deaths have remained relatively low in the country, but are seeing an upward trend, with more than 1,000 deaths being reported every day for the last ten days. Global infections have passed 28.2m and deaths stand at 911,282,according to Johns Hopkins data. The first four countries in terms of infections, the US, India, Brazil and Russia, account for nearly 58% of all cases. Austria has expanded mandatory mask-wearing and imposed restrictions on events in response to a surge in new cases. In the UK, the Covid-19 smartphone app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September. Hi all, it\u2019s Naaman Zhou here taking over the blog. Thanks to Nadeem Badshah for his work earlier today. The Australian state of Victoria has just put out its Covid-19 numbers for today. The state has recorded 37 new cases and six new deaths over the past 24 hours. That\u2019s one of the lowest new case totals for months. Coronavirus cases in Colombia surpassed 700,000 on Friday as deaths from the virus climbed toward 23,000. The Andean country has 702,088 confirmed cases of the virus according to the health ministry, with 22,518 reported deaths. Active cases number 95,398. Colombia began its months-long lockdown in March. It is now in a much-looser \u201cselective\u201d quarantine phase and making plans to restart international flights. Intensive care units in Bogota are at about 62% capacity, according to local health authorities. The capital is home to a third of Colombia\u2019s cases. It\u2019s Saturday morning in Australia and Melbourne is bracing itself for more anti-lockdown protests planned for today, after 17 people were arrested last week. A \u201cfreedom walk\u201d is planned for 11am today in the city, as well as other protests, despite the strong warnings of police and the state\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews. Andrews told protesters on Friday that \u201cAll you\u2019re potentially doing is spreading the virus\u201d. The assistant commissioner of police, Luke Cornelius, went even further saying \u201cI feel a bit like a dog returning to eat his own vomit.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sick of it,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the chairman of St Basil\u2019s Homes for the Aged in Fawkner, where 44 residents died, has stood down. The Melbourne aged care home recorded the single most deaths in aged care of the pandemic so far. Federal data has also emerged this morning showing that 95 per cent of Australia\u2019s coronavirus aged care deaths have occurred in Victoria. Brazil\u2019s death toll has passed 130,000, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. The figure has reached 130,396 in total compared to 129,522 yesterday. The number of confirmed cases in the country has reached 4,282,164, compared to 4,238,446 yesterday. In terms of cases, the country is the third worst affected after the US which has around 6.4 million followed by India which has 4.5 million which overtook Brazil earlier this week. Brazil also has the second highest death toll in the world after the US. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Congress passing coronavirus relief legislation before the Nov. 3 presidential election. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic. I do think that we should have an agreement,\u201d Pelosi said in a CNN interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what we all want.\u201d It comes after Trump voiced opposition to another massive coronavirus relief package a day after the Senate failed to pass the Republican \u201cskinny\u201d relief bill. Melbourne residents are experiencing some of the strictest and longest coronavirus lockdown measures in the world as Victoria continues to work to contain a second wave of Covid-19 infections. An overnight curfew from 8pm to 5am is in place, leaving the streets of a once thriving city deserted. Saturday\u2019s Mirror splash in the UK. The Telegraph\u2019s front page. Saturday\u2019s Times front page. A selection of Saturday\u2019s front pages in the UK, starting with the FT. How vaccine hesitancy could undermine Australia\u2019s Covid response. A piece on a New South Wales town, which is the country\u2019s counter-culture capital. US hospitals turned down about a third of their allocated supplies of the Covid-19 drug remdesivir since July as need for the costly antiviral wanes, according to unpublished government statistics provided to Reuters by a pharmacists\u2019 group. Some hospitals said they are still buying the Gilead Sciences medicine to build inventory in case the pandemic accelerates over the winter. But they said current supplies are adequate, in part because they are limiting use to severely ill patients. The Food and Drug Administration has allowed more liberal remdesivir use, but 6 out of 8 major hospital systems contacted by Reuters said they were not using it for moderate cases. The slowdown suggests that a shortage of the drug is over and threatens Gilead\u2019s efforts to expand use of remdesivir, which it sells under the brand name Veklury in some countries. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told hospitals and other healthcare organisations on Friday that between July 6 and September 8, state and territory public health systems accepted about 72% of the remdesivir they were offered, Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, told Reuters. Hospitals in turn took only about two-thirds of what states and territories accepted, he added. It was not immediately clear what happened to the surplus supplies. France has ruled out imposing a new national lockdown despite recording more than 9,000 new cases for the second consecutive day. Instead the prime minister, Jean Gastex, announced an increase in test and trace measures and a reduction the quarantine period for those with the virus from 14 to seven days. There were 80 deaths in the past 24 hours from the virus, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. The total is now 30,893. Spain has reported 4,708 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours. It brings its cumulative total to 566,326 - the highest in western Europe. A further 3,539 people have tested positive in the UK, the largest daily figure since mid-May. It was also announced that the R value for both the UK and England is between 1 and 1.2.

Prime minister Krisjanis Karins said: \u201cI do not think that society is ready to allow more people to enter Latvia.\u201d Iraq has recorded another 4,254 new cases and 67 more deaths from the virus. Despite the recent surge in cases, thousands of supporters of Iraqi shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gathered at a mosque in east Baghdad for the first time since March. India has set another global one-day record for coronavirus infections. The country reported 96,551 new cases. Deaths have remained relatively low in the country, but are seeing an upward trend, with more than 1,000 deaths being reported every day for the last ten days. The country\u2019s total reported cases are 4,562,414, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and deaths stand at 76,271. Global infections have passed 28.2m and deaths stand at 911,282, according to Johns Hopkins data. The first four countries in terms of infections, the US, India, Brazil and Russia, account for nearly 58% of all cases. Austria has expanded mandatory mask-wearing and imposed restrictions on events in response to a surge in new cases. Announcing the rules, chancellor Sebastian Kurz said: \u201cIt is getting serious again. The numbers have kept rising in recent weeks.\u201d The Covid-19 smartphone app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the launch would be a \u201cdefining moment\u201d in the fight against the virus. In South Korea, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported 176 new cases of Covid-19 as of midnight on Thursday, bringing the total number of infections to 21,919, with 350 deaths. Intensive care medics were significantly less likely to have been infected with Covid-19 than cleaners and other healthcare workers in departments deemed lower risk, according to a study of several British hospitals at the peak of the pandemic. More from Dr Fauci who said it would probably take another year before life returns to a sense of \u201cnormality\u201d in the US even if a coronavirus vaccine is approved in the coming months. The coronavirus death toll in Mexico is primed to hit 70,000 when official data is released on Friday. And excess mortality data from mid-March through early August indicates that the total number of deaths beyond the official count is likely tens of thousands higher. On Thursday, the health ministry announced that 652,364 infections and 69,649 deaths have been attributed to the strain of the coronavirus that was first detected late last year in China. Based on official data, Mexico is the nation with the fourth highest number of deaths globally, and the 13th highest on a per capita basis, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. But earlier this month, the health ministry said it recorded more than 120,000 \u201cextra\u201d deaths from mid-March through August 1. The measure compares mortality figures this year with a four-year average from 2015 to 2018. Twelve children who likely contracted Covid-19 at three childcare operations in the US infected some of their parents and siblings, according to a study, adding to evidence that young kids can transmit the disease. Previous studies had suggested children aged 10 years or older can efficiently transmit the virus in school settings. The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published on Friday found that much younger children can also spread the virus, including a case of an 8-month-old who apparently infected both parents. From the 12 documented cases acquired at the childcare facilities in Utah, virus transmission was found among at least 12 of 46 non-facility contacts, such as parents - one of whom required hospitalisation - siblings and an aunt. Transmission was observed from two of three children with confirmed, asymptomatic Covid-19, researchers found, further evidence that those without symptoms can spread the virus. From April 1 to July 10, Salt Lake County identified 17 childcare facilities, including daycare centres and day camps, with at least two confirmed Covid-19 cases within a 14-day period. Data in the CDC report involves only outbreaks in three of these. At two of the facilities, the researchers traced the primary infection to staff members exposed to Covid-19 through a family member. There were 80 deaths in the past 24 hours from the virus in France, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. The total is now 30,893. A tweet from the WHO\u2019s director general on the potential Covid-19 vaccines. The US government\u2019s infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci. said he disagrees with President Donald Trump\u2019s assessment that the country has \u201crounded the corner\u201d on the coronavirus pandemic, saying the statistics are disturbing. Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the US was starting the flu season with a high baseline of around 40,000 new cases a day and deaths are averaging around 1,000 daily. Trump, who has admitted playing down the severity of the virus since it emerged early this presidential election year, said on Thursday he believed the United States was \u201crounding the corner\u201d on the crisis. \u201cI have to disagree with that, because, if you look at the thing that you just mentioned, the statistics ... they are disturbing,\u201d Fauci said on MSNBC. Fauci said he hoped the country did not see a spike in cases after the Labor Day weekend as it did after other long holiday weekends since May. It was important to get those infection rates down before the autumn and winter seasons when people will be spending more time indoors. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to start off already with a baseline that\u2019s so high,\u201d he added. Asked about the outdoor campaign rallies Trump has resumed before his November 3rd matchup against Democrat Joe Biden, Fauci said they are \u201cabsolutely\u201d risky. \u201cJust because you\u2019re outdoors does not mean that you\u2019re protected, particularly if you\u2019re in a crowd and you\u2019re not wearing masks,\u201d he said. Fauci, who has contradicted Trump\u2019s statements about the virus, denies the administration is pressuring him to keep quiet. \u201cAnybody that tries to tell me what to say publicly, if they know anything about me, realizes that\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. \u201cNo one is ever going to pressure me or muzzle me to say anything publicly.\u201d All five intensive care beds dedicated to Covid patients are in use at the Laveran Military Training Hospital in Marseille, and its doctors are bracing for more. France\u2019s Prime Minister Jean Castex warned Friday that virus situation was worsening in the country. \u201cFor the first time in many weeks, we are noting a substantial increase in the number of hospitalised people\u201d, Castex said. The Laveran hospitals medical staff suit up to enter the Covid zone, hook patients up to monitors and tubes for hydration, nourishment and medicine, and meet frequently to discuss their prognosis. The 70 ICU beds dedicated to virus patients in Frances second-biggest city and the surrounding Bouches-du-Rhone region were all occupied by Tuesday. And the number of ICU virus patients in the region has doubled in the past 10 days and now surpasses 100. France has ruled out imposing a new national lockdown despite recording more than 9,000 new cases for the second consecutive day. Instead the prime minister, Jean Gastex, announced an increase in test and trace measures and a reduction the quarantine period for those with the virus from 14 to seven days. Spain has reported 4,708 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours. It brings its cumulative total to 566,326 - the highest in western Europe. A further 3,539 people have tested positive in the UK, the largest daily figure since mid-May. It was also announced that the R value for both the UK and England is between 1 and 1.2. The first European pandemic \u201ctravel bubble\u201d, created in May by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, has burst after Latvia said it was mandating a 14-day quarantine on everyone arriving from Estonia. Prime minister Krisjanis Karins said: \u201cI do not think that society is ready to allow more people to enter Latvia.\u201d Iraq has recorded another 4,254 new cases and 67 more deaths from the virus. Despite the recent surge in cases, thousands of supporters of Iraqi shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gathered at a mosque in east Baghdad for the first time since March. India has set another global one-day record for coronavirus infections. The country reported 96,551 new cases. Deaths have remained relatively low in the country, but are seeing an upward trend, with more than 1,000 deaths being reported every day for the last ten days. The country\u2019s total reported cases are 4,562,414, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and deaths stand at 76,271. Global infections have passed 28.2m and deaths stand at 911,282, according to Johns Hopkins data. The first four countries in terms of infections, the US, India, Brazil and Russia, account for nearly 58% of all cases. Austria has expanded mandatory mask-wearing and imposed restrictions on events in response to a surge in new cases. Announcing the rules, chancellor Sebastian Kurz said: \u201cIt is getting serious again.

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the launch would be a \u201cdefining moment\u201d in the fight against the virus. In South Korea, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported 176 new cases of Covid-19 as of midnight on Thursday, bringing the total number of infections to 21,919, with 350 deaths. Intensive care medics were significantly less likely to have been infected with Covid-19 than cleaners and other healthcare workers in departments deemed lower risk, according to a study of several British hospitals at the peak of the pandemic. The health authorities in France have reported a daily rise in cases of 9,406, according to French media. This is just below the record daily rise of 9,843 cases announced on Thursday. Restrictions on private indoor gatherings across the west of Scotland have now been extended to Lanarkshire, the Scottish government has announced. The restrictions will apply from midnight and will be the same as for those already in place for more than 1.1 million people living in Glasgow City, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, East Dunbartonshire and West Dunbartonshire. The restrictions mean that people should not meet with individuals from other households indoors, whether in the affected local authority areas or elsewhere. Members of up to two households, and up to a maximum of six people, can continue to meet outdoors, including in gardens, and in hospitality settings, provided all existing guidance is followed. At her daily briefing on Friday, Sturgeon confirmed that an additional 39 people had tested positive for the virus in Lanarkshire since Thursday, with 205 positive cases since 4 September. The restrictions, which were recommended by the National Incident Management Team chaired by Public Health Scotland, will apply to people living in or visiting the North and South Lanarkshire local authority areas \u2013 which are home to more than 660,000 people - and will be reviewed in seven days. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that it was \u201cclearly regrettable\u201d that the restrictions had to be extended and asked everyone in the affected areas to be \u201cextra vigilant\u201d. She added: I understand that this will not be welcome news for people living in these areas, especially ahead of the weekend, but we must act now to protect people and get more control over the virus in the area\u201d. Local public health teams have looked at where cases are being identified and, by restricting indoor meetings, we are helping to protect those who are most at risk from Covid-19 - as they are more likely to be meeting others in a household setting rather than in a public setting. Spain has reported 4,708 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, bringing its cumulative total to 566,326 \u2013 the highest in western Europe. Reuters notes that Spain has been regularly revising up its daily tallies. While Friday\u2019s figure was a new record for initial infection reports since the end of its strict lockdown in June, it was below recent peaks seen in those revised tallies. A week ago, for example, the initially reported figure was 4,500 but that was later revised up to more than 11,000. Spain also registered six new deaths on Friday, bringing its total Covid-19 death toll to 29,747. However, the health emergency chief, Fernando Simon, said on Thursday there seemed to be a slowdown in contagion in half the country\u2019s provinces in the last few days, and Spain could be looking at a stabilisation of new infections. Recent infections have been more common among younger people who often develop no symptoms thanks to their stronger immune systems. The death toll, although back at levels last seen in late May, remains far below the March-April highs when daily fatalities often exceeded 800. Since the restrictions on movement were lifted and mass testing began in late June, infections rose from a few hundred a day to thousands, outstripping other hard-hit countries such as Britain, Italy and France. It has been a grim day for Covid figures in the UK, writes Nicola Davis. Several datasets released today have shown the same trend: there is a resurgence in coronavirus in the UK. Now the increase has been underscored by the latest figures, which show a further 3,539 people have tested positive for Covid-19: the largest daily figure since mid-May and more than a 20% rise on yesterday\u2019s figure of 2,919 new cases. While testing has increased since May, that alone does not explain the recent surge. A Guardian analysis of the seven-day average of cases by specimen date per 1,000 tests also shows a steep rise in recent weeks. The news comes as the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies reveals the R value for both the UK and England is between 1 and 1.2 \u2013 although they caution these numbers reflect the situation over the past weeks, given time lags in the range of data used. More recent data from a survey called React-1, albeit based on 136 positive swabs out of more than 150,000 collected, reveals the R value in England to be about 1.7, with cases doubling roughly every eight days. Experts say the rise is not confined to hotspots, although the increase in prevalence is greater in some regions than others, nor is it confined to hospitals and care homes. Whichever way you look at it, Covid-19 is spreading. AFP has more on the announcement by the French prime minister, Jean Castex, not to impose a new lockdown. It quotes him as saying: We have to succeed in living with this virus, without returning to the idea of a generalised lockdown. Our strategy is not changing. We must fight the virus without putting on hold our social, cultural and economic life, the education of our children and our ability to live normally. Castex said 42 of France\u2019s 101 departments were now classified as \u201cred zones\u201d where the virus was circulating rapidly, up from 28 earlier this week. \u201cThere is no Maginot Line - inevitably it ends up reaching the most vulnerable,\u201d he said, referring to the supposedly unbreakable defences France built before the second world war. But he did not announce any major new restrictions, urging people instead to respect social distancing guidelines and use face masks. And the quarantine period for people with the virus would be shortened to just seven days from 14, to better match \u201cthe period when there is a real risk of contagion,\u201d Castex said. The move is a tacit acknowledgement that enforcing quarantines has proven nearly impossible, given the number of new cases. Castex also said testing capacities would be ramped up in response to long waiting times for appointments and results. Priority cases involving people with confirmed exposure to Covid-19 patients or already showing symptoms will be given reserved spots at testing centres, and 2,000 more people will be hired to carry out contact tracing. The UK government is facing a mounting backlash from Tory MPs over its new \u201crule of six\u201d law, including its refusal to follow Scotland and Wales in exempting younger children, amid reports that cabinet ministers were split over the measures. Boris Johnson unveiled new rules on Wednesday to replace existing guidance and make it illegal for groups of more than six to gather indoors or outdoors in England from Monday, slashing the current legal limit of 30, following a surge in Covid-19 cases. But, announcing Scotland\u2019s own version of the new measures on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon said under-12s would be exempt and, on Friday, the Welsh government made the same move for under-11s. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said groups of up to 30 could continue to meet outdoors because \u201cwe see no evidence here that coronavirus is being transmitted between people when they meet in the fresh air\u201d. It has prompted calls from Tory MPs, some of whom fear the rules are too draconian and risk criminalising people for exercising basic freedoms, to call for a rethink. Here\u2019s some reaction to the lack of action announced by Castex. France\u2019s prime minister, Jean Castex, has said his government is not planning a new nationwide lockdown, despite a record surge in new cases. Instead he announced a series of less drastic measures. He said these would include fast-tracked testing for priority cases and giving local authorities the power to make some businesses reduce opening hours. Castex said people had \u201clet down their guard over the summer\u201d, according to a translation on France 24. \u201cI call on everyone to act as civically as possible,\u201d he added. He said the French government would employ 2,000 more health officials to help trace people who had been in contact with those who had tested positive. Castex announced that those who had tested positive would have to isolate for only seven days instead of 14. He said this reflected when people were infectious, adding: \u201cWe call on people to respect these seven days to the letter.\u201d Castex expressed particular concern about a rise in cases, especially among older people, in Marseilles, Bordeaux and Guadeloupe. Health authorities reported 9,843 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Thursday, beating by almost 900 a previous record of 8,975, which was set six days earlier. The UK has reported 3,539 confirmed new cases, the biggest daily rise since 17 May. There\u2019s more on the UK coronavirus live blog. Greece\u2019s death toll from the virus has reached 300, the state health agency said, as the total number of infections topped 12,700, AFP reports. The Eody agency said 287 new cases were confirmed on Friday, a day after an all-time record of 372 infections in 24 hours was announced. More than half of the country\u2019s 12,734 infections since the pandemic began were recorded in August, mostly among Greeks. The increase has been attributed to large gatherings in violation of social distancing rules. Greece\u2019s civil protection agency has made masks compulsory in all indoor public areas. The government has ruled out a general lockdown after gradually reopening the economy in May, while foreign visitors have been allowed in since June in hopes of salvaging part of the economically vital tourism season. Armenia has said its land borders would remain closed until January, AFP reports. Foreign nationals will not be able to cross Armenia\u2019s land borders until 11 January and public gatherings of more than 60 people will also be banned into the new year. Mask-wearing will also remain mandatory in enclosed public spaces, the government said in a statement. The restrictions are being imposed to halt the \u201cspread of the disease in Armenia\u201d and protect public health, the government said. But the former Soviet country did not extend a state of emergency, which was declared in March and ended on Friday. With a population of about 3 million, Armenia has registered 45,503 coronavirus cases and 909 deaths. In June, the prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan \u2013 who has himself tested positive and later recovered \u2013 denounced widespread quarantine violations. Armenia\u2019s neighbour Georgia \u2013 among the world\u2019s least affected countries \u2013 postponed on Friday the reopening of schools in big cities until 1 October after registering a surge in the number of new coronavirus cases. The first European pandemic \u201ctravel bubble\u201d, created in May by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, has burst after Latvia said it was mandating a 14-day quarantine on everyone arriving from Estonia, Reuters reports. Estonia has had 21 infections per 100,000 population over the previous two weeks, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, passing the 16 threshold set by Latvia for mandatory quarantine. Latvia, which has one of the lowest levels of infection in the European Union, has rejected the European commission\u2019s recommendation to raise threshold for quarantine to 25 new cases per 100,000 population over two weeks. Prime minister Krisjanis Karins said: This is a decision I am not ready for \u2026 I do not think that society is ready to allow more people to enter Latvia. In a bid to curb the rising spread of the virus, Lithuania reintroduced the requirement to wear face masks inside public buildings and announced restrictions on public gatherings. \u201cWe relaxed and began travelling, gathering together, interacting more. Since the virus was never totally exterminated, so it began spreading\u201d, Lithuanian minister of health Aurelijus Veryga said. In about 15 minutes, France\u2019s prime minister, Jean Castex, is due to announce new measures to tackle the spread of the virus after a record surge in infections. AFP has this preview: Officials have been increasingly concerned about the high number of infections in France, even if the death toll and admissions to intensive care are way below the highs recorded in March and April. However, there is no indication Castex will announce restrictions as severe as the nationwide two-month lockdown France experienced from March to May at the peak of the epidemic. The health ministry said 9,843 new coronavirus infections were recorded on Thursday, the highest number since large-scale testing began. France\u2019s total death toll from the pandemic stands at 30,813. Jean-Francois Delfraissy, the head of the scientific council advising the government on the pandemic, said Wednesday that \u201ctough\u201d decisions may be required at the meeting. People at high risk because of old age or health problems including diabetes, obesity and respiratory issues may require a protective \u201cbubble\u201d around them. There was the danger of a \u201cvery rapid, exponential rise\u201d in some places, Delfraissy said, singling out the French Riviera and Provence regions. Castex himself is in a seven-day period of self-isolation, having spent part of last weekend with the boss of the Tour de France Christian Prudhomme, who tested positive for Covid-19. Iraq has recorded another 4,254 new cases and 67 more deaths from the virus. Despite the recent surge in cases, thousands of supporters of Iraqi shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gathered at a mosque in east Baghdad for the first time since March (see earlier). Switzerland has announced that people travelling from part of France and Austria will need to be quarantined because of rising coronavirus cases there, but exempted immediate border regions, AFP reports. Switzerland considers that countries that count more than 60 new daily Covid-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for 14 consecutive days are at-risk, and reserves the right to impose restrictions, including a 10-day quarantine. Neighbouring France passed that bar at the end of August, sparking concern that border closures could be looming. Swiss health minister Alain Berset told a news conference that the government had decided to place nine of 13 French regions, including Paris, on its at-risk list, as well as Vienna in neighbouring Austria. \u201cWe have seen a number of new infections in France, which are today already higher that the numbers in March and April,\u201d he said, stressing that \u201cthis is a situation to take seriously \u2026 We\u2019re trying to keep the pandemic under control.\u201d At the same time, he said, the government had sought a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach and thus exempted the border regions in France and other neighbouring countries from the order, set to take effect from Monday. Switzerland has recorded a steady rise in cases in recent months. The country of 8.5 million people has counted more than 46,000 cases of coronavirus and over 1,700 deaths. Daily case numbers regularly topped 1,000 in March, before dropping to single digits in mid-June. Since then, they have steadily risen, and on Friday topped 500 for the first time since April. A Black man who is going to trial for murder in the US must wear a mask even though he thinks it could prejudice jurors against him, a judge ruled, AP reports. Carine Reeves, of New York, contended that a mask would subject him to racial profiling and stereotyping by jurors who associate masks with criminals. Court rules require everyone in a courtroom to wear a mask during the coronavirus pandemic. Justice Harold Stewart II said jurors will understand why Reeves and all others in the courtroom are wearing masks. And Reeves could be subjected to undue attention if he were the only one without a mask, the judge said. \u201cDuring this pandemic, the court cannot think of a greater state interest than taking measures that prevent the spread of the virus, for everyone\u2019s health and safety,\u201d the judge wrote on Thursday in his decision. Reeves is charged with murder in the 2017 killing of Sally Shaw, who was shot in the head and left on the side of a road in Cherryfield, in eastern Maine. The trial, scheduled to begin later this month, is the first murder trial in Maine since the pandemic reduced courthouse hours and delayed trials. Reeeves\u2019 attorney, Stephen Smith, had pointed to a study by North Carolina researchers who wrote, African Americans are particularly prone to racial profiling solely due to the fact that they are wearing masks. The National Institute for Public Health in the Netherlands has announced 1,270 new infections, the highest daily rise since the second week of April. The news site De Volkskrant says there have only ever been two days, on 10 and 11 April, when there has been a higher daily increase in the number of confirmed infections. It adds that the number of new infections recorded this week was 6,573 compared with 4,077 last week. Health authorities in Thailand have confirmed another coronavirus infection in an Uzbek professional footballer, eight days after the virus resurfaced following a more than three-month absence, Reuters reports. The unnamed man tested positive after a mandatory pre-match test on Tuesday, despite having completed quarantine on 27 August after three prior negative tests, health officials said. The 29-year-old player arrived in Thailand on 13 August. Yong Poovorawan, a virology expert from Bangkok\u2019s Chulalongkorn University, said the virus incubation period in the man would have been longer than 14 days and it was unlikely to have been domestically transmitted. \u201cI believe he was infected abroad,\u201d Yong said. By sealing off the country to all but returning Thai nationals and approved foreigners, and requiring all arrivals to quarantine, Thailand has kept the number of coronavirus cases to 3,461, the vast majority of which have recovered. The country has reported 58 deaths. It had been more than 100 days without a domestic infection until a mysterious case appeared in Bangkok last week, with no travel history or known exposure to the virus. Authorities have since tested hundreds of people who may have come in contact with the man, a DJ who was recently imprisoned. There were 43 other people potentially exposed to the Uzbek footballer but all had tested negative for the virus and were undergoing quarantine, said Sophon Iamsirithaworn, the director of the bureau of general communicable diseases, adding that a further 27 individuals would be tested. Cases of coronavirus in England are doubling every seven to eight days, research has revealed in the latest figures to show a resurgence of Covid-19. The study, known as React-1, is a population surveillance study that began in May and uses swabs from about 120,000 to 160,000 randomly selected people in England across 315 local authority areas each month to track the spread of coronavirus using PCR analysis \u2013 the \u201chave you got it now\u201d test. \u201cThe prevalence of the virus in the population is increasing. We found evidence that it has been accelerating at the end of August and beginning of September,\u201d said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London and a co-author of the work. Finland will allow holidaymakers to visit the country for up to three days in order to help the struggling tourist industry, ministers have announced, AFP reports. Under the new measures, travel restrictions will be eased to allow visitors from Germany, Sweden and other countries with fewer than 25 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past fortnight. Arrivals from countries with higher levels of infection, such as France and the UK, will also be admitted without quarantine requirements if they are travelling with a charter flight or organised tour group, and if their stay does not exceed 72 hours. In recent years, tourist numbers in Lapland, in Finland\u2019s far north, have grown to record levels. Among 3m overnight stays in 2018, British tourists were the largest group. The Finnish government has come under pressure to ease travel restrictions to help businesses in Lapland, where tourism generated \u20ac1bn ($1.1bn) of revenue in 2018 according to the area\u2019s regional council. Finland\u2019s tight border restrictions ban arrivals from all but a handful of EU countries in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The economic affairs minister, Mika Lintila, told a press conference on Friday the new policy \u201cwill bring clarity to the business and tourism sectors\u201d. \u201cThe decision takes into account safety and the needs of business.\u201d The extradition case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will resume on Monday after a Covid-19 scare turned out to be a false alarm, PA Media reports. On Thursday, a hearing at the Old Bailey was brought to a halt amid fears a lawyer for the US government may have been exposed to the virus. Judge Vanessa Baraitser adjourned until Monday so the barrister could be tested for coronavirus. On Friday, it emerged the test result was negative, meaning the case could continue on Monday with the next witness, US lawyer Eric Lewis. Assange is fighting extradition to the US following leaks of hundreds of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011 exposing alleged war crimes and abuse. The 49-year-old, who has been in high-security Belmarsh prison for 16 months, is facing 18 charges \u2013 including plotting to hack computers and conspiring to obtain and disclose national defence information. His defence claim the prosecution under the Donald Trump administration has been politically motivated.The extradition case is due to go on for up to four weeks. India has set another global one-day record for coronavirus infections. The country reported 96,551 new cases. Deaths have remained relatively low in the country, but are seeing an upward trend, with more than 1,000 deaths being reported every day for the last ten days. The country\u2019s total reported cases are 4,562,414, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and deaths stand at 76,271. Global infections have passed 28.2m and deaths stand at 910,134, according to Johns Hopkins data. The first four countries in terms of infections, the US, India, Brazil and Russia, account for nearly 58% of all cases. Austria has expanded mandatory mask-wearing and imposed restrictions on events in response to a surge in new cases. Announcing the rules, chancellor Sebastian Kurz said: \u201cIt is getting serious again. The numbers have kept rising in recent weeks.\u201d The Covid-19 smartphone app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the launch would be a \u201cdefining moment\u201d in the fight against the virus. France recorded almost 10,000 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, its highest ever single-day total, a day before a cabinet meeting that might consider imposing fresh, local lockdowns to curb the spread of the disease. In South Korea, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported 176 new cases of Covid-19 as of midnight on Thursday, bringing the total number of infections to 21,919, with 350 deaths. Intensive care medics were significantly less likely to have been infected with Covid-19 than cleaners and other healthcare workers in departments deemed lower risk, according to a study of several British hospitals at the peak of the pandemic. Austria has responded to an increase in infections by making face-masks compulsory in more places including all shops and school corridors, and limiting the size of private events indoors to 50 people, Reuters reports. Austria quickly brought its first wave of infections under control with an early lockdown in mid-March that it began lifting a month later. However, daily cases have been rising since late June and hit their highest level since late March on Thursday. \u201cIt is getting serious again. The numbers have kept rising in recent weeks,\u201d Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, told a news conference outlining the new measures. \u201cI ask you to be more careful again.\u201d Face masks, currently required on public transport and in shops considered essential such as supermarkets and post offices, will have to be worn in all shops and in schools but not in classrooms. Waiters will also be required to wear them, Kurz said. The new measures take effect from Monday. Events without assigned seating, including private parties, will be limited to 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors. Professionally organised events with assigned seating will be capped at 1,500 people indoors and 3,000 outdoors, slashing the current limits of 5,000 and 10,000. \u201cOur clear aim as a government is to avoid a second lockdown for Austria. We will, however, only succeed if everyone does their part,\u201d Kurz said, adding that measures would be tightened further if infections keep rising. The Covid-19 app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September, said the Department of Health and Social Care. Ahead of the roll-out, businesses including pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas are being urged to ensure they have NHS QR code posters visible on entry so customers who have downloaded the app can use their smartphones to check in. DHSC said ongoing trials in the east London borough of Newham, on the Isle of Wight and with NHS volunteer responders showed the app was \u201chighly effective when used alongside traditional contact tracing to identify contacts of those who have tested positive for coronavirus\u201d. Thousands of supporters of Iraqi shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr have gathered at a mosque in east Baghdad for the first weekly prayers since the onset of the pandemic, AFP reports. Iraq\u2019s mosques have been closed to gatherings for close to six months, but Sadr said on Wednesday he would hold open-air prayers in his stronghold. In east Baghdad\u2019s Sadr City, worshippers put on medical masks and gloves and had their temperatures taken before being allowed into the courtyard of the main mosque, where volunteers were spraying disinfectant. \u201cWe urge everyone to abide by social distancing and protect themselves against this virus,\u201d the imam said in the opening to his brief sermon. Sadr had issued a list of restrictions on Twitter this week, including that worshippers must stand exactly 75cm apart and sermons must last only 15 minutes. One worshipper, Qassem al-Mayahi, 40, said he was \u201chappy to finally be able to pray on Fridays, as this is one of the five pillars of Islam. We need to figure out how to live\u201d with the virus, \u201cwe may as well pray.\u201d Other prayers at Sadrist mosques were expected in the Shia holy city of Najaf on Friday. The coronavirus pandemic has hit Iraq hard, with nearly 280,000 confirmed cases and more than 7,800 deaths. In March, Iraqi authorities shut down airports and imposed total lockdowns to halt the virus\u2019s spread. Top Shia authority Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani halted his weekly sermons, and they have yet to resume. But rules have generally been relaxed, with most airports reopening in July and curfews now only in place overnight. On Monday, the Iraqi government\u2019s coronavirus crisis cell announced restaurants could seat customers \u2013 rather than just providing takeaway services - if they abide by health ministry protocols and that sports events could resume, but in the absence of spectators. The loosening of restrictions came just a few days after Iraq recorded its highest daily caseload yet, with more than 5,000 new Covid-19 infections recorded on 4 September. The United Arab Emirates has announced 931 new cases, its second highest rise in daily cases since a first peak of 994 on 22 May. Iran has announced a further 2,313 cases in the last 24 hours \u2013 the highest daily rise since the 19 August. It also announced a further 115 deaths, taking its total to 22,913. Iran has been reporting at least 100 deaths a day from virus since June. Ninety people have tested positive and eight have died in two care homes in central Switzerland in two of the largest outbreaks seen in retirement facilities, AFP reports. The new clusters come amid a steady rise in cases in the country since mid-June, despite low and stable case numbers compared to its European neighbours. In the Siviriez nursing home in the canton of Fribourg, 37 elderly residents and 19 staff members have tested positive for Covid-19. Seven people have died in the past week, the canton\u2019s authorities said in a statement Thursday. Civil defence forces were called in to help and some sick residents have been moved to hospital as there were no longer enough staff to care for them, it said. In the Maison Bourgeoisiale retirement home in Bulle, also in Fribourg, 21 residents and 13 staff have tested positive, the canton said, adding that one person there had died. Other nursing homes in the canton have seen sporadic cases, it said, adding though that most of those had been among staff members. Switzerland, has so far counted more than 45,000 cases of the novel coronavirus and over 1,700 deaths. And that\u2019s me for today. Please give a big hand to Matthew Weaver, who will guide you safely through the next few hours of breaking news. Americans are commemorating 9/11 amid disputes in New York over coronavirus-safety precautions that led to split-screen remembrances on Friday, the Telegraph is reporting. There will be one site of remembrance at the September 11 memorial plaza at the World Trade Center and another on a nearby corner. The Pentagon\u2019s observance will be so restricted that not even victims\u2019 families can attend, though small groups can visit the memorial there later in the day. Around the country, some communities have canceled 9/11 commemorations because of the pandemic, while others are going ahead, sometimes with modifications. The New York memorial is changing one of its ceremony\u2019s central traditions: having relatives read the names of the dead, often adding poignant tributes. Thousands of family members are still invited. But they\u2019ll hear a recording of the names from speakers spread around the vast plaza, a plan that memorial leaders felt would avoid close contact at a stage but still allow families to remember their loved ones at the place where they died. Vaccines normally require years of testing and additional time to produce at scale, but scientists are hoping to develop a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months. With more than 170 teams of researchers racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine. Track and trace their progress with our Covid vaccine tracker: when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? Donald Trump is citing Churchill and British wartime spirit for reason he \u201cplayed down\u201d coronavirus, the Daily Telegraph is reporting. \u201cAs the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II, Keep Calm and Carry On. That\u2019s what I did,\u201d Trump said. Trump told a rally in Michigan on Thursday night that he was being \u201ccalm\u201d like Churchill in the second world war when he \u201cplayed down\u201d coronavirus to the American public. The US president recalled the famous slogan from a British wartime poster: \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On.\u201d It came as Trump was criticised for having told journalist Bob Woodward that he publicly played down the potential impact of the virus in February and March, despite privately knowing how deadly it was. Joe Biden has accused him of lying to the American people in an \u201calmost criminal\u201d way. US schools that are mostly Black, Latino favour starting online, even outside cities, according to an analysis conducted by the Associated Press and Chalkbeat. Districts where the vast majority of students are white are more than three times as likely to be open for in-person learning than school districts that enroll mostly students of colour. While that stark divide often reflects the preferences of parents, it\u2019s one that could further exacerbate inequities in education, the analysis warned. In every state, the research found that the higher a district\u2019s share of white students, the more likely it is to offer in-person instruction \u2013 a pattern that generally holds across cities, towns, suburbs and rural areas. There are a number of possible explanations for the racial divide. One is politics. Schools in areas that supported President Donald Trump in 2016 are more likely to open in person. Another potential reason is that school officials are responding to families: national and state polls show that Black and Latino parents are more likely to be wary of returning to school in person than white parents. That likely reflects the disparate toll of the pandemic, with people from those communities dying at higher rates from Covid-19. The Telegraph is reporting on a report from Nanjing University Medical School in China that coronavirus antibodies fade after only a month. Understanding antibody responses against Covid-19 is fundamental for the development of effective treatments and a preventive vaccine, experts say. But if antibodies decline overtime it could suggest immunity from a potential vaccine would also fade, rendering it less effective or require boosters. In this latest study published in PLOS Pathogens, researchers from Nanjing University Medical School in China monitored Covid-19 antibody responses in 19 non-severe and seven severe coronavirus patients for seven weeks from disease onset. They found that most patients generated antibody responses against the virus. But only a small portion produced a potent level of antibody neutralisation activity and around one in five (20%) produced no antibody response at all. The New York Times has an interesting read titled: Science Versus Politics\u2019: School District Defies Governor\u2019s Reopening Order In one of the US\u2019s sharpest clashes over school reopening, the paper reports on how officials in Des Moines are saying Iowa\u2019s Republican governor is pushing them to risk public safety. Most state and local officials have found a way to arrive at some sort of plan by the first day of classes. But not in Des Moines, where school began this week with local officials openly defying Iowa\u2019s governor and a judge\u2019s order by teaching remotely. Iowa remains hard hit by the pandemic. Over the past week, the state has had the nation\u2019s third-highest number of new coronavirus cases per capita, according to New York Times tracking data. The decision not to reopen schools puts the district\u2019s funding and administrators\u2019 jobs at risk, and leaves students locked out of athletics and their parents uncertain whether online classes will even count. The conflict is perhaps the nation\u2019s starkest example of the tension between Republican state officials, who have followed the lead of President Trump in pushing schools to reopen classrooms, and local administrators, often in Democratic-leaning cities, who fear that in-person instruction will put students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 health in danger. \u201cIt kind of feels like science versus politics,\u201d the Des Moines schools superintendent, Thomas Ahart, said. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is make this political. What I desperately want to do is to be able to honestly tell my staff and my students and their families that I\u2019m doing everything in my power to keep them safe.\u201d The United Nations independent expert on poverty is warning that the worst impacts from the coronavirus pandemic on poverty are yet to come, and that measures taken by governments to protect people so far have been insufficient. The social safety nets put into place are full of holes, said Olivier De Schutter, a Belgian legal scholar appointed by the UN Human Rights Council as special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. These current measures are generally short-term, the funding is insufficient and many people will inevitably fall between the cracks, AP is reporting De Schutter as stating. His message was directed to world leaders meeting this month for the UN general assembly. He called on them to take more decisive steps to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities, according to a UN statement released Friday. De Schutter said the economic downturn resulting from the pandemic is unprecedented in times of peace since the Great Depression in the 1930s. He warned that a further 176 million people worldwide could fall into poverty, with $3.20 per day being used as the poverty baseline. Even though governments have pledged social schemes to help, the world\u2019s poorest people are often excluded because they don\u2019t have the digital literacy or internet access, he said. In some cases, government programmes are now running out. Families in poverty have by now used up whatever reserves they had and sold their assets, he said. The worst impacts of the crisis on poverty are still to come. Covid world map: which countries have the most Coronavirus cases and deaths? Covid-19 has spread around the planet, sending billions of people into lockdown as health services struggle to cope. Find out where the virus has spread, and where it has been most deadly. AP is running a fascinating feature on how young protesters are forcing Nepal to improve its management of the pandemic. \u201cFor months we stayed home and gave our support to the government obeying the orders, but during the lockdown we realised the incompetence of the government to handle the coronavirus situation,\u201d said Robic Upadhayay, a 29-year-old filmmaker. Upadhayay joined friends locked at home in a social media campaign that quickly organised street protests under the banner \u201cEnough is Enough\u201d, attracting hundreds of thousands of online followers \u2013 a significant feat, Reuter\u2019s said, in a country of 30 million. A social media post from Iih, a 29-year-old high school dropout who previously had campaigned for the rights of ethnic minorities, gathered 400 demonstrators at the first protest. But response from the government did not come quickly. Iih was detained by police and went on repeated hunger strikes until he had to be hospitalised in July. The government finally gave in to the pressure of the growing campaign and signed an agreement with Iih on August 9th to scrap the use of rapid diagnostic tests for coronavirus, and instead rely entirely on the gold-standard PCR tests. The government also agreed to provide better personal protective equipment to front-line health workers treating Covid-19 patients and regular consultations with health experts. It promised better access to medicines, which previously had not reached all the hospitals, and committed to free treatment of Covid-19 patients. The government has increased testing to more than 10,000 daily and has allowed private hospital to do tests. It has also given authority to local district administrations to impose lockdowns and isolate areas of infection. \u201cThe government has taken the demands by the youth positively and has agreed to the demands that are we are able to address. We assure to work together with the youths to combat the disease in the country,\u201d health ministry official Sameer Shrestha said. Coronavirus restrictions on pools and beaches in Hong Kong have left thousands of competitive swimmers out of the water and struggling to stay fit, say Reuters, heralding a downturn for one of the city\u2019s favourite sports at an elite level. The Chinese special administrative region reopened all sports facilities on Friday amid a drop in coronavirus cases but not swimming pools, which have been closed for over six months. Public beaches remain cordoned off with blockades and police standing guard to prevent anyone accessing the ocean. This has puzzled many as there have been no cases of coronavirus transmitted via swimming in Hong Kong and pools have opened in other countries such as Britain and Australia where wider community transmission has been much higher. Hong Kong\u2019s Amateur Swimming Association (HKASA) said the pool closures would seriously affect the training system that develops elite swimmers. \u201cThat will bring catastrophic effect to our elite swimmers in a few years\u2019 time,\u201d it said in an email. A high school senior was arrested on Thursday in Long Island, in the US state of New York, after repeatedly showing up to the building in protest on days he had been scheduled for remote learning. Maverick Stow, 17, was issued a five-day suspension for appearing on Tuesday at William Floyd high school and returned on the following two days, Newsday reported. He said he believes students should be in school five days a week. Officials warned on Wednesday that Stow would be arrested, AP reported, and on Thursday he was arrested by Suffolk county police on a charge of third-degree criminal trespass and told to appear in court on 24 September. If Stow continues to try to attend school in person, the high school will have to close, school spokesperson James Montalto said. \u201cWe are still in the midst of a pandemic and will abide by the regulations set in place by our government and health officials designed to keep our students and staff safe,\u201d Montalto said in a written statement. \u201cAs we have said, Mr Stow\u2019s rights as a student do not surpass the rights of any of our other 8,799 students. Most in-person classes are at capacity, and it would be impossible to have all students back under social distancing guidelines,\u201d Montalto said. The school district said in the statement it was naming Stow and his family because, while it takes student privacy seriously, the student and his family already disclosed the information in public forums. The Associated Press is also identifying Stow because he has spoken publicly. Stow has vowed to continue to attempt to attend school five days per week after his suspension is served. \u201cI don\u2019t feel my son should have been arrested\u201d, said Nora Kaplan-Stow. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t like seeing my son in handcuffs, but I support him 1,000%.\u201d Hungary will not impose blanket school closures to curb the spread of the coronavirus but will aim to protect the most vulnerable elderly as the goal is to keep the economy going, the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, said on Friday. Reuters is reporting that Orban told state radio the mandatory wearing of masks on public transport must be enforced and if necessary mask-wearing would be more widely imposed later. But he said the second wave of the pandemic required a different strategy than the first, which dealt a blow to the economy in March and April. \u201cThe goal now is not for everyone to stay at home, and for the country to come to a standstill. The goal is to protect the ability of the country to keep operating,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said. \u201cWe cannot afford the virus crippling the country again.\u201d In the UK, Conservative former minister Steve Baker told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think it is now time to say that this is not a fit legal environment for the British people. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move to a voluntary system \u2013 unless the government can demonstrate otherwise. \u201cAnd it is time for us to actually start living like a free people, not subjecting ourselves to constantly shifting legal requirements, which I think now no one can fully understand. \u201cIt seems to me the effect of having Covid marshals will be to turn every public space in Britain into the equivalent of going through airport security where we are badgered and directed \u2026 I\u2019m not willing to live like this.\u201d We\u2019re running a story now about how Britain\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic continued in July as shops reopened and manufacturing activity resumed but the economy has recovered little more than half the ground lost since the onset of the crisis. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 6.6% in July, continuing a rebound from the Covid-19 crisis as non-essential shops reopened and lockdown measures were relaxed. The figures come after Britain entered the deepest recession since records began in the three months to June, in an economic decline outstripping any other advanced economy after the UK entered lockdown later than other countries and took longer to relax restrictions. GDP is now 18.6% higher than its lowest ebb in April after the pandemic brought activity around the globe to a standstill. However, it remains 11.7% below the levels recorded in February 2020 before the disease spread to Britain. Myanmar has imposed its toughest measures so far to control the spread of coronavirus, AP is reporting, banning travel out of the country\u2019s biggest city, Yangon, and grounding all domestic flights. Both measures, announced just hours before taking effect, will be in place until 1 October. Until the latest outbreak, Myanmar appeared to have largely been spared from the pandemic but a surge in coronavirus cases that began in August in the western state of Rakhine, has since spread to other parts of the country. Health authorities had already ordered partial lockdowns in 29 of Yangon\u2019s 44 townships, the country\u2019s main transportation hub and transit point. New roadblocks were set up Friday in parts of the city, with some smaller streets closed while main roads remained open. Some might think that these rules and regulations are too restrictive,\u201d said the country\u2019s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. \u201cHowever, if we all obeyed these restrictions strictly for two or three weeks, we can arrive at a situation when this disease would be under control. The health ministry on Friday announced 115 new confirmed cases, bringing the total to 2,265, including 14 dead. The Yangon regional government said the number of locally transmitted cases there from 24 August to Tuesday had reached 656. And it\u2019s Good Morning from Amelia Hill. I\u2019ll be keeping you company as the news rolls over the next few hours. Ukraine registered a record 3,144 new cases of the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s national security council said on Friday, up from a previous record of 2,836 registered on 5 September. The council said a total of 148,756 Covid-19 cases had been recorded in Ukraine as of 11 September, with 3,076 deaths. India has set another global one-day record for coronavirus infections. The country reported 96,551 new cases. Deaths have remained relatively low in the country, but are seeing an upward trend, with more than one thousand deaths being reported every day for the last ten days. The country\u2019s total reported cases are 4,562,414, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and deaths stand at 76,271. Global infections have passed 28m and deaths stand at 909,479, according to Johns Hopkins data. The first four countries in terms of infections, the US, India, Brazil and Russia, account for nearly 58% of all cases. France recorded almost 10,000 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, its highest ever single-day total, a day before a cabinet meeting that might consider imposing fresh, local lockdowns to curb the spread of the disease. The UN has called for an immediate \u201cquantum leap\u201d in funding to fight coronavirus. The secretary general, Antonio Guterres, urged countries to find $15bn over the next three months to fund the ACT-Accelerator programme, a global collaboration for a vaccine and treatments led by the World Health Organization. \u201cEither we stand together or we will be doomed,\u201d Guterres said, calling the virus the \u201cnumber one global security threat\u201d. New Zealand has recorded just one new community case of Covid-19. The person in their 50s is linked to the cluster around the Mt Roskill Evangelical Fellowship group in Auckland. In the Australian state of Victoria, which has had a sizeable outbreak of coronavirus over the past few months, Friday\u2019s number of new cases was 43, with 9 deaths. That means 710 Victorians have now lost their lives to the virus. In South Korea, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported 176 new cases of Covid-19 as of midnight Thursday, bringing the total number of infections to 21,919, with 350 deaths. Intensive care medics were significantly less likely to have been infected with Covid-19 than cleaners and other healthcare workers in departments deemed lower risk, according to a study of several British hospitals at the peak of the pandemic. Global infections have passed 28m and deaths stand at 909,479, according to Johns Hopkins data. The first four countries in terms of infections, the US, India, Brazil and Russia, account for nearly 58% of all cases. Brazil is still to decide if it will join the COVAX Facility, a global Covid-19 vaccine allocation plan co-led by the World Health Organization, the acting health minister said on Thursday. Eduardo Pazuello said the decision was still under consideration. \u201cIf we opt for membership, Brazil could be the biggest contributor,\u201d Pazuello, an active duty Army general, said. Brazil\u2019s was making available its \u201crobust vaccine production capacity\u201d and its experience with universal access to health services and vaccination of the entire population, he said. The decision on joining COVAX is up to President Jair Bolsonaro. The deadline is 18 September. Brazil has recorded 4.2m infections, and nearly 130,000 deaths. Germany has recorded 1,484 new cases of coronavirus, taking the total of confirmed cases in the country to 256,850, and 9,342 deaths. India reported another record daily jump of 96,551 coronavirus cases on Friday, taking its case load to 4.5m, data from the federal health ministry showed. Infections are growing faster in India than anywhere else in the world. Deaths have remained relatively low in the country, but are seeing an upward trend, with more than one thousand deaths being reported every day for the last ten days. On Thursday, 1,209 people died from COVID-19, the ministry said, taking total mortalities to 76,271. And while I\u2019m focussing on the region region, New Zealand has recorded just one new community case of Covid-19 in today. The person in their 50s is linked to the cluster around the Mt Roskill Evangelical Fellowship group in Auckland. In the Australian state of Victoria, which has had a sizeable outbreak of coronavirus over the past few months, today\u2019s number of new cases is 43, with 9 deaths. That means 710 Victorians have now lost their lives to the virus. Daniel Andrews, the Victorian state premier says: The rolling average 28 August to 10 September Metro is 65. 3. Regional Victoria is 4.7. So, regional Victoria is poised to take at least a step and potentially two steps. We will have more to say about that next week as we get closer to that 14 day marker. This is substantially better than a few weeks ago, where the state was recording numbers in the five, six and seven hundreds each day. In the neighbouring state of New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, there have been 10 new cases recorded, six of which are in hotel quarantine and the other four are linked to known clusters. The country\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, this week held up New South Wales as the gold standard of tracking and tracing, and, so far, fears over the explosion of a cluster in the centre of the city, seem to have been unfounded. In South Korea, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 176 new cases of Covid-19 as of midnight Thursday, bringing the total number of infections to 21,919, with 350 deaths. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said the government was weighing up whether to ease or extend social distancing rules, given continued and consistent community transmission. \u201cIt would be right to lift the restrictions, considering the sacrifices the people are making, but we\u2019re as much worried if any hasty easing would lead to a re-spread of the virus and cause even greater pain for the public,\u201d Chung told a meeting. Inside Kosovo\u2019s hospitals, beds are filling up with the sick and dying as Covid-19 tears through one of Europe\u2019s poorest corners. But outside on the streets, a third of the population believe the pandemic is pure hoax, according to a recent poll that has shocked a government now trying to tackle the scourge of disbelief. Kosovo, a former Serbian province home to 1.8 million, has recently seen some of the highest Covid-19 death rates in Europe - while having one of the weakest healthcare systems. In Pristina, relatives, many from rural areas, told AFP that they took shifts waiting outside the infectious disease clinic to be close to their sick loved ones and on hand to buy medicine as the hospital reserves were almost empty. In a bid to convince the public of the real dangers at hand, the government has decided to let media into previously sealed hospital wards to film the suffering. \u201cTell those outside who don\u2019t believe what you saw here,\u201d an exhausted elderly man, recovering at the infectious disease clinic after a two-week battle with the respiratory disease, told a local TV channel. \u201cDon\u2019t joke with this. How can anyone believe a lie that the virus does not exist?\u201d he implored. Others who had once been among the unbelievers now know the dangers firsthand. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I believed it did not exist. Now, after the hell I went through, I am convinced and I am telling the whole nation,\u201d said an elderly woman, who had been treated with oxygen therapy for weeks. Coronavirus sceptics have gained a following around the world, from France to Australia and the United States, including Serbia, Brazil and South Africa. Conspiracy theory videos have notched up millions of views and continue to spread online despite efforts by social networks to shut down the disinformation. In Kosovo, the survey by Pyper poll company found that a third of the population did not believe the virus was real, while 61 percent said Covid-19 was \u201cless risky than described\u201d by authorities and media, said the company\u2019s CEO Ilir Krasniqi. The scepticism is a huge problem for the government as it tries to enforce measures in Kosovo, which had its deadliest month yet in August with nearly 300 deaths - a toll higher than all the three prior months combined. Citing the poll\u2019s \u201cintolerable\u201d findings, Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti\u2019s government has tightened curfews in hot-spot cities, ordered early closures for restaurants and bars and banned public gatherings and religious ceremonies. In mid-August, parliament also adopted a separate anti-Covid law with harsh penalties for those who violate safety measures, including a 35-euro ($41) fine for not wearing a mask outdoors and a 500-euro fine for violating isolation orders. The law\u2019s champion, parliamentary speaker Vjosa Osmani, said it also targeted virus deniers. \u201cThe damage they do to society is great and their misinformation should not be left unpunished,\u201d she said. Yet, 25-year-old Mendim Hoxha, a designer in eastern Gjilan, remains unconvinced. At the entrance to his office is a sign that says \u201cno masks needed here\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see the threat by the pandemic,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cThe deaths are not caused by the virus but by other health issues.\u201d Leonard Presheva, a 28-year-old Pristina resident, insists the virus is no more than a normal flu. \u201cIn the beginning they said keep a distance, wear masks and gloves. Now nobody cares now about distance and gloves, but they want us to wear the masks so they can block our breathing during 40-degree weather.\u201d Some say it is no surprise to see such scepticism in a society where corruption and an unstable political scene have eaten away at public trust in government for years. \u201cA considerable part of the population is filled with conspiracy theories that this is only in the interest of governments, of great powers, of certain political forces,\u201d sociologist Shemsi Krasniqi, a professor at Pristina university, said. In the first week after the penalties came into force, police issued 5000 fines for failure to wear a mask or respect distancing rules. Intensive care medics were significantly less likely to have been infected with Covid-19 than cleaners and other healthcare workers in departments deemed lower risk, according to a study of several British hospitals at the peak of the pandemic. Agence France-presse reports that the research also found that people of black, Asian and minority ethnicity were nearly twice as likely to have been infected as white colleagues. It follows several studies suggesting race, income and allocation of personal protective equipment (PPE) create biases in the burden of infections. Researchers said the results could be because those working in intensive therapy units (ITU) were prioritised for the highest level of masks and other equipment. \u201cWe presumed intensive care workers would be at highest risk ... But workers in ITU are relatively well protected compared with other areas,\u201d said lead author Alex Richter, a professor of immunology at the University of Birmingham. In the study, published in the journal Thorax, researchers tested more than 500 staff at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which runs several hospitals and employs more than 20,000 staff. All the staff were at work in late April, when cases were peaking around a month after the UK went into lockdown. At this time the trust was admitting five patients with serious Covid-19 infection every hour, but capacity to perform tests for infection was severely constrained even for healthcare workers. Researchers offered to give staff who had no symptoms two different tests \u2013 one to see if they were currently infected and the other to test for antibodies indicating that they had previously had the virus. Nearly 2.5% - 13 out of 545 - staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for Covid-19 infection. Researchers also took blood samples from 516 staff and found that 24% of them had antibodies for the virus. This compares to 6% generally in the Midlands region of England at the time. Ten out of 29 cleaners involved in the study - or 34.5% - had antibodies suggesting a previous infection. The rates were similar for clinicians working in acute medicine and general internal medicine - 33% and 30% respectively - while staff working in intensive care had the lowest rates (15%, or nine out of 61 participants). The authors said it was not clear from their observational study whether the higher rates of infection among some staff \u201carises from a greater risk of exposure to the virus, or a greater risk of infection if exposed\u201d. \u201cRegardless of the cause, this finding demands urgent further investigation, particularly in view of the ethnic disparities in the outcome from Covid-19,\u201d they said. I\u2019m just circling back on President Trump\u2019s claim at his recent Michigan rally that Joe Biden is an anti-vaxxer. \u201cJoe Biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracies,\u201d Trump said, claiming the \u201conly reason he\u2019s (Biden) doing that is he knows we are right next to having a vaccine\u201d and he doesn\u2019t want Trump to get credit for it. For the record, Biden\u2019s website says a government led by him would \u201cplan for the effective, equitable distribution of treatments and vaccines because discovering isn\u2019t enough if they get distributed like Trump\u2019s testing and PPE fiascos.\u201d It says says if Biden is elected, his presidency would invest $25bn in a \u201cvaccine manufacturing and distribution plan that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free\u201d. It adds: \u201cAs we enter the height of the political season, politics should play no role in determining the safety and efficacy of any vaccine.\u201d Seems like it\u2019s too late by some way to keep politics out of this issue. Just on Trump calling Bob Woodward a \u201cwhack job\u201d, he\u2019s clearly trying to discredit the damaging stories in the investigative journalist\u2019s new book, Rage, that details in Trump\u2019s own words how the president knew how dangerous the virus was, but publicly played it down. But it\u2019s hard to think of a better-credentialed journalist in the US than Woodward, who\u2019s best known for covering the Watergate affair and the consequent fall of an earlier scandal-ridden president, Richard Nixon. Woodward has rejected the president\u2019s suggestion that he sat on his coronavirus recordings for months, defending his decision not to publish immediately. In an interview with the Washington Post\u2019s media columnist, Margaret Sullivan, Woodward said he needed to provide more complete context than he would a news story. Woodward told Sullivan he did not know where Trump acquired his information and \u201cthe biggest problem I had, which is always a problem with Trump, is I didn\u2019t know if it was true\u201d. \u201cMy job is to understand it, and to hold him accountable, and to hold myself accountable,\u201d said Woodward, explaining that it took months to contextualise everything with reporting. Further revelations in Woodward\u2019s book tell how allies tried to rein in \u201cchildish\u201d Trump\u2019s foreign policy. As the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger reports: Four days before ordering a drone strike against the Iranian military commander Qassem Suleimani, Donald Trump was debating the assassination on his own Florida golf course, according to Bob Woodward\u2019s new book on the mercurial president. Trump\u2019s golfing partner that day was Senator Lindsey Graham, who had emerged as one of his closest advisers, and who urged him not to take such a \u201cgiant step\u201d, that could trigger \u201calmost total war\u201d. Graham warned Trump he would be raising the stakes from \u201cplaying $10 blackjack to $10,000-a-hand blackjack\u201d. Bob Woodward rejects criticism that he sat on Trump \u2018deadly\u2019 virus remarksRead more \u201cThis is over the top,\u201d the senator said. \u201cHow about hitting someone a level below Suleimani, which would be much easier for everyone to absorb?\u201d Trump\u2019s chief of staff at the time, Mick Mulvaney, also begged Graham to help change Trump\u2019s mind. Trump would not be persuaded, pointing to Iranian-orchestrated attacks on US soldiers in Iraq, which he said were masterminded by the Iranian general, the leader of the elite Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Suleimani was killed in Baghdad on 3 January, triggering a retaliatory Iranian missile strike against a US base in Iraq, but so far not the large-scale conflict Graham and others warned the president about. You can read the Julian Borger\u2019s full story below: Re Churchill\u2019s rooftop speeches (see below), I\u2019ve established that he sometimes watched air raids from rooftops in Whitehall, according to Roy Jenkins\u2019 2001 book, Churchill. Nothing about speeches however, but if anyone reading knows, please feel free to get in touch via alison.rourke@guardian.co.uk Just back to Trump\u2019s election rally, and he\u2019s just basically accused Biden of being an anti-vaxxer....saying he does not want a vaccine for political reasons. Trump\u2019s saying no person who needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. He says the US \u201chas achieved one of the lowest case-fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world\u201d. According to Johns Hopkins University, the US has a case fatality rate of 3%, which ranks it 51st globally. The US ranks 12th in the world for deaths per 100,000 population, at just under 58.34, according to Johns Hopkins. He says America will \u201cprevail over the China virus\u201d and quotes Franklin D Roosevelt, saying the only thing Americans have to fear is fear itself. Then trump steps up his attack Bob Woodward, author of the new book, Rage, which alleges Trump has said one thing privately about the dangers of the virus, and another thing publicly. He calls Woodward a \u201cwhack job\u201d. He talks of the \u201ckeep calm and carry on\u201d slogan of the British government in the second world war, saying that\u2019s what he has done. Finally he tells a story about how during the war when Hitler was bombing London, Churchill used to speak from roof tops, calling on people to be calm. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true, but I\u2019ll try to find out. France recorded almost 10,000 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, its highest ever single-day total, a day before a cabinet meeting that might consider imposing fresh, local lockdowns to curb the spread of the disease. Health authorities reported 9,843 new confirmed coronavirus cases, beating by almost 900 the previous record of 8,975, set six days earlier. Since the beginning of the month, new cases have gone up by 7,292 each day on average, a figure that blows away the previous record daily average of 3,003 seen in August. The number of patients in intensive care units stands at 615, a level unseen since the end of June. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Thursday that nothing would be ruled out at Friday\u2019s cabinet meeting, while President Emmanuel Macron said he hoped any new measures would not be too restrictive. Public trust in vaccine safety is slowly growing in Europe even as it dips in parts of Asia and Africa, AFP reports, with researchers calling for more investment in health information campaigns for the forthcoming Covid-19 vaccine. The largest ever global survey of vaccine confidence, published in the Lancet medical journal, shows clear links between political instability and misinformation and the levels of trust in the safety of medicines. The World Health Organization lists vaccine hesitancy as one of its top 10 global health threats, and dipping levels of immunisation coverage have seen outbreaks of preventable diseases such as polio and measles in recent years. The survey of nearly 300,000 respondents shows trust in vaccine safety increasing \u2013 with some exceptions \u2013 across Europe. In France, where confidence in vaccines has been consistently low for decades, it shows an increase from 22% to 30% of people strongly agreeing they are safe. In Britain, confidence in vaccine safety rose from 47% in May 2018 to 52% in November 2019. Poland and Serbia however saw significant declines in public vaccine confidence. Afghanistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan saw \u201csubstantial\u201d increases in the number of people strongly disagreeing that vaccines are safe between 2015 and 2019. In Azerbaijan, public mistrust surged from 2% to 17% in that timeframe. Authors of the research attributed this \u201cworrying trend\u201d in part to political instability and religious extremism. Heidi Larson from the London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the research, said online misinformation was also a significant problem. \u201cWhen there is a large drop in vaccination coverage, it is often because there\u2019s an unproven vaccine safety scare seeding doubt and distrust,\u201d she said. Larson said that public mistrust in politicians in general also likely played a role. As the world races to find a vaccine to potentially end the Covid-19 pandemic, the researchers warned that governments need to ramp up investment in public information campaigns and as well as distribution infrastructure. Without this, Daniel Salmon from John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said \u201cthere is a risk of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines never reaching their potential due to a continued inability to quickly and effectively respond to public vaccine safety concerns, real or otherwise\u201d. The UN has called for an immediate \u201cquantum leap\u201d in funding to fight the new coronavirus as the death toll crossed 900,000 six months after the pandemic broke out. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, urged countries to find $15bn over the next three months to fund the ACT-Accelerator programme, a global collaboration to hunt for a vaccine and treatments led by the UN\u2019s World Health Organization (WHO). \u201cEither we stand together or we will be doomed,\u201d Guterres said, calling the virus the \u201cnumber one global security threat\u201d. \u201cWe need a quantum leap in funding to increase the chances of a global solution to get the world moving, working and prospering again,\u201d he said. He said the near $3bn contributed so far had been critical but $35bn more was needed to shift from start-up to scale-up \u2013 beginning with $15bn in the next three months. He said typical aid budgets would not cover the costs, urging donors to \u201cgo deep\u201d into money set aside for combating coronavirus. President Trump has now arrived in Freeland, Michigan, where he\u2019s holding a rally at the airport. He\u2019s currently criticising Joe Biden. Many of his supporters are crowded together, shoulder to shoulder, and few with masks on. It\u2019s become a theme at Trump rallies. In Michigan there is state rule against gatherings of over 50 people. I\u2019ll bring you any virus lines from the rally as they pop up. Interestingly, Fox News has cut away from the rally to talk to studio guests, while the president is in full flight. While Donald Trump told a White House briefing on Thursday that the US was \u201crounding the final turn (on coronavirus), and a lot of good things are happening\u201d, the country\u2019s top infections diseases expert, Anthony Fauci, warned Harvard Medical School panel that the US \u201cneeded to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it\u2019s not going to be easy\u201d. Fauci warned against underestimating Covid\u2019s power to cause destruction. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t ever, ever underestimate the potential of the pandemic. And don\u2019t try and look at the rosy side of things.\u201d He also warned that some parts of the US would see rises in cases after last weekend\u2019s Labor Day holiday. The Memorial Day holiday at the end of May was also blamed for surges in June and July. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, with me, Alison Rourke. Leading US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said the country needs to \u201cHunker down and get through this fall and winter, because it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d Fauci told a panel discussion with doctors from Harvard Medical School that there was a difficult few months ahead for the country. It came as Trump claimed the US was \u201crounding the final turn\u201d in its coronavirus crisis as the country\u2019s death toll passed 190,000. The president said during a White House press conference today: \u201cWe\u2019re rounding the final turn, and a lot of good things are happening.\u201d In reality, at least 191,536 Americans have already died from the virus, representing a far higher death toll than any other country in the world. France has recorded nearly 10,000 new cases, its highest ever single-day total, a day before a cabinet meeting that might consider imposing fresh, local lockdowns to curb the spread of the disease. The United Nations has called for an immediate \u2018quantum leap\u2019 in funding for global programmes developing coronavirus treatments and vaccine candidates. A $15bn funding gap needs to be plugged over the next three months, the the UN secretary-general said. Finland\u2019s prime minister will work remotely until further notice after the country\u2019s new coronavirus tracing app warned that she may have been exposed to virus. Greece has reported 372 new cases of the coronavirus, its highest daily figure since the pandemic began, bringing its total caseload to 12,452. Another four deaths were registered, taking the toll to 297. Brazil recorded 40,557 additional confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, and 983 deaths from the disease, the health ministry said on Thursday. Tougher coronavirus restrictions are to be imposed in Portugal ahead of the start of the school year, including halving the size of permitted gatherings and new curbs on drinking. Sales of alcohol will also be barred from 8pm as will drinking in public spaces."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
