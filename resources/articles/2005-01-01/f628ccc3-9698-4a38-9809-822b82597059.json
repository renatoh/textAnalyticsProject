The League Managers' Association wants an end to the scenario that requires injured players to leave the field after treatment and a revision of the much-manipulated offside law. The association's chief executive John Barnwell expects both regulations to be discussed at next month's meeting in Cardiff of the International Football Association Board, the annual forum for law amendments. Support is being canvassed from the home associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who each have one vote each as opposed to Fifa's four. The FA will consider the LMA's proposals, which start with allowing a treated player to stay on the field if he has been injured by foul play. \"The rule is stupid,\" said Barnwell. \"If a player has been injured by a foul it can't be right for the opposition to gain an advantage. Players shouldn't have to leave the pitch in such circumstances.\" The LMA suggests that players should only go off when they have been injured accidentally or in the act of committing a foul. The offside issue is even more complex following the recent change that regards players as \"inactive\" unless they are in direct receipt of the ball or in close proximity to a scoring attempt. \"The law is a joke at the moment,\" said Barnwell. He believes the trend for players' to linger in an offside position before jogging back to break away from the last defender is an abuse of the new interpretation. The LMA is also seeking an explanation of what constitutes an obvious goal-scoring opportunity following inconsistencies in the use of red cards for professional fouls and they are advocating a total ban on shirt removal. This would include a player lifting his shirt over his head as in the case of Everton's Tim Cahill, whose dismissal for a second caution exposed the ambiguity of the rule."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
