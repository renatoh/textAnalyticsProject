The Birmingham manager has responded to Hleb's comments by reminding the midfielder that Arsenal were vanquished in the Carling Cup final and pointing out that the Midlands club are more than capable of passing the ball. Hleb has failed to live up to expectations during an injury-disrupted campaign in which he has made 11 Premier League starts and shown only glimpses of the form that earned him a move to Barcelona from Arsenal three years ago. After his first appearance for Birmingham in almost two months, against Sunderland on Saturday, Hleb said: \"Here you just need to fight, run, not too much passing. This, for me, is something new. This is a different experience and I prefer to play, to enjoy football.\" McLeish, who is hoping to pull off an unlikely double over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night following Birmingham's 1-0 win at St Andrew's in November, chose his words carefully in response. \"Alex is a terrific player, we haven't seen the best of him but I'd like to think he has learned a bit about other aspects of the game while he has been [here],\" he said. \"The only other thing I'd say about Alex is it shows we can still beat a team like Arsenal in a major cup final when perhaps we are not the best footballing team in the world. Not many are like Arsenal and Barcelona but it shows a team with other qualities can do that [win]. We can still pass the ball and we have done it well but we have adhered to some tactics that have served us well and we play to our strengths. We can play football. Look at guys like [Barry] Ferguson. They take care of the ball.\" McLeish appeared unperturbed by Hleb's desire to find a new club \u2013 the 29-year-old hopes to remain in the Premier League rather than return to Barcelona \u2013 at the end of the season. \"If Alex can make a contribution in the next six games, we will take it,\" he said. \"If he wants to go in the summer, we will shake his hand and wish him well.\" Hleb is likely to feature at some stage against a Chelsea side that McLeish believes will soon benefit from Fernando Torres's presence. \"It is only a matter of time before Torres starts scoring again. He is too good a player,\" he said. \"Some day he is going to score. If you start to worry about things like that, it just distracts you.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
