Nor do judges, the BBC, liberals, academics, doctors, scientists and optimists. Some footballers and musicians and writers used to know about real life, but don't any more. Because life can only be real if it's nasty and brutish, though not necessarily short. Having a nice time, being cheerful and comfortable, can't possibly be right. It's a false image, based on faulty knowledge \u2013 you've probably forgotten something really important, left the iron on, perhaps, and so your house will burn down and you'll lose all your possessions and end up living on the street. Thank goodness, because then you'll understand real life, in all its unremitting tragedy. I do hope I'm not the only one who sees something wrong in that picture. \"You know nothing about real life\", or \"You don't understand the real world\", are extraordinary accusations when you look closely at them. Brought to us, presumably, from the people who brought us \"liberal\" as a pejorative term. It can be an economic diss: rich people don't understand the lives of poor people. Of course, that can be true. But often it's used as an argument against the belief that we live in a fundamentally positive universe, or the notion that human beings are, by nature, good. At least it does in conversations I have. And I'm no Pollyanna \u2013 I can be as grumpy as the next man, as long as the next man's not Christopher Hitchens. I can be pessimistic and misanthropic, often on the Guardian's own website, but the point is that I never get shouted down on those occasions nearly as volubly as I do when I'm being sunny and optimistic. At the risk of being called unworldly, isn't that the wrong way round? Shouldn't we be promoting happiness as a norm, rather than an aberration? You see, the implication in the term \"real life\" is that it's life as it's cosmically or evolutionarily meant to be, and when that's used to describe only lives of poverty and pain, it legitimises them as somehow reasonable and only to be expected. That's not right! Knife crime isn't more \"real\" than cocktail parties, it's just more dangerous and grim. When the crappier bits of life are considered more real than the joyful bits, everyone is cheated. Happy people's happiness gets undermined and, tragically, sad people's sadness gets termed acceptable. Of course, life's a mixture of happy and sad \u2013 and neutral for that matter \u2013 and I'm not saying you can divide the world that simply \u2013 that would make me an idiot, which I possibly am, just not in that way. The problem is that implying to people who have tough lives that those lives are more real or natural than those of people with an easier time is a tacit way of opting out of helping. \"You may be struggling to make ends meet, getting punched by your partner and having racist abuse screamed at you, but at least your life's real.\" It's not a massive leap forward from, \"You'll get your reward in heaven\". I could just accept that I don't live in the real world, and enjoy that. After all, I've watched EastEnders and if that's real life, you can keep it, it looks awful. Cloud cuckoo land, where politicians live, sounds loads more fun. If I'm going to accept that I don't live in the real world, I wonder if I get to choose which world I live in. I'm too old for Narnia, too tall for The Shire and Wonderland's far too trippy. I tried Second Life briefly, but that was too geeky a life, even for me. So it looks like I'm stuck with the world I'm in, that's real to me, with all it's hope and sadness, devastating bits and triumphs, and just bobbling along sort of middling days. And if, as I'm told, it's not proper real life, I'll have to come up with a name. Not Real Life, or Simon, or the Subjective Smorgasbord. Here's a suggestion. Why don't we use as our starting point the notion that people are generally a good thing, noble and willing to improve themselves and their communities, and find ways to help everyone do that. Make that our fundamental understanding of real life, rather than the idea that other human beings are generally horrid and would steal your telly as soon as look at you, and that's just how it is. Enough of this writing, and back to my real life. I'm off to see Star Trek."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
