Speaking at a press conference after his acquittal on a rape charge, Mr Zuma said he hoped that his trial would not be a setback for the campaigns against Aids and rape. \"I erred in having unprotected sex,\" he said. \"I should have known better and should have acted more cautiously. \"I unconditionally apologise to all the people of our nation and I pledge to continue supporting the struggle against HIV and Aids and the struggle against gender-based violence.\" Mr Zuma, 64, said his supporters were wrong to vilify the 31-year-old who accused him of rape. He said he harboured no ill will towards her and extended a \"hand of friendship\" to the anti-rape activists who demonstrated during the trial. The judge ruled that Mr Zuma and his accuser had sex by mutual consent. \"I am back as deputy president of the ANCa\" Mr Zuma said. He faces a separate trial in July for corruption. Although he faces an uphill battle in reviving his political career, he said if he were nominated by the ANC to run for president in 2009 he could not refuse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
