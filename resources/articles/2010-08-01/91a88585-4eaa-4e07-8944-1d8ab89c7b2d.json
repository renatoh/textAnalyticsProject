They are getting the call this week that they need not bother coming in to start on 20 September, thanks to the government's decision to close the commission down. One says: \"A lot of us had waited since April to start ... a lot had rejected other offers, left their current jobs and also moved to locations nearer to their area of work. Also not to forget that everyone thought they had jobs secured and stopped applying, which means the 2010 graduate intake for most employers is now closed. This has had a huge impact on me and many graduates who thought they were going to be starting work in just over four weeks. Oh, and we worked extremely hard to get on to this scheme.\" The commission says it is telephoning each recruit individually and will try to direct them to other jobs. Don't suppose Eric Pickles, safe in his new ministerial Jag, will mind too much though. Tough, isn't it? \u2712As if that weren't enough iniquity, sniggers are resounding in the NHS at health secretary Andrew Lansley's deployment of that useful jargon \"a paradigm shift\" in announcing his plans for the service. Ah, paradigm, it is said, a buzzword deployed by dumb people wishing to sound important. According to no less an authority than Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, \"Paradigm is a word too often used by those who would like to have a new idea but cannot think of one\". Clearly, he couldn't have been thinking of the new minister though, could he? \u2712Tony Blair doesn't have many friends these days, but his fellow author and former colleague Chris Mullin has come to his support in a letter to the Daily Telegraph following that newspaper's uncharitable interpretation of the former prime minister's donation of his book proceeds to the British Legion, which appeared under the headline: \"Questions over Blair donation to British Legion\", and queried how much he would actually be giving. Mullin writes: \"A magnificent piece of British journalism. Quite a challenge to make a charitable donation of this size \u2013 and to a cause of which most Telegraph readers thoroughly approve \u2013 sound sleazy, but you have risen magnificently to the occasion.\" Thought we'd just share that, as Mullin does not expect it to appear in the Telegraph. As indeed, at least until last night, it hadn't. \u2712These wicked liberals, they get everywhere, don't they? A US conservative pressure group is making the accusation against that unlikeliest of institutions, Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Such a failing is particularly heinous because it's the very institution chosen by George Bush for his presidential library, and used to have Dick Cheney as a trustee. Campus Reform deduces that SMU must be dangerously subversive, though, because liberal student groups outnumber conservative ones by five to one, and 84% of the school's staff who donated during the 2008 presidential election gave to Democrats. Even worse, freshmen are required to read Barack Obama's Dreams From My Father, which amounts to indoctrination, says the group's Tony Listi. He insists they must \"make greater effort to achieve ... real intellectual diversity on campus to make sure that the conservative point of view is not stifled and that SMU is not purely an institution of liberal indoctrination\". Yeah, right. \u2712And finally, the Local Government Association has compiled a list of infallibly silly calls recorded by its members in the last year. They include a request phoned in from South Korea to East Dorset by a resident asking the council to order him a Christmas turkey and another to Sutton council, asking where the caller could find an old bath he could fill with custard. If local authorities didn't meet such needs, who would?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
