At times there was more action from the stands than on the pitch as the supporters voiced their hatred of one another throughout an energetic and lively 90 minutes of this fifth-round tie at Turf Moor that will now see a replay at Ewood Park on March 1. At various stages two fans ran on to the pitch, one confronting Robbie Savage in the closing five minutes of injury time, a break-dancing streaker, while there was also a coin thrown at Burnley winger Jean-Louis Valois. After the violence that erupted the last time these sides met at Turf Moor just over four years ago, recent meetings between senior police officials had ensured nothing was left to chance. A 600-strong contingent were on duty inside and outside the ground, including mounted patrols and dog handlers, while a police helicopter was constantly in evidence for long periods either side of the game. Such a high-profile police presence was understandable given the vitriol directed from the two sets of supporters towards one another, with the east Lancashire air dominated by abusive chanting. When referee Mike Dean's whistle sounded to start the game, the first few touches from the Rovers players were greeted with a chorus of boos, underlining the warnings manager Mark Hughes had given his players about the atmosphere. When the first robust challenge went in from Morten-Gamst Pedersen on Michael Duff in the opening minute, that resulted in the Norwegian being on the receiving end of fierce jeers. As per usual on occasions such as these, the hype and expectation exceeded the actual action, and as is customary with the supporters baiting each other rather than getting behind their team, it was left to the players to divert attention back towards the game. Sadly, the first chance did not materialise until the 16th minute of a half that was competitive and combative, but lacking in entertainment and chances. From a Savage free-kick from deep, Pedersen rose highest in the heart of the Clarets area to glance a header narrowly over the bar. Burnley responded two minutes later when Tony Grant teed up a corner for Micah Hyde to drive in a shot from 20 yards that was blocked by captain Andy Todd. The rebound fell to Peter Whittingham, on loan from Aston Villa, and although his shot from the edge of the area was on target, John McGreal intercepted with an attempted back-heel he flicked wide. That was as close as Burnley came in the opening 45 minutes for although they stifled their Premiership opponents, they lacked creativity and it was Rovers who had the better chances. Pedersen's 25-yard free-kick, after Hyde had received the first booking of the game for a foul on Brett Emerton, brought off a superb save from Brian Jensen, who also collected a curler from Paul Dickov at the second time of asking. Sadly, the half was also notable for an object being thrown at Valois as he lined up to take a corner, with Dean passing it on to fourth official Chris Foy. In light of what unfolded during last night's tie between Everton and Manchester United with goalkeeper Roy Carroll being struck by a coin, it was yet another case of the game being brought into disrepute. Mercifully, at least the fire in the stands was replaced by a fire in the belly of the players for the second half as there was a greater degree of urgency among both sides. After Todd had seen his interception to a teasing Valois cross just clear the crossbar, Blackburn appealed for a penalty soon after, with Dickov fouled by Mo Camara. But Dean pointed to a spot an inch outside the area from where Pedersen whipped in another curling free kick that was punched clear by Jensen. After a male streaker had brought a light-hearted moment to proceedings, and with the home side enjoying their best period of the game, Rovers conjured the best opportunity. Pedersen flicked on Brad Friedel's long kick into the path of Dickov to leave the Scotland international with just Jensen to beat. But he flicked his shot a yard wide, perhaps with one eye on the advancing John McGreal as both players required treatment after a nasty collision, which ultimately led to their withdrawal over the following 10 minutes. Friedel then made his one and only save six minutes from time as he scooped up an acutely-angle shot from Camara before a Burnley fan brought an unsavoury end to the tie in the dying stages when he chose to square up to Savage. He was eventually brought down by police, but questions will be asked as to how he made his way on to the pitch in the first place given the stewarding on patrol."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
