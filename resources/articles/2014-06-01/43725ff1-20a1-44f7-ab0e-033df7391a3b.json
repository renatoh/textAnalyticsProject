Action on Sugar, set up earlier this year to reduce the amount of sugar added to food and soft drinks, found that 79% of the sugary drinks included in its survey of 232 sugar-sweetened drinks from leading supermarkets contained six or more teaspoons of sugar per 330ml can. Health editor, Sarah Boseley writes today: Traditional and up-market fizzy drinks such as ginger beer and cloudy lemonade contain more sugar than Coca Cola and Pepsi, according to a new analysis. The worst offenders are ginger beers, such as Old Jamaica ginger beer and Jammin sparkling ginger beer flavour drink, which have the equivalent of 13 teaspoons of sugar per 330ml serving. Waitrose, Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury\u2019s ginger beers have 11. Coca Cola and Pepsi have nine The World Health Organisation (WHO) set a guideline limit, in 2002, that sugar should make up less than 10% of total energy intake per day, with a recommendation that countries should aim to get it down as low as 5%. It is estimated that 5% of total energy intake is equivalent to 25g of sugar per day, according to Action on Sugar. Seven of the top ten drinks with the highest amount of sugar are ginger beer flavoured beverages. Old Jamaica ginger beer, which tops the list has 52g of sugar per 330ml serving (15.7g of sugar per 100g) - the equivalent of 13 teaspoons of sugar. In comparison, Coca Cola and Pepsi have the equivalent of nine teaspoons of sugar per 330ml serving. Club Orange and Sainsbury's cloudy lemonade also make the top ten list of soft drinks, surveyed by Action on Sugar, containing the highest amount of sugar. Club Orange contains 14.3g of sugar per 100ml or the equivalent of 12 teaspoons of sugar per 330ml serving, while Sainsbury's cloudy lemonade packs in 11 teaspoons of sugar per 330ml. The survey also found that some elderflower sparkling drinks contain more sugar than Coca-Cola. For example, Tesco's Finest grape &amp; elderflower spritz has 11.3g of sugar per 100 ml (37g of sugar per 330ml), while Coca-Cola and Pepsi were found to each have 10.6g of sugar per 100ml (35g of sugar per 330ml). It has also just been announced that Coca Cola will be launching a new version of its best selling drink with a third less sugar and a third fewer calories, but campaigners warn that it will still contain the equivalent of four teaspoons. Kawther Hashem, nutritionist at Action on Sugar says: People are drinking spoonfuls of sugar in their fizzy drinks, even seemingly healthier options such as elderflower can be loaded with sugar. Look on the label for \u2018sugar per 100g\u2019 and switch to a lower or no added sugar variety of your favourite drink, or even better, don\u2019t drink them, they contain nothing of any nutritional value How was the soft drink survey conducted? The survey looked at the sugar per 100g and per portion of 232 carbonated soft drink products from nine supermarkets: Aldi, Asda, Lidl, The Co-operative, Morrisons, M&amp;S, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Waitrose. It included supermarket own and branded products Where possible, data was collected in store or online via the supermarkets website Serving size was standardised to 330ml, regular can size. Although many varieties are available in a 330ml can size, some bottles provide 250ml as a serving size and were recalculated by Action on Sugar as 330ml The survey was carried out between the 1-30 May 2014 and products were checked week commencing 2 June 2014 The table below shows all the drinks included in the soft drink survey 2014 conducted by Action on Sugar.
