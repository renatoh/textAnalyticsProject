By the time you read this the tabloids will either be whipping the nation into a frenzy, convinced that we'll win the thing, or their picture desks will be busy morphing Sven-Goran Eriksson's head into a Swede. Either way, behind the scenes there's some nifty technology underpinning the tournament. For the first time, both T-Mobile - which has the mobile rights to the championships - and the Uefa.com team will be editing and configuring coverage during matches. It will be interesting to see, with increased broadband penetration, how far we have moved on from the 2002 World Cup, when Yahoo!'s online coverage was the victim of technical gremlins. \u00b7 A big week in online music. Later today OD2, the white label download service co-founded by Peter Gabriel that had the UK market sewn up until the big guns arrived from the US, will announce a revamp, expected to include a significant boost to the number of tracks on offer. Then tomorrow Apple is expected to reveal that iTunes Europe is launching in the UK, allowing frustrated iPod owners - who can't use the other legal services - to breathe a huge sigh of relief. But Diary can't help thinking that iTunes will find it far harder to conquer the European market, without compatibility with non-iPod players and lacking the first-mover advantage that served it so well in the US. Meanwhile, MSN is thought to be close to ending the long and winding saga of the Beatles online catalogue, with Ringo and Macca close to signing a deal that will finally allow Beatles fans to download the band's songs. \u00b7 Michael Jackson has been using his toe-curling website to defend himself against charges of child abuse in the United States. As you might imagine, onsite advertising is fairly thin, but you can count on lawyers to spot a good deal - the only advertisers on the site are the Online Legal Review and the Attorney Marketing Network. \u00b7 As spring turns to summer, still no sign of the release, from the Department of Culture Media and Sport, of the government-commissioned report into the BBC's online activities. Philip Graf, appointed to lead the review last August, delivered his verdict to the DCMS weeks ago so goodness knows what they are doing. Whitehall insiders suggest that it will see the light of day \"in the next few weeks\". \u00b7 Interesting to note that while the Sun was brave enough to show Beckham rearranging his goldenballs on its front page last week, incurring the wrath of the player and the FA, it was strangely coy about putting the paparazzi pic online. Instead, the \"story\" was accompanied by an entirely non-controversial shot of Becks looking neat and tidy on the pitch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
