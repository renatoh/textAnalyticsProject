But the makers of the hit Sunday night remake have declared themselves \u201cpretty innocent\u201d over the much-discussed shirtless scenes which seem finally to have toppled Colin Firth\u2019s turn as Mr Darcy as television\u2019s most talked about romantic lead. His role as the smouldering Ross Poldark has catapulted Turner to fame but the star, who previously appeared in Peter Jackson\u2019s film trilogy The Hobbit, said he steered clear of the occasionally feverish viewer response. The drama\u2019s executive producer, Damien Timmer, told the new issue of Radio Times: \u201cYes, yes, the shirtlessness! But honestly, we were pretty innocent about the shirt-taking-off stuff. \u201cNo, really. Ross does it in the book, he goes swimming, he washes himself clean. And he\u2019s a farmer, and it\u2019s very hot in Cornwall! Besides, we didn\u2019t audition him with his clothes off.\u201d Turner said: \u201cIt was quite odd to walk into a newsagent and see myself holding a scythe with a peculiar smile on my face. \u201cI don\u2019t feed it, you know. I think I could easily get addicted to Googling myself if I did start doing it, so I just stay out of that entirely. It\u2019s better not to know, sometimes. I don\u2019t read any press. I make it a thing.\u201d The drama, which co-stars Eleanor Tomlinson as Poldark\u2019s maid, later wife, Demelza, comes to an end on BBC1 on Sunday, having already been recommissioned for a second series after averaging about 8 million viewers. The series has been credited with boosting the tourism trade in Cornwall, where it is set and filmed, as well as \u2013 more surprisingly \u2013 a spike in interest in scything. Debbie Horsfield, who adapted Winston Graham\u2019s Poldark novels, said she wanted to cast Turner from the start, saying he had \u201ccertain traits, that kind of rebel/outsider element, the damaged person who\u2019s at odds with the whole world\u201d. Timmer said Turner \u201chas that integrity in the way he plays Ross, he commits to it so completely; he is Ross in all of his complex brooding\u201d. Turner said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re on TV, you might get stopped in the street the odd time, but I suppose it\u2019s how you handle it yourself. If you want your life to change, it can change, but if you don\u2019t want it to change, there are ways you can hold on to all of those things that matter.\u201d He said of living in Dublin: \u201cIt\u2019s fairly calm and relaxed. There\u2019s no mania \u2013 not that I can see.\u201d The drama was originally made for TV in the 1970s when it attracted audiences of 15 million and the remake has helped BBC1 to its highest share of an audience in a decade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
