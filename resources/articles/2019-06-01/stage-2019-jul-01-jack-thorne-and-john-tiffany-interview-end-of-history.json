Sounds harsh, but it wasn\u2019t so much a literary judgment as a private one. The End of History, his bruising family drama, is \u201cthe most personal thing I\u2019ve ever written\u201d, Thorne admits. No wonder he looks tense during the rehearsal lunch break. He and his frequent collaborator, the director John Tiffany, sit in school-style plastic chairs, and Thorne \u2013 too tall for usual purposes \u2013 is awkwardly folded up, feet on the seat, in an orthopaedic nightmare. By contrast, Tiffany brings the jolly \u2013 tucking into lunch, lobbing in jokes. The air between them is all warmth and care. Thorne speaks like someone who fears he\u2019ll never work again. You should check out your CV, I joke \u2013 it\u2019s really impressive. It gleams with hits in TV (Skins, The Virtues), theatre (Let the Right One In) and the Potterverse (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child). But he always frets that he\u2019s starting from scratch, while feeling the reproachful burden of past success. We plunge into The End of History. A grand title wrongfoots you into an acutely intimate play. It was, Thorne discloses, originally called The Healthy and the Strong (a quote from the text), but \u201cit didn\u2019t feel like it quite fitted\u201d. A title needs to \u201czoom out\u201d, Tiffany explains. \u201cI always see things in terms of those series of photos that start off at a cellular level and zoom out to the Milky Way.\u201d Francis Fukuyama, the political theorist who coined the title phrase in 1989, has since edged back from the idea that, with the cold war over, western liberalism had triumphed and ideological struggles were done with. The play begins in 1997, \u201cthe moment before populism completely took over \u2026 when people believed in things as opposed to what would get them votes,\u201d as Tiffany describes it. The play centres on a left-leaning family. Lesley Sharp and David Morrissey play Sal and David, who after a lifetime devoted to equality and principled dissent imagine that their own ideological battles are over, that their work is done \u2013 at least when it comes to passing those values on to their kids. But three compulsive acts, set at 10-year intervals, ask what happens to conviction, how belief shapes a family. For a guarded man, Thorne can tread boldly. \u201cSal and David are pretty tight versions of Maggie and Mike, my mum and dad,\u201d he declares. Tiffany gasps: \u201cI wondered if you were going to say that so explicitly!\u201d Although awesome role models, Sal and David seem daunting parents. They radiate commitment, with great gusts of passion, humour and no-filter opinion. \u201cMy mum and dad really are those people \u2013 they are amazing and brilliant. They are tricky parents. I want to shake them sometimes. But I love them very much, and this is a love note.\u201d Thorne, who grew up in Bristol, began work on this play almost immediately after becoming a father. He ruefully quotes a line about suspecting that \u201cyou\u2019re shitter than your parents at being a parent\u201d. Can he ever transmit as clean a set of values as they did? \u201cI am a lot more compromised as a person than either of them. I\u2019ve made a lot of decisions about my work and life that aren\u2019t as pure.\u201d The play begins in 1997, Thorne\u2019s own coming of age: \u201cMy first vote was for Tony Blair.\u201d As New Labour\u2019s shiny liberal democracy has receded into history, Thorne says: \u201cI look at my peers and don\u2019t see the same need and passion to set the world right, being prepared to stand in the cold to protest, to do the hard miles that I see still in my parents\u2019 generation.\u201d Do the play\u2019s dogged conversations over burnt cheese on toast reflect life with the Thornes? \u201cYes, though my mum was a better cook,\u201d Thorne says, \u201cand she talked about anal sex slightly less.\u201d He knows his parents will not pretend to like the play \u2013 they never do. \u201cYou haven\u2019t written it for them to like, though, have you?\u201d Tiffany reminds him. \u201cMy little sister went; they\u2019ll be cool with it, they\u2019ll like it.\u201d He describes his sister \u2013 a former political adviser who is retraining as a maths teacher \u2013 as \u201cthe true child of my parents, so her reading was very important. She is pure of heart, my sister.\u201d Even the Thornes feel the strain of these trying political times. \u201cFor the first time we haven\u2019t discussed how we all voted in the European elections. I think we\u2019re all exhausted by it.\u201d Despite a final act set in 2017, \u201cthe B-word is mentioned only once. Brexit is a symptom of a country that\u2019s got itself into a malaise and this play is about that malaise.\u201d How do Thorne\u2019s parents feel about his work? He scrunches up. \u201cI think they are proud of bits of it \u2013 and then there are other bits where they would question it. They saw a film I wrote and went, \u2018What happened?\u2019 [in terms of his involvement]. I quite like that they\u2019re so honest.\u201d But honesty is hard. \u201cI feel the judgment constantly. Growing up in judgment is really tough. That idea of \u2018What are you doing for the world today?\u2019 is something that still haunts me.\u201d Thorne and Tiffany first met more than 20 years ago, and have since collaborated on wizards and vampires \u2013 but Thorne submitted this script to the Royal Court rather than direct to Tiffany. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put our friendship under that test. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to cope with the rejection.\u201d If he couldn\u2019t work on it, Tiffany interrupts, there would be pragmatic reasons. \u201cI know,\u201d Thorne answers, nine times in rapid succession. \u201cBut this one\u2019s very personal to me \u2013 so the fact that it\u2019s being directed by him is really important to me.\u201d Tiffany\u2019s productions (Black Watch, The Glass Menagerie) are notably dynamic, and here, too, he drafted in Steven Hoggett, his long-term movement collaborator. \u201cAll the frou-frou \u2013 we always call it frou-frou \u2013 goes into the decade jumps. There isn\u2019t one moment where all the characters sit round the table \u2013 the second it\u2019s about to happen, someone moves.\u201d Their last Royal Court collaboration was Hope \u2013 but wasn\u2019t there some little project after that? Oh yes, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, still storming London and Broadway. Thorne\u2019s rollicking text, astonishingly for a play script, teleported to the top of the bestseller charts. So, did the show change their lives? Tiffany considers. \u201cIt marked the climax of something we\u2019d been working towards as a group of people for 20-odd years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe amount of people that see it is gorgeous, and of course it gives a bit of freedom, financially. And creatively, just because it worked.\u201d In retrospect, that success seems inevitable \u2013 but Tiffany recalls widespread public doubts that it could satisfy fervid fan expectation. \u201cI never allowed us to think about it.\u201d That, Thorne explains, is the director\u2019s characteristic response. \u201cI would have let it overwhelm me. But we were all on the John train and the John train was just going.\u201d Is the John train always positive? \u201cAlways,\u201d Thorne says several times. He laughs, then asks: \u201cWhen have I ever been the positive force in our relationship? You\u2019re the warrior and I\u2019m the worrier.\u201d Meanwhile, back to this play, and its two most crucial audience members. \u201cI\u2019m very nervous about what my parents will think,\u201d Thorne says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t read it, but they know it\u2019s about them \u2013 they\u2019re coming with all their mates. I feel their impending arrival now.\u201d I dread to think what this will do to him. \u201cI\u2019m literally not in the country! So that\u2019s good.\u201d The End of History is at the Royal Court, London, until 10 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
