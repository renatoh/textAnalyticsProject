Carli Lloyd had been in such good form recently as the Women\u2019s World Cup approaches, scoring five goals in her previous three games, that the reporter had to ask: what\u2019s changed? But Lloyd disagreed with the premise of the question. \u201cI\u2019ve been in form for the last couple of years,\u201d she answered flatly. \u201cI\u2019m banging in more goals now \u2013 you start to peak as you get closer and there\u2019s a certain strategy that goes into my training. I wasn\u2019t just a bad soccer player two or three years ago and turned into a great one overnight. I\u2019ve been in form.\u201d Lloyd has been here before. \u201cHere\u201d meaning the Women\u2019s World Cup \u2013 she is about to compete in her fourth. \u201cHere\u201d meaning people misunderstanding her, whether it\u2019s the media or her own coaches. Here is where Lloyd thrives. For casual observers of the US women\u2019s national team, the enduring image of Lloyd is as the hero of the 2015 World Cup final when she scored a hat-trick \u2013 including one from an audacious half-field punt \u2013 and led the Americans to the trophy. But these days, Lloyd references the 2012 Olympics more often. That was the tournament in which Lloyd lost her starting spot because coach Pia Sundhage felt Lloyd took too many risks and gave up the ball too often. The parallels going into 2019 are obvious \u2013 again, Lloyd has lost her starting spot. This time, it\u2019s not because she\u2019s not good enough, but because she\u2019s almost 37 and coach Jill Ellis has emphasized a frenetic, non-stop attacking style better suited to other players. Just as in 2012, Lloyd is unhappy with her new role. \u201cI\u2019m not here to be a super sub, plain and simple,\u201d she told reporters in New York City last month. \u201cThat\u2019s not the type of person I am. I\u2019m a fighter \u2013 I\u2019ll fight to the end. I know my age isn\u2019t a factor. My ability isn\u2019t a factor. I feel the fittest I\u2019ve ever felt, the sharpest I\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d Lloyd was calm but there was a tinge of anger in her voice. She can\u2019t play a game for the USWNT without reporters inevitably asking her how she has adjusted to being a substitute, with her response being that she hasn\u2019t adjusted. In April, when she only played five minutes against Australia and didn\u2019t score, she went behind the sponsor boards in the mixed zone to avoid reporters. But that\u2019s probably what Ellis is glad to see. After all, if that Olympics seven years ago \u2013 the tournament that Lloyd keeps bringing up \u2013 is any guide the midfielder-turned-striker will find a way to take this World Cup by the scruff of its neck somehow, someway. Sixteen minutes into USA\u2019s 2012 Olympics campaign, Shannon Boxx went down with injury and Lloyd was thrust into the role she had been told she wasn\u2019t good enough to play. Lloyd scored the game-winner in that opening game against France, and when the US landed in the gold-medal match, she scored the game-winner again. Even at the 2015 World Cup, in a performance that later helped her become Fifa World Player of the Year, Lloyd started the tournament drawing criticism from fans and pundits alike. The US looked sluggish and sloppy, and Lloyd was ineffective. But finally, after some serendipitous yellow cards, Lloyd took over and she eventually led the USWNT to a thrilling World Cup victory. Lloyd played angry \u2013 she played to prove everyone \u2013 her coaches, fans and reports \u2013 wrong. Now, she\u2019s doing it again, and her teammates appreciate every bit of it. \u201cShe\u2019s angry. She wants to be out there, and she trains like she wants to be out there,\u201d said fellow US veteran Becky Sauerbrunn. \u201cAnd when she comes in, you see her \u2013 she\u2019s scoring, she\u2019s getting assists, she\u2019s creating opportunities. She\u2019s doing everything she possibly can to show she deserves to be on the field.\u201d Sauerbrunn is also confident Lloyd will be a threat from the bench. \u201cWe know if we\u2019re needing a goal, she\u2019s going to work very hard, she\u2019s going to get an opportunity on goal and she\u2019s probably going to score it. I\u2019m proud of her and the way she\u2019s handled it. I think she\u2019s just a star and when you put stars on a big stage like that, amazing things are going to happen.\u201d That could make the difference in France, when the US start their World Cup journey on 11 June against Thailand. Lloyd is known for stepping up in big moments. She is the only woman to score in three finals of a World Cup or an Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2015) \u2013 and she scored the game-winner in all three. And she has remained productive, even as her minutes have diminished. By the time 2016 ended, Lloyd had started 176 games in 202 appearances for the US. Since the calendar flipped to 2017, she has been a substitute in 28 of 42 matches. And yet she has held steady, notching a goal or an assist every 88 minutes, according to TruMedia analyst Paul Carr. That is nearly the same level of production as Alex Morgan, the team\u2019s designated starter in Lloyd\u2019s striker spot. She is ready for the World Cup, but Lloyd\u2019s exact role in France is still unclear. Ellis has been upfront in that she views Lloyd as a substitute and that doesn\u2019t figure to change. The Americans now play in a 4-3-3 that looks different than the team\u2019s system in years past, which essentially eliminated the midfield role Lloyd used to play. That is why Lloyd is now a striker, unburdened by defensive responsibilities, but she doesn\u2019t offer the same mobility or speed of someone like Morgan. Lloyd insists, however, that she has reinvented her game as she has grown older. No longer is she the athletic battering ram she was in her youth, recklessly going at goal. Now, she says, she is making smarter runs and is a better finisher. In other words: doubt Lloyd at your own peril \u2013 you\u2019ll only make her angry. With Lloyd admitting this may very well be her last World Cup, she\u2019s happy to prove herself one last time. \u201cThe bigger the pressure, the more it becomes instinct for me \u2013 the more I go up three levels,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cI know what\u2019s at stake. I know this could be a storybook ending. The pen is in my hand ultimately and I know the story\u2019s not over. It\u2019s going to be up to me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
