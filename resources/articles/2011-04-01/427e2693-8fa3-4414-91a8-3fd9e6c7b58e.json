Brian Dodgeon, a research fellow at the University of London's Institute of Education, is believed to have been held over the death of Isobel Clara Reilly, 15, of Acton, west London. Officers were alerted by London Ambulance Service at 4.10am on Saturday after she fell ill at a house in Barlby Road in north Kensington. Isobel was taken to hospital, but died later that morning. A 60-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs and child abandonment, the Metropolitan police said. He was bailed to return at a date in June. According to reports, there were ecstasy and other drugs, believed to be ketamine and LSD, found at the party. Isobel's death is currently being treated as unexplained, but officers are examining whether drugs played a role in her death. \"We await the results of the postmortem examination,\" a police spokesman said. A 14-year-old girl, believed to be Dodgeon's daughter, and two boys, both aged 14, were also taken to hospital as a precaution. They remained there under observation on Sunday night. Detective Sergeant Neil Philpott appealed for more information from guests who attended the party. \"We believe the victim was taken ill during a party at the address in Barlby Road,\" he said. \"We are yet to make contact with all those who attended and would ask anyone who was present at any point during the evening to make contact with officers.\" Since 1994 Dodgeon is believed to have worked part-time while pursuing a career as a teacher of alternative therapy. Isobel's family said they and their daughter's friends were \"devastated and heartbroken\" about her death. \"We hope that if anything positive comes from this dreadful event, it is that others will make the right decisions to be safe and well in the future,\" they said in a statement. They appealed for privacy, and also for anyone who had any information concerning Isobel to contact the police. Tony Ryan, headteacher of Chiswick Community School, where the teenager attended, described her as an extremely popular girl. \"Her tragically early death is devastating news to everyone associated with the school and all our thoughts are with her family at this time,\" he said. More than 200 teenagers are expected to attend a memorial for Isobel today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
