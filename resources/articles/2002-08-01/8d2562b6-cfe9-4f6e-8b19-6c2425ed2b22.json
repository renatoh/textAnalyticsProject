Whether the city he was familiar with would fascinate today's thrill-hungry, shopaholic tourists is debatable. Oxford Street circa 1770 was little more than a drover's road along which cattle from the farms around the hamlets of Kensington, Knightsbridge and Chelsea plodded on their way to Smithfield market. But anyone curious to know the origins of the adage will be enthralled by the meticulously researched Dr Johnson's London. It is packed with the sort of period detail I relish - it was the legal duty of every citizen to pave the street up to the centre-line in front of his house; gentlemen held their hats with the lining facing outwards, the exact opposite of a century earlier; and women, even high-born ladies at court, didn't wear knickers. And here's the budget for a labourer, his wife and four children living in Long Acre in 1734: \"Six pence a day for meat, four pence halfpenny for bread, three halfpenny for butter, three farthings for milk and cheese, two pence farthing for soap, candles and thread and four pence halfpenny for small ale.\" Alas, the book is abridged, but at least the sections are linked with music by Handel, 18th-century London's most celebrated composer. London: The Biography, by Peter Ackroyd, read by Simon Callow (Random House, 15hrs, \u00a339.99) This is an altogether more ambitious profile. Since it is not limited to a specific period, it can trace the rising levels of, say, urban crime or poverty using sources as far flung as the 17th-century diarist John Evelyn or the pessimistic observations of Jack London visiting the East End in 1903. \"Everything is helpless, hopeless, unrelieved and dirty. The people themselves are dirty while any attempt at cleanliness becomes a howling farce where it is not pitiful and tragic.\" The vastness of London - historically, topographically, culturally, and above all, in its international influence - is reflected in this encyclopaedic study, with Callow switching seamlessly from lisping Danny to the low-life slang of the Victorian street gangs. A must for every serious collector."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
