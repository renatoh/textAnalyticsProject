The park authority and Derbyshire county council are being encouraged by Alistair Darling, the transport secretary, to submit a funding plan involving tolls in the park's 550 square miles of hills and dales, which are now attracting 22m day visits a year. Traffic congestion has worsened in recent years following the production of several films, including this year's remake of Pride and Prejudice, set in the area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
