At some meetings, the unrelenting noise created has overshadowed the remainder of the fixture and at Newmarket's July meeting, as reported here, the volume was gently turned down as the three-day fixture went on. However, many find the opportunity to talk to Thommo and see themselves on the big screen as the highlight of their day, and at York's successful family day last Sunday for example, the crowd were eating out of his hand. One man who knows where he stands is Henry Cecil, who was interviewed by Thompson (wearing his other hat) on the At The Races TV channel on Friday. \"I don't like all that noise, you know,\" said Cecil. \"I've complained to the clerks of the course about you.\" PM's father's death a sad loss for the sport Many in racing will mourn the death last week of Ian Cameron, who enjoyed a lifelong passion for the Sport of Kings. The Prime Minister's jovial father was a familiar sight on the country's racecourses and his career as an owner spanned five decades. Cameron \u2013 who was also a successful breeder \u2013 had a share in Isle Of Skye, who won the National Hunt Handicap Chase at the 1960 Cheltenham Festival, and was also part-owner of Hello, a Group One winning juvenile for trainer John Dunlop in 1996. Indeed, Cameron was due to be represented by one of his new equine recruits 24 hours after his passing on Thursday. Understandably, the Hughie Morrison-trained Experimentalist, a two-year-old who cost \u00a323,100 as a yearling, was withdrawn out of respect to his owner ahead of his intended racecourse debut at Kempton. One of Cameron's regrets was that the Dunlop-trained Mountain Pride did not live up to hopes that he might be a Derby contender last year. Interviewed last year, Cameron hoped that his son might be present for the Classic. \"I used to take the children racing when they were young and so David has been to Epsom many times before,\" he recalled. Henry Hunt on lookout for Face of Exeter It's not quite Britain's Next Top Model, but Exeter's opening meeting of the season next month will be the unlikely setting for a competition to find the new Face Of Exeter. Upper-crust clothes manufacturer Henry Hunt is looking to find a photogenic boy and girl for use in its forthcoming catalogue and on associated Exeter literature. \"Student racegoers at Exeter fit well with our brand,\" gushes the co-founder Phoebe Garlick. \"It's all part of the lifestyle statement our clothes make, racing is the right image for us and we are very excited about our new association.\" Assistant trainer is porn free Embarrassment for one of racing's best-known right-hand men was thankfully shortlived at Doncaster this week. A young assistant trainer, staying in one of the area's best-known hotels, was collared at breakfast by staff who informed him that he had spent up to the maximum authorised amount on his card on premium TV channels. Happily, his wife stepped in to confirm that she had been with him in the room at all times and no such distractions had occurred. The mix-up was later corrected with a full apology. They seek him here, they seek him there . . . Gary Pettit is not a man you can accuse of standing still. One of the members of the False Nose 'N Glasses syndicate, who own yesterday's St Leger runner Ted Spread, Pettit attended the promotional lunch for the race in London on Monday before hot-footing it to New York for a whirlwind round of meetings as part of his role as head of the futures brokers MF Global. He then touched down back in England in time to watch his two-year-old Barwick finish second at Chester on Friday before taking a helicopter to Doncaster to see Ted Spread run. What's In A Name? Carrauntoohil seems unlikely to hit the heights of her name, which comes from the tallest peak in Ireland. Situated in the MacGillycuddy's Reeks range of County Kerry, it rises to 1,038 metres high. The name appeared to interest the commentator Simon Holt prior to the maiden at Goodwood on Tuesday, where he noted dryly before the race: \"What would we do without Google?\" Unfortunately, the Amy Weaver-ridden filly disappointed again on the track, finishing last of 13."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
