Certainly London audiences don't only turn out for showboaters - Beethoven cycles sell out, as will Pollini playing anything. The same holds, if the programming is intelligent, for contemporary music. The 1980s Stockhausen concerts at the Barbican were rammed, ditto both the recent performances of Nono's Prometeo. The usual problem is the curious decision to programme principally the second-rate, the stale, the derivative. But setting that aside, I'm bewildered by Queenan's taste. If he has \"tons of records\" by Webern - and has actually listened to them - how can he think Stockhausen's Kontra-Punkte sounded like \"a cat running up and down the piano\", given that the piece is a direct continuation of Webern's sound-world? Assuming he can manage to listen to Mahler, how can he think Berio's Sinfonia, largely a hommagio to Mahler 2, sounds like \"torture\"? If he has any sort of ears at all, how can he have failed to notice the compelling, glorious, sumptuous sound-world of Stockhausen's Trans, or the exhilaration of anything by Xenakis? If he's worried by discordance, how does he cope with most of Haydn and Beethoven being constructed out of the tensions between seemingly incompatible keys? Of course there are pups among contemporary composers - history hasn't winnowed them yet. Doubtless Adams, Ad\u00e8s and co will go the way of Raff. But there are masterpieces out there, and if people like me - with no professional musical training - can listen to them, I can't see why he can't. And if he can't, why is he reviewing them? Harry Gilonis London Joe Queenan should spread his listening net a bit wider. He failed to mention two of the most dynamic and individualistic contemporary composers: Steve Reich and Judith Weir, both of whose Barbican retrospectives in the last couple of years drew large, varied and hugely enthusiastic audiences. Both compose immensely satisfying, accessible yet challenging music which makes an immediate, tonal appeal while avoiding the saccharine superficiality of Glass, Torke etc, or the sometimes stark asceticism of Birtwistle, Carter et al. Listen to: Music for 18 Musicians; the Daniel Variations; Music for Mallet Instruments and Pieces of Wood; Vermont Counterpoint; Weir's piano concerto, Ardnamurchan Point etc. Also, Kevin Volans's White Man Sleeps, anything by Geoffrey Burgon. Or are these, too, just \"anachronisms\"? Incidentally, what does he mean, jazz is \"literally dying\"? Not only is this grammatically and philosophically suspect, it flies in the face of the evidence: Radio 3's various jazz programmes are both popular and invigorating, mixing the best of the past (Miles, Monk, Mingus etc) with exciting new stuff: Charlie Hunter, Empirical, Joe Lock etc. At the school where I teach, a group of pupils aged 14 to 18 have spontaneously formed a jazz quintet, playing the Bluenote stuff from the late 50s/early 60s - Dolphy, Horace Silver etc - with total commitment and relish. Kids, staff, parents and grandparents revel in it and the band is regularly asked to perform at school functions and teenage parties, alongside chamber musicians and rock outfits. From what I see, jazz is positively thriving, with young people at the forefront. Many people seem not to worry too much about categories and hermetically sealed compartments. It's the music, stupid. Sylvia Cooper Stroud, Gloucestershire I, for one, am not bored by new classical music. I went to see Birtwistle's Gawain twice, and I have the CDs and enjoy them as one of the most beautiful opera scores of the 20th century. I missed The Minotaur at Covent Garden, but watched it on TV, and thought it was again an extraordinarily beautiful score. Fortunately we don't all react the same way to works of art. I don't expect Joe Queenan to agree with me any more than I agree with him. Just bear in mind that Carmen was dismissed after its first performance for having no tunes.
