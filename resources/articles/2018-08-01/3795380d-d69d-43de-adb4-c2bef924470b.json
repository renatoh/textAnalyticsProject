However, in a quiet corner of the Melbourne General Cemetery, the exact opposite is true. In 1996, John Howard and the then premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett opened what is known as the Prime Ministers\u2019 Garden. At the back of the garden is a tall black wall commemorating the tenures of 29 of Australia\u2019s (now) 30 prime ministers. Even Frank Ford gets a tile for his grand total of eight days in office back in 1945. There\u2019s only one spot left and following the events of this week, it\u2019s not going to be blank for long. It\u2019s time to call the stonemason. Again. The wall forms a discrete backdrop to several actual graves. Near the entrance lie the remains of Australia\u2019s longest serving PM, Sir Robert Menzies. To the left is a memorial for Harold Holt, presumed drowned, inscribed with the words \u201cHe Loved The Sea\u201d. Beyond this are the resting places of Sir John Grey Gorton and Malcolm Fraser, who, though they didn\u2019t get along in life, are now 15m apart for the rest of time. \u201cWe have it on good authority that when Malcolm Fraser knew he\u2019d be buried here he said yes, with the tongue-in-cheek proviso that he be looking in the direction of his hero Sir Robert Menzies and not at Sir John Grey Gorton because they disliked each other,\u201d the cemetery\u2019s historian and manager of cultural heritage, Celestina Sagazio, tells Guardian Australia. While \u201ccurse\u201d may be a strong word to use, it is interesting to note that in the time since Howard opened the garden, he has been the only prime minister to serve a full term. Over the past 10 years, the wall has required more visits and updates than could possibly have been predicted. The peace of the garden is a strong contrast to the chaos of Canberra, where the turnover of leaders has become so common that when Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott back in 2015, Wikipedia pranksters updated the \u201cSport in Australia\u201d page to say: \u201cThe main national sport is the Leadership spill which fixates the nation on a random but regular basis.\u201d As the job of PM becomes more and more fleeting and impermanent, it\u2019s strange to think that alongside every leadership scuffle a chain of events is set in motion that ultimately results in someone making their way to the cemetery to physically hammer a new name or set of dates permanently into the wall. \u201cWhen Tony Abbott was defeated we had to update it. When Julia Gillard was defeated we updated. When Kevin Rudd had a second go we updated,\u201d says Sagazio. As this week\u2019s events have unfolded, it\u2019s not unlikely that the stonemasons have been waiting by their phones, the process now quite familiar. Updating the wall can\u2019t happen instantly, however. Research into the new PM needs to happen and wording needs to be proofed \u2013 the whole process will take some weeks. Meanwhile, with a federal election looming, the cemetery may need to consider starting construction of a second wall. Cemeteries are commonly viewed as simply a place for the dead and grieving, but they also provide unique insight into human nature and history. The wall isn\u2019t there for the dead \u2013 it\u2019s there for the living. The lessons don\u2019t just come from what is written on headstones. We can learn a lot by noting who is buried with who, for example. Or, in the case of Fraser, Gorton and Menzies, by which way they are facing. In 100 years\u2019 time, what will the Prime Ministers\u2019 Garden look like? More full, perhaps, with a second wall \u2013 and the direction of headstones indicating whether old grudges have been forgotten or taken to the grave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
