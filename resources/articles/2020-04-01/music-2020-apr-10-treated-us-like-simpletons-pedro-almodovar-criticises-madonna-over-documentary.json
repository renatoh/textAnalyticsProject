In the post published in translation on IndieWire, Almod\u00f3var recalls first meeting Madonna on the set of the film Dick Tracy, and then later in Madrid during her 1990 Blond Ambition world tour. \u201cAside from myself, she was only interested in meeting one other guest, Antonio Banderas,\u201d he said of the latter meeting, with Banderas having recently acted in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!. \u201cHollywood (and Madonna) had fallen in love with him.\u201d Madonna had the flamenco party Almod\u00f3var had arranged for her filmed for the documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed With Madonna). \u201cShe didn\u2019t ask for permission to use our images, and she even dubbed me, because my English mustn\u2019t have been that good,\u201d Almod\u00f3var complains. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if this seems like a settling of scores \u2013 if it had been the other way round (me filming Madonna and her team and making a film with all that material which I would then premiere around the world), I would have taken such a hit in the form of a lawsuit; I\u2019d still be recovering from it. Madonna treated us like simpletons and I had to say it one day.\u201d He said Madonna decided on the seating plan and placed Banderas\u2019s then-wife Ana Leza far away from him, with herself by his side. \u201cAntonio\u2019s harassment was one of the main storylines and she, obviously, edited in how she dispatched Ana Leza with only one sentence. At the end of the dinner, Ana dared to get close to our table and told the divine blonde sarcastically, \u2018I see you like my husband, it doesn\u2019t surprise me, all women like him, but I don\u2019t mind because I am very modern.\u2019 To which Madonna replied: \u2018Get lost.\u2019 All this may seem frivolous, and it is.\u201d He also says Madonna also asked Banderas, who didn\u2019t speak English then, a provocative question via Almod\u00f3var. \u201cAsk him, she told me again, if he likes women to hit him \u2026 Antonio made the same gesture, which meant neither/nor, but that he was at the service of ladies\u2019 desires.\u201d Madonna has not responded to his post. The Guardian has contacted her UK representatives for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
