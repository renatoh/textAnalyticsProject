Since then, he has dabbled in other genres, notably commercial Bollywood, and now he has produced a movie in the picturesque \"Raj\" vein, this being presented in association with Merchant-Ivory. Linus Roache stars as Henry Moores, an ambitious sahib in Kerala who has borrowed heavily to finance the building of a private road for the fantastically lucrative spice trade. He has formed a close, but painfully unequal relationship with an Indian, TK Neelan (Rahul Bose) and despite being a married man whose wife and young son are about to join him from England, Moores is conducting a dangerous, thrillingly erotic affair with Sajani (Nandita Das), his beautiful Indian maid. The film is fervently acted and well shot, and Das provides a powerful, emotional force, but there is something a little clanky about the whole project, a persistent made-for-TV feel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
