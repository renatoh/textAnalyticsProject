The 26-year-old has been a peripheral figure for David Moyes's team since his \u00a39m arrival from Lokomotiv Moscow in 2009 and recently admitted he would consider leaving the club in January having lost his place in the national team ahead of Euro 2012. Everton will want to recoup around \u00a37m for Bilyaletdinov in January, although the Bundesliga club are believed to value the midfielder closer to \u00a35m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
