With a 105-92 win in Friday night\u2019s Game 4 of the NBA finals, the Raptors took a commanding 3-1 series lead. They are now one win away from the franchise\u2019s first ever championship, while the powerhouse Warriors\u2019 season dangles by a thread. Toronto broke it open during a stunning third quarter. Kawhi Leonard (36 points and 12 rebounds) nailed back-to-back three-pointers in the opening minute of the second-half to give the Raptors their first lead of the game, 48-46. The Raptors went on to outscore the Warriors 37-21 in the period, turning an 11-point first-quarter deficit into a 13-point third quarter advantage, a 24-point reversal. The Raptors outshot the Warriors, 54.5% to 35% in the period. And they made five of their seven three-point attempts, after shooting a dismal 2-for-17 from beyond the arc in the first half. \u201cKawhi\u2019s two big threes to start the half really I thought changed the whole feel of everybody,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cI just thought everybody was like, \u2018OK, man, we know we are here. Let\u2019s go.\u2019 And we just kind of kept going.\u201d The shellshocked Warriors cut their hole to eight points with just under three minutes left after Stephen Curry made a three-pointer, but they couldn\u2019t complete the comeback. The Warriors, so famous for their third-quarter pushes, finally got a taste of their own medicine. \u201cIt sucks really bad,\u201d said Draymond Green, who finished with 10 points, nine rebounds and 12 assists. \u201cYou just try and do whatever you can to change it. Get a stop, get a bucket, get some momentum. Every time we did, they answered.\u201d It was a surprising turn of events considering the Raptors struggled from the get-go, with Leonard scoring 14 of the team\u2019s 17 first-quarter points. The rest of the Raptors were a dismal 1-for-13 from the field in the first 12 minutes. But the Raptors managed to stay in the game despite shooting 34.1% from the field in the first half, entering halftime trailing by just four points, 46-42. The Warriors greatly helped them along the way, notching 10 turnovers during the period, en route to a woeful 19 in the game. \u201cI had faith that it was going to turn around for us,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe were missing a lot of wide-open shots.\u201d Leonard led the Raptors with a NBA finals career-high 36 points on 11-for-22 shooting, including making five of his nine three-point shots. He also had 12 rebounds and four steals. Serge Ibaka had 20 points on 9-for-12 shooting and two blocked shots. Pascal Siakam added 19 points. Fred VanVleet had a bit of a scare after getting inadvertently elbowed in the face by Shaun Livingston with 9:35 left. VanVleet laid on the court for a few moments bleeding with a cut under his right eye. He went on to have seven stitches and was cleared to return. He did not suffer a concussion. Klay Thompson, who missed Game 3 because of a left hamstring sprain that he sustained in Game 2, returned for Game 4. He opened the game with 14 points in 16 minutes on six-for-nine shooting. Normally even-keeled and understated, Thompson couldn\u2019t help losing himself in celebration after making a turnaround jumper with 3:48 left in the first half to put the Warriors up, 42-34. He pointed his finger toward the floor while emphatically nodding his head and even made an obscene gesture with his hands while running downcourt. But the Raptors went on to spoil his return, despite him finishing with a team-high 28 points on 11-for-18 shooting, including 6-for-10 shooting from beyond the arc. Stephen Curry had 27 points, but it took him 22 shots to get them. Kevon Looney (right 1st costal cartilage non-displaced fracture) also returned in Game 4 after he was initially ruled out for the rest of the finals after sustaining the injury in Game 2. He gave the Warriors a boost off the bench with 10 points on 5-for-8 shooting. Kevin Durant missed his ninth straight playoff game because of a right calf strain. Warriors\u2019 coach Steve Kerr said he\u2019s hopeful that he\u2019ll return in Game 5 or 6 \u2013 if there is one. It was an emotional, frenetic contest with nine lead changes. But the Raptors got the best of the experienced Warriors, and they did it in a dramatic fashion in front of a hostile crowd. Now they\u2019re just one game away from making history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
