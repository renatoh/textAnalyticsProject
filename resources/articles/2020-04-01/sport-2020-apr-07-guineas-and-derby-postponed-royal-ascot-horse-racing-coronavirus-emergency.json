If there is an answer to that question, it will be identified this summer, as the 109-year-old event is to be staged behind closed doors, assuming that it goes ahead at all. Fans of horse racing felt the ground shifting beneath their feet when the news was announced on Tuesday afternoon, just moments after Jockey Club officials said the first four Classic races of the year, the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and the Oaks, were to be postponed indefinitely. The Guineas would normally take place at Newmarket in May, the Derby and the Oaks at Epsom in early June, but it is now accepted as impossible to press ahead with such important races on those dates. It was widely imagined that Royal Ascot could also be postponed until, say, late July in the hope that racing might be up and running by then. But many of the races scheduled to take place there are designed for a particular moment in the development of two-year-old and three-year-old thoroughbreds. Delaying them would mean bumping into competing races at other tracks, later in the summer. Those who run the Queen\u2019s track accept it will have to be mid-June or nothing, and they see no prospect, in view of the present restrictions necessitated by coronavirus, of their being allowed to bring in up to 70,000 people per day just two months from now. But Ascot\u2019s spokesman, Nick Smith, waved away a suggestion that the mood among staff must be one of depression. \u201cTo be absolutely honest with you, it isn\u2019t. The things that are going on in the wider world do put this kind of thing into some perspective. \u201cThis is going to be an extremely busy time for the team because we\u2019ve got to make about 10,000 phone calls, make sure all customers are communicated with and understand what\u2019s happening. At least we have the aspiration to run the races and deliver something for the industry. The mood is pretty positive, actually.\u201d While no corks will be popped in the stands, running the races would be of benefit to jockeys, trainers, owners and fans isolated at home in need of entertainment, not to mention punters and bookmakers. It would also provide the bloodstock industry with its essential annual insight into which animals are worth breeding from. \u201cA lot of these races need to be run if we can,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe are a racecourse, that is our raison d\u2019etre.\u201d The Royal meeting is insured but there are uninsured costs, so Ascot is facing what it describes as \u201ca challenging year\u201d which will affect its finances significantly. Prize money levels will have to be reduced, even if the races are staged. \u201cThere will clearly be a material impact on prize money,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality for, I think, all races that are going to be run this year. That\u2019s the landscape we\u2019ll have to operate in. But it is better, I\u2019m sure, to run the Pattern races for the good of the breed and the breeding industry, for TV and betting, than not to run the races at all. We\u2019ll do our best but material prize money reductions will be inevitable.\u201d Nor is it being taken for granted that the Royal races will actually be staged, even behind closed doors, given the current uncertainties. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing,\u201d Smith acknowledged. \u201cGovernmental advice will be clear and so will the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s interpretation of that advice. We will operate within that advice and be happy to do so.\u201d Earlier, the Jockey Club said it would have to postpone its Classic races to provide certainty to trainers of possible contenders. \u201cTrainers need to know whether to step up preparations for their Guineas horses or put that on pause for a later date,\u201d said Amy Starkey, who runs Newmarket. \u201cThe future is too uncertain at the moment and there is no opportunity for any preparation races before such important contests for the 2020 Classic generation.\u201d It means that some of the most important horse races are now in a dateless limbo, as officials must wait to learn when the sport can make some sort of return to action. Only then will it be possible to identify new dates for the two Guineas races, the Derby and the Oaks, generation-defining contests which will be saved even if it means running them months out of their usual slots."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
