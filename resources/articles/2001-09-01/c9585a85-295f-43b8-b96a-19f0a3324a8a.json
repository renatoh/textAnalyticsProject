Recently, however, the Hayles hex has spread to the entire six-man squad, who have left a trail of broken bikes and bruised bodies behind them prior to next week's world track championships in Antwerp, culminating in a training pile-up this week. \"They are cursed at the moment,\" said the former professional John Herety, who has supervised their preparation this year. \"They have had an extraordinary amount of bad luck over the last few weeks.\" The accidents have weakened a strong team, comprising Paul Manning, Bryan Steel, Chris Newton, Jon Clay, Bradley Wiggins and Hayles, who last year took bronze in Sydney in the team pursuit, then won silver in the world championships in Manchester. But Hayles, for one, will not be there next week. He was given \"the unluckiest cyclist\" tag in Sydney after he fell off within sight of a medal in the madison relay event, but that title was put into perspective 2 weeks ago when he and his wife, the Olympic swimmer Vicky Horner, were in a car accident near Oxford, which left him with a broken pelvis, two broken ribs and needing a 3-hour operation. But Hayles's road accident was not the first suffered by a team member in a freakish run of bad luck. A week before, a car had crashed into Manning as he was riding down a Manchester street. Cuts to his upper arm required two operations and two weeks' rest. He can now ride his bike but the effects of this week's training crash on his existing wounds have yet to be assessed. Neither did the curse spare the 21-year-old Wiggins, who was oozing confidence after a series of races in Belgium when, on September 11, a tarpaulin blew off a skip as he was training in west London and knocked him off his bike. He fractured two small bones in his wrist, can now only train on a stationary bike and is likely to race with the limb in plaster. The crash may also affect his chances of a medal in Antwerp in the individual pursuit. Fortunately Wiggins was an onlooker on Monday, as five of the team - Manning, Steel and Newton, plus the newcomers Steve Cummings and Tim Buckle - were putting in a session at over 40mph at the Manchester velodrome. A small bolt securing Manning's saddle came loose. \"His seat fell off; we were absolutely flat out,\" said Steel yesterday, \"so Paul came off, Steve hit Paul, and Tim rode into the back of Steve.\" There were no broken bones, merely abrasions and the destruction of two \u00a33,500 bikes. \"Morale is OK, although Paul was just over an injury and now he's cut up again,\" said Steel. \"We're just hoping all the bad luck is done and we get some good luck next week.\" Sounding like a man trying to see the bright side, he added: \"No one got hurt at all on Monday apart from loss of skin.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
