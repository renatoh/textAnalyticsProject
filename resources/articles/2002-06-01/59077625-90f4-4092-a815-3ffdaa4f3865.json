The investigation, to be screened next Tuesday as part of the series Kenyon Confronts, will also include an anonymous interview with a recently-retired jockey, who claims that he frequently took payments to stop fancied horses. Murphy was one of a number of trainers approached in recent months by Kenyon, who was posing as an antiques dealer and keen punter eager to have a horse in training. Kenyon said yesterday that he was not aware of the existence of betting exchanges -which allow clients to lay horses to lose as well as back them to win - before he met Murphy, and that the trainer volunteered the information about standing one of his horses during a wider discussion about owning and backing horses. If correct, the claim that such a prominent trainer laid his own horse would be acutely embarrassing, not simply for Murphy, but for the sport as a whole. However, the trainer insisted yesterday that he does not even have an account with Betfair, that he \"has never had a bet with them in my life,\" and that he made his comments to protect the identity of one of his owners. \"All they were interested in was getting me to say that I would stop horses,\" Murphy said. \"They were on all the time saying they wanted to gamble and they wanted horses stopped. I told them there was no future in doing that, but they weren't interested. \"As it went on, I got more and more uneasy, and eventually I told them you don't have to own horses to gamble, you can go and do it on Betfair.\" Murphy says he then told the reporters about the bet placed to win \u00a31,600 on Betfair when one of his horses was beaten. \"A friend of an owner of mine overheard me ringing the owner in Ireland to tell him that I'd got to the races, the ground had gone totally against his horse, and that he shouldn't back it. \"When I rang him that night to report on how the horse ran, he said that a friend of his had won the \u00a31,600. \"As I was talking to them, I said that I'd had the bet to protect the owner, but I've never had a bet with Betfair in my life. As it turned out, I did the right thing, because I wouldn't have wanted his name dragged through the mud.\" Kenyon said yesterday that anonymous interviewees who will appear in the programme include a retired jockey, who will claim that he made more money from stopping horses than he did from winning on them, and an ex-bookie who will allege he paid \"several top jockeys\" to stop horses. Both Kenyon and the programme's producer, Paul Woolwich, insist that their investigation was designed to protect the interests of punters. \"You get the feeling that there's a conspiracy,\" Kenyon said, \"that people involved that are very close to racing, the trainers and jockeys, know what goes on and are obviously intent on keeping that out of the public domain.\" Woolwich said that the trainers interviewed for the programme had volunteered information freely. \"The onus is about holding horses back,\" he said. \"It is about deliberate non-trying, and once you gave them an indication that that's what you were in the market for, it was not pulling teeth. \"We're not talking about one bad apple. We approached six or seven, and only one turned around and was adamant that he wanted nothing to do with it.\" Woolwich also criticised the lack of input to the programme from the Jockey Club. \"There's a very strong racing establishment which tends to close ranks,\" he said. John Maxse, the Jockey Club's spokesman, said yesterday that the Club had been \"very tempted\" to offer Kenyon an interview. However, he added that \"having thought about it very carefully, we were not sufficiently confident that our view would be accurately reflected.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
