Instead of more troops on the ground, defence secretary Geoff Hoon is leading the charge to use advanced communications technology. The announcement caused outcry. Proponents of what the MoD calls network-enabled capability (NEC) say it will help keep soldiers properly equipped by improving logistics and will help them work more effectively and safely in dangerous situations. \"It allows information to flow,\" said an MoD spokesman. \"The technology allows you to do things you couldn't do before.\" The defence command paper released by Hoon in July - which publicised plans to close or merge foot regiments, scrap Royal Navy ships and ditch RAF squadrons - defines NEC as \"the coherent integration of sensors, decision-makers and weapons systems.\" Government IT projects do not always have shining reputations, but Giles Ebbutt, the editor of Jane's C4I Yearbook, says that much of the technology in the plan already exists. He believes it is entirely reasonable that the rest should be ready by 2010. \"There's no doubt you need the capability they are introducing. If we're going to continue to be a viable partner in any meaningful coalition, we need to be able to do these things. How you gain that capability is then a matter for political judgment.\" The MoD's paper anticipates the UK working regularly with the US military, and the Pentagon is already particularly keen on what it calls network-centric warfare. Some critics say NEC is extremely useful in high intensity operations such as full-scale war, but less useful for work such as distributing aid. With low intensity operations becoming increasingly common, some fear that replacing troops with complex technology will weaken the capability on the ground and endanger important peacekeeping missions. \"Commanders in Iraq last year said they didn't see how some swanky new technology would help. What helped was people on the ground patrolling,\" says Francis Tusa, editor of the Defence Analysis newsletter. He says this particularly applies to plans to create \"digitised battlespace\" by tracking the location of all vehicles and individuals on a battlefield. The MoD announced a pilot of this Joint Effects Tactical Targeting System two months ago. Tusa says that a peacekeeping \"battlefield\" can contain tens of thousands of vehicles and individuals, and that the difference between neutrals and enemies may be their intentions rather than any physical sign. He thinks commanders could become reliant on digitised battlespace software, leading to the problem \"that the default is 'shoot and sort out later'\". Such a move could turn neutral civilians into sworn enemies, threatening the sanctity of peacekeeping operations and placing troops in greater danger than ever. Another problem is that such low intensity operations are by their nature more labour intensive, and NEC is being introduced as personnel is being cut. Iraq's high-level warfare took a matter of days, while the effort to bring civil peace and order is a much more long-term engagement. \"If you're doing peacekeeping work, you don't always need hi-tech capability,\" says Paul Keetch, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman. \"What you need is a huge number of infantry and transport aircraft.\" Others, however, see networked communications as essential in low intensity work. \"People think soldiers on the ground don't need technology when winning hearts and minds,\" says Ellie Goldsworthy, a defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. \"But they need to be able to react quickly, and getting the right information at the right time enables them to do that.\" She believes her use of computer technology was important in her postings on peace support operations in the Balkans, where situational awareness and reliable communications were crucial. For her, the problem with NEC is in presentation: it is not explained, for example, as a way of tracking equipment more accurately. \"Geoff Hoon sells it so dreadfully,\" she says. \"If he explained that investment in new technology would mean body armour would stand a better chance of getting to the soldiers who needed it, he might get a warmer reaction.\" But could soldiers become over-reliant on technology? Could they become so much a part of a network that they are useless when disconnected? Goldsworthy says British military training avoids the dependence on technology. \"Every soldier has training for what happens when the radios go wrong. There's never a total reliance on technology.\" But Tusa points out that some US units no longer teach map reading, since soldiers rely on global positioning systems. \"A map with a bullet hole is slightly soiled, but a computer with a bullet hole is an expensive paperweight,\" he says.
