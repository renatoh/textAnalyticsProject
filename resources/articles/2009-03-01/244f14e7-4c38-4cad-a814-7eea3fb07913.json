A provision of last month's massive stimulus bill, the Employ American Workers Act, essentially forbids banks that receive government money from hiring workers with H-1B visas for two years. Those visas allow companies to temporarily hire educated foreign workers for specialized occupations, and are often used by high-tech companies. A foreign worker can hold H-1B status for up to six years. Hiring visa holders isn't normally such a point of contention for banks; even the largest users of the program, such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, apply for only a couple hundred H-1B visas each year. But banks are under increasing scrutiny from legislators who lent them billions in taxpayer dollars, and the industry's thousands of newly laid-off workers are apt to be angry over any hint that they were replaced by foreign workers. The two senators who co-sponsored Employ American Workers rode that sentiment last month when the stimulus bill was passed. \"While we are suffering through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the very least we can do is to make sure that banks receiving a taxpayer bailout are not allowed to import cheaper labor from overseas while they are throwing American workers out on the street,\" said Independent senor Bernie Sanders from Vermont. \"There is no need for companies to hire foreign guest workers ... when there are plenty of qualified Americans looking for jobs,\" added Republican senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. Immigration advocates offered a scathing assessment of the new law, calling it jingoist and divisive. They also said it would be counterproductive, by encouraging offshoring and other unintended consequences. \"Instead of seeing the current economic calamity as a global problem and immigrants as part of the collective solution, the Senate unwisely chose to restrict the financial industry's access to top-flight global talent who can help create jobs for US workers,\" the American Immigration Lawyers Association said in a statement. \"In these difficult economic times, we cannot afford knee-jerk, fear-driven policies that will stymie growth. Our nation's capacity to funnel the world's diverse talent pool into a highly productive economic engine is a central reason that we are the wealthiest nation in history.\" Charlotte-based Bank of America declined to say how many job offers it had to withdraw, though the number was probably negligible compared to the overall work force. Bank spokeswoman Sara Bloomquist said that H-1B visa holders comprise significantly less than 1% of the bank's 240,000 employee base. It's been speculated that the bank withdrew about 50 job offers. According to data from the department of labour, Bank of America submitted fewer than 100 applications for H-1B visas in 2008, with job titles such as \"consultant applications programmer\" or \"risk control lead engineer\". \"Bank of America had very much looked forward to these individuals joining the company,\" Bloomquist said. The Employ American Workers Act is not an outright ban on hiring those workers; rather, it says that banks cannot hire a visa holder unless they can prove that they're not replacing a laid-off American worker. Because Bank of America, like many of its peers, is cutting thousands of jobs, the law effectively freezes its hiring of visa holders. It's another sign of the government's ever-expanding power over Bank of America and other banks that have received bailout loans. The government, which has lent $45bn to Bank of America, has already forced the bank to slash its dividend payout to shareholders, restrict its share repurchases, disclose its executive compensation plan for government approval and other measures. The visa provision wasn't the only banking law wedged into the stimulus bill last month. Democratic senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut inserted a law forbidding top officers at all banks that receive government money from earning bonuses greater than one-third of their total annual compensation. For the largest banks, that provision would apply for about the top 25 officers \"or such higher number as the [treasury] secretary determines is in the public interest.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
