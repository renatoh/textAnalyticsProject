The situation came to a head on Wednesday when Danny Higginbotham, a \u00a33.5m buy from Manchester United, served 14 days' notice on Derby because of what he termed \"a breach of contract\". \"We are grateful for the bank's support in paying the players' wages while discussions continue on the reorganisation of the club,\" said a spokesman for Derby, who are the subject of rival takeover bids. \"All of the players will be paid first thing on Friday morning and we will continue to work closely with the bank.\" The fall-out from Roy Keane's autobiography continued yesterday when a Manchester United director said the club would try to ban players from putting their names to books until they leave. David Gill, in Bangkok to secure a commercial deal for the Old Trafford club, said: \"We don't think it's appropriate for players to publish a book while they're still playing for Manchester United. We want them to concentrate on playing.\" Gill will be dismayed to learn that Penguin has rights to the paperback version of Keane's autobiography and it may be published any time in the next 18 months, probably with an update featuring last Saturday's sending off for elbowing Jason McAteer at Sunderland. David Beckham, moreover, has recently agreed a deal to publish his second autobiography. \"You can't apply rules retrospectively,\" Gill admitted. \"If he's signed a contract, we're not in a position to deny him that opportunity.\" Thereafter, however, United will endeavour to do just that, though whether such a policy can be enforced remains to be seen. \"We believe they can do other commercial deals,\" Gill said. \"A book is another issue.\" With Keane facing two charges of bringing the game into disrepute because of remarks concerning a tackle on Alf Inge Haaland in April 2001, Gill said that United's lawyers had not seen the book prior to publication. Sir Alex Ferguson stated previously that he had read the book. \"I'm sure the publisher's lawyers looked at it, his lawyers looked at it. Manchester United, our in-house lawyers, did not look at it,\" Gill said. \"It's going to go through the process and clearly we will support Roy as a key player within Manchester United.\" Arsenal's defender Matthew Upson, 23, has joined Reading on a three-month loan. St Mirren have sacked their manager Tom Hendrie; his assistant John Coughlin takes charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
