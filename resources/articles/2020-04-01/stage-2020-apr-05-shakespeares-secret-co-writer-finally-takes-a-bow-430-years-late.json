Now the writer, poet and pioneer of the English madrigal \u2013 who also saved the life of the playwright Christopher Marlowe in a street brawl \u2013 is being seen in a new light. Watson has been identified as the most likely primary author of Arden of Faversham, the first domestic tragedy in English, which was published anonymously in 1592. Many scholars believe that five of the play\u2019s scenes were co-authored with William Shakespeare. Based on a notorious murder of 1551, Arden is about a woman from Faversham, Kent, who conspires with her lover to kill her husband and struggles to \u201cwash away this blood\u201d, just like Lady Macbeth. Over five years of research, Professor Gary Taylor, a leading Shakespeare scholar, has found stylistic, biographical and historical links to Watson in almost every scene. He concludes that there is \u201cstrong and consistent evidence\u201d for his authorship. Watson was a polymath whose talents extended from writing poetry in Latin to creating the first published set of English madrigals. In 1595, Shakespeare was described as \u201cWatson\u2019s heire\u201d by William Clerke, in a work titled Polimanteia, but only recently have scholars even realised that Watson was a playwright. \u201cAlmost everything Watson did was original,\u201d said Taylor, professor of literature at Florida State University and general editor of The New Oxford Shakespeare. \u201cEven specialists only know one tiny aspect of his work, instead of putting it all together.\u201d Taylor\u2019s new research will be published in The Review of English Studies later this year. He is also among leading contributors to Early Shakespeare, 1588-1594, a major reappraisal of Shakespeare\u2019s early career, to be published this month by Cambridge University Press. This will contain essays on Arden by other scholars. Dr Rory Loughnane, its co-editor and a senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: \u201cTaylor\u2019s identification of Watson\u2019s hand in Arden \u2026 is a major finding, not least for our understanding of Shakespeare\u2019s early career. Though obscure now, Watson was a polymath and, like his close friend Marlowe, a celebrated poet, translator and dramatist. Watson was also extremely well-connected within London\u2019s literary scene; that he collaborated with Shakespeare, who was then in his mid-20s, reveals the sorts of influential circles the ambitious Stratford man moved in at the very beginning of his career.\u201d Taylor said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a writer who is capable of writing a great play. Watson was greatly admired at the time, celebrated for tragic plays before Marlowe or Shakespeare became famous.\u201d Arden authorship contenders have included Thomas Kyd, who wrote The Spanish Tragedy. Taylor said: \u201cWatson looks more likely than any other writer of the 1580s or early 1590s. As a native Londoner with legal training, born in the 1550s and praised by his contemporaries as an early master of tragedy in the commercial theatres, Watson shares the biographical profile that first led critics to suspect Kyd\u2019s hand in the play.\u201d He added: \u201cA lot of the material is funny, and Watson \u2026 was also famously funny. In 1596, one writer remembered \u2018the froth of witty Tom Watson\u2019s jests\u2019.\u201d Among other biographical evidence, Taylor draws parallels between Arden and Watson\u2019s defence of Marlowe when he was attacked in the street in 1589: \u201cThe husband who would be famously murdered is defended by a friend in an earlier attack. That incident in the play is not in the historical sources. It\u2019s totally made up by the playwright. The friend is also totally made up.\u201d Taylor has compared Arden with Watson\u2019s surviving literary prose and poetry, using databases of playwrights working between 1585 and 1595. The study revealed that \u201csome features of Arden are shared with no one but Watson\u201d. He added: \u201cIf Watson did write most of Arden, then we need to seriously consider him for other plays written before September 1592 when he died, probably of the plague.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
