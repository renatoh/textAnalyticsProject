Brooking was contacted yesterday by Richard Lewis, the current Sport England chair, to explain that an independent inquiry had been set up into the World Class Payments Bureau, which made payments to athletes and administrators at the request of minor sports' governing bodies between 1999 and 2007. Lewis then made public his inquiry into the off-balance-sheet account which was uncovered when a bank statement was sent to Sport England's headquarters in Bloomsbury, London, last December. Following an internal inquiry it is now known the account received payments of \u00a319.7m over eight years. Lewis is determined to uncover whether any fraudulent practices have taken place and to recover the money where possible. Police involvement has not been ruled out. Sport England distributes funds to national governing bodies through a formal awards process. But throughout the time the World Class Payments Bureau was operating, some awards to smaller sports' governing bodies were officially put through the books, but in actuality diverted to the secret account. This ensured payments to individuals rather than recognised bodies would be possible; and because the books balanced it went unnoticed for years. \"Because it sat outside the audited accounts we can't say every penny was spent in the right way,\" said a source with knowledge of the investigation. There is no suggestion that Brooking, who chaired Sport England from 1999 to 2002, was involved in authorising unaudited payments nor that he was even aware the World Class Payments Bureau existed. But the inquiry's lead investigator, the QC Tim Dutton, will ask questions of all senior Sport England figures from the time of the account being set up and will want details of the processes that allowed auditors to be fooled for so long. Brooking, who is now the Football Association's director of football development, declined to comment last night, although sources close to him stressed that all accounting processes were conducted by a sub-audit committee of which he was not a part. Derek Casey, chief executive of Sport England in 1999, could not be contacted. Lewis said yesterday: \"It is concerning that a bank account operated outside the usual financial controls of Sport England. This fell short of the procedures and safeguards now in place in this organisation. Since her appointment as chief executive in April 2007, Jennie Price has made financial governance a priority. It is on Jennie's recommendation as accounting officer that I am today appointing an independent investigation.\" Sport England refused to comment when asked if it had documentary details of payments made. Despite the vast sums of public money involved, there will be concerns that the inquiry, which is expected to run until September, will have no formal powers to subpoena individuals suspected of embezzlement. The inquiry has sparked a party-political row, with the shadow sports minister, Hugh Robertson, accusing Labour of dictating \"close political control over the organisation\". He added: \"It is vital that the inquiry announced today has full and uninhibited access to all the relevant paperwork inside [the Department of Culture, Media and Sport] as well as Sport England.\" Richard Caborn, the sports minister from 2001 to 2007, has told friends he knew nothing of its existence. BOA leaves Stones behind The British Olympic Association will today announce a move away from its headquarters in Wandsworth, setting tongues wagging that Mick Jagger, the owner of a neighbouring property, will now be moving in. But the BOA has confirmed Jagger is not the purchaser and so will not be rolling stones in the partition walls. Mosley fights Fota Max Mosley's publicly stated belief that \"an element\" within the Formula One Teams Association (Fota) seems hell-bent on destruction of otherwise \"very constructive\" relations with the teams is at odds with correspondence his organisation has been receiving from Fota. A press release the FIA issued on Monday depicted broad accord with the teams, while highlighting supposed divisions within Fota. But how does that sit with a letter sent by the constructors \u2013 to which the eight leading teams are co-signatories? It went to all the FIA senate and world council members, bypassing Mosley altogether after a \"breakdown in communications and cooperation\", accusing his organisation of an \"unstable governance process\". Pompey play market Even though Sulaiman al-Fahim's \"takeover\" of Portsmouth might never take place, the announcement of his \"due diligence\" into the transaction has been to the mutual benefit of the Abu Dhabi businessman and the Fratton Park club. Not only has his name received huge attention in recent weeks, but Pompey can conduct their summer transfer negotiations on a very different footing. Earlier this year football was abuzz with rumours about Portsmouth's financial difficulties, prompting clubs to covet their players at knock-down prices. But if a \"billionaire\" Arab businessman pops up to \"buy\" the club, the appearance of money troubles is swept away and suddenly you can agree an \u00a318.5m deal for a full-back. Play up Pompey! Fergie fixture moan Sir Alex Ferguson has no right to complain, as he did last year, that Manchester United have been specifically \"handicapped\" by the way the fixtures \u2013 announced today \u2013 fall. Because alongside a representative from Fulham, the FA and supporters' groups in the Fixtures Working Party is none other than Ken Ramsden, the club secretary of \u2026 Manchester United."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
