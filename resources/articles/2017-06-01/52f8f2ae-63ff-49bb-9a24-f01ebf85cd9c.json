Neither Donald Trump nor European officials raised the possible resumption of talks during the US president\u2019s visit to Brussels last month, EU sources said. Documents relating to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, known as TTIP, had now been locked in a filing cabinet and the code to open it had been lost, one diplomat joked. It was reported in April that the UK had fallen behind in the queue to strike a trade deal with Trump\u2019s administration. According to the Times, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, had convinced Trump that talks on a US-EU agreement would be simpler than he thought. This had led to a \u201crealisation\u201d that a trade deal with the EU \u2013 allowing the tariff-free exchange of services and goods \u2013 would be more important to US interests than a post-Brexit deal with Theresa May, it was reported. Talks over TTIP stalled last year amid opposition from within the EU, including sceptical comments from France\u2019s then trade minister and the German vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel. However, a meeting between Trump the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European council president, Donald Tusk, two weeks ago offered the EU scant evidence of any such willingness, according to EU sources. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come up,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe not entirely dead but it is in deep freeze\u201d. The source said that the completion of an EU-Japan trade deal was nevertheless imminent, and would provide significant economic gains. The development may offer Downing Street some fresh hope that the UK stands a better chance of engaging with Washington than Brussels does. May has appeared less inclined to criticise the White House for its recent policy tacks \u2013 including leaving the Paris climate agreement \u2013 suggesting that the prime minister believes the UK stands a chance of forging an accord with the US administration if it avoids upsetting the president. In Brussels, though, there is a high degree of scepticism about the UK\u2019s chances of getting a deal. \u201cTrump would have to be taught what trade means first,\u201d one EU diplomat said. The source added that it was questionable whether the UK had the expertise to engage with the US administration on a trade deal. \u201cA UK-US trade deal would probably take 10 to 15 years anyway\u201d, the diplomat said. The UK\u2019s attitude to the coming Brexit negotiations had given EU diplomats little evidence of such a capacity, the source added. \u201cTheresa May keeps saying she the chief negotiator. Is she really going to spend six days a week in Brussels negotiating? \u201cIf it is David Davis, fine. If it is Olly Robins [permanent secretary of the Department for Exiting the European Union] then fine, he knows the files, although maybe less the economic ones. We need to know who we are negotiating with ... I don\u2019t think they have a plan.\u201d The warnings of a freeze in trade talks come despite upbeat comments in April from the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. He said before Trump\u2019s first foreign tour that the US was \u201copen\u201d to resuming negotiations with Brussels. \u201cClearly at some point we need to do something with Europe,\u201d Ross said in an interview with the Financial Times. \u201cIt seems a little weird that a car being shipped from Mexico to Europe pays no tariff as they have a bilateral [agreement with the EU] and a car being shipped from the US pays the full tariff.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
