Aztecs", "bodyText": "Aztec culture is not for the bleeding-heart liberal, not least because it involves so many bleeding hearts. Step inside the British Museum's new celebration of their last great leader, Moctezuma II, and you will be greeted by a great silver eagle used for storing the organ. The Aztecs are said to have chosen the spot for their capital by tossing a heart in the air, and to mark special occasions they would light a celebratory fire in the hollowed-out chest of a victim. The gore extends to the head, with masks fashioned from real skulls, albeit skulls encrusted with alternate stripes of turquoise and lignite. The craftsmanship, however, is less impressive than the complex dual calendar, which achieved great accuracy although it mixed ritualistic and solar elements. Then there is the hieroglyphic-style writing, not to mention the almost-psychedelic art that resembles the cover of Disraeli Gears, which it predates by around 500 years. By the time the conquistadors arrived in 1519-20 in what is now Mexico City, the conurbation already housed 200,000 people, around four times more than London back then. The Aztecs remind us that there is nothing uniquely European about the forward march of technical progress. As for European claims of moral advancement, never forget that gunpowder settled the clash of civilisations. Had things played out differently, Aztec museums might now allow us to marvel at scary savages who slaughtered their enemies by blasting fire out of the end of a tube."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
