He is trying to replace Michael Heseltine, another flamboyant politician whose shock of blond hair is also beyond human control. Like most Tory candidates, Boris is surrounded by a band of Protective Gentlefolk. \"I know you from somewhere!\" says an elderly man, in a puzzled sort of way. \"Yes, from Have I Got News For You. He was the tub of lard,\" I explained, only somewhat erroneously. One of the PGs shot me a look of pure hatred, and quite right too. This is their one chance to drag their man out of the shared media and politicians' snakepit, in which we slither all over each other, hissing with hatred, but hopelessly knotted together. Boris has two problems. First, his clothing. It would be unfair to say it looks as if he dresses at a charity shop, because no charity shop would accept stuff in that condition. The suit was obviously bought pre-crumpled. The shirt collar is frayed, and his black brogue shoes have obviously been attacked by vicious, leather-eating moths. Second, he is too honest. He can't help saying what he means. I asked how William Hague was playing on the doorstep and he replied, \"Huge, oh huge!\" But that is not true, and so he can't leave it there. He made massive, swooping, burying-head-in-hands motions, to show what he really meant. A woman said she had always voted Tory, but not this time. \"You don't engage me at all. You have too many people in the party now who are from a different planet entirely. And you're going to win and be in a morale-destroying minority, when you could have a much better time editing the Spectator. And what about your wife and children?\" Boris groaned, presumably because he suspected she was right on all counts. He ran his fingers through his increasingly manic hair. He must keep a pitchfork in his back pocket for when it needs straightening. We fought our way past the potted plants, the barbecues, the packaged gazebos, and a bizarre wickerwork water feature. A woman told us she had decided not to vote Labour because of John Prescott. \"We don't want people like that in power.\" \"Great stuff, great stuff!\" said Boris. There aren't all that many Tories around in what should be a very safe seat. One of the PGs said that around 30% of the voters were undecided, and it certainly looked that way. He can't bear to pretend he knows when he doesn't. \"Key issue! That's a key issue! You are not the first person to raise it with me, and I don't know what the answer is.\" He is beginning to remind me a lot of Willie Whitelaw. We drive off to a Q&amp;A session with all the candidates for the local radio station. A caller asks what right Boris has to represent the area. \"Well! Ha! As you know, I have a residence here. It's unusual, because it's not a Palladian mansion, nor has it got an arboretum to speak of, more a sort of lopsided shrub.\" Locals will know what this means. It means: \"I am not a distant grandee living in parkland like old Hezza was.\" So Boris is running against his predecessor! Against the Lion King, Tarzan, the former president of the Board of Trade! This man has balls of brass! He is probed on the single currency. Would we never join the euro? \"Never!\" he exclaimed. But was that party policy? \"Never - in the next five years!\" he grins, to appreciative laughter. Being Boris means conducting a permanent post-mortem on everything you have just said. \"Under our system, we can kick the bastards out.\" Later he was uncertain about the word \"bastards\". Would people complain? He looks tired and anxious, perhaps wondering at first light if he has made a terrible mistake. \"I really do have to say what I think,\" he says ruefully. \"It would be a complete nightmare otherwise.\" Of course the whips have ready-made, off-the-shelf nightmares for MPs who say what they think. As Boris may be about to learn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
