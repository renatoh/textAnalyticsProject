The promise is part of a Whitehall compact in which ministers promise to take \"clear and timely policy decisions\", while leaving officials free to take operational decisions and to deploy staff and resources. In return senior civil servants promise to deliver the services and provide \"accurate advice to ministers\". They have pledged to understand \"the political and wider context\" and to ensure ministers are told promptly about issues that affect the reputation of the department and could attract negative headlines. This clarification of the split of responsibilities between \"policy\" and \"operations\" carries echoes of Home Office internal battles through the years and was criticised last night as a \"one-sided deal to cover the backs of ministers\". The compact makes clear that those in charge of operational services such as Lin Homer, head of immigration and nationality, and Phil Wheatley, director-general of the prison service, will be expected to increasingly answer to the media for operational decisions they take. The compact has been agreed as plans are finalised for a delivery unit to be set up within the Home Office to tackle the roots of the crises that have rocked the department and led to the removal of Charles Clarke as home secretary last year. The compact was slipped in yesterday as an update on the home secretary, John Reid's drive to make the Home Office \"fit for purpose\" revealed that there have been 18 changes among the 52 directors in the department since last July. Ten have left their jobs - three to take early retirement and three to go to other departments - and some of their replacements have come direct from the private sector. \"Inevitably, when you are looking for weaknesses in your system - as we are now - you're likely to find some. What matters is how you deal with them. For our part, we intend to fix them,\" says a Home Office statement. But the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said the compact sounded like \"a grubby and one-sided deal\" to cover the backs of government ministers. \"Any meaningful deal between ministers and civil servants should be based on an undertaking from ministers that they will put competence before spin and the public interest before their own public image.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
