In her 1980s pomp, her hair a startling wedge, her skin as glossy as armour, she resembled some kind of fabulous cyborg. You half-expect her to emerge from storage, revived and rebooted, and the reality is not too far off. Heralded by a fanfare of green lasers, she appears in a corset and eye mask, her musculature uncannily perfect. Even in her prime, Jones's musical achievements as an avant garde post-disco diva were overshadowed by her other roles: Amazonian model, pop art muse, Bond villain, thumper of chat-show host Russell Harty. \"Eccentric\" is too cuddly a word; she is bizarre. Between songs, she disappears into the wings to change costumes, making comments in the darkness in an accent migrating between Jamaica, New York and Alpha Centauri, punctuated by gales of stage-villain laughter. \"I'm coming out naked,\" she jokes. \"No, I don't want to get arrested before the end of the show.\" (In 1998, she exposed her breasts on stage at Disney World, earning her a lifelong ban from the kingdom of Walt.) Each time she emerges with a new, far-fetched garment: a hat like an up-ended dinner plate, another like a Thai temple, yet another with laser-reflecting mirrors. She is both an on-going performance art project, as befits someone who was acquainted with Andy Warhol and Keith Haring, and someone who just relishes dressing up. The music does not always hold its own, with too many formless dub grooves. Her first album since 1989 is imminent, and the new material punches its weight, with Corporate Cannibal, an ominous, almost sexual reflection on predatory capitalism. The set gathers pace via her celebrated covers - La Vie en Rose, Love Is the Drug, Warm Leatherette - and the riotous Pull Up to the Bumper. What resonates most, though, is not any one song but Jones's unparalleled presence. She is a thrilling reminder of the days when parents spluttered with disbelief at the extravagant creatures that bestrode Top of the Pops, while their children realised with delight that there was a wonderful, scary world out there to which they were not yet privy. During Nipple to the Bottle, Jones enlists a shellshocked man in the front row to parrot her vocals. His first attempt is not up to scratch. \"Say it like you mean it,\" she commands. He complies. How could he not? \u00b7 A version of this review appeared in later editions of yesterday's paper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
