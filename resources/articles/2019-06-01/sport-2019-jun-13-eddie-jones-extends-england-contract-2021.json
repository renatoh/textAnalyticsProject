The Rugby Football Union\u2019s new chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has also revealed Jones could still be in charge for the 2023 World Cup in France. It represents another shift in RFU policy after Jones\u2019s contract was extended through to 2021 by Sweeney\u2019s predecessor, Steve Brown, in January 2018 but with a break clause should England fail to reach the semi-finals in Japan. Sweeney, who took office in May, confirmed that there would be a review if England flop in Japan but he firmly expects Jones to stay, so much so that he has handed the defence coach John Mitchell a new contract until 2021 at the Australian\u2019s request. Jones has hinted in the past he may leave his role regardless of how England fare in Japan but Sweeney said: \u201cEddie is contracted to 2021. He said very clearly to me, \u2018I\u2019m committed to staying to \u201821, I\u2019m not looking to go anywhere else.\u2019 You can only take somebody at their word and he said he is committed to stay till 2021.\u201d Asked if Jones and Mitchell may stay until the 2023 tournament, Sweeney said: \u201cIt is possible. The focus now is really on the World Cup and then making sure we get our plans in place post-World Cup. Eddie has reconfirmed his commitment through to 2021. From that perspective we\u2019ve already started conversations around what will the coaching team be coming back from Japan. He has got a number of names in the frame.\u201d Brown had wanted to identify Jones\u2019s successor before this year\u2019s World Cup and his stated plan was to have the new head coach in place at the end of the 2019-20 season, claiming \u201cwe absolutely needed a succession process\u201d. The new head coach was supposed to lead a developmental England side on the 2020 summer tour of Japan with Jones taking a back seat. In effect it was a way of tying Jones down when his stock was at its highest \u2013 he had just been named coach of the year \u2013 before freeing him up to coach the British &amp; Irish Lions. Brown lasted just over a year, however, with Sweeney, who has been brought in to stem the union\u2019s financial losses, in effect ripping up that plan, claiming it would have been a distraction to make plans before this year\u2019s World Cup, despite France, Ireland, Wales and Italy doing so. \u201cI think any other speculation prior to that would be really disruptive to the situation.\u201d This is not the first time the RFU\u2019s succession plan has changed. When Jones was appointed by Ian Ritchie at the end of 2015, he said that \u201ca fundamental part of my job\u201d was to groom one of his assistants to take over. Paul Gustard has left however, and Steve Borthwick \u2013 though a valued RFU employee \u2013 is not head coach material. That left Brown eager to extend Jones\u2019s contract, with the obvious caveat of a break clause, while Nigel Melville, who filled in on a temporary basis until Sweeney\u2019s arrival, had claimed the union was drawing up two lists of candidates to take the job either immediately after the World Cup, or in 2021, depending on England\u2019s performance in Japan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
