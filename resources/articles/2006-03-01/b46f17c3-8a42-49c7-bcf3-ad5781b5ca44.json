The mild-mannered postman from Greendale will make his first appearance on Germany TV screens after broadcaster Super RTL bought the rights to air the show in the country. Following in the footsteps of Basil Brush - or Herr Brush as he is known in Germany - Postman Pat will launch in Germany this year as part of RTL's pre-school programming Toggolino, giving him access to more than 38m German homes. Chloe van den Berg, director of international at Entertainment Rights said: \"Super RTL's entertaining yet universally trusted TV and online platforms are the ideal home for the Postman Pat brand. \"We look forward to working closely with Super RTL and we are sure that with our combined expertise the Postman Pat brand will become a firm favourite with German pre-schoolers.\" The show has now been sold to over 100 countries around the globe including the five key territories of the US, UK, Japan, France and Germany. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
