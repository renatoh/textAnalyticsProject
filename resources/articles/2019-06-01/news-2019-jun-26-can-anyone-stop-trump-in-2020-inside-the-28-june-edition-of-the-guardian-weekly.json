Inside the 28 June edition of the Guardian Weekly", "bodyText": "Donald Trump launched his 2020 re-election campaign with a typically rambunctious display in Orlando, Florida.

The Democratic contenders hoping to stop him lined up to debate each other this week, can a candidate emerge from a historically crowded field to make Trump the first single-term president since George HW Bush? Last week British Conservative MPs chose the two candidates who will runoff to be the next prime minister. Boris Johnson easily won the most votes from colleagues.

We also feature reports from Istanbul, where correspondent Bethan McKernan wonders what President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s response to his AKP party\u2019s seismic defeat in the city\u2019s mayoral election will be. We also look behind the scenes of the Iranian shooting of a US drone that briefly brought the US to the brink of war with Iran. This weekend marks 50 years since the Stonewall riots. The uprising against police harassment at the New York City bar marked the beginning of the modern LGBT movement. Those who were there tell Ed Pilkington why they chose to resist. We also have a fascinating feature by Simon Parkin on the rise of \u201cdeep fakes\u201d \u2013 the AI-based tool to make fake, but unerringly real-looking, videos of politicians and celebrities \u201cspeaking\u201d.
