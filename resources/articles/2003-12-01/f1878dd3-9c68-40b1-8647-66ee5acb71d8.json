It also effectively declared the country's dairy industry in crisis, calling on the European commission to give the state dispensation to help farmers struggling with the fallout from Parmalat's problems. Meanwhile, prosecutors continued to investigate events leading to the discovery of a \u20ac4bn (\u00a32.8bn) black hole in the company's accounts, amid allegations of forgery. At a cabinet meeting yesterday, ministers approved an emergency decree which would allow companies seeking to restructure to apply to the industry ministry to appoint an administrator with immediate powers to act. Under previous rules, the process could take up to 60 days. The law grants companies protection for up to two years. Industry minister Antonio Marzano defended the decision to help Parmalat. The object of the decree was \"to save jobs, not shareholders and the management\", he said. Brussels said it would like more details. Last night Parmalat's board under new chairman and chief executive Enrico Bondi was meeting to discuss the moves to seek court protection. The Parmalat scandal, which has been dubbed Europe's Enron, has hit investors and the farming community. Shareholders have seen the company's stock market value drop from \u20ac1.8bn to a fraction of that figure while farmers claim they are owed \u20ac120m in milk bills. Confagricoltura said 5,000 Italian dairy farms stood to be affected by the crisis. \"There is a risk that many dairy farms will collapse because of liquidity problems,\" the association warned on Monday night. Some farmers, many of whom have large bank debts for machinery purchases, have been keeping afloat in recent months by calling on other clients to pay for their milk in advance, to make up for missing Parmalat payments. \"It's in our interest to do this. Because if Parmalat goes it's a catastrophe for all the small producers we work with. I have known some of them for years. They have been ringing me in tears,\" said Marco Lorenzoni, director of Latte Sano, a Rome milk supplier and competitor of Parmalat. Analysts argued that if Parmalat went bankrupt a thriving sector would go down with it. \"This is not a company that could not sell its products,\" said Rome political scientist Franco Pavoncello. \"This is a huge industrial success that just went belly-up because of financial shenanigans. That is why it is worth intervening.\" Yesterday the Berlusconi government responded by saying it would ask the European commission to recognise the industry's crisis status and give it special exemption from rules on state aid to allow it to support the farmers. Questions were first raised about Parmalat's finances after the apparently cash-rich company, which spans dairy produce, beverages and bakery products, was late repaying a bond issue. Concern mounted when it was forced to admit it had been unable to withdraw almost \u20ac500m from an offshore fund but the crisis exploded when it revealed that Bank of America had invalidated a document purporting to show that a Parmalat subsidiary held $3.95bn (\u00a32.2bn) in cash and securities. The group has missed the deadlines to buy out minority shareholders in its Brazilian operations, with negotiations between the company and the other shareholders continuing. As prosecutors - who have questioned three former finance directors and its founder, Calisto Tanzi, who quit the company this month - continued their investigations, a lawyer acting for Bank of America claimed important bank documents had been falsified. A scanning machine was used to forge bank documents, according to judicial sources quoted by the Reuters news agency. Last night Bank of America said it had met Italian prosecutors, and \"filed a criminal complaint in accordance with Italian law in connection with the Parmalat investigation\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
