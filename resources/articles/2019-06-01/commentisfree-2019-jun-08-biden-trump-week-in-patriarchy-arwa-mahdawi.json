Women deserve better than Biden Congratulations to Joe Biden, who may have just set a new record for the world\u2019s fastest flip-flop. On Wednesday, Biden\u2019s campaign confirmed that the candidate still supports the Hyde amendment, which stops federal Medicaid funding being used for most abortion services. Less than 24 hours later, following intense criticism from reproductive rights groups and other Democratic candidates, Biden announced he didn\u2019t support the amendment, after all. \u201cI can\u2019t justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability ... to exercise their constitutional protected right [to abortion],\u201d Biden said at a fundraising gala on Thursday. The devout Roman Catholic explained that he\u2019d changed his longstanding position on the 43-year-old law because banning federal funding for abortion services hadn\u2019t, he believed, previously prevented low-income women from accessing the procedure. \u201cThere was sufficient monies and circumstances where women were able to exercise that right [to an abortion], women of color, poor women,\u201d Biden said. He further noted that the right to an abortion wasn\u2019t previously under attack \u201cas it is now\u201d. There is nothing wrong with politicians changing their minds; however there is a big difference between genuinely evolving your views and disingenuous flip-flopping. Biden\u2019s abrupt reversal on the Hyde amendment would seem to be the latter: women should hold out no hope that Biden will actually act on his new-found beliefs. Biden\u2019s explanation for his U-turn isn\u2019t just disingenuous \u2013 his assertion that the Hyde amendment didn\u2019t previously prevent poorer women from accessing abortion services is downright dishonest. There is a mountain of research from both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups showing that the Hyde amendment prevented huge numbers of women from accessing safe and legal abortions. Studies show that the birthrate among women on Medicaid increased by 13% after the amendment was passed, for example. And a 2016 report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion organization, asserts that since 1976 the amendment is responsible for over two million births. The Hyde amendment hasn\u2019t just compelled women to give birth against their wishes; it has killed them. Biden\u2019s blithe avowal that there were \u201csufficient monies and circumstances\u201d to help poor women access abortions in the past insults the memory of women like Rosie Jimenez, who died because they couldn\u2019t afford a safe abortion. Centrists frequently scold the left for having unreasonable exceptions of politicians, asserting that we shouldn\u2019t expect our politicians to be \u201cideologically pure\u201d. That\u2019s fair enough, but we should expect our politicians to have a functioning moral compass. We should expect them to take responsibility for their actions and apologize when they are wrong. We should expect them to take women\u2019s rights seriously. If Biden had genuinely evolved in his attitudes toward abortion he would have acknowledged the much-documented impact of the Hyde amendment and apologized for supporting it. (Particularly considering that he didn\u2019t just support the law, he repeatedly tried to prevent rape and incest exceptions from being added to it.) But Biden seems to be allergic to taking responsibility \u2013 \u201cI make no apologies for my last position,\u201d he announced on Thursday. Biden has demonstrated time and time again that he doesn\u2019t take women\u2019s rights seriously, that he doesn\u2019t take women seriously. He\u2019s declined to take any real responsibility for how he handled Anita Hill\u2019s testimony against Clarence Thomas, for example. And he\u2019s treated allegations of unwanted touching as one big joke. He presents himself as the anti-Trump but the reality is that Trump and Biden are two sides of the same misogynistic coin. Trump\u2019s disdain for women manifests itself in crass braggadocio, Biden\u2019s in patronizing paternalism. Women should cut Biden no slack just because he isn\u2019t Trump: we deserve far better. My wiiiiiiife, I love my wife It\u2019s been a big week for Internet Wife Guy analysis, with New York Magazine, the New York Times, and the New Yorker all weighing in on the phenomenon. A Wife Guy, for those who aren\u2019t Extremely Online, is someone who has crafted a personal brand by posting a lot of Wife Content. According to the Times \u201cthe identification and mocking of \u2018wife guys\u2019 evidences a mild discomfort with the tradition of marriage itself \u2026[but is also] a specific reaction to marriage in its current form, as a highly individualized pursuit in which a man may express his purest self\u201d. Japan\u2019s painful high heel debate Japan\u2019s health and labour minister, Takumi Nemoto, has said that it is \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d for women to wear high heels at work. Nemoto\u2019s remarks were in response to a campaign called #KuToo, that asks the government to ban employers from forcing professional women to wear heels. I reckon Nemoto should be forced to wear stilettos for a week and see if he still feels the same. Some morons in Boston are planning \u2018Straight Pride\u2019 The organizers aren\u2019t just attention-seeking homophobes, they\u2019ve also got worrying ties to white supremacist groups. Australian female soccer players score a pay victory There\u2019s a huge gender pay gap in professional sports, however some progress is slowly being made to fix it. On Friday, the Football Federation Australia announced that professional women soccer players will get the same base pay as men. Meanwhile, in America, the US women\u2019s national team is suing US Soccer for years of \u201cinstitutionalized gender discrimination\u201d. The quilts that made America quake I had the privilege of interviewing Faith Ringgold, a true feminist icon, recently for the Guardian. If you\u2019re in London, do go check out her new exhibition at the Serpentine. Killing the crazy cat lady We all know the \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d trope; it has stubbornly persisted for centuries. However a new book called Girls and Cats aims to modernize the stereotype, and make cat ladies cool. Sounds like the purrfect way to fight meowsogyny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
