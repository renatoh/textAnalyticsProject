The stats also favour those at the forefront of the betting (nine of the past 12 have been won by the front two in the market) and runners aged three or four (only one five-year-old and upwards has been victorious since 1988). An in-form candidate is even more of a plus (14 of the past 16 Arc winners finished first on their most recent start and the other two were only beaten a neck). The ante-post favourite, Dalakhani, is an obvious candidate having also won the Prix Niel last month, the trial with the best record of producing Arc winners. But he has a very bad draw on the wide outside, and nine of the past 10 winners were drawn in single figures. The trend in the top races this year has very much favoured older horses against the three-year-olds. So Aidan O'Brien's High Chaparral, whose only defeat since losing on his debut came in this race last year - after an interrupted preparation - when a close third, has a very solid look about him. The selection has demonstrated the necessary speed to lie handy, which is so crucial in the Arc, and has the necessary stamina to cope with the rain-softened ground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
