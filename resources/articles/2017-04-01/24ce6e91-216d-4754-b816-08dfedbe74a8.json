The rightwing provocateur was invited by campus Republicans to speak on 27 April about illegal immigration. In a letter to Berkeley College Republicans sent on Tuesday, vice-chancellor Scott Biddy said officials made the decision in consultation with campus police who determined they could not ensure the safety of Coulter, audience members or protesters expected at the event. \u201cGiven current active security threats, it is not possible to assure that the event could be held successfully,\u201d the letter said. Coulter fired off an angry stream of tweets on Wednesday vowing to speak as planned. Later on Wednesday, Coulter said in an interview with Fox News: \u201cWhat are they going to do? Arrest me? I\u2019m definitely giving the speech.\u201d University spokesman Dan Mogulof said that campus police learned that some of the groups that appeared to be responsible for the violence last weekend and at an earlier Milo Yiannopoulos event \u201cplanned to target the appearance of Ann Coulter on campus\u201d. Far-right and far-left protesters clashed violently on Saturday at a rally supporting Donald Trump in downtown Berkeley, and in February an appearance at UC Berkeley by Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart editor, was canceled after protesters rioted outside the event. Last week, posters went up on campus threatening disruption of the Coulter event and officials also found chatter on various websites indicating the possibility of planned violence, Mogulof said. In its letter, the university said the students and officials could work together to reschedule the event for a later date. It noted that \u201cmost Mondays and Tuesdays in September during the day should work\u201d. Coulter posted eight tweets in a span of 17 minutes after reports of the cancellation surfaced Wednesday. She called claims of the university trying to set up an alternate date \u201cFAKE NEWS!\u201d The event was being co-organized by a campus group called BridgeCal and the Young America\u2019s Foundation, a conservative group that books Coulter\u2019s campus speeches. \u201cWe have no intention of acceding to these unconstitutional acts,\u201d the Young America\u2019s Foundation said in a statement. \u201cThe Ann Coulter lecture \u2026. will go forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
