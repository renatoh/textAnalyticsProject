Des Browne, the defence secretary, having been nagged, cajoled and hectored, finally admitted to \"a degree of regret that can be equated with an apology\". Pressed to use the word \"sorry\", he said, grudgingly: \"If you want me to say 'sorry', then I am happy to say 'sorry'.\" He said it in a very loud voice, which made it sound even less rueful. I don't suppose many parents would think that was quite enough. \"Have you said 'sorry' to your sister for throwing her dolls out of the window, young man?\" \"I have expressed a degree of regret that can be equated with an apology.\" \"You will say sorry to her, or you will not be playing football this afternoon!\" \"Oh, all right, sorr-ee.\" It was a magnificently evasive performance. The Tories thought that, this time, they must have got him. But he slipped through their fingers, hurled himself over the side, and was last seen swimming frantically for the safety of the shore. Now, he did admit that he had got some things wrong over allowing the 15 prisoners to sell their stories to the papers. But it was a professional politician's admission of guilt - in other words it was barely an admission of anything. On Maundy Thursday he had received \"a note\" from the navy HQ in Portsmouth telling him that it would be \"impractical\" to stop the payments going through. \"I accept that in retrospect I should have rejected the note and overruled the decision.\" \"In retrospect\" means \"anyone else would have made the same mistake at the time.\" \"I should have foreseen that this attempt by the navy in good faith to handle an exceptional situation ...\" means \"nobody has had to face anything like this before. How was I supposed to know what to do, for heaven's sake?\" Then: \"Let me be clear with the house: I made a mistake. I have been completely open about that.\" (Or, \"unlike you lot, I am honest enough to say so.\") \"And to the extent that what happened has caused people to question the hard-won reputation of the armed forces, that is something I profoundly regret - but I remind people that precisely because this reputation is hard-won, it is not easily undermined.\" This I took to mean, \"do you seriously imagine that the victors of Agincourt, Trafalgar and Alamein could be affected by anything I might do or say?\" But Mr Browne was even more subtle. He almost always referred to the 15 prisoners as \"young people\", a term he used at least a dozen times, as in \"these young people, exposed to such newsworthy events\". Or \"wars\" as we used to call them. Naturally this makes them seem like vulnerable folk who could not be expected to behave like adults, even adults armed with guns. I wondered how Tennyson would have immortalised the event. \"All in the valley of death/Rode the young people ... editors to the right of them/Snappers to the left of them ...\" Journey's End would have been a very different play. \"I say, everyone, we're going over the top tonight, and the good news is, it's alcopops all round if we breach the German lines!\" The result of all this was that the only person to lay a glove on him - the Tories were, as ever, quite hopeless - was a Labour MP, Kate Hoey. She welcomed his apology. \"But if he has made a mistake, what mistake does it take for him to consider whether he should offer his resignation?\" Mr Browne declined to declare just how many more mistakes he needed to make before offering to go. Instead, he felt we should consider the \"young people\". It was not a reply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
