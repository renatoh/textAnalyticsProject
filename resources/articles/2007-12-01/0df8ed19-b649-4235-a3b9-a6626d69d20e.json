He was charged with making an untrue statement to procure a passport and obtaining a money transfer by deception in relation to life insurance. In Florida, where she is believed to be staying, Anne Darwin was making preparations to fly back to the UK where she faces almost certain arrest. Detective Sergeant Iain Henderson, of Cleveland police, said Darwin will remain in police custody until tomorrow, when an application will be made at Hartlepool magistrates' court to remand him in custody. 'Inquiries are still ongoing and, as legal procedures are now active, we cannot give any further information,' Henderson said. He urged Anne Darwin to contact police at the earliest opportunity, adding that if she does not, police will make inquiries to trace her. He added: 'There have been lots of people in touch with the inquiry and we're pursuing these calls and contacts.' The Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) has also been drafted in to investigate the couple. Detectives from Soca are believed to be in Panama, following their financial trail. Last night a spokesman confirmed Soca was involved in 'international liaisons' concerning the couple. Officers are investigating how John Darwin allegedly acquired a false identity to get a passport. Meanwhile, work on piecing together John Darwin's movements over the past five years continued, with officers examining several dozen calls and 32 emails to a special hotline. He disappeared from the couple's home in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, in March 2002 and was presumed drowned after his wrecked canoe was found. Then, eight days ago, he walked into a London police station, claiming that he had no recollection of the intervening years. He was arrested last Tuesday. Reports yesterday suggested his initial account to police of his disappearance appeared to differ from his wife's version of events. In a series of extraordinary reports concerning her husband's missing five years, Anne Darwin has claimed he planned his disappearance to escape debts and that she claimed the life insurance money after he returned. Her husband's aunt, Margaret Burns, 80, yesterday also spoke of the bizarre turn of events. 'It's beyond satire,' she said. 'You couldn't make it up.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
