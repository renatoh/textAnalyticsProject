It's not a question that's going to endear me to some of our regulars, but I pose it in the spirit of no-holds-barred inquiry. Since it's so often trotted out as a self-evident evil, we should at least consider whether it really is as bad as we think. The Guardian has published a story about plans by the Church of England to introduce a new generation to its brand of Christianity, in particular by reaching out to younger children. The response from readers was varied, though broadly hostile. What upset a lot people was the idea that a religious group should set about \"indoctrinating\" children who were intellectually defenceless \u2013 the implicit fear being that youngsters would swallow it whole, and end up as slavish Christians, without their properly informed consent. To unpick this, we should probably take a look at what we mean by \"indoctrinate\". The OED definition is \"to imbue with a doctrine, idea or opinion\". Now, while to imbue someone with an idea could be quite an innocent activity, to convince them of the worth of your opinions is a more partisan one: you could do this for evil, or to misguide. To work to instil a doctrine \u2013 a rigid ideology \u2013 could be a step still further away from the interests of the student. It could be. It could also work very well for them. The 12-step programme is, after all, a doctrine, and can be life-saving. When it comes to the teaching of religion, it's clear that the dictionary definition of indoctrination applies. (Not so clear, incidentally, in the case of the Church of England's plans: \"We would endorse ways of interesting children in the Christian faith and the Christian story,\" says Janina Ainsworth. Is \"endorsing ways of interesting children\" the same as \"imbuing\"?) Teaching young people that Jesus is the saviour of mankind is clearly imparting a particular and contentious doctrine to them. But just how damaging is this, even if they swallow it hook, line and sinker? There are a few arguments I can think of, but I'm not completely convinced by them (as always, I'm open to persuasion). The main one is that children do not yet have the capacity to evaluate the worth of religious ideas. Fine. This envisages two possible outcomes: the first, that they spend a few years blithely believing something that they later come to regard as nonsense, or irrelevant, or merely interesting but untrue. The second, that they spend a a lifetime believing it. But in which case is the person really damaged by the experience? There are of course examples of children that grow up in very strict sects whose doctrine persuades their parents to treat them severely, or to reject aspects of their identity. But plenty of people are raised in less-than-compassionate environments, religious or otherwise, and they escape them. The fact that they do can even give their adult life greater meaning. Of course, for many, the idea that anyone should spend their whole lives believing something wrong is bad. Those who are convinced of the truth of Christianity, whether they suffer or not, have been convinced of a lie, so the argument goes. But why single out religion? Lots of people believe lots of things that are probably wrong: they cleave to political and social hypotheses whose benefits are hotly contested, and sometimes impossible to test. Most of our working models of the world are based on a very fallible combination of imagination and experience, not scientific truth. I suppose the trickiest argument to dismiss is the one that goes: \"Let them believe what they want, so long as they don't do any harm. But religious doctrine can do great harm: what about the Catholic refusal to endorse condoms in the fight against Aids, or Islamist terrorism?\" To this I would say: you don't need religion to be evil. For every Mohamed Atta, there are 100 million Muslim children, indoctrinated in more or less the same way, who don't grow up to be terrorists. And lots of Catholics aren't comfortable with official teaching on contraception, but make up their own minds. In any case, I'm not trying to defend a particular religious ideology \u2013 merely to ask, is the charge of \"indoctrination\" really among the worst you can throw at organised religion?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
