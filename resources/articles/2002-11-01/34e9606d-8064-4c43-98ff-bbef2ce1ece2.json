That, however, is no reason for France to send him to the guillotine. The call for Fifa to ban Anelka from playing for Manchester City this weekend because he refuses to turn out for the national side is absurd and unjust. Recalled to the French colours at the weekend in place of the injured Sidney Govou, Anelka turned down the invitation to join them in preparation for tonight's friendly against Yugoslavia in Paris. Instead of informing Jacques Santini, the head coach, he chose to announce his decision through the press. This was not a display of good manners but it was not meant to be. As he saw it, Anelka was responding in kind to persistent ill treatment. The problem goes back five years, to an under-20 tournament in which G\u00e9rard Houllier blamed Anelka and Thierry Henry for France's elimination. Lest anyone thought that Anelka was the type to let bygones be bygones, he spoke of the incident last week when defending Steven Gerrard against Houllier's recent criticisms. In 1998 he was left out of Aim\u00e9 Jacquet's squad, which went on to win the World Cup. While the final was in progress he was sitting on the London-bound Eurostar, no doubt thinking that France would have won the tournament with a greater flourish had he been present. A few months later he got his chance and profited from Zinedine Zidane's passes to send England to a 2-0 home defeat. But for a mistaken offside decision, he would have become only the third man in history to score a hat-trick against England at Wembley. The disruption caused by his controversial moves from Arsenal to Real Madrid and thence to Paris St-Germain cost him his place in the Euro 2000 side and another medal. By the time Houllier summoned him to Anfield last December it was too late for him to stake a successful claim to a berth in the 2002 World Cup squad. Those who watched him in a Liverpool shirt last season were impressed by his application and his unselfish ness. Someone who does not smile easily, he took evident pleasure in making and scoring goals alongside Michael Owen and Emile Heskey. The reason Houllier did not make the loan deal more lasting was that he did not want to deal with Anelka's brothers, Didier and Claude, who allegedly made an approach to Arsenal soon after Nicolas's arrival at Anfield. Kevin Keegan was the next to accept the challenge and so far he has received a wonderful reward for his \u00a313m investment. Anelka's goals, his partnership with Shaun Goater and the all-round development of his game have made him as significant a figure in City's fight to consolidate their position in the Premiership as Ali Benarbia was in last year's promotion campaign. But still he does not convince the French. \"Does he see himself sharing Cantona's destiny?\" Vincent Deluc asked in L'Equipe yesterday. \"There's a big difference. France needed Cantona in the early 90s. It doesn't really need Anelka today. He has made little progress since he left Arsenal in 1999, and he's clearly been overtaken by other forwards of his generation, not just Henry and Trezeguet but also Wiltord. Nor would it be scandalous to suggest that Govou and Marlet bring more to the team at this moment than Anelka.\" The man from L'Equipe and, presumably, Santini can believe that if they want to. Some of us, however, have seen enough of Anelka and Marlet to know the difference between a world-class striker and a useful journeyman. As for Anelka's behaviour, at least it has the virtue of consistency. Brought up in Plain de Nauphle, a new town south of Paris, where immigrants from the Antilles, Indo-China and the Maghreb eke out their lives in apartment blocks that may be named after Camus, Gaugin, Stendhal and Van Gogh but are plagued by unemployment and petty crime, he has no time for what he sees as the hypocrisy of the straight world. Shy, intelligent, suspicious, thoughtful, he was given an early lesson in the value of loyalty at the age of 16, when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger encouraged him to leave PSG and join a club that later made \u00a321m profit on the deal. Now his heart tells him to resist commodification while his head tells him to exploit it. However confused and self-destructive it may be, Nicolas Anelka's latest outburst is in reality a form of social criticism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
