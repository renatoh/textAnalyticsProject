The figures showed that the rapid tests identified just five out of 10 positive cases which had been detected by standard coronavirus tests, and seven out of 10 of those with high quantities of the virus. The rapid tests, also known as lateral flow tests, provide much quicker results than standard tests. This speed has led to their use in care homes to allow family members to visit, and in universities to allow students to return home for Christmas. Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, called for an end to the use of rapid tests in universities and care homes, saying that they gave \u201cfalse reassurance\u201d. \u201cMass testing should be stopped, and sensible advice about symptoms and contact tracing should be given to students,\u201d she said. \u201cThe lateral flow tests aren\u2019t designed to be used on healthy symptomless people in the community, it says this in the information sheets from the manufacturers.\u201d Pollock also criticised the government for \u201cburying\u201d the statistics in a wider document on community testing. The statistics are mentioned in just one sentence in an 8,000-word government document on community testing. \u201cWhat\u2019s really worrying is that the government still hasn\u2019t published the evaluation of the mass testing in Liverpool bearing some of the key findings around the high proportion of false negatives so they\u2019ve tucked away this extraordinary statement in the appendix,\u201d she said. Prof Jon Deeks of the University of Birmingham said the mass use of the rapid tests was \u201cputting people at risk\u201d. \u201cIt is not the case that if you have a negative result from the tests, you don\u2019t have Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything says you should confirm them with the PCR tests.\u201d The polymerase chain reaction swab test which is widely used in the UK is seen as the gold standard for detecting the virus but results take longer. Dr Sian Taylor-Phillips, professor of population health at the University of Warwick, said she was most concerned that care homes \u201ccould be letting infectious people in\u201d. \u201cMy concern across all of the settings is whether we\u2019re being honest with people that they could still be infectious, and that we\u2019re not being fair not knowing that they\u2019re putting their relatives at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is an urgent need for a proper report on the results from Liverpool,\u201d she added. Prof Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is a member of Independent Sage, said that he would be \u201cvery cautious about their use in care homes\u201d, insisting that \u201cnobody should rely on a single test\u201d. However, he said that the rapid tests could be effective in certain circumstances. \u201cWith PCR tests, it can take several days from deciding to get a test to getting the results, and if people aren\u2019t isolating in between, it is better to have a less sensitive test that is much faster. But the ideal thing is to have faster PCR testing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rapid tests do have a role, but it has to be the right role.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe country\u2019s leading scientists have rigorously evaluated and confirmed the accuracy of the tests for asymptomatic testing. \u201cWith up to a third of individuals with Covid-19 not displaying symptoms, broadening testing to identify those showing no symptoms and who can infect people unknowingly will mean finding positive cases more quickly and break chains of transmission.\u201d A Liverpool city council spokesperson said that those who had been given a rapid test had also been offered a confirmatory PCR test, and that other safeguards were in place in the city\u2019s care home testing pilot, including the wearing of PPE and a ban on touching others. \u201cThis has always been a pilot, not only to identify where the virus is in the city, but also to learn about different testing technologies and different testing strategies,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe University of Liverpool and national public health agencies are working with us to evaluate how best to use the tests, and we are taking a careful approach with extra safeguards in place.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
