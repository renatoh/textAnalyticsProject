Now, sure enough, the BBC has been forced to tear up a 10-year agreement to sell its BBC for Business unit to a US-based company. BBC for Business, which makes training videos and CD-roms and has an annual turnover of around \u00a32m, was sold to Ed Guinan's Knowledge Chase. When the deal was unveiled in December, Worldwide boasted it would earn \"a multimillion pound figure\" from the BBC for Business sale and subsequent royalty payments. Now it is being forced to take the business back in house. The reverse is a major embarrassment for BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, and the director general, Greg Dyke, who has set great store by raising extra money for BBC programmes from commercial ventures. Mr Guinan lasted just two months at his previous firm, the internet investment firm Jellyworks and makes no secret of the fact that several of his past enterprises have failed. \"We have terminated our agreement with them,\" a BBC Worldwide spokeswoman confirmed. \"The deal was in two stages,\" she added. \"The first involved a substantial payment to Worldwide and an equity stake. But Knowledge Chase has not been able to secure the money to fund the second payment.\" The BBC is understood to have received more than \u00a31m as an initial payment from Knowledge Chase. The licence for the BBC for Business brand and products reverted to the BBC on Monday and the outfit is still trading, the spokeswoman said. Worldwide is now in the \"advanced stages\" of negotiating with Knowledge Chase over a proposal for the BBC to take back operational control of the business, she added. The BBC will accept liability for BBC for Business staff - who number less than 10 - as part of proposal. Some of the BBC for Business employees are understood not to have been paid by Knowledge Chase this month.
