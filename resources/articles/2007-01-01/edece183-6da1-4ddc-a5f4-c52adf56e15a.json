And while the Gene Kelly/Debbie Reynolds romance is airy-light, there's a hard satirical edge to the portrayals of the tough-nut studio bosses wrestling with the arrival of sound. Probably Kelly's finest hour, too, with his giddy, lovestruck pitter-patter through the puddles. King Kong 7pm, Sky Movies 2 (Peter Jackson, 2005) This remake of Merian C Cooper's 1933 classic was a long-cherished ambition of Peter \"Lord of the Rings\" Jackson. At nearly three hours it's too long, but a breathtaking action-adventure none the less, with Jack Black's hard-up director enticing penniless dancer Naomi Watts to Skull Island to make a movie, where they find a bigger co-star than they expected. Amid the awesome set-pieces a poignant relationship develops between the monster and the showgirl. Saturday Night Fever 11pm, 2.50am, Sky Cinema 2 (John Badham, 1977) John Travolta struts his Bee Gees stuff in the role that Quentin Tarantino held dear when reinventing Travolta-as-screen-icon in Pulp Fiction: his Tony Manero, shop assistant by day, disco king by night, crackles with energy, his likable persona disguising the laddism of his friends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
