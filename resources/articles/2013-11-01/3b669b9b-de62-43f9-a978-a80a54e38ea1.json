The deal is reward for Berahino's stunning emergence this season, with the 20-year-old scoring six goals for Albion and six in four appearances for England Under-21s. Talks between Berahino's representatives and Albion have been continuing for a couple of months but the parties are on the verge of an agreement and an announcement could be made before the end of the week. Berahino, who was born in Burundi and has come through Albion's academy, first came to prominence when he scored a hat-trick on his full Albion debut in the Capital One Cup tie against Newport County in August. That landmark was followed by a goal against Arsenal in the same competition the following month and the winner in the 2-1 Premier League victory at Manchester United three days later. Berahino's other Albion goal came in the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at the start of this month. There was speculation that Roy Hodgson was considering calling Berahino into the full squad for the friendlies with Chile and Germany, although Steve Clarke, Albion's head coach, felt that the England manager was right to keep the forward in the Under-21s setup. Berahino responded by scoring twice in the 3-0 win over Finland last Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
