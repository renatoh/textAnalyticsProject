Several emails, complete with ironic snort-cum-laugh opener, clogged up the Knowledge mailbox within seconds. Obviously, cried Paul Gorman, 'the Old Firm - like most clubs that share a city - don't play their home matches on the same day'. This, says James Connelly, is down to safety reasons (namely that it is unsafe to have more than 100,000 drunken Celtic and Rangers fans stumbling through Glasgow on a Saturday afternoon with less than 2,000 policemen to keep them in check). So this Ken Dodd on a wet winter Monday scenario of yours, Tom, is a hard one to uncover - not least because the two sides have an uncanny knack of winning all the time - especially when they're in Glasgae. That said, we can reveal that way back when Glenn Hoddle's name was still on Spurs fans' shirts without 'We 8' above it, the Gers and the Bhoys both lost. Yes, you read it right, on Wednesday August 22nd 2001, both teams met their match in the European Cup (you didn't really think such a cataclysmic event would have happened in the Scottish Premier League did you? Did you?). Rangers travelled to Fenerbahce's Sukru Saracoglu only to lose 2-1, while Celtic played hosts to Ajax, who strode out 1-0 winners. Now, Ibrox may have sat empty that night, but it's probably a safe bet that Ken Dodd's gig the next night would have gone down like a Diddy Men basketball team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
