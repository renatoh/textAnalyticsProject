Now, it's mainly about being on TV. There can't be a squad car in the country without a camera mounted in the front, pointing at the driver's seat, so that we at home can share the excitement of the chase, usually accompanied by a Grand Theft Auto-style soundtrack. I've always quite enjoyed these shows \u2013 Police Camera Action, Cops With Cameras, Pig Brother, etc. I like the extraordinary English that police officers use (I mean, avail themselves of), because that's the rule: don't use a simple word when there's a more complicated and convoluted alternative. Even when you think there is only one simple word for something \u2013 left, say, or right \u2013 they get round it by saying it twice. He's turned left left into Acacia Avenue. No wonder there's so much paperwork. There's plenty of left-lefting in Car Crime UK (ITV1). And that other thing the police are good at: talking to adult members of the public as if they're children. \"What's your name?\" says an officer to a man who's just been blocked in by four police cars, pulled out of his car, and wrestled to the ground. \"Baio,\" says the man, face-down in the road. \"Baio of stolen car-o?\" says one officer, and his colleagues chuckle. Ha ha ha, funny foreign name, let's do a joke about it. They must do these shows because they think they make them look good, but I think there's room for improvement in some areas. Possibly in the actual policing as well. PCs Nathan Gulum and Gareth Mason come across a stolen silver Renault Megane at KFC \u2013 not because they' ve done any detective work to find it, it's just a coincidence: a couple who stopped off for a six-piece bargain bucket recognised their own stolen number plates on the Megane. It shouldn't be too hard to apprehend the driver, who hasn't seen them \u2013 he's queuing at the drive-thru, surely they can just sneak up and get him . . . No, PC Gulum manages to smash the car's window, but the hooded driver simply floors it, straight over the mini-roundabout, then right right and away. Bungled job. Later, Trevor McDonald, who's narrating, says: \"The good news is that another unit has found the car, it's been abandoned, the suspect has fled.\" That's good news, that the criminal got away? Next, Sergeant Torkington and PC Mason are chasing a Golf GTi full of hooded youths. The youths pull over, three get out and run for it, Sgt Torkington and PC Mason give chase on foot, and the two hoodies still in the Golf drive off. All five of them get away. \"Fortun-ately, another unit is close by and on the lookout for the vehicle,\" says Sir Trevor, who seems to see the bright side of every situation. Things are not an awful lot more impressive on Send in the Dogs (ITV1, of course, because one 60-minute programme following police around the Greater Manchester area is not enough for one evening; we need two, in a row). PC Greaves and his german shepherd, Riley, are pursuing a suspect across some wasteland. They spot him, by the tram tracks, but Riley can't be let off the lead here \u2013 it's too dangerous, apparently. All dogs must be kept on leads. And the criminal remains firmly on the loose. A tram turns up, the suspect gets on, the tram leaves. \"I'm not allowed on the tram with my dog,\" says PC Greaves, sadly. No dogs allowed, expect guide dogs. Another German shepherd called Leo does manage to be around when a suspected car-thief is apprehended in a wheelie bin. But, to be fair, it was the police helicopter with the thermal-imaging cameras, not Leo, that knew he was in there. Leo barks a lot, though, which adds to the drama of the occasion. Woof woof. See? Even the police dogs do it: one woof would have been sufficient to make the point. If ITV1 is where the cop-chase belongs, then Five is home to massive-engineering-project television \u2014 Big, Bigger, Biggest, for example. Impressive statistics, crude graphics, metallic sound effects: come on, I'm a boy, I love them. This one, though, about the drilling of the Gotthard Base tunnel under the Alps, the longest in the world, is obviously just one big bore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
