Cor blimey guv'nor, etc! Didn't you just love it? A thriller if ever this email round-up has seen one. Game of the century, perhaps. Have you ever had the pleasure of watching better football in your life? Well yes, actually. Some of you have. \"A thriller? How can anyone call a tie that is effectively over after 12 minutes a thriller?\" says less-than-thrilled Dr Paul Smith. \"A couple of comedy goals made it look far better than it really was.\" Twelve minutes, did you say Dr Paul? \"I cannot believe all the fuss about last night. It was all but over after 12 minutes,\" confirms Phil Roebuck who was also using his egg-timer. \"It turned into a non competitive training ground kick-about after Ronaldo's second. For me, it wasn't even game of the month, never mind 'game of the century'. Arsenal v Man Utd was a much more gripping encounter.\" \"People are kidding themselves,\" agrees Shervin Moghaddam. \"Real were 3-2 up and coasting when they took off Ronaldo and Figo off to save them for the weekend fixture. Let's face it, it was a cakewalk.\" Well, you ingrates, at least some people enjoyed. Welcome to the forum Bob Carrington, all the way from Brazil. \"Praise be for cable TV!\" he says. \"If it hadn't been for the likes of ESPN, I would not have been able to witness one of the greatest football matches of all time, live from my armchair in the hinterland of Brazil. The acres left open by the United defence last night must have been like manna from heaven to Ronaldo! And to use a well-worn clich\u00e9,\" what, another one, Bob? \"watching Real is really like watching poetry in motion.\" Chi enjoyed it for less heart-warming reasons. \"Even being a lifelong supporter of a currently under-achieving Liverpool, I just love the early spring months!\" he/she says. \"Guaranteed year on year we will see the self-proclaimed biggest club in the world fail where it counts.\" Hmm, can you see where United fans might have a counter-argument here, Chi? Tayo Papoola is also revelling in United's misery. \"The best moment was hearing that Manc-supporting buffoon Clive Tyldsley's voice actually choke with emotion when Madrid's second goal went in,\" he/she says. \"'Heart breaker,' he said. 'Hysterical!' the rest of us giggled.\" Conal Presho was one of those gigglers. \"The best part of the game had to be David Beckham sitting on the bench attempting to look mean and moody. No mean feat in an Alice Band!\" Talking of David Beckham, and we were, someone whose name I have sadly misplaced has this to say: \"Speaking to the few knowledgeable United fans I know they all feel the team is better without Beckham and I for one agree,\" he/she says. \"Look at their most impressive performances this season - Newcastle, Arsenal, etc. - they have all been either when Beckham was on the bench or not available and that's a fact.\" A fact! Eric from Bournemouth supports our anonymous emailer's assertion. \"Surely United's sentence came when Beckham's second free-kick hit the back frame of the goal,\" says Eric. \"Beckham showed lack of maturity and over-enthusiasm in himself. With some set-piece trickery, creativity and teamwork Ferguson's men might have been able to really test Real's defence and who knows what might have happened then?\" \"Sir Alex must be praying for Real to cough up the \u00a338m for Becks,\" says a clearly biased Muhammed Riaz Gani. \"I am a Barcelona fan so you cannot accuse me of any bias, I call it how I see it,\" he adds. Oh. Onward we go. Kevin Dawson, the floor is yours: \"The absence of Scholes was of far more significance than Beckham's presence on the bench,\" he says. \"Beckham has been so peripheral in so many games - big and small - that Ferguson was absolutely right not to start him.\" All this criticism of a man who scored two (well, one-and-a-half) goals! What about the others? Rio Ferd... \"Ferdinand is clearly not worth all his money,\" interjects Nicholas Deltort, showing the kind of anticipation he wishes he could see in Rio. \"He has a lot to learn tactically and especially about his game without the ball, his placement and sense of anticipation.\" \"Poor Rio was as embarrassed as I've ever seen a defender be,\" says Ivor Irwin. \"No more comparisons with Franco Baresi, please. He's got all the muscle, skills and tools, but nothing in the noggin. Rio is no longer a boy and last night all his weaknesses showed.\" Strong words indeed. The kind that a certain Roy Keane might once have used, before he turned into a pussycat. \"Roy Keane is definitely no longer a force to be reckoned with,\" says Gareth J Ledbetter. \"Just after he was subbed there was a close-up: I saw it etched into the lines of his sensual Cork features: 'Up ye bollix, Oi should quit.'\" John McLaughlin asks himself a question: \"The most telling visual image?\" Then he answers it: \"The sight of Brown, Silvestre and Ferdinand walking, mouths open and all in a row, back towards their own goal, having completely lost the three Real players queuing up to put the second past Barthez. Does John O'Shea have brothers and sisters?\" You all like John O'Shea - even if the name of the back of his shirt was misspelled until he changed it. \"On an evening littered with a galaxy of global stars the performance of one young man stood out again,\" says Graeme Paterson, teasing us by not giving his name immediately. \"John O'Shea is a pivotal component of Man Utd's future. Whether he replaces Keane or Ferdinand or Barthez or all three, this boy is polished. He nutmegged Figo!\" he adds excitedly. \"I could playback that moment for some time to come.\" \"I thought John O'Shea was class. At his age and against the best team in the world I thought he showed self belief and a lack of fear that some more experienced members of United's team were guilty of.\" Those words were all Darren Cleveland's. Yeah, yeah, but United still crashed out. And many of you are bravely giving Sir Alex Fergie some of his own hairdryer treatment. \"Fergie must go,\" begins Atilla, having first cleared the room of any stray football boots. \"As it stood, United had a slim chance to get through. That slim chance was crudely ripped away by the manager whose arrogance is surely approaching one universally hated figure: Louis van Gaal. \"He did it at the expense of the only player who can look into the eye of the likes of Ronaldo the Kid, Zidane the Magnifique, Figo the Dark Wizard, and Roberto Carlos the Beast, as an equal: David Spice Boy Beckham.\" Right-oh. Atilla has some support. And it comes in the form of Roger Shoreman, a lifelong United supporter. \"It is clearly time for David Beckham to move on to a club that will appreciate his creativity and work ethic,\" he says. \"Ferguson's approach to this great player illustrates the fact that his retirement last season should have been enforced upon him by the club.\" Ashley Slater likes Del-boy better than Fergie as the following comparison of the two managerial giants makes all too obvious. \"Ferguson thinks he is Manchester United; Del Bosque knows he is a mere employee,\" he begins. \"Ferguson mouths off at every opportunity - Uefa is corrupt, the referees might be influenced etc - while Del Bosque quietly lets his team do the talking. Ferguson dictates everything - coaching, tactics, players, formations - whereas Del Bosque lets his players dictate where it counts, on the field.\" Alasdair Carmichael interrupts to give his tupp'orth on tactics. \"The most telling point in the game was when Ferguson put the team sheet up,\" he says. \"When chasing a two-goal deficit how can you rationalise playing a lone striker?\" \"Even though [Guardian Unlimited Spanish correspondent] Sid Lowe was joking, the untried tactic of starting Giggs and Beckham on opposite wings was surely something to give a go...Giggs' pace against Carlos and in-swinging Beckham crosses...?\" adds Paul Smith. Not the same Paul Smith as before. This one's not a doctor. Still on tactics, but linking seamlessly to our next subject of discussion, Steve McMananam, Tom says this: \"Ferguson's (spiteful) comment about McManaman probably shows more about Del Bosque's tactical awareness over his rival than any comment on the player...more's the pity for Ferguson. The fact that Ferguson spent hours wondering what formation Real would play without every considering the talents of a proven McManaman perhaps explains why Real started so brightly with their 'unusual' formation and got the noses so far in front that - no matter what anyone says - the tie result was never in doubt.\" If you're a friend of Macca, look away now. \"We were whupped good and proper by a fabulous team,\" Bex begins, harmlessly enough. But read on, readers. \"Fabulous apart from that smug, self-regarding Scouse show-off MacManaman. Like the scrawny kid picked for a playground game who has the good fortune to find himself on the side of the big lads, Macca saunters around the pitch waiting to be gifted another perfect pass that even he can't mess up. Keep playing those triangles, Stevey boy, and remember that in true Scouse tradition, you abandoned your roots and the hard work that could have made Liverpool real winners, to rake in the cash as an inconsistent bit- part performer who wouldn't be missed by Real if you dropped off the face of the earth. \"Take note, Beckham - you're just a Pepsi pony to the Madridistas, and if you think they'll let you play in the middle of the park at the Bernabeu, tell it to Zizou.\" Andrew McInnes redresses the balance. \"As a Toffee, it may seem strange but I have nothing but respect for Steve McManaman,\" he admits. \"He has always been a great player in my eyes. I am proud that he has made his way in the world, sampled another culture and been successful. Well done Stevie Mac, and what I wouldn't do to be in your shoes. See you in the summer at Goodison!\" Steve Potts tips the balance in Macca's favour. He says: \"I felt that the majority of United players, especially the British ones, looked scared of having possession, when they got the ball their touch was lacking. Which English player looked most comfortable on the ball? McManaman. Which English player put in a very composed performance on the LEFT of midfield? McManaman.\" Andrew Baines slugs back to even things up, 2-2. \"Fergie's jibe is completely justified,\" he says. \"The Scouse poseur's contribution to any of Real's victories is negligible and even he should be embarrassed that he takes money from Real under false pretences. I loathe people who bask in the glory of others success and claim it as their own.\" This, from a Man United fan!
