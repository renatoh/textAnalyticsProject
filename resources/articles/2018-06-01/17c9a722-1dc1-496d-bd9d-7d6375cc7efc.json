Mattis was speaking to reporters amid confusion over the diplomatic follow-up to last week\u2019s summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Immediately after the meeting Trump claimed that North Korea had begun the destruction of a missile engine testing site or would begin as soon as Kim returned from the summit. In return Trump ordered the suspension of military exercises with South Korea, a longstanding demand of the Pyongyang regime. This week the Pentagon confirmed that planning for the next scheduled exercises in August had halted. However, asked on Wednesday if he could \u201cput his finger on\u201d any steps North Korea had taken to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme, Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not aware of that.\u201d He added: \u201cThe detailed negotiations have not begun. I wouldn\u2019t expect that at this point.\u201d After the Singapore meeting Trump said that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and national security adviser, John Bolton, would take part in follow-up meetings with North Korean officials this week to \u201cgo into the details\u201d of the denuclearisation agreement the president believed he had struck with Kim. Both Trump and Pompeo predicted that follow-on talks with North Korean officials would take place in the week after the 12 June summit. \u201cWe\u2019re getting together next week to go into the details,\u201d Trump told a post-summit press conference in Singapore. \u201cNext week, with John Bolton and our entire team, to go over the details and to get this stuff done.\u201d The next day Pompeo confirmed: \u201cI will be the person who takes the role of driving this process forward. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what the timing will be for our next conversation with North Korea,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cI would anticipate it will be fairly quickly after we return to our home countries. I don\u2019t know exactly what form that will take but I\u2019m very confident that by some time in the next week or so we will begin the engagement.\u201d That engagement has not, so far, occurred. The state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday that although the US had been in touch with Pyongyang there was nothing to announce on Pompeo\u2019s travel plans. Bolton said on Wednesday that \u201cPompeo and others\u201d would be meeting North Korean counterparts, adding \u201cwe\u2019ll find out soon enough whether they\u2019ve made this strategic decision\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve said they want complete denuclearisation and now we\u2019ll have to talk about how to achieve that and I think you will see diplomatic engagement proceed very quickly,\u201d Bolton told Fox News, but gave no details on timing. \u201cI think there is a mad scramble right now,\u201d said Victor Cha, former director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council. He said US officials had tried and failed to persuade the North Koreans to include language in the joint statement in Singapore committing to \u201ccomplete, verifiable and irreversible\u201d disarmament with a timetable for carrying it out by 2020. \u201cThey did not get those but Trump went along with the meeting anyway, which means he cared more about the meeting than about the substance,\u201d Cha said. \u201cEven though there is no timeline, there is a de facto one now. Pompeo has to get something before August to justify suspending the [military] exercises.\u201d Another element of the Singapore joint statement was a North Korean promise to hand over remains of US soldiers, marines and airmen still unaccounted for since the 1950-53 Korean war. It said that those remains that Pyongyang has already identified as US servicemen, thought be number about 200, would be repatriated at once. \u201cThey\u2019re giving a commitment, they\u2019re starting it immediately, to recover their remains,\u201d Trump said. Recovery and repatriation has been happening on and off for decades. So far the remains of 334 servicemen have been identified from the bones and personal effects handed over by Pyongyang, and about 5,000 more are thought to be scattered around North Korean territory. US military officials said on Wednesday that the UN Command, the US-led coalition that fought the war, was planning to oversee the repatriation of more remains which could happen in the next few days. Mattis said the details had yet to be agreed. \u201cThose discussions are also ongoing right now, but I don\u2019t have any updates for you,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI know that we\u2019re engaged on it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
