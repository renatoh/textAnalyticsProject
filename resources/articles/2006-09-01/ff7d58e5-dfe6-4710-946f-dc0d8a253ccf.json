Jim Thompson Cambridge Bernard Gallacher It is the first time in a long while that the US have not been favourites, certainly - or they haven't been with the bookmakers, at least. But I don't think there can ever be favourites in Ryder Cups, because every player is vulnerable over 18 holes in that environment. Both sides, all the players, start even every time. Why do European teams appear to have more team spirit, enabling \"inferior\" players to raise their game while top-ranked US players have often underperformed? Phil Steadman Kentish Town I think to understand the European team spirit you have to understand the European tour. On the tour, players travel round together, they take the same planes to the same venue, and they even do that when the tour goes to South Africa or China, as it does now. There is a natural camaraderie that grows around that kind of schedule. How can a Ryder Cup captain, who is not playing, affect the course of the event? Lawrie Kempe Saffron Waldon The captain's job is very important at the start, getting the pairings right on the first day. After that you're thinking on your feet, because some pairings will work and some won't. You have to keep an open mind and you have to be open with your players. You have to keep them happy- four won't play in each section of the first two days, of course, and some may ask why. Do you think captains should keep their wild-card picks? Mike Bibby Carlisle I am not saying this because of the controversy with Thomas Bjorn and Lee Westwood this time round, but there is no reason to have them. They were introduced for Tony Jacklin, in order to pick guys who were playing on the US Tour, but there's no need to do that now because you can use the world rankings and the European rankings. Was Ian Woosnam right to choose Lee Westwood as a wild-card pick over Thomas Bjorn, and what did you think of Bjorn's reaction? Emma Law Chichester I was disappointed with his reaction, although I was pleased that he then apologised, but perhaps the damage had been done. Ian Woosnam decided to pick Lee Westwood because he's an experienced Ryder Cup player and has won twice at the K Club, and that's fine. At what point does the intense rivalry between Europe and the US become unsportsmanlike and is there a chance of it spilling over into animosity again? Jeremy Rampling London SW12 There is always a chance of the players getting wound up. The difficulty started in 1991 at Kiawah Island, the \"War on the Shore\". It was similar at Brookline in 1999 and that was when premature celebration and triumphalism caused such problems. The real problems only start when spectators start participating - booing the opposition, say. What was your greatest moment as a player and how does it compare to being a victorious Ryder Cup captain? Rich Gilbey Glasgow Teeing up for the 1969 Ryder Cup with Maurice Bembridge - it was my ambition to play in the Ryder Cup. It equals being a winning captain - I'd far rather play at any time. The moment when Sam Torrance putted to win it for Europe in 1985 at The Belfry was also a feeling of pure euphoria. I was sitting at the side of the green with Tony Jacklin. It was very emotional."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
