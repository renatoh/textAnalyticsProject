City's European ambitions have faded with just one win in eight, albeit against Manchester United, while Spurs have only won two away games all season and effectively have nothing left to play for this campaign after their shambolic Euro Vase elimination midweek. Eastlands has been a happy hunting ground for Spurs recently mind, with this hump from Tommy Huddlestone helping them to victory last season, and they also knocked City out on foreign territory on their way to Carling Cup 'glory'. As both Sven and Juande look ahead to a summer of further rebuilding, games like today will perhaps be most notable for spotting which players the gaffers will be waving goodbye to in June. Yes that means you Paul 'the polystyrene wall' Robinson, and you Pascal Chimbonda and probably you as well Benjani, although I doubt you'll be scoring goals like this for Manchester United next season (some people are beyond help, I mean who the hell would actually want to watch that?). Desperate attempt to discredit Lee Dixon and have the turgid git removed from TV studios everywhere for good. Never fear. When they see this footage of him failing to stop talking when the cameras go live the Beeb will be forced to pull the trigger. Probably. Everton have lost 1-0 against Fulham. Crying shame. 3.45pm: Team news! Man City: Hart, Corluka, Onuoha, Dunne, Garrido, Ireland, Gelson, Johnson, Castillo, Elano, Mwaruwari. Subs: Isaksson, Geovanni, Vassell, Jihai, Caicedo. Tottenham: Robinson, Hutton, Woodgate, Dawson, Chimbonda, Lennon, Jenas, Zokora, Malbranque, Berbatov, Keane. Subs: Cerny, Tainio, Huddlestone, Bent, O'Hara. Referee: Mark Clattenburg (Tyne &amp; Wear) Three changes from midweek for Spurs as Lennon comes in for Huddlestone, Dawson replaces King and Hutton returns at the expense of Lee Young-rubbish. Watch out for 19-year-old Caicedo on the City bench, he looked like quite a player in a cameo against Wigan. 3.56pm: City have gained a valuable psychological blow. By wearing white shorts they have forced Spurs away from their preferred all-white get-up and into some nifty navy blue slacks. That could prove vital. You read it here first. 3.59pm: Wigan lead 1-0 at home to Bolton thanks to Emile Heskey, that's a half-time score, after having had Jason Koumas sent-off after only five minutes. 2 mins: Bright start from City, with Castillo at the heart of things, but Spurs hold firm and almost launch an attack of their own until Berbatov is off-side. 4 mins: Great opening for Keane! He leads a counter-attack, exchanges passes with Hutton, and then foxes Onuoha with a lovely piece of skill by the touchline on the right of City's goal. His blast across the face of goal was perhaps not the best option with others better placed. 6 mins: Woodgate stands firm as Benjani tries to power his way through. In King's absence you could go as far as to suggest that he is Spurs' most important player. 8 mins: Chance for City, as Benjani worked an opening wide on the right and slid a good ball into the danger area where Johnson could not quite get a touch on it. City had numbers in the box there and are looking bright. 11 mins: Good interplay from Spurs after Berbatov latched on to a raking ball from Dawson to the left flank. Bright touches from Lennon and Keane set up Jenas who promptly had the punters in Row P diving for cover. 13 mins: Another great through-ball from Dawson almost sets Keane free of the defence but it runs through to Joe Hart. 15 mins: City have lined up with a lot of craft behind Benjani in Elano, Castillo, Ireland and Johnson and it's worrying Spurs. They almost find a way through after some devilish movement from Castillo only to be crowded out on the edge of the area. 19 mins: Gary Naylor has been at Fulham: \"I'm just back from Craven Cottage. I'd like to congratulate Fulham on a well-earned and crucial win. But I can't... at least not yet.\" I don't see why not Gary, it's over. The fat lady's sung. 20 mins: Andy Gray is rightly praising Alan Hutton. He looks a great signing, even at \u00a39m. He's tall, quick, good in the air and in the tackle, and, unlike Pascal Chimbonda, appears to be able to cross a football. 22 mins: Joe Hart got lucky there. A ball swung in by Jenas from the left saw Hart flapping against Dawson in no-mans-land beyond the far post, but Spurs couldn't make the most of it with Malbranque troubling the same spectators in Row P. 25 mins: It's the same old story with Aaron Lennon as a succession of Spurs breaks founder on his wayward final ball. He is half the player of 2006. 26 mins: Double let-off for Spurs, with Michael Dawson at the heart of the Spurs defence producing a valiant double-block to ensure the game remains goalless. First he blocks Johnson's close range shot with a suspicion of hand-ball, then an even better goal-line clearance after Benjani flick-headed Elano's shot goalwards from point blank range. He really should have scored there. 31 mins: Goal! Manchester City 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur. Cracking goal from Robbie Keane! Chimbonda found space high on the left before sliding Keane in behind a sluggish Dunne, as the Irishman fired across Hart into the corner of the net. Whammo. His first goal in seven games. 35 mins: City almost back level as Johnson puts Castillo through on Robinson, but on his weaker right foot and under pressure from the defence he could only mis-kick wide. 37 mins: Great save from Robinson to deny Elano after he found space in a penalty box melee and struck a left-foot shot hard and low to Robinson's right, but the keeper was equal to it. 41 mins: Tom Filochowski is not a Lee Dixon fan either, \"I agree, Lee Dixon is a smug turgid git! I support your campaign to undermine him fair or foul! Get him! He is one of those smiling self satisfied cockney gits who think they are made of teflon and nothing they can do can get them into trouble. They stand aloof waiting to criticise when others make small mistakes. Gavin Peacock is another just like him.\" Indeed Tom, they are unbearable. Not quite the fountain of all things mundane David Platt, but still absolutely unbearable. The decision makers at these corporations have a lot to answer for. 43 mins: Aaron Lennon works himself a shooting position after cutting in from the left-of-centre but the effort is wide and disappointing. He's such an enigma, so much ability but worryingly appears to have lost the compulsion to drive at defences in the way that he did to such effect in 2005/06. 45 mins: The latest in a series of misplaced passes by Didier Zokora sees Benjani slide in Castillo, but unfortunately for City once again it's on Castillo and City's right. Castillo's one-footedness is evident as the chance goes-begging when he tries to shift the ball onto his left-foot and Chimbonda gets a foot in at the vital moment. That's half-time. 4.58pm: Some emails. Sheffield man and probable Derek Dooley fan Nick Evans knows far too much about Dixon for my liking, \"Can I be the 214th pedant to point out that Lee Dixon was born in Manchester, and would therefore need extraordinarily good hearing to have been able to hear the Bow Bells.\" Of course Nick. Simon Frank from the Bahamas has a question, \"Is Michael Dawson showing the kind of form that earned him some 'Future England Captain-esque' nickname when he was with us at Forest about 5 years ago? It seems he is in and out of the Tottenham side.\" Tricky one Simon. He looked to be progressing nicely alongside Ledley King, very much the blood-and-guts to King's serene, but Ledley's injuries seem to have exposed him somewhat as being not quite the player he was thought of. His positioning is not the best, but alongside a Woodgate or a King that is not such an issue. England looks further away than ever for him at the moment, and he will struggle to play regularly at Spurs if King ever regains a consistent level of fitness, but that's a very big if. Rumours that Spurs are sniffing around Daniel Jarque of Espanyol are not a glowing endorsement of the management's opinion of him either, but personally I still think he has a lot to offer. 4.59pm: Substitution for Spurs as Huddlestone replaces Aaron Lennon, curious one, apparently it's tactical. Jenas has moved to the right hand side. Spurs will benefit from Huddlestone's passing but miss Lennon's pace, if not his profligacy. Wigan have won against Bolton 1-0 thanks to Emile Heskey. 47 mins: Some neat interplay from City sees them progress to the edge of the Spurs area twice in quick succession without success. First Elano fails to see Benjani's run, then Benjani's shot is blocked by a well-timed lunge by the effortlessly exceptional Woodgate. 51 mins: Another chance for Castillo foiled what is looking increasingly to be to be a prosthetic right-foot! Through on Robinson again after a scuffle in the area following Benjani's cross he looked certain to score but was again crowded out while trying to get his shot away with his right. 54 mins: Spurs are looking bright, but almost too relaxed in the final third, as though Berba has rubbed off on his team-mates. 58 mins: Goal! Manchester City 1-1 Spurs. Stephen Ireland scores for City just as he was about to be replaced by Darius Vassell. More good running from Benjani on the left and a deep cross to the back-post found Castillo, who's mis-hit left-footed shot was headed towards goal by Elano for Ireland to poke home. He looked to coming from an offside position but no flag went up and Spurs have been punished, probably justice after Pascal Chimbonda's scandalous goal at White Hart Lane earlier in the season. It is City's first goal for four games and the 100th in matches involving Tottenham this season for those who love pointless statistics. 66 mins: Huddlestone's well-hit shot cannot find a way through a mass of Blue shirt's. Spurs need more from Berbatov in the remainder of this game. City need to score again when they are so far in the ascendancy. Bent and O'Hara are coming on for Spurs for Keane and Malbranque. Good news for City, Bent was woeful in midweek making a mockery of the decision to sell Defoe. Nick Evans is back, \"I'll be honest Sam, I'd never heard of Derek Dooley until he died, being as I am both Mancunian (like Lee Dixon) and far too young to remember. I'm a bit worried about how City's season appears to be falling apart, though - although I'd have taken a top half finish at the start of the season.\" No need to be worried I think Nick, with a young and relatively threadbare squad it would take a serious effort to sustain top-six form, especially without a recognised goal scorer. I'm sure Sven will strengthen well in the summer and you'll be a real force next season. 70 mins: Darius Vassell is on for the one-legged Castillo. Peter Green is an observant fellow, \"Now I see why the Special Juande wants his players to lose weight. Ireland was played onside by Dawson's arse.\" 72 mins: Goal! Manchester City 2-1 Spurs! Nedhum Onuoha scores a bullet header for City from Elano's corner from the right as Spurs' set-piece frailties resurface. Robinson haplessly didn't move as the ball went straight above him but such was the power of the header you can't really blame him I suppose. 74 mins: Emma Raccoon has it in a nutshell, \"Stupid decision to take Keane, Tottenham's captain, and their best player off. It was only a matter of time before City scored again.\" Don't like to question Juande too much Emma, but I think you're right. Bent is balls. 77 mins: Johnson goes close for City after a ricochet in the area but can only poke wide. Andy Gray has made a good point that the removal of Lennon has stifled Spurs, denying them the option of stretching the play. Personally I would have hauled off Zokora, who has made Michael Johnson look like Franz Beckenbauer today, and Johnson hasn't played that well. 80 mins: Shots for Spurs as Huddlestone hits straight at Hart from distance, and then Berbatov nominally tests the keeper, as the ball drops to him on the volley on the edge of the area in the sort of scenario from which he so often produces the unlikely. This time the effort is weak but Hart somehow fumbles it for a corner, which predictably comes to nothing. 83 mins: Spurs have a goal wrongly disallowed as Darren Bent turns in O'Hara's free-kick, only for it to be disallowed because Berbatov was wrongly believed to be behind the last man. City's turn to look nervous. 86 mins: Gary Naylor is ahead of his time, \"Anyone else think that the offside rule isn't that difficult as long as you actually think about it? Take MotD last night. The officials were castigated for ruling out Adebayor's \"goal\" since the last touch was Boateng's. My Sky+ freeze frame shows Adebayor offside when Hleb plays the ball into Boateng - hence the officials were correct and Shearer should have carried on riding that bike until he ended up in the Channel.\" I wonder what they would have made of that one Gary. And as for Shearer... Sun Jihai is on for City instead of Benjani, and Caicedo also appears to be on, which I must have missed while on a call of nature. 90 mins: Three minutes of stoppage-time, Dawson is playing up front for Spurs now, who are not offering much threat of a cutting edge up top. 92 mins: Spurs' last chance goes as Huddlestone takes a long cross off Berbatov's chest and heads weakly at Hart. Berbatov looks furious. Rightly so. Thanks for reading, and have a lovely Sunday evening. Make sure you join Lawrence Booth for the cricket at 9.30pm. FINAL WHISTLE! It's all over, and Spurs have handed that to City on a plate with some wacky substitutions and weak defending. City were good value for their win, looking bright throughout but still in need of a goal scorer. A good day for Nedum Onuoha, who's winning goal was his first for City. Further deliberation for Spurs who will point to two dubious off-side decisions but made a rod for their own back, and are now staring at a depressing end to their season unless they can start getting something out of games like this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
