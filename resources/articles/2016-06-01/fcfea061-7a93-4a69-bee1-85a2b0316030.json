Northern Ireland were beaten 1-0 by Poland in their first appearance at a European Championship on Sunday when Arkadiusz Milik\u2019s second-half goal brought their 12-game unbeaten run to a deserved end. With the world champions, Germany, awaiting Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s team in their final game in Group C, there is heightened pressure on Northern Ireland to avoid defeat against Ukraine in Lyon on Thursday. O\u2019Neill opted for an ultra-defensive approach in Nice, where his team failed to have one shot on target against Wojciech Szczesny, the Poland goalkeeper. Although not going so far as to question his manager\u2019s tactics, the experienced Evans admitted a different approach will be necessary to threaten Mykhaylo Fomenko\u2019s team, who are bottom of the group, having lost 2-0 to Germany. The West Bromwich Albion defender said: \u201cMichael has hinted that we might try different things against different teams, especially Ukraine who are very good from the wide areas. [Andriy] Yarmolenko is probably their most dangerous player. He plays off the right side and that\u2019s something Michael has talked about, so we\u2019ll analyse the Poland game and see if we can take any positives from aspects of our game. \u201cThere were times in the first half where they had a lot of possession and I thought we defended quite well but on the flip side we found it hard to get out. \u201cWe had a lot of men behind the ball. I think we\u2019ll learn from the fact that maybe at times we need to try to play a bit more. We rushed things a bit. Especially in that heat and against that quality of opposition, you know if you keep giving the ball back to them that it\u2019s going to be a long night. I thought we showed good endeavour and we worked our socks off, which we\u2019re always going to do, but maybe we need to play a bit better. It would have been nice to take something from the game but we know we can\u2019t lose, especially with going to Paris against Germany in the last game who are going to dominate better than anyone. It might be a make-or-break for us against Ukraine.\u201d Northern Ireland won their qualifying group thanks in part to supreme defensive organisation and that was in evidence in Nice, where Evans and Gareth McAuley excelled as part of a three-man central defence. O\u2019Neill\u2019s selection against Poland, however, was more defensive, with Shane Ferguson a surprise inclusion at left wing-back having featured rarely in qualifying. Evans may be given the left-back role in a flat four against Dynamo Kyiv\u2019s Yarmolenko. \u201cMichael said to me before the tournament started that he might need me to play left-back and I told him that wouldn\u2019t be an issue,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI\u2019ve played there for West Brom this season. Shane Ferguson was in the League One play-off with Millwall and I thought he played well against Poland. He\u2019s another who can step in there, so the manager has a few different options to try.\u201d Northern Ireland finished above their fellow Euro 2016 qualifiers Romania and Hungary in reaching their first major tournament for 30 years but Evans admitted Poland were a step up in class. The former Manchester United defender said: \u201cYou can play teams like that and get them on an off night in tough conditions in Windsor Park but out here, as much as it\u2019s the biggest game of our careers, it was a massive game for Poland, too, and you could see the quality they had. We don\u2019t see it in the Premier League a lot but European teams are very good at controlling the game. \u201cYou could see what a great understanding they have of the game. They know when to play possession football and when to attack. They were 1-0 up and made us run and took the game away from us by doing it. Your legs are heavy, you\u2019re exhausted and, when you do get the ball back, it\u2019s very difficult then to produce that bit of quality because you\u2019re almost dizzy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
