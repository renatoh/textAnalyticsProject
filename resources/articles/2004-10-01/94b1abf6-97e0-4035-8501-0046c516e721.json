But Labour was reassured that its core vote was holding up after winning more than 40% of the vote. Fresh from taking part in a bus-top victory tour, Labour campaigners said that predictions that the Lib Dems were on the cusp of an electoral breakthrough had been proved wrong by Labour's byelection victory. Fraser Kemp, Labour's Hartlepool campaign manager and a government whip, said: \"This result is a disaster for the Liberal Democrats. Their bandwagon has been firmly stopped in Hartlepool. They threw everything they had at this but they failed to do it, after a 10-week campaign and with an incumbent government in power for seven years. This shows they've serious electoral problems and have failed to make the breakthrough. The Lib Dems are going nowhere in British politics.\" But he added: \"Ultimately it's worse for the Conservatives. For the official opposition to come fourth is something that has never happened since the second world war and is devastating. It's not for me to speculate on the internal machinations of the Tory party this weekend but I wouldn't think they'd be pretty.\" In the wake of the result Chris Rennard, the Lib Dems' chief executive and election guru, insisted the party was not downbeat about coming from 17,000 votes down to 2,033 within taking the north-east constituency. And he insisted the Lib Dems had now proved themselves the challengers to the government in urban Britain by coming from a poor third to first, or a close second, in four consecutive byelections - Brent East, Leicester South, Birmingham Hodge Hill, and now Hartlepool - within a year. With the Lib Dems achieving swings of 28%, 21% and 27% against Labour in the first three of these byelections, the general - perhaps unfair - expectation was that they would manage an equally dramatic feat again. But Lord Rennard said the Lib Dems' 18.8% swing from Labour was still \"at the top end of the range of historic byelection surges\", while 15.6% of Conservatives - who came fourth - had also defected to the Lib Dems. They had thought they could push the Labour vote down to 40% and instead Iain Wright, the successful candidate, achieved 41%. Lord Rennard said: \"The Lib Dems are now clearly the alternative to Labour in towns and cities, while the Conservatives are in freefall in urban seats, having come fourth to Ukip after starting in second place.\" The UK Independence party, which polled 3,193 votes to the Tories' 3,044, helped by a local candidate, had been a \"significant factor\" in the byelection, as was the fact that the anti-war vote was not as significant as it had been in Brent East and Leicester South with their large Muslim communities. But the real difficulty for the Lib Dems, whose leader, Charles Kennedy, made six visits to the seat, was that, with 14 candidates to choose from, they had been unable to squeeze sufficiently the fringe groups and parties, as they had done in the byelections last September and in July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
