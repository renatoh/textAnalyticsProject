Shanghai entrepreneur Li Jing is brain damaged after a catastrophic explosion. He begins to recover, but can no longer communicate in Chinese, reverting to the halting English he first spoke as a child in the US. This proves disastrous for his relationship with his wife Zhou Meiling and small son Pang Pang. Enter Rosalyn Neal, an American neurologist seeking more than professional distraction from a failed marriage. An awkward triangle develops: Rosalyn's outsider status in Shanghai dovetails with Li Jing's emotional ostracism from his family, while alienated Meiling attempts to save Li Jing's floundering business. Though Rosalyn the flame-haired temptress is unconvincing, the fundamental links between language and identity are minutely explored. The Canal, by Lee Rourke (Melville House, \u00a39.99) A man sits, day by enervating day, on a canalside bench near a rundown estate in north London. At first his only companions are the coots, moorhens and tiresomely symbolic swans of the polluted river. He observes the manoeuvres of expensively dressed office workers in the building opposite. He makes ponderous pronouncements to himself; compares the thud of bricks thrown by the local feral youth to the sound of falling bodies from the World Trade Centre. His study is boredom \u2013 he even quits his job to pursue it. He is joined on the bench by an enigmatic young woman, intense of speech, in love with the gratuitous soul-sickness of the post-millennium age. As, it seems, is this book, burdened with mock profundities and anorak anxieties. There is some humour \u2013 swiftly gagged. What remains is urban disaffection writ large in prose both unedited and unedifying. Saraswati Park, by Anjali Joseph (Fourth Estate, \u00a312.99) A shabby Bombay suburb is the subject of a subtle novel infused with multiple regrets. Mohan and Lakshmi, largely indifferent to each other now their children have dispersed, welcome Mohan's nephew Ashish, a directionless final-year English undergraduate, to share their small apartment. Mohan, a letter-writer for illiterates at the GPO, reads Henry James and daydreams; Lakshmi is bullied by her autocratic older brother and in thrall to daytime television. Ashish is willingly seduced \u2013 first by a wealthy fellow student, and then, by an older tutor. Very little happens, yet how true to life it seems \u2013 the background of disconsolate rains and chattering mynah birds entirely Bombay, the preoccupations universal. \"Mohan thought, 'A man goes on a journey . . .' He had no idea what the rest of the sentence was\" \u2013 a typical statement in a generous book where absolutes are neither sought nor found. London Triptych, by Jonathan Kemp (Myriad Editions, \u00a37.99) Kemp's history of male prostitution is an ambitious work in which he aims to \"give voice to the voiceless\". London is the liberating focus for three characters spanning a century. Jack Rose is catapulted from an East End slum to train as a rent boy, going on to become one of the shadowy \"panthers\" with which Oscar Wilde surrounded himself before his disgrace. Colin Read, a repressed artist in the introverted 1950s, is inspired and terrified by Gore, the man who models for him. The most poignant section of the narrative belongs to David, a late-90s clubber with a poet's soul, betrayed by his lover, and in prison. It's fast-moving and sharply written, though the frequent explicit sex scenes make the whole seem jadedly one-dimensional, and an improbable intersection of the main figures is a clumsy detraction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
