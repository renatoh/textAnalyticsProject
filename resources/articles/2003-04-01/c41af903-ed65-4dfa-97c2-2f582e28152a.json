I have two problems: a mortgage and my pension. As part of the divorce settlement, our house in Bristol will be sold and we have agreed that I will have \u00a3100,000 from the house - or more if it fetches a higher price. I will also get at least \u00a316,000 from an investment policy which matures in May, so I reckon on having a minimum cash sum of \u00a3115,000 with which to buy somewhere to live. Apart from \u00a31,500 in a mini Isa for emergencies, I have no other savings but, as I can easily manage with a small flat, I hope to be able to buy a new home outright. The property market in Bristol is horrendous and I don't really know what I am going to be able to afford. For \u00a3115,000, I might be able to buy a two- bedroom Victorian place, but it would be in a dodgy area and not particularly safe. I don't know whether to take out a mortgage so I could afford a better property. At least that would give me a more expensive house from which I could downsize at a later stage. If I need to raise, say, a further \u00a320,000, what is the best way of doing so? Can I get a mortgage for such a small amount? My second problem is how to enhance my pension. I have worked in the Civil Service for 13 years, most of it part-time, and earn \u00a317,000. I have given up any claim on my former husband's pension in exchange for a larger share in the equity of our property. He is 53 and my state pension will have to be based on his contributions. I have asked for a pension forecast but have been waiting five months for it. Apart from that, I will be solely reliant on my own pension. Eighteen months ago, this was reckoned to give me, at retirement, a total of \u00a33,607 a year plus a lump sum of \u00a310,821. I live quite modestly, although it is easy to say that when I earn \u00a31,000 a month. If I had much less, I am sure it would be difficult. I have no debts and no large outgoings. I estimate that, realistically, I should be able to put a minimum of \u00a3200 a month into some sort of pension. Would it be best to buy added years to the Civil Service pension or should I be looking at a combination of savings? I can buy almost five added years for \u00a3198 a month. Action plan Some smaller building societies impose a minimum \u00a325,000 on mortgages but large banks like Abbey National, Nationwide and the Halifax will lend smaller amounts. Peter Gettins, product analyst at Town &amp;Country Mortgages, says: 'A fixed-rate mortgage is the best one to look at. A two-year scheme will get her the lowest rate but, if she wants stability for longer, a five-year is also worth looking at because there are still some good rates there. Julie will have a vast amount of equity in the house, which is good, and her income is not an issue.' But lenders will insist that you repay over a fairly short period, says Gettins: 'While most lenders are happy to lend past retirement age, they will not go past 70 and will want to see post-retirement income to cover the debt.' On a repayment mortgage, this makes your repayments more expensive than if you repaid over 25 years. Borrowing \u00a320,000 at 4.5 per cent over 10 years costs about \u00a3200 a month, which would use up all your spare money. You could choose an interest-only loan, which would cost about \u00a375 a month, but you must have a plan for repaying the debt. You could save regularly in Isas or pay off chunks when you can afford it. Or if you downsize in, say, 15 years' time, you could take a gamble that higher house prices will give you enough profit to pay off the mortgage. 'That is probably a reasonable gamble,' says Gettins. James Dalby, head of research at Bates Investment Services believes your mortgage ought to be as small as possible to make sure you are not still in debt when you retire: 'I would also recommend that any mortgage is repayment based.' He adds: 'I suggest Julie holds back \u00a310,000 of the \u00a3115,000 as a safety net to help with the costs of buying a new property and leave her with an emergency fund. The money could be held in an easy access account such as Scottish Widows Instant Transfer account where the interest rate has been consistently high and is currently 3.75 per cent.' You should check that your cash Isa is earning a good rate of interest. Safeway's mini Cash Isa pays a very competitive 4.2 per cent. Your state pension forecast is taking an extremely long time, although the Department for Work and Pensions says that divorce inquiries do take longer than others. You will not be able to claim your basic state pension on your husband's national insurance contribution record until he reaches 65. But in any case you will not be entitled to a state pension at 60 because you will be caught by the later state pension age for women. As you were born on 28 April 1951, you will reach state pension age on 6 May 2012, when you will be 61 years and 8 days old. The only consolation is that there will then be less time to wait before your ex-husband reaches 65. Dalby advises: 'Before deciding whether to buy added years, Julie should ask her employer for a forecast of what this would give her in terms of extra pension and lump sum. This is important in determining whether the option provides good value.' He adds: 'As a rule of thumb, it is sensible to split any money between boosting pension provision and building up other savings. This often proves to be the most flexible strategy in funding for retirement.' You could put \u00a3100 a month towards buying added years and \u00a3100 into an Isa. Dalby recommends starting with an equity-based fund such as AXA Select Growth which invests in a range of world markets. As you get nearer retirement, you should move your money to a safer place. Julie's plan 1. Think carefully before taking on a mortgage. 2. Buying a more expensive house could be worthwhile if you think house prices will rise. 3. If you do take a mortgage, have a clear plan for repaying it. 4. Keep back part of your lump sum as an emergency fund. 5. Split your monthly savings between pension contributions and more flexible savings. 6. Find out how much benefit you would get from buying added years before deciding if this is the best route.
