News of the proposed law, which would force 13,000 establishments where smoking is currently permitted to clear their air, came six weeks after the mayor, a passionate anti-smoker, hiked taxes on packets of cigarettes from 8 cents to $1.42, making them the most expensive anywhere in the US at $7.50 (\u00a34.90) a pack. But banning smoking in all bars and restaurants would put New York - a city famous for its commitment to unhealthy living - on a par with health-conscious California and Delaware, the only two states to have adopted an outright ban. Hundreds of smaller areas within the US have introduced similar policies. \"If you are a bartender or a waiter or a waitress and you work in an establishment where there's smoking, in an eight-hour day it's equivalent to you smoking half a pack of cigarettes,\" Mr Bloomberg said yesterday. \"No employer would allow their employees to work in a place with asbestos in the air, and this is just as dangerous.\" The proposal builds on wide-ranging restrictions pushed through by Mr Giuliani in 1995, against the wishes of most restaurateurs and the tobacco lobby, resulting in a ban on smoking in all offices and theatres. At the moment, smoking is permitted in most self-contained bars and pubs, in properly ventilated restaurant bars, and in establishments with fewer than 35 seats. It is actively encouraged at Angelo and Maxie's, a steak-house and cigar bar on Park Avenue in Manhattan, whose general manager, Reed Goldstein, yesterday condemned the mayor's proposals as \"ludicrous \". \"There's just a lot of people who smoke in New York,\" Mr Goldstein said.\"Half my staff smoke, too, so they like working around smoke. Now people are going to be standing in the street and smoking instead of enjoying themselves inside. The mayor 's worried about the person who inhales second-hand smoke, but if you stand behind a bus in this city you'll breathe far worse fumes.\" New York smokers have found a variety of ways to circumvent the new taxes, from making shopping trips into New Jersey to ordering online from Native American reservations, which enjoy wide-ranging tax exemptions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
