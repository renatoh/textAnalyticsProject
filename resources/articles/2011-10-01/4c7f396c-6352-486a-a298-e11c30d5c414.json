Moderate levels of ground level ozone extended as far north as Fort William on 28 September and many areas broke World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. Before reaching the UK, the warm air spent two days crossing France, collecting pollution en route. The greatest pollution problems occurred in major cities where traffic added to the imported smog. A pollution alert for nitrogen dioxide was declared in Paris on 29 September. On the same day London also experienced problems with nitrogen dioxide and airborne particulates, which continued for four days until 2 October. Fresher Atlantic air reached Northern Ireland and Scotland first and then pushed over the whole UK, finally clearing the summertime smog from London and the south-east on 4 October. Summertime smog is very unusual at this time of year. Analysis of pollution between 2000 and 2009 around London suggests that the chances of breaching the WHO guidelines for ground-level ozone are normally less than 5% during the last week of September. Summer measurements of ground-level ozone began in Harwell, Oxfordshire, in 1976 and measurements for October extend back to 1984. The ground-level ozone at Harwell this year set a new October record, beating the previous one set in 2005."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
