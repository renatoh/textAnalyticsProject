He was 55. The quartet, which formed in New York in 1974, became hugely influential, although never had any hits. The band's songs, including Sheena Was a Punk Rocker, I Wanna be Sedated, Teenage Lobotomy and I Wanna Sniff Some Glue, gave an early voice to the boredom of a generation that found expression in the British punk scene of the late 1970s. \"We couldn't write about love or cars, so we sang about this stuff, like glue-sniffing. We thought it was funny. We thought we could get away with anything,\" Johnny Ramone once said. The band retired in 1996 following a farewell tour. Joey Ramone, the singer, died of lymphatic cancer in 2001 and Dee Dee Ramone, the bassist, died from a drug overdose in 2002. The drummer, Tommy Ramone, is the only surviving member of the original band. In a message posted yesterday on the band's website, Johnny Ramone's widow, Linda Cummings, wrote: \"We had tried everything but the cancer had spread all over his body. He died at peace in his sleep... \"As God is my witness, I am sure that the boys are together in the afterlife, for they were brothers in the true sense of the word.\" Like the other members of the band, Johnny Ramone had a middle-class background. He was born Johnny Cummings on Long Island, and grew up in Queens, New York. He attended military academy, and started playing guitar at 22, having worked as a builder. Ramone was reputedly an alias used by Paul McCartney. Johnny Ramone's political views set him aside from many of his peers. He was an outspoken Republican, whose favourite president was Ronald Reagan, and a supporter of the National Rifle Association. When the band was indicted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 Johnny proclaimed: \"God bless President Bush and God bless America\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
