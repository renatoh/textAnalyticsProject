But few would resort, as outgoing Tory treasurer Michael Ashcroft has, to penning 311 densely argued pages to satisfy their appetite some six years after the event. The book, Dirty Politics Dirty Times, details the Conservative peer's long-running and complex legal battle with the Times under its previous editor Peter Stothard. The effort Lord Ashcroft has put in to giving his side of the story raises intriguing questions about the extent to which celebrities and others in public life may choose to follow his lead and turn the spotlight back on the journalists who investigated them. The book has a strong vengeful streak. Stothard is called \"ranting, misguided and obsessional\" among other things and a senior Times reporter is outed as a serial cocaine abuser. Lord Ashcroft's spokesman said that the repeated references to the reporter's drug habit were entirely appropriate because of his \"rank hypocrisy\" in accusing the peer of being involved in drug running while indulging in class As himself. With the current clamour to force Tory leadership candidate David Cameron to confirm or deny whether he took drugs in his younger days, the issue of whether journalists should themselves be as pure as the driven snow is bound to arise again. Pop star Robbie Williams also recently lashed out at journalists he accused of destroying Kate Moss. \"People I took cocaine with now write that she should not take cocaine. Some want to disavow people's lives,\" he said. Lord Ashcroft's book, published last week, claims that Labour MPs and advisers colluded with the Times to smear his name with the ultimate aim of destabilising the Conservative party and ousting William Hague, the former leader who provides a quote for the dust jacket. Friends of the peer said that while he acknowledged that the book was unlikely to sell in huge numbers, he hoped that those involved in politics and the media would read it and that the \"ripple effect\" would help re-establish his reputation. Lord Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, said that the ubiquity of the internet was also a major factor in his decision to devote so much time and effort to giving his side of the story. \"Given the sheer weight of coverage at the time and the phenomenon of the internet, many of the articles found their way on to the web. Every time he enters into negotiations on a new business deal, the first thing they do is type 'Michael Ashcroft' into Google. This is obviously very bad news. There was an element of wanting to set the record straight,\" he said. In addition to setting out his case, which eventually resulted in a libel action that was dropped after Rupert Murdoch agreed to facilitate a front page clarification, Lord Ashcroft also seeks to get his own back. The majority of the self-published book is devoted to the ins and outs of the original claims, later retracted, that the businessman was under suspicion from US authorities for drug dealing and money laundering in Belize. Public relations experts are split on the wisdom of returning to the scene of old battles. Some think it better to let things lie once the news agenda has moved on. But Lord Bell, habitually referred to as Margaret Thatcher's favourite PR man and an adviser to Lord Ashcroft at the time, believes he has done the right thing. \"It depends on the individual. In this case, it was absolutely the right thing to do. It's rankled with him and nagged at him and this has enabled him to get it off his chest. He's rich enough to be able to do it. The original settlement didn't receive widespread coverage and an awful lot of people people may still not be aware of all the facts.\" In the book Lord Ashcroft gives every impression of wanting to continue his battle with the individuals involved. But he is also at pains to draw a line under the affair. Friends say he now has a cordial relationship with Times editor Robert Thomson and that when he bumped into Rupert Murdoch last week for the first time since the legal tussle, the pair chatted amiably. Yet his rancour at New Labour and his perceived enemies in the press remain. Whether others could afford to spend the time and money investigating the development of a story in which they were the principal character is doubtful. Lord Ashcroft is clearly short of neither. With a fortune estimated at \u00a3797m, enabling him to virtually bankroll the Tory party for the past five years, the cost of his vanity publishing escapade was not an issue. Whether such endeavours are of any interest at all to the general public is another issue entirely - at the end of last week, Lord Ashcroft's book had yet to trouble Amazon's top 3,000 bestsellers list."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
