He had a fierce and sometimes frightening intelligence, with a razor-sharp wit and a machine-gun laugh. He was also a brilliant raconteur, a lover of all things theatrical, a scurrilous gossip and an inspiration to many. Peter was born in Northampton, the only child of Reginald Sibley, a draughtsman in the car industry, and his wife, Winifred (nee Lilleman), a dressmaker. After Northampton grammar school for boys Peter studied languages at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University, where he worked in the student theatre with the director Michael Rudman on six productions. As a 21-year-old he went straight in as house manager at the Royal Court theatre in London. It was there that our friendship started, as my mother, Helen Montagu, was working as general manager in the theatre at the same time as Peter. He became a fixture in our childhood home and joined us on family holidays to Italy and France. After many years working at the Royal Court, Peter moved to Germany in the 1970s to take up a job in the publicity department of Polydor Records, whose biggest stars at the time were James Brown, Isaac Hayes and the Who. When touring Europe with Brown, he would routinely phone ahead to the best florist in the next town on the schedule, arranging for dozens of red roses to be hurled at Brown as he stepped off the plane. In 1980 he wrote lyrics for the album Cathode Mamma with the Italian new wave electronica duo Krisma, including for the song Many Kisses, which was released as a single and became popular across continental Europe. He finished with Polydor in 1982, but continued to live in Germany on and off for the rest of his life. He had spells back in London, including, in the 80s, as production manager on the musicals Tommy and 42nd Street, working closely again with my mother, who was by then a successful producer. A superb cook, in 1984 Peter also opened a restaurant, 7 Down Street, in Mayfair, which was ecstatically reviewed but lasted only until 1986. He was diagnosed as HIV positive in the late 80s and lived with the condition for more than 30 years. He had a stroke in 2011 and thereafter had to use a wheelchair. Shortly afterwards he moved into a flatshare in Berlin, in the Lebensort Vielfalt, a pioneering project allowing gay people of different ages and abilities to live together with a restaurant, library and shared garden. He became an outspoken advocate of gay rights, especially issues around alternative living and ageing. With his indomitable spirit and dazzling dress sense he was the perfect poster boy for the Gay not Grey movement, a grouping that came together in the Lebensort Vielfalt and held events in the cafe/cabaret space there.
