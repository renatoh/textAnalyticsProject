So You Think You Can Nurse? (Five) had Janet Street-Porter, Gail Porter and Sean Hughes working as auxiliary nurses in Barnsley general hospital. None of them showed any signs of thinking they could nurse. Indeed, you would be looking at Janet Street-Porter for some time before you were reminded of a cool figure in white. She cut a swift swathe through the hospital, from the deputy director of nursing, who was ill-advised enough to mention the importance of inter-personal skills (\"You're talking new age bollocks now\"), to the cleaning lady (\"I didn't mean to call her a Nazi. I meant it as a term of endearment\"). Her manner towards Fred, a resuscitation dummy, was brisk: \"Come on! Pull yourself together!\" On balance, 90-year-old Miriam bore up best, even when addressed as Lilian. \"I've had 11 children,\" she said firmly. \"Brilliant! I haven't had any,\" said Janet. \"Aren't you married then?\" \"I've been married four times. Don't get me started.\" \"I'm on my fourth great-great-great-grandchild,\" said Miriam competitively. \"Darling, get this soup down, otherwise you won't be seeing your grandchildren,\" grated the ministering angel. Janet was told to work on her softer side and cut out the cursing. Sean Hughes, conversely, tended to drift around in a dislocated way, looking for somewhere to smoke. A longing to lie down for a while often swept over him. Perhaps to demonstrate what a really long lie down looks like, he was shown a corpse (\"Do I have to?\"). A wit in Love's Labour's Lost is told to visit the speechless sick and make them smile. He wasn't enthusiastic either. Sean was instructed to shave. Gail Porter, already completely bald, proved a positive girl guide, smiling and singing under all difficulties. On the subject of singing, here's a handy hint. If you are trying to restart a heart, pump away to the sprightly rhythm of \"Nellie the elephant packed her trunk and said goodbye to the circus.\" And here's an even handier hint: \"It is recommended that you do this in your head. Relatives tend not to appreciate you singing Nellie the Elephant.\" Any vehicle involving Janet Street-Porter proceeds in a series of small explosions. She took against the shared accommodation offered or, as she called it, Prisoner Cell Block H. \"I can't use a toilet that Sean Hughes is using, and this mattress is shit.\" Thereafter, Sean and Gail appeared to huddle together, leaving sharp elbow room between themselves and Janet. I was tickled pink. A reassuring sign of health. Party Animals (BBC2) has been heavily trailed, like a smart and stylish coat. The temptation to step on it is severe. It is concocted like a recipe. A pinch of sweet geek. (You will be glad of Danny's existence because everyone looks and behaves very much alike, while he wears distinctive specs and a floppy forelock.) A spoonful of Asian babe. (I am sorry for Ashika, not so much because her Tory boss toys with her as because she is given the almost unspeakable line: \"A little idyll.\") Two generous handfuls of nubile journalist. (\"You've slept with all the rising stars of the Conservative party.\") A vinegary gay character and an oily lobbyist for dressing. They all laugh heartily, not to say incessantly, in bars, which leads me to believe that, if only we could have heard the jokes, we would have had a cracking comedy show here. It is a series about the staff who minister to ministers. Researchers, aides, interns. Everyone is in their 20s, which may be why Jake, a failure at 31, is ruthlessly mown down in a car crash at the end of episode one. Although not before suggesting a wholly new way of watching Kirsty Wark on Newsnight. Upside down through your legs. There used to be a chocolate bar called Fry's Five Boys in which each boy exhibited a different reaction, and it's something like that. The boys show competition, aggression, subversion, seduction and all the other shuns. The girls hardly get a lick in. In Ray Mears' Wild Food (BBC2), our overgrown boy scout has an academic sidekick. Professor Hillman is a paleo-ethno botanist and he had a tale to tell. Having eaten some mushrooms kindly donated by the mycology department of Cardiff University, he went for a pint. In the pub his vision, memory and breathing failed. This is not unheard of in a pub, but Professor Hillman realised he had eaten a deadly fungus. \"Before I became unconscious, I wrote 'Psathyrella' on a piece of paper and pinned it to my chest for the doctors.\" I am full of admiration for anyone who can spell psathyrella at the best of times, let alone as sound and vision fade. \"Fade sound and vision\" is a television term, which I always felt would look rather good on a tombstone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
