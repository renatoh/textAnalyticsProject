Since 1970 women have accounted for only 16% of Australian film directors; the new initiatives will fund projects where three out of four key creative roles (director, writer, producer and protagonist) are occupied by a woman. One question lingering at the edges of the discussion about gender equality is whether men can or should make female-led films. This debate raged during the production of director Tom Cowan\u2019s savage 1977 revenge drama Journey Among Women, a period piece about nine female convicts who escape brutal conditions in an Australian penal colony and form their own Amazonian-like tribe. Depending on who you believe, it almost destroyed the film. On-set tumult that beleaguered its production long ago drifted from memory to myth (frustratingly, the director refused to set the record straight on the DVD commentary), but enough is known to paint a picture of chaos and clashing personalities. Most of the cast and crew were feminists who disagreed mid-shoot on the direction the film was headed. Meetings were staged during production and debates ensued about topics such as the nature of sexuality and glamour. Some demanded the script change to accommodate a different vision while others championed the original story, which was cowritten by Australian feminist playwright, poet and novelist Dorothy Hewett. Some of the actors jumped behind the camera, directing themselves, and others simply jumped ship. The resulting film is a strange beast, fashioned in a grainy faux documentary style that in part distinguishes it from the look and feel of Ozploitation films made at the time. It does, however, cross over into risqu\u00e9 countercultural terrain: a curious mixture of art cinema and the drive-in. The film was a hit, punters perhaps lured by its lashings of nudity and lesbian romance. The box office takings would have relieved Cowan and producer John Weiley, who both mortgaged their homes to finance it. One of their inspirations was director Bert Deling\u2019s racy 1975 drug drama Pure Shit, which Cowan (a long-time cinematographer) shot and which shared the same editor, John Scott. A sense of injustice is the catalyst for the story. Well-to-do Lady Elizabeth Harrington (June Pritchard) is the daughter of a judge and engaged to Captain McEwan (Martin Phelan). She visits a disgusting hovel where convicts are imprisoned and witnesses a solider raping one of them. Aghast, she reacts by shooting the rapist in the head at point-blank range then leads the group out of captivity and into the bush. They form a group of primitive vagabonds who, experiencing their first real taste of freedom, respond by dancing, drinking, screaming, stripping off and generally creating mayhem. Among the strange sights is a funeral scene where the group sit around holding hands and humming. At one point an Aboriginal woman named Kameragul (Lillian Crombie) appears to teach them survival skills and it\u2019s not certain whether the relationship between her and the other women is strictly platonic. Dialogue exchanges tend to be choppy and disconnected. One of Journey Among Women\u2019s biggest problems is its messy approach to structuring conversations, which means that despite how closely the camera is oriented to the cast, the direction at times feels oddly impersonal. Its helter-skelter mood and tempo is something the viewer acclimatises to and its energy proves oddly liberating. The story leads to a bloody finale in which two groups of people behave like savages and the women take revenge on men who abused them. The eventual showdown, incorporating the only special effect used by Cowan, is the classic fire-bathed scene of Australian cinema. It\u2019s not a moment quickly forgotten. The same can be said of the film, which is ultimately rewarding but at times difficult and even gruelling to sit through."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
