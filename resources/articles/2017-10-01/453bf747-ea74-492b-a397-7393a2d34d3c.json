But truthfully Tuesday night\u2019s loss to Trinidad &amp; Tobago was a failure years in the making, an outcome undeserving of the surprise it elicited. Not after how the Americans stumbled from the gate in Concacaf\u2019s qualifying hexagonal, prompting the dismissal of Jurgen Klinsmann with a not-insignificant $6.2m golden handshake. Even after a constellation of factors limited the United States to a scant 12 points in the first nine of 10 qualifiers, Bruce Arena\u2019s side needed only a draw against the world\u2019s 99th-ranked team to be virtually certain of securing at least a play-off spot. Instead, a stunningly torpid defeat, paired with Panama\u2019s last-gasp win over Costa Rica, leaves the US out of the World Cup for the first time in 32 years and represents a disastrous setback for the sport\u2019s growth here. The Catastrophe at Couva won\u2019t provoke national shame like it would in countries where soccer is a matter of vital public importance, but it\u2019s a devastating blow to the millions who hope the sport will get there one day. The run-up to Tuesday\u2019s critical qualifier was dwarfed in the headlines by America\u2019s two most popular sports, the NFL and college football, and the Major League Baseball playoffs. Which meant the match, broadcast in the United States on a channel that no one gets, scarcely moved the needle until it was over. That\u2019s the thing about rock bottom: you never know you\u2019ve hit it until you\u2019re there. Somehow this manages to outplumb the previous nadir of France 98, when the US entered on a head of wide-eyed optimism and promising results \u2013 the second-round finish at the 1994 World Cup, the semi-final run at 1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica, a famous win over Brazil in February 1998 \u2013 only to be thoroughly outclassed by Germany (with Klinsmann delivering the coup de gr\u00e2ce), eliminated in a politically charged tilt with Iran and brushed aside by Yugoslavia to finish 32nd out of 32 teams. No one now or then mistook the United States for a serious player on the international stage, but the baked-in defense for the program\u2019s institutional frailties was a track record of punching above their weight in the big tournaments. The US are one of only eight countries \u2013 along with bluebloods Argentina, Brazil, England, Germany, Mexico, Holland and Spain \u2013 to advance to the knockout stage at three of the last four World Cups. They\u2019ve consistently delivered in their continental championship, winning five of the last nine Gold Cups. They also halted Spain\u2019s 35-game unbeaten streak during a memorable run to the 2009 Confederations Cup final. But it\u2019s clear those periodic successes only served to defer, once and again, an inquest that\u2019s been a long time coming. The signs were everywhere, perhaps most alarmingly last year when the under-23s failed to qualify for consecutive Olympic men\u2019s soccer tournaments for the first time in a half-century, creating a unique scenario where their best players were too young or too old. Collectively, they weren\u2019t good enough. Tearing up the floorboards will be the easy part. Arena out. Gulati out. But the US must address a series of systemic failures and uncomfortable truths in the months and years to come. More money is flowing into domestic soccer and youth development than ever. But for all the talk of Major League Soccer\u2019s hard-won stability, America\u2019s top domestic league appears to have done more for the Caribbean nations than the United States itself. Far more insidious, and alarmingly resistant to change, is the pay-to-play culture that\u2019s made soccer a sport that\u2019s primarily played by upper-middle class white kids. The consequences of missing the 2018 World Cup, which had been entertained in the abstract by American supporters but never quite thought through until Rom\u00e1n Torres\u2019s sensational finish on Tuesday night sealed the United States\u2019 fate, came in a rush. The US team\u2019s next World Cup game \u2013 and this is the best-case scenario \u2013 will take place during Thanksgiving week more than five years from now in the middle of a desert. Teenage wunderkind Christian Pulisic will be 24. Never again will Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard play on the sport\u2019s biggest stage, nor will Michael Bradley or Geoff Cameron. There\u2019s always sadness in an opportunity wasted, but make no mistake: the United States got what they deserved. The only real tragedy will be a failure to accept the invitation for wholesale change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
