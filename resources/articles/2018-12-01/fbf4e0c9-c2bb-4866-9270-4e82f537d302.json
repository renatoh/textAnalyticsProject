During a visit to Northampton, where he was visiting a homeless shelter, Corbyn told a BBC reporter who asked him about the alleged incident, that he had in fact called Conservative MPs \u201cstupid people\u201d for \u201cturning the very serious issue of the failure to negotiate properly on Brexit into a pantomime\u201d in parliament. Asked if this nonetheless constituted not using respectful language, Corbyn said: \u201cI muttered it to myself, actually, in parliament, and you and your colleagues in the media seem utterly obsessed with this. The fact that a homeless man died outside parliament has got no coverage whatsoever, and it should.\u201d Gyula Remes, a 43-year-old Hungarian national who was working as a kitchen assistant, died on Tuesday while sleeping at Westminster tube station, outside the entrance to parliament. The Labour party later released a social media video in which Corbyn made the same argument. News of Remes\u2019s death emerged late on Wednesday, and was covered by the Guardian the same day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
