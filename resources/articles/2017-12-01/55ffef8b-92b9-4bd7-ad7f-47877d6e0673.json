Darbon refused to deny the former Bath head coach Mike Ford is in the frame to take over on an interim basis while Northampton look to appoint a long-term successor to Mallinder in time for the start of the next season. The chief executive, who has been at the club for only four months, did reveal that he received a phone call on Tuesday from Biggar, who arrives next season from the Ospreys on a deal thought to be worth \u00a3650,000 a year, and that he had also sought talks with Mallinder junior. Biggar was at Franklin\u2019s Gardens last weekend as a television pundit to watch Northampton lose 43-32 against the Ospreys in front of only 8,100 people. Darbon said: \u201cI spoke to Dan yesterday, he was here on Saturday, and he is incredibly excited. He saw a disappointing performance from us in a venue that wasn\u2019t full. He is incredibly committed and itching to get here and get on with it. Nothing has changed over the last couple of days.\u201d Harry Mallinder recently signed a new contract until 2020, but while Mike Ford\u2019s departure from Bath in May 2016 precipitated George Ford\u2019s move away from the Rec last summer, Darbon is confident the 21-year-old Mallinder will not look to follow his father through the exit door. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Harry yesterday. As you\u2019d expect, it is a unique situation for him,\u201d Darbon said. \u201cI think he always realised at some point in his professional career he would be playing without his father as his director of rugby or coach. Harry is delighted to have re-signed here and is really looking forward to the future. We were delighted to hear that.\u201d Mallinder\u2019s sacking on Tuesday has led already to a number of expressions of interest for the job but Ford, who is due to take charge of the Dallas Griffins in Major League Rugby in the new year, has emerged as a frontrunner to come in until the end of the current campaign, having taken on a similar role at Toulon last season. Asked about Ford, Darbon said: \u201cA lot of names have been mentioned already. We\u2019re focused on bringing someone in ultimately who can thrive in the conditions here.\u201d The former All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith is another name to emerge and would be a huge hit with the fans following his spell at the club between 2001 and 2004. \u201cWayne is held in massive affection among the supporters of this club and the people that are involved in an operational level,\u201d Darbon said. \u201cWe are at the start of the process so I don\u2019t want to rule anyone out at this stage. We would like to have Jim\u2019s successor in place as we go into next season.\u201d Darbon also insisted Northampton\u2019s financial status \u2013 they announced a first loss in 16 years last April, of \u00a31.2m \u2013 will not prohibit the club\u2019s search, adding he is likely to consult former and current Saints players including the England captain, Dylan Hartley. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone in facing financial challenges as a club, 11 out of the 12 clubs lost money last year,\u201d Darbon said. \u201cI have regular dialogue with Dylan as well as a lot of the senior players. We would be foolish not to elicit some opinion or perspective of those guys. \u201cWe are incredibly lucky here. That \u2018Saints family\u2019 is widespread and I think we would be mad not to talk to, in one form or another, our trusted advisers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
