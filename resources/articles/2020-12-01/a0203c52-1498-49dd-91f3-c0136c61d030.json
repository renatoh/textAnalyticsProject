A Neymar hat-trick in a 5-1 romp meant PSG claimed top spot in Group H ahead of fellow qualifiers RB Leipzig. The indelible moment of the evening, however, came just before kick off when both teams took the knee and raised their fists as the Champions League anthem played. The players were joined by referee Danny Makkelie and his assistants, a new team drafted in to replace officials who are now the subject of a Uefa investigation over alleged racially insensitive remarks that led to both teams leaving the pitch and the tie being suspended on Tuesday. European football\u2019s governing body has confirmed that an ethics and disciplinary inspector has been appointed to conduct an investigation into an encounter involving fourth official Constantin Coltescu, which could see the Romanian banned for a minimum of 10 matches. The incident is said to have occurred after Coltescu recommended the sending-off of Istanbul\u2019s assistant manager Pierre Webo to the referee, Ovidiu Hategan, a fellow Romanian, in the 14th minute. Coltescu is alleged to have pointed out the former Cameroon international to Hategan by saying: \u201cThe black one over there. Go and check who he is. The black one over there, it\u2019s not possible to act like that.\u201d The substitute Demba Ba confronted Coltescu and asked why he described Webo with reference to his skin colour. \u201cYou never say \u2018this white guy\u2019, you say \u2018this guy\u2019,\u201d Ba was heard to say. \u201cSo why when you mention a black guy do you have to say \u2018this black guy?\u2019\u201d Both teams abandoned the field moments afterwards. Under Article 14 of Uefa\u2019s disciplinary regulations, which apply to match officials as well as to players, any individual who \u201cinsults the human dignity of a person \u2026 on whatever grounds, including skin colour, race, religion, ethnic origin, gender or sexual orientation\u201d will be subject to a ban of at least 10 matches. \u201cWebo was really, really sad,\u201d said the Basaksehir manager Okan Buruk after the 5-1 win. \u201cWe supported him, but it was not him who must have felt bad. The culprit is the person who said these words. He\u2019s the one who must be feeling bad. We showed that we were all together with Webo. We must stop this, live together. Humanity is the most important thing.\u201d Buruk also accused the referee Hategan of failing to properly manage the situation after the alleged comments made by compatriot Coltescu. \u201cThe fourth official used an unacceptable word. The referee should have dealt with the situation properly but didn\u2019t. We had to show that we were with Webo,\u201d continued Buruk. \u201cThe players decided to stop. Some of them didn\u2019t want to come back out. We are a team and we had to stick together.\u201d Webo\u2019s red card has been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation and he joined his colleagues and competitors in entering the ground in a \u201cNo to racism\u201d T-shirt. Banners hanging around the empty stadium also expressed the solidarity of Paris fans. \u201cSoutien a M Webo\u2026 fiers des jouers\u2026 against racism,\u201d read one which translated means \u201cwe support Webo\u2026 proud of the players\u201d. The terms and length of the Uefa investigation will be determined by the investigator and have, as yet, not been confirmed. The incident itself provoked a flurry of solidarity, and some dissent, across the football world. The international players\u2019 union, Fifpro, praised the unified actions of the players. \u201cRacial or discriminatory language has no place in our game,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe actions by Istanbul Basaksehir and PSG show players will not tolerate it. Fifpro strongly supports the historic solidarity of the teams in response to the apparent racial abuse.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho said that the match will become \u201cquite iconic\u201d because of the actions of the players. \u201cFor a Champions League game to stop after 15 minutes for a very sad reason, hopefully it will never happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a football guy I am very sorry that the situation happened in my industry.\u201d The Benfica manager, Jorge Jesus, provoked controversy however when he said claims of racism in football were currently \u201cfashionable\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, what was said, but nowadays all this about racism is very fashionable,\u201d Jesus said ahead of his side\u2019s Europa League tie against Standard Li\u00e8ge. \u201cThese days anything that is said about a black person is always a sign of racism, and the same thing about a white man is no longer a sign of racism. It\u2019s a wave that is taking over the world. Maybe there was a sign of racism, but I don\u2019t know what they said to that coach.\u201d The president of the Romanian football federation, Razvan Burleanu, told the Romanian sports news website ProSport: \u201cIf it is proved that we are talking about racism, there will be no understanding on my part. However, we must wait for all the actual details of this incident before drawing conclusions. The intention doesn\u2019t appear to have been to insult, I think that is obvious. The Uefa report will clarify the incident and the measure of guilt for those involved.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
