Januzaj\u2019s spell at the German club was unsuccessful, the 20-year-old failing to make a Bundesliga start. He returned to United at the start of the month and was told then by Louis van Gaal he needed around a week of intensive training plus one reserve game before being considered. Januzaj has now done this and he also scored twice for United\u2019s Under-21s in Monday evening\u2019s 4-0 victory over Southampton at Leigh. Van Gaal\u2019s view was that, as Januzaj returned during German football\u2019s three-week winter break, he needed to regain match fitness. Januzaj scored the winner in United\u2019s 1-0 victory at Aston Villa on 14 August and the manager is hopeful that, with his side continuing to struggle to score, the forward may be able to add creativity and a goal threat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
