Like his friends Four Tet and Caribou, his music has a meditative quality and builds like a late-night set, though Elaenia is in a flock of its own. It\u2019s so tightly wound with ideas that there\u2019s always something new to unravel, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a knotty listen: it builds delicately and almost imperceptibly, until you\u2019re not so much lost in sound as wrapped in it like a fleecy blanket. Nespole gradually intensifies with a restless, sunlit groove and flickering saxophone samples, while 10-minuter Silhouettes (I, II &amp; III) blends tricksy freeform jazz drumming with flashes of swooning strings, creating something urgent and romantic. And each track cleverly slips into the next: even in the middle of chaos that eventually envelopes final track Peroration Six, its droning middle C somehow takes on an emotional significance and pulls you through to the end. Like its namesake \u2013 a lithe South American bird \u2013 Elaenia flits, swoops and soars beautifully, impossible to pin down, let alone cage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
