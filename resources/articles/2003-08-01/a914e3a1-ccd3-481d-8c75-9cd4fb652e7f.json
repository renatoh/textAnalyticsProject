The England defender risks a three-match ban if the Football Association acts over an incident involving Eric Djemba-Djemba in Sunday's Community Shield duel with Manchester United in Cardiff. Campbell was seen, on television, retaliating against the Cameroon midfielder in the 1-1 draw which United went on to win on penalties. No action was taken by the referee Steve Bennett, who sent off Francis Jeffers in a separate incident, but that may not be the end of the matter. An angry Wenger said: \"It is farcical that Sol has been named over that incident. We are living in farci-land. We will fight any charge. What about the challenge by Djemba-Djemba? It was obscene. Why is no action being taken about that? \"Sol was not able to train because of that challenge and he told me he was thankful Djemba-Djemba was wearing rubber studs or Sol could have faced a long time out. The injury is right at the top of his hip. I am very upset.\" Bennett said after the match that he had not seen Campbell's challenge. An FA spokesman refused to speculate beyond confirming that disciplinary action can be taken if the incident is not mentioned in a referee's report. Campbell missed the last three Premiership matches of last season as well as the FA Cup final victory over Southampton because of suspension. Southampton hope to conclude their purchase of Kevin Phillips today, having agreed a \u00a33m fee with Sunderland for the striker last week. Phillips last night appeared ready to accept a significant wage cut to move to St Mary's, where he will be the joint highest paid player on \u00a316,000 per week. The former England international is paid \u00a333,000 a week at Sunderland but knows that a move to Southampton will return him to the Premiership and give him a chance to strike up a successful partnership with James Beattie. The deal would end the manager Gordon Strachan's search for a striker to relieve the pressure on Beattie. Fulham have signed the 34-year-old Wales goalkeeper Mark Crossley from Middlesbrough to fill the gap left by Maik Taylor's loan move to Birmingham City. Tottenham agreed terms with the United States defender Bobby Convey of DC United on the day their manager Glenn Hoddle learned that Guy Poyet would be out for six weeks after breaking a wrist in Sunday's goalless draw with Sporting Lisbon. Burnley have signed the former Blackburn and Manchester United defender David May on a one-year contract while Wigan have bid \u00a31.5m for the West Bromwich striker Jason Roberts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
