In what its governor, Philip Lowe, billed as a \u201cpackage of further measures to support job creation and the recovery of the Australian economy from the pandemic\u201d, the RBA also said it would wade deep into the bond market, buying $100bn of government bonds from banks over the next six months by printing money in a quantitative easing program. The bond purchases would not directly fund the government but would lower the cost of government borrowing and \u201cthe cost of finance for all other borrowers in Australia\u201d, Lowe said on Tuesday. The RBA has also slashed the amount it charges banks under a $200bn loan program, the term funding facility, from 0.25% to 0.1%. Lowe said the dire state of the Australian economy meant people should not expect the cash rate to go up again for three years. He committed the RBA to the \u201cnational priority\u201d of growing jobs and wages, promising to wade into the bond market at an even larger scale if necessary. \u201cThe reserve bank is not out of firepower,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we need to do more, we can and we will.\u201d The move from 0.25% to a near-zero rate follows a second lockdown in Victoria that brutalised the economy of Australia\u2019s second-biggest state and mounting pressure on the bank to do more to support employment. It represents an implicit rebuke to the Morrison government for not spending more on economic stimulus \u2013 something for which Lowe has repeatedly lobbied. Lowe denied any conflict, saying the move was \u201ccertainly not a judgment on the government\u2019s fiscal policy\u201d. \u201cThe government is on the right track and we want to support the government\u2019s effort to get the unemployment rate down,\u201d he said. The move leaves the RBA with no meaningful further capacity to stimulate the economy by cutting rates, although it can continue to pump money into the banking system through quantitative easing. Lowe said by the end of the buying program the RBA would own about 15% of government bonds on issue but, he noted, other central banks owned far more. He said \u201cthe proper functioning\u201d of the bond market was the only constraint on the RBA\u2019s ability to buy bonds. \u201cWe can effectively create money by crediting the bank accounts they have with us, and we can effectively do that without limit,\u201d he said. Lowe said the bank board \u201cviews addressing the high rate of unemployment as an important national priority\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s policy package, together with the earlier measures by the RBA, will help in this effort. The RBA\u2019s response is complementary to the significant steps taken by the Australian government, including in the recent budget, to support jobs and economic growth.\u201d The RBA last moved the official rate at a special coronavirus crisis board meeting in late March when it cut it from 0.5% to 0.25%. Its latest move comes after criticism of the bank for not doing enough to pump money into the economic system to help it recover from the coronavirus crisis, which plunged Australia into its first recession in three decades. The RBA thinks Australia may have stopped being in recession at the end of last month, with growth returning to marginally outstrip the drag on the nation\u2019s economy imposed by Victoria\u2019s woes. But the damage caused to households by the sharp downturn \u2013 especially a high unemployment rate of 6.9% and an even higher rate of underemployment of 11.4% \u2013 does not suddenly disappear with the first green shoots of growth and is likely to persist for months or years after the technical end of the recession, especially if government stimulus such as jobkeeper is suddenly withdrawn. \u201cGiven the outlook for both employment and inflation, monetary and fiscal support will be required for some time,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cFor its part, the board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3% target range. \u201cFor this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently. This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. Given the outlook, the board is not expecting to increase the cash rate for at least three years.\u201d The RBA will buy both commonwealth government bonds and those issued by the states and territories, he said. \u201cThese bond purchases mean that the RBA is now conducting quantitative easing, or QE, similar to that of many other central banks,\u201d he said. Last month the former prime minister Paul Keating criticised the RBA for \u201cindolence\u201d, saying it needed to provide \u201cmountainous sums\u201d of money to finance government spending needed to dig Australia out of its economic hole. Keating called on the RBA to directly finance the government\u2019s spending by buying bonds directly from it, rather than in the secondary market \u2013 an idea Lowe has always rejected. The former prime minister also said that with inflation crushed the bank should pay attention to its other statutory aim, full employment. Inflation is mired at 0.7% and has been below 2%, the bottom end of the RBA\u2019s target band of between 2% and 3%, for three years. Lowe said the RBA would not increase rates until inflation was actually within the band, rather than relying on forecasts as it has in the past. On Tuesday Keating said the RBA had \u201carisen from its monetary slumber and its long, fruitless search for the inflation dragon\u201d. The change to looking at actual inflation should be made permanent, he said. Neither ultra-low interest rates nor the tens of billions of dollars pumped into the economy as part of the Morrison government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis have yet been enough to push inflation towards the RBA target band in a meaningful way. Its inability to spark inflation appears to have caused renewed interest within the bank in its full employment target, which has in the past been regarded as secondary to price stability. \u201cTo be clear, the inflation target remains the cornerstone of Australia\u2019s monetary framework,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cEven so, the priority over the next couple of years is jobs, with inflation risks remaining low. The RBA has a broad legislative mandate for price stability, full employment and the economic welfare of the Australian people. Today\u2019s decision reflects that broad mandate.\u201d The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the rate cut was \u201cgood news for households, good news for small businesses and it will complement what the Morrison government has already undertaken to support job creation across the economy\u201d. But Labor\u2019s Treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said the RBA\u2019s move was \u201ca vote of no confidence in the Morrison government\u2019s handling of this recession and their handling of the budget\u201d. \u201cBy taking these steps the reserve bank has obviously concluded that the Morrison government has not done enough in their budget to support the economy and to support jobs during this very difficult period,\u201d Chalmers said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
