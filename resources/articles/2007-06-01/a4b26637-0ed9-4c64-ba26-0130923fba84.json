There have been times over the past year when David Beckham felt forced to resign himself to the idea that he had played his last game for his country but, as England were welcomed back into the deafening din of Wembley here, so a national icon re-established his credentials on the biggest stage. Victory may have been denied the hosts but the script had always dictated that this would be his night. The contest had lurched into its last quarter when England captains past and present combined to conjure this new Wembley's first senior England goal. Beckham, midway inside Brazil's half, swung over a free-kick which was thumped goalwards and beyond Helton, stranded by the quality of the cross, by John Terry at the far post. The Real Madrid midfielder stood, arms aloft, as his team-mates converged on the goalscorer. Then he punched the air in triumph. Victoria, peering out through designer sunglasses, bounced in celebration with Brooklyn and Romeo in the stand. This may have been his first appearance for England in 335 days but it felt like old times. \"It was fitting that he had a part to play [in the goal],\" Steve McClaren told the media after the match. \"His delivery was exceptional. It was fitting, it was apt, but it was also a pity that we didn't get the result.\" Terry went further, describing his predecessor as \"different class\". There were enough flashes of quality here to damn the management's decision, however political, to ostracise Beckham from McClaren's first nine games in charge. The crowd's gleeful reaction to every mention of the former captain's name may have had the national coach wincing. The ovation granted the Real Madrid midfielder when his name was read out over the Tannoy during the warm-up was ear-splitting - Frank Lampard's, in contrast, was booed - and the applause was just as rapturous when he departed 12 minutes from time to be replaced by Jermaine Jenas. England led and his job appeared done. The upbeat mood was understandable. The national team had rather plodded through McClaren's slipshod reign up to this performance and, even if Beckham had been as disappointing as any other member of Sven-Goran Eriksson's misfiring side in Germany last summer, there was reassurance to be had in the midfielder's presence. There was a commendable diligence, an eagerness to track back and tackle, with his instinctive understanding with the other returning veteran, Michael Owen, very much retained. Twice after the interval Beckham centred for the striker to nod goalwards. Some 12 minutes in the 32-year-old had liberated Owen with a fine angled pass. In his prime the forward would have gathered but, with less than six hours of football in 11 months to his name, he found the pace on the ball too slick. That the pair still combine so coherently gave grounds for optimism, particularly with a more significant occasion awaiting in Tallinn on Wednesday night. Beckham's delivery against Estonia, who will surely sit deep in grim defence, will be vital. Beckham never captained England in this arena. Ray Parlour came on as a substitute for him on the national team's last appearance here against Germany in October 2000, and his best years coincided with England's subsequent nomadic existence. He was initially squeezed out by Fabio Capello at Real Madrid after confirmation that he would join LA Galaxy - put out to seed on a four-year deal worth \u00a3128m - but his resurgence into the club's first team justified his inclusion here. In his 20 appearances as a Gal\u00e1ctico this term he mustered more than 150 crosses, the equivalent of one for every nine minutes played. \"We couldn't have picked him against Andorra because he was injured,\" reminded McClaren bluntly. \"Many people questioned the decision [to leave him out in the first place] and there's been a great debate about it this week, but we picked David Beckham because of what he offers as a player. Certainly since the New Year he's been fit and strong. I've seen that over the last few weeks watching Real and he deserved his place in the squad. After the Spain game [a 1-0 defeat in February] we made a conscious decision to look at him because he was playing well.\" He played just as impressively here. There were constant flashes of just what England had missed since the captain's tearful resignation in Baden-Baden almost a year ago. His first touch, 46 seconds in, had prompted wild whoops of delight in the stands even if he promptly surrendered possession to give Brazil their first foray forward. Yet, if that was down to nerves - this may have been his 95th cap but it must have felt like his first - he quickly found his feet thereafter. The free-kick curled marginally wide of the far post just before the half-hour was a reminder of his pedigree. The delivery was more accurate 68 minutes in and, for 22 minutes, it appeared as if Golden Balls had played his part in eclipsing those in golden shirts. Yet even Diego's late equaliser should not diminish the positives to be had by McClaren and England here. It was good to have him back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
