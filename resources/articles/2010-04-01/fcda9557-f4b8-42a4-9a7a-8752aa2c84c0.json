Great shots, amazing escapes, great swings, bad swings, birdies, pars, eagles, bogeys \u2013 this one had the lot. It even had the intervention of stray catkin, which appeared from nowhere on the second green and landed on the line of a Mickelson putt. The bad news for Lefty, as Mickelson is known, was that his hole-bound ball was knocked off line. The good news was that in the greater scheme of things it did not matter. He simply did not let it matter, hitting a series of shots, not least his approach at the par-five 13th \u2013 off the pine straw, through the trees and on to the distant green, five feet from the cup \u2013 that will live long in the memory. There were a couple of daft shots, too, but that is always the case with Mickelson. It is part of his make-up, his charm. And when the tumult of an afternoon was becalmed the beaming Californian was the winner. \u2022 Richard Wiliams: Westwood comes close but Mickelson reigns \u2022 Bill Elliott: Woods is back on course \u2022 Relive the action from the 2010 Masters His final-round 67, to finish 16 under for the tournament, was enough to beat England's Lee Westwood by three strokes. Westwood, who began the final round with a one-shot lead, was one under for the day and did not play badly; he simply did not play well enough. It was a frustrating day for the pride of Worksop, who has now contended four times in majors over the past two years and come up agonisingly short. Yet he will surely take comfort in yet another fine week on the game's biggest stage \u2013 that and the law of averages. He must surely win one of these things soon. Mickelson now has four major championships, three of them at Augusta, and in doing so moves ahead of Ernie Els and Padraig Harrington, both of whom have won three. As for the man who has won 14 majors, Tiger Woods \u2013 well, once again he proved that, if his private life is complicated, his ambition is not and, despite some swings that resembled a caveman killing his lunch, he somehow knocked his ball around, albeit by a circuitous route, in 69 shots for a tie for fourth at 11 under. As he did last year, the world No1 began his final round with an embarrassing walk from the first tee to the ninth fairway after sending his drive further left than the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Unlike last year, when he escaped the hole with par, he could make only a bogey five. At least he did not delve into his extensive vocabulary of profanity, as he had done the previous day, although his powers of restraint were surely stretched to breaking point over the next few holes as he produced a succession awful shots. On the 2nd hole he took two to get out of a greenside bunker; at the 4th he could not get up and down from just off the green for par; and on the 5th another bad drive led to a bogey. The world's most famous re-affirmed Bhuddist was in a karmically-challenged place, but the mood lasted only as long as it took for his approach at the next to catch a slope at the back of the green and wind an inevitable path all the way into the centre of the cup for an eagle. A birdie at the next, and the next after that, and he was back in contention, even if he was not quite in close enough proximity to the leaders. Not yet anyway. For that he could blame, and those in front of him could thank, the weather which offered up a glorious day, and the competition committee, which leavened the cruelty of some pin positions on the outward nine with a barrow load of kindness on the long walk home. It is always hardest to catch up when others have the opportunity to stride ahead. But if there were birdie chances to be exploited, there was also danger to be found. First to find it was Mickelson, who sent his drive on the 10th deep into the trees left of the fairway, from where his only hope of recovery lay in a gap between two pines about 30 yards ahead. Seve Ballesteros might have blanched but, then again, maybe not. Lefty did not and squeezed his ball back out on to the fairway, about 20 yards short of the green. From there he made a par. It was an amazing moment on a day when amazement was everywhere to be found. Westwood, by contrast, had most of his troubles on the greens, three-putting the 8th and 9th holes and seldom scaring the hole when birdie chances offered themselves. While he kept running to stand still others charged on by. No one did so more thrillingly than Anthony Kim, who was seven shots behind, and four groups in front, of the leaders when the day began. The 24-year-old American has a well-earned reputation for being mercurial but he surpassed even himself on the back nine, which he covered in 31 shots, five under par, and signed for a seven-under 65 to finish in outright third. It was a brilliant effort from Kim but not brilliant enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
