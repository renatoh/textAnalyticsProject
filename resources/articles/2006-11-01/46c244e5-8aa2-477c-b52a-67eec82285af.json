Last year I was living in a one-bed flat and my direct debits were set at \u00a316 a month. British Gas told me they were increasing my direct debits to \u00a332. This seemed extreme, so I figured out how much gas I'd been using, took into account price rises and came up with my own figure of \u00a323 a month. I asked British Gas to set my new direct debit at this price. The lady I spoke to did a sum and after a minute told me it should be just about right. So why on earth were they setting the price at \u00a39 a month more? Her reply was: \"I'm not sure. They always do it.\" It's obviously a way of getting an interest-free loan. I'm sure not many people bother to challenge these amounts, especially those who are more well off, as it is too much hassle to wait for your call to get answered in a call centre. They must be getting a lot of extra money for a period of time. L Woodhurst, via email In July, my monthly British Gas payment was increased by more than 33%. I decided to leave it to see how the outrageous price rises affected me before asking for a decrease. When the bill arrived in October, it showed an overpayment of more than \u00a3100, so I phoned for a refund as clearly the rise had not been necessary. It was patiently explained to me that winter is colder than summer and I may find that the higher payment is necessary after all. I explained that I was not in the business of lending money interest-free to anyone and wanted the money back and the old payment reinstating. I was told that I could, of course, have the money back - it was mine after all - but that the system would then generate an increased monthly payment as I was no longer in credit. I was also told that the operator could not lower the payment by more than 10% - a rule that clearly does not apply to increases. Eventually, the operator agreed to lower the payment by more than the 10% but not as low as I asked for. What chance have we got of paying an accurate, fair monthly payment if each time we get a refund and a new lower payment, the system automatically increases it again as if we were bad payers? L A Hallett, Crewe, Cheshire The answer is simple. Cancel all these \"budget\" direct debits and put the money each month into a savings account. You will then have the satisfaction of knowing that you, not utility companies, are earning interest. If more people did this, these companies would soon change their ways. They rely on financial ignorance. John Wallace, Leighton Buzzard TV Licensing boss adjusts the set In response to the letter (October 28) regarding problems paying a TV licence, I'd like to apologise to Chris Rowbury for any inconvenience. This is not the sort of service we wish to provide to customers. We are aware of the issues and are working as quickly as we can to improve our service. The BBC contracts out the running of the TV licensing call centre to Capita, which is set strict standards by the BBC to ensure that it provides a good service to its customers. We are experiencing an increase in calls and this has resulted in longer waiting times than usual. We would like to reassure customers that more staff are being recruited as quickly as possible so we can get back to the usual response rates. Mr Rowbury also expressed concern about the use of 0870 numbers. At a maximum rate of 8p a minute, and with an average TV Licensing call length of around three minutes, the average call costs 24p, which is less than a first class stamp. Revenue is not made on these numbers, but a rebate generated through their use allows us to keep collection costs as low as possible. For further information, visit tvlicensing.co.uk or contact TV Licensing on 0870 241 5590. Chris Reed, TV Licensing Green Flag loyalty cost an extra \u00a328 I took out car breakdown cover with Green Flag a few years ago. Today I received my renewal notice. The price of \u00a391.35 seemed a bit steep (\u00a312 more than last year) so I went online and was shocked when a quote of \u00a363 for the same level of cover came up. I rang Green Flag and pointed out the huge discrepancy. The person I spoke to said there was nothing he could do and simply advised me to cancel my existing policy and take out a new one online. So much for rewarding customer loyalty. Stephen Mattinson, Steyning"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
