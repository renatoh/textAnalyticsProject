Amid the splendour of the Zofin Palace in the centre of Prague, the Conservative leader signed a grand declaration about the future of Europe with like-minded Eurosceptics. As he signed for Britain, Mr Duncan Smith sat behind a small Union Jack in the style of his political heroine, Margaret Thatcher. While he may struggle to command attention back home, Mr Duncan Smith was treated like royalty when he flew into the northern spa town of Karlovy Vary on board an executive jet for a meeting with the country's Eurosceptic president, Vaclav Klaus. With Czech security guards in sunglasses doing passable impressions of secret service agents, Mr Duncan Smith was ushered into the opulent Pupp Hotel where he rubbed shoulders with film stars in town for the annual summer festival. After a champagne lunch the two leaders emerged, chatting as if they were at a world summit, to join forces to denounce the euro and other integrationist elements of \"Old Europe\". At the end of his day in the limelight, Mr Duncan Smith returned home to the rather less glamorous surroundings of Luton airport carrying the official light blue leather case which marks him out as the mere leader of the opposition. Some of his more wide-eyed supporters will believe that the success of Prague shows their man is destined for Downing Street. Wise heads in the shadow cabinet, who believe such talk is palpable nonsense, do feel that the Tories may at last be starting to turn the corner. Even Mr Duncan Smith's detractors no longer laugh off the idea that he may eventually make it to Downing Street. As with any opposition, the principle reasons for success lie with the government. Tony Blair is experiencing a wretched few weeks where little seems to be going right. There is understood to be deep unease at the highest levels of government that the failure to uncover weapons of mass destruction in Iraq - and the perception that Downing Street overstated the threat in the run-up to the war - is undermining the prime minister's wider credibility. To make political capital out of Mr Blair's woes is difficult for Mr Duncan Smith because of his declaration at the start of the Iraq crisis that Britain should offer \"unconditional\" support for the US. But doubts about New Labour - and Tony Blair's trustworthiness - appear to be benefiting the Tories. This is particularly good news for Mr Duncan Smith because it undermines one of the main arguments of the Portillo faction that the Tories can no longer rely on the \"swing of the pendulum\" as Tony Blair has changed the British political landscape so comprehensively. A few months ago, the accident-prone Mr Duncan Smith could have been relied upon to squander this political advantage. A series of self-inflicted wounds, which culminated in the appointment of the rightwing former MP Barry Legg as his chief of staff, guaranteed that the Tories were seen as an enjoyable, if trivial, soap opera of clashing personalities. In recent months there have been signs that Mr Duncan Smith has learnt his lesson. Mr Legg has left central office and the Tory leader has suppressed his natural instinct to sack or demote some of the Portillo modernisers in the shadow cabinet. In a magnaminous gesture, which he would once have never had the self confidence to do, Mr Duncan Smith brought back the three junior frontbenchers who resigned over Iraq. These wide moves have meant that Westminster journalists, who are ever hungry for stories of splits, have found themselves writing about Tory policies on education and health. In a sign of his growing self confidence Mr Duncan Smith this week decided to address Europe, the deadly issue which has made his party virtually impossible to lead since the fall of Lady Thatcher in 1990. Lest any Eurosceptic fear that Mr Duncan Smith is going soft, they should turn to page five of the speech where he issues a rallying cry for \"New Europe\" to join forces with him to reject the integrationism of the Old European Franco-German axis. Do not be afraid, he told the Czech Republic and Poland, to say no to the euro and to the new European convention. Although he denied it, Mr Duncan Smith's speech amounted to a renegotiation of Britain's relations with the EU, which will leave the hardest of Eurosceptics happy. But the speech was couched in such reasonable language, with none of William Hague's hysterical warnings about a \"foreign land\", that pro-European members of the shadow cabinet appear to be happy. Their assent shows that Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, is now more isolated than ever. Before Mr Duncan Smith had even risen to his feet in Prague, the former chancellor attempted to sabotage his speech by denouncing it as code for withdrawal. Such an explosive intervention, which would once have triggered a bout of speculation about Mr Duncan Smith's future, fell apart because the Tory leader had wisely cleared his speech with centre ground Conservatives, such as the former health secretary, Stephen Dorrell. As MPs wind down next week ahead of the summer holidays, the smart money will be on a government revival when a refreshed prime minister returns from his Barbados break. But he will face a revitalised opponent who, barring a self-inflicted accident, looks like giving him a run for his money up to election day. \u00b7 Nicholas Watt is a political correspondent at the Guardian.
