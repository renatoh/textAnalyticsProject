In October 1916 Irish-born Private Harry Farr was executed for cowardice while serving with the West Yorkshire regiment. Ninety years later an emotional encounter between his daughter, Gertie Harris, and a British government minister started the process of overturning decades of Ministry of Defence policy. For the first time, former War Veterans' Minister Tom Watson has admitted his meeting with Harris in the summer of 2006 prompted him to force the MoD to change policy and grant her father and other shell-shocked troops a pardon. A new book on Irish soldiers 'shot at dawn' for cowardly behaviour in the Great War has revealed it was this 40-minute discussion between Harris and the minister that led to the government pardoning the men in 2006. Talking to the minister, Harris revealed that her family was left penniless and homeless because her mother was not entitled to a military pension. Harris recalled how her father's execution was kept a family secret for decades because her mother was deeply marked by stigma and shame. According to the author, Stephen Walker, at the end of Harris's 40-minute speech on how the execution had blighted her family's life, Watsonhad tears in his eyes and MoD officials who accompanied him were surprised at his emotional reaction. When Harris left Whitehall, Watson turned to his civil servants and said: 'We will have to sort this out.' Until then, successive Labour and Conservative governments had refused to pardon soldiers executed for cowardice. In 1993 John Major rejected the call for pardons, saying it would rewrite history. Five years later John Reid, then a junior defence minister, concluded pardons were not necessary as there was insufficient evidence. However, Watson was so moved by Harris's story that he asked to see the files on executed soldiers. Watson was said to have been 'staggered' that there were more than 1,000 pages of files and notes on the men. 'However, I did read every single piece of paper that was placed in front of me,' Watson recalled. He then pledged to influence his ministerial colleagues to grant men such as Farr a pardon. Watson's tearful response to Harris's story became known throughout the MoD, with civil servants, according to Walker, offering the new minister 'tea and sympathy'. Watson enlisted Des Browne, the Secretary of State for Defence, who also became convinced policy must change. Harris's father was a veteran of the Battle of the Somme and spent five months in hospital suffering from shell-shock. Farr faced a court-martial in the autumn of 1916 for refusing to go back to the front line. His family insisted he had been ill with battle fatigue and had not been given a fair trial. Farr himself was so determined to prove he was no coward that when brought to face his firing squad he refused to wear a blindfold because he wanted to see his killers. All soldiers who faced a similar fate for refusing to fight were routinely blindfolded. Many were given alcohol before being led to the post or chair where they were executed. The campaign to pardon a total of 28 Irishmen who, their families claimed, were shot unjustly and labelled cowards was championed by the Irish government from 2003 onwards. That is ironic, because for most of the 20th century the Irish Great War experience had been edited out of Irish history. Until the early 21st century the Irish state held no official ceremonies marking the sacrifices of 35,000 Irishmen who died in the Great War. But in early 2003 Brian Cowen, then Irish Foreign Minister, announced that the Republic's government would be supporting the 'Shot at Dawn' campaign, which had been established to clear the executed men's names. For the next three years Cowen and later his replacement, Dermot Ahern, petitioned the British government for pardons. When Britain relented and pardoned the men, Watson had already been sacked as a minister after calling on Tony Blair to resign before the 2006 Labour conference. Watson said he first heard about the pardons on holiday in Ireland. 'That night as I watched the television news I saw Gertie Harris and I felt really pleased for her and knew we had done the right thing,' he said. 'I was drinking Guinness, so my wife and I toasted Harry Farr, and my wife turned to me and simply said, \"Well done, love.\"' The book - Forgotten Soldiers - details several cases of soldiers shot for desertion. They include the story of Belfast teenager James Crozier, recruited in 1914 by Colonel Frank Percy Crozier (no relation). Col Crozier assured James's mother in the Belfast recruiting office: 'Don't worry, I'll look after him, I will see no harm comes to him.' Two years later Col Crozier had James executed in France for desertion. The book claims James was also badly shell shocked when he left his billet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
