Representative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who chairs the powerful House oversight committee, asked Carson, the Hud secretary, for information on the allegations by Helen Foster, revealed by the Guardian on Tuesday. Gowdy told Carson in a letter that his committee wanted to \u201cdetermine whether Hud adhered to the applicable spending limitations while redecorating your office\u201d and instructed him to turn over files on decoration work and Foster\u2019s demotion. Foster alleged to a whistleblower-protection watchdog that she lost her job as Hud\u2019s chief administrative last year partly as retaliation for her refusal to exceed a $5,000 legal cap for spending on Carson\u2019s office. She said she was told by Craig Clemmensen, who was Hud\u2019s acting director while Carson went through the Senate confirmation process, to find more money for use by Carson\u2019s wife, Candy, and that \u201c$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair\u201d. Following Foster\u2019s reassignment, the department spent $31,000 on a dining table and accompanying items for Carson\u2019s suite, the New York Times reported. The findings came after Donald Trump proposed billions of dollars in cuts to Hud\u2019s budget, reducing programs for poor and homeless people. A spokesman for Hud, Raffi Williams, claimed that the $5,000 limit did not apply because the table served a \u201cbuilding-wide need\u201d. Williams had previously falsely denied the existence of the table purchase when asked about it by the Guardian. Carson\u2019s department also signed a contract last year to spend $165,000 on \u201clounge furniture\u201d for its Washington headquarters from the retailer OFS Brands of Huntingburg, Indiana, according to federal procurement records. An inventory provided by the department said that the order comprised 38 lounge sofas and 76 lounge chairs. It said 30 of the items were taken from OFS\u2019s \u201cRealm\u201d range, which the company describes as \u201cglamorous, with a beau mondes presence\u201d. Democrats and campaigners from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) earlier on Wednesday urged Hud\u2019s inspector general, Helen Albert, to investigate the allegations made by Foster. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate\u2019s banking committee, said Albert should expand an inquiry that he and colleagues asked for this month after reports on Carson\u2019s involvement of his family members in government affairs. \u201cRanking member Brown believes this should be looked into as part of the comprehensive IG investigation he and other members of the banking committee have already requested,\u201d Ashley Lewis, a spokeswoman for the committee\u2019s Democrats, said in an email. Echoing Brown\u2019s request, Crew said in a letter to Albert that the Guardian\u2019s reporting had highlighted \u201cnew examples of the potentially undue influence\u201d of Candy Carson at Hud and \u201cfurther evidence of Secretary Carson\u2019s apparent disregard for governing rules\u201d. Noah Bookbinder, Crew\u2019s executive director, also cited a separate allegation made by Foster that she was blocked by Hud\u2019s in-house lawyers from handling politically sensitive Freedom of Information Act (Foia) requests that Hud received, apparently because she was perceived to be a Democrat. \u201cIf true, the actions of Hud\u2019s office of general counsel may have been an inappropriate attempt to assert political pressure to affect the processing of a Foia request seeking information that may have placed the agency and high-level agency officials in a negative light,\u201d Bookbinder wrote. The inspector general\u2019s office declined to discuss the requests. Darryl Madden, a spokesman, said in an email: \u201cAs a matter of policy, the office of the inspector general neither confirms nor denies any investigative actions that may or may not be underway.\u201d Tricia Enright, a spokeswoman for the Democratic senator Robert Menendez, the senior Democrat on the banking committee\u2019s housing subcommittee, said the department\u2019s spending was unlike what she experienced while working there for the Hud secretaries Henry Cisneros and Andrew Cuomo during the 1990s. \u201cI don\u2019t recall either one of them demanding the office be redecorated,\u201d said Enright. \u201cThe best you could do was ask for furniture changes from the inventory in storage.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
