Our little hobby looks like it's finally about to enter the big time. I mean, you know you've made it when Lycos has a weblogging system, right? When AOL's system has just been launched? When Blogger has been bought by Google? New weblogging systems seem to be appearing almost daily. Multi-nationals and bedroom programmers are betting that sufficient demand exists for all these new tools. If they're right, the (roughly) one million webloggers today are quickly going to grow in number. But can weblog culture maintain itself under the pressure of several million new contributors? Probably not without help. Many of the so-called problems that people have found with weblogging - unchecked facts, cultural insularity and disparities of influence - haven't really been problems at all. Fundamentally, weblogs don't exist in a vacuum. Weblog readers often segue frictionlessly into being weblog writers, they build up relationships with each other through their sites, they link to and promote people they respect, and they continually fact-check one another. The end result is a culture in which good, insightful articles and writers build up links, respect and visibility - each weblog given context by its membership of the community. But as more weblogs appear, these cultural connections are becoming strained. Groups like the highly politicised \"warblogger\" community have all but split from the contextualising influence of other sites. If we're to find a way to keep the self-policing, self-correcting aspects of our culture then we have to change emphasis from how we write weblogs, to how on earth we read them, filter them, contextualise them - even rate them. The real growth area in the next five years will be in these contextualising tools - the mechanisms that make weblog culture more accessible and accountable. Weblogs have inherited a lot from the structure of the web itself and we already have better checks and balances than Usenet ever evolved. But we need more. A future weblogging culture should be able to find counterpoints to arguments, to identify experts quickly and easily, and it should help good commentary bubble up effectively from new or low-trafficked sites. Mechanisms that help us know who to read, who to trust and who to ignore should be permeating the entire community invisibly and pervasively. Some of these mechanisms are already being developed - desktop newsreaders like NetNewsWire and Syndirella are making it faster to read weblogs, and aggregators like Technorati and Blogdex are starting to find new ways of unearthing good new posts - but there's still a long way to go. We need to start thinking around these issues today because - thanks to AOL - the mass amateurisation of publishing is one step nearer. Finally it's becoming practical for people with little or no technical expertise whatsoever to find their voice. Now we just need ways to make sure we know how to hear them... \u00b7 Tom Coates' weblog can be found at plasticbag.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
