I have an endowment with Norwich Union, which was set up when I purchased my house nearly eight years ago. I did not receive any paperwork for this policy but paid \u00a380 per month. I was a first-time buyer and confused about the mortgage and assumed that the Halifax, who I took my mortgage out with and who set up the endowment for me, knew what was happening. I did not investigate it. About a year or two ago I received a first letter from Norwich Union asking me to fill in a short form to update my details. I completed this and phoned Norwich Union to ask what was going on. It transpired they had been sending my paperwork to my previous address, which had been short-term rented accommodation. The Norwich Union representative admitted they had my current address on file and had sent papers to the previous address in error. They also stated that all the papers should have been sent to my current address, as that was where I had my mortgage and endowment, but they had made a mistake (for six years!). Having never received anything from them before, I asked for copies of all paperwork and the contract I had entered into in the first place. I was informed that \"it wasn't much anyway\". Even so, I asked for copies and was told this would not be possible, but that I would start receiving information from them in future as my records had been updated. I also expressed concern that they had been sending personal financial information to an incorrect address - I was not offered any response or advice. I have since received annual statements and information about whether I might consider making a claim if the endowment was insufficient to reach the amount needed to repay part of the mortgage. I changed my mortgage from Halifax to Nationwide in summer 2005 and the endowment is now a separate entity and I am not relying on it to repay part of the mortgage. However, I am still paying \u00a380 per month and I urgently need help, firstly to know how to go about cancelling the endowment and get the cash back. Secondly, to find out how to put together a complaint and ask for some redress over never having received a contract from Norwich Union in the first place (or subsequently when I asked for one), and not having received statements for the first six years through no fault of my own. I still have not received copies of those missing statements despite having asked for them. Please help. SH A I have spoken to Norwich Union and they are extremely sorry that they \"haven't delivered the high standard of service that you are entitled to expect\", and they are looking into how the mix up with your paperwork came about. They have also written to you explaining how to cash-in your policy. However, this may not be your best course of action, as Norwich Union also stress. Not only might you get back less than you have paid in, but from what you said about being confused about the mortgage, it sounds to me as though you might have grounds for a mis-selling claim against whoever advised you on your mortgage, which according to Norwich Union's records was not the Halifax. More information on making an endowment complaint, as well as practical help on how to go about it, is available in the campaigns section of the Which? website. If your claim is successful you could receive financial compensation, which will essentially put you back to where you would have been if you had taken out a repayment mortgage rather than an endowment. I would advise against cashing in the endowment until you have investigated the possibility of making an endowment complaint."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
