He was often described as the UK\u2019s \u201cmost blacklisted\u201d worker. A bricklayer by trade, Brian recalled \u201cgetting involved in a dispute in Northampton in 1975 with a big firm. Some of the lads asked us to help out and we got involved with the pickets. We won the dispute. But that was what got me blacklisted.\u201d Although blacklisting was illegal, many construction companies vetted workers through a clandestine database that identified union members or activists as \u201ctroublemakers\u201d. Brian said: \u201cI started to see it was getting harder to find work. There was plenty of construction work going on, but I was getting knocked back.\u201d He was without work for more than 25 years until his retirement in 2006. Born and raised in Glasgow, where he studied at St Augustine\u2019s school, Brian was the second of seven children born to Mary (nee O\u2019Neil) and Dan Higgins. He met Helen Cobain in 1966 on a holiday visit to her home town of Rothesay on Bute. They married in 1968 and travelled south to find work, eventually settling in Northampton in 1972. I first met Brian in 1985 when I worked with Helen at a residential home for young adults with disabilities. This was one of the many times of great hardship for the family, supported by Helen\u2019s single wage. Brian divided his time between helping care for his grandson Conor and his role as the local branch secretary of Ucatt (Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians), which is now part of Unite. He often helped to support picket lines and secure victories for many local building workers. Brian took part in the campaign against the blacklist, and gained access to his personal file, which showed how union officials had collaborated with building employers against him and many other construction workers, and how he had been personally targeted by undercover police officers of the Special Demonstration Squad. In 2009, with the Information Commissioner\u2019s office having exposed the existence of the blacklist, Unite was able to gain compensation from construction companies for thousands who had been unfairly denied work. In a motion regretting Brian\u2019s death, the Scottish parliament described him as a \u201cworking-class hero\u201d and claimed that Brian had been denied justice by delays in the various inquiries into the blacklist. Brian\u2019s commitment to justice for building workers was surpassed only by his passion for Celtic FC. He was a great family man and is survived by Helen, their daughters, Monica and Noelle, and three grandchildren, Conor, Dylan and Iris."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
