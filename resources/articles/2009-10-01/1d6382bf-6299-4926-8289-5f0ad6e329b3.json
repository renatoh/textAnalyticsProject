Overall, visits between May and August were 3.4% up on the same period last year, the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva) reports, with some museums and gardens enjoying record-breaking entrances. The National Portrait Gallery in London enjoyed a 23% rise in visitor numbers in June-August compared with the same period in 2008. The gallery said it was boosted by the huge numbers attending the exhibition for this year's BP Portrait award, up 69% on last year. The first prize was won by Peter Monkman for his work Changeling 2, left. Visitor numbers at the Royal Horticultural Society's four gardens \u2013 Harlow Carr in North Yorkshire, Hyde Hall in Essex, Rosemoor in Devon and Wisley in Surrey \u2013 went up by 15% from last year. At the same time, July visitor figures at National Trust properties were 8.3% up on those of the previous July, while August numbers were up 12.1%. Chester Zoo \u2013 one of the most popular in the country \u2013 has already passed the one million visitor mark for 2009, with a zoo spokeswoman saying the attraction was set for a \"bumper year\". The combined effects of the credit crunch and a warm summer meant a record number of Britons opted for a staycation this year rather than going abroad. When asked in February, 60% of Alva attractions predicted that visitor numbers would either stay the same or rise in summer, with many preparing for this increase by offering new family-friendly activities and special deals. Sandy Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: \"The gallery is full of people enjoying the wide range of exhibitions and displays and, following the successful launch of our marketing campaign Take another look, the many works from the [permanent] collection.We have seen a record-breaking summer with the highest figure ever for the BP Portrait award. With Beatles to Bowie: The 60s Exposed and the Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait prize about to open, I am confident that visitors will continue to come and enjoy the gallery.\"The National Trust, hit last year by washout weather and the recession which slashed income from its commercial activities, reported a much better picture this summer. Luke Whitcomb, its member and visitor marketing director, said: \"We're really pleased with this summer's visitor numbers. At property level there's been a real drive this year to focus on the visitor experience. We want to give people the chance to get more involved in our work and provide them with an inspiring and very enjoyable visit.\" Rachael Ashton, PR and media manager at Chester Zoo, said: \"We have already passed the one million mark in terms of visitor numbers and are on course for a bumper year. The fact that more people have chosen to vacation at home this year means they have treated themselves to days out and enjoyed some of the best activities that the UK has to offer \u2013 for us, that has been a bonus.\" Although overseas visitor figures slumped by 9% during the early months of 2009, many attractions reported a rise in foreign patron figures during the summer months. Generally, the numbers of international travellers making visits for leisure are strong while corporate and business travel remain adversely affected by the economic downturn. The 42 members of Alva comprise the majority of Britain's biggest and best-known attractions, and are responsible for managing some 1,598 tourist sites. These attractions typically pull in at least one million visitors a year, Robin Broke, director of Alva, said: \"It is most reassuring to see that the staycation trend predicted by Alva's members has translated into profitable business as it is vital for Britain that our tourism industry thrives, allowing it to maintain employment opportunities across all skill levels and to provide economic growth.\"ends"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
