Benton dismissed suggestions that he was the competition's dark horse \u2013 \"more like a shire horse\" \u2013 in BBC1's ballroom extravaganza, which returns on Saturday night. \"The lovely thing about this is it's not nasty,\" he said on Wednesday after the filming of the opening episode. \"Even though the judges make comments, I think it's a really positive show. It's uplifting when you watch it.\" Talent shows have come in for a spate of criticism in recent weeks, with Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry hitting out at the \"ghastly\" programmes and former Only Fools and Horses star Nicholas Lyndhurst describing them as cruel. Benton said: \"I've always shied away from doing any reality shows and I thought why not, just jump in and have a go. I got excited about it and thought it'd be a bit of an adventure.\" Benton, whose acting credits include Murphy's Law and the Nationwide advertisements, said he would take any criticism from the show's judges on the chin. Asked whether he was this year's Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory politician who became a fan favourite when she appeared on the show in 2010, Benton said: \"I think that's mean on Ann, isn't it?\" Others hoping to win the glitterball trophy this year include the model Abbey Clancy, the rugby World Cup winner Ben Cohen, BBC1 Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid and radio presenter Vanessa Feltz. Dave Myers, one half of the celebrity chef pairing The Hairy Bikers, said being asked to take part in Strictly was like being invited \"to the best party ever\". He said: \"I think this is the only talent show I would do because it's exciting, it's interesting, it's very democratic. There are a lot of very different people in this and no, it's not nasty.\" This year's early favourite is Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley, who bookmakers Ladbrokes have made 4/1 to foxtrot her way to the final. However, Riley was quick to play down expectations because they had yet to see her dance. \"Is there any pressure? Absolutely not. They think just because you're young you should be able to dance but I don't know how,\" she said. Reid, who will juggle weeks of training for Strictly with her duties on the BBC1 Breakfast sofa in Salford, described her first taste of ballroom dancing as nerve-wracking but said she jumped at the chance to be on the show. Her three young sons, however, were less enamoured. \"They had a mixed reaction. They're all boys so they didn't have the 'Wow you're gonna be a princess!' reaction that I might have expected perhaps if I had girls,\" she said. \"I hope they're not embarrassed. I hope I can make them proud.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
