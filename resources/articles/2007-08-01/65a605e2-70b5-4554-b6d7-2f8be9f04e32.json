It was an achievement that sparked not exultation, but relief and revulsion. The relief was felt by Bonds and his family. The vitriol directed at him, as he has remorselessly hunted down his target, has been similar in intensity and disproportion to that which was heaped upon David Beckham after he was sent off against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. And it has been going on not for days, but for years. The death threats, the abuse, the articles - such as one by Jeff Pearlman that started: 'Barry Bonds is an evil man. A truly evil man.' Little wonder his family looked relieved. Now the record is his, maybe the hatred will recede. If it is odd that the breaking of the record should attract such opprobrium, but it is hardly new. When Aaron was on the verge of breaking Babe Ruth's record in 1974, he received 3,000 letters a day, few complimentary, many vile. 'Dear Nigger Henry, You are not going to break this record established by the great Babe Ruth if I can help it... Whites are far more superior than jungle bunnies... My gun is watching your every black move,' being just one. Aaron, of all people, knows what Bonds has been through. His video tribute played on the big screen at AT&amp;T Park was both dignified and well judged. 'I've gotten a lot of calls saying that was the right thing to do and these were from people who know a little bit more about this situation than just the average person,' he said the day after. 'That's the thing that really bothers you. Friends that you've had a long time are all of a sudden coming forth and telling you things like, \"Well, I don't understand, why you aren't making comments,\" or \"Why aren't you doing blah, blah, blah?\" Well, you know what? You're not supposed to understand any of it, because you're not in it. 'I feel tremendously relieved. I'm so glad this is done with and now I can just go my own way.' The bile directed at Aaron was racially motivated, from idiots who couldn't cope with Ruth's record being taken by a black man. Ruth's record was tainted, as it was racked up in the racist decades when baseball was the 'whites only' game that the idiots still wished it was. Bonds, also, divides the country on racial grounds. In a recent poll, 74 per cent of African Americans wanted Bonds to break the record, but only 28 per cent of whites did. He also, and it sometimes seems that the man is a walking embodiment of major talking points, raises the spectre of drugs. Bonds has never failed a drugs test, but the revelations contained in Game of Shadows - in which Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams made a link between Bonds' personal trainer, Greg Anderson, and the Balco scandal - have convinced a huge majority of Americans that he is a steroid cheat. The presumption of innocence has been replaced by an assumption of guilt. As it was reported on satirical website The Onion: 'According to hundreds of thousands of reports coming out of every city in the US, Bonds' steroid use has been widely reported and well documented for years, with sports columnists, bloggers, people attending baseball games, memorabilia collectors, major ballpark popcorn and peanut vendors, groundskeepers, room-mates, significant others, fathers-in-law, next-door neighbours, fellow fitness-club members, bartenders, mailmen, co-workers, teachers, doormen, parking-lot attendants, [and so on at some length....] and random passers-by all having stated at some point in the last five years that Bonds was obviously taking some sort of performance-enhancing drugs.' It is so obvious to so many that it goes without saying. Yet even if Bonds did take steroids, he did so when it wasn't prohibited. To do so wasn't against the laws of the game, let alone those of the land. Compare and contrast with Good Ole Babe knocking back the rye during the Prohibition era. In part, the vicious nature of the loathing of Bonds is down to the fact that he is a reminder of the days when baseball was so arrogant as to assume it didn't have a drugs problem. In part, it is because he doesn't make things easier for himself. Sports writers are irked by people who say little and in so doing fail to write their copy for them. Leave them a blank page and they will vent their frustration. Also it might be a symptom of a general lessening of affection for top sports stars. The more money they make, the more people they employ to protect them from other people, the more detached they become from their fans, the less those fans revere them. The greater the amount of money corporations believe they can make from using sport stars to endorse their products the greater the antipathy felt by those that use the product for those sport stars. The gulf soon becomes unbridgeable and a once-a-generation moment such as happened last Tuesday becomes a source of scorn rather than celebration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
