Price \u00a37.99. Age 8-11yrs In a preface to her new novel, published in the wake of this summer's war in Lebanon, Elizabeth Laird recalls her own experience of life in war-torn Beirut in 1977. This, though, is the story of Ayesha, a young girl whose family, already displaced from their farm in southern Lebanon, are caught in Beirut when the bombs start falling. When her grandmother is taken ill, Ayesha realises that she needs a doctor and medicine - commodities that can only be procured from enemy territory. The account of her desperate journey is a moving portrayal of the plight of children caught up in seemingly senseless wars. Told with only minimal reference to the politics of the war, its themes are universal: human suffering, the irrationality of prejudice and the redemptive power of friendship. Fifty pence from the sale of each book is donated to Save the Children.
