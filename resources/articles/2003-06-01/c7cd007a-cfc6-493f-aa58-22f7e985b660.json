You really couldn't make this up. Today's Uefa Cup preliminary round draw saw MyPa of Finland paired with Young Boys of Switzerland (stop sniggering at the back). Even more incredibly, it also featured Manchester City, back in Europe for the first time since 1979. On paper, City have a draw which even they shouldn't be able to mess up (and yes, we know: this is City we're talking about) against Total Network Solutions from (get ready for the sort of tongue workout you haven't had since you were 13) Llansantffraid in Wales. What price them reliving their Cup Winners' Cup glory days of 1970, when goals from Neil Young (taking time out from playing with Crosby, Stills and Nash) and Franny Lee helped them beat Gornik Zabrze 2-1? OK, perhaps not. It's not such good news for Dundee, however. They could have been paired with minor-league teams from Iceland, Estonia, or Andorra - but were drawn against the Albanian side Vllaznia in what will be their first European game in almost 30 years. \"There is no doubt that this will be an extremely difficult tie for us in terms of the strong opposition, the travel arrangements and the logistics as well,\" admitted Dundee boss Jim Duffy. You don't say, Jim. At the moment the foreign office advises against travel to the north-east border areas between Albania and Kosovo, where Vllaznia is situated, and their website says that \"crime and violence still represent a serious problem in some areas\", pointing out that there is widespread ownership of guns. It also suggests that travellers visiting the area be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B, typhoid and rabies before leaving home.

Today the chase skit was finally concluded as at long last we got an answer to the all-important question the world had been waiting for. \"Mr Ronaldo, sir, who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger?\" Ronaldo thought for a moment. \"A lion and a tiger ... I think the lion. He's the stronger of the two.\" Unfortunately, there were lots of time-wasters at the press conference who wanted to ask stupid questions. Like how he thinks Dave Becks will settle in etc. \"Real Madrid have some difficult and demanding fans,\" yawned Ron. \"I've seen that myself all season, and I think Beckham will have it harder than I did,\" he added with a saucy wink, before bigging up the players threatened by Beckham's arrival. \"I think both Figo and Guti are important,\" continued Ron, who incidentally was wearing white underpants. We asked. \"I think Guti is the player who has surprised me most this season and I hope he continues.\" Meanwhile in Tokyo, Beckham took time out between a facial and having his eyebrows plucked to answer similar questions. \"When you move to a different club it takes a little time to get used to the players and the club,\" he said, attending to a hangnail and making a mental note to book a manicure. \"I hope people give me that time.\" Yeah, anyway, back to Ronaldo. His favourite colour is blue and given the choice between Kylie and Britney, he grinned and said: \"Both. Together. Heh heh.\" Grrr, go get 'em, tiger! * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"He's a big drinker and a smoker, a real nightmare... he's going to be a great player for us. He's a great signing\" - Harry Redknapp on Paul Merson's new Portsmouth team-mate Dejan Stefanovic. * * * * * * * * * * * * IN TOMORROW'S GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER Donald McRae on Vladimir Klitschko Exclusive interview with Barbara Cassani * * * * * * * * * * * * RUMOURS Real Madrid are monitoring Patrick Vieira's contract negotiations with Arsenal and want to get him on a free transfer next summer. In the ongoing Harry Kewell saga, Leeds have turned their attention to Arsenal's Sylvain Wiltord and want \u00a33m as well as the French forward for the Australian. Birmingham manager Steve Bruce will not be signing self-effacing Dutchman Pierre van Hooijdonk. \"Van Hooijdonk is not on my list,\" he said. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Paris Saint Germain president Francis Graille says Real Madrid are still in the hunt for Ronaldinho despite signing David Beckham. However he added: \"Our position remains unchanged regarding this player. For us he stays with PSG.\" Leeds manager Peter Reid insists he knew what he was getting into when he took the job. \"Industries have balance sheets and the results are six months or yearly,\" he said. \"That's the industry we're in. We know the pitfalls and we get on with it.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV1: World Football (4.10am) On the subject of being embarrassed in the company of footballers, we've had this anonymous entry. \"I once interviewed Sol Campbell, who insisted on conducting the interview in the changing room at Spurs Lodge after training,\" begins the mysterious emailer. Channel 5: Confederations Cup - France v Japan (7.45pm) \"The changing room is arranged in such a way that each player has an individual bench, set back between the lockers - so locker, seat, locker, seat etc. Sol sat down on his little bench, which meant that the only way to talk to him for 45 minutes was to sit down on the floor at his feet - from the neighbouring seat I wouldn't have been able to see him. British Eurosport: France v Japan (8pm) \"All was going fine until John Scales emerged from the showers and went over to his locker - right next to Sol's seat. Scales had a leisurely attitude to drying himself; it principally involved standing naked at his locker while he dripped dry. Radio 5 Live: Sport on Five (7pm) \"Had I not been sitting on the floor this would have caused no problem. But you try conducting an interview while a professional footballer's genitalia dangle, disturbingly, a mere eight inches from your face. TalkSport: Football First (7pm) \"To this day, the mere mention of John Scales summons only a vivid and vision-filling image of flaccid member and a pair of balls.\" Newstalk 106(www.newstalk106.ie): Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) It's an arresting mental image, all right.
