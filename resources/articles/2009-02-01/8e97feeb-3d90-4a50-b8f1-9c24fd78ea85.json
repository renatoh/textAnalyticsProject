While President Obama may not count trade among his top priorities, his administration will face growing demands for US leadership on the subject - starting with his visit to Canada today. Although President Obama's instincts appear to favour open markets, he has been largely silent on trade thus far. The administration was conspicuously absent during the debate over trade at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, where leaders reiterated the gravity of the economic crisis and warned against the adoption of protectionist measures. More broadly, the benefit of open markets has been largely missing from the narrative on economic recovery. Given the current focus on domestic stimulus and financial recovery packages, this silence is perhaps understandable. But over the next several months several action-forcing events will bring the debate over trade and open markets to the forefront. President Obama should be prepared to provide leadership on these issues to steady the global economy. With Ottawa as his first foreign visit as commander-in-chief, President Obama will find that Canada has already expressed concern with the \"Buy American\" provisions of the stimulus legislation in Congress, and called on the US to \"resist the pull of growing protectionism\" in a recent letter. Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper is sure to reiterate those concerns and ask President Obama to set an example for the world by ensuring that US recovery efforts do not contain trade-restricting provisions. In April, Gordon Brown will host the next meeting of the Group of 20 nations, at which world leaders are to continue efforts to coordinate global regulatory policies and expand trade. During that meeting, President Obama should look to hold countries like India and Russia to account for recent actions which would seem to violate the pledge made during the last G20 session, in November, to refrain from constructing new trade barriers. Continued backsliding threatens not only a counterproductive trade war but would render meaningless any commitments made under the G20 process. Brown and other foreign leaders are sure to push the Obama administration to work towards a successful conclusion to the Doha round of trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation. While domestic political considerations in the major negotiating countries will ultimately determine whether negotiators can conclude the round, the world will be looking to the Obama administration to play a role in reinvigorating the talks. Days after the G20 meeting, President Obama is scheduled to attend the Summit of the Americas along with leaders who wish to finalise their trade deals with the US. Although pending US free trade agreements may not be high on the US agenda, they are important to the US's allies in Colombia and Panama. Trade will also inevitably surface as the United States plays a more prominent role in the discussions for a post-Kyoto approach to global climate change policy. At home and abroad, the Obama administration will have to help chart a course that protects the environment but does not restrict international commerce. The Obama administration is unlikely to simply react to these outside events and will strive to put a Democratic stamp on trade policy. One probable outcome will be stepped up enforcement actions to hold US trading partners accountable to their international commitments. The president, along with Congress, could also seek to expand trade preference programmes and increase the focus on trade as a means of promoting international development. On the environmental front, the administration could spur an international green growth initiative by negotiating the elimination of tariffs on environmentally-friendly goods and services. President Obama will have multiple opportunities over the coming months to advance a positive vision for the global trading system in this time of economic crisis. Providing strong US leadership internationally and at home will help to ensure that leaders do not make a bad situation worse through protectionist trade policies. As difficult as the domestic debate on trade may be, postponing the discussion is not an option."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
