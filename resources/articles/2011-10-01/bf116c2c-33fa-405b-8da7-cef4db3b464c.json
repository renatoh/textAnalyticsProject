Torres, two games into a three-match domestic suspension, had not scored in the competition since doing so for Liverpool against his current club in April 2009, having endured 875 scoreless minutes before converting Frank Lampard's pass on Wednesday night. His two goals helped Chelsea to a comfortable 5-0 success over Genk. The Spain international's recent displays offer solid grounds for optimism. \"It was never a question of Fernando not being in form,\" said Villas-Boas. \"It's just important for players to feel confident, and he's feeling confident in his abilities now. He was always on form. It would have been a long period off had Fernando not played tonight [given his domestic ban], but we are able to choose from the best up front, whether it's him, Didier [Drogba], Romelu Lukaku or Salomon Kalou. The choice fell with Fernando tonight and he responded pretty well. But I was pleased with the whole team's performance.\" The forward's resurgence \u2013 he has now registered four goals in as many games for his club \u2013 has been welcomed by his team-mates. \"You could see his hunger to be out on the pitch again and scoring goals,\" said the goalkeeper Petr Cech. \"It was just unlucky he couldn't get the third.\" That was denied him by a post in the opening period and a fine save from Laszlo Koteles late on, with Kalou converting Chelsea's fifth from the rebound. Villas-Boas admitted the occasion had been \"comfortable\" against opponents who are struggling badly in their domestic championship. \"This was a game everyone expected us to win, and that's when surprises lie just round the corner. But we had the focus and put in a good performance. With seven points, we go to Genk and securing another three over there would put us in a good position to qualify,\" he said. \"The most important months for us will still be the last three of the season, when you finally collide \u2013 or not \u2013 with occasions where you can claim trophies,\" Villas-Boas said. \"For now, we're just aiming to stay on track in the competition. This group could still become very tight depending upon what happens when Leverkusen go to Valencia [next month], so we still have to show motivation. We will need to be focused on gaining a result in Belgium.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
