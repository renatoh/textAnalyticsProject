Ridsdale is bracing himself for calls for his resignation at the club's annual meeting, despite taking a 36% pay cut this year, and if he stands down Venables will almost certainly pay the price for the club's worst ever start to a Premiership season. As Leeds struggle with debts of \u00a380 million, the team only five points above the relegation zone and a growing number of fans campaigning for Venables to be fired, Ridsdale is expecting a hostile reception when he seeks re-election a week on Friday. There is support among some supporters for Allan Leighton, one of the club's directors and the chairman of the Royal Mail Group, to stand for the chairmanship. Ridsdale is thought still to have the backing of the major shareholders. Nevertheless he is acutely aware that he faces some awkward questions about the club's financial difficulties and the confusion surrounding their proposed new stadium. After unveiling plans last year to move from Elland Road to Stourton, he has changed his mind and wants to build a 50,000-seat ground on the present site. He is also prepared for an interrogation about Rio Ferdinand's transfer to Manchester United - after he had angered shareholders with his repeated assertions that he would \"never\" sell the England defender - and the recruitment of Max Clifford for what the public relations guru has described as \"silly money\", rumoured to be \u00a3120,000 a year. That Ridsdale has taken such a significant pay cut may provide a get-out clause to much of the criticism. He was paid \u00a3383,000 in the last financial year, a relatively modest total compared with the \u00a3600,000 he banked in the previous 12 months. Stephen Harrison, the club's chief operating officer, has similarly felt the effects of two consecutive seasons without qualifying for the Champions League: his annual salary dropped by almost a third from \u00a3326,000 to \u00a3224,000. \"He [Ridsdale] still has his supporters, but I would say he is definitely on the slippery slope,\" said John Boocock, chairman of the Leeds United supporters' trust, which is buying shares in the club. \"It depends how much tolerance the institutional investors are willing to show, but for the smaller shareholders - ie the fans - the confidence in him is diminishing.\" Ridsdale made a point of reiterating his support to Venables after Sunday's 4-2 defeat at home to Bolton Wanderers and, as the man who coaxed him back into management, he is willing to give the former England coach another 10 games to try to resurrect their ailing season. Sources close to Ridsdale say he is determined not to be seen as the man who hired and fired a manager in the space of five months. Indeed, in Sunday's match programme, he made an appeal to the Leeds supporters to give the team time: \"Today's squad boasts some of the finest players in the Premiership and whether home grown or bought by the club, I think these players mean we should look forward with confidence,\" he wrote. \"I understand how the supporters feel. We all do. As a lifelong supporter and more recently as your chairman, I have always tried to do what is right for both supporters and shareholders. This is a tricky balance.\" For Venables, however, support does not appear to be too great elsewhere in the boardroom. If Ridsdale were not to be re-elected or if he decided to stand down, which is possible given the abuse he has received at recent games, the manager would find his position under increasing scrutiny. \"The two are intrinsically linked,\" said one source. \"If the chairman goes, the manager will probably follow. But if Ridsdale stays, Venables will get some more time.\" Once known as \"Publicity Pete\", Ridsdale now tries to keep a low profile and does not intend to comment publicly until after the AGM. But in his programme notes on Sunday he admitted: \"Some [fans] have made it clear they want me to step down.\" Whether they will get their way will become apparent on Friday week. \"My gut feeling is that he will ride out the storm,\" said Boocock. \"Let's not forget he has done some marvellous things for this club. But it would be better if he just admitted he had made a few mistakes; like the stadium move, for instance. Unfortunately he lives in a corporate world, an ivory-towers existence where he doesn't feel the need to apologise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
