How long would it take to discern that this person used to be Ian Paisley? Probably not long. But who is the man known nowadays as Lord Deben? It might take longer to discern in this peer the former Conservative minister John Selwyn Gummer. These are two of the very few recent peers who have maintained a once general tradition of assuming on ennoblement a name more offbeat than the one they were born with. Once those who went to the Lords habitually adopted euphonious names. Talbot de Malahide. Dufferin and Clandeboye. Valletort. Saye and Sele (though the family name in this case was the even more exotic Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes). Viscount Massereene and Ferrard, aka Baron Oriel. Some of these names persist: others have died with their dynasties. But at least since the introduction of life peers, the general practice has been to keep the name you arrived with, while tacking a place name on to the end. Harold Wilson became Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, spurning the chance to become Lord Rievaulx. Labour's former deputy leader, Edward Short, however, a man not normally associated with fantasy, called himself Lord Glenamara, which might have come straight out of Trollope. The former Conservative Welsh secretary, Nicholas Edwards, sits in the Lords as Lord Crickhowell. While the unreformed Lords and unreformed honours persist, could there not be a trace more originality?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
