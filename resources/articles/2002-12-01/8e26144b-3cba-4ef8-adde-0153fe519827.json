Unless we are unlucky we get hooked on stories before we are old enough to ask ourselves why, or to distinguish one kind of story from another. But we tend to remember the old tales of magic (not necessarily fairies) in a special way. They are part of the furniture of our mental attics and cellars. Remembering them is like remembering our first taste of sugar crystals, or avocado, or vanilla. A quiddity of pleasure. We recognise that these tales are endless shape-shifters, within definite bounds. We like to believe that \"our\" version is definitive, and know it is not. We - or at least I - don't like people messing around with them. In The European Folktale the Swiss scholar Max Luthi gives one of the best descriptions of the essential qualities of the tale as opposed to the myth, or the legend, or the authored fantasy for children or adults. He says tales are characterised by \"depthlessness\", a brilliant, abstract mosaic of isolated objects and colours - red, gold, blue, rings, fish, swords, cauldrons - and an assumption that their world is the whole world, though it is recognisably not the world we inhabit. They make, he says, \"a provisional view of humankind and the world as a whole\". Like a fastidious princess picking out peas, he sieves the Grimms for sentences about characters' emotions which are \"written\" sentences, literary, nuanced by moral or psychological tweaking. I like his account because it corresponds to my ancient memories of struggling with the precious atmosphere created by Perrault, or the contrast between the Grimms' occasional sanctimoniousness and their matter-of-fact bloodiness - or worst of all the sense of violation I felt from the sado-masochistic manipulations of the Master, Hans Andersen, who set me against Christianity before I could think clearly about it. All the great collectors of folktales, from the Italians, Basile and Straparola, through Perrault to the Grimms, introduced authorial voices and habits of mind. There was cross-fertilisation - the Grimms were told Perrault's tales by German women who knew them as folktales - and revision and adjustments for propriety or charm. Jack Zipes and Maria Tatar have both made scholarly collections - The Great Fairy Tale Tradition and The Classic Fairy Tales respectively, both Norton Critical Editions. Maria Tatar has now edited one of the most sumptuous coffee-table books of tales I have ever seen, also for Norton. I wondered at first who were its intended readers. It mixes folk favourites - Russian and Scandinavian and English with Perrault and Grimm - but adds five authored tales by Andersen. It has a wonderful array of illustrations from Cruikshank and Dulac to Walter Crane, Kay Nielsen and many more. It has footnotes and variants of some tales and parts of tales, biographies of writers and illustrators, and an excellent bibliography of further reading. It is not as useful to the seriously curious as Tatar's primarily scholarly works - she is one of the most acute commentators now working. It is at first sight too scholarly even for enterprising children. But it does contain almost all the tales which haunted me from my wartime childhood and it is a thing of beauty. It has a magically shimmering cover that changes from puce to gold as you turn it, and is satisfactorily, simultaneously ancient and modern. A perfect present for a serious-minded child, or curious adult. The \"depthless\" matter of fairy tales has been squeezed into all kinds of shoes and rings, stuffed down chimneys and minced into sausages by commentators, elaborators and disintegrators. Catherine Orenstein, in Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked, takes a sociological, psychological and cultural-studies canter through ancient and modern versions of that story from Victorian moral tales to S&amp;M fetishism, from Tex Avery's Red Hot Riding Hood to Matthew Bright's 1996 movie Freeway in which cool Vanessa shoots the bandit Wolverton with her boyfriend Chopper Wood's gun, taking in the extreme female poem by Anne Sexton in which the riding hood is a Linus blanket, red as the Swiss flag or chicken blood. Reference is made to Bettelheim's heavily determined Freudian readings of fairy tales, to mythographers seeing sunrise and sunset as red, to lycanthropy and Susan Brownmiller's views of the tale as a paradigm of rape and indoctrination into female victimhood. Orenstein reproduces advertisements for Max Factor lipstick and James Thurber and Quentin Blake's knowing little girls. Why is all this depressing rather than amusing or informative? Partly at least because Orenstein, like most of her cited texts, takes an automatic cultural-studies attitude to the tale and its nature. It has been made up by \"society\" and it has designs on us - which change as \"society\" changes, from primitive sexual indoctrination to complex feminist messages, satire and consumer jokes. We know better than the Victorians. We are enlightened by \"subversive\" and \"revisionary\" readings. Orenstein accepts the assumption that Red Riding Hood and Cinderella were originally role models - and largely accepts the modern assumption that heroines of tales were passive, sweet, instruments of male fates and objects of male desires. Tatar asks one of the pertinent questions about that: why have we taken to our hearts Cinderella in the ashes, rather than the resourceful Donkeyskin, who is escaping the incestuous desires of her father? Angela Carter wrote great, modern, authored fairy tales because she wrote them out of her own fantasies (or so she said). She was always indignant at the idea that the world of folktales offered no images of resourceful females - and if she added a few of her own, like the heroine's mother who rides in to Bluebeard's castle on a carthorse, she did it with verve and sinister pleasure. She was never a role-model maker, either way. Alison Lurie has said more than once that Disneyfication has made magical tales - in Luthi's sense - inaccessible to the American imagination. Both Disney, the revisionists (including the satirists) and the commentators have tended to snuff out the life of the tales that once scuttled and slithered through our minds. Voices have been raised against tales - the Dutch novelist Cees Nooteboom, comparing them with myths, said that they were lies and simplifications, \"a false longing for the writing of myths\". His quarrel is mostly with Hans Andersen, who did combine a dangerously enchanting approximation to the narrative necessity of fairy tale with a coercive personal and religious message. Terry Pratchett invents imaginary worlds, and feeds off other imaginary worlds, but he doesn't like fairies, from tooth fairies to gnomes. Carter herself, in the introduction to the Virago book of fairy tales, says that even in Perrault's day there was a sense that popular culture belonged to the past - \"even perhaps, that it ought to belong to the past, where it posed no threat, and I am saddened to discover that I subscribe to this feeling too; but this time it might just be true\". For Carter, the world of earthy dreams and forest dangers has been superseded - whether we like it or not - by video culture and soaps. Academic discussion of Disney's reworking of Cinderella or Snow White is stodgy compared to reality television's The Bachelor, where a single Harvard graduate has to choose between 25 lovely, healthy young women, in boats, on horseback, in snow and mudbaths. Diane Purkiss's Troublesome Things (2000) is about the borderline between fairyland and reality in old tales of changelings and modern sightings of the creatures at the bottom of the garden. She too finds the vitality of the other world in virtual realities - internet true stories of space abductions, the return from the dead of Princess Diana and Elvis. Perhaps we have killed the old tales with saccharine and dissection. But Tatar's delicious volume opens magic casements on to dark forest paths all over again. \u00b7 AS Byatt's most recent novel is A Whistling Woman (Chatto)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
