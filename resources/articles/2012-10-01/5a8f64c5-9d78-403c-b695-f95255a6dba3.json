But having taken four gongs \u2013 including performance honours for its lead actors and the coveted prize for best drama \u2013 the second season of Homeland will also face the highest expectations when it premieres on UK screens this Sunday. This second season opener is almost low-key, marking less the start of a new Homeland adventure, more the next chapter in the one we'd already been following. Its protagonists remain tightly coiled and unpredictable; balanced right on the edge. But viewers don't get the luxury of a gentle run-up as characters are re-established: it's full throttle almost from the very off. When we last saw Sergeant Nicholas Brody, the feted US Marine held captive by al-Qaida for eight years, and Carrie Mathison, the not-so-feted CIA agent convinced of his involvement in an al-Qaida plot, both were close to self-destruction. (Admittedly, one in a more literal way than the other). Both characters' appeal lies in their complexity and indeterminability, and, as the show's trademark strains of jazz fade over the title credits, viewers are reminded why they were so gripped by the pair's faltering dance across the first season. Damian Lewis and Claire Danes are magnetic on screen, and their performances more than stand up to a repeat outing: Brody quietly calculating, Carrie with her emotions writ large. The second series picks up not too far from where we left them: having submitted to electroconvulsive therapy, Carrie is focusing on her mental health; finding peace through routine and gardening. The marine who sent her over the edge, meanwhile, is forging ahead with a political career. The season one finale left some \u2013 including me \u2013 doubting whether Homeland's storyline could believably stretch to further outings, and also left the writers with the problem of their own making: creating a storyline that could feasibly include both characters. The result is unsurprisingly some rather ham-fisted plot-wrangling. Meanwhile, big questions from last series still hang unanswered, while equally large new ones are introduced. The background to this second series is the Israeli bombing of Iranian nuclear plants, with action returning to the Middle East for scenes that underline Homeland's power as a classic spy drama. It could be as much George Smiley disappearing into a doorway as one of the show's more modern operatives. As Saul Berenson (played excellently, once more, by Mandy Patinkin) drops a jaunty hat on to his head and slips into the shadows, there can be few spy-genre fans who don't cheer. But there is also the Brody family to bring into play, and it appears as though Brody's daughter, Dana, may be given a larger role this series. Good news for those who admired Morgan Saylor's performance was as the sulky teen with typically stroppy attitude issues \u2013 she more than deserves the screentime. The danger, of course, is that things become too syrupy. Not that this packed first episode is giving too much away. Fans will find themselves back in that state of Homeland nervous excitement, sitting a bit too upright on the sofa, fingernails in palms. Quite where all the intricately laid layers of plot will lead, will be doubtless the topic of fevered discussion \u2013 but, on past form, few correct predictions. Homeland starts on Channel 4, Sunday 7 October at 9pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
