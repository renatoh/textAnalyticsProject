My results weren't good enough for the offers I held so I got in through clearing and the courses available were not really what I wanted. Rhys, London Having conditional offers was good for me. It made me work hard to achieve the grades I needed. If application had been after A levels I might have coasted. Steph, Leicester It would be much better knowing your results first. I got better grades than I expected - way above what was needed by the course I was going for. By then it was too late to change so I ended up taking a year out so I could apply for more suitable courses. Carol, Edinburgh The application period is far too early and not just because you're unsure of results. At the point when you have to apply many students are still uncertain about what they want to do and would benefit from a bit more time to work it all out. Joan, Manchester I wanted a year out but applying for deferred entry didn't result in the right offers so I applied after results. It was good because I knew straight away if I was going to fulfil the entry requirements. Also it was very ego boosting to get five unconditional offers.
