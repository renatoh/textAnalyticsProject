In Scotland we do not have a localism bill but communities here would share that view. He also mentions the difficulty of reaching decisions on issues where the inputs cannot be quantified in terms of monetary value. These may well be those issues which are of great concern to communities, such as the long-term health and vitality of a town centre. Having participated in many planning appeal inquiries over the past 20 years I have been struck by the degree to which decisions so often rest on the factors such as turnover, access and expenditure. Developers' teams of lawyers, planners, traffic consultants and retail specialists grind out the statistics. Communities, even if they can make up their collective mind, do not have the security of such clearly stated positions and may be regarded as standing in the way of progress in expressing a contrary view. The consequence of limiting the discussion in this way can be to elevate short-term gratification through a new supermarket above the longer-terms considerations which communities hold dear. Market forces prevail. Andrew Robinson Director, Robinson Associates \u2022 \"Sometimes I need a philosopher,\" says Simon Jenkins. I am a philosopher, so here goes. Jenkins writes about village politics and the difficulties of resolving clashing aims and values. My suggestion: we need a new conception of rationality which recognises that when we have problematic or disputed aims, ideals or values we need to represent them in the form of a hierarchy, so that they get less and less specific and substantial, and so less and less problematic and likely to be disputed, as we go up the hierarchy. In this way we can create a framework of relatively unproblematic, undisputed aims, ideals or values (and associated methods), high up in the hierarchy, within which much specific, substantial, problematic and contested aims or values (and associated methods) can be assessed, debated, and perhaps improved in the light, in part, of experience. Such a hierarchical conception of rationality, designed to help us improve problematic aims and values as we live, ought to be built into village, national and international politics, into industry, agriculture, finance, media, law, education and even science.
