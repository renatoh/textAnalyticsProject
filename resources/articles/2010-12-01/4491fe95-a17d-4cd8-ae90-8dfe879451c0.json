Creepy claustrophobic for a bit, it dissolves quickly into suspenseless drift \u2013 not all of it coherent. Grant is a dusty academic with a pervy crush on his stressed research student (Laura Fraser). She appears to be mid-way through a meltdown, hearing voices in the empty flat upstairs. Or is someone messing with her head: Grant maybe, her flighty little sister, or shiftless rocker boyfriend? Watching Cuckoo is something like overhearing a conversation in Dutch: for a nano-second it seems to make perfect sense; then with a jolt you release you haven't understood a word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
