You become very spoilt when it comes to beaches. I remember how disappointed I was the first time I saw Malibu. But aside from Australian beaches, the best beach I've ever seen was in St Lucia, between the two famous grand pitons or lofty rocky peaks. Thank heavens it's now been declared a Unesco World Heritage site. I've seen many gorgeous beaches, but for sheer drama that one probably wins. I've never found my ideal travelling companion... My husband [Billy Connolly], whose performing life necessitates a great deal of travel, prefers to stay home when he's not working. I'd like to find a Joseph Conrad reincarnation with whom I'd stride off into Unknown Lands. Yes, it's romantic nonsense, but I've really got a passion for adventure. Of course, Joseph would have to be an expert scuba diver, non-smoker, culturally sensitive, eco-aware, no pets, hilarious and gay. Is there anyone out there? I never travel without... Moisturiser. God, you should see what a wizened old crone I am after a Sydney-London haul without it. The thing I hate about travel is... When you don't get the chance to see the local people and places. You start seeing the world through airport lounges. I can't bear to have a transit stop at some interesting place I've never been. It's sad, but when I hear the words 'Kuala Lumpur' I now see only nylon carpets, grid lighting and a two-for one-special on giant Toblerone. My top travel tip is... Take your own pillow. My idea of paradise is... A gorgeous, unspoilt reef with warm water where I can dive. The reefs off Savu Savu in Fiji come to mind, as well as those of the Tuamotus Islands [in French Polynesia]. My last trip was to... Indonesia, aboard my sail boat, where I was searching for clues to find out what happened to my great-great grandfather. He and his trading ship disappeared between Lombok and Sumbawa in 1821. My favourite hotel is... The Ritz Carlton in Jimbaran Bay, Bali. Gorgeous, Balinese-style cottages with private pools and gazebos, with the best spa in the world, overlooking the ocean. When I arrived, I walked into the bathroom and they'd run me a rose-petal bath. It was so decadent I actually felt guilty and had to talk myself into climbing in. My most memorable meal was... On a tiny lagoon beach on a small island in Kiribati when I was retracing Robert Louis Stevenson's travels with his wife Fanny for my book Treasure Islands. Our local hosts, Hina and friends, caught massively plump coconut crabs and roasted them on a beach fire.It rained, so we huddled beneath a lean-to and gorged ourselves. \u00b7 Pamela Stephenson's latest book, Murder or Mutiny, is published in hardback by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson at \u00a320. \u00b7 For more tales from the road, and to suggest his next destination, see Mike Carter's blog"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
