Last month the Guardian revealed that the driver of the two-man non-emergency G4S ambulance crew told his colleague that \u201cbeating a patient to a pulp\u201d was preferable to \u201cbeing beaten to a pulp\u201d, even if they were prosecuted. His colleague suggested that to do so would simply result in a six-month suspension while they were investigated. The two-man crew were immediately suspended when it was brought to G4S\u2019s attention. The driver of the G4S vehicle initially left a message saying the crew would be a few minutes late to take him to William Harvey hospital in Ashford, Kent. But he failed to complete the call correctly, and the crew\u2019s conversation was recorded on the voicemail. \u201cHe\u2019s homeless, he\u2019s aggressive, he\u2019s suicidal, so he ain\u2019t gonna be the best, is he?\u201d the driver was heard to say. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take him if you don\u2019t feel safe with him. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got the fire extinguisher. Take it off the hook now and you\u2019ve got something to hit him with. You\u2019d rather be prosecuted, wouldn\u2019t you, for beating a patient to a pulp than that patient beating you to a pulp, wouldn\u2019t you, as a choice of the two?\u201d The driver continued: \u201cD\u2019you want a broken arm, a broken jaw, black eyes, or do you want to beat the fuck out of someone and then get prosecuted? You could still say it was self-defence.\u201d His colleague added: \u201cAnd get suspended for six months while they check up on it.\u201d The driver concluded: \u201c[At] least you\u2019re able to sit in your garden. You wouldn\u2019t be able to get into your garden with a broken leg, would you?\u201d The 43-year-old patient, who asked not to be named, had not been picked up by the two crew members before and has no history of being aggressive towards G4S staff. He said the message left him distraught. The story led Conservative MP and former health minister Dan Poulter to say that \u201cthe suitability of G4S as a provider of important public services in the NHS and elsewhere needs to be urgently reviewed\u201d. Norman Lamb, a Liberal Democrat former health minister, called the recording \u201cdeeply shocking\u201d and said: \u201cIt raises the question as to whether G4S can be trusted to deliver humane, decent and effective services to vulnerable people.\u201d On Thursday the patient received a letter from the G4S general manager, Tom Maidman, explaining the employees had been sacked following an investigation. \u201cI would like to express how deeply sorry I am that you have been subjected to such an incident and what you experienced is inexcusable,\u201d Maidman said. \u201cI would like to emphasise that the behaviours the individuals displayed were not in line with the company\u2019s core values and standards and do not reflect the rest of the hard-working staff employed by G4S. \u201cThe type of behaviour displayed on the day in question will not be tolerated in any part of our business. I can confirm that the individuals involved are no longer employed by the company. Please accept my sincerest apologies for any distress the incident may have cause you.\u201d The patient told the Guardian that despite the two men being fired, he does not feel justice has been done. \u201cThis has caused me huge distress \u2013 and continues to do so. I still don\u2019t understand why these men were not charged with threatening behaviour or under the Malicious Communications Act. If they had been charged at least they would have been named and shamed. As it is, they retain the privilege of anonymity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
