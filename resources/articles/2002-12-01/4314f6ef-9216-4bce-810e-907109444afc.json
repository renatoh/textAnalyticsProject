He started the Inflation Report and press conference process that has done so much to bolster the institution's credibility after Black Wednesday a decade ago. He oversaw the independence process and took the central role on the monetary policy committee. King joined the Bank from his job as a professor at the London School of Economics. 'I did not intend at that time to stay at the Bank for more than three years. Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 changed all that,' he says in the Bank's PhD economist recruitment literature. Now he will be charged with bringing Britain's burgeoning housing market boom to a soft landing. Yet he has said he does not recognise words like 'boom' or 'bubble', and 'does not want to get into a pulpit' on the matter. He has a stronger awareness of how newspapers work than a good many journalists. But he was also a serious academic. A look back at his published papers is interesting. The Chancellor's sense of kinship was no doubt boosted by King's Endogenous growth and the role of history, published in 1989. Gordon Brown was much mocked for using the phrase 'neo-endogenous growth theory' in a speech before he became Chancellor. 'Pigovian rules' for public sector provision, and a limited role for tax policy in the reduction of inequality, would not sit well with the thrust of new Labour policy these days. But King is a master of concluding everything or nothing. Newspaper headlines following his speeches can often be entirely contradictory. He has pioneered the idea that the Bank of England should not pretend that it knows what is going to happen to the economy, to house prices, or indeed anything at all. Instead, it should offer up a set of consistent principles, and the way in which it will react to economic news. It should also set out a central forecast around which there are upside and downside risks. These risks are quantified as contours of probability in the Bank's fanchart presentations. The tabloids have recently come to describe King as the 'Dr Doom' of the British housing market. This paradoxically decisive equivocation is well complemented by a light presentational touch. 'It is too soon to compare the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee with the Council of Nine that ruled Siena during the fourteenth century,' he said in a recent speech. He has immersed himself in the history of the Bank, often peppering his speeches with obscure, though entertaining, bits of historical trivia. He has referred to the central role that a wind vane used to play in Bank decisions. The right wind would mean more ships arriving at London's docks and therefore require the Bank to prepare to issue more credit. King also referred to the famous eighteenth century Gillray cartoon that shows William Pitt the Younger, the then Prime Minister, ravishing an old lady whose dress was made of pound notes. Pitt's government had demanded gold from the Bank to pay for war against the French. The cartoon gave rise to the Bank's Old Lady monicker. From next summer, King can look forward to one of the job's ceremonial benefits - venison culled from Richmond Park and Hampton Court, courtesy of the Queen. The Governor receives two haunches of venison from Her Majesty every year. He is not to be confused with the championship winning darts player by the name of Mervyn King. But he is every bit as keen on hitting his target."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
