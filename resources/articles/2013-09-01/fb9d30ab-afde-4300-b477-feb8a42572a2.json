Well, now's your chance. Over the next few weeks, visitors to the British Film Institute will be able to watch some of Satyajit Ray's best work: Days and Nights in the Forest, The Chess Players, Company Limited, The Home and The World. What makes them so good? Partly his collective of collaborators: extraordinary actors such as Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, the cinematographer Subrata Mitra. But his greatest films are marked by an ability to depict realistic situations \u2013 the hopelessness of a graduate's job hunt, say, or the hardships of life in a Bengali village \u2013 and remain alive to both their political and aesthetic dimensions.
