The tyrant and the oligarchy have convinced many voters the reason they feel powerless and economically insecure isn\u2019t because the oligarchy has taken most of the economic gains and overwhelmed the government with its money. It\u2019s because the country has been taken over by undocumented migrants, Latinos, African Americans and a \u201cdeep state\u201d of coastal liberals, intelligence agencies and mainstream media. This is rubbish, of course, but the tyrant is masterful at telling big lies and he is backed by the oligarchy\u2019s money. Imagine further that the opposition party will soon face another election in which it could possibly depose the tyrant and overcome the oligarchy. But at the rate they are consolidating power \u2013 over the courts, politics and the media \u2013 this could be the opposition\u2019s last chance. What would it do? Would it allow virtually anyone to seek to be the party\u2019s candidate for president (and gain valuable brand recognition along the way), including spiritual gurus, one-issue entrepreneurs and minor elected officials who have never even run for state office? I doubt it. The party would establish criteria to filter out those who had no real chance. Would it let almost every one of them go on television to debate one other, thereby placing a premium on one-line zingers, fast talk and rapid-fire putdowns? Would it assign them randomly to one of two nights, so several candidates with the most support would not even get to debate one other? Of course not. Instead, it would take the half-dozen who had the best chance and structure the debates so they could demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the forcefulness of their ideas in lengthy back-and-forth exchanges. Would it encourage them to split the party over policy issues that almost no one understands, such as the meaning of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d, thereby causing some voters to become alarmed about a government takeover of the healthcare system and others to worry the government won\u2019t go far enough? No. It would encourage the candidates to emphasize the larger goal, in this case to provide health insurance to everyone, and have them explain that a so-called \u201cpublic option\u201d to buy into Medicare would eventually displace for-profit private insurers anyway, because it would be so much cheaper. Would it let any of this deflect attention from the tyrant keeping children in cages at the border, coddling foreign dictators and inviting them to help him in the next election, shattering alliances with other democracies, using his office to make money for himself and his family, lying non-stop, subsidizing fossil fuels and downplaying climate change, claiming the media is guilty of treason, and undermining other democratic institutions and norms? Of course not. Although it would want its candidates to float some ambitious and sensible proposals that would get people hopeful about the future, it would also want them to keep attention on what the tyrant was doing and the dangers he posed. Finally, given the extraordinarily high stakes in the upcoming election, would it decide on its candidate in much the same way it has done in the recent past \u2013 solely on the basis of who can attract the most primary voters and caucus attenders? No. It would have its eye on the general election. It would be thinking strategically about how to attract voters in places the tyrant won in the last election but could swing back. In America, that would be Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina. This doesn\u2019t mean it would support a \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201ccentrist\u201d candidate. These terms mean little in a land succumbing to tyranny and oligarchy. It would do best with a candidate able to create a multiracial coalition to fight the tyrant and his oligarchy \u2013 a coalition combining poor, working class and middle class whites, blacks and Latinos. It would need a candidate who could explain how the tyrant uses racism and xenophobia to divide and conquer, turning the majority against each other. A candidate who could help people understand that a necessary part of fighting tyranny is fighting racism, and a requisite for fighting inequality is reversing climate change. A candidate who could unite the country around an agenda of robust democracy and shared prosperity. This may sound fanciful but the challenge is real and the Democratic party must meet it over the next 17 months. What may be fanciful is that today\u2019s Democratic party has the power to select its candidate in the ways I\u2019ve suggested. Yet the stakes in the 2020 election are larger than any election in living memory. The Democrats\u2019 selection of a candidate therefore is no ordinary thing. In a very real sense, the fates of America and the world depend on it. The question is whether the Democratic party is up to the task.
