The Muslim cleric denied inciting hatred against Jews and other \"non-believers\" and told the jury that the Qur'an said racism was wrong, and he \"condemned it\". He denied prosecution claims he had incited his listeners to carry out murders in the UK or abroad in sermons he gave between 1997 and 2000. Before he took the stand, Mr Hamza's defence lawyer told the jury that the defendant was a victim of \"exaggeration, innuendo and fantasy\". Edward Fitzgerald QC said Mr Hamza, 47, was \"probably the most frequently abused and ridiculed figure in this country\". Mr Fitzgerald told jurors they must consider the evidence alone and not the way Mr Hamza, of west London, had been the victim of \"misrepresentation\" in the media. Some sections of the media \"may have convicted him before the trial began\", Mr Fitzgerald said, but it was the jury who had heard the evidence. Mr Hamza denies all charges including nine of soliciting murder and one charge of owning a book which the prosecution claims is a \"terrorism manual\". Today, during questioning from his QC, Mr Hamza said: \"If you are a scholar you will never distinguish between anyone of any colour. Racism is one of the greatest sins. I actually condemned it. We have been told to hate it as wrong, even if it comes from our own fathers, we have to denounce it.\" Earlier, the barrister said the defendant, who has no hands, had been called Captain Hook, Hook, and Hookie in some newspaper reports. Phrases such as \"Hook off, Hookie\" had been used, Mr Fitzgerald said. He said Mr Hamza had been accused of supporting Saddam Hussein when he had in fact \"denounced him as a tyrant\". Mr Fitzgerald had told jurors that much of what Hamza had said in his talks were religious sermons which he preached from the Qur'an, copies of which were handed out to the jury. He said Mr Hamza had never urged anyone to emulate suicide bombers. His references to Jews were in a historical and religious context, the barrister said. \"He is not anti-Semitic.\" Mr Fitzgerald said the Qur'an had references to the duty of jihad, which means a spiritual and sometimes physical struggle, and that all of the speeches referred to oppression of Muslims throughout the world. The QC said: \"He was not urging or seeking to persuade anything of a specific nature which could even begin to be interpreted as soliciting murder.\" Mr Fitzgerald added that Mr Hamza was referring to matters abroad. \"He says there is nothing you can do here ... He says Afghans have to do it in Afghanistan, Pakistanis in Pakistan.\" Asked whether he urged people abroad to murder people, Mr Hamza, who was wearing a blue shirt with his arms tucked inside pockets, said: \"The concept of murder: no. The concept of fighting: yes.\" One of the charges facing Mr Hamza, relates to the possession of the Encyclopaedia of Afghani Jihad, which the prosecution say is a \"manual for terrorism\" and includes suggestions for targets, including Big Ben. But Mr Fitzgerald said there was only a single paragraph reference to Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower as potential targets in the 10-volume encyclopaedia. He said this had not stopped one newspaper running a headline: \"Hook's Big Ben Bomb Book.\" Mr Fitzgerald said: \"That is the kind of exaggeration and misrepresentation by the media. It is ridiculous that because you have one reference in a five-thousand page document in your house you are planning to bomb Big Ben.\" He said the book was produced at the time of the Afghanistan-Russian conflict and had been a military manual that \"is now described as a terrorist manual\". He said that if you had the Encyclopaedia Britannica in your house and there was a chapter on torture in it, it did not mean you were planning to torture. Mr Hamza said he was born in Egypt in 1958 and spent his early life there before moving, aged 21, to the UK in 1979. He took an engineering degree at Brighton Polytechnic and in 1989 took up a job as a civil engineer at the Sandhurst Royal Military Academy. The court heard that Hamza was responsible for maintaining the fence and a variety of buildings. Mr Fitzgerald asked the defendant whether he had kept drawings of the academy after leaving the job, and he replied: \"Yes.\" He said police seized the diagrams when they searched his house in 1999, but later returned them. When they searched his property again in May 2004 they did not remove the documents, the court heard. Mr Hamza said that in the 90s he went to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bosnia. He said he planned to move to Afghanistan permanently but returned to the UK after he lost his hands in 1993. He has married twice and his second wife is a British national, the court heard. Mr Hamza told the jury he had helped foreign Islamic groups, but had never condoned violence against children or women. He said: \"I wrote a book to distinguish those who do jihad and those who are hiding behind jihad.\" Earlier today, as the prosecution ended the presentation of its case, the court heard that a total of 181 items were seized from Mr Hamza's home by a dozen police officers in a pre-dawn raid. The seized items included a number of recordings of his speeches. Mr Hamza faces nine charges under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 alleging that he solicited others at public meetings to murder Jews and other non-Muslims. He also faces four charges under the Public Order Act 1986 of \"using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with the intention of stirring up racial hatred\". A further charge alleges Mr Hamza was in possession of video and audio recordings, which he intended to distribute to stir up racial hatred. The final charge, under section 58 of the Terrorism Act, accuses him of possession of a document, the Encyclopaedia of the Afghani Jihad, which contains information \"of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism\". The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
