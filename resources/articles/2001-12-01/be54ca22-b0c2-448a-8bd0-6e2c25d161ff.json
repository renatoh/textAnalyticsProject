What rescues it from monotony is the liveliness of his writing, as he produces telling examples of politicians relying on dodgy statistics and sets out the obstacles to measuring health, education, business success, national economies and quality of life. Even more rewarding are his sidebars and interludes - 10 Counting Paradoxes (eg \"the more you measure, the worse things get\"), and profiles of figure-fixated reformers from Bentham to Keynes. A Magick Life: A Biography of Aleister Crowley Martin Booth (Coronet, \u00a38.99) Magician, mountaineer, traveller, drug experimenter, prolific author and priapic bisexual, Crowley was an icon for the 1960s counterculture. Booth's intelligent biography is less bewitched, coolly separating demonic myth from mundane fact as he chronicles an odyssey through 1890s London, the Himalayas, the Highlands, Paris, New York and Sicily. Sensibly, he takes Crowley's accounts of magical rites at face value, without crudely rubbishing them; but the bald, fat, smelly, permanently impoverished Beast's improbable success as a seducer is handled with an enjoyably dry sense of humour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
