The shadow chancellor used an election campaign speech in Liverpool to outline the economic priorities of the party, and said a Labour government would change the fiscal rules so borrowing for investment would be excluded from borrowing targets. McDonnell, who said his programme was \u201cin the best tradition of British socialism\u201d in the footsteps of Hugh Dalton and Gordon Brown, also promised to shift significant political decision-making power from London to the north. He said much of the planning for investment would be devolved, that part of the Treasury would be moved to the north of England and that his ministerial meetings would be held in other places as well as London. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that the centre of political gravity is shifting away from London. It\u2019s coming back home to the north.\u201d Speaking soon after the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had announced that the Conservatives would revise their own fiscal rules to be able to spend an extra \u00a320bn a year on infrastructure, McDonnell said far greater ambition was needed. As well as \u00a3250bn in investment over 10 years for a green transformation fund to invest in areas such as clean energy and home insulation, Labour also pledged \u00a3150bn over five years for what it billed as a new social transformation fund. This would be spent on infrastructure projects, such as schools, hospitals and social housing, to \u201cbegin the urgent task of repairing our social fabric that has been torn apart by the Tories\u201d, McDonnell said. McDonnell urged voters to ignore Conservative pledges of more spending. \u201cThey treat us all with contempt,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think people are stupid. That with Brexit on the agenda, they think we\u2019ll all forget about the past 10 years and the prospect of the next five years if they get back.\u201d The election was \u201ca once-in-a-generation chance to get back on track\u201d, he said, with the focus on the climate emergency and crumbling social infrastructure. Asked after the speech whether the amount pledged could spook money markets and lead to interest rate rises, McDonnell said: \u201cOur scale of investment matches the scale of those emergencies that we now face, on climate change and socially. I\u2019ll tell you, if we didn\u2019t set off on that march, future generations would never forgive us.\u201d McDonnell insisted that any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour would not affect the spending plans if it was eventually endorsed by a second referendum: \u201cWhatever deal we seal will enable us to go ahead with our programme.\u201d He said fully costed spending and investment plans would be spelled out in Labour\u2019s manifesto, and that cheap and plentiful government borrowing made the programme realistic. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage at the moment of demand for government bonds across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cOur aim as a Labour government is to achieve what past Labour governments have aspired to: an irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people. \u201cThat means change, real change. It means investment on a scale never seen before in this country, and certainly never seen before in the north and outside of London and the south-east. \u201cTo achieve that objective also requires therefore an irreversible shift in the centre of gravity in political decision-making, as well as investment in this country, from its location solely in London, to be relocated to the north and regions and nations of our country.\u201d Spending would be guided by a national investment bank, with a series of regional arms, he said, with \u201cdecision-making devolved down to local communities\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
