During a Zoom call with around 60 northern Conservative MPs on Monday evening, the prime minister described devolution as \u201cTony Blair\u2019s biggest mistake\u201d. While Downing Street later stressed that the remarks referred to Scottish National party mismanagement, Johnson\u2019s comments will be seen as especially provocative with support for Scottish independence showing a sustained lead in polling throughout 2020, and ongoing frustration from both Scottish and Welsh governments at a lack of communication from Westminster during the coronavirus pandemic. Blair, the prime architect of devolution, delivered his 1997 manifesto commitment to hold referendums, with Scotland and Wales voting for their own parliaments, and unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland forming a power-sharing coalition following the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, responded on Twitter saying: \u201cWorth bookmarking these PM comments for the next time Tories say they\u2019re not a threat to the powers of the Scottish Parliament \u2013 or, even more incredibly, that they support devolving more powers. The only way to protect &amp; strengthen @ScotParl is with independence.\u201d Johnson called the MPs from Downing Street, where he is self-isolating after coming into contact with an MP who later tested positive for coronavirus, as he tries to \u201creset\u201d his leadership after a turbulent year from coronavirus and in-fighting at No 10. The Tory MPs he spoke with are part of the Northern Research Group (NRG), which formed over concerns coronavirus lockdowns were unfairly damaging the north of England. Referring to expectations that the departure of aide Dominic Cummings last week would signal a less abrasive Conservative administration, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, tweeted: \u201cOh dear oh dear so much for the new softer respectful approach, well that has not lasted. [Johnson\u2019s] attitude explains the power grab of the internal market bill, devolution to be dismantled our Parliament under attack. We can stop his wrecking ball, it is called independence.\u201d Ian Murray, Labour\u2019s shadow secretary of state for Scotland, insisted that \u201cdevolution is one of Labour\u2019s proudest achievements\u201d. \u201cThis confirms that Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t believe in devolution and would put the future of the United Kingdom at risk. His government should have been working in partnership with the devolved governments during this crisis. Instead, people across the UK have been paying the price for his failings.\u201d Scottish Labour\u2019s Anas Sarwar, who returned to the Holyrood shadow cabinet on Monday as shadow constitution minister, tweeted: \u201cBoris Johnson has been a disaster, not devolution. The truth is he is biggest threat to the United Kingdom. In the midst of a pandemic, when people\u2019s lives &amp; livelihoods are at risk, both our Govs should be focusing on bringing people together &amp; getting us through this crisis.\u201d One Tory MP on the Zoom call, who said Johnson labelled MPs in the NRG his \u201cpraetorian guard\u201d, told the Guardian: \u201c[Johnson] was on fantastic form, he took the entire meeting standing up. He was very animated, bouncy. He was clearly not a man in poor health. He said he wants us to open up as much as we can on the 2nd of December but that we had to recognise that [coronavirus] was a dangerous, nasty illness that we needed to get under control. \u201cHe said there are two ways: the continuing rollout of mass testing, secondly, of course, the vaccine. He said we needed to get the vaccine into as many arms as possible. \u201cHe was very positive about the economy of the north and fully understood the need to level up. He was particularly upbeat on transport and electronic infrastructure, calling them the great equalisers.\u201d A Downing Street source did not deny Johnson had told MPs that devolution had been a disaster in Scotland. \u201cThe PM has always supported devolution but Tony Blair failed to foresee the rise of separatists in Scotland,\u201d the source said. \u201cDevolution is great \u2013 but not when it\u2019s used by separatists and nationalists to break up the UK.\u201d The source said the prime minister had said that leaving the EU \u201cmeans we must strengthen and protect the UK economy with the [internal markets bill]\u201d. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, who has spoken out against Westminster policy on a number of occasions since his election in July, appeared to partly contradict Johnson, saying: \u201cDevolution has not been a disaster. The SNP\u2019s non-stop obsession with another referendum \u2013 above jobs, schools and everything else \u2013 has been a disaster.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
