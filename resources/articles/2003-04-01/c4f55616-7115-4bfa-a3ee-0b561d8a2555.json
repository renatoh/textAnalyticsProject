I'm still on cloud nine. I'm so pleased for everyone - especially our manager, Neil Thompson - and it's one in the eye for all those critics who said we didn't deserve to be in the Third Division because of the contract irregularities. We've been labelled cheats but we've dug in and we're staying up on merit. Two successive wins meant our fate was in our own hands so we took the game to Macclesfield and it was great that Matt Hocking's first goal of the season won it. He's one of our unsung heroes, an absolute brick. There were big hugs all round in the dressing room afterwards as the champagne flowed. I was voted player of the year in my first season when we were relegated from the Conference 10 years ago so when I had an inkling that I was up for it again I started encouraging supporters to vote for anybody but me. I was worried that if I won again we'd go down again, but all's well that ends well. Admission prices were cut to a fiver on Saturday to say thank you to our fans, and nearly 4,000 responded. We must end this season in the way we want to start in August so we'll be looking for three points at Cambridge on Saturday. I'm still in talks with the club about a new contract. Everybody knows where my heart lies; I don't want to go anywhere else and I hope we can agree on a two-year deal to give me a nice bit of security. The landlord of my local has been having a friendly dig at me all season but I think I've finally won him over. On Saturday night, alongside my picture he's had up on the wall was the message \"Staying up! Superman!\" Nice compliment but just a little over the top. As a keeper, I work in six-yard boxes rather than telephone boxes - and I never wear my pants outside my shorts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
