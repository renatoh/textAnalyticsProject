Inside was an invoice, payable to the Cook Islands Golf Association. We owe them NZ$1,140 (\u00a3444.60), the cost of flying out a golf professional from New Zealand to give lessons for a couple of weeks, says Duncan Weir, the governing body's director of golf development. The R&amp;A have a little golf tournament at Turnberry to organise over the next few days but the Cook Islands Golf Association can rest easy. The R&amp;A's cheque will be in the post. It always is, and with ever increasing frequency, as Weir, armed with some of the profits accrued from the Open Championship, goes about spreading the gospel of golf. His department has an annual budget of \u00a35million, but don't ask him where the money goes. Spend a little time with an atlas instead. China, India, Uruguay, the Cook Islands (of course), Malaysia, Laos, Nepal, Estonia \u2026 the list goes on and on. \"I suppose the ideal scenario would be to look up one day and find a golfer from Estonia in the final group of the Open Championship,'' Weir says. \"But I guess we won't see that happening for a while.\" The man from the R&amp;A is probably right but it would be unwise to write off in perpetuity the prospect of the Claret Jug heading back to Estonia in the luggage of a player whose interest in the game was sparked courtesy of coaching lessons funded by the proceeds of next week's Open. After all, golf is a global game now. Those inclined to disagree with this bold declaration might care to take a look at the final leaderboard of the 1977 Open at Turnberry, in which Tommy Horton of England, tied for ninth, was the only non-American inside the top 10. Tom Watson won 32 years ago. The chances are that this week's winner will also be an American, Tiger Woods, but the prospect of the chasing pack featuring only his fellow countrymen is so remote as to be almost laughable. Kenny Perry has a chance of winning, and those in search of an \"insider's\" pick could do a lot worse than Brian Gay, but beyond that golf's perennial superpower is looking rather bereft. This, it might sensibly be argued, is a reflection of the declining quality of American professional golf (as opposed to the golf being played on the PGA Tour) but it is also a reflection of the long-term shift in the balance of power within the game. \"For that, I think you thank the likes of Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo,'' says Ken Brown, the former Ryder Cup player who is now a member of the BBC's commentary team for the Open. \"Before those two came along, it was as if the Americans were untouchable. [Arnold] Palmer, [Jack] Nicklaus, Watson \u2013 these guys were gods. You couldn't touch them. All of sudden, you had Seve \u2013 a Spanish player from a very humble background \u2013 and Nick, a nerdy loner from Welwyn Garden City, and they were beating the Americans regularly. That gave players outside of America a lot of confidence, a sense that, hang on, these guys aren't gods after all.\" But if the great Ballesteros and the nerdy Faldo were trailblazers, they he did have some institutional help in breaking down the barriers. The introduction of the world ranking system in 1986, which provided a week-by-week evaluation of players from all around the world, was hard for tournament organisers to ignore. \"Before the rankings came along, you would have really good European players \u2013someone like Gordon Brand Jnr \u2013 who would never play in major championships and really good American players \u2013 someone like Dow Finsterwald, who captained the American Ryder Cup team in 1977 \u2013 who would never play in the Open. That would never happen now. Tournament organisers want the strongest fields possible, and that means having the best players in the world play, whatever their nationality'' says Weir. This is largely true, but not entirely so. Until recently, the Masters had an eccentric, or rather American-centric, view of what constituted a major championship field. The same might be said of the Professional Golfers' Association of America, who run the PGA Championship, the fourth major of the year. These days, the top 100 players in the world rankings receive an automatic invitation to the event, but for far too long the field was cluttered with the great, the good and the not-so-good of American club professionals. To their credit, the R&amp;A have always had a global outlook when it comes to the Open Championship. Looking back to 1977, there were players from 15 nations in the field. This time around, there are 27. This is a reflection of the growth in the game, at least at the highest levels, in places like South America, which provides two genuine contenders this week in Argentina's Angel Cabrera and Camillo Villegas of Colombia. But it also the result of the introduction of International Final Qualifying in 2004, an innovation that offered players in five continents an opportunity to qualify for the Open without leaving home. So it is that Mark Cayeux of Zimbabwe and Jaco Athers of South Africa \u2013 first and second in IFQ Africa \u2013 will make the trip to Scotland this week. Likewise Gaganjeet Bhullar of India, the winner of IFQ Asia. It would require a vivid imagination to think that any of those three will step up to receive the Claret Jug next Sunday afternoon, but there is nothing wrong with that. The coming four days in Scotland are about more than simply identifying a winner. This is the Open Championship, after all \u2013 with the emphasis on \"open\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
