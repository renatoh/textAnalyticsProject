In an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s political podcast, Butler says Labor\u2019s commitment to reduce emissions by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030 is a \u201crock solid commitment\u201d, not an \u201caspiration\u201d or \u201csomething that would be nice to achieve\u201d \u2013 and he says voters are more agitated now about climate action than he has ever seen during his time as an MP . Butler says the Morrison government is lining up to deploy \u201ctired old scare campaigns\u201d about carbon taxes in the coming campaign \u2013 with Scott Morrison this week characterising the measures this week as a \u201cBorat tax\u201d \u2013 \u201cbut what I see as I get around the country after a very angry summer \u2026 the hottest summer we have ever had \u2026 is Australians are sick of it\u201d. He argues voters are in a mood to punish the Coalition if the government defaults to wrecking and hyperbole over the coming weeks. \u201cThe consciousness, the level of expectation for this building, for the Australian parliament to do better on climate change is greater than I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 I think it\u2019s greater than it was in 2007. \u201cPeople are increasingly seeing the impacts of climate change, they are seeing the urgent clear advice from scientists that this is a climate emergency. \u201cWe have to stop having these petty political fights. We need to stop responding to Tony Abbott\u2019s playbook and actually start putting some serious policy in place.\u201d Butler indicated Labor would pursue as much of the policy, outlined this week, as it could without triggering \u201ca drawn out legislative battle\u201d \u2013 meaning by regulation, and by working within existing mechanisms \u2013 and he predicts the Greens will be punished by their supporters if they refuse to support Labor\u2019s climate policy on the basis of insufficient ambition. The Greens outlined its own climate policy before Labor to define some of the boundaries of policy ambition post-election, and have already signalled they could torpedo one element of Labor\u2019s climate plan \u2013 allowing heavy polluters to use international permits to meet their emissions reduction targets. Butler says that is a backflip on the position the Greens took during the implementation of the carbon price in the 43rd parliament. \u201cThey supported [the use of permits] when we were last in government, it was a central feature of the clean energy package they signed up to \u2026 but now, apparently, that\u2019s an abomination. \u201cI think there is a lot of politics going on.\u201d He said if the Liberals lost the coming federal election, and Abbott lost his seat, that could create the conditions for the Liberal party to come back to the table on climate change, and he predicted if the Greens shot down the policy on the basis it wasn\u2019t perfect, \u201cthat would be an extraordinary decision, frankly, for the Greens to take\u201d. Butler said the Greens voting with Abbott against Labor\u2019s first climate policy mechanism during the last period in government was one of the factors in shattering the political consensus at the federal level which has prevented policy action for the best part of a decade. The shadow climate change minister says Australia has now lost five years, with emissions rising when they should have been falling. \u201cIf Labor is elected at the next election, I think the gravity of responsibility of the next parliament to do something here should not be under-estimated. \u201cIf the next Labor government is not allowed to make serious changes in this area, I hate to think where Australia is going to be in 2030. \u201cI hate to think of the scale of betrayal to our children and grandchildren if, for politics, our government, if we are elected at the next election, is prevented from implementing this policy.\u201d Labor\u2019s policy involves boosting the existing safeguards mechanism to impose more stringent pollution reduction standards on heavy emitters, and imposing a new pollution regulation on car retailers \u201cin line with\u201d 105g CO2/km for light vehicles, which will drive the uptake of electric vehicles. The specific timeframes for implementation are not clear in the policy document released this week, and Labor has refused to release a carbon budget making transparent the specific levels of emissions reduction it is factoring in in each sector of the economy. Butler acknowledges that Labor will face lobbying from politically influential stakeholders on its climate commitments if it wins the coming election, but he insists the changes will be implemented, pushback or no pushback. He says a key difference between now and when Labor was last in government is a substantial shift from investors, regulators and lenders to a world where carbon emissions are now considered \u201ca key investment risk\u201d. \u201cEmissions reduction is now no longer an option. Emissions reduction is now a must do for emissions intensive businesses.\u201d Butler says he would like to remain in the climate portfolio in the event of an election win, but adds whether he does is a matter for Shorten \u2013 and he repeated his personal opposition to the controversial Queensland Adani coal mine. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a case for opening up a new thermal coal mine.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
