The England left-back will have a scan today but initial indications suggest he may struggle to be fit for the start of the new season next month. \"Bridge brought the problem from the last game with the national team, tried to train but he wasn't feeling good. He's in the hands of the medical department and we will have to make a decision on his future,\" said the Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. Bridge was being supervised by the club's medical staff at the Beverly Hills Hotel, with the possibility remaining that he could require an operation. Chelsea's first-choice left-back, Ashley Cole, is still regaining fitness after undergoing surgery, but should be fit to play in pre-season friendlies once the club return from their US tour. Cole has yet to train with the rest of the first-team squad here for their four-team World Series of Football tournament. Chelsea's season proper begins against Manchester United in the Community Shield on August 5. The former Bolton Wanderers defender Tal Ben Haim, normally a centre-half, could play at left-back if required."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
