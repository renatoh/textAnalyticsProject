They were part of a small community of German Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution who settled in Rochdale, Lancashire. George was born in Neum\u00fcnster, northern Germany, the elder son of Hannah (nee Feldman), who had been a portrait photographer before her marriage, and Martin Abendstern, an industrial chemist. His father worked for the Jewish leather manufacturer Adler and Oppenheimer and when they established the Lancashire Tanning Company in Rochdale, he was one of the employees transferred to the UK. Sanctuary from the horrors of Nazi Germany was qualified: one of George\u2019s early memories of Britain, perhaps firing his lifelong sense of injustice, was of his father being arrested by the police after the second world war began and interned in nearby Bury as a so-called enemy alien. Martin had suffered from TB and was shortly afterwards released due to his poor health. At 15 George started work as an apprentice at the engineering firm Mather and Platt in Newton Heath, Manchester, progressing to draftsman and later to technical author in a lifetime career that he loved. The atmosphere of the shop floor could not have been more different from the world of his refugee family, and he recalled being both overwhelmed and excited by it. It was there that his politics crystallised and he became an active trade unionist and committed communist. In 1952 he married Jacqueline Shotton with whom he had two children, Jeanette and me. Their marriage ended amicably in 1977 and in 1980 he met Linda Clair, his partner in life and politics for the next 39 years. George also became father to Linda\u2019s two daughters, Julie and Beverley. From the mid-1980s, as a result of Linda\u2019s report of her experiences when visiting Palestine for the first time, George identified as an anti-Zionist and together they campaigned tirelessly for the rights of Palestinians. It was vital to him that people should understand the difference between antisemitism (which he considered racism) and anti-Zionism (which he defined as criticism of the Israeli state). George was also a peace campaigner and was bookkeeper for Greater Manchester CND for many years. Although politics took centre stage for George, he also had a rich cultural and social life and a wide range of interests, including mill engines, classical music and cooking. He loved hiking and cycling in the Pennines and the Lake District, canal boat holidays in Britain with family and friends, and Greek island hopping with his beloved Linda. He was deeply attached to Rochdale, feeling hefted to its industrial heritage and landscape. He was a man of great charm and style, warmth and humour, an activist who refused to stand by when he witnessed injustice. He is survived by Linda, his four daughters and seven grandchildren."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
