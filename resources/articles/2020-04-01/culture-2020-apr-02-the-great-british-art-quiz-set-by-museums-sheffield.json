Each day, a different collection will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Museums Sheffield, a charity that cares for the city\u2019s collections of art, history and natural science. Its art includes British and European pieces from the 16th century to the present day, as well as works that directly illustrate the city\u2019s history. Its strength lies in the modern British collection, which includes artists such as Frank Auerbach, Vanessa Bell, David Bomberg, Gwen John and Stanley Spencer. You can see art from Museum Sheffield on Art UK here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
