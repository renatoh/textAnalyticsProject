I\u2019m routinely lost in the middle of London. My journeys tend to consist of a hard stare at a map app, 50 paces in the wrong direction and then a kind of abject sustained fumble until I arrive at wherever I\u2019m supposed to be 10 minutes after I\u2019m supposed to be there. And that\u2019s me with Google Maps. Without Google Maps, I\u2019m 80% sure I would have given up and moved into a ditch some years ago. However, this time is different. Gooley, often known as the Natural Navigator, has got me lost on purpose. He\u2019s covered my eyes and led me by the arm through the backstreets of central London, taking time to spin me around every now and again for maximum disorientation. And now, right in the middle of nowhere, he\u2019s asked me to take him to one specific Oxford Street branch of Wasabi. \u201cRemember what I said,\u201d he tells me. I look up. The sun is directly in front of me, throwing all manner of shadows in my direction. It\u2019s lunchtime, so that means I must be facing south. The clouds, too, are lazily drifting from west to east, just as they were last time my eyes were open. I tentatively make my way towards the sun and, miraculously, I find myself on Oxford Street. Then I follow the clouds eastwards and, bingo, I\u2019ve got to where I need to be. Weirder still, it wasn\u2019t even that hard. This is the message of Gooley\u2019s new book Wild Signs and Star Paths. It\u2019s a beautifully written almanac of tricks and tips that we\u2019ve lost along the way, with the intention of helping us regain what he calls the \u201csixth sense\u201d: our innate ability to scan the landscape and anticipate what might happen next. \u201cThere are potentially 11m pieces of information hitting our brain every second,\u201d he tells me as we cross London, \u201cbut our brain filters out 99.9% of it.\u201d Simply by being more attuned to this information, Gooley can spot things that have managed to pass the rest of us by. For instance, had I got lost on the way to Wasabi, I could have looked up for the nearest satellite dish. Why? Because satellite dishes overwhelmingly point southeast. Notice this once and you\u2019ll never be able to unsee rows and rows of satellite dishes, all quietly informing you of your place in the world. Gooley\u2019s motto is \u201cNothing is random.\u201d He\u2019s parsed the world in minuscule detail and located the pattern holding it all together. He\u2019s part Spider-Man and part Neo from The Matrix, albeit much more affable and with a niftier taste in hats. He argues that he\u2019s just managed to hone abilities we all latently possess. \u201cMy tuppence-worth is, I think, humanity consistently makes progress and then throws the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had thousands of years of wanting to get from A to B in the most expedient way possible. But now we can get between places incredibly efficiently, and people have realised that they go from A to B to C to D to E to F to G to retirement to death, without actually noticing what they\u2019re doing at those points at all.\u201d If nothing else, his ideology is an antidote to that. It\u2019s reminiscent of mindfulness in that sense; by slowing down and concentrating on every tiny sensation that the present offers you \u2013 the feeling of wind on your face, little noises you\u2019d otherwise tune out \u2013 you can start to uncover new layers of understanding. However, there is a caveat. \u201cI never made the argument that this way of thinking of the world is expedient,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are very few situations where natural navigation is the fastest option.\u201d Walking around London with Tristan Gooley is a copper-bottomed reinforcement of this notion. Every few paces he\u2019ll halt to enthuse about some aspect of the landscape that has somehow passed the modern masses by. In Seven Dials he stops me to point at a tree, marvelling at what he calls \u201cthe tick\u201d \u2013 the shape caused by its subtle lean southwards. In Soho Square he takes me through a blow-by-blow deconstruction of a holly tree, showing how the lower leaves are spikier than those higher up, and that its north-facing leaves are slightly but significantly larger than those to the south. He simultaneously explains the enormous difference in meaning between one and two pigeons taking off from a lawn at the same time. It\u2019s mind-blowing stuff \u2013 granule by granule he\u2019s constructed an intricate jigsaw puzzle of information that perpetually lets him know where he is and what\u2019s going on \u2013 but if you need to get somewhere sharpish, it probably isn\u2019t for you. \u201cNavigation was the only thing that held my interest for more than a couple of years,\u201d Gooley explains over tea in a Covent Garden caf\u00e9 midway through our jaunt. As he gained more experience, it led him to bigger goals. He\u2019s led expeditions around the world, travelling to far-flung corners to study the methods of the Tuareg, Bedouin and Dayak. He is also the only living person to have both flown solo and sailed single-handed across the Atlantic, a feat that helped remind him of his mortality. \u201cYou know you\u2019re at the edge of sensible endeavours when more than half the people you\u2019ve talked to have died,\u201d he says. \u201cI went to seven people for advice on the aviation part and, by the time I took off, three of them were dead in light aircraft crashes.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI think a fourth died subsequently.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until that escapade was over that Gooley felt the bite of natural navigation. \u201cIt was really weird,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d have this major experience of climbing into a boat and sailing through gales and all sorts of challenges, and then a week later I\u2019d be trying to cross a tiny patch of English woodland \u2013 maybe only one mile or so \u2013 and going: \u2018Actually, this is more like how I felt when I was 10.\u2019\u201d Wild Signs and Star Paths is rammed with Gooley\u2019s knowledge. There\u2019s \u201cthe tick\u201d, but there\u2019s also \u201cthe celebration\u201d (the burst of wildflowers on a forest floor that tells you where light falls) and \u201cthe shear\u201d (the tilt of a cloud that indicates wind direction) and \u201cthe invisible handrail\u201d (the use of a prominent landscape feature to help you retain your bearings). In one chapter Gooley suggests he can pinpoint the location of a bonfire, even years after it went out, based on foliage alone. The book makes much of the differentiation between what he calls fast and slow thinking \u2013 basically between instinct and analysis. The more you painstakingly study the sky for navigational pointers, he says, the more the brain will learn to automate the process. It\u2019s the same difference between sounding out a series of letters on a page and seeing a fully formed word. Eventually Tristan and I reach Regent\u2019s Park, and it\u2019s suddenly as if he\u2019s been plugged into the mainframe. In the middle of an entirely unrelated conversation he stops dead in his tracks and slaps me on the arm. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he whispers. I do not hear anything, but say yes anyway. \u201cThat\u2019s the cacophony!\u201d he hisses, pointing to a bush full of birds making what I\u2019d assumed were normal bird noises. \u201cThose were alarm calls, between wrens and tits! There\u2019s something in there the birds aren\u2019t happy with.\u201d Gingerly, we make our way over to investigate, but Tristan stops dead again, even more excited than before. He\u2019s seen a squirrel standing on its hind legs. \u201cLook at it go!\u201d he whispers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a cacophony, the birds aren\u2019t happy and the squirrels have picked up. It\u2019s unlikely they would have gone on hyper-alert because of us.\u201d This has now become a mystery that demands resolution, and fortunately one presents itself. A breeze blows through a row of trees, and Gooley has his answer. \u201cTrees picking up, lot of different cloud types, some shear there,\u201d he notes, running through his process aloud for me. \u201cI think this must be a weather warning. There\u2019s the sixth-sense feel. There was something going on that the birds weren\u2019t happy with, and I could sense it without thinking.\u201d Had we been in the jungle, this intuitiveness could have saved our lives. The birds might have spotted a jaguar, for instance, and their cries would have served as our cue to leave before we became dinner. But we weren\u2019t in the jungle. We were in the middle of Regent\u2019s Park, and the birds were just being vague about inclement weather. \u201cIs this sixth-sense stuff even all that applicable here?\u201d I asked myself. On the way home from the station, I\u2019m caught in an unexpected downpour. Fine, the birds had a point and natural navigation has plenty of real-world uses. Long story short, I now trust Tristan Gooley with my life. How to navigate in a city Look for satellite dishes. They all point towards the equator. In London, that is roughly south-southeast. Find an \u2018invisible handrail\u2019 and use it to remember your bearings. In the countryside, this might be a river. In a city, it could be a main road. Look at a tree. Do the branches point a certain way? That\u2019s probably south. Are the leaves on those branches smaller than the leaves on the opposite side? That\u2019s definitely south. Use the sun. It rises in the east, sets in the west and moves through the southern sky, giving you a very basic compass. Need to get home? Head against the flow of people at the start of the day or with the flow at the end and you are pretty much guaranteed to find a station.
