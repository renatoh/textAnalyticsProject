Outlining the reform to secondary education, following the chancellor's commitment of a 6% increase in the education budget, Ms Morris called for a bold change to the comprehensive system. Addressing the House of Commons', the minister defended her plans for the expansion of specialist schools, criticised by teachers, who accused her of adopting a \"one size fits all\" policy. \"Rather than one size fits all, an acknowledgment of the truth: that each school is different,\" she said. She defended the old comprehensive system saying that its principles, underlined by the notion that \"every child is of equal worth\", remained true today, \"but progress has not been fast enough,\" she said. Her plans focus on the role of headteachers in schools, giving them more flexible grants to, amongst other things, recruit better teachers. But school governors will have to sign up to an \"action plan\" that could include the head's replacement if he or she was judged an obstacle to success. The tough measures will also see the best headteachers being made responsible for clusters of schools in an attempt to \"yank up\" standards across the board. A new national college will help train new school leaders and 1,400 comprehensives out of around 3,500 would get the \u00a3125,000 \"leadership incentive grants\". Ms Morris also announced a \"zero-tolerance\" strategy to tackle pupil behaviour problems, and promised to unveil a new \"behaviour strategy\" in the autumn. The Department for Education and Skills said \"significantly more\" schools would get on-site police officers to deal with truancy, bullying and any other associated crime. And all schools will have the option of an onsite pupil behaviour unit, should they require it. If schools already receiving money from the excellence in cities initiatives are judged to be \"well-led\", up to \u00a3125,000 could be paid \"directly with no strings attached\". Ms Morris also announced plans to develop 1,000 new specialist schools in fields such as sport or the arts. There are already approaching 900 specialist schools and Ms Morris said she wanted at least 2,000 by 2006, as well as at least 33 city academies, the semi-independent state schools that are funded by the state and private sponsorship. Ms Morris proposed several different ways in which schools could band together in \"federations\". A successful school could pair up with one judged to be failing by the education watchdog, Ofsted. Alternatively, schools could join together under a single governing body and chief executive, who could bring in outside help including from the private sector. As promised in last September's white paper, the government would ensure that private firms or charities can be contracted to take over failing schools on fixed-term contracts. Ms Morris concluded that the reform of education was \"a prize well worth waiting for\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
