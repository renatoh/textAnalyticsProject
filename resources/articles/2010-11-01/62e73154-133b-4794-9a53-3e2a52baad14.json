The chilly, dank East Midlands weather was a world away from the Gold Coast. But the Wallabies' Test team, who had their feet up as they prepare to face England, would have warmed to the sight of the second-string beating England's champions 26-15. The game was in the balance until two minutes from time, when the fly-half Berrick Barnes dropped a goal. He scored 16 points in all. Barnes may be behind Quade Cooper in the Test pecking order but he was invaluable to a young squad which included seven uncapped players. The scoreline was rough on Leicester, who 12 months ago beat the South Africans in a match in which Ben Youngs announced his arrival on the big stage. When the Tigers attempted to run the ball in the last move of the game it was intercepted and the flanker Scott Higginbotham ran in unopposed for the second try. Leicester turned back the clock by wearing lettered shirts and there was a rare run-out for the 37-year-old prop Julian White. But if the Tigers thought they were going to spend the evening out-scrummaging the Wallabies they were mistaken. The visitors won an early lineout, the scrum-half Luke Burgess made a sharp break and Lachie Turner broke Thomas Waldrom's tackle to roll over for a try. The first half developed into a kicking duel between Barnes and his opposite number, or rather letter J, Billy Twelvetrees. Twelvetrees reduced Australia's lead to 13-12 with four first-half penalties. In the second half, in the rain, Leicester tried to up the tempo but George Chuter was penalised for punching Van Humphries. Barnes missed the very kickable penalty. A searing break by Twelvetrees then took play inside the Australian 22 and the visitors were penalise for offside. With 15 minutes left, Twelvetrees put the Tigers ahead for the first time. Barnes, though, was on target with a mammoth penalty eight minutes from time that put Australia ahead. The loudest cheer of the night came at half-time. It was for the former Leicester coach Pat Howard, who had flown in from Brisbane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
