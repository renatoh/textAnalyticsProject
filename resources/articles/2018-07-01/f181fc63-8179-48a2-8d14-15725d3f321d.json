His longevity is so unusual that Theresa May has teased him about it. At a journalists\u2019 dinner earlier this year, she joked that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister she would be \u201cbreaking rocks in John McDonnell\u2019s re-education camp \u2026 But, of course, Jeremy Hunt would still be health secretary.\u201d Hunt, the MP for South West Surrey who supported remain during the EU referendum, has long harboured ambitions for a new challenge, despite facing repeated calls for his resignation for overseeing real-term cuts to the NHS. A trusted media performer on television and radio, few Conservatives would be surprised if Hunt\u2019s ambitions at some point turned towards No 10. The eldest son of Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt, he was brought up in Godalming, Surrey, educated at the public school Charterhouse and went to Oxford University. In keeping with many current politicians, he has a first-class degree in philosophy, politics and economics. Hunt, 51, had a successful career as an entrepreneur before entering parliament, setting up the educational publisher, Hotcourses. Last year, the firm was sold for \u00a330.1m, making Hunt a reported profit of over \u00a314m. Politics was his paramount interest. In 2005, he was elected as Conservative MP for the safe Surrey seat. After becoming Tory leader, David Cameron, a contemporary at Oxford, made Hunt the shadow disabilities minister. In a reshuffle in 2007, he was promoted to shadow culture secretary. When the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition entered government in 2010, Hunt joined the cabinet as secretary of state for culture, media and sport \u2013 a key role in the run-up to the London 2012 Olympics. As health secretary, he has survived a series of crises, including criticisms for imposing new contracts on junior doctors, rows over NHS funding levels and accusations that he disappeared from the public sphere during winter bed shortages. He has also survived financial controversies. In April, he was forced to apologise for failing to declare his part-ownership of a company, which bought luxury seaside flats in Southampton. He bought the flats with a bulk discount from a Tory donor. Hunt reduced his tax bill by more than \u00a3100,000 by receiving dividends from Hotcourses in the form of property which was promptly leased back to the company, the Daily Telegraph disclosed in 2012. He is married to Lucia Guo, who is from China, and they have three children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
