The centre in which Australia detained hundreds of refugees between 2001 and 2017 has been razed to the ground. Gone is a landmark of one of the most fracturing episodes in the nation\u2019s recent history. However, the 600 odd men who last called it home \u2013 or prison \u2013 remain. Since November, when Papua New Guinean authorities forcefully evicted them from their old camp, they have been housed in new facilities close to Lorengau town. A covert visit inside the road-blocked entrance reveals structures built to last. The possibility of an imminent end to the men\u2019s almost five-year-long ordeal seems remote. Clockwise from top: Manus island from above, locals on the beach, locals on a small boat, dense green forrest. Those who venture into the streets stand out. A few have made friends. Most, though, spend all their time inside. Partly out of fear of being assaulted \u2013 a frequent problem in a town marked by underemployment and public drunkenness \u2013 but mainly because of depression. A recent UNHCR report describes growing despair, notwithstanding an ongoing resettlement program with the US. Two hundred men have already left for America, and the process has created a buzz among the refugees. But after five years of torment, many have built up defences against hope. Another disappointment could be too much to bear. Clockwise from top: Lorengau, the capital of Manus, an Iranian refuge hugs one of the local children, an Afghan refugee waits for a bus, Behrouz Boochani stands outside the naval base where he and the other refugees were locked in during the first three years, the barracks where refugee facilities are located. Iranian Karam Zahirian \u2013 an architect by trade \u2013 is worried, since the US hasn\u2019t yet selected anyone from Iran. His resilience is growing weak. A few months after he arrived, guards and locals killed his roommate, Reza Barati, in front of his eyes. He was later refused to have a last word with his dying father. Nowadays, he lives by his phone. It\u2019s his only way to communicate with his son, who was born two weeks after he fled. Sometimes, the four-year-old accuses him of lying. \u201cYou always say we will meet soon, but you never come, so how can I trust you,\u201d Zahirian retells the conversation. Every night is a fight against demons. He has already attempted to take his life. \u201cI can\u2019t take much more, I need to get out.\u201d\u2013 Karam Zahirian Clockwise from top: Zahirian, left everything behind when he fled Iran, talking with his son in Iran by smartphone, looking at the ocean, inside the local hospital in Lorengau. Journalist Behrouz Boochani, a compatriot, is of an opposite mind. I leave when the last refugee is out, my mission isn\u2019t done until I\u2019ve documented the end of this story\u201d\u2013 Behrouz Boochani Reporting, filming a documentary and writing a novel (soon to be published by Pan MacMillan), has kept Boochani busy and turned hardship into purpose. Yet, five years in limbo has made him lose track of time. Instead of a regular calendar, he relates to significant events. \u201cTwo months before the hunger-strike,\u201d \u201ca week after navy soldiers shot at the camp,\u201d \u201cthe same day that Hamid Khazaei died.\u201d Above: Boochani lights a hand-rolled cigarette. Below: Boochani on one of the small boats around the island, Behrouz Boochani, (front left ) and Ari Sirwan (foreground), on a trip to a neighbouring island for a swim. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because reading a lot of history, I used to have a very good mind for remembering time. But time in Manus prison is different. Here, it\u2019s the main form of torture. By keeping people in uncertainty you gradually break them down.\u201d About 800 refugees will remain on Manus and Nauru after the US resettlement scheme comes to a close. The offshore detention policy, though, will continue to make waves long after those men, women and children are moved off the islands too. JC Salyer, a lawyer and anthropologist of Barnard College in New York, who has recently done fieldwork around the Manus centre, says growing local disappointment with Australia\u2019s policy has opened the possibility of expanded Chinese influence in the country. Daniel Webb, a Melbourne-based rights lawyer, says the issue will also haunt Australia throughout its ongoing term as a member of the UN Human Rights Council. Above: Shabbir Hossein is from Parachinar, a town in Pakistan wracked for years by sectarian violence, he left a 17-month-old daughter and has been on the island since 2013. A run-down room where refugees were once housed, Lorengau, the capital of Manus. \u201cThe victims of cruelty and injustice all over the world \u2013 families slaughtered in Myanmar, victims of chemical attacks in Syria \u2013 desperately need a strong and effective human rights system, and a government like ours to be a part of the spine of that system. This role has now been impeded by our own deliberate cruelty.\u201d Above and right: Ari Sirwan, 26 is from a town called Sirwan. He worked in Tehran, as a labourer in a market. He used to tell himself \u201din half a year\u2019s time, I\u2019ll get out\u201d, always renewing that pledge every six months. But now, he\u2019s lost the hope of ever getting out. Many Manusians have taken pity on the men stranded on their midst. Fisherman Robin Marakei built a guesthouse on his little islet to give refugees a place to rest. Chris Agua Joe came to know the refugees in jail. He was serving time for possession of drugs, they were there for hunger striking. Soon, he was helping them out in whatever ways he could. In November last year, he became instrumental in smuggling goods to the old camp when refugees refused to leave and authorities cut the supply of food, water and electricity. \u201cIt was risky for me, sometimes the navy caught me with their floodlights. But I\u2019ve got a heart. You just look at them and imagine yourself in their shoes, in a foreign country, having risked their lives,\u201d he says. \u201cYou immediately understand that you definitely need to help.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
