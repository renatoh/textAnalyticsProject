A one-time child prodigy who opened for his admirer BB King when he was just 12, he has developed an interest in blues-related music of every kind, and this second collaboration with the versatile Californian singer Beth Hart is remarkable for its bravery. There are covers of songs made famous by anyone from Billie Holiday to Tina Turner, Buddy Miles or Slackwax. The mood constantly changes, from a brash and brassy Them There Eyes, recorded by Holiday in the Thirties, to an efficiently rocked-up Nutbush City Limits, or fine bluesy vocals and guitar work on I Love You Know More Than You'll Ever Know. Then there's a slinky reworking of an Etta James song, and even a daring, brooding and angry treatment of Strange Fruit. Hart is no Nina Simone, but this is no embarrassment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
