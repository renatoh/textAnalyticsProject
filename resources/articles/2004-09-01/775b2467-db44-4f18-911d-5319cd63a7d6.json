Old Trafford's prodigal son may have failed to conjure a clean sheet but, as the rain abated and the wind dropped, United's \u00a330m centre-half had bowed Liverpool's initially spiky forwards into a similar state of submissive obedience. Admittedly some minutes after Milan Baros replaced Ciss\u00e9, the United physio was slipping a tiring Ferdinand sugar-boosting energy bars. The elements were turning inclement again but his talismanic presence had nevertheless imbued United's vulnerable rearguard with invaluable poise. Finally back after serving an eight-month suspension for failing to turn up for a drugs test a year ago, Ferdinand was the last United player to jog out for the customary warm-up 30 minutes before kick-off. Such a delayed entrance could have been deliberate dramatic timing - or perhaps he was simply staying true to his head-in-the-clouds image and running late. The enduring paradox about him is the contrast between his distinctly laissez-faire, sometimes downright louche, off-field character and the seamless precision of his playing persona. As if to emphasise this, Ferdinand's second significant touch of the ball saw him show off an impressive rapidity of reaction to whisk the ball smoothly away from Ciss\u00e9 and initiate a United counter-attack. No wonder team-mates claim \"Rio is so cool it hurts\". If months of deprivation from the adrenalin of competition during intensely repetitive pre-Athens training left Paula Radcliffe short of prime condition for the Olympic marathon, someone dropping in from another planet would never have guessed Ferdinand had not played since January. Indeed, watching him regularly second guess Garcia and Ciss\u00e9, siphoning the Spaniard and Frenchman into benign positions, one wondered just how someone with such acute antennae for attacking danger could be stupid enough to sentence himself to eight months on the sidelines. Although one early challenge on Garcia was sufficiently mis-timed to have arguably merited a yellow card, it was easy to understand why Sir Alex Ferguson had resisted the temptation to offer Ferdinand at least one reserve game by way of re-acclimatisation after his ban expired at midnight on Sunday. \"I had not the slightest hesitation about throwing him in at the deep end,\" said United's manager in his programme notes. \"If you could have watched Rio's focus in training you would know, like me, that the man is geared to come straight back into the side, even for a match this big.\" It is, of course, a shame that Ferdinand's \"focus\" turned so inexplicably blurry when the drug testers came calling to United's Carrington training ground last September. After responding to the initial demand for a post-training sample with a \"Yeah, no problem\" he allegedly forgot and went shopping instead. Rarely can a slice of retail therapy have proved so costly - even if Ferdinand's eight-month angst was cushioned by his continuing to receive a weekly \u00a370,000 pay packet - but, rather than question how a culture which treated drug testers with such disdain had developed at his club, Ferguson opted to go into quasi-denial. In other words, he pretended that the suspension \"was really a serious injury - and treated it like that.\" Moreover, United's manager did not lack precedent for this sort of thing. Eric Cantona was banned for a similar period after aiming a kung-fu kick at a Crystal Palace fan in 1955. As Ferguson reminded us: \"Ironically it was against Liverpool that Eric made his return. And, as his performance that day emphasised, it wasn't a risk with Eric either. He and Rio have a similar one-eyed approach to the game.\" Cristiano Ronaldo and even Mikael Silvestre probably eclipsed Ferdinand here but his supply of Ronaldo with a string of inviting passes was indicative of a player boasting 20-20 football vision. If Arsenal are to be overhauled, United will require similarly assured judgment on a regular basis from now on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
