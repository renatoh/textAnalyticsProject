On Portsmouth's current sinking form \u2013 three points off the relegation zone in the league and held to a replay in the previous round against Bristol City \u2013 not many would have blinked at yet another hiccup to mar their deteriorating season. Roberto Martinez's Swansea were well placed to dole one out. Seventeen league places separate the teams, but that statistic was barely apparent here. Martinez's team arrived in sparkling form and are now unbeaten in 12 matches. Playing a neat passing game and pressing on the counter-attack, they played their more illustrious opponents off the pitch. And still, incredibly, Martinez insisted his side could do better. \"I didn't think it was 10 out of 10,\" he said. \"There was room for improvement, from our point of view.\" He did praise the team's composure, though, and well he might. Unruffled against the Cup holders at a Premier League ground, the majority of his players are still adjusting to the Championship. \"I'm proud of every single one of them. Slowly, we're growing as a squad and that's very pleasing. We got a taste of the Premier League and we showed we could handle it,\" he said, indicating his future ambitions. In the gloom of defeat, Liverpool loanee Jermaine Pennant, making his Portsmouth debut, must have wondered how he missed an opportunity to sign for Real Madrid. His newly adopted side made a bright enough start, Pennant's partnership with Peter Crouch doing exactly what it said on the tin \u2013 the right-winger skipping past defenders and whipping in crosses for the big man \u2013 but Portsmouth collapsed once the visitors went ahead. To add insult to injury, it was a Southampton player who scored. Nathan Dyer, on loan to Swansea this season and booed every time his tiny red boots touched the ball, caused mayhem, slipping past Sylvain Distin to convert Jason Scotland's pass. It had taken Swansea 26 minutes to snatch the lead, which should have been too early for the rot to set in for the home team. But Portsmouth flailed in the face of ignominy and despite numerous chances to pull one back, the ball simply refused to run for them. A controversial penalty ended the first half, Nadir Belhadj adjudged to have brought down Jordi Gomez in the area when he was just outside it. Belhadj protested, but Swansea's leading scorer Scotland happily stepped up to add to his tally and send the visitors two goals ahead. A furious David James blasted the ball into the crowd as the two teams filtered in. In the second half, Portsmouth created enough chances to get back into the game, but their movements failed to connect as they wished and Swansea stood firm. By the final whistle, Swansea could have been further in front, although they hardly needed the extra goals to underline their dominance. Afterwards, a frustrated Adams lamented his prescience: \"I did warn them, I told them before the game 'You're playing against a very good Swansea team' and sadly I was proved right. \"I don't think we deserved to go 2-0 down, but certainly we didn't play well. There were signs there, but we left ourselves too much to do. I don't think it was the system [we played]. I think we were just outplayed, outfought and outclassed. \"They [Portsmouth] got caught by surprise, I think. We showed them on video what a great team they are and they've obviously got caught today. I think the only thing you do now is you put it to bed and try and get three points on Tuesday night against Aston Villa.\" Meanwhile, Martinez and his merry bunch of supporters returned home to Swansea in heroic mood. Seven years younger than Adams, and in just his second season of management, the classy Spaniard has high hopes for his Championship side.
