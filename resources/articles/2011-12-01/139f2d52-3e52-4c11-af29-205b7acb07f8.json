We \u2026 reserve our right to appeal or take any other course of action we feel appropriate with regards to this situation. We find it extraordinary that Luis can be found guilty on the word of Patrice Evra alone when no one else on the field of play heard the alleged conversation between the two players in a crowded Kop goalmouth while a corner-kick was about to be taken. The club takes extremely seriously the fight against all forms of discrimination and has a long and successful track record in work relating to anti-racist activity and social inclusion. We remain committed to this ideal and equality for all, irrespective of a person's background. LFC considers racism in any form to be unacceptable \u2013 without compromise. It is our strong-held belief, having gone over the facts of the case, that Luis Su\u00e1rez did not commit any racist act. It is also our opinion that the accusation by this particular player was not credible \u2013 certainly no more credible than his prior unfounded accusations. It is key to note that Patrice Evra himself in his written statement in this case said: 'I don't think that Luis Su\u00e1rez is racist.' The FA in their opening remarks accepted that Luis Su\u00e1rez was not racist. Luis himself is of a mixed race family background as his grandfather was black. He has played with black players and mixed with their families whilst with the Uruguay national side and was captain at Ajax Amsterdam of a team with a proud multicultural profile, many of whom became good friends. It seems incredible to us that a player of mixed heritage should be accused and found guilty in the way he has based on the evidence presented. We do not recognise the way in which Luis Su\u00e1rez has been characterised. Nothing we have heard in the hearing has changed our view that Luis Su\u00e1rez is innocent and we will provide Luis with whatever support he now needs to clear his name. We would also like to know when the FA intend to charge Patrice Evra with making abusive remarks to an opponent after he admitted in his evidence to insulting Luis Su\u00e1rez in Spanish in the most objectionable of terms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
