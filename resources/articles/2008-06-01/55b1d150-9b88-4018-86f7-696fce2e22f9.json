Psychologists have been pretty sure about that since 1923, when George M Stratton of the University of California published a study called The Colour Red, and the Anger of Cattle. \"It is probable,\" Stratton opined, \"that this popular belief arises from the fact that cattle, and particularly bulls, have attacked persons displaying red, when the cause of the attack lay in the behaviour of the person, in his strangeness, or in other factors apart from the colour itself. The human knowledge that red is the colour of blood, and that blood is, or seemingly should be, exciting, doubtless has added its own support to this fallacy.\" Stratton, aided by a Miss Morrison and a Mr Blodgett, conducted an experiment on several small herds of cattle - 40 head altogether, a mixture of bulls and bullocks (bullocks are castrated bulls), and cows and calves, including some that were accustomed to wandering the range and others that lived in barns. The researchers obtained white, black, red and green strips of cloth, each measuring two by six feet. These they attached \"endwise to a line stretched high enough to let the animals go easily under it; from this line the colours hung their six feet of length free of the ground, well-separated, and ready to flutter in the breeze.\" The cattle showed indifference to the banners, except sometimes when a breeze made the cloth flutter. Males and females reacted the same way, as did \"tame\" and \"wild\" animals. Red did nothing for them. Farmers seem to have already suspected this. Stratton surveyed some. He reports that \"of 66 such persons who have favoured me with their careful replies, I find that 38 believe that red never excites cattle to anger; 15 believe that red usually does not excite them to anger, although exceptionally it may; eight believe that it usually so excites, though exceptionally it may not; and three believe that it always so excites.\" One of those three dissenters described her views, well, colourfully: \"A lively little Jersey cow, whom I had known all her six years of life, chased me through a barbed-wire fence when I was wearing a red dress and sweater, and never did so before or after. I changed to a dull grey, and re-entered the corral, and she paid no attention to me, and let me feed and water her as usual. Also, a Durham bull whom I had raised from a calf, and was a perfect family pet, chased me till I fell from sight through some brush when I was wearing the same outfit of crimson.\" More typical, though, was the farmer who told Stratton: \"In referring to the saying, 'Like waving a red rag before a bull', I have found that to wave anything before a bull is a dangerous business.\" \u00b7 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
