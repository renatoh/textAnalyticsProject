Tightly staged tableaux plot key scenes in the writer's career, highlighting his uneasy relationship with fame and his even more uneasy relationship with his sexuality. Tucked inside the narrative, like its dream shadow, are three Andersen tales - The Shadow, The Little Mermaid and The Snow Queen. Again, if you know the life story it's apparent how cleverly Brandstrup has selected these tales. The mermaid's hopeless pursuit of her prince echoes Andersen's frustrated homosexual desires; in The Snow Queen, Andersen is present both in Gerda's dogged loyalty and Kay's blinded fascination with the Snow Queen's icy glamour. Brandstrup is a gifted story teller in his own right and he sketches the tales with rapid wit - forging the relationship between the writer and his shadow with a sinisterly mirrored duet; having the witch spike the mermaid's new feet with brutal explicitness. Andersen, as their writer, is also vividly present, his comic, garrulous gestures conjuring characters out of thin air. Framing the choreography, and taking the narrative forward are the hallucinatory video images created by design team the Brothers Quay, which project shadow puppets, sea depths and snow plains on to the action. Ian Dearden's musical arrangement creates a sensitive atmosphere and the nine dancers could hardly be bettered. But for those who come to Andersen with only dim childhood memories, this work will be problematic. A huge amount is crammed into 75 minutes, and because Brandstrup fastidiously avoids a crude underlining of his themes and narrative, it's easy to lose the thread. This is a work that cries out for a bigger staging - a larger cast, obvious sets, brighter colours. It needs to be more blockbuster, less vignette. \u00b7 Until November 6.
