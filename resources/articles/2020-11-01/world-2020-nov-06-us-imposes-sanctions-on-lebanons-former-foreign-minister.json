The move against Gibran Bassil for alleged corruption was announced on Friday as Trump\u2019s chances of re-election continued to dip, and marks a sharp escalation of efforts to limit Hezbollah\u2019s influence in Lebanese affairs. Crucially, it is a direct challenge to the country\u2019s president and Bassil\u2019s father in law, Michel Aoun, who Washington has considered an ally. The decision is likely to derail attempts to form a new government aimed at stymieing an economic and social freefall in a country where fear and poverty is rising daily. It is also a pointed threat to other members of a political class that their personal interests are at stake if they stall on demands made of them in the dying months of the Trump presidency. The allegations of corruption levelled at Bassil could have been made against officials at all levels of government. The former foreign minister, however, was central to a power-sharing pact in 2016 that cemented Hezbollah\u2019s muscular role in Lebanese life and led to Gulf states, which had long acted as benefactors, turning their backs on the ailing nation. Ever since, Bassil had become a deeply divisive figure disliked in equal measure for his alleged role in siphoning state funds away from energy reforms and for giving cover to what has broadly been seen in Washington and the Gulf states as a Hezbollah takeover of Lebanon. Saudi Arabia and the UAE in particular had blamed current prime minister designate, Saad Hariri, for striking a deal with Bassil and Aoun, which consolidated the regional role of Hezbollah\u2019s backer, Iran. In recent months, Washington\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran has switched focus to Hezbollah, which remains the most important arm of Tehran\u2019s foreign policy. Senior Trump officials have acknowledged that they would attempt to use their remaining time in office to move harder against Iranian regional influence than any earlier administration. In a statement, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said: \u201cThroughout his government career, Bassil has become notorious for corruption and has been linked to the purchase of influence within Lebanese political circles. \u201cWhile minister of energy, Bassil was involved in approving several projects that would have steered Lebanese government funds to individuals close to him through a group of front companies. \u201cThrough his corrupt activities, Bassil has also undermined good governance and contributed to the prevailing system of corruption and political patronage that plagues Lebanon, which has aided and abetted Hezbollah\u2019s destabilizing activities.\u201d Faysal Itani, deputy director at the Centre for Global Policy, said: \u201cBassil is definitely not the only prominent non-Shia politician to give cover to Hezbollah. But as far as sanctions are concerned he is a proverbial low-hanging fruit. Going after his father in law would be seen locally as an attack on the Christians as a whole, and on a sitting president. This is a potent US signal of the cost of being too friendly with Hezbollah. As a bonus, this is a nice boost to Hariri politically as he tries to put a cabinet together, which Bassil\u2019s party has boycotted.\u201d Bassil responded to the move on Twitter, saying \u201csanctions didn\u2019t scare me and promises didn\u2019t tempt me\u201d. \u201cI will not turn against any Lebanese national \u2026 and I\u2019m not saving myself to destroy Lebanon,\u201d he added. \u201cI have grown accustomed to injustice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
