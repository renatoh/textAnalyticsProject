He will be without the six players in Sven-Goran Eriksson's senior selection who would otherwise have played in Switzerland, and Manchester City's Shaun Wright-Phillips and the Liverpool pair Stephen Wright and Chris Kirkland are injured, buthe is so confident of his young squad's potential that he is still aiming for victory. \"I don't feel any pressure but I'm quite happy to burden myself and say we'll win it,\" Platt said. \"I think this is the best squad ever to play for England's Under-21s and we can go on and win the tournament. Getting to the semi-final is irrelevant. Getting to the final is irrelevant. You've got to win it, and I'm happy to put my head on the line and say we will. \"I think the number of young players in the senior squad is testament to the quality of young players that are around. I don't think any other England manager in recent times has had that kind of quality at that age to choose from. It's the best crop of youngsters we've ever had.\" Ledley King, Michael Carrick and David Dunn, who have all been mentioned as possible recruits for Eriksson's team, join Platt instead, though injuries to senior players could lead to them or others making emergency journeys to Japan. \"I'd sooner be in this position than have Sven say he's going to name a standby squad that has six of my players in it, who end up staying at home because there's no injuries. If I do get the call, my reaction would be to be absolutely delighted to put that player on the plane.\" Dunn in particular may be disappointed not to have already secured a place in the World Cup squad, given the clamour for his inclusion earlier this year, but Platt revealed that the Blackburn midfielder, who will captain his side, was never seriously considered. \"It was never there for him,\" he said. \"People were talking about him, and the media have blown it out of all proportion, but they were talking about it more than David ever was. He definitely caught Sven's eye but his form dipped just when Sven was looking at players.\" Platt's squad is tremendously experienced, with only two players - David Prutton and Bobby Zamora - who finished the season outside the Premiership. \"I can look at the squad and know that no matter what team I put out we will be strong,\" he said. England's task, however, is a difficult one. In the first round they play Switzerland, who having not qualified for the World Cup will include several full internationals, Portugal, the only team to have beaten Platt's Under-21s, and Italy, champions four times in the past 10 years. Their campaign begins against the hosts next Friday. Squad: Robinson (Leeds), Taylor (Arsenal), Bywater (West Ham); Young (Charlton), Barry (Aston Villa), Riggott (Derby), King (Tottenham), Knight (Fulham), Konchesky (Charlton); Pennant (Arsenal), Davis (Fulham), Jenas (Newcastle), Prutton (Nottm Forest), Carrick (West Ham), Parker (Charlton), Dunn (Blackburn); Defoe (West Ham), Smith (Leeds), Ameobi (Newcastle), Christie (Derby), Crouch (Aston Villa), Zamora (Brighton). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
