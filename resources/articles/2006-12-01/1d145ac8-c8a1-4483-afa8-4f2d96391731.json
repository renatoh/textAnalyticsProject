One dish I like to do at this time of year is prosecco risotto with scallops. Firstly because Irish scallops are so plentiful right now, but also because prosecco, the fizzy white wine of north-eastern Italy, is a lovely, light drink that is perfect for a celebration; we drink it instead of champagne. Prosecco - which is the name of the vine - was virtually unheard of in the UK until fairly recently, but is now easy to get hold of. The combination of smooth, velvety scallops, fruity, tangy prosecco and starchy rice is wonderful. To serve six, you need: 10 medium-large scallops with corals; 50g butter; one onion, finely chopped; 400g superfino carnaroli rice, a bottle of prosecco (you don't need that much for the dish, but this means you can have a glass while you're cooking); two and a half litres of hot fish stock; the juice of half a lemon; salt and pepper. Cut 12 thin (about 2mm thick) slices of scallop for garnish, then dice the rest of the meat, including the corals. Melt the butter in a large, heavy-based pot, add the onion and fry gently until translucent. Add the rice and stir to coat. Add 120ml of prosecco, let the alcohol evaporate , then add a little stock, stirring all the while - you don't want to let the rice get too wet. When the liquid has been absorbed, add another ladle of stock, and stir. Repeat for 15-17min, until the rice is soft, but al dente. Turn down the heat and stir in the diced scallops, lemon juice and seasoning. Spoon into bowls and, just before serving, season the reserved scallop slices and place two on top of each dish - the heat of the rice will cook them straight away. \u00b7 Giorgio Locatelli is chef-patron of Locanda Locatelli, London W1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
