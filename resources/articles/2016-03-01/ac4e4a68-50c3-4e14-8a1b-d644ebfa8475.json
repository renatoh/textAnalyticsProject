The London School of Economics report is a damning indictment of the state of executive pay, and comes as an analysis of FTSE 100 company accounts shows that the average pay package of a top CEO is now \u00a34.6m a year. Interviews with the top 10 international recruitment firms behind 70-90% of chief executive appointments in recent years found a consensus among so-called corporate kingmakers that levels of remuneration for the most senior executives are \u201cabsurdly high\u201d. Headhunters claimed that, for every appointment of a CEO, another 100 people could have filled the role just as ably, and that many chosen for top jobs were \u201cmediocre\u201d. The market for executive jobs, however, has become so distorted that it would amount to career suicide for a chief executive to indicate that he or she would be willing to work for less. The study\u2019s authors write: \u201cIf one were to offer to do the job for less, would that tip the decision in his or her favour? All the headhunters agreed that this would be a poor strategy. \u201cIndeed, it might be that asking for a larger remuneration would have a positive effect in securing the appointment.\u201d They go on: \u201cThere was almost universal agreement among the search firms that levels of remuneration for CEOs in large UK non-financial firms was absurdly high. All the interviews supported the notion of an arbitrary norm for pay, which almost all firms felt was grossly and inappropriately high \u2026 The general view of search firms is that a lower norm would not materially affect what happens.\u201d One headhunter said: \u201cI think there are an awful lot of FTSE 100 CEOs who are pretty mediocre.\u201d Another added: \u201cI think that the wage drift over the past 10 years, or the salary drift, has been inexcusable, incomprehensible, and it is very serious for the social fabric of the country.\u201d The findings are being made public just as an analysis by the High Pay Centre thinktank shows that the average pay of a chief executive \u2013 including pensions, share options and bonuses \u2013 stands at about \u00a34.6m. The thinktank analysed the figures of the 32 FTSE 100 firms to have filed accounts for 2015. Amid concerns that executive pay in Britain is now hundreds of times that of the average employee of a firm, extreme examples of remuneration emerged. Morrisons\u2019 CEO Dalton Philips nearly doubled his remuneration to \u00a32.1m in the year before he was sacked, while Tesco boss Dave Lewis received \u00a34.1m \u2013 nearly three times the amount paid to his predecessor. The figures reported in company accounts \u2013 as required under guidelines established in 2013 to make pay comparisons easier \u2013 could even understate the level of pay given the unpredictability of bonuses. Max Steuer, reader emeritus at the LSE and author of the new research paper, Headhunter Methods for CEO Selection, published in the Journal of General Management, said there was little evidence that lower pay would see a \u201cbrain drain\u201d, as has been suggested. \u201cIn Denmark and other continental countries, the CEOs don\u2019t get this high pay but they don\u2019t seem to leave. The idea that if their pay were lower, British executives could show up in New York and say we would like to have your jobs, is a little implausible. I think the best way of thinking about it is that performance plays very little role in the selection process. Contrary to people saying these chief executives are \u2018unusually able\u2019, we don\u2019t find any evidence of that. \u201cI am a great defender of capitalism and the market and what worries me about all this is that it threatens to erode the market.\u201d Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said there was a systemic problem in executive pay, which may be resolved through greater involvement of employee representatives in the remuneration process. \u201cThere is much less of a \u2018global market\u2019 than people claim. The problem here is really systemic. It\u2019s not just the headhunters\u2019 fault. Institutional investors, company remuneration committees, pay consultancies and CEOs themselves could all show greater restraint. \u201cHaving employee representatives involved in this process could help. Some top bosses, it seems, are keen to manage all their costs \u2013 except the cost of employing them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
