The culture of targets started early in the government, but reached its zenith in the past few weeks as government websites published a series of technical agreements setting out its detailed plans. In the summer, the number of targets was reduced from 600 to around 200, partly under advice from the left of centre thinktank, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). The argument advanced by the IPPR's Matthew Taylor was that if there are 600 targets, there are no real priorities and therefore no real lead for departments to concentrate on. In November, the government supplemented the targets with a group of service delivery agreements setting out how these targets were to be implemented. Since then, further real meat has been added by way of a series of \"departmental technical notes\" setting out the baseline from which these percentage improvements are to be achieved, as well as how they are to be measured. For instance, the Home Office has had to define precisely what it means by vehicle crime or robbery. In some cases these targets are easier to put in numerical form, for instance, by cutting the level of vehicle crime by a fixed date. The statisticial base is already there. In other areas, the government has been driving blind. It has no means of measuring accurately how successful it has been at cutting access to drugs. Indeed it has no real statistical basis for any of its four key anti-drug targets. Other issues simply do not lend themselves to statistical analysis. An attempt to measure the Foreign Office's influence in the world is reduced to establishing the increase in imprints on the Foreign Office or BBC world service website. Similarly, the Ministry of Defence, in the absence of commiting itself to win the next inherently unpredictable war, has had to develop a series of measurements on military preparedness and efficiency. However, in the key domestic fields such as education, crime and health, many of the targets are measurable. Whitehall has learnt from its mistakes by focusing on outcomes, rather than inputs. The Department for Education has dropped targets based on class sizes - an input measurement - and instead focused on exam and test results. Even so, some of the key education targets have yet to be set. Nevertheless, most of those that have been set should be achieved, but if they are not, the Conservative leader at the time of a 2004-5 election will have a ready target. Similar to education, health has a range of carefully prepared targets. But it is notable that the Department of Health no longer has a target based on cutting waiting lists, one of the five targets set in the 1997 general election. Instead, measures are based on reducing deaths or waiting times. Inevitably, the scope and depth of the agreements negotiated between government departments and the Treasury will be seen as confirmation of the extent to which the Chancellor Gordon Brown is in overall command of domestic Labour policy. But Blairites and Brownites are convinced of the efficacy of targets. The thinking is largely derived from President Clinton's bid to reinvent US federal government, but also stems from US private sector management techniques. It has also forced central government to recognise its weaknesses. The very attempt to define targets precisely has exposed the extent to which government has a poor or inconsistent statistical base. For a fiercely non-ideological government interested in evidence-based policy, or \"what works\", the lack of a research and statistical base in key areas has startled policy makers. It is also becoming clear that Mr Blair will have to sanction an explosion of surveys and market research, if Whitehall is to know whether it is meeting its objective performance measurements. But the targets have a wider purpose in trying to shake up the culture of Whitehall. Geoff Mulgan, a formal special adviser at Number 10 and now director of the performance and innovation unit, based in the Cabinet Office, is probably the leading Blairite thinker on government and public services. Giving evidence to the public administration committee on Wednesday, Mr Mulgan was frank about the weaknesses at the centre of government. He admitted Whitehall, especially the centre, lacked the capacity to innovate, think robustly and was too prone to short-term thinking. More importantly, he argued targets would help civil servants and ministers shift their focus of thinking from policy to implementation. He told MPs: \"Practical implementation has been undervalued in British government and society in the past, relative to the formal task of writing elegant minutes and memorandums and legislation. There have been too many fields, policy failures and failures of delivery and implementation\". There needed to be a new culture right across Whitehall based on implementation spurred by measurable targets. Financial rewards and promotion needed to go to civil servants with frontline experience. \"Direct practitioners needed to be brought into the policy role early on so that one does not see a separation between policy specialist and implementer. The implementer would then be able to give a reality check on whether something was deliverable\". The specific targets, so far as possible, should be monitored through the Cabinet spending committee. Their very existence would help civil servants and ministers focus on implementation and stop thinking in terms of the short term. He added that many polices are not implemented right first time, but instead adjustments needed to be made quickly based on hard-edged evidence. It is these reforms - increasing the capacity of Whitehall to innovate and learn from what works - that delivery will improve. He said he was \"suspicious of grand blueprints and structural redesigns. One reason British government has gone wrong in the past is in believing that if you create a new architecture you somehow automatically solve the underlying problems\". Mr Mulgan's vision of a new flexible delivery driven Whitehall may be right. But if in four years time, a second-term Labour government has missed a string of its targets, ministers are unlikely to thank the people who invented this rod for their back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
