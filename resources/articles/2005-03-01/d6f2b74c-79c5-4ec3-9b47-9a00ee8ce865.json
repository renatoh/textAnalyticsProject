I couldn't lean any further and that cost me time everywhere. \"My [Rizla Suzuki] technicians have been beyond brilliant this weekend. They have accommodated my injury and gave me a fantastic GSX-R1000 to race. They even gave me reinforced toe-sliders so I could complete 30 laps without wearing through my entire right boot.\" The Japanese rider Ryuichi Kiyonari dominated the round. The 22-year-old, on a \u00a3250,000 Fireblade for the factory H M Plant Honda team, swept through both 30-lap races without serious opposition. He also won the final two races of the 2004 season at Donington. Honda are using the British series to develop Kiyonari for either the World superbike series or MotoGP competition. He rewarded their faith by leading the first race from start to finish and breaking John Reynolds' lap record. \"I felt that I had to get good starts because I knew how fast the other riders are at Brands Hatch,\" Kiyonari said. He has already moved 14 points clear in the 13-round championship and will go into the next race at Thruxton on April 10 full of confidence. Spain's Gregorio Lavilla holds second place in the series, after a second and a third on his Airwaves Ducati. In the first race Lavilla, who was drafted into the team as a last-minute replacement for the injured James Haydon, battled to second place ahead of Australia's Glen Richards on his Hawk Kawasaki to make it the first all-foreign podium in the history of the British superbike series. That was quickly repeated in the second race, with the 21-year-old British hopeful Leon Haslam just missing out on a podium finish. Michael Rutter, Kiyonari's team-mate and a title favourite before the weekend, could only finish fourth in the first race but after improving on his front tyre selection finished as runner-up in the second. He is now third overall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
