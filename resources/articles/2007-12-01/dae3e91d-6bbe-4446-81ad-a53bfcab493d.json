Cooper, who was portrayed by James Nesbitt in the television drama Bloody Sunday, said he was 'strongly in favour' of the SDLP 'getting into bed with Fianna Fail'. The former Community Relations Minister in the 1974 power-sharing executive will address a Fianna Fail meeting at the Goat Bar in south Dublin, where he will tell party members that he supports their move into Northern Ireland and eventual fusion with the SDLP. A former member of the Young Unionists, Cooper said he backed Fianna Fail's foray into northern politics because the ruling party had policies of an all-Ireland dimension. 'First of all, I will tell them about the SDLP's contribution to peace in Northern Ireland. I will remind them that the SDLP was part of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement; it was born out of it. 'But I will also say that it's now time to take a fresh look at things from the SDLP's viewpoint. I favour an alliance because Fianna Fail is coming north and it would be wrong to see them competing for votes with the SDLP. They should have a strong relationship and work together as a political force. It's also attractive because it means this alliance is part of an all-Ireland organised party,' Cooper told The Observer yesterday. His intervention is timely because Fianna Fail announced at the weekend that it has become a registered political party in Northern Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
