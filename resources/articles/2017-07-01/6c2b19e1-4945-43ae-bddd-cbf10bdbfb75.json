Peacock, who was just 19 when he became one of the faces of the 2012 Paralympic and Olympic summer by winning gold in the blue riband event, had to work hard to hold off the challenge of the USA\u2019s Jarryd Wallace and South Africa\u2019s Johannes Floors but there was still fresh air between the winner and his rivals as he crossed the line. The 24-year-old could be seen mouthing \u201cWow\u201d as the roar went up around the stadium when his name was announced in the heats \u2013 \u201cIt was absolutely phenomenal,\u201d said Peacock of the atmosphere \u2013 but as he stormed over the line in a personal best 10.64sec, smiling for the cameras to the right of the track from 30 metres out, it was those in the stands who were left open-mouthed in admiration. The time was just three-hundredths of a second outside the world record. A challenge to Richard Browne\u2019s mark of 10.61sec seemed on the cards in the final, and though that did not materialise Peacock, who had his right leg amputated below the knee after contracting meningitis at the age of five, still did more than enough to take his second world championship gold. \u201cI was feeling some serious cramp in the warm up, my hamstring gripped so much, that was why I was stretching\u201a\u201d said Peacock, who recovered from a sluggish start to come home in 10.75sec. \u201cI was just thankful that I finished the race. When it comes to the final it\u2019s not about the times. \u201cI definitely could have gone faster. I am always going to look back and think I could have done it, if I had held up better I could have done it. But at the end of the day, I came here for the world title and I\u2019m thankful that I finished the race in one piece.\u201d Peacock\u2019s gold was Great Britain\u2019s eighth in the first three days of the championship, a tally that sees the team top of the medals table ahead of the USA. In the morning session, Aled Davies had added No7, successfully completing the first half of what he hopes will be a third successive world championship double with gold in the men\u2019s F42 discus. The 26-year-old Welshman, who won discus and shot put gold at the world championships in 2013 and 2015, will hope to complete the set in the shot next Saturday. While Davies\u2019 consistency over the years is hugely impressive, he has a fair way to go to match that of Dan Greaves. The 34-year-old F44 discus thrower won his first Paralympic medal, a silver, as a 17-year-old in Sydney in 2000 and went on to equal Tanni Grey-Thompson\u2019s achievement of winning medals in five successive Paralympics. Greaves immediately set his sights on these championships after a bronze in Rio, his last Games, but the Great Britain co-captain fell agonisingly short of adding to his four world championship medals, with Croatia\u2019s Ivan Katanusic edging him out of the medals by just 32cm. \u201cI\u2019m feeling very heartbroken; it wasn\u2019t the performance I know I am capable of,\u201d said Greaves, who also was also fourth in the world championships in Doha two years ago. \u201cI have got to go away and think about this performance because you can\u2019t get emotionally wrapped up in it. I don\u2019t want to bow out on that performance and this feeling.\u201d Earlier in the evening the Scottish sprinter Maria Lyle added a bronze to the one she won in Rio in the women\u2019s T35 200m. At 17, Lyle is something of a veteran in the event \u2013 the Australian gold medal winner, Isis Holt, has just turned 16, while only one athlete in the seven-woman field was older than 19."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
