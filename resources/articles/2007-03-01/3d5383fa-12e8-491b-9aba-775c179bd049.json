To mark the launch of his band Big Satan's new Live In Cognito album, Berne, bassist Drew Gress and drummer Tom Rainey tour the UK; the three-night run at London's Vortex includes an appearance by guitarist Marc Ducret on Monday and Tuesday, with the latter show a double-header for two powerful Berne bands - Paraphrase in the first half, Big Satan in the second. Artists Steve Byram and Jonathan Rosen also furnish works to accompany the music. \u00b7 CBSO Centre, Birmingham, Sat 24; Vortex, N16, Sun 25 to Tue 27; The Wardrobe, Leeds, Wed 28; Jazz Centre @ The Lot, Edinburgh, Thu 29; Lighthouse, Poole, Fri 30"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
