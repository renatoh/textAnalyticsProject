After the furore that accompanied the handling of Wayne Rooney's broken metatarsal before the World Cup, the Old Trafford club appear to have entered the Steve McClaren era with an air of compliance and are happy to allow Ferdinand to join the squad tomorrow. It is possible that Ferdinand may not feature against Andorra at Old Trafford on Saturday, particularly as the more arduous encounter with Macedonia in Skopje follows four days later. The England coach, moreover, yesterday emphasised the difficulty Joe Cole may have in forcing his way back into the starting line-up due to the form of Stewart Downing. McClaren, who gave Downing his debut at Middlesbrough, yesterday praised the player's ability to hold his position on the left in the friendly win over Greece, something the right-footed Cole is not entirely comfortable with. \"Stewart is a left-sider and like any wide player he holds the position, plays it well and gives other players room,\" McClaren said. \"There was a certain degree of maturity about his performances at the World Cup and that became even more evident against Greece, when he gave us really good balance.\" McClaren cited Frank Lampard's first-half goal against the European Champions as proof of how important Downing's contribution can be. \"By staying out wide you create a channel for other players to run into,\" he said. \"It's like a lane; if it's blocked up and people are in it, you do not make the run. Frank spotted the lane was free - as he did on a few other occasions - and that was why he scored his goal.\" Owen Hargreaves is due in Manchester today but much to Sir Alex Ferguson's frustration the Bayern Munich midfielder will only be linking up with the England squad rather than heading for Old Trafford for talks over a potential transfer. United retain hopes of persuading Bayern to part with the 25-year-old before Thursday's transfer deadline, although the Bundesliga club insisted last night that they envisage Hargreaves playing alongside, rather than replacing, the Holland midfielder Mark van Bommel following his \u00a34m arrival from Barcelona on a three-year contract. Hargreaves's representatives are understood to be growing concerned that the deal may not materialise before the closure of the transfer window, with the player having made it clear he would favour a move to the Premiership. \"We want to move forward with Mark and Owen together,\" said the Bayern general manager Uli Hoeness, who sees Van Bommel as a straight replacement for the departed Michael Ballack. \"Our transfer activity for the summer is finally over now. We are not a bank but a football team and we would be crazy to sign Van Bommel as a replacement for Hargreaves.\" Juventus last night claimed that they have no intention of offloading their France striker David Trezeguet, 28, another player who has attracted interest from United, despite reports in Italy suggesting the forward's father, Jorge, had travelled to Manchester in the hope of brokering a deal. Trezeguet, reportedly priced at around \u00a317m by the Italian side, has watched a host of players depart this summer following Juve's relegation to Serie B. \"I don't know what the player has in mind but we won't give up on Trezeguet,\" said the Juventus president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli, although Lyon are also preparing to bid for the striker. \"He will remain at Juve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
