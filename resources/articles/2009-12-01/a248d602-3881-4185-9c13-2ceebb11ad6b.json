That, to Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, seemed an agonisingly long period to watch his expensively recruited team under-perform. To many football people, viewing those results in the context of a season, or City's cocked up modern history, it looks like a billionaire's impatience to sack a manager, with a team having lost only two matches, sitting sixth in the Premier League. Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chairman Mansour appointed, was expressing glowing confidence in Hughes three months ago, after City began the season with serial victories. The Abu Dhabi regime was proud to have resisted all the press talk of dispensing with Hughes when they arrived, in favour of a more stellar name. \"We believe in loyalty,\" he said then, of sticking with Hughes throughout last season. \"We don't leave our men behind, we stick with them. It was very unfair what Mark had to face but we wanted him to succeed. Believe me, I really feel Mark is going to be a great manager.\" Khaldoon, 33, the US-educated chief executive of the huge Mubadala investment fund and chairman of the Executive Affairs Authority which provides strategic advice to the Abu Dhabi government, generally impresses people, Hughes included, as thoughtful and genuine. Something serious clearly happened to his faith in Hughes after those late summer sentiments, during City's draws of autumn. In the two statements, one issued by Khaldoon, for the club, after Saturday's 4-3 victory over Sunderland, the other by the League Managers Association yesterday on behalf of Hughes, there were different opinions over whether Hughes was in fact hitting the \"targets\" agreed for the season at City. After \u00a3200m Hughes was authorised to spend on players, and the complete overhaul of City's infrastructure, the aim was for 70 points. With 29 points gained from 17 matches averaged out, City are heading for 65, some justification for Hughes's statement that: \"We were absolutely on target at the time of my dismissal.\" Yet the crucial part of Khaldoon's statement began with: \"Two wins in 11 Premier League games is clearly not in line with the targets that were agreed and set.\" That concentrated on the more recent performances, draws with Hull City, Bolton and Burnley, and leaves out of Hughes' average the four wins at the start. The most significant line was this: \"Sheikh Mansour and the board felt that there was no evidence that the situation would fundamentally change.\" That provided an answer from the owners in advance to the stories emanating from Eastlands that Brian Marwood, City's head of football administration, and chief executive, Garry Cook, were behind Hughes' ousting. Mansour and Khaldoon made their minds up for themselves. The spending spree over the summer, the sale of Elano who Hughes found a divisive influence and the overhaul of City's training facilities, concentrated the spotlight on Hughes and his coaching staff. The season began well, with the 4-2 victory over Arsenal on 12 September, in hindsight, both the high point and, following Emmanuel Adebayor's three-match ban for raking Robin van Persie, the watershed. When City began to stutter, it was not so much the draws as the manner of them which provoked concerns in Abu Dhabi: defensive dizziness, lack of cohesion and under-achievement of the biggest name players, Robinho and Adebayor. The view began to harden that something did have to change. Hughes had the same first-team coaching staff, including his former Welsh playing colleagues Mark Bowen, Eddie Niedzwiecki and Glyn Hodges, who have worked alongside him since he started out in management with his national team 10 years ago. In that, Hughes embodies old-style football man's loyalty, and he has stuck by his men, and their methods, throughout. From Abu Dhabi, Mansour and Khaldoon looked at their Premier League acquisition and considered that they had lavishly improved everything, the playing squad, training ground, stadium and all the supporting infrastructure \u2013 of which they believe Marwood's contribution to be a significant plus \u2013 but the one area which had stayed the same was Hughes and his coaching staff. They formed the view, which looks hasty to many in football but does not feel that way to them, that if they left Hughes in charge, the performances were not going to improve. They will say, still, that they wanted Hughes and his team to succeed, and City sources argue that Marwood and Cook gave the manager full support until Mansour's confidence was finally lost. The temptation for Khaldoon was always to replace the Welshman they inherited with an A-list European manager who might transform City into the Champions League club which Mansour and his money demand. In Roberto Mancini, Khaldoon and Cook believe they have that man. He, and they will today walk into scrutiny more intense than ever, after this December sacking of Hughes, a popular British football man."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
