Any more", "bodyText": "Friends and family have been emphatic for years whenever I\u2019ve asked: is it OK to have a favourite child? \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d is the usual, categorical consensus. I\u2019ve sometimes followed up with the question: \u201cOK, then, is it OK for me to have a favourite dog?\u201d The answer to that has usually been arrived at more quickly: \u201cOf course. So long as the favourite one doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s the favourite.\u201d (What if I had a favourite child and he/she didn\u2019t know either?) It\u2019s been two years since Nari, who was my favourite ever dog, died. I still feel the grief. I\u2019ll get teary some days when the sun reflects off her purple tag (screwed into the trunk of the towering gum beneath which she dug her final deep hole, in a back garden she\u2019d rip apart with regular defiance). I\u2019ll sometimes see another black labrador paddling way into the harbour after a ball. And I\u2019ll picture Nari out there defying the warnings from other doggy types that our girl, raised on the scent of foxes, snakes and \u2019roos in the Canberra bush, would surely fall prey to the Sydney bull sharks if she kept venturing so deep. \u201cLots of dogs have gone missing to the sharks around here,\u201d they\u2019d say with such regularity I eventually downloaded a shark app (it once reported Jaws in Bondi Junction, so I was sceptical of its accuracy). Three years later I\u2019m yet to see any evidence of a Noah taking a dog in inner-west waters. Then after barely a year in Sydney \u2013 whose sights, smells, parks, waters and dogs she relished \u2013 Nari was dead. For a pure-breed lab, Nari was fine-boned with an uneven coat that faded tawny in sun. She had the muscular chest and legs of a staffy. She remembered people and places and sounds. She had kind eyes and would gently nuzzle the back of your knee when she knew you were sad. She pulled on her lead until she died. She left a half-sister, Ronda, a beauty brimming with bitchy jealousy. I always thought her less intelligent (it\u2019s OK, she\u2019ll never read this!) but easier in many ways, even if her affections were transparently demanding and transactional. She was as lost as us when Nari, the unchallenged alpha, died. \u201cQuick \u2013 get another dog,\u201d we were told. No. Nothing could fill our Nari-shaped hole. Six months, a year, passed. We concentrated on loving Ronda. She became more neurotic, fretful and needy of me, whining and crying when I left her house. Were she a person, I\u2019d have considered a restraining order. She refused the ball, shunned the water. On the upside, the garden recovered (she\u2019d never dig or chew destructively!). In Nari\u2019s absence she seemed, unfairly I concede, to be diminishing in my eyes. Enter, last June, Olive, who we first held as a guinea pig-sized pup and brought home (she lay across my knees as I drove the Hume from Melbourne) as a tiny black and white, brown and blue-mottled six-week-old. She\u2019s a charismatic charmer, a bitzer and a bit: a blue-heeler-collie-cross with a dash of weimaraner. Inky fingerprints from the bluey gene seep through the snowy white of her coat. She is a ball of energy with her endless yabbering and snooping. It sometimes looks like she smiles. From the moment she entered the house and peed on the floor (and the carpets and sofas) she turned Ronda\u2019s life upside down in the battle for alpha ascendancy. She is feisty (hanging as a teeny pup by her jaws off Ronda\u2019s throat and ears and tail, and endlessly suckling her in vain) and clever (she soon repeatedly retrieved the same small, boomerang-shaped stone from wherever I\u2019d toss it down our sideway of thousands of small rocks). The garden suffered. We lost shoes. Now she\u2019s our shadow, curled in the armchair while I write nearby, or sitting on my feet while I cook. She gently nudges the backs of our knees, her touch gossamer soft and inquiring more than demanding. Ronda, meanwhile, has distanced herself. She\u2019s always in our orbit but not cloyingly so any more. Our dogs\u2019 lives are a rolling wrestling match, from the yard to my study, to the beach as the battle for alpha continues. I was certain Olive would quickly emerge top dog. But Ronda has asserted herself, claiming the mat by the back door, sometimes snatching the bone from Olive\u2019s jaws (infant Ronda attempted this once with Nari, who ripped open her snout with a vicious bite) and pinning the pup to the sand with jaws poised at her throat when she gets too much. I\u2019m smitten with Olive, who\u2019s now wading deep into bull shark territory after a stick, and who switches from pure octane to calm concentration as she stops to quietly, intently observe a bird or a butterfly, an image on the TV or one of her humans. She is fiercely territorial like Nari, barking should anyone enter our gate, or at strangers in our back lane. Ronda, who never barked, is now doing likewise. Ronda has also started wetting her paws in the harbour and sometimes chasing a ball. She\u2019ll never swim. But through death and renewal she\u2019s found herself. As we\u2019ve found her. My kids \u2013 who joke together about who is the favoured one \u2013 will not believe this: but I don\u2019t have a favourite dog or child. Any more. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
