An image of Johnny Depp rolling his shirt sleeves up while advertising a perfume named Sauvage has suddenly become a headache for Dior, while Nike, Evian and racket manufacturer Head are all pondering the solidity of their relationship with tennis star Maria Sharapova. Further afield in Hong Kong, protests were held outside Lanc\u00f4me stores over the company\u2019s cancellation of a concert by Canto-pop star Denise Ho Wan-sze, a known supporter of the pro-democracy movement . While Nike said it stood behind Sharapova, facing a two-year ban after admitting using a now banned performance-enhancing drug, Dior has so far refused to comment on allegations of domestic violence levelled by Depp\u2019s estranged wife Amber Heard, despite calls from anti-domestic violence groups. Earlier this month the British charity Women\u2019s Aid said that, should the allegations against Depp prove true, Dior should sever its relationship with the brand. \u201cA responsible fashion house would stop working with a perpetrator of domestic abuse,\u201d the charity said. \u201cThe \u2018hero culture\u2019 that can surround famous men should not distort our reactions to abusive actions.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Dior has run into difficulties. In 2008, then brand ambassador Sharon Stone said that an earthquake in China was the result of \u201cbad karma\u201d over the occupation of Tibet. Dior immediately withdrew Chinese advertising featuring the actress. Harvard brand professor John Quelch says brands have to go through a complex series of calculations when deciding how to react to trouble with celebrity endorsers. A brand such as Nike may be less sensitive to a consumer backlash because, clearly, Sharapova needs athletic wear to win tournaments, so the company\u2019s credibility remains intact. \u201cIf you have market power like Nike, you can set terms that are much tougher because athletes value the endorsementof Nike \u2013 it means as much to them as it does to the company. They feed off each other.\u201d But for brands that are increasingly seen as offering leadership around social issues, the dilemma around celebrities can still be acute. Quelch says Dior would almost certainly have written in a clause for moral turpitude in a contract with any Hollywood star. While a brand can\u2019t write in penalties for box-office flops, they can write a moral turpitude clause that is as broad and sweeping in its lack of definition as possible. \u201cSo whatever unforeseen misbehaviour arises, the moral turpitude clause can be activated,\u201d he says. By contrast, a powerful celebrity would seek to limit the moral turpitude clause to specified acts. \u201cThat might or might not include hitting your wife.\u201d But brands do not welcome celebrity endorsers who are likely to express their views on non-commercial issues. In Hong Kong, Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s parent company L\u2019Or\u00e9al was believed to have come under pressure from Chinese authorities to cancel Denise Ho Wan-sze\u2019s engagement over her pro-democracy stance. But the move proved to be a black eye for the firm as Ho urged fans to stand up against \u201cthe white terror that is spreading among our societies\u201d. In a statement, Lanc\u00f4me said Ho was not a spokesperson of the company and that it was \u201csorry for the confusion\u201d, citing \u201cpossible safety reasons\u201d in cancelling the concert. The social media and public backlash that followed L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s decision highlights difficulties that sponsors are now encountering with celebrity endorsers, says Lucie Greene, worldwide director of the Innovation Group at J Walter Thompson. \u201cCelebrities are sharing more opinions and pictures on social media to promote their own personal brands. It\u2019s becoming more difficult for brands to control celebrities that are tied into a brand relationship. They\u2019ve got their own independent ways to broadcast their ideas and thoughts.\u201d Whereas brands could once tightly control the messaging, says Greene, they now have to deal with several streams of commentary. \u201cIt\u2019s become far more important for celebrities to have a social media presence and the messages get picked up and spread more quickly.\u201d Exacerbating that trend, Greene adds, is the politicisation of social media users, including celebrities such as Lena Dunham, the American actor and creator of TV hit show Girls, who use their public platforms to draw attention to issues. In some instances, the importance for celebrities to maintain credibility with their audience is more important than their allegiance to sponsors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
