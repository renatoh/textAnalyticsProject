Following an inquiry cut short by plans for a general election, the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee called on ministers to move faster to reform the audit profession, strengthen corporate governance and curb executive pay. They said measures that could have achieved these aims had been suggested in the wake of other high-profile collapses such as that of outsourcing firm Carillion, but that the government had failed to take them forward. Business minister Andrea Leadsom also came in for criticism for her \u201clack of interest\u201d in the weeks leading up to Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, after the Guardian revealed she did not meet executives from the company as it teetered on the brink. Rachel Reeves, the committee chair, said: \u201cThe piling up of debt, confused business plans, lack of challenge in the boardroom and by auditors, and aggressive accounting practices all contributed to the failure of the business. \u201cThe failure at Thomas Cook has also been notable for the extraordinary lack of interest shown by the business department and its secretary of state in the days and weeks leading up to the collapse. \u201cIt is also a matter of fact that many of the necessary measures on audit, on executive pay, and on corporate governance have been sitting in the government\u2019s in-tray for months.\u201d In a letter to Leadsom, the committee made a series of recommendations to toughen up corporate governance, including stronger provisions to claw back bonuses from directors when companies fail. The MPs said they were disappointed that the government had not pressed ahead with plans to replace accounting regulator the Financial Reporting Council with a new body called the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority. Sir John Kingman, who led a review of the FRC, proposed the establishment of a new regulator nearly a year ago. He has since warned of the danger of \u201cdrift\u201d, after the government failed to draft legislation to implement his suggestions. \u201cReform of the [accounting] sector is urgently required, and we share Sir John Kingman\u2019s disappointment that proposals were not included in the Queen\u2019s speech,\u201d the committee wrote. They noted Leadsom\u2019s explanation that she was waiting for the conclusion of a separate review of the scope and quality of the audit profession by Sir Donald Brydon. But they were less forgiving with regard to Leadsom\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d lack of engagement with Thomas Cook prior to its failure. The Guardian revealed last month that she did not once speak to Thomas Cook executives during increasingly frantic talks between the company and its investors and regulators leading up to its collapse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
