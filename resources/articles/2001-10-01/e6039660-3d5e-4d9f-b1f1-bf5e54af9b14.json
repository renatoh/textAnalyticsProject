Instead of being entitled to subsidised \"soft\" loans which incur virtually no interest, most students would need to borrow money at commercial rates to help pay their living costs. The package would also see a maximum grant of \u00a32,600 to \u00a32,700 for students whose parents earn less than \u00a310,000. Many students would get a reduced grant and others would get none at all. Tuition fees would be abolished and all students would be liable to a graduate tax for 25 years under the scheme to pay for their higher education. No 10 has sided with the chancellor in drawing up the package against the Department for Education and Skills, which had been arguing for more sweeping and expensive reforms, according to well-placed government sources. One Whitehall source criticised the Treasury's plan as \"tinkering\" which would fail to deliver the radical, once-and-for-all reform required. He said: \"There has been some backtracking. The reins are being pulled in. It will leave a lot of people disappointed and let down and betrayed.\" The education department had been arguing for a maintenance grant for all students of around \u00a33,800 a year, repaid by a graduate tax of 3p in the pound over the same 25-year period. Soft loans would also be abolished under that scheme but supporters of that plan argue there would be no need for soft loans with a universal, fully funded maintenance grant. That scheme would also have given universities an extra \u00a3400m-\u00a3500m a year to help assuage their complaints about years of under-investment. Under the Treasury plan, the case for traditional, popular universities to impose top-up fees on students to fund extra investment would become unstoppable, said one source. Downing Street and the Treasury have anxieties about the initial costs of the new system, particularly in the wake of September 11, with the government being required to fund maintenance grants for three years without receiving any money through the graduate tax. Estelle Morris, the education secretary, is understood to have now accepted the Downing Street view. The 1997 decision to scrap grants and introduce tuition fees emerged as Labour's single most unpopular policy during the last election. The prime minister has accepted that without more help for poorer students, he will not reach his target of 50% of under-30s experiencing higher education by 2010. At the Labour party conference earlier this month, Tony Blair said: \"We have to find a better way to combine state funding and student contributions.\" The next day newspapers were briefed on Ms Morris's behalf that the government proposed to restore grants and make graduates liable for extra tax for up to 25 years. Since then Ms Morris has refused to shed any further light on the government's intentions. But the Guardian has learned that the education department was initially advocating the most radical option, of a grant even for better-off students. Downing Street first pre ferred a hybrid of means-tested grants and soft loans. That idea is off the agenda for now, dismissed as too complicated. Negotiations are continuing and the student finance review is due to report by the end of the year. Owain James, president of the National Union of Students, said last night: \"We welcome the fact that the government is prepared to look again at the system. They have to deliver more money and reverse some of the cuts to student support.\" But he predicted that scrapping all soft loans would be very unpopular with students."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
