Leeds's chairman Ken Bates dismissed The Cardiff manager Dave Jones' suggestion that Ridsdale, now deputy chairman at Cardiff, had been \"turned out\" of the United boardroom. \"It's a pack of lies, but I'm sure he needs the attention,\" was Bates' trenchant response. One insider hinted Ridsdale took offence when it was pointed out his celebration of Willo Flood's late winner for Cardiff might constitute inappropriate behaviour. Most would say the fact he was there at all was inappropriate in itself. Even if Ridsdale, in the face of all the evidence, genuinely believes his stewardship of the club to be unfairly maligned, common sense must tell him his presence in the Elland Road directors' box is inflammatory and does neither club any good at all. One can therefore only presume he doesn't have any. Leeds' manager Kevin Blackwell also referred to Ridsdale, albeit obliquely, in a post-match analysis which bore little relation to the turgid game just 18,246 supporters had witnessed. \"I'm not too concerned. Anyone who saw us at Palace last week will know we looked a good side, we dominated QPR, and though Cardiff are joint top, I thought we were the better team,\" he said. One point from those three games tells a different story. Asked whether he was satisfied he had enough good players to mount a promotion campaign, Blackwell talked about injuries and money. \"I think I've got enough, [players] but we haven't got the money while we're still paying people who aren't here any more. \"For the club to turn around \u00a3121m of debt in the time it has is phenomenal, and in 12 months we'll be able to compete with anybody as to who they want to sign.\" Cardiff played well enough on the break to suggest the play-offs may be in reach. Jones has assembled a promising group of what he describes as \"young, hungry, athletic and clever\" players, but he too will need to be lucky with injuries.
