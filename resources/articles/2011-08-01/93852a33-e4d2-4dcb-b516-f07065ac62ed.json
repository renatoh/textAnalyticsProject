There was the small issue of the first world war breaking out. And the time Hitler invaded Poland and precipitated the second world war. And Iraq invaded Kuwait. And the Berlin Wall went up. And that trifling matter a couple of years ago, when the entire world financial system teetered on the point of collapse. But apart from those tiny things, and the minor hiccups of this summer so far \u2013 the crashing economies of various European countries, the increasingly uncertain future of the eurozone, worldwide panic selling in the stockmarkets, America's fall from economic supremacy, and the teeny weeny spots of bother that have been occurring on our streets in the past week \u2013 it's really is just the perfect time to shut down parliament for a couple of months and pretend nothing's happening. Or, maybe, just possibly, in a globalised world, in half of which it's actually winter, the idea of a summer \"recess\" is about as up to date and relevant as a telephone box. It's a quaint idea, the silly season, a time of year in which no news happens and papers just print stories about Beyonc\u00e9's arse, but Beyonc\u00e9's arse is a year-round story these days, and this season has been about as silly as Henry Kissinger after a small glass of sherry. That is, not very silly at all. The summer has become the serious season. And none more so than this one, in which questions have been raised about more or less every aspect of society. Phone hacking? Remember that? And the worse than expected economic figures? The spectre of the double dip? And now, following the biggest mass outbreak of civil disobedience for three decades, what do we have? A quick debate in the chamber on Thursday \u2013 for which, it should be noted, MPs will be compensated for their amended travel plans, unlike the police whose leave has been cancelled \u2013 and the next time we'll see them is some time in September. Surely, there's a point to having MPs, in which case, why aren't they doing what we pay them to do? Or there isn't, and we should just ship in a job lot of ex-laboratory monkeys and see how they get on. The idea that it's helpful to have a functioning democracy during the colder, winter months but not so much when the sun is out is just patently absurd. And while, no doubt, there are a few MPs who spend the full seven weeks sweating it out in their constituency offices answering questions about toilet-roll provisioning at their local community centres, most of them aren't. As they aren't during their three weeks off at Easter, their two weeks off at Whitsun, their three weeks off at Christmas, their half-terms, their conference recesses\u2026 But it's the summer that is the biggest problem. It really isn't quite like it was in Jane Austen's day, when European nations politely agreed not to commence hostilities against one another, and all civilised folk removed themselves to the country and stayed there until a damp chill entered the air. These days, most of us are engaged in what is termed \"work\". We have these thingies we call \"jobs\". A holiday entitlement of 20 weeks a year is what's usually known as \"unheard of\" or, if you watch Jeremy Kyle, \"long-term unemployment\". The world does not stop turning come July. It really doesn't. Every organisation in Britain knows this, it's why we fill out holiday forms, and wheeler-deal with colleagues over who can go when. But still, come back from your Tuscan villas and lecture us on morality. Tell us about the values of hard work and decency. Stress the importance of paying for what you receive (second home allowances and the John Lewis list notwithstanding). No, really. We're all ears. Wikipedia shows life, Jim, but not as we women know it There are known knowns, known unknowns, and then there's unknown unknowns. Or to put it another way, stuff that isn't on Wikipedia. Which, it turns out, is more or less anything that doesn't much interest men. Because research published by the University of Minnesota proved what has been known anecdotally for a while: Wikipedia, the \"free encyclopaedia that can be edited by anyone\", is almost entirely male. Researchers studied self-reported information from 110,000 editors between 2005 and 2011, and discovered that only 16% of them were women. What's more, they made just 9% of edits. And were \"significantly more likely to have their early contributions undone by their fellow editors, and are more likely to be indefinitely blocked by fellow editors\". Back in January, the New York Times reported on a study the Wikimedia Foundation had itself done into gender balance on Wikipedia, noting that while \"Sex and the City includes only a brief summary of every episode, sometimes two or three sentences; the one on The Sopranos includes lengthy, detailed articles on each episode\". There is an argument that the world needs less, rather than more, information about Carrie Bradshaw's shoes, and Wikipedia is actually providing a rather useful service. But it's possibly difficult to make the same claim about the discrepancy between the article on \"menstruation\", which is 2,258 words long and has 20 footnotes, and the one on Star Trek, which is 7,558 words long and has 71 footnotes plus 17 references. And shouldn't be confused with the articles on \"Star Trek: The Original Series\", \"Star Trek: The Animated Series\", \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", \"Star Trek (film series)\" and \"Star Trek spin-off fiction\". But then history is written by the victors. And men are winning. In every country in the world, they earn more money, and wield more power, and make more laws. It makes perfect sense that they should also control the sum of all human knowledge. Or at least the version of it school pupils are most likely to plagiarise. A version in which \"gender inequality\" is about half as important (3,697 words, 31 references) as \"William Shatner\" (6,215 words, 58 references). Kate and Zelda: the beautiful and the damned First there was Victoria Beckham's decision to name her new baby after Harper Lee, the great American novelist whose To Kill a Mocking Bird, with its themes of social exclusion and institutionalised racism, so inspired the Beckhams in their quest to end world poverty and campaign for greater social justice for all. Or something like that. But now comes news of another great celebrity-literary connection. According to a breathless account in American Vogue of Kate Moss's wedding, the inspiration for the day was The Great Gatsby. Well, of course it was. Because as a celebration of all the fun bits of capitalism, and the great things that come from rich people pratting around burning up money produced from other people's labour, The Great Gatsby is unequivocally positive, no? But then the inspiration for Kate's dress came, we learn, from Zelda Fitzgerald. A heroine to Kate, it transpires, and to us all. Because what's not to love about Zelda? Her union with Scott Fitzgerald is one of the great marital success stories of all time and an inspiration to all, notwithstanding alcoholism (his), suicide attempts (hers), schizophrenia (hers), internment in a mental asylum (hers again), possible homosexual affair with Ernest Hemingway (his), and eventual death, being burned alive after being unable to escape from a locked sanitorium room while awaiting electric shock therapy (hers). I know. It's just too romantic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
