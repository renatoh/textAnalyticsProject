The socialist John McDonnell \u2013 often caricatured as a factionalist worthy of the People's Front of Judea \u2013 has shown he is something better, by withdrawing his pitch to be Labour leader to get his fellow leftist, the late-night TV pundit Diane Abbott, on to the ballot. Harriet Harman did her bit too, nominating without endorsing Ms Abbott, and the party now has a female alternative to the four white hopefuls, who are all former special advisers in their early 40s. The role David Miliband played \u2013 lending Ms Abbott his own vote, and those of his undeclared followers \u2013 was a brave one. It proves he is not just someone who talks about a new pluralism, but someone willing to do real things, and run real risks, to open up the debate. At the New Statesman hustings last night, the former foreign secretary did not emerge as a Blairite, but as someone who was nonetheless set on putting up a reasoned defence of New Labour's overall record. The sudden entry from stage left had a more marked effect on the pitch of his younger brother, Ed, who last night sharpened up his previously hazy claim to be a smidgen more radical. He branded Iraq a straightforward mistake and expressed a newfound interest in finding a cut-price deterrent which is cheaper than Trident. Both moves will serve him well, although the rapturous applause Ms Abbott repeatedly won from this Labour audience suggests she will continue to shake up this whole race for some time to come. Ms Abbot has often been wrong, and rebels so casually that some loyalists ask whether she is on their side at all. That may in time undermine her pitch. Her critique of what went before may be less pertinent to Labour's chances than the analysis \u2013 pushed by both Ed Balls and Andy Burnham last night \u2013 about how the last government grew out of touch with working-class voters. She revealed last night, however, that when she walks away from Andrew Neil's sofa and steps on to the podium, she has some serious things to say \u2013 not least on civil liberties, which as a black woman, she well understands are not the purely middle-class issue that her rivals sometimes suggest. Labour remains weary and wounded by defeat. But from the banks to social care, it is not merely that party, it is Britain as a whole that stands in dire need of fresh thinking to challenge failed orthodoxies. None of the contenders have so far articulated it, but by short-circuiting nomination rules that were drawn up during Labour's long years of control-freakery, the party's high command has at least shown itself to be up for the discussion. They have also given us all a contest worth watching \u2013 instead of a summer-long snooze."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
