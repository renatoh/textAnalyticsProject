Chances are, it\u2019ll be Alex Prager. The Los Angeles-based artist is often on the lookout for those with a distinctive look to include in her hyper-colour, hyper-stylised photographs and short films. Recently she spotted a young French boy having lunch with his mother. \u201cI knew that if I left the cafe before asking him to be in the film that I would regret it forever because he looked so cool. Now he\u2019s one of my go-to characters.\u201d Prager\u2019s first Australian solo exhibition has just opened at the National Gallery of Victoria. With intricate staging, meticulous attention to detail and inescapable creepiness, her work is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock or David Lynch, her glamorous noir-esque heroines dying horrible deaths by drowning, falling out of windows or suffering excruciating loneliness. The NGV exhibition includes 25 major works, including three newly acquired by the gallery. For Prager, it\u2019s almost a mini-retrospective, spanning her early photographs from 2008 right through to her latest series Face in the Crowd, which was exhibited at Art Basel art fair last year. Seeing it all together, she can appreciate the evolution of her work and some of the themes she\u2019s explored. \u201cFor me, as an artist, [it\u2019s about] trying to keep myself challenged and evolving. It\u2019s showing me that I am moving forward so that part is good.\u201d It\u2019s a long way from her first show in an LA hair salon in 2001. The self-taught Prager picked up a camera in her early 20s after seeing an exhibition of the US photographer William Eggleston\u2019s work. She started with street photography but quickly moved to styling her friends in wigs and vintage Hollywood starlet getups and shooting them. Growing up in Hollywood meant artifice and glamour have always been part of Prager\u2019s world and heightened drama often features in her work. \u201cPeople can be murdered and there can be all kinds of violence and horrible seedy things going underneath all that glamour and people will still watch it and love it.\u201d She uses saturated colour for the same reason. \u201cI thought it added this strange lie on top of the truth that I thought was just a little bit creepier and more interesting to work with. When it\u2019s over the top with saturation and blue skies and bright red lips, over-the-top Kodachrome, I think it plays into our nostalgia and our familiarity \u2026 but do we really know what\u2019s going in that picture? It\u2019s always that thing that throws you off balance.\u201d Making short films was a natural progression, Prager says, after she noticed audiences asking for the backstory to the images. Video works including Sunday (2010) and Despair (2010) got plenty of attention and in 2012 she made an Emmy award-winning series of short films with the New York Times entitled Touch of Evil featuring Ryan Gosling, Jessica Chastain, Rooney Mara and others. Face In the Crowd is her most ambitious series, including large-scale photographs of staged crowd scenes and an immersive video installation. It was an epic shoot in every way, says Prager, with 350 extras, 150 crew members, four rotating sets and a tight schedule across four days. She directed the sea of extras by giving some specific characters, some photographic references and asking others to improvise. \u201cYou really feel like you are not quite sure what world you are in, if it\u2019s real or if it\u2019s fake and I think that\u2019s something we can relate to in the world that we are living in right now.\u201d The video installation stars the actor Elizabeth Banks wading through unrelenting crowds. Although her work often centres on a heroine, Prager says it\u2019s not about women as much as about emotions she\u2019s keen to explore. Using female characters is her way of being honest about a topic, she says, because she\u2019s female. \u201cI don\u2019t know how men feel in the same way that I know how a woman feels. The emotional aspect is so important to me, that it rings true and that it\u2019s honest. On top of it, you can put all the glamour and the stylisation and the facade of everything else, but underneath it, there has to be something real, otherwise I just don\u2019t think I would be able to look at i; I don\u2019t think it would feel right to me.\u201d The artist adds a dose of reality by including family and friends in the shoots. She laughingly dubs her sister, the artist Vanessa Prager, her \u201cWaldo\u201d as she appears in all her work. \u201cAll these strangers walking around me, all in costumes, who knows who anyone is? Then I see my sister in there, and I know exactly who she is because we\u2019re so close \u2013 it puts that bit of reality into the pictures.\u201d Her next exhibition will be in Hong Kong at Lehmann Maupin in March, then she\u2019ll begin on new work. Surely she\u2019ll follow her Hitchcockian and Lynchian influences and make a feature film soon? \u201cI haven\u2019t even done a film with dialogue yet so I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the obvious next step,\u201d she says with a laugh. But it might be on the cards: \u201cIf you had asked me 10 years ago if I was going to do even a short film, I would have probably said no, so who knows what is going to happen in the future. I\u2019m kind of open for anything at this point.\u201d \u2022 Alex Prager runs from 14 November to 19 April at the National Gallery of Victoria"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
