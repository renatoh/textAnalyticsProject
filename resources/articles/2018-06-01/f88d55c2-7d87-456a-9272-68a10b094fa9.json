For more on how to interpret the theme, keep an eye on the comments. You have until 11pm on Monday 2 July to post your nomination and make your justification. Regular RR contributor George Boyland (who posts as sonofwebcore in the comments) will select from your recommendations and produce our list, which will be published on 24 May. Here is a list of all songs previously picked and therefore ineligible for the series. If you want to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions \u2013 and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian \u2013 please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line \u201cRR guru\u201d, or make yourself known in the comments. Here\u2019s a reminder of the guidelines for RR: Tell us why it\u2019s a worthy contender. Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song\u2019s words. If sharing links, make sure there is appropriate copyright permission. Listen to others people\u2019s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist. If you have a good theme, or if you\u2019d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com There\u2019s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \u201czedded\u201d, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of \u201czedded\u201d (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), \u201cdonds\u201d and other strange words used by RR regulars. Many RR regulars also congregate at the \u2019Spill blog."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
