Scorn", "bodyText": "ANOTHER FINE MESS? As the self-respecting charlatan's charlatan, the Fiver's long been looking to make a quick buck. A rich, silver-haired publishing magnate never having found our dingy corner of GU Towers, we've had to wait until now for our chance: we're off to Bulgaria, to set-up a jewellery stall (sovereign rings a speciality) outside CSKA Sofia's stadium. After the racist abuse received by black Liverpool players in last night's Big Cup clash, we reckon all that knuckle-dragging should see us retiring in the sun within months. \"It's hurtful,\" said Djibril Cisse, Lord of the Manor of Frodsham and the target of Sofia fans' baser urges. \"It's a shame, but there are lots of stupid people sometimes at these games and as a player you can't do anything about it.\" He's right. It seems no amount of player action will keep Uefa blazers away from matches these days, but we can certainly expect them to steer clear of this latest opportunity to kick wristban ... sorry, racism out of football. In the last few years, Graeme Souness alone has notched up \u00a340,000 in FA fines for telling a shoddy referee a bit about himself - eventually ditching his moustache because he couldn't afford its upkeep. Lord Ferg of Purple-cheeks had to cough up nearly \u00a35,000 for suggesting the Big Cup draw was fixed a couple of years back, while Celtic were fined \u00a32,300 by Uefa after a fan \"provoked\" El-Hadji Diouf into gobbing all over him. Meanwhile in the far less heinous world of white supremacism, Luis Aragones was forced to pluck \u00a32,000 from his money clip for calling Thierry Henry a \"black sh*t\", Atletico Madrid found themselves a whopping \u00a3420 out of pocket after fans made monkey noises at Roberto Carlos, and Albacete were docked the same amount when fans abused Samuel Eto'o - a fine that was later halved on appeal. Such slaps on the wrist are not exactly what we'd call prohibitive action, which is a shame, especially as the Fiver went to an awful lot of trouble to find out what that phrase means. * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Joey has come back in and will fight for a place in the team\" - an unfortunate turn of phrase from Manchester City boss Stuart Pearce, who has named Joey Barton in his squad for Saturday's season-opener against West Brom ... alongside Richard Dunne. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Gymnastic genius Lomana LuaLua has pleaded with Portsmouth not to sell him. Spurs, who hope to make him their 68th summer signing, and Monaco are keen. Pompey, meanwhile, plan to go back to the Greek well once again and pinch Sotrios Kyrgiakos from Panathinaikos as a replacement for Arjan de Zeeuw. Fabrice Fernandes is being lured back to the Premiership by Big Sam, who clearly thinks the '1977' on the Southampton midfielder's birth certificate is a typo. Both West Ham and Man City are positioning themselves as close to Joleon Lescott's bizarro-Gerrard forehead as possible, after the Wolves defender rejected a new contract. And Newcastle Comedy Club have pulled alongside Middlesbrough in the \u00a36m race to sign Sporting Lisbon's Rudolphe Douala, the man who helped dump both clubs out of Euro Vase last season. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Disorganised chaos abounds in Italy, where the start of the season looks like being delayed for a fourth season on the trot due to financial problems and the fall-out of the recent match-fixing scandal. Cesc Fabregas, Arsenal's one successful signing from Spain, has stamped his autograph on a contract to keep him at the club until 2011. The England casualties are already being totted up: Ledley King will miss next week's friendly against Denmark with a groin strain. * * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS \"Am I the only one to wonder why Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr doesn't sneak into Zinedine Zidane's bedroom, hide under the bed and tell him to go back into retirement? Ideally Lilian Thuram and Claude Makelele will follow suit\" - David O'Callaghan. \"I can't imagine what all the fuss is about in calling most teams in the Premiership mediocre. After all, Jean Giraudoux [French dramatist who developed an antiheroic attitude of comic irony - patronising Fiver Ed] is purported to have said that 'only the mediocre are always at their best!' And I bet many a manager wishes they had said that\" - Chris English. \"Unbeknownst to many, Maradona has already been portrayed on the silver screen by the inimitable Ron Jeremy, in the little known Italian bongo-flick S*x World Cup. I wonder if the similarities extend beyond their ever-expanding guts?\" - Andrew Shrubb. \"Can I nominate Eddie Large to play the cheating, drug-fuelled, smaller-than-life, Latin love machine? If they come only as a pair, Sid Little could play Peter Beardsley and possibly Peter Reid too, still trying to catch the little cheat\" - Pat Porter. \"When are these lemmings of Newcastle-bashing Fiver readers going to come up with something original? No one thought of the comedy club gag until two weeks ago when everyone got sick of Bongo FC. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with chop-Souey clearing out the dead wood. Just a pity that only leaves us with, er, no wood\" - Jon Howey, Rotterdam [An absence of wood wouldn't go down well at Bongo FC - Fiver Ed]. \"Re: Matt Stephenson's thinly-veiled attack on Rangers yesterday. There is only one Scottish pub team left in Big Cup and it's not yours, mate!\" - Gavin Kean. \"Good to see in yesterday's Fiver that the 'honk!' count was back up again after a lengthy absence. Your standards had been getting too high for far too long - it couldn't last!\" - Chris Scott. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

So [Fiver tinks spoon against champagne flute] without further ado, please be upstanding for Graham Russell. Five: John Barnes's Football Night (12am) \"A few years ago I attended a wedding in Yorkshire,\" begins Graham, conjuring up images of a Woolpack full of James Herriotts, Geoffrey Boycotts and other no-nonsense whippet-worriers saying \"'Ot dinner and entertainers? Eeh by gum!\" Sky Sports 1: Premier League Review (6pm) \"Having not visited this part of the north before, I was more than impressed with the way the locals were able to put away their beer,\" continues Graham, neglecting to mention whether or not he's a southern pansy. Football League Review (7pm) \"By the time the speeches began, however, it was clear that the best man was relaxed to say the least. Premiership Years (11pm) \"Instead of politely thanking the father of the bride for laying on the do, he decided to reveal that the proud dad had funded the wedding by defrauding the local post office.\" Sky Sports Xtra: Fifa Futbol Mundial (12.30am) Oh dear. Still, it could have been worse, eh? British Eurosport: Big Cup (8.15pm) \"Even more startling was his revelation that the groom's brother had been 'having it away' with the bride.\" BBC Radio Five Live: Sport On Five (5.20pm) Oh jayzus ... Talksport: Kick-Off (7pm) \"The police arrived fairly promptly to break up the ensuing punch-up, but the happy couple were no longer together by the time the bride's father had his day in court.\" Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off the ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) A fine start to our latest riff and no mistake.
