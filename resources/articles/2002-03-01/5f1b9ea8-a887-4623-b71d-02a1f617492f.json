If so, have you any advice regarding currency exchange, passport control and so on. David Byrns, Birmingham Slovenia is a real treasure chest - half the size of Switzerland but packed with stunning mountain vistas, character-filled harbour towns, gorges and caves. It's easy to get to from Venice and Trieste (another budget destination that's an accessible gateway to the region with Ryanair), with trains on the Venice to Budapest line passing through Ljubljana several times daily. A single from Venice will cost around \u00a316. When you're in Slovenia, it won't be hard to fill the time - the relaxed pace and low numbers of tourists in Ljubljana, Ptuj and Skofja will seem like a tonic after Venice, and the Lakes of Bled and Bohinj are rightly popular areas. If you fancy stretching your legs, the Triglav National Park contains a wide variety of trails suitable for all, allowing you to get among the Julian Alps. If walking isn't your thing, you can try rafting, caving or canyoning. Visas won't be a problem as you'll be allowed in for 30 days without one, and crossing the border, especially by train, should be a formality. The tolar (about 370 to the pound) is the local currency, and it'll be easy to get money using the ubiquitous ATMs, but you'll also find euros widely accepted. Do be careful with exchange rates. The Slovenian Tourist Board can offer more on 020 7287 7133. Slow boat to Brisbane I read your article on the Trans-Siberian Railway (20 January) and in 2003, I propose to travel from Moscow to Vladivostok, or maybe Beijing, and thence to Australia. I would like to arrange passage on a cargo ship to Brisbane; have you any suggestions as to how I might do this? I expect to have travelling companions and I am an impecunious pensioner, hoping to do all this on a shoestring! Tessa Alger, Derby This ocean journey is possible, with some forward planning. A container ship that accepts passengers travels from Shanghai to Brisbane via Japan. The age limit on board is 79, and passenger numbers are very limited, so get this arrangement in place and then book a rail journey to coincide with sailing. Strand Travel (020 7836 6363) can arrange passage; you'll also need to book early. The bad news is a freighter journey is anything but shoestring: generally you'll pay about \u00a360 for each day on board and it'll take you between two to three weeks to complete this trip, so it's safe to say you won't see much change out of \u00a31,000 each. It'll be easy to continue on to Shanghai once you're in Beijing. Your cheapest bet - unromantic yet speedy - will be to fly to Australia. Tickets generally cost between \u00a3370 and \u00a3450 from Shanghai and Beijing to Sydney and from there on to Brisbane. Personally, if I had the extra cash, I'd take the boat, if only as a once-in-a-lifetime trip! Island-hopping I am planning to go to the Caribbean for a month in mid-April. I have heard you can buy a ticket which allows you to island-hop. Can you give me any information on this please? Tina Arena, by email LIAT (formerly Leeward Islands Air Transport) offers the most extensive range of destinations in the eastern Caribbean. Booking is straightforward once you're out there, or can be booked with your transatlantic flight. A variety of air passes are available, the most extensive being the Caribbean Super Explorer which costs \u00a3335 for 30 days' unlimited travel, provided you don't visit the same place twice. The Explorer Pass allows you to visit any three islands in 21 days. You can also take ferries between some islands. Island hopping, part two I am planning to take my wife to Greece for a week's holiday at the end of May. We will be backpacking and would like to go island-hopping. Is there a ferry travel pass available, and which islands do you recommend? Rafael and Tania Morales, Tunbridge Wells Due to the plethora of ferry companies, there's no one-size-fits-all ticket to get you on to any boat. Tickets, if you're a foot passenger, are usually bought on the day of travel. Routes and summer schedules can be found on www.ferries.gr, though you should check this at each departure point as they can change at short notice. With a week you could comfortably explore a group of islands. If starting in Athens, a few days in the Cyclades, taking in Santorini, Syros's ancient sites and a few days on the beach at Amorgos or Sifnos, is a possible plan, as is heading north from Athens to Evia, Skopelos and Skiathos. If you're flexible about your starting point you could see some of the Dodecanese including Rhodes, or explore Crete. Your timing is good - most operators should be starting up their summer schedules towards the beginning of June, though it won't yet be too hot or busy. Also, try www.greekislandhopping.com. Secrets of Pompeii I'd like to visit Pompeii and other archaeological sites within the area. What would be the best time to visit these places? Are there any operators that specialise in holidays in that area? Eileen Sutch, Manchester Pompeii is Italy's most popular tourist attraction with more than 1.5 million visitors each year. The best time to go is between April and June when prices are lower. Try to avoid July and August when it's hot, busy and expensive. Andante Travels (01722 713800) runs an eight-day Pompeii, Herculaneum &amp; Classical Campania tour that costs \u00a31,095. The company is owned and managed by archaeologists and the tours are led by academics, travel writers, lecturers etc - all specialists in their particular field. All entry fees are included in the price. If you decide to visit independently, you should allow at least four hours to see Pompeii. Beware of unofficial guides offering guided tours; authorised guides wear identification tags and will usually work for one of three companies (Asso Touring, Casting or Gata). For further information, contact the Italian Tourist Board (020 7408 1254). \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall and Rachel Suddart from Lonely Planet address as many as possible here. Email travel.tips@observer.co.uk or write to Escape, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. The writer of the week's star letter wins a Lonely Planet guidebook of their choice (so include a daytime telephone number and postal address).
