Derek Bennett died after being shot four times when he was challenged by two armed police officers in Brixton, south London, in July 2001. An inquest found the officers acted lawfully, but yesterday the high court ruled the coroner had made a series of errors and gave Mr Bennett's family permission to challenge the verdict. Police firearms officers are already dismayed by the legal scrutiny their colleagues have endured in the Harry Stanley case, where an unarmed man was shot dead by marksmen who mistook a table leg for a gun. Scores of armed officers refused to carry weapons last year after the two officers in that case were suspended when an inquest jury decided they had unlawfully killed Mr Stanley. The two officers are waiting to hear if they will face criminal charges. In the case of Mr Bennett, 29, police were called after he was seen with a gun-shaped, silver cigarette lighter on a council estate. At the original inquest the officer who fired the fatal shots said Mr Bennett had not pointed the lighter at police, and said he had fired after a \"hostage\" broke free. Yesterday Mr Justice Sullivan gave Mr Bennett's family permission to seek a judicial review. He ruled that the inquest conducted by the Southwark coroner, Selena Lynch, was flawed. Mr Bennett's brother, Daniel, 35, said: \"Obviously we are glad to get this permission. We said from the outset we were unhappy that the coroner did not leave a verdict of unlawful killing to the jury.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
