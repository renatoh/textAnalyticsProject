Ben Stephenson, who will leave the BBC this week to join Star Wars director JJ Abrams\u2019 production company Bad Robot in the US, said the licence fee had to be increased otherwise the BBC and the country would be \u201cthe poorer for it\u201d. Stephenson, speaking before Tory MP John Whittingdale\u2019s appointment as David Cameron\u2019s new culture secretary, said: \u201cIt really can\u2019t keep cutting \u2026 and the truth is the market isn\u2019t going to fill the gap of the BBC. \u201cThere will be less drama and fewer jobs. It doesn\u2019t make sense on an economic level. We do need to increase the licence fee. \u201cThere isn\u2019t TV in this country, there is the BBC. It wasn\u2019t TV that started, it was the BBC. Someone invented the TV but it was the BBC that invented British television. You can\u2019t just pull the rug from under that and think that nothing is going to change. And the BBC will be the poorer for it.\u201d Stephenson, whose other credits include The Missing, Line of Duty, Call the Midwife and The Fall, told the new issue of Radio Times: \u201cWe are funded less than we were in 2000. That\u2019s not a moan, it\u2019s a fact. \u201cSo you look at your slate in a different way \u2013 it\u2019s a reason why you don\u2019t have lots of 10- or 20-part runs. You make the money go further by having lots of different dramas. But we are at a tipping point.\u201d Whittingdale, the former chair of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, has described the BBC licence fee as \u201cworse than poll tax\u201d and said the \u00a3145.50 charge was unsustainable in the long term. However, he has also said the licence fee would survive for another decade. Stephenson dismissed Osborne\u2019s comments last month that BBC drama was being left behind in the US dominated box-set market and that it should \u201crun with our successes\u201d more by producing longer runs of shows. Stephenson suggesting BBC1\u2019s recent Sunday night hit Poldark could run for another five series, covering all 12 of Winston Graham\u2019s novels. But he told the magazine: \u201cThe truth is the British system is the British system and the US has the US system. \u201cBoth are brilliant, but financially we are not a country that can make 24-part runs. I believe it would be foolhardy. If you do 24 episodes of one thing you can\u2019t do others. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t make Happy Valley and The Missing. The budget of BBC2 drama is under \u00a330m a year. We could make one 24-part series, and then all the other writers wouldn\u2019t be employed. \u201cIf we did 13 episodes of Sherlock a year it would swallow most of our budget and it would be worse at 13 episodes. \u201cAnd Benedict Cumberbatch wouldn\u2019t do it. We wouldn\u2019t do it. It isn\u2019t what Britain is. We will do Sherlock as long as the talent want to do it. It\u2019s such a compliment that Benedict and Martin Freeman want to do it. They don\u2019t need to do it. They love the roles.\u201d He added: \u201cSometimes there is a view that mainstream is a dirty word and you have to speak down to an audience. But people want stories they can really connect with.\u201d BBC director general has already moved to bulk up BBC1\u2019s drama budget by spending \u00a330m that will be saved under controversial plans to close the BBC3 TV channel on the main channel\u2019s drama output. The BBC Trust is due to rule on the proposed closure, taking the BBC3 brand online only, later this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
