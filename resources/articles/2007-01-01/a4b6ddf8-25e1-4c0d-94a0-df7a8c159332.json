There is, after all, a vast wealth of empirical evidence to suggest it's a bad idea to temporarily release yourself from the creative shackles of collaboration and let loose with the ideas that you can't get past your bandmates. Said empirical evidence stretches back to 1968, the year George Harrison and John Lennon both decided to release themselves from their creative shackles and ended up foisting an album of meandering synthesiser doodles called Wonderwall Music, and Two Virgins - an indispensable recording of John Lennon and Yoko Ono walking around and muttering at each other - on a nonplussed public. As recent efforts from Thom Yorke and Manic Street Preacher James Dean Bradfield have demonstrated, extracurricular solo albums are the spin-off series of rock. The best you can usually hope for is Torchwood (uneven, indulgent, passes the time without ever being a patch on the definitive article); the worst you can fear is some foul musical equivalent of The Green Green Grass, so hopeless it makes you wonder what anyone saw in the thing it was spun off from. When the thing it's spun off from is the Super Furry Animals, it gives you further pause for thought. Uniquely for an alt-rock band that emerged during Britpop's salad days, the Welsh quintet's problem has never been a limited musical vision - alone among their guitar-slinging peers, they successfully integrated a techno influence into their sound - but an inability to marshal their wealth of ideas. For every inventive moment in their back catalogue, there's a dose of marijuana-fuelled self-indulgence: the idea of a solo album from frontman Gruff Rhys, containing stuff that didn't make it through their wonky quality control, is hardly one to set the heart racing. So it proved with his 2005 release, Yr Atal Genhedlaeth, the marginal nature of its slight songs underlined by their titles, a series of puns so torturous that they required explication even for Welsh speakers. That his second solo album arrives heralded by a YouTube video for the title track based on old children's programmes - equal parts Fingerbobs and Watch! - seems another gloomy portent. At first glance, it appears to be another example of the stoner humour that has always been Super Furry Animals' most wearying weakness, this time of the teehee-who-remembers-Captain-Pugwash? variety. But then something odd happens. The video's recreation of the atmosphere of 1970s kids TV is so lovingly done, so forensic in its detail, that it doesn't look like a parody at all: in fact, if you're of a certain age, watching it is a strangely haunting experience. The latter is an adjective that you could apply to most of Candylion. A third of it is taken up by the closing Skylon!, which appears to set out the album's raison d'etre to a four-note riff that sounds like a pastoral version of the Velvet Underground's Sister Ray. Ostensibly the story of a bomb disposal expert's finest hour, it lists present-day ills - terrorism, \"mediocre movies and frivolous magazines\" among them - countering them with a chorus of \"I define myself against everything you stand for.\" Rhys' answer to 21st-century ennui seems to be retreat into forgotten areas of the past. The song's titular protagonist is named after the piece of futuristic architecture built for, then scrapped after, the 1951 Festival 0f Britain, while the rest of Candylion makes capital from dimly remembered musical flotsam: indeed, the Pentangle-ish, double-bass-driven acid-folk that fuel Now the Feeling Has Gone and Painting People Blue counts as the album's least arcane influence. The opening This Is Just the Beginning offers a synthesised fanfare that could have been swiped from an early 1980s regional news show. The cantering rhythms, swiftly-plucked acoustic guitar and wordless, high-pitched female vocals of Lonesome Words recall the sort of music that used to introduce European children's drama serials bought cheaply by the BBC. The Court of King Arthur, meanwhile, perversely pares a glam-rock stomp down to acoustic bare bones, the better to express the singer's love of archaeology. All this would count merely as evidence that Gruff Rhys owns a lot of weird old records, were it not for the fact that the songwriting is of a remarkably high standard. Skylon! aside, it's admirably concise, taking the outr\u00e9 influences and distilling them into neat three-minute packages. Even the weaker songs wing it on charm alone. Candylion isn't a major musical statement, but its idiosyncratic, nostalgic appeal is hard to resist. More importantly, it has a reason for existing beyond providing ego-massage for the man who made it: more than you can say for most extracurricular solo albums. Against all odds, Candylion turns out to be a rather rare beast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
