The channel can show full delayed coverage or highlights at any time following the final whistle in Istanbul after Sky accepted a cash offer. The match kicks off at 6pm BST. The Football Association declined its share of the tickets for the October 11 match in Istanbul after 95 arrests were made following England's 2-0 win over Turkey in Sunderland in April. The minister for sport, Richard Caborn, recently requested that BSkyB, which paid \u00a33m for exclusive rights to the match, cede delayed coverage to a terrestrial channel. Caborn believed that might help persuade fans tempted to travel to stay home, thus reducing the potential for crowd trouble. Last night Caborn, welcoming the deal, said: \"This is such an important game for England and I am delighted that the widest possible audience will be able to see it on the day it happens.\" ITV must now decide whether reorganisation of its Saturday night scheduling will favour showing the match in full or as highlights. Whichever it chooses, the channel is expected to use the match to promote to football fans its coverage of the rugby World Cup and the following day's Japanese grand prix. The Turkish federation has urged its own fans to behave \"like gentlemen\" during the match in Istanbul's Sukru Saracoglu stadium. A statement said: \"While our players are making history on the pitch we fully believe our fans in the stands should support them continuously and act like gentlemen. Our only wish is that Turkish soccer, along with the fans and media, end this game with honour and we witness another night of victory.\" England's selection concerns have been exacerbated by the possibility that the Everton forward Wayne Rooney will not have started a full first-team game for three weeks before the tie. The fitness of England's captain David Beckham is already open to question after he was injured playing for Real Madrid on Saturday. Rooney has been left on the bench for the last two Everton games and may not start at Tottenham on Saturday His last full match was Everton's defeat at Middlesbrough on September 21. The Everton manager David Moyes is not under pressure to recall Rooney to his starting line-up after last Sunday's 4-0 win over Leeds. Moyes's attacking options have been enhanced by the return to action of Kevin Campbell and Francis Jeffers in Monday's reserve defeat by Liverpool. Campbell, the former Nottingham Forest and Arsenal striker, ended six weeks out with a hamstring injury by playing the full 90 minutes of Monday's reserve game. He said : \"I felt great. There are no problems with the hamstring and it was really good to get my first 90 minutes under my belt.\" Moyes said: \"Kevin is not far away from coming back because he is naturally fit and keeps himself in good condition. Both he and Jeffers had looked like they needed a game to get them ready.\" A decision is expected on October 17 on the outstanding compulsory purchase orders needed to progress Arsenal's Ashburton Grove project. The start of work on the stadium rests on a positive decision from Yvette Cooper, a junior planning minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
