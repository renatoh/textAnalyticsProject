Melanie Leupolz opened the scoring inside 15 minutes, heading home from a corner. Sara D\u00e4britz added a second after goalkeeper Andile Dlamini could only parry Alexandra Popp\u2019s cross into her path. Popp, who had missed a golden opportunity soon after Leupolz\u2019s opener, added a third before half time. Dlamini atoned for her error in the second half with a fine save from Leubolz\u2019s header, and was unlucky when her fingertip save from Marina Hegering bounced off the far post, turned in by Lina Magull. Thembi Kgatlana missed an opportunity to add a consolation for eliminated South Africa, while Germany had two late goals disallowed for offside. In the other Group B game, China got the point they needed to secure qualification in third place, despite being dominated by Spain. Peng Shimeng produced a string of late saves to deny Spain victory, but a point was enough for both sides to progress. That\u2019s about all from me, but we will have match reports from both games online shortly. Thanks for joining me, and please join my esteemed colleague, John Brewin, for tonight\u2019s late games: So, Germany\u2019s next game will be in Grenoble on Saturday. They will play one of the third-placed sides \u2013 most likely from Group A, which will probably be Nigeria. Spain will play Group F\u2019s winners (probably USA) in Reims on Monday, and China are likely to face the Group C winners, who will probably be Italy, in Montpellier next Tuesday. Hope that\u2019s cleared things up for you. The World Cup action doesn\u2019t end here \u2013 join John Brewin for live coverage of the Group A finale, with hosts France facing Nigeria, and Norway v South Korea. Here\u2019s how Group B finished. Just to clarify \u2013 China are definitely through, as they are guaranteed to finish among the top four third-placed sides. Spain run out of time, but they are into the World Cup knockout stages for the first time ever. The bad news is they\u2019ll probably face the USA in the last 16. China are also through, largely thanks to goalkeeper Peng Shimeng. It\u2019s farewell to South Africa, and three wins from three for Germany, who win Group B. Dabritz, Popp, Leupolz and Magull got the goals. Time\u2019s almost up in Montpellier. Germany are winning handsomely, but a quick word for South Africa. They\u2019ve had their moments here, gave Spain a scare and went toe-to-toe with China. This is their first World Cup, and many of their players don\u2019t have professional contracts. They have plenty to be proud of. My speech is almost spoiled by a late German break, but Dlamani makes a fine save with her legs. Peng clatters into the post, and is hurt. She needs treatment on her knee. China don\u2019t have any subs left \u2013 but she looks OK to see out stoppage time, of which there will be four minutes. Late change for Spain: Seattle Reign\u2019s Celia Jimenez replaces Lucia Garcia. China bring on Yao Wei for Gu Yasha, who has had limited chances to show what she can do in attack. Can China hang on here? They look exhausted, and Peng has to rescue them again, turning Hermoso\u2019s header over the bar. In Montpellier, Mulaudzi breaks the German offside trap, but can\u2019t get her shot on target. Peng keeps China level! This is a brilliant save. Patri Guijarro, some 20 yards out, fires a shot towards the bottom corner \u2013 but the keeper gets down low to turn it around the post! Another goal chalked off for Germany! Giulia Gwinn gets forward from right-back and slots home, but the flag is up. South Africa operating a decent high line, even at 4-0 down. Putellas gets a header on target, but it\u2019s easy enough for Peng. \u201cSpain v China \u2013 the battle to avoid USA by not winning,\u201d notes Tony Reekie. \u201cSpain appear resigned to actually going forward while China are employing Scotland\u2019s first-half tactics throughout.\u201d Agreed; China are working hard for the point they need, but have shown no ambition at all. If they get an \u201ceasier\u201d draw while knackered and short of goals, will it have been worth it? Hermoso sends a header wide after Falcon cuts back inside and crosses from the left with her right. A nice moment in the other game \u2013 Germany see a goal ruled out for offside, with Van Wyk racing back and looking puffed. When the flag goes up, the defender jokingly berates the referee for making her run all the way back. What a chance for South Africa! Kgatlana gets a yard on her marker, which is frankly more than she needs. She speeds through on goal, but Schult stands tall and pushes her shot away! Almost a fifth for Germany! South Africa have been edging upfield and Germany strike on the break, substitute Schuller squaring for Sara Dabritz \u2013 who is denied by Dlamini! Spain keep pushing for the winner, with Putellas the latest to test Peng with a free-kick that\u2019s well struck, but lacks power. South Africa go close! Captain and centre-back Janine van Wyk decides to have a go from 30 yards out. Hey, why not? And it\u2019s a fine effort, staying low and zipping a foot over Schult\u2019s bar! China break upfield, Gu Yasha delivering an early cross towards Yang, who can\u2019t bring it under control under pressure. Change for Spain: Nahikari Garcia is replaced by Alexia Putellas of Barcelona. They have 25 minutes or so to secure what would be their second-ever World Cup win. Shot count: Spain 14, China 1. Right-back Marta Corradera is the latest to have a go, if a rather optimistic one from some 30 yards out. China living dangerously here \u2013 one goal for Spain would leave them nervously hoping to sneak through with three points. Lucia Garcia almost breaks the deadlock here, but her low shot is turned away by Peng! Lina Magull gets on the scoresheet after Dlamini tips Hegering\u2019s header onto the post. That\u2019s harsh on the goalkeeper, although admittedly a fair reflection of the game so far. Another change for China, with Wang Shuang replaced by Li Wen. As China try to reorganise, Garcia has a half-chance from a free kick \u2013 but a red shirt is there to block once again. Fine save from Dlamini! The goalkeeper atones for her earlier error, getting a hand to turn Leubolz\u2019s close-range header over the bar! Ramalepe goes into the book, after another agricultural challenge, this time on Huth. Magull is booked, apparently for dissent, then takes the free kick. It\u2019s cleared for a corner... Chance for Spain! Guijarro turns sharply in the area, and sees her snap-shot deflected behind for a corner \u2013 from which the midfielder gets a header on goal that Peng collects underneath her crossbar. Ramalepe is lucky not to concede a penalty, scything Popp down in the penalty area. The full-back then brings down Magull outside the area, conceding a free kick. Magull is taking a while to get up. Half-time changes in both games: For China, Yang Li comes on for Wang Shanshan. For Spain, Mariona Caldentey is replaced by Andrea Sanchez Falcon. South Africa have brought on Thembi Kgatlana and Rhoda Mulaudzi, while Carolin Simon replaces Schweers at left-back for Germany. Back under way in both games. Half-time listening: China create their best chance just beyond the break, with Li just unable to connect with Wang\u2019s cross to the far post. But it\u2019s 0-0 at half-time. Germany have located their scoring boots, putting three past South Africa in the first half. Drifting towards half-time in Le Havre, although Spain have a free kick in the China half. It\u2019s hoiked into the area in rather un-Spanish fashion, but Peng comes off her line and does enough to clear away. It\u2019s three in Montpellier, and Alexandra Popp has her first goal of this World Cup! She\u2019s missed a couple of chances, but made no mistake here, powering a header home from Gwinn\u2019s cross. Hermoso denied by Peng! Li Ying gets forward down the right flank, but her cross is easy for Pa\u00f1os. Spain get back on the front foot and Hermoso gets a header on target, but Peng makes a fine stop, and gathers at the second attempt. Almost a third for Germany! Buhl\u2019s low cross finds Huth, who can\u2019t get a touch to turn it in! Moments later, a crafty dummy plays Magull in \u2013 but the midfielder skews her shot over the bar! It looks a case of how many for Germany. An injury break in Le Havre, with Wang Shanshan taking a boot to the knee. Yang Li warms up, but Wang is able to continue for now. Popp had the chance to play Dabritz in, but completely overhit the cross, and turned away in disgust \u2013 only for Dlamini to parry the ball across goal rather than hold it. Dabritz got there first, and tucked it away. Ah, that\u2019s a shame. South Africa had held steady since that first goal, but a goalkeeping error allows Germany to double their lead. Spain continue to threaten, but from Ouahabi\u2019s cross, Hermoso is closed down by roughly half the Chinese team. They look happy to settle for a point already. Halfway through the first halves, and still goalless in Le Havre. Spain win a free kick and it\u2019s lifted into the area, but Victoria Torrecilla\u2019s hopeful header drifts wide. Spain have had 70% possession, with China happy to sit back and try to break. Jenni Hermoso gets frustrated and concedes a free kick with a heavy challenge. Spain\u2019s next attack ends with Caldentey hitting an undercooked pass. It works better if you say it out loud, alright? What a miss! Vilakazi has an effort from distance for South Africa, but Germany go straight back upfield and Dabritz gets in on goal. Her shot is well saved but the rebound lands at the feet of Popp. She can\u2019t sort her feet out, and blazes over! It felt like a matter of time, and Germany get on the scoresheet from a corner. Melanie Leupolz is given the freedom of the penalty area, and heads home tidily. In Montpellier, it\u2019s one-way traffic. South Africa keeping Germany at bay so far, but they\u2019ve barely left their half. Another chance for Spain! China get forward and send a couple of testing crosses in, before Spain do the same \u2013 Hermoso squaring for Lucia Garcia, who gets there ahead of Peng but prods the ball wide! That\u2019s two missed chances for the Athletic Bilbao forward. Chance for Spain! A lovely slide-rule pass sets Lucia Garcia up one-on-one with Peng Shimeng. The Chinese keeper races a mile off her line, and Garcia gets round her \u2013 but the angle is tight, and she delays the shot, allowing a defender to get back. Germany earn a free kick on the edge of the box, which Magull whips into a dangerous area. Popp connects with it but her shot is tame, and Dlamini gathers. South Africa v Germany is go! As is China v Spain, just under a minute behind. In Montpellier, the teams are out for the anthems. In Le Havre, China and Spain are on their way out of the tunnel. Five minutes to go!

Welcome to the World Cup\u2019s second act \u2013 a frantic bottleneck of 12 fixtures in four days, breaking the reassuring rhythm of the early group games and drawing up each team\u2019s road map to the final. In Group B at least, things appear straightforward. Germany are through, and will secure top spot unless South Africa pull off a monumental upset (25-1, since you ask). That\u2019s also the only way the debutants can claw their way off the bottom of the group. It\u2019s not going to happen. That leaves China and Spain shooting it out in Le Havre, where the winners will secure second place. A draw would send both sides through \u2013 Spain in second, China guaranteed to be one the best third-placed sides. Should either side lose, they face four days of uncertainty. The twist is that in this group, it might be better to avoid second place. The runners-up will face the Group F winners (probably the USA) in the last 16, while the third-placed team\u2019s most likely opponents will be Italy. Spain, despite their obvious potential, have never reached the World Cup knockouts. China have gone to at least the quarter-finals every time in all six of their appearances. Whoever lies in wait, both will be desperate to make it through. Kick-offs: 5pm BST."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
