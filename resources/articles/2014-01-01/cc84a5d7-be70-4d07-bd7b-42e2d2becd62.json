The act lays down what the federation can do \u2013 represent views on police welfare and efficiency; and what it cannot \u2013 strike. Now, 95 years later, an independent report, commissioned by the federation, recommends \"change from top to bottom in culture, behaviours, structures and organisation\". Though the report is not the federation's own work, it must have been aware what a group of experts chaired by a former Home Office permanent secretary might be likely to come up with. The panel's findings are duly devastating. Rarely can an organisation have commissioned such an unflattering portrait of itself. This is proof either of the federation's ineptitude or of its readiness to change. Yet it seems surprising that the independent panel start by saying that the basic 1919 settlement remains intact. If so much else is in need of change, it is surely possible that the governing framework is itself partly to blame. What is not in doubt is that the federation is not doing the job of representation well enough. At a time of radical but piecemeal changes \u2013 among them large cuts in staffing, the introduction of police and crime commissioners and the reshaping of pay and conditions \u2013 the federation has had little effective impact. Too often it either opposes change outright or takes unachievable policy stances, so that rank-and-file interests are poorly represented and defended. The upshot is that chief constables and commissioners get too little buy-in from the federation, the membership feels unappreciated and alienated, and internal relations often descend to personal mistrust and hostility. The Andrew Mitchell shambles, on one level so trivial but on another profoundly revealing, can be understood only against this dysfunctional background. It might be possible for federation activists to dismiss Sir David Normington's report as a leadership own goal, were it not for one fact: a specially commissioned poll finds 91% of federation members want change too. But is this the change they want? The panel's proposals might make the federation a more effective stakeholder. But only an optimist can imagine that current levels of alienation will simply be swept away by another top-down reform. Much needs changing in policing, including the representative structures and culture. Yet police reform is suffering from the piecemeal nature of the current change process. A more holistic, royal commission-style approach in which everyone, the federation included, could sign up to a package deal would stand a better chance of producing the stabilised modern policing that this country badly needs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
