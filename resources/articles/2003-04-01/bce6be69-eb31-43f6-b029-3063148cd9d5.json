The organisations are to write to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the FA claiming that the appointment could jeopardise the foundation's work at the lower levels of the game and its impartiality, and that Richards' appointment high lights the Premier League's control over other football organisations. The foundation has an annual budget of \u00a360m. A source said: \"We are worried that this money might be diverted from grassroots work to areas that benefit Premiership clubs. We should have a completely independent chairman of the Football Foundation, not somebody who represents the interests of the Premier League.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
