Top stories The brother of the Australian racing legend Winx is one of thousands of exported thoroughbreds killed for meat in Korea under conditions the RSPCA has called \u201cvery distressing\u201d, a Guardian Australia investigation has found. Footage filmed secretly at the Nonghyup abattoir in South Korea last year shows horses being repeatedly beaten on the head with lengths of black polyethylene pipe in an attempt to herd them into the facility. That treatment would be in breach both of Australian animal welfare laws and of the requirements imposed on abattoirs that process live export animals if it was part of a formal Australian supply chain, the RSPCA said. In the past five years Australia has exported 158 racehorses to South Korea. But the Australian government says responsibility for the horses is out of its hands. After two police raids on media outlets in two days, the Greens and Centre Alliance have accused the government of a double standard.The Greens senator Nick McKim accused the government of \u201cleaking sensitive information like a sieve when it suits them\u201d while Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick said it was \u201cabhorrent\u201d that public interest reports applying scrutiny to officials\u2019 actions were now being investigated. Over the last three years referrals to the police resulted in raids investigating leaks about the national broadband network and Peter Dutton\u2019s ministerial intervention in the case of two foreign au pairs. NSW Labor will stop accepting political donations from the fossil fuel industry and ban them altogether when it wins government, one of the candidates for the NSW Labor leadership, Chris Minns, has announced. In a pitch designed to burnish his credentials on the climate crisis, Minns is today sending emails to branch members explaining his policy. \u201cWe can\u2019t just put it in the too-hard basket,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe time to take climate change action is running out.\u201d NSW already has bans on political donations from property developers, tobacco, liquor and gambling industries. World Donald Trump has started his visit to Ireland by comparing its post-Brexit border with Northern Ireland to the US border with Mexico, along which he wants to build a permanent wall. \u201cI think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border,\u201d he said at a joint press conference. A visibly uncomfortable taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall, a keystone of Irish government policy. A severely ill Dutch girl widely reported by international media as having been \u201clegally euthanised\u201d in a clinic in the Netherlands died at home, apparently after voluntarily refusing to eat or drink and with no evidence that her death was assisted. Paramilitaries in Khartoum threw dozens of bodies into the Nile to try to hide the number of casualties inflicted during a dawn attack on pro-democracy protesters in the Sudanese capital this week, doctors and activists have said. Voters looked set to return the third left-leaning government in a year to the Nordic region, after exit polls suggested Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats had secured victory in parliamentary elections with more than 25% of the vote. Ancient Siberia was home to previously unknown humans, scientists say, with DNA analysis revealing hardy groups genetically distinct from Eurasians and east Asians. Opinion and analysis A media freedom act that positively puts the role of the press in the middle of our legal system is the solution to the increasing criminalisation of the legitimate work of journalists, writes Peter Greste in response to two federal police raids on Australian media in two days: \u201cAt the moment, there is nothing in Australian law that explicitly protects press freedom in the way that the First Amendment does in the US constitution. Such an act would recognise the fundamental importance of national security and the protection of certain commonwealth activities and the identities of key employees, whilst still providing a basis for journalists to investigate and report on government misconduct.\u201d In the last year the economy had the slowest growth since 2009, and for the first time in 36 years GDP per capita has gone backwards in three consecutive quarters, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cThe big message from the GDP figures is that the biggest lie during the election campaign was not the death tax but that the LNP has managed a strong economy. In reality they have run it into the ground.\u201d Sport On the eve of the Women\u2019s World Cup, the Matildas captain, Sam Kerr, talks exclusively to Richard Parkin about her initial reluctance to embrace the game after growing up in an AFL-dominated environment in Perth, and the challenges of swapping a Sherrin for a round ball. Given her current status as one of the world\u2019s best footballers, it\u2019s perhaps surprising that, by her own admission, she was \u201ctotal crap\u201d in her first season. Queensland opened the 2019 State of Origin series with victory at Suncorp Stadium, in a win that will be remembered as much for a multitude of missed opportunities as for their ability to overcome a talent deficit with energy, cohesion and will. Thinking time: The rise of body-positive swimwear From larger-cup bikinis to modest beachwear, fashion is finally beginning to cater for a range of women\u2019s bodies after decades of limiting choices to itsy bitsy bikinis in one size fits all. \u201cI buy swimwear about once every 10 years,\u201d says Sasha Khan, a London charity worker who wears a size 10/12 and has a 32FF bust. \u201cI always put it off. I hate it. It\u2019s like having to go to the dentist or get your eyes tested.\u201d Stephanie Boland, 28, agrees. \u201cIt fits into the narrative, which I think a lot of us have internalised, that your body is wrong for the clothes, rather than the clothes being wrong for your body \u2026 it\u2019s depressing to buy things that are supposedly in your size and find they don\u2019t fit at all.\u201d Now though, in part thanks to the rise of online shopping, retailers are beginning to sharpen up. \u201cIf we think about online providers, in effect they have endless aisles, which means that they can store unlimited inventory,\u201d explains Jonathan Reynolds, a retail expert at the University of Oxford. According to market researchers Mintel, 18% of women buy plus-size clothing. Online-only retailers have proved particularly adept in targeting these consumers. And, even for women who are not plus-sized, online shopping takes the sting out of buying swimwear. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is people purchasing multiple swimsuits online, trying them on in their own home and sending the remainder back,\u201d says Steven Wright, a senior lecturer in fashion design at the University of South Wales. Media roundup Experts are divided on whether the \u201csophisticated operator\u201d behind the data breach at the Australian National University can be attributed to China, the Canberra Times reports. \u201cWar on truth\u201d is the headline on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, with a report saying the Scott Morrison government is attempting to distance itself from raids by the AFP on media organisations. And dingos\u2019 diets are widening during drought as food and water become increasingly scare, a report in the ABC says, with the predators hunting and eating larger animals such as cattle. Coming up Scott Morrison winds up his trip to the UK before heading for Singapore. Cardinal George Pell\u2019s appeal continues against his convictions for sexually abusing two boys in the 1990s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
