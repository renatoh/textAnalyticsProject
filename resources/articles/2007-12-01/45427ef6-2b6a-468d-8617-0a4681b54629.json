But for me that shows that he is a strong character and I'm certain he won't crack under the current pressure. \"Talk of Sam losing his job is insane, he is a top manager and deserves time; he's only been there a few months.\" Ian Hendon: made 97 appearances for Notts County between 1997 and 1999 \"The one thing about Sam is that he's honest, I'm sure he's given a few of those Newcastle players a rollicking. They'll know he's not happy with their performances. \"Sam has always prepared for matches with great focus, he did that at County whether we were at the top or bottom of the league. He'll be doing the same I'm sure for the Arsenal match, he won't let the current speculation affect his preparations.\" Simon Charlton: made 132 appearances for Bolton Wanderers between 2000 and 2004 \"Sam has matured as a manager and I remember from my time at Bolton that he lost his temper less and less as time went on. He's very focused and will not let the current scrutiny get to him. Sam knows what he's trying to achieve and will stick with that until it's done. \"As long as Sam is given time and has the support of the players, Newcastle will progress. He is a top manager, the best I have worked for in my career.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
