It is a strange, rich thing - a book of places rather than people, as if the ageing writer pictured his younger self not as the protagonist but as the narrator of a Dickens novel full of revealing set-pieces and pungent anecdotes. He is much exercised by the \"Hogarth side\" of London, and at one point recalls witnessing, through the square of a cab window as he and his father jogged across London bridge, \"a woman reeling backward as a man felled her to the ground with a blow in the face\". It is so Dickensian a memory that one almost wonders whether it really happened, or if it was a conflation of his own experience with his subsequent reading around it. Life, for the James children, must have been unbearably lonely as they were trotted around Europe by their culture-vulture father, ever the toff outsiders. The young Henry clearly found community through culture: he barely mentions his mother or most of his siblings, but is unsparing about the entertainments of the day. Take this verdict on the actor-manager Charles Kean: \"No actor so little graced by nature probably ever went so far towards repairing it by a kind of cold rage of endeavour.\" Mrs Kean's Lady Macbeth he recalls as \"a queer hooped and hook-nosed figure, of large circumference and archaic attire, strange tasteless toggery\". Film directors should be obliged to read this memoir as a condition of being allowed to plunder the oeuvre again - a quite different imagination is at work from the one usually known as Jamesian. Yet here, too, is the repression that was to form the familiar aesthetic - as Frances Wilson points out in her introduction: \"James must be the only writer who aimed to lose, rather than find, himself in autobiography.\" \u0095 Gibson Square Books: 020-7689 4790 or www.gibson-square.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
