The rioters attempted to pick fights with festival-goers in Federation Square on Saturday night, with police saying a gang based in Melbourne\u2019s southern suburbs, called Apex, was responsible for the riot. The Moomba festival is a family-friendly event that coincides with Victoria\u2019s Labour day long-weekend. The behaviour that began at about 8pm was \u201cabhorrent and violent,\u201d said Victoria police\u2019s chief commissioner, Graham Ashton, as people enjoying the festival were forced to run for cover in nearby buildings as gang members began to use chairs as weapons. One person was hospitalised. Ashton said police had been monitoring Apex as part of Taskforce Tense, with the group allegedly responsible for a number of aggravated burglaries, motor vehicle thefts and assaults over the past year. He said 33 arrests had been made in the past few months, with 20 gang members remanded in custody. Four additional people were arrested on Saturday night but Ashton said this number would \u201crise significantly\u201d in coming weeks. Members of the gang were as young as 12, he said. \u201cWe have good-quality CCTV footage and we\u2019ll be making further arrests this week of ringleaders and other people engaging in this unacceptable violence,\u201d he said. It was not the first time the group had been into the city looking to cause trouble, Ashton said, with the gang present during new year celebrations in the city and at the all-night White Night festival. But a heavy police presence in the city on Saturday night prompted the group to escalate their violence, the commissioner said. There were 11 separate incidents throughout the city, he said, including assaults and robberies, and a police officer was also hit with an object. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving to make sure those people are under arrest,\u201d Ashton said. A witness to the violence, Hon Weng Chong, told the ABC that he was getting ice cream with a friend at Federation Square when he saw violence erupt. \u201cThey would go up to the top of the stairs and somehow there was something that sparked a stampede,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just came running all the way down; it was really crazy there was like so many of them running towards us. \u201cAll in all it was a very chaotic scene.\u201d He captured footage of the group knocking down a fence. The lord mayor of Melbourne, Robert Doyle, told the Herald Sun: \u201cWhat happened to the days when there was great respect for the [Victoria police] uniform, rather than seeing it as a target to taunt? \u201cThere\u2019s something very strange going on there that I don\u2019t understand yet, but it\u2019s something we all need to address.\u201d On Monday morning, deputy police commissioner Andrew Crisp told radio 3AW that police were reviewing their procedures for securing major events after the incident. \u201cWe will be looking at how we police major events in the city somewhat different in the future,\u201d he said. Extra police have been brought in to the city for the remainder of the Moomba festival, he added. He also warned the about 100 youths involved in the riots that the CCTV footage police had obtained was extensive and of high quality. \u201cWe have clear footage of who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cGive yourself [up], go to your local police station, because we\u2019ll come knocking on your door.\u201d However, he said it was important to understand how youths became involved in gangs and to try to address those issues as well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
