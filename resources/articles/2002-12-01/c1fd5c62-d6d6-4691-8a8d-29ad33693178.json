When his lips move,\" is a joke dating at least from the Harold Wilson era - even before my impressionable youth. Politicians Tell Porkies Shocker! Whatever next! We in the media lie too. We make mistakes as well, whoppers sometimes, more than they do. Unlike them we are rarely held to proper account except in the libel courts, a rich man's option not open to most victims of tabloid rough justice: ordinary folk, local councillors, trade union officials, vicars' wives. But government lies matter more because they run the country and can only do so if a substantial proportion of voters - more than those who voted for the party that won the election - accept their basic competence and honesty. So trust is a precious commodity, getting scarcer by the day, across most industrial democracies. Representative government is under siege. But sophisticated cynicism is more corrosive to this crisis than bright-eyed naivety. If forced to choose I would prefer to be trusting rather than suspicious. Fortunately, I am not forced to choose. As one of the parliamentary lobby's Old Fartonians I can - and do - say to No10 spokesfolk: \"I'm sure you don't believe the rubbish you've just given us any more than we do.\" Occasionally they blush, albeit off the record. In any case you don't have to print what they say. In practice I do think things have got worse in recent years, although I should point out that the No10 spokesman during the Suez Crisis resigned in 1956 because Anthony Eden's inner cabal had lied to him about the Anglo-French collusion with Israel. Why is it worse than when I first heard soft-spoken Tom McCaffrey briefing for Jim Callaghan's No10 in the late 70s? A few years earlier under Wilson, No10 had suspended daily briefings until a truce was patched up. Tom was more emollient, though crafty in his own way. Bernard (\"bunkum and balderdash\") Ingham was anything but emollient. His well-known TV persona was also his briefer's persona. Sir Bernard has always denied telling lies to the lads during his tenure as No10's prison warder in Westminster's grubby gothic briefing room high above the Thames. I was working abroad during his and Lady Thatcher's greatest hour of trial, the Westland affair of 1986, so I will take his word for it. Around that time the Guardian, Independent, Scotsman and Economist were sufficiently bothered by his technique to withdraw from lobby briefings. We all returned in 1991 only after John Major agreed to end the ancient practice whereby briefings were never directly attributed to Downing St. Alastair Campbell has sometimes lied to me and often wilfully misled us all. As a highly partisan former tabloid man himself I think he understands truth in the same way that a libel lawyer does. It is what you can get away with. Broadsheet agonising is for wankers. His enemies at the Mail feel much the same and more than any other newspaper it feeds Labour's deep paranoia about the press, allowing the party to justify its own deceits. Neither side ever admits to being wrong, not in a specific way, though Campbell had the grace to realise his relationship with the media had become a failed marriage, better ended. His civil service successors in the briefer's chair, Godric Smith (the blusher) and Tom Kelly (do Ulstermen ever blush?), are obliged to be as straight as they can be. Besides they know less than Ali, and their scope is thus restricted. So \"no spin is the new spin\" has become this year's brittle joke. There is some truth in it, though it is hard to be a spokesman in such an adversarial climate. \"You lot are much harder on the spokesmen than we are in Berlin,\" a German reporter told me the other day after attending a briefing. All the same, Tom and Godric now brief both on the record and post their own version of the twice-daily joustings on the No10 website, where you can read it if you really want to. Since last month they actually allow any journalist, even Germans, to attend their morning session, now staged in the name of openness at the Foreign Press Association's HQ off Pall Mall. Many of us suspected this change was designed to cut the Westminster lobby pack down to size. As with EU summit press conferences, whenever the questioning gets tough the briefer can always break it up by taking a question from the Turk or Greek: they always ask about Greece or Turkey. But as I say, trust before suspicion is my watchword. Few non-lobby outsiders bother to turn up and we benefit from the half-mile walk to Pall Mall. It has not proved too painful a revolution. My hunch remains that the new transparency will not prove too much for the media, but for the government. This is a system designed for the fair weather of a second term, large majority government. A big storm will blow it away. Imagine if John Prescott had been due to brief live on camera (part of the new arrangement) during the worst morning of Cheriegate. I don't think so. The main reason why things have become worse, apart from New Labour's libel-lawyer view of truth, is the emergence of the relentless 24/7 news cycle. So different from the days of my youth when dear old Percy Clarke, the Labour party press officer, no spin doctor he, travelled around on a bike and told you what he knew (well, sometimes) without hyperbole. The news seemed to travel by bike too, no ISDN lines then, it was slow in ways hard to imagine now when a combination of technology (faxes, mobiles, the internet, search engines, cable TV) and rampant market competition has created so much pointless restlessness in the media. Spin became important for that reason, because the stakes became so high: hesitate to get your message across and to make sure everyone was on message and Sky, BBC News 24 and Radio Bogshire would have the other bloke's spin on air before you could say Mandelson. As a result the tone of public debate is so much more frantic, so much coarser, less reflective. In the longer perspective the past fortnight's troubles may not loom so large or apocalyptic as the Mail, Telegraph or (oddly) Mirror would have us believe. Both sides in this small trench war will quickly forget, though the voters whom we are all supposed to be serving (as well as Lord Rothermere) may be left a little more disaffected. That is the real loss, not whether or not pundits savage each other (or me) in print. If you hand it out, you've got to take it. In the case of the Guardian v the Mail it's deep and personal, rival visions of what Britain should be expounded by what are probably the two strongest newspaper brands on Fleet Street. So those of us who get shot at are merely caught in the crossfire. And besides they're usually only flesh wounds and we can fire back. It's the Godrics and Kellys who can't fire back that I feel sorry for. One of the team came up to me in Copenhagen to announce a briefing. \"We thought we'd do some team-building with the lobby,\" he said. \"Perhaps a group hug.\" Liar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
