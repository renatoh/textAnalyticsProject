With goal-shy hosts enter taining travel-sick visitors it was going to take something superhuman to decide a predictably dour affair. It was left to Sunderland's Claudio Reyna, not Captain America but the captain of America, to provide the defining moment of a game that will have been lost from the memory before that other character famed for wearing red and white sets out on his annual trek from Lapland tonight. Reyna, a New Yorker, answered Reid's call for greater midfield goal power by marking his home debut after the \u00a34.5m move from Glasgow Rangers with the winner 14 minutes from time, poking home a Jason McAteer cross from all of a foot out. He was honest enough to admit the strike made up for an earlier miss, when he blazed over from similarly close range in a contest bereft of clear openings, and revealed that Reid has given him instructions to take up advanced positions whenever possible. He said: \"The formation we play allows me to get forward more because we have cover. The manager said from day one that he wants me to try and push on as much as I can to create chances. Any midfielder will tell you they like to do that.\" \"It wasn't a classic,\" admitted the Sunderland manager who like many in another near sell-out crowd had resigned himself to witnessing what would have been the first stalemate between these old foes in more than three decades of Wearside meetings. As a spectacle it simply did not justify the sterling efforts of the groundstaff, who ensured the game went ahead after overnight blizzards demanded two pitch inspections. \"It was difficult out there with a swirling wind and I thought the players did well in the conditions,\" said Reid, who picked out Kevin Phillips as the game's finest player. \"I thought Kevin was outstanding and it just shows that a striker doesn't have to score to have a good game. He showed great body strength and his link-up play for us was excellent.\" If Sunderland's record of 14 goals in 18 Premiership outings this term remains uninspiring, Everton, who have lost 10 of their last 15 away games, were equally inept when venturing near Thomas Sorensen's goal. \"It was disappointing to lose because we contained them for most of the game and it was a scrappy goal to concede,\" said Walter Smith, who substituted Thomas Gravesen early on after the midfielder escaped with a booking for two wild lunges at Julio Arca. The biggest threat to Sunderland's third clean sheet in four outings arrived via the patella of one of their own, Bernt Haas, who deflected Scot Gemmill's cross alarmingly close to his own net shortly after half-time. Man of the match: Kevin Phillips (Sunderland)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
