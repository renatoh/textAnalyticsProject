We may not want soviet-style planning, but a nationally agreed framework is the best way of ensuring all new homes are zero-carbon by 2016. Staged national delivery of improved levels of the code for sustainable homes will ensure pioneering technologies are robust, meet customer expectations and are backed by proper warranties. This phased increase in energy efficiency will also ensure the extra 240,000 homes a year to meet demand are not jeopardised. A multitude of differing targets around the country put these efforts at risk. In their dash to reach short-term targets, local authorities should not put the objective of more and greener homes at risk. Stewart Baseley Chairman, Home Builders Federation I was saddened, but not surprised, to learn that the volume housebuilders are trying to block any councils from requiring that at least 10% of electricity for new developments must be generated via renewable sources. Earlier this year I promoted a private members bill to allow councils to include in their local development plans reasonable requirements for higher energy efficiency standards and to promote microgeneration and the generation of renewable and low-carbon energy. The bill was supported by both opposition frontbenches and 280 backbench MPs from all parties. But the then local government minister Phil Woolas intervened to delay its progress irreparably. One of the main reasons he gave was that permitting any such higher standards might deter speculative builders' \"development viability\". Every single time any government over the past 25 years has sought to increase minimum energy standards under building regulations, these have been delayed and watered down by the volume housebuilders' lobby. I am glad it is now committed to building only zero-carbon homes from 2016. But in the intervening decade, approaching 2 million new homes are due to be constructed at less than optimum ecological standards. I really do expect my colleagues in government - especially Phil Woolas in his new role as environment minister - not to be deterred by specious commercial special pleading from permitting at least some of these new homes to become more energy friendly. Martin Caton MP Lab, Gower As someone who works daily with local authorities, developers and businesses, I can tell you that Merton-type rules are having a huge impact on the deployment of renewables and are causing a sea-change in awareness. The government should let local authorities continue to push for action on renewables, despite its own reluctance to act.
