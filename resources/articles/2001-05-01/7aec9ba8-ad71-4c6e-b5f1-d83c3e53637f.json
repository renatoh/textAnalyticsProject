Bob Dylan turns sixty in 2001. Buy Down the Highway at Amazon.co.uk 1. Bound for Glory by Woody Guthrie In his wonderful 1943 autobiography, which reads like a picaresque novel, Guthrie shows he was a gifted prose writer as well as a genius songwriter. The young Bob Dylan was enthralled. 2. The Real Frank Zappa Book by Frank Zappa with Peter Occhiogrosso The late great Frank Zappa expounds on music, and life in general, in characteristically iconoclastic style. Wise and laugh-out-loud funny. 3. Songwriters on Songwriting by Paul Zollo Leading songwriters talk to Paul Zollo, editor of SongTalk, about their craft. The impressive list of interviewees ranges from Pete Seeger to Madonna to Sammy Cahn and Bob Dylan. Fascinating. 4. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley by Peter Guralnick Truly definitive. Even the taciturn Bob Dylan was moved to praise: \"[Elvis] steps from these pages, you can feel him breathe?\" 5. Woody Guthrie: A Life by Joe Klein Despite its strengths, Guthrie's autobiography took licence with the facts. Klein offers an exemplary straight biography: authoritative, non-judgmental, and not a word wasted. 6. Dino: Living High in The Dirty Business of Dreams by Nick Tosches Best remembered as a drunk, the singer Dean Martin is not an obvious subject for a 572-page appreciation. In his elegant biography, however, Tosches persuades the reader they understand Martin and the fast times in which he lived. 7. Invisible Republic: Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes by Greil Marcus An exploration of Dylan's recording sessions with The Band following his 1966 motorcycle accident, sessions that resulted in The Basement Tapes album. Importantly, Marcus also draws the reader into the background story of American roots music. 8. Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now by Barry Miles The inside story of the greatest pop band of them all. 9. The Mansion on the Hill by Fred Goodman An impeccably researched history of the business of popular music, reminding one, if reminder were needed, that record companies are principally interested in the manufacture, distribution and sale of plastic. The music recorded therein comes second. 10. Why Me? The Autobiography of Sammy Davis Jr. by Sammy Davis Jr. with Jane and Burt Boyar An entertainer of great talent, but little discernible taste, recalls fortunes earned and wasted during a life in show business. Most amusing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
