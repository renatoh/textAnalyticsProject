While Forest increased their unbeaten run to 14 matches with their 3-0 win against Preston, Wednesday suffered their eighth defeat in 10 matches in crashing 2-0 at home to Swansea. Wednesday, who have taken only two points during their winless sequence, have now gone six matches without even scoring. They were always struggling to do so yesterday, when they were sunk by two Darren Pratley goals. The other clubs who made managerial changes last week \u2013 QPR and Reading \u2013 had 1-1 draws against Sheffield United and Bristol City respectively. Reading came from behind for their point, with the substitute Simon Church getting their equaliser from a cross by another sub, Jimmy Klebe, in stoppage time. Church's elation was short-lived, though, as his goal celebration among Reading's fans led to a second booking and a red card. Peterborough achieved their first victory in six matches under their new manager, Mark Cooper, in overcoming Watford 2-1. They clinched it through a first Football League goal by Exodus Geohaghon, the defender whom Cooper signed on loan from his previous club Kettering. Still, Watford, in addition to avoiding administration on Friday, could also console themselves with the thought they created plenty of chances and deserved to get more from the game. Crystal Palace's midfielder, Darren Ambrose, a scoring revelation since his free-transfer move from Charlton, missed an early penalty against Barnsley. However, after Barnsley had capitalised on it by taking the lead, Palace's 19-year-old Victor Moses again showed why he is likely to be among the most sought-after players in the January transfer window by scoring a superb equaliser with an overhead kick from the edge of the penalty area. The day's most entertaining match was in League One, where Charlton were held to a 4-4 draw by Millwall. The visitors' Steve Morison scored a hat-trick \u2013 his first away goals for the club \u2013 but will not be boasting about it because his third goal was at the wrong end and put Charlton 4-3 ahead. After Morison had given Millwall a 2-0 lead, Deon Burton brought Charlton level again with two penalties \u2013 the second following a professional foul by Nadjim Abdou that brought Abdou a red card. Millwall, who then hauled themselves back from 3-2 behind to 3-3, went on to make up for the blow that Morison unwittingly dealt them thanks to Danny Schofield's goal in the last minute. In the only League Two match to survive the weather, Rochdale increased their lead at the top to seven points with their 4-0 win over Shrewsbury. But whether this is going to stop their manager, Keith Hill, worrying about again losing a star player in the January transfer window because of the club's difficult financial situation, is another matter. One Rochdale youngster attracting interest from bigger clubs is the 19-year-old defender Craig Dawson, who was signed from Radcliffe Borough last season. He scored twice against Shrewsbury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
