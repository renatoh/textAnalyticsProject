The televised appeal, issued as a 10-day deadline imposed by their captors nears, told the men that they were never out of their families' thoughts. It also appeared to contain a message aimed directly at the hostage-takers. \"We know that you have the power to return them to us and we ask you to do so,\" Carey said. \"We remain serious and committed to exploring all the options open to us to bring about their safe return.\" The five men - an IT consultant and his bodyguards - were abducted from the Iraqi finance ministry headquarters in Baghdad on May 29 by about 40 heavily armed men from a group calling itself the Islamic Shi'ite Resistance in Iraq. In a video passed to an Arabic television station last week, the group said it would kill one of the hostages unless all British troops withdraw from the country within 10 days. The video was broadcast first nine days ago, leading to speculation that the deadline may expire tomorrow. Despite the demand for British withdrawal, it is thought the real aim of the group is the release of its leader, Qais al-Khazaali, who is in US custody. Through the former archbishop, the families said: \"We have been apart from you, our husbands, sons, brothers and fathers for over six months now and we hope and pray that you will be back home with us soon. \"It has been a difficult time for us all being apart from you, particularly at this time of the year. \"We appeal to those holding you: please allow our loved ones to hear this message and let them know how much we love them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
