Perhaps it would have been noted more widely had Guardiola not always seemed like the reasonable one when he was in charge at Barcelona and there was so much needle between him and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, then at Real Madrid, the two men seemed filled with revulsion that they occasionally had to share one another\u2019s oxygen. Guardiola always represented a style. He did it for the most part with great dignity and the Premier League will be a better place with him. \u201cI forget for whom the description \u2018women want to be with him, men want to be him\u2019 was first coined,\u201d Graham Hunter wrote in Bar\u00e7a, the Making of the Greatest Team in the World, \u201cbut it fits Guardiola as perfectly as those 30in-waist trousers which still, improbably, fit his snake hips.\u201d It is a shame, however, that Guardiola appears to have abandoned the managerial etiquette that would usually be expected of him or stopped to think, as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger recently suggested, that someone in his position should understand the consequences of announcing mid-season that he is to leave Bayern Munich for a new challenge in the Premier League. Guardiola might not have mentioned Manchester City by name but his subsequent declaration that there had already been \u201cseveral offers\u201d was, in effect, confirmation that the club built on Abu Dhabi\u2019s riches were actively trying to lever him in at Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s expense. Unless, that is, you want to believe it was Swansea City, who have been trying to persuade Guardiola to repel Chelsea\u2019s advances and ignore whatever is going on with Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. No, it is pretty obvious what is going on and it has certainly put Pellegrini in an awkward position now it is absolutely clear the club\u2019s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, and director of football, Txiki Begiristain, are preparing to ease him out the door. Every one of Pellegrini\u2019s press conferences now has a Guardiola theme. Every flaw will be used as another piece of evidence why Abu Dhabi want an upgrade. The volume will only go up over the coming months and it wouldn\u2019t be the strangest thing if there was a shift, even subconsciously, in how the players view the current manager. Sir Alex Ferguson, reflecting on the 2001-02 season, when he eventually aborted plans to retire, can testify from first\u2011hand experience that a manager\u2019s voice is not so effective when the players suspect he is not going to be there much longer. What goes around comes around, you might think, given the way Pellegrini was recruited in the first place and how the news broke on the morning of the 2013 FA Cup final, contributing to a 1-0 defeat against Wigan Athletic and the most traumatic day City have experienced since the Abu Dhabi takeover (featuring chants from the losers\u2019 end of \u201cYou can stick your Pellegrini up your arse\u201d). Roberto Mancini later accused City of speaking to at least three managers while he was in charge, perhaps conveniently forgetting he was tapped up for Mark Hughes\u2019s job several months in advance. On and on it goes. It is a cut-throat industry and City have a long history of awkward handovers if you remember that when Frank Clark was sacked \u2013 \u201cThe Job from Hell,\u201d he calls the relevant chapter in his autobiography \u2013 he heard about it via the breakfast news on Radio GMR. Joe Royle, who had accepted the job the previous night, ended up taking City to court when he was asked to clear out his belongings a few years later. There were people in that old regime, he once told me, with \u201cmore faces than Tutankhamun\u201d. That goes back to the era of \u201cCityitis\u201d, losing to York City, an Auto Windscreens Shield tie against Mansfield Town and one infamous AGM at Bridgewater Hall being interrupted by a supporter allowing all the pent-up frustration to get the better of him and telling the panel of directors he was sick of \u201c20 years of shit\u201d. It\u2019s very different now, of course. There is an expertise at City and scale of ambition that Guardiola must find attractive. Their training ground is the best in England and the size of a village. The stadium has been enlarged and, at every level, there is the sense they know exactly what they are doing. It is a brilliantly slick operation and if City want to be thought of as the best club around it makes perfect sense to go for the best manager. Equally, at the risk of sounding overly cynical, it does feel like the lines are possibly starting to blur when City are now being strongly linked to Leroy San\u00e9, of Schalke, and this is a player Guardiola has already acclaimed as the rising star of German football. \u201cSan\u00e9 is a huge talent and I can only congratulate Germany to have a talent like him,\u201d Guardiola said in November. A coincidence? Or are things so far down the line that City are now putting in place deals for players to suit their manager-in-waiting? Pellegrini will bank a decent payoff, inevitably, and one imagines he might be a good fit ultimately for the Chile national job at some point, with doubts currently surrounding Jorge Sampaoli\u2019s position. Equally, would it be outlandish to suggest that he might be a reasonable candidate for Chelsea if Roman Abramovich cannot ambush the Guardiola deal? Diego Simeone\u2019s work at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid makes him an outstanding alternative but Pellegrini, despite his deliberately low profile, promotes the attacking football that Abramovich craves and has the advantage of speaking English. For now, all that can really be said for certain is that Guardiola has consistently shown the most beautiful way to win football matches and it is true that City, often doing the bare minimum, look like a team in need of a change in direction. Thierry Henry was asked recently to explain how it worked under Guardiola and recalled how his former manager had a system at the Camp Nou based around the \u201cthree Ps\u201d \u2013 play, possession and position. \u201cThe most important one was position,\u201d Henry explained. \u201cYou have to stay in your position, trust your team-mates and allow the ball to come to you.\u201d Guardiola wanted wide players who would not succumb to insecurity if the ball was not coming their way. He even put down cones on the training field so it was drilled into them to stay wide, stretch the play and not cross over. It was the final part of the pitch, close to the penalty area, when they were given the freedom to explode into life and drive infield. \u201cMy job is to take you up to the last third,\u201d Guardiola would tell them. \u201cYour job is to finish it.\u201d As for what happens when a player goes against the Guardiola credo, Henry found out one night in the Champions League. \u201cMe being me, I went there [to the right wing] to play with Leo [Messi]. I didn\u2019t really care, you know. I scored a goal, 1-0 up against Sporting Lisbon, all nice and everything. I could hear him [Guardiola] being upset. And, at half-time, he took me off. I was like: \u2018What did I do wrong?\u2019 Very similar to Van Gaal, when Pep had a plan \u2013 respect his plan.\u201d Guardiola is, in short, football royalty. His players were so in thrall of him at Barcelona they lined the front rows of the press conference when he announced he was leaving. Guardiola, as Jorge Valdano one said, believes in football where \u201cgreatness is possible \u2026 He never cheats, he is always brave, he takes away all the miseries of the game.\u201d Nobody could argue City would be better off as they are and Pellegrini, at 62, is streetwise enough to know what is going on. It is just a pity, perhaps, Guardiola has not shown him a little more consideration and it probably says a lot for the current manager that he has not, and will not, make a fuss. Players have eyes on TV deal too It didn\u2019t really come as a huge surprise to discover Marko Arnautovic had turned down Stoke City\u2019s opening contract offer, incorporating a pay rise to reflect his position as the club\u2019s leading scorer this season. Stoke\u2019s pay ceiling is \u00a370,000 a week. Arnautovic wants more \u2013 in excess of \u00a3100,000 \u2013 and while that may seem way over the top for a club of Stoke\u2019s size it is merely a reflection of how the Premier League\u2019s new television deal is threatening to shape the sport at that level. The impact of a \u00a35.136bn package means the mid-sized clubs will be so wealthy they can resist bids for their better players. Yet the players and agents know that, too, and will want to be paid more than ever when there will be so much money swilling around from next season. Leicester City may discover something similar when it comes to increasing Jamie Vardy\u2019s \u00a340,000-a-week salary, although they do have an advantage over Stoke bearing in mind he is contracted until 2018. Arnautovic\u2019s deal expires at the end of next season and he is approaching the stage where his transfer value starts to depreciate. Financially, he couldn\u2019t have timed it much better. Ferrell helps LAFC reach mediocrity Until now, Will Ferrell\u2019s involvement in football has mostly been limited to an appearance in the Soccer Aid match at Old Trafford in 2012, sharing a pitch with the likes of Gordon Ramsay, John Bishop and Robbie Williams. \u201cA lot of jerky people,\u201d Ferrell summarised, ahead of a match most notable for the tall bloke from Kasabian chipping David Seaman. It was a surprise therefore to hear that the star of the Mediocre American Man Trilogy, featuring the Anchorman films and Talladega Nights, is now one of the co-owners of Los Angeles FC, wannabe entrants into MLS for the 2018 season. Indeed, Ferrell seemed pretty surprised himself. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a part-owner of anything,\u201d he said, before correcting himself. \u201cActually, I\u2019m still part\u2011owner of an \u201884 Toyota Camry with my brother.\u201d In total, LA now have 26 co-owners, including Magic Johnson, Mia Hamm, the author Tony Robbins, various figures from the baseball world and not forgetting Vincent Tan, Cardiff City\u2019s owner, and Ruben Gnanalingam, joint chairman of QPR, two clubs rightly held up as role models for the way they handle themselves. LA might not have any players yet, or a stadium, but board meetings should be a lot of fun. \u201cI immediately regret this decision,\u201d as Ron Burgundy once said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
