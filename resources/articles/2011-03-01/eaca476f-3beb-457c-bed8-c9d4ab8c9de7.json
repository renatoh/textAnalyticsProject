Now, those roles have been reversed. If you love Elbow, but don't love Doves, this stirring, string-soaked heart-wrencher should win you over. Chris Salmon Paper Aeroplanes My First Love Intimate, jaunty and confident low-key pop with a great melody line, from the Welsh duo Sarah Howells and Richard Llewellyn. It's on their new mini-album We Are Ghosts. Robin Denselow Keren Ann Run With You Dreaminess is Keren Ann's stock in trade, and here, on a track from her new album, 101, the Paris-based songwriter (right) excels herself. A drifting guitar line, a hint of angelic choir and a murmured vocal from Keren Ann \u2013 think Feist, but with the Mediterranean sun in her sound. Caroline Sullivan Cashier No 9 Goldstar This Belfast folktronica band's blissful pop song introduces an intriguing character who wanders from disapproval to beating. \"I feel their eyeballs gawking/ I look better with my high heels on\", sings Danny Todd, perhaps referring to a working girl or a crossdresser. Either way, this is a brilliant single. Dave Simpson Young Dro Rubberband Banks The Atlanta rapper's latest mixtape, Equestrian Dro, is well worth hearing, but it's this 2006 classic I've been going back to: \"Outer space balling, put you up on astronomy/ Mathematically with a pistol I do trigonometry.\" Alex Macpherson Marius Neset Golden XPlosion Getting on to Django Bates's favourite-sax list isn't easy (it spans Charlie Parker to Evan Parker, with Iain Ballamy in the middle), but his star pupil at the Copenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory, 25-year-old Norwegian saxophonist Marius Neset, is there already. Neset's imminent second album is a showcase for his virtuosity and genre-crunching openness. John Fordham Widowspeak Harsh Realm Simmering shoegaze number from NYC trio Widowspeak fronted by Molly Hamilton, who does a pleasing turn of Hope Sandoval-inspired vocals. This b-side number, taken from their upcoming Captured Tracks 7in single, slips neatly into gloomy, light reverb blues and manages to outshine the swooning mid-tempo pop of flipside track Burn Out.
