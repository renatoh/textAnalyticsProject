The service will go back to level 4 alert status at midnight on Wednesday to coincide with the start of the second lockdown. The switch to level 4 means the NHS\u2019s response to the resurgence of the pandemic is being handled nationally rather than regionally and that NHS England\u2019s national incident coordination centre \u2013 comprising the organisation\u2019s senior team \u2013 has become operational again, having been stood down in July. It will monitor which hospitals are coming under the most pressure and decide what steps need to be taken to respond, for example by diverting patients with spare capacity and managing non-Covid care. The number of people seriously ill with Covid who are being treated in hospitals in England has risen from 2,000 at the end of September to almost 11,000. That is more than half of the 19,000 Covid patients whom hospitals were treating at the peak of the pandemic in April, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, said on Wednesday. Powis said the number of people being infected with coronavirus was rising across the country. The influx is not confined to places in the north such as Liverpool and Manchester, and hospitals in the south of England are starting to fill up. \u201cThe north-west is particularly under pressure; the highest infection rates are in the north-west. That translates into the highest number of admissions [being] in the north-west,\u201d Powis said at a press conference. \u201cBut \u2026 infection rates are now rising and rising faster in the south, [and] hospital admissions are beginning to rise in the south of the country too. Therefore our hospitals are beginning to fill in the south with coronavirus patients.\u201d Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, admitted that the pressure on hospitals from Covid-19 was increasing so sharply that the health service could have to abandon its ambition that patients seeking normal, non-Covid care during the second wave of the pandemic should be able to get it. \u201cThe truth, unfortunately, is that if coronavirus takes off again, that will disrupt services. We\u2019re seeing that in parts of the country where already hospitals are dealing with more coronavirus patients now than they were back in April,\u201d he said, citing Leeds as one place where hospitals have already had to cancel routine surgery. Hospitals in Liverpool, Nottingham, Yorkshire and Plymouth in Devon have done the same in recent weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, for example, that in the north-west of England a quarter of patients who would otherwise be having their routine operations, those beds, services and facilities are instead being having to [be] repurposed for coronavirus,\u201d said Stevens. He pleaded with the public to help protect the NHS by following the new rules that come into force on Thursday morning, as well as the government\u2019s \u201chands, face, space\u201d infection control advice. \u201cThe reality, I think, is that there is no health service in the world that by itself can cope with coronavirus on the rampage,\u201d he said. What he called \u201cthree lines of defence \u2013 the actions we take as individuals and families, [and] the efforts of the test-and-trace programme\u201d were vital to ensure the NHS was not overwhelmed, Stevens said. NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said the return to the highest level of emergency preparedness confirmed that \u201cthe health service is once again facing one of the most challenging periods in its history\u201d. Saffron Cordery, the organisation\u2019s deputy chief executive, said: \u201cDespite months of preparation for the second wave, this is going to be an extremely difficult winter for the NHS and will place a further burden on staff who have worked relentlessly since the start of the pandemic to care for patients.\u201d Planned surgery and cancer care may have to be scaled back to ensure hospitals can focus on Covid patients, she said. \u201cAlongside treating more Covid-19 patients than at the height of the first wave, trusts are also providing above-average levels of cancer care and planned surgery. But this is now under threat.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
