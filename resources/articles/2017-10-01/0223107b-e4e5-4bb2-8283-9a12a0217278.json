Catherine McGuinness, the most senior policy official at the City of London Corporation \u2013 the local authority for the Square Mile \u2013 told the chancellor on Wednesday that time was running out a deal to ease the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. In a letter to Hammond before next month\u2019s budget, McGuinness said the UK was facing a \u201chistorically defining moment\u201d and warned that the timetable for business to prepare for transition was \u201ctightening very rapidly\u201d. \u201cWe must have agreement with the EU on transition before the end of 2017,\u201d she added. Hammond was unable to guarantee that there would be any substantial progress on transitional arrangements with the EU by Christmas, a key demand of five major business lobby groups earlier this week. But he moved to reassure businesses that the UK was seeking to pin down some principles of the Brexit transition period as soon as possible, after Theresa May signalled that signing off the final arrangements could take another year. The prime minister delighted Eurosceptics when she told the Commons on Monday that there would be no transitional deal until the UK had settled its final relationship with the EU, which would not happen until next summer at the earliest and possibly not at all. However, Hammond struck a different tone 24 hours later, saying the matter of settling the transition period was \u201curgent and pressing\u201d for businesses. \u201cWhilst we are preparing for all outcomes in our negotiations, the government\u2019s objective is to reach a deal. As part of that deal, we want to agree an implementation period during which businesses and governments can prepare for the new relationship and we want to agree the principles of that period as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cLast week at the European council, the 27 agreed to start internal preparatory discussions on guidelines in relation to an implementation period. Together with broad support for the idea in parliament, this should give British businesses confidence we are going to provide them with the certainty they require.\u201d The City of London Corporation added its warning on Wednesday in McGuinness\u2019s letter to the chancellor. She said some businesses were already activating contingency plans and more would do so without more substance from the UK and EU on the length and nature of a transitional period to smooth the path to a future relationship after Brexit in March 2019. \u201cWhile businesses will have different cut-off points for activating contingency plans, clarity will be needed by the end of this year,\u201d she wrote to Hammond. \u201cFor businesses that have already begun activating contingency plans, clarity on transition will allow them to decelerate those plans. \u201cFor others, it may help them avoid taking unnecessary contingency measures entirely. The earlier transitional arrangements are agreed, the more value they will have for businesses and their customers.\u201d Labour and other MPs fighting a hard Brexit said on Tuesday that Hammond\u2019s remarks still did not offer enough reassurance and highlighted the lack of a plan for transition if the UK is forced to leave without a deal. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe prime minister yesterday sowed more confusion in her statement, giving the impression that a transition is to be negotiated only after we have settled on what the future partnership will be. Businesses cannot wait. They need to plan now. Jobs are in jeopardy now. \u201cIf the prime minister is not willing to stand up to the reckless Brexiteers in her party, will the chancellor? Will the chancellor make it clear, as business leaders have been calling for, that we need the principles of any transition confirmed by the end of this year?\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, joined those saying more clarity was needed. She tweeted on Monday: \u201cThe gulf between EU/business/post-Florence understanding of \u2018transition\u2019 and what PM now seems to be saying surely needs urgent resolution.\u201d After a discussion in the cabinet about the EU\u2019s progress to internal talks about the future relationship, No 10 also stressed that the UK would seek to agree \u201ca broad outline\u201d of the implementation phase as quickly as possible. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the PM has set out her commitment to getting an implementation and providing that certainty to business. It is within the EU\u2019s guidelines that they would like to have a period of transition. We believe we can work quickly together towards providing that certainty,\u201d Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman said. \u201cWhat the prime minister said is that the implementation period is about building a bridge and obviously in order to do that you need to know what the future relationship is going to look like. But what we would also say is that in terms of the broad outline of an implementation period, we believe that we can agree that quickly.\u201d However, some Brexit-supporting Tory MPs were delighted that May appeared to be standing firm against the demands from the CBI and others that she agree to a transitional period without a final deal being in place. John Redwood, a former Conservative cabinet minister, said: \u201cYou cannot have a transition unless you have in place an agreement about a new relationship which you are then going to move to. As the EU is not yet willing to negotiate a new relationship the idea of transition is premature. No relationship agreement, no transition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
