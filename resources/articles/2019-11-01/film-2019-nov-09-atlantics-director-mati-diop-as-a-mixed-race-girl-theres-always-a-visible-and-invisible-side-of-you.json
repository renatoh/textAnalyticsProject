Her cousin introduced her to some friends who were \u201cthinking about crossing\u201d; in other words, undertaking the dangerous boat journey up the west African coast and across to Spain. Diop was aware of the logical reasons that might motivate someone to take such a huge risk \u2013 namely, better financial prospects \u2013 but under the surface she detected something else. \u201cI could feel a viral phenomenon,\u201d she recalls. \u201cLike: \u2018My big brother\u2019s doing it, this kid from the neighbourhood is doing it, so I\u2019m gonna do it, too.\u2019 I was shocked by the magnetic feeling I had from it.\u201d The trip had a profound impact on Diop. One young man told her that \u201cwhen you decide to cross the ocean, it means that you\u2019re already dead\u201d. She soon began to feel that the boys she spoke to \u201cwere not here any more\u201d, and her perception of the country\u2019s landscape began to alter. \u201cI started to watch the ocean. I was not looking at it like I used to; it became like a grave.\u201d The result of that visit was a non-fiction piece called Atlantiques, in which a young man recounted his journey across the ocean. Now, 11 years on, the French director is gearing up to release her debut feature film of nearly the same name, Atlantics. This time, however, she has poured the otherworldly impressions of that 2008 visit into a work of odd, fantastical fiction. What starts out as a portrait of a group of young Senegalese labourers risking their lives to reach Europe soon gives way to a bubbly, edgy teen movie centred on a young girl called Ada (played by Mama San\u00e9). It then transforms into a cop caper/whodunnit. Finally the film mutates into a supernatural horror, replete with spooky graveyards, mystery illnesses, paranormal arson and white-eyed zombie-like creatures dead set on revenge. There is, it is fair to say, a lot going on in Atlantics, which has the backing of the streaming giant Netflix. And its heady synthesis of styles has already caused a significant stir. In June, it won the second biggest prize at Cannes, where Diop was the first black female film-maker to compete in the main competition in the festival\u2019s history. In August, she won the Mary Pickford award for outstanding female talent at the Toronto film festival. Shortly before we meet, it is announced that Atlantics will be Senegal\u2019s submission for the Academy Award for best international feature film. Today, Diop is not keen to dwell on her history-making festival stint. \u201cI think this situation is really behind me now,\u201d she says, describing the emphasis on the statistic in press coverage of Atlantics as \u201cfrustrating\u201d. She is, however, enthused by the Oscar nod, along with the other ways the film has helped her connect with her Senegalese heritage. Born in France to a French mother, Diop has said that creating the character of Ada was a way of experiencing \u201cthe African adolescence that I hadn\u2019t lived\u201d, a psychological exercise that helped her reconcile the two strands of her ancestry. \u201cAs a mixed [-race] girl, there\u2019s always a visible and invisible side of you; there\u2019s a place you inhabit and place you desert,\u201d she says. \u201cHow does the place that you don\u2019t live in influence you?\u201d Diop was also keen to push back against the western media\u2019s refugee narrative, whether it be coldly statistical or paralysingly sentimental. The original short was \u201creally about the reappropriation of its own story at a time when the approach in the media was only through the prism of economics,\u201d says Diop. \u201cIt was important to hear about this situation from another perspective, to humanise it. And when I say humanise it, it doesn\u2019t mean to be over-empathic, and try to make people cry and feel horrible about themselves.\u201d That said, she is not prepared to discuss the particulars of the French media\u2019s coverage of migration. \u201cI prefer to talk about my own relationship to that rather than going through an analysis of how the mass media treats this subject.\u201d Diop discusses her work with a fastidiousness and solemnity that reverberates through her entire person. She is especially scrupulous about the language used to frame her films. A description of the original Atlantiques as being about a young man\u2019s journey from Senegal to Spain is rebutted, \u201cbecause if it was that it would be very general. It\u2019s not me doing a short film about migration; it\u2019s a film into which a boy tells his own experience of crossing [the sea] to his two close friends and me.\u201d Neither should the short be referred to as a documentary. \u201cI call it a short film. Some people need to put a very strict frontier between documentary and fiction. I just don\u2019t consider cinema this way. I make films. I tell stories.\u201d One of Atlantics\u2019 impressively large number of narrative strands follows Ada\u2019s adolescent rebellion, and the film does an excellent job of evoking the texture of teenage life, beautifully capturing the schedule-free days, the intoxicating effect of rebellious friends, the ache and promise of first love. Coming-of-age stories are what make Diop tick. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very interested in adolescence, and because I\u2019m 37, it\u2019s both very far away and very close to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI love teenage movies, I love comedies about teenagers, I\u2019m a huge fan of [Kids director] Larry Clark.\u201d During her own teen years, Diop found herself compelled to express herself creatively, but struggled to settle on one medium. Inspired by her family \u2013 an artistic dynasty that includes her father Wasis, a musician known for fusing Senegalese folk with western pop, and her uncle Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty, also a Cannes-winning director (her mother is a photographer-turned-artistic director) \u2013 she dipped her toe into singing, photography, theatre and writing scores for plays before \u201cfinally the need of telling stories came\u201d. Yet it was as an actor that Diop first found acclaim, after being cast as one of the leads in Claire Denis\u2019 2008 drama 35 Shots of Rum. Before working with the feted French director, acting had been something Diop had \u201calways dreamed of\u201d, but she was conflicted about the concept of performing, feeling \u201ctoo shy\u201d as well as reluctant to be the subject of the male gaze. \u201cI was not very comfortable with the idea of being revealed by a man,\u201d she explains. \u201cI felt like they would consider me only because of my appearance and I didn\u2019t just want to be that.\u201d Her own films, on the other hand, have afforded Diop the chance to realise herself and her heritage on screen with far more nuance and depth, especially with regards to the sea-crossings that have shaped her paternal line. \u201cMy own personal story is: I\u2019m a daughter of an immigrant, who travelled to France right after shooting Touki Bouki with his brother, which is also a film about migration,\u201d she says. \u201cMy family history is made of migration; it\u2019s something that\u2019s part of my own complexity.\u201d It is a family tree that means Diop\u2019s work rings with an unsentimental but deeply felt empathy: Atlantics may be an otherworldly, genre-bending fantasy, but at its core it is a devastating, tragically evergreen memorial to those compelled to leave their homes at an unfathomable cost. Atlantics is on Netflix and limited UK cinemas from 29 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
