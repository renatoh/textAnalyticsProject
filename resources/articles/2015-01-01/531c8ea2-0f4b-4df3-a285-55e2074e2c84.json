The site of the pipeline break, six miles upstream from the high-plains city of Glendive, Montana, is almost entirely capped in ice, complicating efforts to retrieve the oil and slowing the response process. The cause of the spill remains under investigation. The conditions are changing quickly, sometimes by the hour, making it hard to for workers to plan the recovery, Bill Salvin, a spokesman for Bridger Pipeline, the Wyoming-based company which owns the pipeline, told the Guardian on Saturday. \u201cWe still obviously have a very serious issue here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had very limited success because of the conditions. It is extremely challenging and there are significant safety hazards for having people working on the ice.\u201d Salvin said crews had only been able to recover a small fraction of the oil that spilled into the Yellowstone. The crews, he said, had recovered 274 barrels of oil, or 11,500 gallons, the vast majority of which was inside the broken pipeline. Because of the conditions, crews have only been able to remove about 15 barrels, or roughly 630 gallons, of an oily, watery mix from the Yellowstone. As the weather warms, crews cannot rely on the ice to remain solid and are unable to bring heavy equipment. Salvin said crews were attempting to recover more oil from the river on Saturday. They were also using aerial photography to survey the river and scan for spots where they oil had pooled. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is overseeing the clean-up, in coordination with local agencies and Bridger Pipeline. Salvin said he was unsure how long the clean-up process would take. The pipeline is currently shut down. Salvin said the company anticipates re-opening the line on 31 March. Last Saturday, the 12in steel pipe that runs through Montana and into North Dakota ruptured beneath the Yellowstone, spilling 960 barrels of crude oil, or approximately 40,000 gallons into the river, Bridger said. Roughly an hour after the burst, the company shut down the pipeline in an effort to prevent more oil from spilling. By Sunday, several Glendive residents had reported a funny odor and taste in their water, prompting authorities to advise them not to drink or cook with tap water. Testing by the EPA found elevated levels of the cancer-causing chemical benzene in the city\u2019s water treatment plant, which serves some 6,000 residents. At a town meeting last week, residents were upset that officials waited until Monday \u2013 two days after the spill \u2013 to inform them about it, the Billings Gazette reported. \u201cI knew as soon as I smelled my water,\u201d resident Jerry Geiger told a panel of representatives from local, state and federal agencies and Bridger Pipeline employees, according to the paper. \u201cThe most important thing is telling us and letting us know what\u2019s going on. The city still should have put the word out,\u201d Geiger said. After five days of residents relying on bottled water, Montana\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) announced on Friday that Glendive\u2019s water treatment plant had been decontaminated and the city\u2019s water was safe to drink. Before drinking the water, however, residents were told to purge their systems, which requires running the taps for 15 to 20 minutes. \u201cThe primary concern has been restoring Glendive\u2019s drinking water supply to meet safe drinking water standards,\u201d said Tom Livers, the DEQ director, in a press release. \u201cThe response team has been working hard to restore water and help the community get its water back.\u201d The pipeline company has agreed to give each resident a $5 credit on their water bill to compensate them for the cost of the water used to flush their systems. Also on Friday, federal regulators with the Department of Transportation ordered Bridger Pipeline to make major improvements to the 42,000 barrel-per-day Poplar pipeline system, which carries crude oil from eastern Montana to North Dakota. The company had pledged this week to bury the pipeline deeper under the river to avoid future spills. It currently sits at least 8ft below the riverbed. In 2011, 63,000 gallons of oil leaked into the Yellowstone after an ExxonMobil pipeline burst."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
