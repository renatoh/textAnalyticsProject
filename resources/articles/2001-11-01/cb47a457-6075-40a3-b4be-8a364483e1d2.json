Ian Renton, Arena Racing director, said: \"It is a very exciting time for us and the surface should provide the best artificial ground. \"We believe this will be a new era for Lingfield racecourse and all-weather racing. We were delighted with the success of the trials and the trainers and jockeys who took part in them were unanimous in their praise and support for the new surface.\" Lingfield, who will let in racegoers free of charge this afternoon, will be hoping the track goes a long way to ending the criticism the track faced over its previous Equitrack surface. There was particular controversy last December when a meeting was abandoned at short notice. The runners were at the start for the first race when the track was deemed unsuitable for racing following complaints from riders. There had been no hint of any problem until it was discovered that part of the course was frozen and Arena Leisure was fined \u00a35,000 by the Jockey Club for mishandling the abandonment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
