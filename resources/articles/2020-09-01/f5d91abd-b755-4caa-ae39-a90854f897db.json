As trade talks hang by a thread in the face of a political showdown over the EU withdrawal agreement, sector leaders from across Europe predicted a wave of job losses in both factories and their suppliers if the UK crashes out of the single market. In a joint statement signed by 23 automotive trade associations, they say the calculated \u20ac110bn (\u00a3100bn) impact comes on top of the estimated \u20ac100bn cost of the Covid pandemic. \u201cThese figures paint a bleak picture of the devastation that would follow a no-deal Brexit. The shock of tariffs and other trade barriers would compound the damage already dealt by a global pandemic and recession, putting businesses and livelihoods at risk,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in the UK. Hildegard M\u00fcller, the president of the German automotive association, the VDA, said some businesses would be at risk if cross-border trade was hit by tariffs. \u201cThis would jeopardise closely linked value chains and possibly make them unprofitable. Our member companies have more than 100 production sites in the United Kingdom. We hope that the EU and the UK will continue their close partnership \u2013 with a comprehensive free trade agreement.\u201d The head of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, Eric-Mark Huitema, said it \u201cabsolutely must have an ambitious EU-UK trade agreement in place by January\u201d. Over the past two years, the auto industry has consistently warned of the deep cost of no deal on the car industry, which employs 14.6 million people directly and indirectly in factories, component supplies, engineering, design and marketing and sales. They hope this latest warning from the combined forces of leaders in both the EU and the UK will help both sides see past their political differences and strike a trade deal. Brexit talks are continuing this week, but on Sunday, Ireland\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said it would be difficult to conclude a trade deal if the British government passed legislation allowing it to renege on parts of the withdrawal agreement. The motor industry fears a collapse in talks would mean punitive tariffs \u2013 10% on car sales and 22% on vans and trucks, but also hit jobs and sales revenues that underpins more than \u20ac60bn investment in technical innovation and research every year, which Sigrid de Vries, the secretary general of the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) said makes it \u201cthe EU\u2019s largest private R&amp;D investor\u201d. Its latest calculations suggest production levels would fall by 3m units in the UK and the EU over the next five years in a no-deal scenario. This is on top of a 3.6m reduction in the annual 18.6m units produced a year because of coronavirus. In a separate development, the Unite union has warned of border chaos in Britain unless \u201cdecisive action is taken over incomplete IT systems to deal with post-Brexit customs\u201d, along with plans, revealed last week, for 29 lorry parks across the country to deal with possible delays at Dover. Deal or no deal, drivers on trucks carrying car components and other products face a fine of \u00a3300 if they do not have the correct and completed paperwork to cross the Channel. Unite said it was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d to penalise drivers \u201cwho are not responsible for preparing customs declarations for their loads\u201d. The union\u2019s national officer, Adrian Jones, said border chaos would also come at a great cost not only to drivers but to local authorities, who with \u201cless than four months to go\u201d still do not know the locations of the majority of lorry parks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
