Federal judge Alvin Hellerstein said the proposed payout was not a fair deal for about 10,000 police officers, firefighters and labourers made sick by the dust and debris. Under the settlement, the amount received by each responder is based on a complicated points system that would give some workers only a few thousand dollars while others might qualify for $1m or more. The judge said he was concerned too much of the money would be eaten up by legal fees and that the plaintiffs were being pressured into signing up to the agreement before they knew how much they stood to receive. A third or more of the cash was expected to go to lawyers. Workers have been given just 90 days to decide whether they agree to the terms, far too short a time for such an important decision, said Hellerstein. \"I will not preside over a settlement that is based on fear or ignorance,\" he said. Hellerstein, who rules over all federal court litigation related to the terror attacks, had heard from several tearful responders speaking about their illnesses, and received letters and phone calls from others expressing confusion about the deal. The settlement has taken years to negotiate and was announced last week. Hellerstein said more negotiations were now needed. The payouts will come from a fund set up after the attacks when New York City was unable to find private insurance to cover claims originating from the clean-up effort."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
