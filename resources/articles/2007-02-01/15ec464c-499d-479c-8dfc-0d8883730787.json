Raising the leaving age to 18, setting up an education commission and handing over funding for 16- to 19-year-olds from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to local authorities would certainly mark out a Brown regime. Hardly a week goes by without discussion of a new statutory leaving age, floated by Alan Johnson, the education secretary, last year. Rightly, ministers have talked about a statutory learning-leaving age, rather than school-leaving, emphasising further education and work-based learning and part-time as well as full-time education and training. A leaving age of 18 raises serious questions. What role would schools, colleges and work-based learning providers have in monitoring attendance? And what responsibilities would local authorities and local LSC area partnerships have in enforcement? Labour has been spot-on in establishing a joint Cabinet Office/Department for Education and Skills (DfES) working group to get the policy details right. Less well formed is the notion of an education commission. The purpose of commissions is to take the politics out of critical policy issues. The prototype is the UK-wide commission for employment and skills, recommended by the Leitch review. The key argument for an education commission in England is the need for the Treasury to monitor more closely the impact of higher education spending on educational attainment, an argument strengthened if Brown means business in closing the funding gap between state and private education. Whether an education commission focused on local authorities, schools and closing the funding gap between state and private education would be in the interests of FE is debatable. Reduce that gap and you risk widening the funding gap between sixth forms and colleges. A pre-19 education and skills commission would be better placed to guard against that. And it would sit more easily with a statutory leaving age at 18, where vocational as well as academic attainment would need to be monitored. Then there is the question posed by the Lyons review of local government: should the LSC keep hold of the \u00a36bn 16-19 budget in England, or should it go to local authorities? Devolution, especially to local authorities, is high on Brown's agenda. Sir Michael Lyons is right to ask whether the \u00a36bn should be transferred to local authorities. The whole purpose of the 10-year comprehensive spending review - which the Lyons review and the sub-national review of economic regeneration feed into - is to consider whether current institutional structures are \"fit for purpose\". But you can't just transfer 16-19 LSC funding to local authorities in the name of devolution. It must be good for 14-19 education and skills, as well as for local democracy, and it must be good for rolling out specialised diplomas and upping the learning-leaving age by 2013. As a policy option, shifting 16-19 LSC funding to town halls is of the same magnitude as setting a statutory learning-leaving age at 18. It is difficult to imagine how the Lyons review could make such a recommendation without a thorough investigation of the advantages and disadvantages for 14-19 education. If there is a Cabinet Office working group looking at all the ramifications of raising the leaving age, there should also be one to look at transferring the 16-19 budget. If a Brown government ultimately decides to hand over the 16-19 LSC budget to local authorities by 2013, local government cannot expect unfettered devolution. There will have to be safeguards to make sure further education and apprenticeships for the 14-19 age group get a fair share of the funding. That would be a good job for a pre-19 education and skills commission in the new Brown era. \u00b7 Mark Corney is director of MC Consultancy"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
