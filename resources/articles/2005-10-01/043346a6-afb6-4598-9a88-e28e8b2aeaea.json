The job advertisements in the pages that follow this one are only a drop in the bucket. The economy at large may be slowing, but personnel departments in health, town halls, even central government are still going great guns. That figure is, admittedly, an extrapolation of the rate of growth of employment in the 12 months up to the end of June. Expansion was, it's true, slightly down on 2003-04, but there is no good reason why growth shouldn't be continuing this year into next and the one after. Public spending is still rising, mightily. Given that a lot of the spending goes on people, vacancy signs are still lit. What about all those primary care trusts being culled, and dark tales of redundancies in health? At the same time GP surgeries, flush with cash, are recruiting like mad. Jobs totals are politically sensitive but ongoing expansion was acknowledged last year, at the same time as Gordon Brown announced his cuts in civil service numbers. On the back of the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Whitehall was quick to point out that, if you allow for reclassification of courts staff, the number of civil servants did fall by 12,000 or 2.1% in 2004-05 - though if you include the armed forces and other bits of central government, it accounted for well over half the expansion. So there is both more and less than meets the eye in ONS's headline total of 5.8 million public sector staff, up 95,000 on the previous year (and up 670,000 on Labour's first year in office). The official definition of public sector excludes further education colleges and universities, which to all intents and purposes are public bodies and together would add at least half a million to the total. Then there are all those bodies that depend entirely on government grants, not just voluntary bodies either. The hue and cry about bloated Labour payrolls looks a bit odd when you think back to Margaret Thatcher, who bequeathed John Major a public sector nearly 6 million people strong. Still, Labour has done what Labour governments always do and presided over the expansion of a social category that has tended to vote Labour. That is ironic because Blair has long been persuaded by Julian Le Grand (a professor who is now back at the London School of Economics after a spell as a No 10 adviser) that Labour has wrongly pumped money into public services at the expense of tackling inequality head on by redistributing cash directly to the less well off. Under Blair, public sector employment has grown from 19.5% of total employment to 20.3%. To put that a bit more colourfully: while the private sector workforce has increased by 6% since 1997, the public sector payroll has grown by 11%. But, true to Labour pledges, the money bought more teachers and nurses. Education employment rose by over 19% and health by nearly 24% (figures for the period 1997 to first quarter 2004). However impressive the bulk of Society Guardian jobs pages, it is worth noting that social care shrank by more than 9%. Government ministers could, if they chose, see off the Conservative contention that most of these new jobs are non-jobs - before the election, rightwing commentators loved to plunder these pages, until they realised that smoking cessation was a bone fide object of public policy and most specialist advisers in the field did a useful and productive job. Instead of blowing the trumpet, ministers tend to go shy and quiet, bowing their necks as the economists trot out figures for decline in productivity and blame it on growth in public service employment. The appropriate response is, we do not know much about public service productivity but we do know that conventional definitions in the National Accounts are thin and capture little of the value added by both frontline and back-office staff. The latest figures will steel the arm of Treasury officials when they get tough on public sector pay next spring. They may not control numbers, but they will try to restrain pay. One reason for the recent spurt in public sector earnings relative to private is the shift in employment away from lower-paid manual and clerical jobs (many now contracted out) to supervisory and professional work. Another is decentralised recruitment and the way public sector managers have, in a tighter labour market, been willing to pay a bit more to keep people they value. The signs are that the government wants to screw down the 2006 round - except perhaps for top people, for whom forthcoming senior pay reviews will doubtless recommend more, not less, \"flexibility\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
