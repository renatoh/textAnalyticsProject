Yet, as the newly published final volume of Henry-Louis de la Grange's gargantuan biography of the composer points out, Mahler was in pretty good and purposive spirits when he wrote the work 100 years ago this summer. It is a mistake to approach Das Lied as the anguished farewell to the world by a dying man, and it is to Christoph Eschenbach's credit that he avoided that ever-seductive trap in this performance. Like many bigger voiced tenors before him, Nikolai Schukoff was simply overwhelmed by the orchestration of the opening drinking song. He was able to make more impact in the tenor's two more lightly scored numbers, though his voice ultimately lacks the ring that this role really demands. Petra Lang, a luxury substitution for the indisposed Mihoko Fujimura, supplied greater vocal presence, poignantly capturing the loneliness of her first song and the serenity of her second, before rising to the extended challenge of Der Abschied with a lustrous dignity and care for phrasing that is truer to the work than some more histrionic performances. The London Philharmonic played most beautifully for Eschenbach, with the woodwinds especially fine in their many atmospheric solo phrases. Much thought and work had clearly gone into this performance. Yet, in the end, Eschenbach's direction was too careful and too controlled to yield a classic performance. As in his very severe performance of Schubert's Unfinished symphony before the interval, there was much exquisite playing and refined detail. But the creative flame of both works seemed to get doused along the way. Something has gone wrong when you come away from a performance of Das Lied von der Erde thinking that it was a bit dull."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
