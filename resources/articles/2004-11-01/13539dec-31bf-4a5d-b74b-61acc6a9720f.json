The Catalan club, who face Larsson's former team Celtic at Camp Nou tonight, said the original one-year contract he signed would have been extended if he had played 60% of matches [this season], but given the impossibility now of reaching such a figure they had decided to renew the deal automatically until June 2006. \"I have offered a contract renewal to Larsson so that he can put his mind at rest during this difficult time,\" said Joan Laporta, the Barcelona president. \"We want him to concentrate on recovering.\" After keyhole surgery had revealed torn cruciate knee ligaments, the 33-year-old striker voiced uncertainty about his future . \"I can't say if I will continue or quit before I have all the cards on the table,\" Larsson said. \"Right now everything is just so grim and tiring. I had really hoped it would not be so serious.\" Larsson, who has scored 32 goals in 82 appearances for Sweden, signed for Barcelona at the start of the season after spending seven successful years in Scotland. He becomes the fourth Bar\u00e7a player to be ruled out for the remainder of the season because of injury. Thiago Motta, Edmilson and Gabri suffered almost identical injuries during the last two months, which has led to concerns about the quality of the Camp Nou pitch. Milan, who need one point to qualify for the Champions League knockout phase, are set to face Shakhtar Donetsk with a makeshift attack at the San Siro tonight. A host of injuries have left the coach Carlo Ancelotti few options up front. Andrei Shevchenko, who accounts for half of all his team's goals in Serie A and Europe, is likely to be absent because of a thigh strain, while his regular striking partner Jon Dahl Tomasson has not yet recovered from a pulled muscle. Filippo Inzaghi is also out after undergoing surgery on an ankle injury. In their absence, Ancelotti is expected to field an unfamiliar formation with Hernan Crespo as a lone striker, backed up by Rui Costa and Kaka. Crespo has struggled since his loan from Chelsea. But the Argentinian scored his first goal of the season in the 2-1 Italian Cup win over Palermo at the weekend. \"There's not much we can do. Crespo is coming into form, but we don't have many alternatives.\" said Milan's captain Paolo Maldini."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
