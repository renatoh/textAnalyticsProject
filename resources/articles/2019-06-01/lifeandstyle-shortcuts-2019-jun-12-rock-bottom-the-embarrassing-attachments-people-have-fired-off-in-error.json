You message a company on Facebook to arrange a quote \u2013 and end up sending a picture of your bottom. In a Facebook post that went viral, a hairdresser from Wigan relayed her story about being asked by a carpet company to send photographs of her stairs, and mistakenly attaching one of her bare behind. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely mortified,\u201d she wrote on her post, followed by several crying laughing emojis (the company responded in kind, before reassuring her the photo would go no further). \u201cMake sure u check what u click,\u201d she concluded. There have been other examples of photos that have been accidentally shared and widely covered: the Canadian woman who, in 2012, uploaded a hilarious photo of Nicolas Cage instead of a covering letter for a job application; in 2015, a man in Chicago lost a job offer after he mistakenly sent nude photos of himself to the human resources manager. More recently, a test email \u2013 which wasn\u2019t meant to be sent at all \u2013 was distributed by the US embassy in Australia, titled \u201cmeeting\u201d and containing a photograph of a cat wearing a Cookie Monster suit. On Twitter, people have shared some joyful examples (if true \u2013 the \u201cI accidentally sent this to my boss\u201d tweet is often too good to be believable). Instead of his coursework, one person attached a photograph of a cat eyeing up a pile of hotdogs. Another sent a work email with a picture of Buddy from the film Elf attached. Another mistakenly sent her boss an illustration of a sad-faced heart with the words: \u201cI just want a cuddle.\u201d Less cute, but equally excruciating, is Guardian reader Shahnawaz Khan\u2019s experience. At university he was an activist and served as the national secretary of one of India\u2019s largest student organisations. He sent a report about a potentially discriminatory job advert to three colleagues, including a superior. \u201cI woke up the next morning when a senior colleague called to ask if I had lost my mind.\u201d Instead of the job advertisement, the attachment was a news story in Hindi, about a man doing something unspeakable to a dog (leading the poor animal to lose its appetite). A friend had downloaded it on to Khan\u2019s computer and saved it with a similar file name. \u201cI spent the entire day embarrassed and in fear of being asked to explain, or worse.\u201d New technology has added to the minefield. Spare a thought for Annabel Kelly\u2019s husband. She reports that her 10-year-old daughter \u201ctold Siri to \u2018call me super duper poopy poop\u2019 on my husband\u2019s work iPad. He sent professional emails with this new display name.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
