Cafu: Solid all round performance and did what was clearly asked of him which was to sit back and defend. Few forward runs but made an important contribution. 8/10 . Lucio: Recovered from the quarter-final when his mistake led to Michael Owen's goal. Comfortable on the ball and made a number of dangerous forward runs, particularly from set plays. 8/10 . Roque Junior: Looked a little shaky in the first half but became more comfortable dealing with the German attack in the second half. 7/10 . Edmilson: The poorest of the Brazilian defenders, particularly in the air. Lucky that his defence covered for him, particularly in the first half when he looked vulnerable to German attacks. 6/10 . Roberto Carlos: Like Cafu had little chance to get forward and never threatened from free-kicks. Good defensive work however, negating the German threat on the wing. 8/10 . Gilberto Silva: Battled hard in midfield to break up German attacks, particularly in the first half. His efforts allowed the flair players around him to express themselves. 8/10 . Ronaldo: Hard to argue with a player who has scored eight goals in the tournament. But missed two great chances in the first half when he could have added to his tally. 8/10 . Rivaldo: Helped set up Ronaldo's first goal but overall made little impact on the match, rarely disrupting the German defence. Got little service however which would have made him more effective. 7/10 . Ronaldinho: Once again another eye-catching performance of skill and talent. At the centre of most of Brazil's attacks and proved what a valuable asset he is to the team. 9/10 . Kleberson: Unlucky to hit the bar towards the end of the first half. Battled hard to break down German attacks and was excellent in winning the ball and helping Brazil to counter attack. 8/10 . Substitutes: Juninho: Looked tricky when he came on towards the end but had little time to make an impact, which is a shame because his skill deserved to grace the match. 7/10 . Denilson: Troubled the German defence when he came on and almost helped set up a third goal. Came on late in the match and so had little time to make an impact. 6/10. GERMANY Oliver Kahn: Failed to hold on to Rivaldo's shot, but made some excellent saves before then, proving that he is one of the best keepers in the tournament. Poor show on the first goal however. 7/10 . Thomas Linke: Managed to minimise the threat of Roberto Carlos and made some excellent tackles. Faded later on though. 8/10 . Carsten Ramelow: Dominated at the back, controlled the defence superbly and rarely looked troubled throughout. 8/10 . Oliver Neuville: Linked up well with midfield and made a number of dangerous forward runs, particularly in the first half. 8/10 . Dietmar Hamann: Probably one of his best performances for Germany. Battled hard in midfield, won the ball regularly and patrolled the middle of the pitch with authority. 9/10 . Miroslav Klose: Made little impact on the Brazilian defence. Once again his performance was marked by a tendency to go down too quickly when tackled. 6/10 . Jens Jeremies: Worked hard in midfield but no replacement for Ballack. Lacked creativity and did little with the ball when he had it. 6/10 . Marco Bode: Like Linke on the other side he rarely found himself on the back foot against Cafu, but caused problems with his raids down the flank. 7/10 . Bernd Schneider: Linked up well with the attack and was a constant problem to the Brazilian defence. Played a number of piercing passes that were not seized upon by the German attackers. 8/10 . Christoph Metzelder: Tried his best but was no match for the experience of Brazil's three Rs. Tired in the second half. 7/10 . Torsten Frings: Won the ball regularly and helped to put a number of German attacks into motion. Had at least two shots that he should have done better with but his contribution was crucial. 9/10 . Substitutes: Oliver Bierhoff: Rarely threatened in the air and had one shot well saved by Marcos. Had little service. 7/10 . Gerald Asamoah: Tried his best but there there was little he could do by the time he came on. Let down by those around him, who appeared tired. 8/10 . Christian Ziege: Managed to get in a number of dangerous crosses that the German attack should have done better with. The team looked more dangerous when he came on and he should have started the match. 8/10 ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
