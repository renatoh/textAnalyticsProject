Millwall beat Leicester City on Saturday with a last-minute goal from the full-back Shaun Cummings to add the Premier League champions to Bournemouth and Watford on the list of top-flight teams knocked out of this season\u2019s tournament at The Den. But Harris believes the result could have been different had the visitors shown the same clinical approach as his own team. \u201cYou beat one Premier League team it\u2019s a shock,\u201d he said, \u201cto beat a second one you\u2019ve done really, really well, but to beat three... that\u2019s some achievement. That\u2019s a testimony to my players, to their hunger and their willingness to learn. If you go into big games, should you spend more time on the opposition? We don\u2019t, we do the same diligence for every game and it\u2019s just been about players being able to raise their game. \u201cThere were moments in each half where our keeper, Jordan Archer, made really good saves and you just want those moments to go in your favour,\u201d he continued. \u201cClaudio Ranieri would say it was really poor finishing by them, though. I expect my strikers to be clinical and the difference between Shinji Okazaki [who had two good chances saved by Archer] and Shaun Cummings was that Cummings was clinical.\u201d Archer was signed by Millwall from Tottenham two years ago, initially on loan then permanently the following summer, and Harris praised the 23-year-old\u2019s performance. \u201cHe\u2019s come from Spurs to us because he\u2019s desperate to be number one at a young age,\u201d said the manager. \u201cHe\u2019s got hunger and appetite to be better all the time and when I wasn\u2019t playing him last year, he was banging my door down. He wants to play, he doesn\u2019t like being dropped and I think he showed his quality today.\u201d Harris was sympathetic to the plight of his opposite number, Ranieri, who is confronting the possibility of being relegated a season after winning the Premier League title. \u201cI feel for him today,\u201d he said. \u201cAll players and managers have been on the wrong end of results like this and they caught us at a bad time today. They caught us at a time when we\u2019re really good. I feel for him because he\u2019s a legend in the game. He\u2019s a top guy from what I understand and I love watching his teams play. He\u2019s got a great group of players, they\u2019ll be fine this year.\u201d The Metropolitan police confirmed on Sunday that three people had been arrested following the pitch invasion at the end of the match during which missiles, mostly plastic bottles, were thrown between rival supporters. It also confirmed that there had been a specific policing plan in place for the match, which included the use of police horses. \u201cOfficers dealt with disorder following the Millwall v Leicester City FA Cup tie on Saturday\u201d, a spokesman for the Met said. \u201cThree men were arrested on suspicion of affray. All three currently remain in custody pending further inquires. A policing plan was in place for the game and additional officers were deployed.\u201d It is also understood that the Football Association are to look into the matter, while reports in the Leicester Mercury claimed away supporters had been intimidated throughout the match. \u201cIt was really scary,\u201d one fan said. \u201cWe were abused throughout the match and had coins thrown at us. Our bus was also attacked on the way out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
