While the prime minister took a whistlestop tour of European capitals on Tuesday in an effort to win fresh concessions from EU leaders, MPs were lobbying colleagues to submit letters of no confidence in her leadership to Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers. Friends of Brady refused to deny reports he would meet May after her regular appearance at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday lunchtime. He would have to inform her first, before calling any no confidence vote. There was fevered speculation at Westminster on Tuesday night that the threshold of 48 letters \u2013 which would trigger a vote \u2013 had finally been reached. The former environment secretary Owen Paterson, a prominent leave campaigner who has been a trenchant critic of the prime minister\u2019s approach, made his own letter of no confidence public. He said May\u2019s deal represented a series of \u201cbroken promises\u201d and was the culmination of \u201cmore than two years of poor government decision-making\u201d. Several prominent Tories, including Boris Johnson, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd, are known to be contemplating running if May loses a confidence vote. Many of the most prominent May sceptics were wary of making predictions, bruised by the last time the letters failed to materialise. One Brexiter MP said he knew colleagues who had spent the day lobbying others to send in their letters. Another said: \u201cDo I think we\u2019re there yet tonight? I\u2019m not sure, but I think we will be tomorrow.\u201d Others played down the prospect of the threshold being reached. Brady said last month that party rules made clear any vote of no confidence should take place \u201cexpeditiously\u201d. \u201cThe intention is clear that if it were to happen, it ought to be a test of opinion, very quickly, in order to clear the air and get it out of the way so that the party, the government at the moment, can move on,\u201d he said. A vote of Tory MPs could take place within days and if May lost it she would not be able to stand in the subsequent leadership contest, which could run through the Christmas recess. Meanwhile the EU is moving into full no-deal mode, with May\u2019s shock decision to pull Tuesday\u2019s vote on her Brexit deal prompting Brussels\u2019 chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to warn privately of a sudden escalation of risk. May is due to hold a cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon before flying to Dublin to meet the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. As she shuttled between EU capitals on a whistlestop diplomatic tour aimed at salvaging her deal, the prime minister said the hastily scheduled cabinet meeting would discuss what further steps the government needed to take in the event of a no-deal Brexit. One cabinet source said ministers had been told they would see \u201cquite an alarming no-deal paper\u201d that would emphasise the need to step up preparations. With May declining to set a date when her deal will be brought back to parliament for ratification, and her spokesman saying only that it would be before 21 January, France advised its fellow member states that planning for a cliff-edge Brexit had to be their priority. France\u2019s EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, on a visit to Brussels, suggested her country\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, would urge EU leaders at a summit starting on Thursday to take responsibility for their own preparations rather than be sucked into May\u2019s domestic political drama. Loiseau said: \u201cWe are very concerned about the delay in the vote on the withdrawal agreement, because this withdrawal agreement is the best deal possible, it is even the only possible agreement. It has been negotiated for months.\u201d Barnier is understood to have given a stark analysis of the situation in a meeting with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and his fellow commissioners, suggesting that the danger of a complete breakdown had significantly increased. The European commission is to publish fresh no-deal warnings next week. During a visit to Berlin, May was reportedly told by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that there could be no renegotiation and that any appeals for help should be made in Brussels rather than brought to the capitals. Varadkar took the unusual step of suggesting to the Irish parliament that it was still in Downing Street\u2019s gift to prevent a no-deal by revoking article 50 and turning its back on Brexit. He said: \u201cThe option is there to revoke article 50, the option is there to extend article 50 and, where there may not be a majority for anything or at least any deal at the moment in the House of Commons, I do believe there\u2019s a majority that the UK should not be plunged into a no-deal scenario.\u201d Cabinet sources said the prime minister had warned colleagues on Monday\u2019s cabinet conference call, when she discussed postponing the vote, that reopening the withdrawal agreement would be risky, not least because Varadkar could insist that the Northern Ireland-only backstop be restored to the text. May held talks with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, in The Hague on Tuesday morning before going on to Berlin for talks with Merkel. The German chancellor reported to the parliamentary faction of the CDU/CSU alliance of which she is a member that she had excluded the possibility with May of reopening Brexit negotiations. \u201cWe said that there will be no further opening of the exit deal,\u201d Merkel said. The prime minister later conducted talks with Juncker and Donald Tusk, the European council president. Following his meeting with May, Tusk tweeted that the pair had a \u201clong and frank\u201d discussion. \u201cClear that EU27 wants to help,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe question is how.\u201d Earlier in the day, Juncker had told the European parliament that there was \u201cno room whatsoever for renegotiation\u201d, but that the EU could offer \u201cclarifications and interpretations\u201d to help the prime minister secure MPs\u2019 support. Many Labour MPs including the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, have argued that there is a parliamentary majority to stop a no-deal exit, calling it a \u201cfalse choice\u201d between May\u2019s deal and no deal. However, Commons officials believe it would be very difficult in practice. MPs opposed to no deal had believed one legal route could be to amend the primary legislation, such as an immigration bill, that would be needed for a semi-orderly no-deal exit to allow parliament to insist on an extension to article 50. Yet experts have come to believe that those amendments may not be within the scope of the bills and that the amendments could not impose conditions on whether no-deal happens or not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
