Instead, the work has been engraved by micro-artist Graham Short on to a 2cm x 1cm chemotherapy pill, in what Short said was probably the hardest job had had ever done. Entitled Finishing It, the poem \u2013 Armitage\u2019s second as poet laureate \u2013 was commissioned by the Institute of Cancer Research in London. It is intended to symbolise the new generation of cancer treatments that the Institute\u2019s planned Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery will create, and which it hopes will turn cancer into a manageable disease. \u201cI can\u2019t configure / a tablet / chiselled by God\u2019s finger,\u201d writes Armitage. Instead, the poet has crafted \u201cthe sugared pill / of a poem, one sentence / that speaks ill // of illness itself\u201d. Running to 51 words, the poem was given to Short to engrave on a replica chemotherapy pill, which is intended to represent the drugs that the Institute hopes to develop in the new centre. \u201cThe pill kept crumbling and it was so difficult to do,\u201d said Short, who swims 10,000 metres a day to lower his resting pulse rate, and works from midnight to 5am to avoid vibrations from passing traffic. \u201cI work in an unusual way, wearing a stethoscope and taking tablets to get my heart rate down to 20-25 bpm. What I\u2019m trying to do then, using very fine needles, is engrave between heartbeats.\u201d Short\u2019s tablet will be displayed in the Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery when it opens in 2020. Currently under construction \u2013 and still requiring an additional \u00a314m in donations to be completed \u2013 the centre is intended to bring together hundreds of scientists to collaborate on a programme that will overcome cancer\u2019s ability to develop resistance to drugs. Armitage said: \u201cScience and poetry are closer associates than many people assume, and it was exciting to work on a project that deals with cutting-edge medical research. And like science, poetry is a \u2018what if\u2019 activity, imagining outcomes and possibilities based on creative thinking. \u201cI liked the sense that poem and pill might collaborate to produce both a medical and emotional cure, and that something so minimalist could aim to bring down something so enormous and destructive. I experimented for a long time with the language \u2013 the shortest poems are always the hardest to write, their smallness making them so much more conspicuous and vulnerable.\u201d Dr Olivia Rossanese, who will be head of biology in the new centre, said that Armitage\u2019s poem \u201cbeautifully shares our story and symbolises the hope of what\u2019s to come, the message made more powerful by being engraved on a pill that represents the kinds of treatments that we will be developing in the very near future\u201d. The centre, she added, would \u201coffer a completely new and remarkable way of working\u201d, with computational biologists, geneticists, evolutionary scientists and drug discovery researchers \u201call working hand-in-hand in an unprecedented way\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
