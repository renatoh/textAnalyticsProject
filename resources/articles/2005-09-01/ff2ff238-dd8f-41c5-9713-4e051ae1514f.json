Mr Clarke has had a good start to his third leadership campaign, with a poll last night finding him the first choice of 40% of all voters. The former chancellor has already distanced himself from his former enthusiasm for the EU, calling the single currency a \"failure\" and declaring the EU constitution a dead issue. But, as the only pro-EU candidate standing, he was clearly the target of Mr Ancram's comment today that a future leader should not be \"fobbed off by Euro-flattery\". In a speech prepared for his constituency party in Wiltshire but released in advance, the Eurosceptic Mr Ancram - a former shadow foreign secretary - said: \"If the outcome of the Conservative leadership contest is to be positive, it can't just be based on personalities. We need a comprehensive debate on the issues. \"I therefore find it quite astonishing that, so far, Europe appears to have been marked 'not for immediate discussion' and sidelined. The future structure of the European Union and its impact on our national sovereignty lie at the very heart of Conservatism. It cannot just be swept under the carpet.\" Mr Ancram, who is not standing for the party leadership this time, repeated his call for the renegotiation of existing EU treaties in order reverse the \"surrender\" of areas of sovereignty to Brussels. \"We need to produce a leader who will stand up for Britain rather than being fobbed off by Euro-flattery. \"We urgently need a leader with the courage, the passion, the ability and the determination to preserve our sovereignty.\" Mr Clarke was picked as best choice for leader last night by 40% of voters polled for BBC2's Newsnight, well ahead of bookies' favourite David Davis, who enjoyed the support of just 10%. A Populus poll in today's Times found 41% of the public now think Mr Clarke would make the best leader, compared with 29% in mid-July. Meanwhile, the other \"centre left\" candidate standing in the race, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, today began a 12-day tour of the country, meeting activists in constituencies with little or no Tory representation, to highlight his message that there must not be any \"no-go areas\" for Conservatives. \"Conservatives must make as our priority the rebuilding of our party as a one nation party with support throughout the UK,\" he said. \"Our plans for rebuilding the party must be focused on how we can win back support in those areas of Britain where Conservative support has declined. That's why I have deliberately chosen to concentrate on areas of Britain in which there are few Conservative MPs and where the Conservative party needs to build its strength if it is to return to government.\" Sir Malcolm represents the wealthiest constituency in the country, Kensington and Chelsea, and, coming from one of the most upmarket parts of Edinburgh, has had to fight perceptions of him as a \"Scottish toff\". Sir Malcolm's tour will begin in Derbyshire today, and he will also make speeches and meet activists in London, Edinburgh, Ayr, Cardiff, Swansea, Wakefield, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Leicestershire, Bath, Newcastle and Croydon ahead of next month's Conservative annual conference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
