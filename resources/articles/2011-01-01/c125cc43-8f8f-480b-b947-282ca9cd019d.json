The International Labour Organisation warned that the global economy risked repeating last year's jobless recovery, which added 4.75% to global GDP but relatively few extra jobs, if cuts were given precedence over growth. Figures compiled from most of the world's developing and developed nations showed the number of unemployed remained at 205 million in 2010. Unemployment in the UK is rising, with many economists blaming the Treasury's tax increases and spending cuts. In the three months to last November, the unemployment rate rose to 7.9%, with the number out of work nearing 2.5 million. The ILO also criticised developing nations for \"simply not generating sufficient employment opportunities to absorb growth in the working-age population\". Countries such as China and Brazil created jobs during 2010 but only enough to offset a fall in the US and Europe. The warning came as the outgoing director general of the CBI, Sir Richard Lambert, criticised the government's lack of strategy for economic growth as jeopardising output and employment. Lambert said the government had pursued spending cuts at the expense of consistent policies that supported growth. The employers' body believes that business investment and exports will drive growth in the coming years and called on the government to deliver policies that helped the private sector to expand and create jobs. \"But it [the government] is by no means firing on all cylinders in this important respect,\" said Lambert. \"The growth white paper that was promised last autumn never materialised, and the impression was given that there simply weren't enough good ideas around to justify such a publication. \"Rather than a big picture of the kind of economic eco-system that the government wants to champion, we are left with a few rather vague ideas about the scope for supporting a number of predictable sectors, and the promise that more ideas will be forthcoming at the time of the spring budget.\" Tomorrow the Office for National Statistics publishes its initial estimate of GDP growth in the final quarter of 2010. Most economists believe the slowdown from 1.1% in the second quarter to 0.7% in the third quarter will continue, with a growth rate of 0.4% in the last three months as a result of spending cuts squeeze and tax rises implemented by the Treasury. George Osborne has argued that a regional growth fund and support for businesses through a variety of measures will maintain growth. However, Lambert said a series of micro policy initiatives failed to qualify as a clear strategy. He cited the impact of the government's immigration cap on businesses and universities, the uncertainty injected into the planning system by the localism agenda, the abolition of the default retirement age, the extra \u00a31bn tax on business from the carbon reduction commitment, the lack of an aviation policy for south-east England, and the Financial Services Authority's review of mortgages, which was making home loans harder to obtain. \"The politics that are behind many of these initiatives are clear enough. But it's odd that the government should be willing to push aside short-term political considerations when it comes to making spending cuts, but not when it's addressing the growth agenda.\" Lambert also warned company executives that they needed to show sensitivity over pay at a time of public austerity. \"There is a link between public trust and the pace of growth in corporate compensation for big companies, and not just in the banking sector,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
