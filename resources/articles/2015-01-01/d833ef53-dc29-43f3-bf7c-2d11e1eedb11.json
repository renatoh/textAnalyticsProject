In a keynote speech at thinktank the Institute for Government on Monday, the Liberal Democrat MP for Yeovil said he thought that the way the coalition was formed in May 2010, without the then head of the civil service, Gus O\u2019Donnell, in attendance, allowed politicians to \u201ccut to the chase more quickly and have slightly more candid, productive arguments\u201d. He said that coalition talks are more effective when politicians don\u2019t \u201cfeel they\u2019re being minuted and recorded by civil servants than when they feel that everything is being done in a more public way\u201d. Laws argued that it can be difficult for the civil service to maintain complete independence when it is drawn in to advising different political parties. He continued: \u201cI think it was William Hague in May 2010 who joked, when we locked Gus O\u2019Donnell out of the door \u2026 that at least now he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about freedom of information requests coming in about what we were discussing and, sure enough, on the very last day of the coalition talks \u2026 the civil service received the first freedom of information request from some industrious journalist asking for the minutes from all our coalition talks. We were able to say quite honestly that there were no government minutes.\u201d In a speech that responded to a report from the Institute of Government on effective governance, Laws predicted that possible coalition negotiations after the upcoming general election would take about two days more than the five days it took to form the current government. The uncertain economic situation put pressure on the Liberal Democrats to reach a quick coalition deal with the Conservative party in 2010, argued Laws, and parties involved in coalition deals in May will expect much more detailed coalition agreements. Laws also predicted that there would be more consultation with MPs in any future coalition agreement: \u201cParty leaders negotiated on behalf of their entire parties and then told the parties afterwards more or less what had been done. There will be a higher expectation of engagement next time around.\u201d Responding to criticism over the rising cost of special advisers, Laws argued that they provide ministers with policy advice that has a \u201cnecessary political dimension\u201d, something that it is not easy for civil servants to provide. Laws dedicated considerable time to defending the model of coalition government, saying that those who said coalitions produced chaos had been proved \u201cutterly wrong\u201d. \u201cI would argue that this coalition government has been as effective as any single-party government in my lifetime and considerably more effective than most of the single-party governments in my lifetime,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
