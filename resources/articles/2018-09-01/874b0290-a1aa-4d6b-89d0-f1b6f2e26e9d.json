The Department for Exiting the European Union issued a defiant statement rejecting Johnson\u2019s alternative, laid out in a 4,000-word Telegraph article, saying it was \u201cnot a workable or negotiable plan,\u201d less that two days before the start of the Conservative party conference in Birmingham. Government sources mocked Johnson\u2019s disavowal of the December withdrawal agreement, when he had been part of the cabinet that approved it, dismissing his intervention as \u201canother very lengthy article which doesn\u2019t offer any answers\u201d. Speaking ahead of the conference, May said the government was on the verge of a Brexit deal, despite admitting after the EU summit in Salzburg that the two sides remained some distance apart on customs and the Northern Irish border. \u201cThe right deal is close \u2013 and with it the opportunity to make life better for ordinary working people,\u201d she said. But Johnson continued his public intervention with a series of television interviews \u2013 his first since quitting over Chequers \u2013 criticising the prime minister, warning May that she risked betraying the wishes of leave voters if she persisted with the Chequers deal but stopping short of calling her to go. Johnson told the BBC: \u201cIf you stick with Chequers, the electorate of this country will look at what we have produced and think how on Earth was that the outcome of voting leave.\u201d He was then asked if he would challenge for the leadership if he failed to persuade May to change course. \u201cMy job is to speak up for what I believe in and the vision that I\u2019ve set out today and I believe in it very, very sincerely. I\u2019m going to keep going for as long as it takes,\u201d he said. Johnson told Sky News he stood by what he had said in his previous columns when he compared fully veiled Muslim women to \u201cletter boxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d and said that people should read his articles in full. In his article on Friday, Johnson said May should renege on the December agreement, which included the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d, keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market in order to avoid a hard border. Johnson said the UK should instead pursue a \u201csuper Canada trade deal\u201d aiming for zero tariffs and quotas, with investment in new technology to ease customs at the border. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Brexit minister, hit back at Johnson on Friday evening, saying: \u201cThis is not a workable or negotiable plan for Brexit \u2013 as both sides have made clear on several occasions. No deal is available without a guarantee that there would be no hard border in Northern Ireland in any eventuality, the so-called Irish backstop.\u201d A government source also dismissed Johnson\u2019s criticism of the December agreement. \u201cBoris was a member of the cabinet that agreed the December joint report \u2013 and praised the PM for doing so \u2013 and was part of the committee that agreed the customs backstop,\u201d the source said. Johnson is set to attend a rally on the night before May\u2019s conference speech, an appearance likely to dominate any preview of her address. But the prime minister is understood to be determined that cabinet ministers put on a disciplined united front at the conference, which begins this weekend with a string of policy announcements planned. May said the conference theme was \u201copportunity\u201d and that the party would set out a vision for a post-Brexit Britain, after a fractious few days where senior Tories have publicly cast doubt on the party\u2019s message after Labour focused on on childcare, high street renewal and housing at its conference. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a crucial moment,\u201d May said. \u201cSo at this conference, we will be setting out how we will provide opportunity for all \u2013 a stronger, fairer country with real opportunity for people who work hard and do the right thing. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, considered to be a future leadership contender, intends to give teachers, police officers and other officials a new legal duty to take a \u201cpublic health\u201d approach to violent crime, supported by a \u00a3200m \u201cyouth endowment fund\u201d targeted at crime hotspots. Downing Street also announced May would back a bid to host the 2030 Fifa World Cup in the four nations of the UK and Ireland, saying the joint bid would be a \u201cstrong contender\u201d. May said the decision was spurred by the \u201cexcitement of this summer\u2019s World Cup\u201d when England reached the semi-finals in Russia. \u201cThe decision on whether to bid is, of course, for the football associations to make. But if they decide to go forward, they can count on this government\u2019s full support,\u201d she said. Any bid would face opposition from a joint campaign by Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, which has already launched a bid with their \u201cbelieve big\u201d slogan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
