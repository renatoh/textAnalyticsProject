The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils had little confidence that they would be able to deliver the already tough savings targets they had set themselves for this financial year, and would have to go back for extra cuts to meet their legal requirement to balance their budgets. A further one in three councils surveyed said prospects were so bleak that within three years they would be unable to meet their statutory obligation to provide an adequate service in core areas such as adult social care, child protection and homelessness prevention. Lord Porter, the LGA chairman and a Tory peer, said: \u201cAs this survey shows, if the government fails to adequately fund local government, there is a real risk to the future financial viability of some services and councils.\u201d The LGA, which holds its annual conference in Bournemouth on Tuesday, has called for urgent funding guarantees amid concerns that the government\u2019s three-year spending review planned for the autumn will be postponed because of uncertainty caused by the Tory leadership contest and the looming October Brexit deadline. Even if councils are given an emergency one-year \u201crollover\u201d financial settlement for 2020-21, this will lock austerity into town hall budgets for a 10th successive year, raising fears that a further round of cuts and redundancies will critically undermine the quality and safety of day-to-day services. Porter told MPs last month that vulnerable people would die as a result of social care cuts if the funding gap between resources and demand widened further, saying that \u201cthe first serious shock will be when a secretary of state has to stand up and explain to the public why those people died because the money was not available\u201d. He told the Commons housing, communities and local government committee: \u201cI am not sure anybody who gets elected to parliament wants to be the person who stands on the newsstand and explains why people died because of fiscal policy. It is only money, at the end of the day. Why do we need to lose people because of money?\u201d Last year Tory-run Northamptonshire county council in effect declared bankruptcy and imposed a ban on non-essential spending. Its failure to make planned savings after years of cutbacks and chaotic management left it unable to fulfil its legal requirement to meet its spending obligations and balance its budget. It reportedly stabilised its finances early this year after selling its headquarters and spending \u00a360m of the proceeds to balance the books. However, it has since reported a \u00a36m overspend on its adult social care budget, just three months into the new financial year. Councils have already had proposed cuts to statutory services such as libraries and Sure Start centres challenged \u2013 and sometimes overturned \u2013 in the courts on the grounds that the cuts breach the legal obligation to provide an adequate level of service. More judicial review challenges are expected. The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said community neglect was the legacy of a decade of municipal austerity. \u201cOur councils keep our streets cleaner and safer, protect the most vulnerable in society and maintain our green spaces \u2013 but a decade of austerity has eroded these vital services away.\u201d The LGA estimates that between 2010 and 2016, local authorities will have lost 60p out of every \u00a31 they received from central government. By next April the gap between council resources and demand will be \u00a33bn, rising to \u00a38bn by 2025, fuelled by wage inflation and the rising costs of adult and child social care. The LGA survey was completed by 141 out of 339 LGA member councils between 28 March and 5 June. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cCouncils are a vital link to meet the needs of residents. That\u2019s why we\u2019re providing local authorities with access to \u00a346.4bn this year \u2013 a real-terms increase \u2013 including extra funding to support some of our most vulnerable groups.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
