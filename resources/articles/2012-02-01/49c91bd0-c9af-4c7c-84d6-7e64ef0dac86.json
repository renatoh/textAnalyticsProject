The cold spell has already led to road accidents, with 100 reported in Cumbria yesterday alone, as rain fell on freezing roads and immediately turned to sheet ice. The A66 trans-Pennine route was closed after a number of lorries jack-knifed near Stainmore in Cumbria, and there were several collisions on the M6. On the other side of the Pennines, several people were trapped in a multiple-vehicle crash in Gateshead at the junction of the A194 and the A1; there were no reports of serious injuries. In another incident, five cars and a bus collided on the Felling bypass in Gateshead, with drivers suffering minor injuries and shock. Lancashire police warned motorists to drive slowly. Officers were called to 10 accidents between junctions 33 and 36 on both carriageways of the M6, though no injuries were reported. \"It is raining and the rain is turning into ice,\" a police spokesman said. \"However, motorists still insist on driving too fast and not to the conditions.\" Martin Young, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said last night that snow would continue to fall in some parts of the country into Friday. \"While there is uncertainty about where the heaviest snow will be, we expect a covering of 1cm to 5cm of snow in many areas and possibly up to 10cm in the worst affected regions of perhaps the Midlands and south-east Wales. As a result there could be some disruption to travel.\" The Met Office had earlier issued an amber warning of widespread ice for the north of England, with a yellow warning of snow and ice in many parts of England, Wales and Scotland. The worst affected areas are likely to be east Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and the east Midlands. There may be snow flurries in London this evening. The Met Office said rain had moved south into Wales and northern England: \"In places this rain is falling on to very cold surfaces, such as roads, and will freeze instantly, forming a layer of ice.\" It said An area of Snow is was expected to develop over east and north-east England, later on Thursday, it said"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
