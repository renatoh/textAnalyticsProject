Perhaps a man who is working outside and wearing a hard hat and overalls? But engineering is a lot more than that. Modern engineers work across a variety of sectors \u2013 from light and audio, to renewable energy, to building whole new cities. They also work around the country in different cities, as well as rural areas, working in everything from computer coding to chemical engineering; some even have jobs in fashion, creating wearable technology. The profession is still male- dominated, however; according to the Women in Engineering Society (WES), just 12% of the UK\u2019s engineers are women. But the number of women entering the profession has grown in recent years and many young women are thriving in the industry. We spoke to a range of young female engineers working in their first jobs to find out how they\u2019re getting on. Some said they enjoyed being able to express their creativity through engineering, while others felt they thrive on being part of projects that have a positive impact on the world. \u2018I used to be quite shy before, but I feel like I\u2019ve found confidence in myself through this role \u2019 Zeinab Mohammed, 21, assistant services engineer at Pick Everard I design things such as lighting \u2013 I like being able to use my creativity and put my mark on it. I\u2019m the youngest in the team and there\u2019s definitely a bit of an age gap because I\u2019m 21 and the second-youngest is 33. They never make me feel like I\u2019m asking a silly question, though. There\u2019s a lot of banter that goes on in the team. They joke around with me when they make a reference to old films that I haven\u2019t seen. But I joke around with them, too, because they don\u2019t always understand the lingo of the younger generation. It\u2019s a two-way thing and we laugh a lot. I was a shy person before I started at Pick Everard, but I\u2019ve found confidence in myself through this role. \u2018I fell in love with coding as soon as I typed my first line of code. I\u2019ve definitely found my passion\u2019 Jennifer Opal, 28, junior software engineer at BT Group I was at university in London, where I\u2019m from, studying business and French, but I dropped out to do this job. Code First: Girls visited my university and were offering free eight-week courses to give people an insight into coding and web design. From the first day, I fell in love with it. Once I typed my first line of code, it was like: \u201cWow, I really want to do this\u201d. I found my passion. Then I was offered this job. I felt like I\u2019d been given an opportunity to develop my skills and make an impact, and if it meant I had to leave university and leave London then I decided to take that chance. I have no regrets about leaving London to do this. \u2018My job has been really sociable, because 10 of us started together \u2013 we never feel alone\u2019 Lucy Allen, 23, graduate infrastructure engineer We build roads, drainage, and water supply. The projects I\u2019m working on are in the UK and overseas, in places such as the Middle East. The scale varies from one building to building whole new cities, where there\u2019s no infrastructure, so we\u2019re designing how to get water in, how to get rid of waste, and all the road networks. It\u2019s really exciting, but also quite overwhelming at times. My job has been really sociable, because 10 of us started together in the past year \u2013 so we never feel alone. The company organises social events for graduate engineers, such as softball matches against the architects, which really helps us bond and get to know each other better. \u2018I was intimidated at first, but there\u2019s a relaxed atmosphere and everyone\u2019s really supportive\u2019 Priya Nirmal, 23, associate digital engineer at Capco I\u2019m a developer, so I work on websites and apps. I went into engineering for the creativity \u2013 you\u2019re constantly making and designing things, which is my passion. I\u2019ve always liked to be artistic and can show that through engineering. I was intimidated when I first started, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect, but there\u2019s a relaxed atmosphere and people have been really supportive and welcoming. There\u2019s a lot of things I can explore here. I\u2019ve learned so much in five months and it doesn\u2019t feel like my education has ended yet \u2013 I\u2019m still learning every day. Learning is part of the job, which means you\u2019re never bored. \u2018We\u2019ve even worked with the Golden Globe awards \u2013 we made a special trophy for them\u2019 Olivia Ojuorye, 25, electronic engineer and product manager at Digiseq We work with fashion brands to create wearable technology \u2013 such as watches, bracelets or rings \u2013 and we insert chips so you can use them to make contactless payment devices. It\u2019s a really interesting sector of engineering, where fashion and wearable technology combines. We also worked with the Golden Globe awards. I don\u2019t think many people know this, but the 2019 trophies have a chip inside. We put that there so in the future you can know it\u2019s a real trophy and not a fake. Technology is being embraced and that\u2019s great for engineering, because it encourages people to enter, and that means more diversity. \u2018One career highlight was doing a site tour with Jeremy Corbyn, where he met the new engineers\u2019 Elizabeth Elliot, 29, civil engineer on the graduate scheme at Bombardier My company makes trains and rolling stock \u2013 for example, we\u2019re doing the Crossrail trains. We make sure the trains work and that they last. I fell into recruitment when I graduated and was recruiting engineers for Bombardier, where I work now. But recruitment wasn\u2019t scratching the itch for me any more and I wanted to be in a technical position. Bombardier was looking for someone for their graduate scheme and I thought: \u2018This is my chance\u2019. One of the highlights was doing a site tour with Jeremy Corbyn. He got to go on one of the trains and met us because we\u2019re a new generation of engineers. \u2018As a woman, I\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019ve been given equal opportunities in engineering\u2019 Kulsum Ahmed, 27, safety and risk consultant at Environmental Resources Management My job is to look for ways to prevent potential oil and gas hazards. It\u2019s nice to use my engineering degree in a way that protects people and the environment. Every day is completely different and I get the opportunity to work with a large variety of clients. The first time I went to a client workshop, though, I was so nervous I spilt a cup of tea all over my manager\u2019s laptop. I had to turn it upside down and sit with it that way for the rest of the day, but it was fine in the end. I\u2019ve been very lucky. I\u2019ve never felt like an outcast as a woman in engineering. I\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019ve been given equal opportunities. Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)"}, "isHosted": false}}}
