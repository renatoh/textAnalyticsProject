A reporter on Friday questioned a claim by the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired four-star marine general, that the Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson had taken credit for securing funding for an FBI building in Florida. Chip Reid, a CBS News correspondent, said during the daily press briefing: \u201cHe was wrong yesterday in talking about getting the money. The money was secured before she came into Congress.\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, replied coldly: \u201cIf you want to go after Gen Kelly, that\u2019s up to you. But I think that if you want to get into a debate with a four-star marine general, I think that that\u2019s something highly inappropriate.\u201d Reid\u2019s follow-up question was ignored and the implication \u2013 from a democratically elected civilian government \u2013 that a military general was beyond criticism was troubling to many. Perry O\u2019Brien, a former army medic who served in Afghanistan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just another example of the administration hiding behind the uniform of others. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so unfortunate to see someone like Gen Kelly enable that and jump on the grenade that Trump threw.\u201d O\u2019Brien, organising director of Common Defense, a group of veterans against Trump, added: \u201cWhen you say, \u2018How dare you criticise a general?\u2019, how about [former Trump national security adviser] Gen Michael Flynn, who was the first to resign after we learned they were colluding with foreign powers? I don\u2019t think most generals would say a star on your shoulder makes you immune from criticism.\u201d Kelly appeared at the White House podium on Thursday, to defend Trump against the charge that he caused offence during a call with the widow of Sgt La David Johnson, one of four US soldiers killed in Niger earlier this month by Islamic State fighters. Wilson heard the call and criticised Trump for disrespecting Johnson\u2019s widow, Myeshia. While defending the president, Kelly \u2013 whose son Robert was killed in Afghanistan in 2010 \u2013 accused Wilson of \u201cgrandstanding\u201d in a 2015 speech by saying she was instrumental in getting funding for an FBI building in Florida and took care of her constituents because she got the money. Wilson denied the charge and video evidence appeared to support her account. Kelly stood by his accusation, Sanders said on Friday. \u201cGen Kelly said he was stunned that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honouring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former president Obama on legislation,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Gen Kelly pointed out, if you\u2019re able to make a sacred act like honouring American heroes all about yourself, you\u2019re an \u2018empty barrel\u2019. If you don\u2019t understand that reference, I\u2019ll put it a little more simply. As we say in the south: all hat, no cattle.\u201d Wilson regularly wears a cowboy hat. Challenged over the video footage of the speech, in which Wilson praises FBI agents, Sanders insisted: \u201cShe also had quite a few comments that day that weren\u2019t part of that speech and weren\u2019t part of that video that were also witnessed by many people that were there.\u201d The press secretary also rejected criticism from Johnson\u2019s mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, who supports the accounts of the Trump phone call given by her son\u2019s widow and Wilson. \u201cCertainly, if the spirit of which those comments were intended were misunderstood, that\u2019s very unfortunate,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut as the president has said, as Gen Kelly said \u2013 who I think has a very deep understanding of what that individual would be going through \u2013 his comments were very sympathetic, very respectful. And that was the spirit in which the president intended them. If they were taken any other way, that\u2019s certainly an unfortunate thing.\u201d According to Wilson, Trump told Johnson\u2019s widow her late husband \u201cknew what he signed up for, but when it happens it hurts anyway\u201d. Kelly in effect corroborated that account, saying he had counseled Trump on how to make the call by telling him of the morning he was told of his son\u2019s death. Kelly recalled his close friend, Gen Joseph Dunford, telling him his son \u201cwas doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed\u201d. \u201cHe knew what the possibilities were, because we\u2019re at war,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the president tried to say to the four families the other day.\u201d Trump, however, continues to vehemently deny that he said such words. \u201cThe fake news is going crazy with wacky congresswoman Wilson [Democrat] who was secretly on a very personal call and gave a total lie on content,\u201d he tweeted late on Thursday. Kelly also suggested Wilson had eavesdropped on a highly sensitive call. The congresswoman, a close friend of the Johnson family, pointed out she was in the car when Myeshia Johnson received the call, which was placed on speakerphone. \u201cI wasn\u2019t listening in,\u201d she told CNN on Friday. \u201cPlease don\u2019t characterize it as that.\u201d Wilson said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cnot a good message to say to anyone who has lost a child at war\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t sign up because you think you\u2019re going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cYou sign up to serve your country. There\u2019s nothing to misinterpret. He said what he said. I just don\u2019t agree with it. I just don\u2019t agree with that\u2019s what you should say to grieving families.\u201d Regarding Kelly\u2019s remarks about the FBI field office speech, Wilson said she had not been a member of Congress in 2009, when the funding mentioned by Kelly was secured. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d she said of Kelly\u2019s characterization. \u201cHow dare he?\u201d She added: \u201cI feel sorry for Gen Kelly. He has my sympathy for the loss of his son. But he can\u2019t just go on TV and lie on me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
