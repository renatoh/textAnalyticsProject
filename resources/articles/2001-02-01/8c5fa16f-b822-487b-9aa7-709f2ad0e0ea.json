Bradford's slide back to the Nationwide League gathered momentum with another defeat, their sixteenth of the season, which leaves them 11 points behind fourth-from-bottom Middlesbrough at the foot of the table. With 12 games to go, only the bold or the foolish would predict survival, so Jefferies has little to lose by taking his players away in a bid to shake off their midwinter gloom. 'We haven't been able to train properly because of the weather, so we're taking them to Portugal to train on better surfaces and hopefully the break will do us some good. 'The players are desperate to get out of this position and until survival is impossible we will keep going. You never know what might happen - a couple of wins could turn things around, but it is going to be difficult. 'Our league position doesn't lie - basically we are not good enough.' To be fair to Jefferies, however, his team looked no worse than Southampton for most of this poor game, apart from a brief spell midway through the second half, when two goals in the space of three minutes from Marian Pahars and James Beattie secured victory. Pahars broke the deadlock - and the tedium - in the 60th minute when he headed Jo Tessem's right-wing cross into the far corner of the goal, his first strike since last September. The little Latvian then set up former Bradford midfielder Dan Petrescu to fire in a low cross from the left that Beattie flicked into the net with what Hoddle described as a 'training-ground finish'. It was Beattie's twelfth goal of the season after his long barren spell was broken back in November. 'He's getting better and better,' said Hoddle, 'and his all-round game is improving all the time.' Pahars, by contrast, was out of form and confidence before his goal and Hoddle added: 'He had a long lean spell and I would have rested him if it hadn't been for injuries and suspensions, but we stuck with him and he came up trumps.' Bradford's strikers have been having an even leaner time, with Dean Saunders goalless since last February. Jefferies must hope a few days in the sun can change things. Some hope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
