The German mark, the Italian lira and the Spanish pesata are among the currencies being scrapped tonight. Other currencies to be axed are the Greek drachma, the Austrian schilling, the Belgian franc, the Portuguese escudo and the Luxembourg franc. The other eurozone countries, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands have already completed the swap. Euro coins and notes became legal tender on January 1, and have been used alongside the existing currencies for a limited period. Today there were muted reactions to the loss of historic national currencies. In Greece, where the drachma was first minted in 650BC, and revived in the 1830s, people appeared unsentimental about its exit, marking its passing with a quiet reception in central Athens. \"I wouldn't say I was sorry,\" said Anna Diamantopoulou, the Greek EU commissioner for employment and social affairs. \"We have a historic bond with the drachma and we will always remember it. But I am happier that the euro has arrived.\" But the deutschmark has a deeper resonance in the German psyche, becoming a symbol of international acceptance, rebuilding and prosperity in the postwar years. \"The date the mark was born, June 21 1948, is still etched in the minds of older Germans,\" Jonathan Williams, a monetary historian at the British Museum, told the Observer last week. The changeover has been deemed a success. A eurozone-wide survey carried out by the European Central Bank showed that 87% of people had experienced a smooth changeover and 70% of people were in favour of the single currency. Although the eight currencies will cease to be legal tender from midnight, an estimated 42bn euros (\u00a325.7bn) worth of defunct coins and notes have yet to be returned to banks. A good deal may never resurface, having been stashed by collectors, lost down the backs of sofas of simply forgotten. But European banks will be obliged to exchange old currencies for many years to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
