The coach has selected 11 fresh faces in his squad of 23. Seventy years ago, England fielded 14 because they had to. It was their first Test since the hiatus in international rugby that was the Second World War. This time the circumstances are only slightly less compelling. Jones has precious little choice with 30 players unavailable for this first Test, of two, in the city of San Juan, 1,000km inland from Buenos Aires, wedged up against the Andes and Chile beyond. It is not the All Blacks at Eden Park, but Argentina in Argentina is about as intense a furnace in which to forge new players as Jones could have chosen. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the greatest challenges in world rugby,\u201d he said with the grin that assures he is delighted with the situation. \u201cEveryone is nice to you and everyone smiles, \u2018yes sir, what would you like sir?\u2019 And then comes the game. Bang. It\u2019s on. That\u2019s the difference here.\u201d Tom Curry is the headline selection, the Sale flanker set to become England\u2019s youngest debutant \u2013 at just shy of 19 \u2013 since Jonny Wilkinson was introduced in 1998, a couple of months before Curry was born. Wilkinson came on as a winger for the last few minutes of a comfortable win against Ireland; Curry is going to have to mix it from the start with a pack of Pumas. He\u2019s England\u2019s youngest starter for 90 years. The reception on the pitch will be ferocious, as will the backdrop. The Estadio San Juan de Bicentenario is a sell-out, and the locals, whatever the sport, do not enter an arena anything less than well up for it. \u201cWhen we come to these provinces the people are fanatics,\u201d says Martin Landajo, the Argentina scrum-half. \u201cThe Argentinian crowd is like a football crowd. They will insult you, shout offensive things. It is not the same as England where you have the people sitting together and nothing happens. If you are a bit cheeky they may do something to you.\u201d Fortunately, Curry, whose identical twin, Ben, is also on tour, seems a well brought-up fellow. At the other end of the experience spectrum, Dylan Hartley, on 84 caps, is sharing with him. He describes Curry as a studious room-mate who does his stretches every day and rings his mum. Such conscientiousness will have to be enhanced on Saturday by something more elemental, but Jones and Hartley have great faith in their young charges. The opposition are more of a known quantity than England\u2019s thrown-together XV, which includes three other new caps in Harry Williams, Mark Wilson and Alex Lozowski. Another five have fewer than a dozen caps each. Argentina boast 528, spread more evenly throughout their XV than England\u2019s 345, 215 of which are shared between Hartley, Danny Care and Mike Brown. The Pumas\u2019 squad is entirely taken from the Jaguares, Argentina\u2019s sole team in Super Rugby. They are the only other international side whose selection policy is as strict as the All Blacks\u2019, so some of their best players are ineligible. The Jaguares have graced the Super 18 with some fabulous play but a consistent winning formula remains elusive. In this, their second season, they won four of their first five matches, then lost six of the next seven. For now, the nascent arrangement between the Jaguares and Pumas is clearly unsatisfactory, the two sides essentially the same, but it has introduced the players to the rigours of regular professionalism. \u201cIn the future it will help us,\u201d says Landajo. He expects the dynamic of international rugby to galvanise the Pumas. \u201cJaguares is more like a job; this is our passion.\u201d Jones considers this the perfect challenge by which to test his youngsters, even if he knows patience will be required. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect them to be world beaters on their first start. It is a process. I remember giving Matt Giteau his debut [for Australia]. He was terrible. He dropped the first ball, threw two bounce passes and was absolute rubbish. Second Test he was a little bit better and then his career blossomed.\u201d Words of assurance, perhaps, for Lozowski, who starts at inside centre. But for Williams, who makes his debut via a colourful route that took in a degree in English and sports science, a healthy social life, a stint as a pro with Jersey before winding up as a Premiership champion with Exeter last month, and his fellow prop, Ellis Genge, on one cap, the proposition is more brutal. Jones, enjoying a similarly healthy social life, took a trip to Argentina when he was a teenager himself in 1979. \u201cI remember the Australian scrum getting pushed back. You could see the tractor marks in the ground. That was when the bajada was at its peak.\u201d The bajada is the scrummaging technique around which Argentina built their first great side in the 70s and 80s. It was belligerent, focused and unrelenting. Few could deal with it. We live in more enlightened times now, wherein Pumas are seen running with the ball, but that primal threat remains integral to Argentinian rugby. For rugby boys, Argentina in Argentina is an initiation ceremony without equal. England\u2019s mission is to emerge from Saturday\u2019s inferno with a few more fully formed men."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
