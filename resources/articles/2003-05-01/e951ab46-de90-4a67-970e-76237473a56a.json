Among them is the England prop David Flatman, who is leaving Saracens at the end of the season but has not returned the signed contract committing him to the West Country club. The Leicester back-row forward Peter Short, also earmarked to boost Bath's fortunes, has been reviewing his options and is set to join the French club Narbonne. Even Duncan Bell, the English-qualified prop who has already signed from Pontypridd, is seeking clarification regarding his position on the eve of the relegation-threatened club's final league game at home to Newcastle tomorrow. Club sources are also fearful that, even if Bath escape the drop, recruitment will be next to impossible while feverish speculation continues about a merger with Bristol. One of the main reasons why Bath have struggled this season is their failure to land key players last summer, when the former Australia forward Mark Connors, Argentinian prop Rodrigo Roncero and Bell all ended up at other clubs despite initial indications they may move to Bath. Existing Bath players, meanwhile, have been told their contracts will be honoured if the merger with Bristol goes ahead and the club remains in the Premiership, but co-coach Michael Foley has warned they must expect to go down if they fail to beat the Falcons. \"My belief is that if we lose this weekend we will be relegated,\" Foley said yesterday. \"The very simple message is we need to win. There's been plenty of challenges this year but none as great as this.\" Foley, who says he would be willing to stay with the club \"if they want me\" should they be relegated, hopes that the England centre Mike Catt, troubled by hamstring problems, will be able to play if he comes through today's final training run. \"He finished the session yesterday and everyone held their breath but he walked away fine,\" Foley said. Oxford United's chairman Firoz Kassam, meanwhile, claimed last night that a deal has been \"agreed in principle\" with the Bristol owner Malcolm Pearce that will see Bristol move to Oxford next season, providing they avoid relegation. However, Kassam claims he no longer knows where he stands, following revelations that Bristol could be set for a merger with Bath during the close season. \"The only person who can really tell you is Malcolm Pearce,\" Kassam told BBC Radio Bristol. \"As far as I am concerned, we had discussed and agreed a deal in principle some weeks ago. The only condition, as far as I was aware, was that as long as Bristol stayed in the Premiership we had a deal. On Saturday we will know where they are. If they are still in the Premiership then I believe we have a deal agreed.\" Harlequins have signed the Tonga full-back Josh Taumalolo from Bridgend and Newport's prop Ceri Jones, on loan at the Stoop since Christmas, has signed a permanent deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
