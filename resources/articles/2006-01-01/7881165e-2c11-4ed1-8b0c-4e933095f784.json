CNN apologised after misquoting the country's president during a live broadcast, reporting him as saying \"the use of nuclear weapons is Iran's right\". In fact, the broadcaster said today, Mr Ahmadinejad had referred to \"nuclear energy\". \"Due to an error in translation, CNN incorrectly quoted Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in his speech given on Saturday, as saying that Iran has the right to build nuclear weapons. In fact, President Ahmadinejad said Iran has the right to nuclear energy, and that 'a nation that has civilisation does not need nuclear weapons,' and 'our nation does not need them'. CNN takes this matter very serious and apologises for the error,\" the broadcaster said. CNN said it had apologised to the Iranian government as well as running corrections on air. But according to reports, the Iranian authorities have now banned CNN and expelled its reporter from the country. \"Taking into account CNN's actions contrary to professional ethics in the past years and their distortion of the president's comments during his press conference on Saturday, the activities of the CNN journalist in Tehran will end and no journalists from CNN will be authorised to come to Iran,\" according to a statement from the Iranian culture ministry, quoted by news agency AFP. The president made his comment at a press conference on Saturday attended by around 200 people. Since then, CNN said it had issued corrections wherever the original report was aired. The broadcaster said today it was \"disappointed\" by Iran's reaction. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
