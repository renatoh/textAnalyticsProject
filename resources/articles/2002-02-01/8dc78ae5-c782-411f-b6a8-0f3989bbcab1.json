The temporary move to their west London neighbours Queens Park Rangers, while a new \u00a370m, 30,000 all-seat stadium is built by the Thames, was announced yesterday. Although it will cost a seven-figure sum in rent, money seems no object at Fulham these days. Their chairman and benefactor Mohamed Al Fayed is even understood to have bought up three houses whose light will be restricted by the new ground. Fulham will play all next season's home games at Loftus Road, which has a capacity of 19,148, about 2,000 short of the highest crowd at Craven Cottage this season. The team's final competitive game at the old ground - which still has terracing and banks of wooden seating - will be the Premiership clash with Leicester on April 27. The proposed ground-share is expected to be rubber-stamped at the next Premier League board meeting on Feburary 18. Fulham's move marks an incredible turnaround in their fortunes. Fifteen years ago the owners of the then troubled club were planning to merge it with QPR, sell off Craven Cottage for housing and play at Loftus Road. Now the circumstances have come full circle since fan protests finally blocked the idea of Fulham Park Rangers in 1987. Fulham were then in the old Third Division and QPR in the top flight. Fulham are now among the elite; QPR are up for sale, recently relegated to the Second Division and just happy to pocket the estimated \u00a31m rent and hope it will help attract a buyer. Al Fayed stressed the need to play close to Craven Cottage, rather than force fans to trek across the capital to West Ham's Upton Park, which was the other ground-sharing option. \"I'm delighted we have now secured a temporary home within the borough,\" he said. \"I'm personally very pleased we are able to offer to help QPR through what is a very difficult time in the club's history. \"The survival of local clubs steeped in tradition is of paramount importance to me. We will be working hard with our supporters and other parties during the coming months to ensure a smooth transition.\" The chief executive of Loftus Road plc David Davies added: \"The deal will bring much-needed revenue into the company. It will also make QPR a more attractive proposition to a potential buyer.\" The rugby union side Wasps have agreed to move out of Loftus Road to make way for Fulham, after sharing the ground for five years. Their exit has been sweetened by a reported \u00a3300,000 pay-off as they consider various options, including moving in with Wycombe Wanderers or with another rugby union club, Harlequins. Wimbledon's chairman Charles Koppel has upped the PR ante in the battle over the proposed move to Milton Keynes. He now claims the only alternative is: \"The club locks the door, throws away the key and ceases to exist.\" But Wimbledon fans continue to insist a move back to Plough Lane is feasible. Merton council is even putting together a consortium to build its own stadium on the site. The Football League is currently reviewing its decision to block the move to Milton Keynes after an FA arbitration panel ruling. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
