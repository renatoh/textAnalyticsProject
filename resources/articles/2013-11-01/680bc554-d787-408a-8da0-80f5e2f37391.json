The Herald reported on its website that Jim Wyss was released from a detention facility in Caracas and handed over to US embassy officials. The newspaper's executive editor, Aminda Marques Gonzalez, said on the website: \"Jim is safe and soon will be reunited with his loved ones.\" Wyss later sent a message on Twitter thanking the Herald and others who worked to secure his speedy release. From the immigration detention center in Caracas, he joked about the diet of ham sandwiches he was fed and the tight living conditions in the room he was held with eight other people. \"It's like living in a bar with bunkbeds,\" he told the Herald. Wyss, the Herald's Bogota-based Andean bureau chief, had been reporting near the Colombian border on Venezuela's \"chronic shortages and looming municipal elections\" when he was detained, the newspaper said in a story published on its web site. The story said Wyss was detained by the National Guard then transferred to a military intelligence post in San Cristobal, close to the frontier, and then moved to the capital, Caracas, 500 miles away. On Saturday morning the Herald reported that its world editor, John Yearwood, had flown to Caracas to usher Wyss out of the country and that US embassy officials in the Venezuelan capital were also involved. Nicolas Maduro was elected as Venezuela's president in April, following the death of Hugo Chavez. He has repeatedly claimed that the US is trying to destabilise his regime and has expelled several American diplomats this year for alleged conspiracy. In September he claimed that he cancelled a trip to New York because former US government officials were plotting to kill him. As well as strained foreign relations, Maduro is facing acute domestic economic problems, including shortages of key goods and an annual inflation rate of more than 54%. On Saturday, Reuters reported that Maduro had ordered the military \"occupation\" of a chain of electronic goods stores. Various managers of the five-store, 500-employee Daka chain were arrested, the report said, adding that Maduro said late on Friday that the company would now be forced to sell products at \"fair prices\". Soldiers guarded the stores and on Saturday morning hundreds of bargain-hunters flocked to Daka shops. \"We're doing this for the good of the nation,\" said Maduro. \"I've ordered the immediate occupation of this chain to offer its products to the people at fair prices, everything. Let nothing remain in stock \u2026 We're going to comb the whole nation in the next few days. This robbery of the people has to stop.\" Wyss is not the first American journalist to be held in Venezuela this year. A US filmmaker, Timothy Tracy, was arrested at Caracas airport in April, as he was attempting to leave the country. He was accused of espionage and backing Maduro's opponents. Tracy was released and expelled from Venezuela in June. The Herald reported that immigration authorities tried to stop Wyss entering the country shortly before Chavez's death was announced. Press freedom advocacy groups have repeatedly accused Maduro's regime of repressive and intimidatory tactics towards journalists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
