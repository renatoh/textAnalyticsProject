The period led to inspired bouts of experimentation (she soundtracked a sci-fi film) as well as patience-testing indulgences (a 21-minute antiwar song on her 1973 album Where Are You Now, My Son?). Diamonds and Rust was the crowning achievement of her imperial period and one of the best singer-songwriter albums of the 70s. The crystalline voice that had made Baez the first lady of folk-rock had weathered into a warmer tone, and a kaleidoscope of genres including rock, jazz and soul added new colours to her maturing Washington Square sound. A stately take on Stevie Wonder\u2019s ballad I Never Dreamed You\u2019d Leave in Summer evokes the closing credits of a prestige weepie, while on the freewheeling Joni Mitchell duet Dida, the two singers\u2019 voices swoop like swallows at dusk. Baez had butted heads with the 60s women\u2019s movement, particularly for appearing on a cheeky anti-Vietnam conscription poster that stated: \u201cGIRLS SAY YES to boys who say NO.\u201d But Diamonds and Rust platforms women\u2019s stories in its own way. Children and All That Jazz is a collaboration with the jazz virtuoso Hampton Hawes where Baez\u2019s stream-of-consciousness lyrics describe the mindset of a frazzled mother \u2013 a perspective rarely made space for in \u201cserious\u201d art \u2013 her vocals doing soprano trapeze-work among the flurries of instrumentation. She is also unafraid to skewer the mythos of the scene that made her. The album\u2019s title track is Baez\u2019s greatest song, a clear-eyed postmortem of her romantic relationship with Bob Dylan that details rapturous highs and a novel\u2019s worth of small cruelties. \u201cAs I remember your eyes were bluer than robin\u2019s eggs / My poetry was lousy, you said,\u201d she sings, her voice curdling. There\u2019s more than a hint of that bruised sentiment in the \u201cman child\u201d poet Lana Del Rey described on Norman Fucking Rockwell, an artistic synergy confirmed by Del Rey and Baez\u2019s exquisite live performance of Diamonds and Rust last year. The three albums to listen to next Joan Baez/5 (1964) There\u2019s a strange, theremin-like purity to Baez\u2019s singing voice in the traditional songs of her 1960 self-titled album that has led many critics to name it the best of her output that decade. Yet her outlaw taste and versatile abilities are more visible on Joan Baez/5, which includes singular takes on songs written by Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan, as well as a cut-glass cover of protest singer Phil Ochs\u2019 There But for Fortune (it was Baez\u2019s first UK Top 10 hit). Her embrace of global genres from Brazilian baroque to 18th-century English folk deeply intuitive here, while her version of Dylan\u2019s It Ain\u2019t Me Babe is sung as both a lament and a warning, perhaps as a sign of the couple\u2019s souring relationship. Baez was beginning to show her teeth. Come From the Shadows (1972) While Baez was a force in the 60s anti-war movement and a civil rights advocate, politics hit her closer to home in 1969 when her husband, the anti-war journalist David Harris, was jailed for draft evasion. The resulting album, Come From the Shadows, had Americana flourishes, a folk soul, and was unambiguously in conversation with 70s rock. In the Quiet Morning is an ecstatic elegy for Janis Joplin, the stately piano of Rainbow Road recalls classic Elton John, while To Bobby calls out Bob Dylan for his lapsed activism (he was unamused). Most stunningly, Baez is reinvented as a country empath in Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose), recruiting a cast of Nashville musicians in a call-out of police brutality and the inhuman treatment of undocumented immigrants, climaxing in a grave call to action: \u201cHelp us raze the prisons to the ground.\u201d Whistle Down the Wind (2018) With a deeper vocal range and steely point of view, Baez\u2019s 25th and (supposedly) final album is a late-period victory lap with eyes firmly on the here-and-now. These 10 covers span genres and epochs, peaking with the moving title track, a Tom Waits cover on which Baez sings of a life misspent in husky, mournful tones. She also updates an Anohni ballad for today\u2019s climate emergency, while a cover of Zoe Mulford\u2019s The President Sang Amazing Grace, a song about the in 2015, is a masterclass of teeth-gritted grace. Baez\u2019s fundamental optimism is intact even as she surveys the wreckage of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s the bitter end we\u2019ve come down to,\u201d she sings over uplifting piano. \u201cThe eye of the needle that we gotta get through.\u201d One for the heads The Altar Boy and the Thief (from Blowin\u2019 Away, 1977) In the late 70s, Baez was an outspoken opponent of the Briggs initiative, a cruel proposal to ban gay and lesbian people from working in California schools. Her LGBTQ+ allyship was vividly brought to life in The Altar Boy and the Thief, a spare piano ballad from 1977\u2019s Blowin\u2019 Away. Inspired by the Pink Elephant, her local Santa Monica gay nightspot, Baez immortalises the bar\u2019s open cruising and queens with \u201cfinely plucked eyebrows and skin of satin\u201d in a cry for the rights of queer+ communities to live \u201cunshamed\u201d. It\u2019s still hard to listen to without getting a lump in the throat.

Further reading And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir, by Joan Baez (1987) Baez\u2019s autobiography is wry, witty and refreshingly candid on clashes with Dylan and within her marriage, her commercial flops, and the unglamorous realities of activist life. Joan Baez\u2019s Fighting Side, by David Browne, Rolling Stone (2017) Baez is in puckish spirits in this evocative and funny profile, holding forth on dating Steve Jobs in the 1980s, blaming a bad album cover on her quaaludes phase and showing off her new bling. Joan Baez/5: Sleeve notes, by Langston Hughes (1964) Hughes\u2019s essay on Baez is as brilliant as you\u2019d expect from the Harlem renaissance legend. It\u2019s part autobiography, part poetic interpretations of her music. \u201cWhen she is singing, so uniquely \u2013 she becomes the song \u2013 and it is hers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd therefore artlessly, art.\u201d \u2022 What is your favourite Joan Baez recording?
