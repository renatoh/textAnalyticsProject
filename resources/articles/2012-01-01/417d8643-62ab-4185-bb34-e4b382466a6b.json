The North American international auto show, which opened to the press on Monday in Detroit, looks set to be the biggest motor show in years. All the major manufacturers are back, with Nissan rejoining its rivals after a three-year absence as the industry courts an increasingly confident US consumer. The show is far glitzier than it has been in recent years. Last year, Ford held its press conference on the showroom floor; this year, it announced its largest ever product launch inside a mini-stadium. \"It's really a fabulous time for everybody associated with Ford,\" said chief executive Alan Mulally. Ford and the other two big Detroit carmakers, Chrysler and General Motors, all logged double-digit sales growth last year, helping to fuel a 10.3% increase in the US sales to 12.8m vehicles, the highest since 2008. Both Chrysler and GM had to be bailed out by US taxpayers at the height of the recession. Unveiling Chrysler's Dodge Dart, Reid Bigland, head of Dodge, head of Dodge brand, said: \"We are thoroughly thankful for the second chance we have been given. We have been through hell and we don't need to go back.\" While the industry seems more confident than it has been in years, there is also a noticeable change in style. Fuel economy is hip. The Dart is a compact car with flair, owing its roots to the Alfa Romeo Giulietta. (The Italian carmaker Fiat, which is Alfa's parent company, holds a controlling interest in Chrysler.) Some versions will get 40 miles per gallon. Back in the recessionary 1970s, the Dart was one of Chrysler's bestselling cars and the company hopes it will hit the target again with today's cautious consumer. At Ford's glitzy press conference, Mulally concentrated much of his talk on the number of fuel-efficient technologies the car firm is launching, among them a plug-in electric hybrid version of its bestselling Fusion, sold as the Mondeo. Ford plans to triple production of hybrids and electric vehicles to more than 100,000 in 2013, rolling out five battery-powered offerings. Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at auto industry expert Edmunds.com, said: \"The atmosphere is so different to recent shows. It's like we are getting back to the old days. Car sales were good last year and they ended the year strongly. I think there is a renewed sense of confidence.\" But the industry had changed, she said. Fuel economy had never been an issue before the recession, she said. \"Now everyone is talking about it. It doesn't matter what segment you are in, it always gets mentioned. The consumer has changed \u2013 those mpg numbers matter now, they've seen what happens when gas prices rise.\" This year's Detroit motor show has also seen a return to luxury. On Sunday night people paid $500 (\u00a3320) a ticket to see 28 of the world's most expensive cars in a pre-show presentation which included a $2m Aston Martin One-77 and a McLaren MP4-12C. But even in the luxury end of the market, fuel economy is in. BMW, Lexus and Mercedes added hybrids to their ranges, too. Detroit may be back in business, but it's not business as usual."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
