But while a quarter of the faces in the 2015 parliament are new, and some of their stories are certainly extraordinary, the Commons chamber will look familiar to many. A profile of parliament by the Smith Institute, entitled Who Governs Britain?, finds a stubborn tendency for MPs to be \u201cmale, pale and stale\u201d, as the saying goes. The average MP is still a man, aged 51 (as has been the case since 1992), and, somewhat predictably, is most likely to have previously worked in politics. A third of MPs went to fee-paying private schools (compared with the national average of about 7%). Among Conservatives, 52% attended private schools, while that figure comes down to 12% among Labour MPs. Those results are similar to those of 2010. A quarter of MPs also have an occupational background in politics, highlighting the growing professionalisation of politics, a trend that many suggest has left MPs isolated from the priorities of the wider electorate. The general background of MPs continues to be ever more biased toward business and the \u201cmetropolitan professions\u201d, particularly finance, law, public affairs and politics. Indeed, only 3% had a background in manual work before being elected, as compared with 11% from public relations and 10% from the media. However, there are major disparities between the parties. Only 4% of Labour MPs have at some point worked in finance, as compared with 25% for the Conservatives. An alternative trend emerges among those who have come from the public and voluntary sector, which is dominated by Labour MPs. As might be expected, most of those who previously had blue-collar and trade union occupations represent Labour. Paul Hackett, director of the Smith Institute, an independent thinktank, said: \u201cOur study puts a question mark over how representative our parliament is. With a third of all MPs going to private schools and nearly a quarter from Oxbridge, it\u2019s no wonder the public feel our national politicians are out of touch.\u201d Those from the richest fifth of neighbourhoods are still nine times more likely to go to the top universities than those from the poorest fifth, according to the Sutton Trust, a charity established to improve social mobility. There is, however, some hope that things are changing. It was a good night all round for ethnic minority MPs on Thursday, with 41 entering parliament, up from 27 in 2010. Of the 2010 intake, 25 retained their seats and were joined by 16 newcomers (eight for Labour, seven for the Tories, and one with the SNP). And the gender balance is improving, albeit slowly. In 1987 women made up 6% of MPs. The proportion shot up as a consequence of Labour\u2019s 1997 landslide, when Tony Blair\u2019s party increased its number of female MPs (cringingly called the \u201cBlair babes\u201d) by 173%. On the back of such momentum, the proportion of females elected in 2010 was 22% and on Thursday it increased to 29%. Labour is ahead on this with 41%, followed by the SNP with 36%, and then the Conservatives with only one in five. The Liberal Democrats no longer have a single woman representative among their eight remaining MPs. The improvement, where it exists, may be a result of some initiatives by the speaker, John Bercow. Among those has been a \u201czero-tolerance response to unprofessional behaviour\u201d in the chamber, including bullying. In March Labour MP Emily Thornberry told the Observer that \u201ca lot of women here find it really quite shocking, the sort of environment, the level of personal competition and aggressiveness\u201d. However, Dr Lee Elliot Major, chief executive of the Sutton Trust, said more had to be done. \u201cIf parliament is truly to represent the whole nation, the best people should be able to become MPs,\u201d he said. Among the new MPs Andrea Jenkyns (Con) Morley and Outwood In her victory speech on defeating shadow chancellor Ed Balls, Jenkyns referred to the tragic death of her father, saying the reason she stood for parliament was to boost the NHS in memory of him. Clifford Jenkyns, a lorry driver, went into hospital in July 2011, aged 73, for a cancer operation that it was hoped would give him another 10 years of life. But while awaiting surgery at Pinderfields hospital in Wakefield, he contracted MRSA and died. On being elected, Jenkyns said she had given up her job, sold her house and moved in with her mother so she could afford to be a full-time politician. Jenkyns\u2019s website describes her as a soprano singer and businesswoman. \u201cShe met the prime minister of Pakistan, and performed in Islamabad to thousands of people,\u201d it says. \u201cThe music video for her song The Beach has been played in Asia and became one of the most requested songs on one of their television shows.\u201d Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh (SNP) Ochil and South Perthshire Ahmed-Sheikh was a member of the Conservative party until 2000, standing for the Scottish parliament for the Tories in 1999. Back then, she ran a campaign focused on family life, law and order, health and education. She spoke out against the SNP pledge to increase taxes, and attacked Alex Salmond\u2019s criticism of Nato\u2019s involvement in the Kosovo war, saying that his description of the intervention as \u201cunpardonable folly\u201d was \u201chopelessly naive\u201d and that he should hang his \u201chead in shame\u201d. Ahmed-Sheikh was a member of the Labour party in the 1990s and campaigned for former Glasgow Labour MP Mohammad Sarwar. A practising Muslim, Ahmed-Sheikh left the Conservatives over the party\u2019s policy on asylum seekers and joined the SNP in 2000. She was born in Chelsea and raised in Edinburgh; her mother is half-Welsh and half-Czech and her father was from Pakistan. John Nicolson (SNP) East Dunbartonshire Nicolson beat the senior Liberal Democrat minister Jo Swinson to take the East Dunbartonshire seat. Swinson was thought to be a future leader of her party but was instead the first coalition minister to lose her seat in the election. Nicolson is a former speechwriter for US senator Daniel Moynihan and a former BBC journalist who reported for Panorama, Newsnight and Watchdog. He was the main presenter of BBC Breakfast for a number of years. During the Scottish referendum campaign he worked for the SNP and helped to prepare Alex Salmond for the second televised independence debate with the former Labour chancellor and head of the Better Together campaign, Alistair Darling. Salmond was praised for his performance in the debate. Nicolson studied at Glasgow University, where he was the Scottish and World Student debating champion. Mhairi Black (SNP) Paisley and Renfrewshire The University of Glasgow law student comfortably overturned Labour election chief Douglas Alexander\u2019s majority, gaining more than 23,000 votes to become the UK\u2019s youngest MP since the 17th century. From a family of lifelong Labour supporters, she emerged as a nationalist during last year\u2019s referendum campaign, giving up her job in the Pizza Mario chip shop to concentrate on politics. She said that she wanted to force the British government to allow another vote on Scottish independence. Not all of her publicity has been helpful. A self-confessed political \u201cgeek\u201d and football obsessive, she was caught on camera saying she wanted to \u201cstick the nut on\u201d \u2013 head butt \u2013 Labour councillors after the referendum result. Days after her selection as a parliamentary candidate, it was found her Twitter account still held tweets dated from when she was a teenager. During an especially tense match between her beloved Partick Thistle and rivals Celtic, she had tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve only just realised \u2013 I really fucking hate Celtic\u201d, and \u201cCeltic, yer a joke! #scum.\u201d Stuart Donaldson (SNP) West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine Donaldson\u2019s mother, Maureen Watt, is the minister of public health in the Scottish government at Holyrood. After her son, 23, who studied at the University of Glasgow, was selected to contest the West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine seat, she told the Press and Journal newspaper: \u201cI am flabbergasted. Someone who was quite resistant to ever delivering a leaflet for me is now standing for the Westminster parliament.\u201d Donaldson\u2019s grandfather Hamish Watt represented Banffshire and Moray for the SNP at Westminster between 1974 and 1979. The then Labour prime minister Jim Callaghan memorably warned the nationalists they were \u201cturkeys voting for an early Christmas\u201d, when they tabled a no-confidence motion in the Labour government. In 1979 Watt was defeated by the Conservative David Myles as the SNP lost nine of its 11 seats. Naseem Shah (Lab) Bradford West Her extraordinary story includes her father running away with a 16-year-old neighbour, her mother murdering an abusive husband and her own marriage by arrangement when she was 15 to an older man in Pakistan. Shah chairs a mental health charity and is well known locally in Bradford for campaigning on behalf of her mother, who was released from prison in 2000 after serving 14 years for putting poison into the food of Mohammed Azam, a local drug dealer who she feared was planning to sexually abuse her daughters. Following her election victory on Thursday, Shah criticised the campaign of her rival, George Galloway of the Respect party, saying that it had \u201cdemeaned democracy\u201d. Galloway, who has suggested that he now wants to be the mayor of London, had alleged that Shah had lied about being forced into marriage when she was 15. Stephen Kinnock (Lab) Aberavon The son of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock is married to the prime minister of Denmark, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. The Cambridge University graduate, who went on to work in Brussels where he met his wife, has worked for the British Council and the World Economic Forum and speaks five languages. Before his election he claimed to be undaunted by the prospect of living hundreds of miles away from Thorning-Schmidt, who is facing elections in Denmark later this year. After marrying in 1996 they lived and worked in Brussels, before his wife\u2019s political work took centre stage and she moved back to Denmark. At that point, Kinnock got a job at the British Council in St Petersburg and Sierra Leone, before working for the World Economic Forum in Geneva. He finally returned to the UK to work in London for a consultancy firm. He has also had a brief career as an actor \u2013 appearing in a 2007 Russian TV movie, Haute Couture Dress. Maria Caulfield (Con) Lewes A nurse at the Royal Marsden hospital in London, where she is a research sister leading a team in breast cancer research, Caulfield is also an owner and shareholder of Lewes football club and a non-executive director of the local housing charity BHT Sussex, which works to prevent homelessness. The daughter of Irish immigrants who went on to become farmers, she says she \u201cgrew up in a rundown area of south London where the only careers advice given to us was the phone number of the local council housing office for when you became a single mum and needed a council flat\u201d. A part-time shepherd, she is also regional deputy chairman for Conservatives in the southeast. In 2010 she stood as parliamentary candidate for Caerphilly, where she lost but achieved a 6.4% swing to the Conservatives. In 2011, she was the Sussex coordinator of No2AV in the referendum on changing the voting system. Johnny Mercer (Con) Plymouth Moor View A former army commando and veteran of three tours of Afghanistan, Mercer has accused Labour governments of stifling ambition. Before starting his election campaign he claimed to hate social media and not own a mobile phone. Mercer has campaigned on the importance of treating mental health problems among army veterans. In Thursday\u2019s election vote, he enjoyed a 4.3% swing to the Conservatives in his seat, which was such a surprise that he had not prepared an acceptance speech. The father-of-two told the local newspaper, the Plymouth Herald: \u201cIt was a bit of a surprise. But it shows that if you enthuse people and put people first, you can really make an impact. When I get to parliament, I want to be working on mental health and veterans\u2019 care, which is appalling and needs improvements. That is my priority and I have said that from the start and I\u2019m not going to change that.\u201d Thomas Tugendhat (Con) Tonbridge and Malling A former journalist, management consultant and energy analyst, Tugendhat joined the Army Reserve and served on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has also worked as an aide to the chief of the defence staff. Tugendhat read theology at Bristol University and then studied for a masters in Islamics at Cambridge University. His study included learning Arabic in Yemen. After graduating, Tugendhat travelled to Beirut to be a journalist in the 1990s, where he wrote about the southern Lebanon conflict as well as regional politics and economics. It was on returning to the United Kingdom that he joined the Territorial Army and was mobilised as an Arabic-speaking intelligence officer to serve with the Royal Marines in Iraq. His father is Mr Justice Tugendhat, a high court judge, and his uncle is a Conservative peer, Baron Christopher Tugendhat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
