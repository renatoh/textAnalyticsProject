It\u2019s the companion series to The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, one of my absolute favourite shows of last year. In that series we met Matthew Heawood and Kennedy Fisher, the two hosts of Mystery Machine, a podcast about, yes, unsolved or unusual true-life mysteries. They followed up a story about a man who seemed to disappear from a locked room in a sanatorium, and that tale led them, twistily, to a strange and scary occult world, where strange and scary things happened. Fisher, in particular, had a very tough time\u2026 Did I mention that none of this is real? Maybe I didn\u2019t. Because the great enjoyment of both Charles Dexter and, now, The Whisperer is that they are fiction \u2013 drama \u2013 that seems to be fact. Both take the familiar format and aural style of murder-mystery podcasts \u2013 intrepid podcast-makers following a hunch, while telling us in real time what they\u2019re up to and how they\u2019re feeling \u2013 and use it to create a world we feel we know and understand. Then, into that familiarity, they insert something very unfamiliar indeed\u2026 Both shows are devised, written and directed by Julian Simpson and are based on HP Lovecraft tales. I\u2019ve never read either of the stories the series are based on, but you definitely don\u2019t need to in order to enjoy yourself. I\u2019d recommend that you listen with earphones though: much of the \u201cwhat was that?\u201d jumps and surprises come with the enveloping intimacy of the sound, the weird noises in your head. And you will jump. At one point, listening to the second episode, I suddenly stopped walking and exclaimed \u201cNo!\u201d so loudly that the dog dropped whatever she\u2019d picked up and made \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d eyes. I know I bang on about disliking audio drama a lot in this column, but it really has been stagey and moribund for years. This podcast is an example of how well it can be done. Barnaby Kay and Jana Carpenter, who play Heawood and Fisher, are completely natural, and every use of recorded material is believable. There is texture in the sound, which is properly recorded, whether a voice on an old-fashioned minicassette, the fizz and hiss of short wave or the crunch of leaves underfoot. Three episodes have been released so far, and things are getting deeper and more convoluted. We\u2019re in East Anglia, mostly, near Dunwich, wandering with Heawood and Fisher through forests, around suddenly abandoned houses, meeting too-nice-to-be-wholesome vicars, and strange women who talk in riddles. Everything seems to be leading back to elements of the first series too, so I would listen to that before you get into The Whisperer. Ooh, you\u2019re in for a treat. Another treat for you: the new Slow Burn podcast. This strand made its name with two series that examined past political, um, situations. The first concerned Nixon and Watergate, while the second centred on the Clinton years, especially the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Clinton\u2019s impeachment. So you might expect Slow Burn\u2019s third series to also be built around recent American political history. And it is, sort of. This one tells the tale of 90s rappers Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur, another real-life story that\u2019s been revisited several times, often sloppily or sensationally. Slow Burn, which originates from Slate magazine, takes a different approach. It doesn\u2019t overexplain, but just starts the story, often from a place you don\u2019t expect. Series one began with Martha Mitchell, the wife of Nixon\u2019s first attorney general. Series three starts with Tupac in trouble, various legal cases hanging over him. He goes to hang out at a recording studio\u2026 This series is presented by Joel Anderson (the first two were hosted by Leon Neyfakh), and he has clearly done his research, interviewing those who were actually there when Tupac was on the medical trolley having been shot. The detail is what gets you: within minutes, you find out who he\u2019s actually flipping the bird to in that picture. Another great podcast to transport you away from the smaller, sadder stories of today. Three shows to help you sleep Sleep Meditation Podcast God, I love this podcast. Every episode is just a 30-minute loop of reassuring noises to help you drop off. So there\u2019s Super Calm Ocean Waves, or Grandma\u2019s Living Room (slight sound of a ticking clock), or Oscillating Fan Noise, or (a personal favourite) Purring Cat Sound. Listeners make requests, too, usually very specific, which gives the whole podcast a somewhat pervy \u201cwhatever turns you on\u201d feel. So there\u2019s Rain on a Car Roof With Windscreen Wipers and Slight Wet Road Noises (be warned: the windscreen wipers squeak). Zzzz. Sleep Cove Hosted by the relaxingly toned, slow-paced Christopher Fitton, this podcast offers what it calls sleep stories, such as Alice in Wonderland or Aladdin. Fitton reads these carefully, without much characterisation, over the kind of spacey background sounds that you might hear in the relaxation part of a yoga class. Other episodes offer guided sleep meditation or hypnosis, specifically designed for mental troubles such as overthinking, confidence and (duh) insomnia. Sleep Cove is fairly new, so there aren\u2019t that many episodes, but it\u2019s nice to hear a sleepy show hosted by someone English, rather than American. 99% Invisible OK, so this one isn\u2019t really conducive to sleep, as 99% Invisible is one of the most enthralling listens out there, but Roman Mars\u2019s chocolate voice is just soooo gorgeous and warm that I can\u2019t not mention it. 99% is the reason I first started getting into podcasts, and listening as you snuggle down makes you feel as though you\u2019re expanding your knowledge of the world as you relax. Choose from hundreds of episodes. The most recent, about baby incubators, is excellent, and Mars is in it quite a lot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
