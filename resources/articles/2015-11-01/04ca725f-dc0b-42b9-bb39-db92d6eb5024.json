Fails] isn\u2019t brilliant. But let\u2019s just say he didn\u2019t look impressed by losing the title or Fury\u2019s Aerosmith rendition. But perhaps his biggest disappointment will be that he lost in such half-hearted fashion. Any half-decent heavyweight would have fancied their chances against Klitschko on that performance. Was he old? Injured? Ready to retire? Psyched out by Fury? We\u2019ll find out in the next few months, perhaps but Ali v Frazier that was not. It really was a sad, pale ghost of the great heavyweight fights of the past, even with the shock result. The fight stats tell you a lot: Landed: Klitschko: 52 Fury: 86 Power blows: Klitschko: 18 Fury: 48 Thrown: Klitschko: 69 Fury: 202 Fury thanks the fans and calls Klitschko \u201ca great champion\u201d and apologises for the antics in the build-up in the fight - he says he was just trying to show he was younger and more hungry. He then serenades his wife with some Aerosmith. Really. Not even one of their good ones: Was there ever a more appropriately named champion than Tyson Fury? But there was very little Fury in that fight, Klitschko simply slid to defeat after a brilliant career. Fury thanks Jesus. \u201cMy rock, my salvation\u201d. He goes on to say \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d and breaks down in tears. Lennox Lewis is one of the interviers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to come to a foreign country and win,\u201d says Fury. \u201cWhen I got [the point docked] I thought I had lost\u201d. The judges have spoken! Or written. A unanimous decision: 115-112, 115-112, 116-111. Klitschko has to go for the knockout now (by my estimation) but - story of the fight - clinches rather than comes forward. At last, there\u2019s a big right from Klitschko who rocks Fury but he stays up, that\u2019s all he needs to do. Again Klitschko comes forward and lands another good shot, is it too little too late? A tired right from Fury and Klitschko sways out the way. The bell goes and Fury celebrates like he\u2019s won the fight. I agree but what will the judges say? Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 10-9 Fury (Klitschko 113-114 Fury) By my count, Klitschko needs a knockout - but will his home advantage tell with the judges? He doesn\u2019t look urgent in the ring, anyway. Klitschko has the chance to do some damage on the inside but once again fails to press home the opening with any aggression. Another cut opens on Klitschko\u2019s face although it could have a been a clash of heads again. Shortly afterwards Klitschko goes for a big left, misses and Fury connects. Fury docked a point for more rabbit punches. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 10-8 Fury (Klitschko 103-105 Fury) Fury seems keen to come in on the champ now, working him with a few jabs to the body - all the significant shots had gone to the head so far this fight. Klitschko brushes Fury with a jab and then the challenger returns fire with some glancing body blows. The pair barge each other as they walk to their corners. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get this Not Safe For Work,\u201d says Klitschko\u2019s corner. They tell him to work the challenger to the body and then head. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 9-10 Fury (Klitschko 93-97 Fury) HBO\u2019s card has Fury ahead 74-78 too. A nice right hand from Klitschko jars Fury, who looks in trouble for the first time tonight. The challenger also gets a warning for a rabbit punch. The champ is definitely waking up now ... but then a big left hook from Fury with Klitschko off balance, and another cut opens up on the champ\u2019s forehead. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 10-9 Fury (Klitschko 84-87 Fury) I should emphasise that Fury has been far from brilliant this fight, it\u2019s just been Klitschko\u2019s refusal to fight has been stunning (or boring, depending on your view). But Klitschko rallies slightly and gets his jab working for the first time in the fight, landing two good blows on his opponent. \u201cRe: Joyce Carol Oates\u2019s tweet earlier,\u201d writes Chris Taylor. \u201cCan\u2019t help noticing that her first novel was called With Shuddering Fall. Ominous.\u201d Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 10-9 Fury (Klitschko 74-78 Fury) Fury is in control but Klitschko is waiting and waiting and waiting.Fury has switched stances and made it tough for the champ to settle but his meekness is odd and now Fury comes forward and Klitschko has to duck under a sharp right hook. Fury had one good jab to Klitschko\u2019s face and a few glancing rights. Unless the judges are seeing something I\u2019m not, we will have a new champion. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 9-10 Fury (Klitschko 64-69 Fury) Whether Klitschko is getting old or not, he\u2019s just not throwing punches. And it\u2019s not like Fury has worked him particularly hard, he\u2019s been more aggressive than the champ but that\u2019s not saying all that much. Fury gets two good jabs in but Klitschko doesn\u2019t reply and comes in to clinch. Fury has thrown 162 punches to Klitschko\u2019s 96. \u201cWatch out, he\u2019ll take a chance soon,\u201d says Fury\u2019s corner. Fury in control by my call on points. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 9-10 Fury (Klitschko 55-59 Fury) More non-events to start the round but Klitschko has a cut underneath his eye, the first physical sign that the champ has struggled in the fight. Fury has a wild swing that in which he turns himself around. He dances away. Klitschko misses a right over the top as the round ends. \u201cVladimir is the aggressor and may be luring Tyson into overconfidence that he can take advantage of,\u201d writes Mayette Sewell. The replays show the cut was caused by a clash of heads rather than a blow. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 9-10 Fury (Klitschko 46-49 Fury) Klitschko is leaning in to Klitschko but the Ukranian has yet to take advantage of the opening. It\u2019s been pretty tame stuff so far. Fury seems to get bored and unleashes a hook that Klitschko fends off. Klitschko gets his first good right in all fight as the bell sounds, the only time Fury has looked troubled. Klitschko\u2019s corner tells him to start throwing more power shots. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 10-9 Fury (Klitschko 37-39 Fury) The longer Fury stays - and even stays ahead - in this fight the more confidence he will gain. Fury has shown he can stay with the champ ... so far. Fury has his hands hanging low, hardly the sign of a man who is intimidated. And now he\u2019s switched to southpaw, disrupting Klitschko\u2019s rhythm. He\u2019a asking the champ to come forward but he doesn\u2019t bite. Only three punches landed that round, two of them to Fury. I\u2019ve got Fury winning all three rounds but they\u2019ve all been close. Fury has landed 17 punches to Klitschko\u2019s 11 for the fight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 9-10 Fury (Klitschko 27-30 Fury) Fury gets the first blow of any note in, but Klitchko gets a jab to the head and then body. Klitschko is already more aggressive than he was in the opening round, coming forward. But then Fury steps up and rattles Klitschko with a good combination to the head. Klitschko still to risk any kind of right hand, working off his jab. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 9-10 Fury (Klitschko 18-20 Fury) Fury twitches this way and that, with Klitschko unable to connect with that famous jab. Neither man lands a blow with a decent punch in the first 90 seconds. Fury gets the first proper connection though a straight jab to the face. Both men then trade blows to the back of the head. Fury throws more punches and lands the one power punch of the round. A slow opening though Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Klitschko 9-10 Fury (Klitschko 9-10 Fury) The fighters touch gloves. Fury has been chatting to his opponent ever since they got into the ring. No fireworks as they meet though and they both return to their corners ready to do battle. Dr Steelhammer is still the best/worst nickname in all of sports. And, of course, this: The national anthems. God is asked to save the Queen. He does not confirm or deny the request. An opera dude dressed as Darth Maul then sings the Ukrainian national anthem. Good work, Darth. Klitschko is impassive, like he\u2019s trying to remember if he has watered the plants at home. Klitschko\u2019s turn to walk to the ring. We\u2019re going to get traditional Ukrainian folk band Red Hot Chilli Peppers for his entrance music. He looks calm, a bit bored. Like a man waiting for a delayed commuter train to turn up. Fury is now making his way to the ring. A few yells and shouts from Fury but it\u2019s fairly low key considering some of his antics in the build-up to the fight. Very few boos from the crowd anyway. And why not get one of America\u2019s living authors to give her fight prediction? The ringwalks have been delayed due to a problem with the wraps, according to Sky Sports: HBO is showing what Klitschko has done against taller opponents. It\u2019s not great news for Fury: Klitschko has a 7-0 record (6 KOs) against fighters taller than 6ft 6in. Not that Klitschko is a lock tonight. Bryant Jennings caused the champ more problems than anyone in a long time. While some of that was down to Jennings\u2019s athleticism, others (Fury among them) would say Klitschko, a year shy of 40, is on his way down. The fighters are due out in around five minutes for their ringwalk. Klitschko is currently making his way through the corridors of the stadium, and looks relaxed. I interviewed Klitschko before his fight with David Haye, and his opponent\u2019s trash talking had appeared to raise the the champion\u2019s heartrate by about 0.00000000034 BPM. So stunts like this, will have provoked little more than bewilderment (Fury does have a nice voice though): Fury reckons he\u2019s happier fighting a man closer to his height (6ft 9in). \u201cI prefer to fight a bigger guy,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like fighting smaller guys, they give me problems with their agility. But I have not met a man as tall as me, who is as quick as me, ever. I\u2019ve sparred with lots of people and played around with everybody. His size, his reach, his heaviness, will work against him.\u201d Fury\u2019s right when he says he\u2019s had problems against small men: Steve Cunningham knocked him down not too long ago \u2013 and Cunningham is barely 200lbs. But I\u2019m not sure that translates to an easier ride against Klitschko. If anything causes the champ problems it could be Fury\u2019s height rather than speed: he\u2019s the tallest fighter Klitschko has ever faced, and the Englishman has a four-inch reach advantage. From our comments section. Here\u2019s tempestteacup on Klitschko\u2019s ominous cool before tonight\u2019s fight: I know it\u2019s hazardous to read much into weigh-ins or other pre fight rituals but how calm and classy is Klitschko? He looks in good nick, unruffled and focused. I have a friend who photographed both brothers and found them pleasant, self-deprecating and good company. To my mind there is something more unsettling about his placid, controlled professionalism than any amount of grandstanding. The sinister nature of his almost unapproachable focus. So, er, good luck to Tyson Fury. I don\u2019t think he will be able to pave himself over more than half a fight before running out of gas, after which Klitschko will start to turn the screw. The fight is due to start at 10.30pm GMT/5.30pm ET, undercard/unexpected wild tiger attack permitting. In the meantime, Fury is honest about his underdog status but reckons he can shock the champ with his power: I\u2019m a 4-1 underdog but Cassius Clay was a big underdog against Sonny Listonand so was Leon Spinks against Muhammad Ali and Buster Douglas against Mike Tyson,\u201d he said. \u201cUnderdogs win. I think it\u2019ll pan out with me knocking him out. I don\u2019t intend to leave it to anyone else \u2013 my destiny is in these two hands. Fury is certainly fitter than he\u2019s ever been \u2013 he\u2019s a stone lighter than he was when he fought the similarly magnificently names Christian Hammer in February but he still looked a tad tubby round the waist in the weigh-in next to the ever-ripped Klitschko. But physique doesn\u2019t dictate how durable your jaw is, or how fast your fists move (I, for example, have a fairly flat stomach but am yet to make the grade as a world class boxer). Klitschko v Fury 39 Age 27 6ft 6in Height 6ft 9in 245lbs Weight 246lbs Orthodox Stance Orthodox 81in Reach 85in 64/3/0 w/l/d 24/0/0 53 KOs 18 79% KO% 75% So, who has the edge tonight? The reigning WBA, IBF and WBO champion of the world with 26 heavyweight title fights to his name, or the man who once beat Dereck Chisora? Well, let\u2019s ask Richard Towers, who has sparred with both men: \u201cWhen [Klitschko] throws a punch, nine out of 10 times it lands, and he\u2019s always in position to throw shots. He may be 39 now but there\u2019s no deterioration at all, believe me.\u201d Sounds like a vote for the champion to me. The bookies seem pretty keen on him too: they have Klitschko at 1-5 favourite and Fury at 4-1. Good evening! The good news: we are going to have a fight tonight, with Tyson Fury\u2019s camp agreeing to go ahead after the Englishman threatened to pull out because he thought the canvas was too soft. In a victory for pencil pushers everywhere Fury\u2019s agent said the canvas presented \u201cmassive health and safety issues\u201d (and was worried the softer canvas could slow his man down).
