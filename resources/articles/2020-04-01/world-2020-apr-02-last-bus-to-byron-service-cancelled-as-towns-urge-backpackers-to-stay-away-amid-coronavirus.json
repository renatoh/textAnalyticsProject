The Greens state MP for Ballina, Tamara Smith, and the Byron Bay mayor, Simon Richardson, who have been lobbying the New South Wales government to stop long-haul buses ferrying backpackers into regional areas, welcomed news that Wednesday\u2019s Greyhound bus from Sydney was the last into Byron Bay for the foreseeable future. It arrived just after midday with more backpackers on board. \u201cI was prepared to go in hard,\u201d Richardson said. He had spoken to Byron\u2019s police about meeting the buses and stopping backpackers breaching the Covid-19 movement restrictions. Under the latest measures, travelling for a holiday is an offence in New South Wales and Victoria, but it is not clear how the restrictions apply to backpackers who have no fixed address. Six passengers got off Wednesday\u2019s bus, including 18-year-old Finnish backpackers Lles Shign and Lynn Maendartsma, who in the past fortnight since leaving Sydney have visited Newcastle, Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour. \u201cWe are not frightened,\u201d Maendartsma said. \u201cOur greatest fear is getting stuck in one place, giving all our money out and doing nothing.\u201d The pair, who recently finished high school in Finland, are staying in a backpacker hostel and plan to visit Byron\u2019s beaches. \u201cWe are just going to relax in Byron and chill a little bit,\u201d Shign said. \u201cWe wanted to go to Brisbane but that\u2019s not an option any more.\u201d On Wednesday the Queensland government announced that only people with permits for essential travel would be allowed to cross the state border from Friday. The two Finnish travellers hope to spend at least another month in Australia and are planning \u201cday to day\u201d. Boarding the bus, which was travelling on to Brisbane, was English backpacker Danny Wright. He spent the night in a Byron hostel after leaving Sydney on Tuesday morning. In the past three weeks he has been to Tasmania and Melbourne and is on his way to Airlie Beach in north Queensland, where he will live with friends who own a house. He plans to bunker down there for the corona crisis and is optimistic of finding work. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for backpackers, hostels are closing, but the ones I\u2019ve been staying in are doing everything they can, making sure there\u2019s that 1.5 metres and only 50% capacity in a room. We have no other options.\u201d Wright said he did not want to return to the UK because he would need to stay with elderly family members, and feared making them sick. \u201cFrom all the news I\u2019ve been watching, Australia seems to be one of the safest places in the world.\u201d German backpacker Julian Luss, 18, is living in a Byron hostel with about 30 other people \u2013 two to three people per dorm room. He wants to go home but can\u2019t get a flight until 10 April. \u201cWe\u2019re staying calm and enjoying the rest of our time in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t as much partying as there used to be. Some people are still staying out and having a few drinks with their friends, but with social distancing.\u201d Smith wants all holidaymakers to stay away from regional areas. \u201cOur hospital system in terms of numbers of intensive care beds is minimal, meagre, so in a pandemic will be stressed for our communities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t look after visitors.\u201d She has called on online holiday booking websites such as Airbnb and Stayz to stop marketing regional properties as ideal places for self-isolation. \u201cPeople think that if they are going to be in lockdown, they should be in a beautiful area, and that is understandable, but we do not have the capacity to support them. It\u2019s not fair on regional communities.\u201d Richardson said he was in talks with Byron celebrities to create a social media campaign to persuade visitors to stay away from regional areas. Chris Hemsworth, Bernard Fanning and Tex Perkins led Byron Bay\u2019s fundraiser after northern NSW was hit by bushfires. In the past week the Rural Doctors Association of Australia has called on grey nomads to stop visiting outback towns. In Queensland, caravan vendors told Guardian Australia queries for vans were strong, as city residents head for more remote areas and what they perceive as safety from coronavirus. The federal Nationals MP David Littleproud has described touring caravans as potential \u201ccruise ships of the outback\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
