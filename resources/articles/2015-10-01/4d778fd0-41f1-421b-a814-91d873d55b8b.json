In his first news conference following the sweeping majority Liberal victory in Canada\u2019s federal election, the visibly fatigued leader said he had spoken with US president Barack Obama in a phone call during which he discussed his intention to pull Canada\u2019s fighter jets out of the anti-Isis campaign. \u201cI committed that we would continue to engage in a responsible way that understands how important Canada\u2019s role is to play in the fight against Isil, but he understands the commitments I\u2019ve made about ending the combat mission,\u201d Trudeau said. He did not set out a timeline for the withdrawal. Canada currently has six CF-18 fighter jets taking part in the US-led bombing campaign. They were due to remain in the region until March 2016. Canada has also deployed around 70 special forces troops to train Kurds in northern Iraq, although Trudeau has previously indicated that this mission would continue. The White House in a statement said: \u201cThe two leaders agreed on the importance of deepening the already strong United States-Canada relationship and committed to strengthening the countries\u2019 joint efforts to promote trade,combat terrorism, and mitigate climate change.\u201d Trudeau has said he would work to improve Canada-US relations, which he claims became frosty under Harper. But speaking at a rally in Ottawa earlier on Tuesday, he stressed that he wanted to see a shift in Canada\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cI want to say this to this country\u2019s friends around the world: Many of you have worried that Canada has lost its compassionate and constructive voice in the world over the past 10 years. \u201cWell, I have a simple message for you on behalf of 35 million Canadians. We\u2019re back.\u201d In his first day as prime minister designate, Trudeau also announced that he and his new cabinet \u2013 which will be 50/50 male/female \u2013 would be sworn in on 4 November, as he moves forward on an ambitious policy agenda. \u201cI\u2019m very, very aware of both the opportunity and the responsibility that we have to live up to, having put forward a strong vision for growth, for unity, for positivity in this country,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe now get to start working on delivering that.\u201d In his conversation with Obama, the two political leaders also touched on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, climate policies, and the imminent American decision on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project, which Trudeau supports. Trudeau described it as a \u201cwarm conversation\u201d that also touched on the struggles of balancing political power and parenthood, since both men have young children. Obama \u201calso teased me about my lack of grey hair, but said I\u2019d probably get some quite soon\u201d, Trudeau joked. The new leader also spoke with UK prime minister David Cameron and French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. The son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau won a surprise majority in Monday\u2019s national election, a victory that launched the party from a decade in opposition back into power. It was also a sound defeat for outgoing Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, who has been in power since 2006. Trudeau\u2019s news conference came at the end of a jam-packed first day for the prime minister-in-waiting, which began with him surprising morning commuters at metro station in his home riding in Montreal, snapping selfies with constituents. By afternoon he was back in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, for a rally with supporters. Journalists pressed him for details and timelines for implementing campaign promises, including launching an inquiry into Canada\u2019s missing and murdered indigenous women and tackling reforms to Canada\u2019s scandal-plagued Senate. But he offered few firm commitments, noting he would be juggling the responsibilities of putting together a new cabinet and ensuring a smooth transition of power with a packed international agenda. \u201c[We] will be moving forward with our campaign commitments in a responsible fashion \u2013 we want to be sure the transition is done in an orderly fashion,\u201d he said. He will attend the upcoming COP21 climate change summit in Paris in late November and hopes to attend the G20 meeting in Turkey and the APEC summit in the Philippines, also both next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
