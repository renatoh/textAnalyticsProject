It was not the right policy. And we should have stopped it,\u201d the Lib Dem leader said, when asked by Andrew Neil if she wanted to apologise to people affected by the bedroom tax, saying her party would reverse the policy. Swinson, who is facing criticism of her tactical decisions and voter appeal in a campaign which has seen the Lib Dems\u2019 poll rating gradually slip, also said she would remain as leader even the party ended up with fewer than the 21 MPs they began the election with. \u201cI\u2019m continuing as Liberal Democrat leader,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do and I\u2019ve just been elected to do it.\u201d Asked if she would remain regardless of the result, she replied: \u201cI\u2019m here to stay and we\u2019re going to get a great result.\u201d Swinson is among the leaders of all the main political parties to undergo a grilling from Neil, with the exception of Boris Johnson, who is refusing to agree to an appearance. The quizzing on benefit cuts began with Neil noting that the Lib Dems wanted to scrap the bedroom tax, which cuts benefits for people living in social homes with more rooms than they are deemed to need. \u201cWho voted nine times to introduce the bedroom tax?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats in government, including myself,\u201d said Swinson, who held various junior ministerial roles from 2012 to 2015. She added: \u201cWhich I have previously said \u2013 and I\u2019m happy to say again \u2013 was wrong. And I\u2019m sorry about that, and it was one of the things that we did get wrong.\u201d Swinson also acknowledged that while in the coalition she backed the benefits cap, which limits the maximum benefits income a family can receive regardless of circumstances, and private tendering in the NHS \u2013 all of which she now wants to reverse. Asked why voters should trust her, Swinson said: \u201cClearly we didn\u2019t win every battle against the Conservatives. We fought many battles and we did win battles for more money for schools, for more money for the poorest pupils, for managing to cut tax for the lowest paid. To introduce same sex marriage. There\u2019s many things that I\u2019m very proud of where we made a difference. \u201cBut of course, of course there were things where we didn\u2019t win those battles, and I\u2019m sorry about that. It was not a Liberal Democrat government, it was a coalition government.\u201d Swinson has faced criticism for beginning the election campaign with the argument she could become prime minister. Asked about this by Neil, she said: \u201cClearly, when you look at the polls that\u2019s not the most likely scenario. I will certainly grant you that.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, a campaign visit by Swinson to a youth centre in Streatham, south London, was disrupted by protesters from the Extinction Rebellion protest group, dressed as bees. One of the activists glued his hand to the windscreen of the Lib Dem battle bus. Extinction Rebellion is targeting every party. Other members, also dressed as bees, lay on the floor of the Brexit party\u2019s office in Grimsby, while others later glued themselves to the Brexit party bus. Swinson met the protesters, arguing with them that the Lib Dem\u2019s target of becoming carbon neutral by 2045 was realistic and could be shortened as technology advanced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
