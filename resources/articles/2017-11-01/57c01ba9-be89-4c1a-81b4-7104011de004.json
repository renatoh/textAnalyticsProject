The manager left Mkhitaryan out of United\u2019s defeat at Basel and last Saturday\u2019s win over Newcastle United after the player had started 10 of the 11 previous Premier League matches. Having managed five assists in August, Mkhitaryan has since made none and has scored only once in 11 appearances. Mourinho, who had replaced Mkhitaryan in each of his eight starts, said: \u201cI was not happy with his last performances. I\u2019m not speaking about one or two, I\u2019m speaking about three, four or five. He started the season very well and after that, step by step, he was disappearing. His performance levels in terms of goalscoring and assists, pressing, recovering the ball high up the pitch, bringing the team with him as a No10, were decreasing. \u201cThat was enough [to drop him] because the others worked to have a chance. Everybody works to have a chance. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Mourinho has included Mkhitaryan in his squad for Saturday\u2019s home game against Brighton. However asked if the player had impressed enough in training to earn the recall, he said: \u201cWhen you play a lot of matches, training is difficult to judge because in the end you train in small groups. \u201cYou have always the group that played the last match, you have always the group that didn\u2019t play, you have one group of, let\u2019s say, 10 recovering from the last match and you have another group of eight, nine or 10 that are trying to train. \u201cI cannot say that when you play so much, training is the best habitat to analyse players. I would say in the match, and then sometimes in a couple of minutes you see things. Then, you don\u2019t need sometimes to play 40, 50, 60 minutes for the coach to have feelings and have data to analyse. So I would say it\u2019s on the pitch, especially on the pitch. Tell me on the pitch what you want to do in the next match [should you be retained]. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Mkhitaryan will start but, for sure, he will be back in the group. For him to be back to the group, it means that somebody is going to leave the group.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
