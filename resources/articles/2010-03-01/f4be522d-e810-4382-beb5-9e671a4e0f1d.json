In qualifying third behind France and the eventual winners Germany in the three-man, three-lap event, the Great Britain trio and Hoy in particular were disrupted by a start-line drama when the Scot snapped the right pedal on his \u00a312,000 carbon fibre bike as he rolled up the track to the starter. This is rare enough to be termed a freak accident as the last time such a thing had happened to Great Britain was 2004. \"It's the first time in my career that has happened,\" said Hoy, thanking his lucky stars that the pedal had not shattered as he made his full-bore starting effort, as the shard of metal might well have slashed into his calf. In the ride-off for the bronze against China it was Kenny's turn to pull up, although he merely pulled his foot loose in his starting effort. Once he had been attached to his bike again, he responded well by putting the trio in the driving seat immediately with a personal best start lap of 17.291 which effectively put the Chinese out of the hunt from the off. Hoy's broken pedal in qualifying was more serious, as a replacement had to be fitted and matters were not helped when the 30sec count-down clock was started before the Scot was even back on his bike. \"I didn't get into the start until 14sec to go and Ross and Jason had been stuck on the line for three or four minutes with their legs stiffening up.\" The trio looked a trifle sluggish in the opening lap, riding too close together, so that, when Kenny swung off, Hoy and Edgar were not accelerating as fast as they would have liked. \"We were a bit tight, a bit dead on the wheel,\" said Hoy. Even so, their 43.802 was briefly the fastest time and guaranteed them a place in one of the medal-ride-offs, with only the French and German teams still to ride. The team sprint was the evening's flagship race, as the only Olympic event on the programme, and what counted was how the British would cope after reshuffling their formation in recent months to make up for the long-term absence of their starter Jamie Staff due to a back injury. The rider being asked to step into Staff's shoes is Kenny, who has improved his time for the opening lap from 17.8 to 17.2 in recent months and has two more years to shave off more time. At 22 and a day he has youth on his side, as does the other member of the squad here, Matt Crampton. \"There are a lot of positives we can take from this, even though obviously the outcome was disappointing,\" said Hoy. \"We have found someone who can get close to Jamie's start times and that matters because he is a difficult guy to replace.\" Great Britain's first medal of the championships was assured even before the official opening ceremony when Wendy Houvenaghel qualified second fastest in the women's individual pursuit in the afternoon, going through to the evening's run-off for gold and silver, where she lost out to the American Sarah Hammer. Houvenaghel was the Beijing silver medallist behind Rebecca Romero, and silver medallist last year at the world championships, and looked set for another runner-up slot after qualifying 2.5sec slower than Hammer. Although she gave it everything early on in the final, the result looked inevitable from half-distance. Tomorrow there is a telling sign of the change in Britain's approach since the controversial revamp of the Olympic track programme. No Briton will contest the men's individual pursuit, an event in which the country has a proud record going back to Hugh Porter in the 1960s and Chris Boardman in the 1990s. It is no longer an Olympic event, so not a priority as far as Britain is concerned unless there is a cast-iron medal prospect in the team. Great Britain will be on the medal trail in all the day's other four events. Hoy will look to repeat his gold of 2008 in the keirin \u2013 while avoiding a repeat of the crash here in this event that ruined 2009 for him \u2013 Victoria Pendleton and Jess Varnish race in the women's team sprint, while Houvenaghel, Jo Rowsell and Lizzie Armitstead are aiming for a third gold in as many years in the women's 3,000m team pursuit. Chris Newton is going for a medal in the scratch after finishing a close and frustrating fourth in the points race today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
