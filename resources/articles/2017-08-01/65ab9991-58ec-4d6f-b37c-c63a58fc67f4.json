She\u2019s a star netballer with a swag of World Cup and Commonwealth gold. She the game\u2019s only true cult figure; complete with a band of fanatical supporters, the Sharni Army. She\u2019s also witty, brash and \u201cunashamedly Sharni\u201d. This combination makes the 29-year-old a relatable hero to the girls who wait hours after matches for a selfie, a highly marketable commodity to corporate heavyweights and a \u201cwalking quote machine\u201d the sports media can\u2019t get enough of. Wittingly or not, the exuberant and infinitely likeable goal keeper from Mordialloc has become the accessible face of a sport many still consider staid. In the last two years especially, Layton, who has worn the green and gold 46 times since her 2011 debut, has been everywhere. Regular pay TV gigs, commercial partnerships, TV ads, a rising profile as an animal rights activist, public appearance upon public appearance, radio work and countless clinics. And she\u2019s carried the weight of expectation of being a Collingwood \u201cgal\u00e1ctico\u201d \u2013 one of the band of stars recruited to play for the Magpies in the inaugural Super Netball competition. A side that failed to fire. She\u2019s also a human being. Who, we learned on Wednesday, is exhausted and taking a break from the game she loves. The netball world can\u2019t really be surprised or blame her. It\u2019s a workload few could shoulder. In a surprise announcement, the game\u2019s governing body, Netball Australia said that Layton \u2013 who has been named in every Diamonds touring team since September 2013 and made captain in late 2016 \u2013 will take a leave of absence from netball \u201cafter extensive consultation with a group of medical experts\u201d. The reason given was exhaustion. Layton will miss at least the six-game Quad Series involving Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England, which begins in Brisbane on 26 August. She was expected to captain the side. Coach Lisa Alexander says Layton has had \u201cprobably four years full bore; it\u2019s a mighty effort\u201d. \u201cSharni has represented and led our country with her heart on her sleeve, but is in need of a break. Athletes are finely tuned and it gets to a point where it\u2019s hard to do the things she needs to do,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIt was multi-factorial, but I can\u2019t go into detail ... it was the doctor\u2019s call, as it always is with me, and we\u2019ll make sure she gets the treatment she needs. Our medical and support staff will continue to work closely with Sharni during this time.\u201d Rather than upset the Diamonds\u2019 season, which also includes a Constellation Cup series against New Zealand later this year, before the final push to a home Commonwealth Games next year, Alexander says Layton\u2019s absence will spur the group. \u201cThey\u2019re like my daughters. It is upsetting, but this will galvanise us and she\u2019ll be supporting from the sidelines.\u201d Layton will be replaced by Melbourne Vixens rising star Emily Mannix. Layton\u2019s Australian Diamonds \u201csisters\u201d, past and present, were quick to wish her well yesterday. On Twitter, former captain Liz Ellis said, \u201cTake all the time you need\u201d, and current Diamond Paige Hadley sent \u201clove to an incredible team-mate\u201d. Former team-mate, shooter Nat Medhurst, said it was \u201cgreat to see netball giving Sharni a break to regenerate\u201d. While Layton is known for her physical and uncompromising style on-court \u2013 once famously brandishing a black and bloodshot eye in an ANZ Championship advert after an elbow to the face in training \u2013 there\u2019s no indication the news is related to a specific injury. \u201cExhaustion\u201d seems a carefully-selected word. It\u2019s refreshing to see Netball Australia, which has historically shied away from controversy and the \u201ctougher\u201d elements of the game lest the traditional base be offended, be transparent about Layton\u2019s situation. It fits Layton\u2019s own ethos of openness. If anything, the news highlights the ever-growing expectations on whoever leads what is one of the country\u2019s most successful sporting sides \u2013 male or female. It\u2019s a pressure maybe only Laura Geitz, the former Australian captain, who will return to top-flight netball next season, after missing this year to have her first baby, understands. Geitz was known for her steely calmness and seeming unflappability. But Layton\u2019s journey is different. And that\u2019s OK by us, Sharn. Get well. We\u2019re here if you need."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
