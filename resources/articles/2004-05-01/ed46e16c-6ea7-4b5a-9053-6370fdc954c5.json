The mountainous figure of Leota, a crucial cog in the powerful Wasps pack, is renowned for his huge appetite for junk food and the director of rugby Warren Gatland has taken the extraordinary step of asking a member of his fitness team to go and live in Leota's house for a fortnight to try to keep him sharp as he and his team-mates chase a European and domestic double. With Leota's wife and children back in the southern hemisphere for a holiday, the club's conditioning coach Paul Stridgeon has been told to keep an eye on Leota around the clock, help cook his meals and, crucially, stop him sneaking out for his beloved bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. On the previous occasions when his dietary regime has slipped, Leota's weight has ballooned to 135kg (21st 4lb) but Gatland wants to keep him as close as possible to his current 122kg (19st 3lb) for the rest of the season, and confirmed he is also \"considering\" allowing the 29-year-old, renowned for his massive hits, to play rugby league for the London Broncos this summer to ensure he stays in trim. \"We've got a minder with him 24 hours a day at the moment because he's so important to us over the next two weeks,\" said Gatland, admitting he would not be averse to anything that keeps Leota fit. \"I wouldn't want him to go back to 135kg again so if you can think of another way let me know. \"Whether it's part of his culture or where he comes from I don't know but it's vital for us he stays fit. I honestly believe that, on his day, he is the best hooker in the world.\" Leota had indicated he would like to represent the new Pacific Islands side against Australia this summer but said yesterday his international days were now almost certainly over and that he was serious about the Broncos idea. \"I was brought up in a league family, know the game well and usually play a bit when I'm back home in Australia during the summer,\" he said. \"Another good reason for doing it is to answer all the teasing I get from my brothers who keep telling me: 'You rugby union guys are all pooftahs'.\" Wasps' assistant coach Shaun Edwards, formerly of Wigan, is equally keen - \"I'd pay to watch Trevor go head-to-head with some of those big Bradford forwards\" - but, for now, Gatland wants Leota to concentrate solely on Toulouse and even invited the Samoan around to his own house on Tuesday night to serve him \"steak with no potatoes\". The club's chief fitness coach Craig White says Leota is capable of putting on 4kg in one day \"if he has a really big blow-out\" but, should Wasps win on Sunday and beat Bath on Saturday week to reclaim their domestic title, all restrictions will be waived. \"If we win he can do what he likes,\" said Gatland. Gatland will have to resign himself to losing Rob Howley for the first two months of next season after it was confirmed yesterday that the Welsh scrum-half requires surgery on a broken bone in his right hand. Howley saw a specialist and will have an operation on June 23 which will keep him out for up to four months. The Lions scrum-half has dismissed fears that the injury might be career-threatening. \"There's no doubt in my mind I'll be back in November,\" he said, confirming he would love to go on a third Lions tour next summer. Howley, who originally sustained the injury against Perpignan on February 1, will start against Toulouse but Gatland admitted the centre Fraser Waters is only 50-50 after tweaking his left hamstring against Northampton on Sunday. Wasps will confirm their team tomorrow, with Ayoola Erinle on standby to start if Waters fails to recover."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
