It was towards the end of the 2009-10 season and the Burnley and England goalkeeper, who was then in his 13th year at Manchester United, had reached a decision. He would be leaving the club that summer. Ferguson had wanted him to sign a new contract and had told him the offer was there. But Heaton had turned 24 and he needed regular football. There was a further factor in play, something that would shape the dynamic sharply. Heaton was at the end of his deal and he would leave Old Trafford as a free agent. And so, there he was, about to break the news to Ferguson. Heaton\u2019s recollections are heavy on understatement. \u201cHe was pretty short with me,\u201d he says, before adding: \u201cIt got heated for a minute or two.\u201d It is a scene that is easy to imagine and given the legendary nature of Ferguson\u2019s rages, to embellish to varying degrees. \u201cI understood,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cI\u2019d spent an awful long time at the club, I joined them at 11 and, after everything they\u2019d put into me, I was walking out of the door as a Bosman free transfer. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to that meeting, if I\u2019m being honest. But, deep down, I knew it was the right decision.\u201d Ferguson did too and a few weeks later he had Heaton back in the office. \u201cHe said he was always there for me, if I ever needed him,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cHe respected my decision and he understood it. That was incredible for me to hear. Every time I have seen him since \u2013 you stand up straight and it\u2019s: \u2018Hi, boss. How you doing?\u2019 You never lose that factor. But he\u2019s always been brilliant. He sent me a few messages when I got into the England squad. \u201cI never made a competitive appearance for United but I travelled as the No3 and I got on the bench 20, 25 times for the first team. I was in and around it at that level but I knew I wanted to be a No1. It was always a risk. But I think getting into the Premier League two years ago with Burnley justified the decision.\u201d Heaton is back in the big time, after he and Burnley bounced straight back from their relegation in 2015 as last season\u2019s Championship winners and the club captain cannot hide the excitement. There is a buzz in the old Lancashire mill town, which has endured tough times, and the 1-0 defeat at home to Swansea City on the opening weekend has not dampened it. Liverpool are the visitors to Turf Moor on Saturday afternoon. \u201cThe football club really is the heartbeat of the town,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cYou drive along and one in two people have a Burnley shirt on. My dad was born in Burnley and he was a Burnley fan growing up, and his dad was a Burnley fan, too. I was born in Chester but having had that family connection \u2013 and I\u2019ve still got a few relatives here \u2013 I was aware of how big the club was. Still, when I signed three years ago, it opened my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to have a tightknit community that is so connected to the football club. In this day and age of the Premier League, which is a global brand, there is a real core in the town. You can almost feel the passion and positivity from the fans. They really get behind the players.\u201d Heaton had two seasons at Cardiff City and one at Bristol City after leaving Old Trafford and at Burnley he has yo-yoed up, down and back up from the Championship. It has been a wild ride but the club\u2019s values, as preached by the manager, Sean Dyche, are set in stone. \u201cThe manager often talks about the minimum requirement, which is to give everything you\u2019ve got for the shirt and that message has got out,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cThe fans have seen it over the last few years. If you see someone giving everything they\u2019ve got for the shirt, you can get behind it. That\u2019s been a key factor, certainly in my time. \u201cI don\u2019t have an awful lot of knowledge about the town\u2019s economic situation but one thing I would say is that having Premier League football back helps. It puts it on the map. Everyone is aware of it, worldwide, so that should give it a boost in itself. There really is a good buzz about the football club and it gives everyone a lift.\u201d Dyche has been in charge since October 2012 and in the Premier League there are only two managers who have been in jobs for longer \u2013 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Bournemouth\u2019s Eddie Howe, who was Dyche\u2019s predecessor at Burnley. The watchwords of his tenure have been relentlessness, inclusion, hard work and discipline, and Heaton sees similarities between him and Ferguson. \u201cCertainly, on the man-management side of things, there are things that are similar,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cI\u2019m relatively sure that he [Dyche] has quite a good relationship with the boss and the way he is, I\u2019d imagine he likes to take a bit from people he comes across. \u201cIn my experience with Ferguson, he was firm but he was always fair. He was very approachable. You could talk to him, you could have a laugh but if you ever crossed that line, he\u2019d let you know. That would certainly be a similarity here [with Dyche]. We have fantastic relationships at the club, massive respect but you know that if you step out of line, he will be the first to tell you.\u201d Heaton is asked the hypothetical question about how he would feel about telling Dyche he was leaving the club on a free transfer. \u201cI\u2019m sure he would give me both barrels,\u201d Heaton says, with a wry smile. Heaton was one of the reserve goalkeepers in Roy Hodgson\u2019s England squad at Euro 2016 and his journey to the top can be described as circuitous. During his time at United he had loan periods at Swindon Town, Royal Antwerp, Cardiff, Queens Park Rangers, Rochdale and Wycombe Wanderers, and he is part of the select band to have played in all four divisions of English football. His experience of League Two came at Rochdale in 2009-10, while he remembers the stint at Swindon in 2005-06 with particular fondness. \u201cAndy King took me there as a 19-year-old and I got my first league experience in League One,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to him now, thinking back. It\u2019s tough to get that opening but he took a risk on me. On some days it was good and on others, it was not so good. You\u2019ve just got to go through that.\u201d The lot of a young goalkeeper, particularly at a top club, can seem thankless. They work and they work but the breakthrough can resemble a dot on the horizon. At United, Ferguson was never going to drop Edwin van der Sar and when the Dutchman was unavailable in 2009-10, for example, there was Ben Foster or Tomasz Kuszczak to come in. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny one, the goalkeeping position,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like centre-forward, where a young lad might be given, say, 10 minutes. Marcus Rashford at United is a prime example. You give him a taste and he does unbelievably well. You give him a bit more, and look at him now. \u201cYou can\u2019t really do that with a goalkeeper. It\u2019s a position where you take less risks because any slight issue causes a problem. There is no substitute for going through those days when you\u2019ll be chucking it in and at the top level, you just can\u2019t afford that. \u201cYou have to go and gain that experience, go through those things and I was aware of that. I had that desire to play \u2013 what I would call earning a career.\u201d Heaton\u2019s form for Burnley earned him the recognition at senior England level. He made his debut as a late substitute in the pre-Euro 2016 warm-up against Australia and although it was, to use his words, \u201csix minutes and two touches\u201d, it meant everything to him. \u201cThe really disappointing thing about the finals was that everything was in place,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cI actually thought the performances in the group games were really good and if you had asked me two hours before the Iceland defeat, I\u2019d have said: \u2018We\u2019re going a long way here.\u2019 For whatever reason, it just didn\u2019t happen. But on a personal note, the experience was absolutely brilliant and having had that taste, it just makes me want more. I\u2019ve got a real hunger and ambition to step on.\u201d His priority is to help Burnley retain their hard-won Premier League status. During the relegation season in 2014\u201115, they started slowly but in the final reckoning they were only five points off survival. Dyche has found the summer transfer market tough but he did add a midfielder, Steven Defour, from Anderlecht, for a club record \u00a38m earlier in the week. \u201cWe are stronger than last time, we have got more experience and more strength in depth,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to make those things count. We all know it\u2019s going to be a tough challenge but it\u2019s one that we are going to embrace and we\u2019ll see where that takes us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
