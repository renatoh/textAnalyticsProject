That they are leading the pack behind the top three untouchables is tremendously reassuring for English football. Perilously close to relegation last season, playing in a rented home at the moment, with a tiny squad and an untried manager, Fulham are one of the treats of the Premiership thus far. Bobble hats off. On form, it won't take Fulham long to gather the four wins required to hit the magic 40-point mark. With 20 Premiership fixtures to go, they ought to reach their minimum target with plenty to spare. Fulham could never have imagined looking at the January transfer window as an opportunity to consolidate a European-qualifying position, even if they preach a more modest aim for now. 'The next month could be a key period for us,' observes Zat Knight, one of the unsung heroes who has, says manager Coleman, advanced in leaps and bounds this season. 'We want to aim for the 40 points and after that then we can look further ahead. The league is starting to take shape, but we started it looking to stay in the division and we haven't reached that yet. Hopefully, though, we can get to that soon and then maybe we can look ahead to something else, like Europe.' Much of their ambition is interlinked with Louis Saha. Should he be lured away by Manchester United - or anyone else, for that matter - he would be sorely missed in a team who function so well because they embody the determination and togetherness born of a team who have had to grow up together. Coleman's defiant protestations that Saha is going nowhere were almost as welcome to Fulham fans as the two goals that saw off Southampton on Boxing Day. If Saha is Fulham's in-form striker, Villa have their own in Juan Pablo Angel, a player Coleman calls 'a real threat'. The Colombian's renewed confidence is symbolic of Villa's mini-revival: he is performing, like the whole team, with more heart. Villa have the distraction of an FA Cup tie against manchester United looming, but they cannot afford to take their eye off the Premiership ball.
