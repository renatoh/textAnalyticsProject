It is \u2014 and has been \u2014 the antics and voting record of the Bluegrass State's senior senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, over his 24-year career in Washington. And in what I would label the second most important race in the upcoming US election, a businessman named Bruce Lunsford may replace the most powerful Republican in either body of Congress. McConnell, a grandfatherly figure with the charisma of your average door knob and the conscience of a conservative, has never been an overly popular figure in Kentucky. In fact, in every election save his most recent on in 2002, when running against a mediocre opponent while the drums of war were beating in post-9/11 America, McConnell has been unable to clear 55% of the vote. Yet, what he lacks in social skills he makes up for in hard work and sheer shamelessness. McConnell has long been an appendage of the corporate lobby, voting with President Bush 95% of the time and making a career out of doing what's best for your average, economically strapped Fortune 500 CEO \u2014 including bottling up any and all attempts to limit the amount of money flowing through the US political system. His mastery of Senate procedure has served him well, as he has been able to increase his clout and the power of his party through parliamentary maneuvers (recently breaking a record for blocked legislation in the process), while raising enough corporate cash for his campaigns to find a cure for cancer. When this did not suffice, he has always been willing \u2014 much like Karl Rove and his favourite political project George Bush \u2014 to parachute down to the lowest common denominator, whipping up those he routinely hurts through his votes on economic issues by pandering to whatever social phobia he can think to conjure up. It has been abortion here, gays there and terrorism all around. In a state that has the sixth highest share of Christian evangelical voters in the country and a largely white populace, this has often been enough. But suddenly, with Republicans around the country reeling from their association with Bushenomics, an unpopular war in Mesopotamia and a cupboard full of scandal, McConnell has fallen victim to a combination of this sweeping tide and a very able and resource-rich opponent in Mr. Lunsford. Now that public and private polling show this race to be close, the campaign arm of the Senate Democrats, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, has jumped into the race with funding for ads hitting McConnell's rancid record. Even a prominent Republican in Kentucky (a recent candidate for governor of the state) has thrown his support behind Lunsford. Add in an endorsement from the state's largest newspaper, the Louisville Courier-Journal, and recent campaign visits by former President Clinton and senator Hillary Clinton, and you have what is known as \"Big Mo\" working for Lunsford, which must be inducing heartburn at Camp McConnell. Lunsford's charm and common sense policy positions make him an even safer bet for an upset. When I recently interviewed him, he told me he supports the redeployment of US troops from Iraq and universal access to health care, while strongly opposing tax breaks for oil companies and the partial privatisation of social security. These issues all place him on the right side of public opinion, while McConnell is left to try and divert people's attention from his failed agenda with attack ads and shiny objects. Lunsford is also in favour of \"Country of Origin\" labeling, an economically populist position and important stand in Kentucky that puts small American farmers before agribusiness conglomerates \u2013 or McConnell's base, if you will. There is no doubt that Lunsford is still the underdog. Especially with McCain all but certain to handily carry this southern border state in the presidential election. But Lunsford is right in this thing, and he has a serious chance at being Kentucky's next senator. Besides an Obama victory, that would be the biggest victory for progressives, Kentuckians and all Americans on November 4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
