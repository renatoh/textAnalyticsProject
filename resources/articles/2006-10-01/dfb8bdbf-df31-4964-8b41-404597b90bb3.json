There have been no votes of confidence for Steve Bruce this week, and nor are there likely to be. But though the board's patience and loyalty towards Bruce allowed him to hold on as manager despite relegation from the Premiership last season, his future is now to be decided on a match-by-match basis. A few supporters called for Bruce to be sacked after the 1-0 home defeat against Norwich on Tuesday night, but the number of the disaffected is certain to swell at Derby tomorrow should Birmingham, without a win in five matches, lose again. Relegation notwith-standing, Bruce has never had to contend with direct criticism from the Birmingham fans and, more significantly, neither have the board. David Gold, Birmingham's chairman, will not discuss Bruce's position but he described the current run as \"unacceptable\". At the start of the season the former Manchester United defender said the number of derby matches in the club's new division would make winning promotion difficult. Now those fixtures appear more likely to decide Bruce's future, rather than Birmingham's. In the space of 10 days they face Derby, West Bromwich Albion and Coventry. Failure to emerge from that sequence with, at the very least, four points would almost certainly see Bruce lose his job. He was backed heavily in the summer, investing nearly \u00a310m in new players - a level of spending that by far outstrips any of the club's Championship rivals and, indeed, many sides in the Premiership - to build a team capable of returning to the top flight at the first attempt. That investment is showing no signs of delivering the dividend that the board expects. \"If this was a two-bob team where you had spent \u00a3100,000 on a centre-forward, and signed a couple of free transfers, you [would be] getting what you paid for, but that is not the case with us,\" said Gold yesterday. \"We have gone into football clubs and bought their best players. We have gone to Colchester and bought their best player, [Neil Danns] and Colchester are one point behind us. They were favourites for relegation, we were favourites for promotion, and they're only a point behind us.\" The Birmingham chairman could be forgiven for thinking all is collapsing around him, with bad results compounded by speculation linking Karren Brady, the managing director, with a senior position at Capital Radio. Brady has refused to comment on her future other than to say she plans to release a statement soon. There is little doubt that her departure would be a blow. Brady is the central cog at St Andrew's, responsible for the day-to-day running of the club. Her exit would leave Gold and David Sullivan, Birmingham's co-owner, with a huge void to fill. \"Karren Brady has been in this team, as it were, with the Golds and David Sullivan, for the last 14 years and we hope she will be with us for the foreseeable future,\" said Gold. \"But nothing is forever in this life.\" That caveat might also apply to Gold and Sullivan's tenure at St Andrew's. There has been no suggestion that the two multi-millionaires are considering pulling out, but Sullivan has never hidden his frustration at having to travel from his Essex home. The prospect of watching Premiership football softened the blow in the past but there can be little satisfaction in seeing a club into which you have poured so much money toil so painfully in the Championship. For that, Bruce must take responsibility. He raised around \u00a312m in the summer by selling Jermaine Pennant and Emile Heskey, but has struggled to find the right blend with their replacements. Gary McSheffrey and Cameron Jerome arrived at a combined cost of \u00a37m but have managed two league goals between them in 18 appearances, while the acquisition of Radhi Jaidi and Bruno N'Gotty from Bolton has not strengthened the defence as Bruce would have hoped. Indeed, little has gone as Bruce planned. He made several changes ahead of the new campaign, including appointing a fitness coach, and although he would refute the claim that there is any link it appears to be no coincidence that some of his methods altered in the wake of Kenny Cunningham's stinging outburst at the end of last season. Now, though, it is the turn of the fans to fire the bullets, and it is difficult to believe the chairman will not soon be loading his gun as well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
