We win or they win. The loudest opposition to this view comes from multinational American corporations and their Republican shills in Congress, who don\u2019t want tariffs stopping them from making bundles of money around the world. So is this the only choice \u2013 zero-sum economic nationalism or unfettered free trade? No. There\u2019s a third alternative: \u201cindustrial policy\u201d \u2013 which means putting national resources (government spending on research and development, along with tax subsidies and export incentives) behind emerging industries, while making sure the nation\u2019s workers get the resulting experience and jobs. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s new Plan for Economic Patriotism, unveiled on Tuesday, marks a stunningly ambitious version of American industrial policy. Industrial policy centers on a social contract between the public and business: corporations get extra resources to grow bigger and more innovative. In return, those corporations create high-paying jobs in the nation, and focus on sectors promising the greatest social returns. This isn\u2019t laissez-faire economics; nor is it zero-sum economic nationalism. America\u2019s investments in its workers and leading-edge industries wouldn\u2019t prevent other nations from making similar investments. Such competition is positive-sum: if all nations\u2019 workers became more productive, and all socially-beneficial industries grew, the world will be better for everyone. Those of us who advocated for an industrial policy decades ago argued that America already had one, but it was hidden. Our giant defense industry had turned America into the world\u2019s leading maker of bombs, airplanes, satellite communications, cargo ships, and container ships, as well as the leader in computers, software and the internet. Our subsidies for pharmaceuticals under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were central to our dominance over new drugs. But America\u2019s hidden industrial policy didn\u2019t necessarily benefit America. Military spending was bloated and wasteful. The NIH didn\u2019t require drug companies using its research to invest in good jobs in America, or to hold down drug prices. In subsequent years, special tax breaks for oil and gas have hastened the climate crisis. The huge, no-strings-attached 2008 bailout of Wall Street allowed financial executives to prosper even as millions of Americans lost their homes and savings because of Wall Street\u2019s gambling addiction. State and local subsidies to lure companies their way (like the recent bidding war for Amazon\u2019s new headquarters) have merely moved jobs from one place to another, and are ignored when a company decides it can do even better by moving elsewhere. Other countries such as Germany and China have been far smarter and more open about their industrial policies. Smartness and openness go together. An open, explicit industrial policy becomes a national competitive strategy. A hidden industrial policy becomes a haven for political payoffs \u2013 a form of corporate welfare. Which may be why big business in America killed off industrial policy in the 1980s. Such talk threatened to expose how much public money big business was raking in without doing anything in return. Warren berates American companies that \u201chave no loyalty or allegiance\u201d to the nation they were born in. \u201cThese \u2018American\u2019 companies show only one real loyalty: to the short-term interests of their shareholders, a third of whom are foreign investors,\u201d she writes. But Warren is no zero-sum economic nationalist. She understands globalization can be a positive force if focused on improving the conditions of a nation\u2019s workforce rather than on maximizing returns to capital. \u201cGlobalization isn\u2019t some mysterious force whose effects are inevitable and beyond our control. No \u2013 America chose to pursue a trade policy that prioritized the interests of capital over the interests of American workers.\u201d Warren proposes enlarging federal research and development, and targeting it on leading technologies. These R&amp;D investments would be \u201cspread across every region of the country, not focused on only a few coastal cities\u201d. The products that emerge would be built by American workers. Her Green Manufacturing Plan proposes allocating $150bn annually for the next decade to renewable, green, American-made energy products, along with a dramatic expansion of worker training to ensure Americans have the skills for the anticipated new jobs. It\u2019s a national investment in our future. \u201cOver the next decade, the expected market for clean energy technology in emerging economies alone is $23tn,\u201d she explains. It would also be good for the world. She calls for a Green Marshall plan, \u201cdedicated to selling American-made clean, renewable, and emission-free energy technology abroad and a $100bn commitment to assisting countries to purchase and deploy this technology.\u201d As Trump erects tariff walls and rolls back federal efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Elizabeth Warren is promoting a positive economic nationalism designed both to advance America\u2019s workers and respond to one of the most profound crises confronting the world. She reasons that if China can commit its national resources to promoting its domestic industry through plans such as Made-in-China 2025, and Germany can undertake economic planning, there\u2019s no reason America can\u2019t plan a future of cutting edge industries and good jobs \u2013 while combating the climate emergency. She\u2019s right.
