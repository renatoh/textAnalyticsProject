If the result was disappointing, Charlton's performance was distressing. Having taken an early lead, deserved reward for a sprightly opening, they sunk into a mire of mediocrity. Both sides started with five men in midfield and the result was an overcrowded central third and a lot of untidy play, but the visitors changed the course of the game when Darren Byfield came on at half-time to offer Dele Adebola closer support in attack. The state of Gary Johnson's voice after the game was evidence that he had made some forceful points at the interval. \"I just let them know there was no way we were going to win the game if we played like that second half,\" he said. \"I know after a little bit of a rollicking they go out like Trojans - the only thing is I can't get that angry before the first half.\" The Robins looked more comfortable with a four-man midfield and dominated possession while the home side became disjointed. This was, said Pardew, \"as bad as we've played here for a while\". For all that, Charlton had looked reasonably secure as City mounted their comeback. Byfield might have scored with his first touch, a near-post volley from Brian Wilson's right-wing cross, but for the first hour Nicky Weaver in the home goal had to deal with shots from range only. But minutes after almost scoring an own-goal Jamie McCombe brought City level, heading in Lee Johnson's corner. Having scored his first goal of the season against Crystal Palace last month, the captain now has three in four games. Both sides might have stolen a win in the closing stages, Zheng Zhi drawing a fine save from Adriano Basso and Michael McIndoe hitting the bar with a 20-yard free-kick. Darren Ambrose had given Charlton the lead after an intricate exchange of passes down their left flank. At this stage the Robins were guilty of being, as Johnson put it, \"a wee bit posey in our play. I think we'd been reading our publicity too much.\" If positive publicity is a problem, it is one City will have to get used to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
