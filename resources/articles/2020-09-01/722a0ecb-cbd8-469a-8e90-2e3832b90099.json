Kolisi said on a podcast last month that he knew South Africa were going to win the moment he joined Farrell for the coin toss. England\u2019s captain will be available to face Italy despite his red card on Saturday for a high tackle during Saracens\u2019 defeat to Wasps, which is likely to result in a ban of up to six weeks. \u201cOwen Farrell did not know which side he was at,\u201d said Kolisi, \u201cwhich side was warming up, what team was he, A or B? I could see he was flustered and they arrived late at the stadium. You know when you have the feeling that there was no way they were going to beat us.\u201d Jones, speaking before the sending-off, dismissed the observation. \u201cWhat qualifies him to make the observation is that he won and Owen lost,\u201d the England head coach said. \u201cEveryone is always cleverer after you win. I did not see that with Owen and have no other comment to make on Kolisi\u2019s remarks.\u201d Farrell\u2019s temperament has been a running theme throughout his career but England reached the World Cup final led by him and are favourites to win the Six Nations when it resumes towards the end of next month. That leaves Jones, who blames himself rather than his players for the defeat by the Springboks, with little appetite for change. \u201cWe haven\u2019t decided the captaincy yet but at this stage there is no reason why it will not be Owen,\u201d he said. \u201cHe did a great job in the World Cup and the Six Nations. If he is fit and available for selection, there is a very good chance he will be captain. We will announce that at the appropriate time.\u201d Farrell looks set to be playing in the Championship next season after relegation was imposed on Saracens for breaches of the Premiership\u2019s salary cap, as will his fellow England internationals Maro Itoje, Elliot Daly, Jamie George and the Vunipola brothers, Billy and Mako. Jones is repeatedly asked whether their presence in the second tier will have an impact on their international careers, but the extension of the Premiership season into October because of the coronavirus lockdown makes it far less of an issue, with the autumn international campaign finishing seven weeks before England go into camp for the 2021 Six Nations. \u201cI have had a chat with Saracens and will do so again after the autumn,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe have spoken to the players and everything will be based on the individuals. Someone like Mako Vunipola is 29 and has played more than 50 Tests, whereas Elliot Daly has had less rugby. Playing overseas could be an option for some.\u201d Jones has keenly watched the Premiership since its resumption and believes the change of emphasis at the breakdown \u2013 from referees indulging the attacking side to allowing more of a contest for possession \u2013 will help speed up England\u2019s game. \u201cThe job of a referee is to be an enforcer of the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not supposed to be entrepreneurs charged with creating entertaining rugby. That is the job of the performers, the players. We are starting to see a good balance between contest and continuity at the breakdown in the Premiership and that encourages players to be instinctive because they get quick ball. \u201cThey do not have time to settle and become organised, so it gives you half-backs who can play off the speed of the ball, forwards able to run good lines and backs who can push up in support. In defences, it creates opportunities for poachers at the breakdown.\u201d Little expense was spared during the first four years of Jones\u2019s reign, which began in 2015, but the pandemic has forced the Rugby Football Union to drastically cut spending and the national side will not be sheltered from the impact. \u201cWe have to be more aware of costs,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt may be that there is only one dish at dinner instead of two and we will have to look at tightening the staff as well as the operational costs. We need to maximise our revenue so we have to make sure we play good rugby to make people want to become involved with England.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
