In the streets of Miami\u2019s Little Havana and Doral neighborhoods, the Puerto Rican communities of Orlando and Kissimmee, and Cuban-American areas of Tampa, activists from Latinos for Trump and other Republican groups were knocking on doors and talking to families and business owners. They delivered a simple message: \u201cJoe Biden is a radical socialist. Donald Trump is your friend.\u201d And for some of Miami\u2019s Cubans and Venezuelans in particular, familiar with communism and authoritarian rule in their homelands, despite \u201cred baiting\u201d not being a new tactic, it was \u201ckryptonite\u201d, Trump activists claimed. Whatever their motivations, on Tuesday, across the state but mostly in Miami-Dade county, home to 2 million Latinos, voters turned out in droves to hand the president victory by a margin significantly larger than his 2016 success. Trump\u2019s victory cannot be attributed solely to south Florida\u2019s Latino voters, of course. A Miami Herald analysis showed the president\u2019s gains elsewhere would still have won him the state by some 170,000 votes, even without his supercharged performance in Florida\u2019s most populous county. But their support was a crucial building block, and part of a trend that appeared to be reflected nationwide as Trump made inroads with Latino and other minority voters. Many prominent Democrats, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have long been concerned about the party\u2019s vulnerabilities with Latino voters; and in Florida, local workers were worried about the Republicans\u2019 strong ground game while their own campaigning was almost entirely virtual because of the pandemic. In Miami, Trump didn\u2019t win the county, but restricted his opponent\u2019s margin of victory to fewer than 85,000 votes. It denied Biden the valuable ballots he needed to counter a strong showing for the president in the mostly white rural counties in south-west Florida and the Panhandle. As Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s Republican governor and a staunch Trump ally put it: \u201cWhen you lose Miami-Dade by only 10 points or thereabouts as a Republican, you\u2019re going to win statewide.\u201d The Latino voter \u201cbloodbath\u201d in Miami, in the words of the Democratic activist Raul Martinez Jr, was not just limited to the presidential race. Two established US congresswomen, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala, were ousted by Republicans, and like Biden were falsely portrayed by their opponents as radicals with a socialist agenda. \u201cObviously anyone that has experienced socialism or communism, whether it be in Cuba or Venezuela, it\u2019s basically just kryptonite when they hear those words,\u201d said Katrina Campins, a Cuban-American real estate agent in Miami and an advisory board member of Latinos for Trump. \u201cSo it was very important to them to go out and vote for President Trump because he stands for the same things that they stand up for, which is freedom first and foremost, and family. No one wants to be a socialist and communist and a lot of people, my parents included, were having and still have PTSD from what they went through, and the Castro regime.\u201d Campins, who was a contestant on Trump\u2019s reality series The Apprentice in 2004, said any candidate seeking the support of Hispanic and Latino voters needed a deep understanding of their diversity. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand is that you can\u2019t just box anybody into Latinos or Hispanics, you have to understand the culture. Everybody\u2019s different, everybody has things that are important to them,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe Biden really missed the mark on that. He thought that by playing the song Despacito he would get the Latino vote. It was embarrassing to watch him do that, you know?\u201d Other analysts agree that Biden was \u201cout to lunch\u201d when it came to courting Latino voters. \u201cFor a state like this with a 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans, anybody who brings 150,000 votes to the party gets the girl,\u201d said Guillermo Grenier, a Cuban-born professor of sociology at Florida International University and the co-author of the book This Land is Our Land: Immigrants and Power in Miami. \u201cFrom Reagan, through the 80s and 90s to the present, Republicans built a strong ground game, they are on the ground filling out the immigration papers for the people who can\u2019t speak English, filling out Social Security paperwork, driving people to the polls. They actually built the base. \u201cDemocrats need to establish a ground game. They can\u2019t fly in Obama and talk about Cuba every four years. They need to develop a strategy that will deal with Cuban Hispanics as citizens not as exiles, not as folks that care more about foreign policy than they do about domestic policy.\u201d Grenier also believes Trump\u2019s \u201csocialism\u201d messaging over Biden, while effective, was not the central issue that drove Latino voters to the polls. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people buy it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not an issue during the Clinton-Trump campaign, that meme did not make it into the Republican narrative. Now the Democrats kind of call attention to themselves as being democratic socialists in a way, so it entered the Republican narrative as a national message. You have people in West Virginia saying we don\u2019t want socialists right, like they\u2019d know socialism. \u201cBut it does resonate more in south Florida because it is shorthand for all of the things that the Democratic party can be slammed on. It resonates because the Republican party has done its work here for the last 40 years building a really strong echo chamber. The Cubans live in a kind of a Republican bubble here, and I think when the dust settles we\u2019ll find Trump probably didn\u2019t get a great amount of votes more than when he ran against Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s just that Hillary Clinton turned out more people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
