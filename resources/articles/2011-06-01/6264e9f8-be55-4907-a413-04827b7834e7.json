Set up by entrepreneurs Dave Robinson and Andrew Jakeman with a \u00a3400 loan, it went on to release the UK's first punk single, the Damned's New Rose, but more importantly, set the template for the British indie label: irreverent, iconoclastic, hipper, smarter and faster to react to new musical developments than any major could hope to be. As the label's own publicity put it: \"If it ain't Stiff, it ain't worth a fuck.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
