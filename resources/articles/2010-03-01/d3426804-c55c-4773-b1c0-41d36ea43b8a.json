Whoever makes an impression here is tipped to be everywhere come the summer: early reports suggest the Drums, Neon Indian and Washed Out are the ones to watch. None of these bands are exactly undiscovered: the Drums have appeared on the cover of NME, Neon Indian has performed on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon and Washed Out released their debut EP last year. Has the breakneck speed with which bands are now broken online usurped the need for SXSW? Rumoured appearances from the likes of Hole, Justin Timberlake and Muse suggest the festival is becoming more of a platform for established acts to garner credibility than a breeding ground for genuinely new bands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
