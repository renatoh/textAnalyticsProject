Daniel Taylor was our man in Manchester, and here\u2019s his verdict. Thanks for reading this MBM and make sure to come back to us tomorrow lunchtime as Liverpool prepare to respond against Burnley! And now it\u2019s Pep\u2019s turn! \u201cIt was almost impossible to attack them, they played so deep. It\u2019s so difficult. But we created enough chances, and after the first goal it is easier. But the game was never over. The first goal is a debate for the referee, I don\u2019t know. But it is easy: VAR. Ask the Premier League why it is not here. But some teams didn\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want to score goals that are offside. Raheem Sterling can do better. He did not play good in the first half. But he scored three in the second, which is fantastic. But he can do better. Most of the games will be like this, tight and difficult.\u201d Javier Gracia is clearly frustrated, but doesn\u2019t see the point in going off on one, live on BT Sport. \u201cWe play a very good first half. Collectively a very good performance. I think everybody has seen what happened, I never criticise the referees and I\u2019m not going to do it either. There is position and influence, and I think it is clear. I have confidence in all of our players, I know they are able to compete with other teams. Now we have to play eight games more in the league plus a cup quarter final. It is important that they are ready. We did our best.\u201d Here\u2019s Raheem Sterling, the man of the moment, talking to BT Sport! \u201cThe first half was very difficult. it was hard to break them down, they were very compact. We got the luck with the first one, and had a few more chances after that. We knew we only had 45 minutes left, and had to go for it and be more aggressive, and that\u2019s what we did. I don\u2019t know exactly what happened with the first goal, but I was praying and hoping, and we got some slight fortune, and we deserved it. I\u2019m trying not just to score goals, but important goals. We\u2019re taking it a game at a time, we\u2019re strong contenders. Today it was really difficult, and it\u2019ll be a difficult run-in, but now we\u2019re going to focus on the FA Cup.\u201d City are on some run. That\u2019s 16 wins in their last 18 matches in all competitions! They haven\u2019t even been particularly impressive in their last four games, yet during that period have picked up all nine Premier League points on offer and won the first major trophy of the season! Imagine what they\u2019re going to be like when they rediscover their top form. Dear me. As for Watford, they stay in eighth place in a battle with Wolves for that Best of Rest title. City move four points clear at the top! Some controversy over the opening goal, but City were fully deserving of victory, despite Watford\u2019s spirited show. Over to Liverpool, who really need three points against Burnley tomorrow lunchtime. 90 min +4: He batters it straight into the wall, and into Kompany, making up for his error. It\u2019s a corner, from which City break upfield in pursuit of a fourth. Foden and Jesus combine in the hope of releasing David Silva, but nothing doing. 90 min +3: Now Kompany clatters into the back of Deeney, 25 yards out, just to the left of the D. Deulofeu fancies this. 90 min +1: The first of four added minutes. Deeney wins a header on the edge of the City box. Kompany flicks Masina\u2019s ankle, but it\u2019s a very light brush. Watford want a penalty but the referee\u2019s not interested. 90 min: City make their last change, withdrawing Mahrez and sending on Foden. 88 min: Sane dribbles down the left and purchases an easy corner off Janmaat. From the corner, Gundogan scores three points in the rugby-union style. 87 min: More end-to-end entertainment. A long hoick towards the City box causes a mild kerfuffle. Watford can\u2019t get a shot away, and suddenly Sane is bowling down the left, with Jesus free on the right. A spectacular diagonal ball nearly finds the striker on the edge of the box, but Foster does very well to stride out and hack clear. 85 min: Gundogan slips Jesus free, into the area down the inside left. Jesus drops a shoulder to move in to the centre, beating Foster. He\u2019s about to slot home with Kabasele slides in to block, a superb last-ditch challenge. The resulting corner is knocked long to Otamendi, who heads lamely wide of the right-hand post when he should have done so much better. 83 min: Foster launches another free kick long. He\u2019s looking for Deeney. Ederson gathers and sends it back upfield towards Jesus, who nearly latches onto it on the edge of the box. But Foster gets back to gather just in time. Now that\u2019s end-to-end football. 82 min: A final change for Watford, as Britos is replaced by Cathcart. 80 min: No goal for Aguero today, so that\u2019s good news for Sterling with the Golden Boot in mind. Jesus comes on in his place. 79 min: Cleverley presses towards City\u2019s box. But he loses possession and City break. Bernardo Silva tears upfield, exchanges passes with Mahrez, and nearly dinks over Foster. The keeper parries, the ball breaking to Sane on the left. Sane should probably score, but lashes wildly into the side netting. 78 min: Aguero shoots from a tight angle on the left, having been sent into space by David Silva. Foster swallows at the near post. 77 min: Walker bursts down the right and reaches the byline unchallenged. He whistles a low cross through the six-yard box. Had Sane made the run, he\u2019d have had a simple tap-in. Britos knocks the ball out for a corner, from which very little occurs. 75 min: Deulofeu powers down the right and nearly has the shirt taken off his back by Otamendi. A free kick just to the right of the City box. Watford load the area. Otamendi makes up for the foul by powerfully heading Deulofeu\u2019s set piece away. 73 min: Aguero turns on the jets and dribbles down the inside-right channel, nutmegging Cleverley and then dancing past Masina, into the area. He can\u2019t jink past Britos as well, though. Not quite Maradonaesque, but not far off either. 72 min: It\u2019s raining heavily all of a sudden, mirroring moods in Hertfordshire and Merseyside no doubt. And yes the home fans are singing in it. 70 min: City aren\u2019t exactly rocking after that Watford goal. A lot of possession in the midfield, taking the sting out of the game and ensuring Watford don\u2019t gain any unnecessary momentum. 68 min: Sane blams it straight into Doucoure\u2019s lug. The Watford man is floored, and play is immediately stopped. After some treatment, he\u2019s good to go again. 67 min: City come straight back at Watford, Doucoure bowling David Silva to the ground. A free kick, 25 yards out. Sane fancies it. How about this for an instant impact?! Foster hits a free kick long. Deeney\u2019s first touch is a flick-on header on the edge of the box. Deulofeu\u2019s first touch is to latch onto the knock-down, and slot the ball past Ederson and into the bottom right! 65 min: Success and Femenia are replaced by Deulofeu and Deeney. 64 min: Sterling, having made his mark, is replaced by Sane. Very much a testimonial feel to this now. 63 min: Watford\u2019s bubble has truly burst. They\u2019re sitting back in damage limitation mode. That opening goal undid all of their determined first-half work in short order. 61 min: Only Sergio Aguero (18), Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane (both 17) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (16) have scored more Premier League goals than Sterling, who suddenly has 15! City aren\u2019t just involved in a title race; they\u2019re launching a two-pronged attack on the Golden Boot! A hat-trick in 14 minutes for the irrepressible Raheem Sterling! David Silva plays a perfectly weighted ball down the inside left. Sterling burns past Janmaat, drops a shoulder to sashay his way inside past Kabasele, and dinks a lovely finish over Foster! 58 min: Aguero continues to buzz around in menacing fashion. He\u2019s nearly released down the inside-left channel again, but Bernardo Silva\u2019s chip is a little bit overcooked. Goal kick. 57 min: Gundogan is bossing the game from a deep position. Now he slips Aguero free on the left with a pass down the channel, but the striker\u2019s gone too quickly. Offside. 55 min: Gracia has just had a look at a replay of the first City goal, on a nearby tablet, and is shaking his head in annoyance. He gives a critique to a nearby official. I\u2019m guessing we\u2019ve not heard the last of that game-changing decision. There will be talk, you know what folk are like. 53 min: Gundogan, dropping deep, chips a ball down the middle for Sterling, who chests down in the Watford box. Foster does very well to come off his line and fingertip the ball away from Sterling, though the ball only drops to Mahrez, who smashes a first-time shot wide left of an unguarded net. Mahrez is happy to see the offside flag go up for Sterling\u2019s initial run, though that\u2019s a poor decision, as he was clearly level with the last defender. 52 min: On the touchline, Javi Gracia doesn\u2019t look impressed at all. Pep isn\u2019t particularly happy either, ranting away at Mikel Arteta about something or other, but you know what he\u2019s like. That quickfire double\u2019s got the Etihad bouncing, anyway, as they celebrate their position at the top of the Premier League! Watford are beyond livid, and they\u2019ve failed to clear their heads. David Silva, on the edge of the box, slips the ball wide right for Mahrez, and the ball\u2019s rolled across the face of goal for a simple tap-in. A quick two-goal blitz that\u2019s almost certain to send City four points clear of Liverpool! But after a long, long, long chat between referee and linesman, it\u2019s been given! Janmaat, sliding in behind Sterling, had knocked the ball onto the City man before he shot. So Sterling was not offside any longer ... though Janmaat had only made the challenge because Sterling was offside in the first place! Controversy there. 45 min 40 sec: Gundogan scoops a pass down the inside-left channel. Aguero chests it down to Sterling, who curls a shot around Foster and into the net! But it\u2019s been disallowed, because Sterling was offside. Watford get the second half underway. No half-time changes. City won\u2019t be worrying yet; they were goalless at the break in their last two Premier League matches, against West Ham and Bournemouth, and found a way. Plenty of time left. And on that subject, here\u2019s JR in Illinois. \u201cI have a theory that Ben Foster is actually a superhero. His superpower is time wasting. His powers were at their peak at West Brom under Pulis. Heck, he would even time-waste sometimes when the Baggies were losing just to show off. He\u2019s still got plenty of strength in his abilities though. I have him averaging about 28 seconds every time he\u2019s got his hands on the ball today. Part of his power is the way he almost always manages to escape a booking but I have to say I can\u2019t see him escaping a card today. If he does it will be one of his most heroic performances.\u201d Half-time reading. City depart to a frustrated rumble from the Etihad faithful. They\u2019ve been all over Watford like a cheap suit, and created three superb chances to score. But they\u2019ve all been missed, and at the break, Javi Gracia\u2019s seven-change gamble is paying off. Expect City to turn it up after the restart, as they look to move four clear of Liverpool at the top. 45 min +1: The corner\u2019s worked out to Mahrez, to the right of the D. He sends a rising screamer towards the top left; it\u2019s inches over. Foster had his feet planted. He was never getting to that. 45 min: There will be one extra minute. And City will have a corner, because Aguero tears down the inside left and belts one towards the top left. Foster isn\u2019t to be beaten at his near post, and parries round for a corner. 44 min: Space for Gundogan just inside the Watford box on the right, released by a lovely defence-splitting pass from Mahrez. But the resulting cross is too high and too long, and easily dealt with by the visitors. A little frustration in the crowd, who will have been expecting some sort of breeze, especially when the Watford teamsheet landed. 43 min: Watford can\u2019t get out. City are probing and probing. Doucoure does well to strip Sterling of possession, but simply hacks clear and gives the ball straight back. Watford are doing pretty well to resist, but they\u2019re also a little fortunate that City are running out of ideas. Kompany hoicks a long pass down the middle, and it\u2019s easy meat for Foster. 41 min: Gundogan floats one in from the left. Britos does well to nick the ball away from Aguero ... then gives it back. Another phase of City attack, and Zinchenko slips a ball down the left for Sterling. Kiko Femenia sticks out a boot to divert it out for a corner ... but the referee points for a goal kick instead. Zinchenko is beyond livid, and yaps accordingly at the referee. He\u2019s within his rights to get annoyed by that, of course, but a referee never changes his mind. 39 min: City win a corner down the right. It\u2019s dealt with easily by Watford. Foster boots long. The ball goes all the way through to Ederson, who witlessly returns it to the Watford keeper. Ever so slightly farcical, and the crowd don\u2019t seem particularly impressed with either keeper. A smattering of disapproval. 37 min: A rare Watford attack. Success slips a pass into the centre from the Watford left. Cleverley tries to spin Otamendi in the box but goes over. There\u2019s a little bit of contact from behind, but not much, and Cleverley was playing for it. The referee\u2019s not interested at all. No penalty. 36 min: Gundogan hopes to release the overlapping Zinchenko into the box with a cute flick down the inside left, but Foster reads it brilliantly to come racing off his line and claim. 35 min: City have had seven attempts on goal. Watford none. But you know which manager will be happier right now. 33 min: City continue to probe. Watford continue to hold their shape. Then suddenly Gundogan loops a pass down the inside-left channel to release Aguero into the box! Foster makes a fine David de Gea-style save with his feet, hacking away, but the flag goes up for offside anyway. Probably just as well Foster saved that, because Aguero looked level there. A poor decision. 31 min: Foster takes a long, long, loooooooooong time to blooter a drop kick clear. He nearly pays the price for his faffing in karmic terms, as Sterling returns it with a determined dribble down the inside-right channel. Just as Sterling shapes to shoot from just inside the box, Janmaat slides in to block. What a perfectly timed tackle that was! City are getting closer and closer, though. 29 min: City really should be ahead! Bernardo Silva crosses from the right. It\u2019s blocked, and he gets the ball back. He\u2019s facing back upfield now, but curls a glorious first-time cross towards the far post, right onto the head of Aguero, six yards out. He has to score, but sends his downward header flashing wide left. What a miss by this relentless goalscoring genius! That\u2019s the textbook definition of uncharacteristic, right there. 28 min: This is beginning to get really open now, and Watford are shipping chances as a result. Aguero bustles with purpose down the right. He nearly opens the visitors up. Watford swarm him and just about get the ball away. All very last-ditch. 26 min: City go back up the other end and win a corner through Bernardo Silva out on the right. From the set piece, the same player skelps a low ball in from the wing. Britos backs clear. City recycle the ball, David Silva having another go. Kabasele batters free this time. There\u2019s a half-hearted shout by City for a hand ball, but nothing\u2019s doing there. 25 min: Some nice work by Janmaat down the right. Watford then switch play to Masina on the left. Masina nearly bustles his way past Walker, but the City defender holds firm. 23 min: Zinchenko fizzes a low diagonal cross through the Watford six-yard box from the left. Aguero is a toenail away from prodding home at the far post. He\u2019d have probably been flagged offside, had he scored, but instead it\u2019s taken a nick off a Watford boot and that\u2019s a corner. Otamendi should do better with a header at the set piece. Then Foster again takes an age to restart the game with his goal kick, and the crowd are beginning to view him in pantomime terms. Booooo! 21 min: Watford sit back. City stroke it this way and that. There are no gaps. Aguero gets involved in a great tussle with Britos, who is sticking to him like glue, as he tries to break free down the inside-right channel. He wants a free kick, but it\u2019s nothing more than a fair fight. The ref waves play on, much to the home crowd\u2019s disgust. 19 min: Success attempts to break upfield, and is checked by Gundogan, who hangs out a leg. He wears the sheepish look of a man who knows he\u2019s just got away with a booking. 18 min: Walker is cynically checked by Cleverley as he storms down the right. That\u2019s a free kick near the Watford box, and a booking for their midfielder. Gundogan scoops the set piece into the area, but it\u2019s punched clear confidently by Foster. 17 min: City force Foster into action for the first time, David Silva shooting from a tight angle on the left. Foster has the near post covered and parries away with a strong arm. 16 min: Gundogan tries to slip Sterling away, down the inside-left channel. But the pass is heavy and that\u2019s out for a goal kick too. Foster takes his own sweet time over the goal kick; the referee may soon form an opinion about that. 15 min: A poor shot from distance by David Silva dribbles out for a goal kick, well to the left of the target. No early goal for City, but nobody\u2019s panicking yet. 13 min: Space for Sterling out on the left. His cross flies out harmlessly on the right. City are beginning to push Watford back, the visitors\u2019 challenges and clearances just that little bit more desperate. 11 min: But it\u2019s a dangerous tactic, because Zinchenko curls a wicked cross into the Watford box from the left, forcing Kabasele to head behind for a corner. Watford deal with the set piece, though Janmaat is all over Aguero in the area. A tussle that could easily lead to the ref awarding a spot kick. 10 min: Gray makes good down the right and reaches the byline before pulling one back towards ... nobody. Ederson gathers. The visitors appear to be treating this match very much as a free hit, happy to pile forward on the few occasions they have the ball, and see what occurs. 8 min: City should be leading. Mahrez floats a delicious cross in from the right, and it drops right onto the head of David Silva. With Foster coming off his line and not getting there, Silva should score. But his header, dinked over the keeper, flashes wide. Ah hold on, Silva used his hand! He\u2019s probably a little lucky the referee didn\u2019t spot that, and punish him with a booking. 7 min: This makeshift Watford side are knocking it around with confidence, to be fair. Not that they\u2019re particularly going anywhere, but they\u2019re clipping it about nicely when they do get the ball. Which admittedly is not that often. 5 min: Success chests down a long ball on the halfway line and spins Walker, who sticks out a leg to bring him down. That\u2019s a yellow for Walker, who has already tested the referee\u2019s patience. 4 min: Masina stands strong with Walker and Sterling probing down the City right. That\u2019s decent defence, and he looks to break upfield on the counter but Walker\u2019s not having it and clips him slyly. This is quite an open game already, which might not be ideal for the visitors. 3 min: David Silva floats a pass down the inside-left channel with a hope to releasing Sterling. It\u2019s not quite perfect, and Sterling can\u2019t bring it down with a high boot. Foster is able to claim. 2 min: City are full of confidence, as befitting a team atop the table. Otamendi strides forward and has a crack from distance. It\u2019s straight at Foster. Right here ... right now ... we\u2019re off! City get the ball rolling. And they stroke it around for a bit. Walker and Mahrez combine down the right and nearly thread the ball through to Bernardo Silva in the Watford box, but the door slams. This is already set up as attack versus defence. The teams are out! The reigning champions Manchester City wear their famous sky blue shirts, while Watford wear their second-choice green strip. A pointless change into green shirts didn\u2019t do Brighton any harm earlier today, though one suspects this is somewhat a bigger ask for the visiting team. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail. Pep is asked whether Watford\u2019s selection was a surprise. \u201cYep! I expected Deeney and Deulofeu to play together because in part of the Liverpool game they were incredible together. But of course Javi has his own arguments and decisions. I guess with Gray and Success and Kiko, they will make more runs in behind and attack our space.\u201d Javi Gracia explains his changes to BT Sport. \u201cWe have a big and a good squad, and at this moment I could choose between 26 players. I think it\u2019s a good moment to change. We are playing a lot of games, and I think today we need fresh legs. We have a very important game next week, and this is a good option for today and for the next game as well.\u201d That\u2019s an intriguing selection by Javi Gracia. A surprise to see Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu on the bench. Is Gracia keeping Watford\u2019s powder dry ahead of the big FA Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace next weekend? Then again, it\u2019s not as though Deeney and Deulofeu - or Adrian Mariappa, Craig Cathcart, Will Hughes and Roberto Pereyra - did the business at Anfield a couple of weeks ago. So a different approach is worth a shot. Does Gracia have something up his sleeve? Manchester City make two changes to the starting XI named for the 1-0 victory at Bournemouth last Saturday. John Stones and Kevin de Bruyne are injured, so Vincent Kompany and Riyad Mahrez take their places. Watford make a whopping seven changes to the team named for the last-gasp 2-1 win over Watford at Vicarage Road last Sunday. Miguel Britos, Christian Kabasele, Adam Masina, Kiko Femenia, Tom Cleverley, Andre Gray and Isaac Success take the places of Adrian Mariappa, Craig Cathcart, Jose Holebas, Will Hughes, Roberto Pereyra, Gerard Deulofeu and Troy Deeney. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Kompany, Otamendi, Zinchenko, Bernardo Silva, Gundogan, Silva, Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Danilo, Laporte, Delph, Sane, Gabriel Jesus, Foden, Muric. Watford: Foster, Janmaat, Britos, Kabasele, Masina, Capoue, Doucoure, Femenia, Cleverley, Gray, Success. Subs: Gomes, Deulofeu, Deeney, Sema, Cathcart, Quina, Holebas. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire). Having hit the front of the Premier League race at last, here\u2019s where the reigning champions Manchester City are expected to pull away. Victory over Watford this evening - they\u2019re 7-1 on with your local turf accountant - will see them pull four points clear of second-placed Liverpool. That\u2019ll really put the pressure on the Reds when they host Burnley tomorrow lunchtime. City are on a hot sequence of results, even by their own lofty standards. They\u2019ve won 15 of their last 17 matches, and one of the other two was a goalless draw that ended with them winning a penalty shoot-out and the first silverware of the season. The aggregate score during this period: 54-8. At this point, Watford are permitted to take a deep gulp. Especially as, on their last ten visits to the blue half of Manchester, they\u2019ve conceded three goals on six occasions, shipped four goals on another, and lost nine times. Since winning promotion in 2015, Watford have lost every match against City to an aggregate score of 22-3. But as always in football, there is hope. Watford may be 16-1 for the win tonight, but then you\u2019d have got similar odds for Crystal Palace at the Etihad back in December, and look what happened there. Additionally, Watford are on a decent run themselves, eighth in the Premier League, in a tussle with Wolves to end the season Best of the Rest (this apparently being a thing now). They\u2019ve won four of their last five matches, scoring five at Cardiff and ending Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Leicester honeymoon period after fully 92 minutes. Admittedly the one match they didn\u2019t win during that run was a five-goal shellacking at Liverpool, but we\u2019re trying to provide a little balance here. Also, City aren\u2019t quite at their best right now. They\u2019ve only scored two goals in their last three matches, and had to show true grit to sneak results against West Ham and Bournemouth. And as much as they\u2019ll be desperate for the three points tonight, they\u2019ll have one eye on the visit of Schalke next week, given the Champions League is all about outlandish comebacks these days. City should win. But it\u2019s a free shy at the stumps for Watford, and you never know. A rout? A shock? Either way, it\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm BST."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
