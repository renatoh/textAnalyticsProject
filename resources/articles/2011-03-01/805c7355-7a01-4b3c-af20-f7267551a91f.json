Joshua Topolsky and Nilay Patel are departing, with Topolsky saying in a post on the site itself that he isn't leaving the technology industry or \"the news game\" and that he is staying on as editor-at-large. Owned by AOL, the site is one of the largest tech news sites in the industry, with about 14m visitors per month and a staff of more than 25. Kara Swisher of the AllThingsD site reports that Topolsky and Patel had had longstanding issues with AOL and that the decision was not triggered by the acquisition of Arianna Huffington's Huffington Post site which promoted her to head of content; instead she had tried to persuade the duo to remain, unsuccessfully. However there have been rumblings among the site's staff lately, with two other senior departures, by Ross Miller and (unrelated) Paul Miller: the latter wrote in a recent personal blog post entitled \"Leaving AOL\" about his depature, saying: \"AOL has proved an unwilling partner in this site's evolution. It doesn't take a veteran of the publishing world to realise that AOL has its heart in the wrong place with content. As detailed in the [memo] \"AOL Way,\" and borne out in personal experience, AOL sees content as a commodity it can sell ads against. That might make good business sense (though I doubt it), but it doesn't promote good journalism or even good entertainment, and it doesn't allow an ambitious team like the one I know and love at Engadget to thrive.\" . Miller was referring to a leaked copy of a 58-page memo called \"The AOL Way\" which began circulating earlier this year and detailed requirements for more average page views per article \u2013 up from 1,500 to 7,000 \u2013 more concentration on video up from 4% of stories to 70%. Among the strictures in the document: \u2022 AOL tells its editors to decide what topics to cover based on four considerations: traffic potential, revenue potential, edit quality and turn-around time; \u2022 editors are told to decide whether to produce content based on \"profitability consideration\" - which balances what sort of ads can be placed against particular topics. Stories which cannot attract enough page views are in effect not worth writing; \u2022 in-house staffers are expected to write between five and 10 stories per day. The tensions for Engadget, which has broken a number of technology stories, would be obvious: some stories that its writers might judge important could equally be deemed unprofitable under AOL's calculations. It was the first site to have a full copy of the \"burning platform\" memo by Nokia's new chief executive, ex-Microsoft divisional head Stephen Elop, in which he set out the reasons why the company needed an entirely new strategy in its mobile phone business. Under AOL's costing system, it is hard to know whether Nokia - which has a miniscule market share in the US, where Engadget's princpal audience is based \u2013 would merit the coverage the site gave it. Engadget was founded in 2004 by Peter Rojas, who was the founding editor of Gizmodo, part of Nick Denton's group of blogs, but left after demanding an equity share. Within a year Engadget was bigger than Gizmodo, and it has retained that lead since \u2013 though Gizmodo has achieved some notable scoops, including a prototype of Apple's iPhone 4 which it bought from a person who had acquired it after an Apple employee left it in a bar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
