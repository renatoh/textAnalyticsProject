Thanks for joining me as Justify raced into the history books, this is Greg Wood signing off after an unforgettable night at Belmont Park. What a day for American racing, and the sport as a whole. And the question now is: where next for Justify? As an unbeaten son of Scat Daddy, who died at the early age of 11, Justify is the most valuable stallion prospect on the planet by a very long way. American Pharoah was retired to stud after winning the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, and it is quite hard to envisage Justify doing anything other than procreating after the end of the current campaign. He has all sorts of options on the way to Churchill Downs in November though, including the Travers Stakes at Saratoga, where American Pharoah came unstuck in 2015. They call that race the \u201cGraveyard of the Favourites\u201d, which may give Justify\u2019s connections pause for thought, but the important point tonight is that there is another Triple Crown winner, he has yet to taste defeat and the racing world is at his feet. Justify is a legend already, and he hasn\u2019t finished yet. The presentations are being held out on the track. Here\u2019s more from Bob Baffert: I wanted to see that horse\u2019s name up there. We\u2019ve known he was brilliant from day one. This horse never had a break. It\u2019s been a beautiful run, pretty smooth since the Preakness, and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here again. Watching back the replay ... Wow. That was easy. Justify has just made history in any number of ways, and there is every chance he\u2019s not finished yet. Mike Smith had his opponents where he wanted them from the off, and his stable companion Restoring Hope did a good job of sitting just behind and making sure that any horse looking to challenge Justify for the lead would have to go around him first. Smith then executed the copybook front-running ride, slowing it down a little in the second quarter and saving something for the moment when he stepped into the unknown and went beyond a mile and a quarter for the first time. As it turned out, he had something to spare as he stayed on to beat Gronkowski by nearly two lengths. Justify is a true champion - and he still has several months left this season to further cement his place in racing history. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) is quick off the mark with a quote, from its president Alex Waldrop: \u201cThis achievement elevates Justify into the pantheon of America\u2019s all-time greatest Thoroughbreds. A Triple Crown winner is rare enough; an undefeated Triple Crown winner is rarer still. Justify is only the second unbeaten Triple Crown winner, and the obvious target now is the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic back at Churchill Downs in November. Mendelssohn, who never got a chance to show what he can do in the Kentucky Derby, is likely to be in the field against him there. What a prospect. Gronkowski finished second in the Belmont by the way, while Hofburg finished third. More from Mike Smith: He\u2019s sent from heaven, I can\u2019t describe the emotion going through my body right now.He was standing so still in the stalls, I thought maybe he wasn\u2019t going to break today. Bob Baffert has just become the second trainer to saddle two Triple Crown winners, after Jim Fitzsimmons in 1930 and 1935 (Gallant Fox &amp; Omaha). Brilliant stuff, what a horse. Justify joins the immortals. Here\u2019s Mike Smith\u2019s first reaction I didn\u2019t really have a lot to do Bedlam at Belmont. What a ride by Mike Smith, took charge from the off and never let go. He\u2019s going to win it... JUSTIFY WINS THE TRIPLE CROWN! Justify at the top of the stretch, here they come, Justify in front, a furlong out Into the far turn, Justify in front, going well, queueing up behind.. Halfway, Justify still leads... Smith has taken a bit of a pull in the second quarter, still leads by a length from Restoring Hope Restoring Hope second, Bravazo third Justify covered the first quarter in 23.37 Good start for Justify, he leads. Off and running in the Belmont Stakes ... Justify is in first, won\u2019t be long now. Justify is shortening in the on-track betting, 3-5 at the last show. They are heading towards the stalls, right in front of the crowd. Post time for the 150th Belmont Stakes. Thirty five horses have made it this far, 12 went on to win the Triple Crown. If I can just let my journalistic impartiality slip for a moment: Go Justify! Justify is a shade of odds-on in the UK, and Hofburg is in to 4-1. Vino Rosso is 13-2, Bravazo is 8-1 and it\u2019s 9-1 bar. Not long now. The first I heard about Justify was when I was out in Dubai in late March. Bob Baffert was there to saddle West Coast in the Dubai World Cup. When he saw Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Mendelssohn, who went on to bolt up in the UAE Derby, he was in the habit of nudging anyone nearby and saying: There\u2019s the second-best Scat Daddy in the world They are out on the track. What a moment, history beckons for a magnificent chestnut colt who did not see a track until February this year. And now it\u2019s time for New York, New York ... Here\u2019s Pat Shurmur, the head coach of the New York Giants, to alert the jockeys to the fact that it\u2019s time to climb aboard. Go Giants, and riders up! Justify is drawn in stall one, which would have been disastrous for the Kentucky Derby but is the most successful stall for Belmont winners (and was also where Secretariat, among others, was drawn). Fourteen minutes to post time now, Hofberg is showing at around 6-1 second-favourite on the pari-mutuel. Here come the jockeys, off to the lawn near the paddock for the official jockey portrait before they climb aboard. Twenty minutes to post time for the Belmont, and Justify is heading for the parade ring as a 4-5 chance. Weird, the blogging software is telling me that I definitely posted Secretariat\u2019s Belmont, but for some reason it looks to me like the live version is coming up with Vino Rosso again. Just in case, let\u2019s give it another go. Just took three minutes out to watch Secretariat for the umpteenth time. Big Red stopped the clock in 2m24secs dead, and no other horse has broken 2m26 for the Belmont, never mind getting below 2m25. He is moving like a tremendous machine No Triple Crown-themed blog could ever be complete without an appreciation of Secretariat, whose 31-length win in the Belmont in 1973 would be seen by many - if not most - American racing fans as the greatest performance by any horse, at any track, anywhere, ever. Period. Here it is in all its glory, and take a moment too to appreciate the brilliant call by Chic Anderson, who realised that he was watching racing history unfold in front of his eyes and gave it a commentary to match. The build-up to the Belmont is now well underway, and the horses are starting to make their way from the barns down towards the track where 90,000 New Yorkers are waiting to greet them. Justify will be the 13th winner of the Triple Crown if he wins in about 45 minutes\u2019 time, but only the second to do so undefeated after Seattle Slew in 1977. Bob Baffert, Justify\u2019s trainer, is also one of only two living trainers to have saddled a Triple Crown winner, in his case thanks to the heroics of American Pharoah just three years ago. The other trainer who is still around to tell the tale is Billy Turner, the trainer of Seattle Slew, who is now 78 and was still saddling horses in 2016, when he finished 1,957th on the American list with one winner and around $74,000 in prize money. Here\u2019s an interview with Turner talking about Seattle Slew on the Paulick Report website. The case against Justify this evening is based mainly on the doubts about his stamina for the 12-furlong trip and the fact that it is simply so difficult for any horse, never mind a three-year-old that did not see a track until February, to produce three huge performances in the space of just five weeks. But there is, of course, a strong case to be made in his favour as well. I was lucky enough to be at Churchill Downs to see Justify win the Kentucky Derby, and he is a magnificent specimen of a horse, and of a dirt horse in particular. He is big and strong and yet beautifully balanced with it, and his stride is something to behold. He seemed to float across the sloppy dirt at Churchill, and despite helping to set a furious early pace, he still had more than enough left to press on a long way out and stay on all the way to the line. He certainly looks like a horse with the strength and constitution to take several races in quick succession, and he looked to be in prime conditions as he cantered around Belmont on Friday. Skip to a point around 3m55sec in this video for a section where you can really see the sun gleaming on his back and get at least some sense of the power lurking inside his chestnut frame. Vino Rosso also deserves a mention as a potential winner of the Belmont. He was a fair way down the field in ninth in the Kentucky Derby, but he was a ready winner of the Wood Memorial in his prep for Churchill Downs and in terms of his pedigree - by Curlin out of a Street Cry mare - he has as much chance of appreciating today\u2019s trip as any horse in the field. It\u2019s a moot point whether any of them are really bred for 12 furlongs, incidentally, as speed outsells stamina at the American yearling sales even more than it does in Europe. But since we\u2019re on the subject, the mean winning distance of horses by Scat Daddy, the sire of Justify, is actually a little less than a mile. Vino Rosso\u2019s win in the Wood is here: Blended Citizen is another outsider who might have a squeak. Like Gronkowski, he missed both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, but he has winning form at Belmont from his latest start in the Grade Three Peter Pan Stakes and could well be the type to stay on through fading horses if they go too fast up front. He was a 15-1 chance on morning line odds, and 22-1 in the UK. The Peter Pan is here: Justify was a 4-5 chance on the American \u201cmorning line\u201d, a guide to his likely starting odds in the Belmont, but he was odds-against at 6-5 with at least one British bookmaker earlier in the day and has now settled at even-money. It is very much being seen as a coin-toss, in other words, and while Justify may edge a little shorter in the pari-mutuel betting as race time approaches, he is not going to go off at long odds-on as some Triple Crown contenders have in the past. Big Brown, for instance, was 3-10 to win a decade ago \u2013 and he walked over the line in a very long last place. The winner that year was Da\u2019 Tara, a 38-1 chance, and if Justify were to underperform for whatever reason there are very few runners in the Belmont field that could be ruled out with confidence. That includes horses like Gronkowski, whose last start was in a Listed race at Newcastle when he was trained by Jeremy Noseda. He got plenty of attention from the US media in the run-up to the Kentucky Derby as he is named after Rob \u201cGronk\u201d Gronkowski, one of the NFL\u2019s biggest stars and something of a racing fan to boot, but he was scratched from the race just a few days after the Gronk himself had splashed out to buy a share in his namesake. He has since been switched to Chad Brown\u2019s stable in the States, and such is the interest in Gronkowski that he is chalked up as a 12-1 chance on the morning line. By contrast, bookmakers in Britain are offering him at 33-1. Here he is at Newcastle: Hofburg, who is owned by Prince Khalid Abullah\u2019s Juddmonte Farms, was behind Justify in the Kentucky Derby, and also finished second in the Florida Derby at the end of March: But while Justify pretty much won the Derby as he pleased, he had to work a good deal harder at Pimlico. Bravazo, for one, was closing him down rapidly on the run to the wire, while Tenfold, another of tonight\u2019s opponents, was also in close attendance. Justify\u2019s best qualities- his stride, attitude and battling spirit - got him over the line, but he did not exactly look like a horse crying out for another quarter-mile. And the step up from around a mile-and-a-quarter to a full 12 furlongs is not the only question mark against Justify this evening. The Preakness was the fifth race of his career, and all five have come in the last three-and-three-quarter months following his debut in a maiden event at Santa Anita on 18 February. He had a prolonged duel for the lead with Good Magic, and will not get an easy time of it later from opponents whose riders are well aware that both stamina and general race-weariness could be big issues for the favourite. The demands inherent in contesting three major races in the course of just five weeks are, of course, part of the challenge and among the many reasons why the Triple Crown has proved so elusive over the years. Justify needs to raise his game once again and produce his best form, or something very close to it, if he is to win tonight, and those lining up against him not only include runners who are likely to improve for the trip but also those \u2013 including Hofburg, the second-favourite \u2013 who skipped the Preakness and could show the benefit of a five-week break today. In fact, both legs of the Triple Crown to date have been run in miserable weather - the Kentucky Derby, in fact, was apparently the first ever when it actually rained during the race. Here it is: There\u2019s really only one place to start the buildup to the Belmont, and that\u2019s a look back at the first two races in the Triple Crown: the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. Of the two, the Preakness is possibly more interesting than the Derby when it comes to assessing Justify\u2019s chance in the Belmont. It is also the most recent piece for form for three of tonight\u2019s runners in all, and so it is a little unfortunate that the conditions were so awful in Baltimore three weeks ago that it is quite difficult to see anything at all at several points in the race. See what you can glean from this: Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes in New York, a race that will be watched live by a sell-out crowd of 90,000 fans crammed in to Belmont Park and followed by millions more across the US and around the globe, as Justify attempts to become only the 13th horse in US racing history to win the Triple Crown. On an annual basis, the wider American sporting public\u2019s interest in horse racing tends to begin and end with the Kentucky Derby on the first weekend in May, but they wake up, turn on and tune in once again in early June if the Derby winner takes the Preakness at Pimlico a fortnight later and then makes it to the gate for the Belmont. It happens, on a rough average, about one year in every four, and there were no fewer than 13 disappointments spread out over the course of a famous 37-year drought before American Pharoah completed the set three years ago, to claim the first Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978. Justify is the first Kentucky Derby winner since to follow up in the Preakness, and faces nine opponents tonight in a race where one more victory would elevate him to legendary status. Post time for the Belmont is 23.46 BST, and the weather forecast in New York is for temperatures to still be in the mid-20s as the runners go to the start at around 6.40pm local time. Unlike the first two legs of the Triple Crown, there is little or no chance of any rain so Mike Smith should have a fast track to work with as he sets out to plot a winning path around Belmont Park from stall one. It could be one of the outstanding moments in American racing over the last few decades, or it could be another bitter disappointment. Whichever way it goes, you can follow all the build-up to the 150th Belmont Stakes and Justify\u2019s two-and-a-half minute run for glory here.
