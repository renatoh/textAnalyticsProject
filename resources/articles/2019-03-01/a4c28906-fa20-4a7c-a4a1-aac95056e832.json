It leaks across public life", "bodyText": "On Friday morning, as the news from Christchurch was still rolling across radio bulletins, Sir Mark Rowley, the former head of counter-terrorism at the Met, was commenting on the horror on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Fifty Muslims had been brutally murdered, and 48 seriously injured. For 17 horrifying minutes, a white supremacist terrorist unloaded round after round of bullets into men, women and children. Islamophobia was undoubtedly real and on the rise and being propagated online, said Rowley. But, he went on to quibble, Islamophobia wasn\u2019t racism. To conflate the two was, he claimed, \u201cclumsy thinking\u201d. The remark was treated as a random aside, made off the cuff, and left entirely unchallenged. Why? Because, it would seem, even on a morning when we\u2019re reeling, devastated and trying to process terrorist violence in mosques, it is fair game to diminish the lived reality of Muslims. Which isn\u2019t me being dramatic; it is simply a fact. Islamophobia is racism: it\u2019s not a coincidence that the majority of Muslims are not white and have roots in formerly colonised countries. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that racist stereotypes abound to the point where you don\u2019t even have to be a Muslim to be attacked as one (just ask a Sikh navigating the world post-9/11). Islamophobia does not simply exist on the unpalatable mass of the internet. It\u2019s not the preserve of rightwing extremists whom we write off as online nutters. It leaks across public life, in our institutions and our media, to form a pernicious feedback loop and almost nobody cares. If in doubt, consider the lonely figure cut by Sayeeda Warsi, whose calls for an inquiry into the documented Islamophobia within the Conservative party are blithely ignored by government. Remember a referendum campaign won on lies, fear-mongering about mass immigration from refugees, from Turkey, from anyone with \u201ca funny tinge\u201d. Bear in mind the dogged work of Miqdaad Versi, of the Muslim Council of Britain, politely lodging complaints against thousands of Islamophobic stories in the press, often upheld by the Independent Press Standards Organisation, and barely anyone batting an eyelid. Given the hysterical state of national debate, it is either disingenuous or profoundly stupid to claim that the daily drip-feed of Islamophobia, which is now so normalised in Britain as to be hardly remarkable, doesn\u2019t significantly shape the way Muslims are perceived and treated. Words matter. So do images. It\u2019s not for nothing that the atrocity in Christchurch was preceded by a 74-page manifesto published online and then streamed on Facebook Live. If a white supremacist can understand this power, it\u2019s not beyond the editor who chose to publish a picture of him as a toddler on its front page, rather than using that space to humanise his victims. It certainly can\u2019t escape the commentators who have made their bread and butter demonising and dehumanising Muslims and are expressing shock and grief at how their bile manifests in the real world. Both the Daily Mail and the Mirror chose to gorge on the terrorist\u2019s brutality, and broadcast his footage to their audience until they were shamed into removing it. This callous lack of humanity simply would never occur were the victims not Muslim and their lives already so othered, so seemingly disposable and without value. How did this angelic little boy grow up to be a mass killer, asks the Mirror. What did his grandmother think of her \u201cgood boy\u201d grandson, probes the Daily Mail. Frankly, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to glorify his name. I\u2019m not yet ready for Newsnight choosing to give a platform to a white fascist to discuss the massacre, under the hollow pursuit of free speech. It\u2019s an exhausted cliche to point out the hypocritical differences in the way the Christchurch terrorist is being covered by our press and what we learned about, say, the killers of the British soldier Lee Rigby. Or the 7/7 bombers. While it is, of course, a legitimate journalistic endeavour to understand how and why the gunman did what he did, humanising a mass murderer desperate for notoriety should not be the main focus of our attention. If he weren\u2019t an angry white man, it wouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s not too much to ask that care and empathy be focused on the victims. Their families. Their lives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
