They may have lost their captain for a while, though. Brian O'Driscoll has a suspected broken jaw. The Pumas had a series of five-metre scrums early in the game that had the potential to earn them a penalty try but once that siege had been lifted Ireland kept the scoreboard ticking over thanks to the unerring boot of Jonny Sexton. Argentina's captain and fly-half, Felipe Contepomi, had the opposite experience. The former Leinster player left nine points behind him in the first half. Limited sides cannot afford that sort of leakage and Argentina were 19-3 behind at the break. \"It's hard when you chase a team from nearly 20 points behind,\" Contepomi said. After an encouraging display against the All Blacks, Ireland followed up here with plenty of enterprise. Sean Cronin featured in much of it. Declan Kidney has not used this series as he might have done to build his squad and you wonder how much game time the Connacht hooker would have been given had Ulster's Rory Best been fit. Cronin has real dynamism. So has the Ulster flanker Stephen Ferris, who carried aggressively and scored the first of Ireland's two tries after 20 minutes. Their second came with the last play of the game and it was scored by the excellent Leinster centre Gordon D'Arcy.
