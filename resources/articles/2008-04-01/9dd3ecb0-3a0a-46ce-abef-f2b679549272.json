Saints have never lost four consecutive Super League matches and Daniel Anderson's side rarely looked likely to set an unwanted new record. With Pryce, Sean Long and Jon Wilkin in imperious form, they constantly caused problems for a Quins side that fell some way below the standards that had seen them rise to fifth place in the table. Paul Sculthorpe was making his latest comeback from injury, having missed the last six weeks with a hamstring problem, but it was the stand-off Pryce who took centre stage in the first half. Pryce was immersed in the action throughout and crossed twice before the interval as Saints threatened to cut loose at times. His half-back partner Long opened the scoring after less than five minutes as Harlequins' usually resolute defence proved worryingly brittle during the opening stages. Pryce then stepped inside Henry Paul and Jon Wells to score his first, before being involved in a neat scrum move that ended with the winger Francis Meli diving over from close range. Pryce also handled in the movement that saw James Roby plunge over, before scoring the try of the half on 33 minutes. Taking the ball from a standing start, the Great Britain stand-off beat five defenders on a brilliant individual run to the line. Either side of Pryce's second effort, Quins crossed for tries that suggested they could find an unlikely way back into the contest. The robust prop Gareth Haggerty barged his way over close to the posts, before Paul and Rob Purdham linked superbly to send Matt Gafa in for his ninth Super League try of the season. The visitors' defence improved markedly after the restart but the poor handling that had dogged their first-half performance continued in the second. It was one such error that gifted St Helens the opportunity for their fifth try, as they produced another set move from a scrum. This time the excellent Wilkin broke from the base of the scrum, and found the ever-supporting Paul Wellens on his right shoulder. Saints moved further ahead on the hour mark when typically smart handling resulted in Matt Gidley sending Ade Gardner over in the right-hand corner. That score signalled a procession of St Helens tries in the one-sided closing quarter as Pryce completed his hat-trick following a 50-metre Wilkin run, and Gidley and Gardner added further efforts to complete a forgettable night for the Londoners.
