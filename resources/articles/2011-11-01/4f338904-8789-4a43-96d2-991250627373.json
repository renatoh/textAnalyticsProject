It's OK, Ant and Dec are back to grin and waggle their eyebrows, reassuring us in an instant that it's fine to make a celebrity eat koala privates because it's only a bit of fun. And for those of you already dialing the number to force Mark Wright into a locked box with several hundred rats, you know who you are, can you please wait until the end of the show when the lines actually open. For anyone over 35 the selection of celebs is particularly gratifying this year with several faces last seen on those 1980s TVs with the plastic mahogany surrounds and big silver buttons you actually had to cross the room and press to change channels. Stefanie Powers from Hart to Hart (she's gaw-juss) leads the retro charge accompanied by multiple medal-winning superwoman Fatima Whitbread, Lorraine Chase from the Campari adverts and ex-jockey Willie Carson. All that's missing is Frank Bough, one of Benny Hill's angels and Hamble from Playschool. Settle into your most comfortable soft furnishings, feast on expensive pat\u00e9 and enjoy with me the blue-faced terror of some perfectly nice people who we, for no reason at all, wish beastly things upon. Hooray! 8.59pm: Who wants to go to the jungle to torture celebrities? You do? Well put on your khaki hats and come with me! Obviously we mean torture in a caring way. 9.02pm: Stacey Solomon is back in some rather more glam ad bumpers. Isn't she lovely? I love her a bit. OK, and we're straight in. Do NOT cross Fatima. Antony is up for anything. And there are helicopters. Everyone looks nauseous and/or terrified. It's already super! 9.04pm: Wow, they really show you a lot of the show before you actually watch it now, don't they. Please, don't tell us who wins. Keep something for later. And there's the traditional shot of Ant and Dec screaming on a bridge. We're off! 9.05pm: For those of you who don't know, there's already been a bit of bother with Freddie which we'll see more of in a minute. Basically he's an unpredictable comedian of yesteryear who shows no signs of slowing down in his 60s. He will, without doubt make excellent TV. He is now, safely in camp with the other celebrities. 9.07pm: It's time for the awkward first meetings, always enjoyable for the US stars being ever so polite when they see that every single one of their camp mates is a nobody in the States. They might as well be bus drivers to Stefanie from Hart to Hart. Antony is first in with the aforementioned Stef. They have cocktails and a Antony's honesty to break the ice. Nice work, Cotton. 9.09pm: Here comes Mark Wright from TOWIE. He's beautifully groomed and famously single since his split from one of the Laurens, I forget which. He is biding his time until \"the bikini one\" arrives. Lorraine Chase makes a nice entrance and by gosh she's beautiful. Now is not the time to tell you about my Chase-branded Girls World head or the time I went to see her in panto. LOVE her. 9.10pm: Jessica-Jane got teary thinking about her dogs. Safe to say Mark is also thinking very seriously about her puppies. Nice to see Dougie from McFly has kept it casual except for that enormous quiff. I wonder what happens to it in humid conditions? Fatima seems very much like someone who won't tolerate nonsense. I kind of wish Liz Jones had agreed to go into the jungle now. Fatima would have made mincemeat of her. 9.12pm: Crissy has made little impression on me thus far but seems friendly. Willie has changed little since his glory days on Question of Sport. I like him instantly. This probably means he will turn into a monster on day 3. 9.14pm: And now it's time for their last supper, the final taste of luxury before the bug casseroles and crocodile trifle. And here come Ant and Dec on a boat powered by the sheer force of their combined charisma. The music has turned sinister and two helicopters appear on the horizon. Shouldn't it be The Ride of the Valkyries for this bit? Urk, Crissy is already making jokes about Scouse stereotypes to make the others uncomfortable. Smashing stuff. 9.16pm: Fatima is totally the Navratilova this year in that she can reel off a list of achievements longer than a marathon and most of the others can just say, \"I posed for some pictures.\" or \"I'm on that sitcom.\" They are slomo walking towards the choppers in their pristine cotton separates. Blimey I hope Dougie ducked sufficiently to keep his quiff out of the rotor blades. 9.18pm: From up in the sky, the jungle looks so lovely. All green and peaceful and not at all the kind of place where you might find yourself screaming hysterically into camera, \"GET ME OUT OF HERE I WANT TO DIE.\" Naughty deceptive jungle. I can't help feeling Stacey's festive Iceland bumpers are a jumping the gun just a tad. I'm all for Christmas but if she starts driving home for Christmas now she'll have to go really, really slowly. 9.22pm: Still no sign of Freddie. I like to imagine he's crouched in the undergrowth, mud smeared in rough stripes on his face, twitching madly and making animal noises in a bid to confuse the crew. Meanwhile, his fellow celebs are struggling with a map that looks like a child drew it. Come on fellas, it's getting dark and there's a Starr on the loose. 9.25pm: Dougie's quiff has already given in to the humidity. Did he just say the cave smells like \"dead-end sex\"? Oh! Dead insects. Sorry. Must book in for a syringing. Fatima has already hacked down half a dozen trees and fashioned fully-sprung orthopedic beds for her camp mates while the men just stood around inspecting their fingernails. She already completely rules. And we've got ourselves a sleep-talker. This should liven up the nights where not much is happening. Without wishing to take my Dougie's hair obsession to ridiculous levels, it looks great now it's gone all wild and free. Like you could run your fingers through it and find little creatures making a nest. 9.29pm: Great, so Fatima went to all that trouble making lovely beds and now they're being needlessly taken back up into the sky and flung to their possible doom. Crissy is smoking furiously and poor old Cotton is paralysed with fear at the thought of jumping as any normal human should be. Anyone who willingly hurls themselves into thin air with a big hanky tied to their back needs actual help. What is WRONG with everyone? 9.32pm: Mark has opted for a Rambo-style bandana which contrasts nicely with his total lack of bravery and/or toughness. Crissy has put her false teeth in a bag for later so she doesn't lose them at 10,000 feet. Fatima is unbothered by such weakling emotions and is high-fiving anyone in a 1 metre radius. There they go, plummeting to earth. Why aren't they screaming? I would scream continuously, stopping only occasionally to pray and/or puke. It was very polite of Lorraine to leave her puking until she could duck behind a convenient bush. Mark is screaming, \"No no no,\" like a girl, which is gratifying. I'm imagining his ex-girlfriend taping this bit and replaying at the times she misses him. Why is he sticking his tongue out? Is he tasting the air like an animal? 9.33pm: \"I feel like I've achieved something,\" says Mark. This is a first for him. A big moment for the lad. 9.37pm: And the Ant and Dec banter is back. They love a good giggle, don't they? With their near the knuckle insinuations and cute little looks to camera. \"I do like my Willie,\" says Jessica-Jane, setting the Carry On tone for the rest of her stay in the jungle. I wonder, I do really wonder, if she has perhaps packed a bikini for those all-important jungle showers. Maybe a few different ones? These boats look really hard to row, don't they? Like paddling one of the obstacles on Total Wipeout. They just refuse to stay upright which is very funny isn't it? When you think about it. 9.41pm: Stefanie could cheer up a bit, couldn't she? Come on, Stef. Relax, warm to our quaint British humour and crack a smile before the next ad break or you'll be first for the trials. Actually what am I saying? A million women are poised by their phones as we speak, waiting for the lines to open so they can send Mark's Romford behind down some dread tunnel teeming with eel/lizard/rat hybrids with poisonous fangs. And that's just for starters. Who do you like so far? I hesitate to say, \"I like Willie.\" But I do! 9.45pm: It's the dramatic drum music, incessantly reminding us that parachute jumps are terrifying. We know they're terrifying. That's why we don't do them. Fatima just blew the camera a kiss. She's made of actual nails, melted down and formed into a tightly honed killing machine. I'm not saying she's actually killed a man. But, you know, I reckon she could. With one of her fingers. Without even noticing. Cotton's next. His silent scream in profile reminded me of Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. His face stretched so tightly into the shriek of terror, his nose disappeared altogether. Big props to the lad for actually doing that parachute jump. It's not very British to say, \"I was brave to do that.\" though. The public won't like that. That was very Kitty's first audition, sitting on the edge of the stage, Cotton. Watch yourself. 9.49pm: Crissy is the only sensible one in that she bottled the jump. Oh yes, the laughter has stopped now she's on the ground and her teeth are goodness knows where. Has anyone actually had their teeth delivered back to them by chopper before? I bet even Elton John wouldn't be that extravagant. Poor Lorraine is spewing like a geyser. Is it fear or a dodgy prawn at yesterday's banquet? 9.53pm: The bushtucker trial music with that haunting whistle/didgeridoo noise always makes me want a mini quiche. Hidden messages implanted in the programme by a certain sponsor? I'm on to you, frozen food retailer. Oh my goodness, it's Freddie. Where has he been? Someone must tell us. Will there be a spin-off show to explain his absense? It'll be like Apocalypse Now but with more laughs. Or possibly fewer if Starr's last Channel 4 documentary is anything to go by. 9.55pm: They literally aren't going to tell us what happened to Freddie. It must've been bad. This is beyond intriguing. I am studying every close-up of him for traces of his lost hours. I can't believe they're not going to tell us! And the first nasty twist is that the losing team of this first challenge will be going swimming in fish guts. Mmmmm... fish guts. Poor Lorraine looks beside herself with worry. I really love it when the celebs say things like, \"I don't like cockroaches\" or \"I can't swim.\" Seriously, how badly did you want the primetime exposure that you'd do this show taking into account the things you can't/won't do? Pfft. They really didn't think it through. 9.59pm: You know if Lauren thingy from TOWIE could make that platform tip into the fish guts just with her mind, she would. She's trying to do it right now, veins throbbing in her forehead with the effort. 10.02pm: Nice to see Ant and Dec have normal-sized poppies. I don't hold with these satellite dish jobs, covered in glitter. It's not very \"war\" is it? Back to the gross-out trial of all our dreams. Lorraine gets in there, despite her nausea. Freddie is mostly mute but surprisingly compliant so far. Has Crissy taken her teeth out for this one? Freddie looks like he's french-kissing that tub of maggots when filmed from above. What a lovely image. \"We're finished,\" mutters Stefanie. That's the spirit, Powers. Never give up. Fatima's going straight for those eels without a moment's hesitation. She gives one of the eels a telling off for splashing her. Do. Not. Mess. And the yellow team have won it. Bye bye, blues. Smell you later. 10.04pm: While the blues are marinading, the yellows are off to Croc Creek. Weeee, that flying fish innard hit Cotton right on the bonce. Nice aim, Dougie from McFly. That could come in handy later in the competition. 10.07pm: OK ladies, this is what you've been waiting for. The first trial is a head-to-head grossness eating contest. You know what to do. I wonder who the public will choose to go up against Mark? Didn't you get Mark's number by the way? The yellows arrive at camp to find an idyllic scene. Proper beds, a roaring fire and clean bedding. While most of them seem genuinely pleased to be there, Mark looks like he's waiting for the director to yell cut and ask him to do the \"looking pleased at the nice new camp\" bit again but with a bit more feeling. He looks like he's finding the whole \"continuous take\" thing a bit hard to cope with. 10.10pm: Is Freddie about to tell everyone where he's been? No. Of course he'll be all right with rice and beans, he's been living it up in a clearing for two days, feasting on bats and making himself the kind of the lizards. And he's already making himself unpopular. I wondered how long that would take. You can't pick a fight with Willie and expect to win. He's to nice. 10.12pm: It sounds like, thanks to that helpful teaser (stop showing me the programme before it happens, just stop) that Crissy is going to be doing stand-up for as long as she's got the energy. That's not going to get enervating. Not at all. And Freddie puts those hamster rumours to bed. He must love being asked about that hamster. Did you know the hamster which he didn't eat was called Supersonic. Little bit of trivia for you. Save it up for a pub quiz. You're welcome. 10.15pm: Thanks to tipatina for this. I think we have the star of tonight's show. crissy's teeth to win it 10.17pm: Freddie is already making the cardinal mistake of confusing self-pity with likeability. Mooning around with a face like a disappointed Pat Butcher will not stop folk ringing up for you to the trials. That little sequence alone will send the switchboard into meltdown. Did he learn nothing from McKeith? Hmmm, Jessica-Jane really likes Freddie and has \"a lot of time for him\". I am instantly suspicious. Why, J-J? Why? 10.21pm: Here's that hamster story again, one more time for the people at the back. So there was this hamster, right. I knew Max Clifford had to be involved somewhere along the line. I suspect this is not the last time we will hear Freddie trot out his Beatles stories. Or the \"fact\" he likes dressing in women's clothes. He's invented an alter-ego for himself called Thelma who will presumably come out every time Freddie starts to annoy his camp mates. \"No, I'm not Freddie, I'm Thelma.\" *mad eyes* He's storing all this exposition up for some fascinating role plays later in the series. I can just tell. And it's working. He's had the most camera time since his arrival. Clever Freddie. 10.25pm: We're nearly there. It's almost time for the announcement of the first unfortunates to eat dingo dong... 10.28pm: But first the winning team are rewarded with their first night's dinner. Stefanie the vegetarian is carping about the tucker already. They've even provided tofu for her but she's cross about the lack of a marinade. I'm sure they haven't chucked out the fish guts juice if she doesn't mind going a bit off-menu. Crissy is literally doing stand-up for her captive audience. She does seem nice. But also a bit like the kind of person who'd stop you in the supermarket and bore you tears with the amusing thing that happened to her that morning. Her place on the Loose Women panel is assured. 10.29pm: And now for the first trial. In the firing line are Cotton and Mark. Crissy's teeth are safe. Predictably Mark is up. But who will face him in that hellish diner? Could it be, ooh, I dunno, Freddie? It'll be Freddie. Definitely Freddie. It's Freddie. 10.32pm: One and a half hours into the new series and the two obvious villains have emerged, Starr and Wright. But I think Stefanie's not going to be far behind them if she doesn't stop whinging. I predict a rough ride for Freddie throughout but Mark may have the chance to win us round if he drops the smirk and gets with the convincing humility. Top first night but I'm still BURNING to know what happened with Freddie. Thanks for your company this evening. I'll be floating about on Twitter (at @jnraeside) for the rest of the series, spouting my ill-informed bile for all to see so maybe I'll see you there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
