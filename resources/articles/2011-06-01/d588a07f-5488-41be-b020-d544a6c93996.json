Image: Marie Louise Ng, 9 October 2010 [velociraptorize]. Nikon D3S 500mm/F4 Question: This gorgeous Chinese mystery bird possesses several characters that unite all the members of this genus, and it possesses one character that sets it apart from its congeners. Can you name any of these characters? Response: This is a black-capped kingfisher, Halcyon pileata, a species whose genus name was derived from a Greek myth about a woman named Alcyone. Daughter of Aeolus, the ruler of the winds, she was married to Ceyx, the king of Thessaly. One day, news reached her that Ceyx had drowned at sea, so in despair, Alcyone threw herself into the sea to join him in his watery grave. But instead of drowning, the winds carried her to her spouse. Ovid transcribed this myth as follows: The Gods their shapes to winter-birds translate, But both obnoxious to their former fate. Their conjugal affection still is ty'd, And still the mournful race is multiply'd: They bill, they tread; Alcyone compress'd, Sev'n days sits brooding on her floating nest: A wintry queen: her sire at length is kind, Calms ev'ry storm, and hushes ev'ry wind; Prepares his empire for his daughter's ease, And for his hatching nephews smooths the seas. ~ Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book the Eleventh. It was thought that kingfishers were the birds described by this myth. Further, it was thought that kingfishers could calm the sea for the seven days before and seven days after the winter solstice so they could nest on the sea's surface. For this reason, \"Halcyon days\" refer to peace or calm. Kingfishers are all classified into the family Halcyonidae. The Halcyon kingfishers, or tree kingfishers, tend to be large birds with heavy bills. They are found in a variety of habitats, although woodlands are preferred by most species. (If you enjoyed that story about Alcyone, then you might be interested to know that the river kingfishers are placed into the genus Ceyx.) All kingfishers are \"sit and wait\" predators that pounce on their prey, which consists of small ground animals including large insects, rodents, snakes, and frogs, but some will also prey on fish. Contrary to mythology (and their name), most kingfisher species are not closely tied to water. However, black-capped kingfishers are different from their congeners because they occur in mangroves, where they mainly pounce on fish.
