Spurs have work to do to guarantee a place in the top four, a job that continues at Brighton on Tuesday night, before the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United on Saturday. Pochettino is also still chewing over the performance that enabled City to ease to a 3-1 win at Wembley last Saturday. He believes elements of that display showed Spurs can compete but that his team must start next season strongly if they are to have a hope of becoming champions. \u201cI want to congratulate Pep, the coaching staff and of course the players \u2013 they deserve the title,\u201d he said. \u201cIn football, after a whole season, it is the most consistent side that has the capacity to win. \u201c[On Saturday] when we reached our real levels we showed we can compete with Manchester City. But to be consistent over the entire season is the challenge for us. \u201cIf we want to win and challenge for big things, we need to start from day one in pre-season. If you analyse how we started the last three seasons, they began after four, five or 10 games. That is a thing to improve. We are going to be focused on starting better.\u201d One of the factors that has impeded Spurs\u2019 starts in previous seasons has been recruitment, with the club often completing deals in the final weeks of the transfer window. This summer the transfer window will close as the season begins, but with a World Cup also in the offing Pochettino feels they will have to act earlier. \u201cIt is so dangerous to go and scout players in the World Cup. If a player plays well you will have a lot of competition and how are you going to sign him? Sometimes you need to anticipate, to think, \u2018OK, this player can be good for us\u2019, but you need to sign [him] before the tournament starts. We are thinking and trying to anticipate because it will be difficult if not. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about money in football, that is true. But it helps. As a coach you can have ideas about football but then you need the principal actors to deliver this idea. We are competing in a different way to Manchester City. At Tottenham we have to be brave, to believe, to work harder than other clubs that are at our level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
