The 26-year old Quinnell, who has won 32 Wales caps, will join Saracens next season on a four-year contract worth \u00a3500,000, \u00a3100,000 more than Wales's richest club Cardiff were able to offer, and he will be joined at Vicarage Road by the France prop Christian Califano and the Fiji fly-half Nicky Little, from Auckland Blues and Pontypridd respectively. The Cardiff and Wales scrum-half Rob Howley, who turned down the chance to join Leicester two years ago, believes that unless the 239 Welsh Rugby Union member clubs agree to a radical change in the way the game in Wales is run when they meet in Cardiff next month Quinnell will be the first of many players to move to England. \"Craig's loss will be a big blow to Cardiff and to Welsh rugby as a whole,\" said Howley, who yesterday learned that the ligament damage in his right knee suffered during the league match against Caerphilly at the Arms Park on Wednesday night will keep him out of action for the rest of the season. \"I hope that it does not start an exodus from Wales, but there is uncertainty surrounding the professional game with club backers reluctant to invest until next month's meeting is held and as a player financial stability is important. \"What could be significant is that Craig spoke to [the Wales coach] Steve Hansen before making his decision and he was told that playing in England would not jeopardise his chances of playing for Wales. \"Steve's predecessor Graham Henry was totally different. He encouraged players to return to Wales from England by saying it would enhance their chances of playing international rugby but Steve's view is that he does not mind where players are earning their livings as long as they are playing in a strong tournament. \"There is clearly more money in England but I hope that clubs are able to persuade players to stay here because the last thing we need is for our league to be devalued.\" While Quinnell is changing clubs the Sale director of rugby Jim Mallinder yesterday signed a two-year extension to his contract. The Heywood Road club are fourth in the Premiership and take on Gloucester in the Parker Pen Shield semi-final a week tomorrow. Quinnell's arrival at Saracens is expected to coincide with the departure of the Scotland second-row Scott Murray to Sale, who earlier this week persuaded the Scotland scrum-half and captain Bryan Redpath, who had attracted the interest of the champions Leicester, to remain with them. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
