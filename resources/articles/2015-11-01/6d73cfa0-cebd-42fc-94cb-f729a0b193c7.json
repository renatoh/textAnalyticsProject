The Leicester City striker, the Premier League\u2019s top scorer, has played on the left in the two internationals he has started for his country. His run of goals in the Premier League has led to calls for him to start in the middle for England, but Hodgson was quick to state that Vardy should be pleased to make the squad for the upcoming friendlies against Spain and France regardless of where he plays. The manager, unveiling a squad that includes the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eric Dier for the first time, said: \u201cI think Jamie Vardy can play in any of the front three positions. Jamie has only played a couple of games from the start, he should be happy at the moment a) to be in the squad and b) even happier if he makes the team.\u201d Leicester\u2019s goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel is among those to have said Vardy, who has scored 11 goals this season, has earned an opportunity to start as a central striker. \u201cHe definitely deserves his chance to play for England down the middle and not on the left like he has been doing,\u201d Schmeichel said. \u201cHe drags us through and sets the tone every single game. When you have a player like that, he is a dream to play with.\u201d But Hodgson said Vardy, who has four caps, should attempt to succeed wherever he is chosen to play. \u201cHis job I think should be definitely to try and convince that he has got the ability to play as a forward in an England team and not get too hung up like some people if he only plays \u2018here\u2019,\u201d he said. The England manager, without nine potential squad members through injury, said he picked his side based on ability not on what \u201cthe mass media or social media say\u201d. He added: \u201cI am just trying as I sometimes try to do, always unsuccessfully, to defuse hype and to make one very important point, which is very, very obvious that an England shirt is a very valuable commodity. \u201cWhen you have only played two games you are in no position to go to the coach and say: \u2018I will play for England but only in this position.\u2019 That is the point I am trying to make.\u201d Alongside the captain Wayne Rooney and the Spurs centre-forward Harry Kane, Vardy is one of only three recognised strikers in the squad for the matches in Spain on Friday 13 November and at Wembley against France the following Tuesday. Hodgson also paid tribute to the 21-year-old Dier, who has been selected as a defensive midfielder after impressing in that position for Spurs this season. \u201cWe do need someone that can support Michael Carrick or cover Michael Carrick and I think looking at the Premier League at the moment, Eric is a player who interests me most, especially in terms of his future development,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cHe is a central defender who is capable of stepping forward and doing a good defensive job in the centre of midfield to allow other players around him to maybe show off their more extravagant talents.\u201d Dier\u2019s club-mate Dele Alli, who made his debut in September, is also included rather than dropping back to the Under-21s. Hodgson hailed Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham head coach, for trusting young English talent. \u201cOne thing they\u2019re definitely doing is that when they get talented players coming through their academy they give them a chance and put them in the first team and they\u2019re prepared to accept that the players they\u2019re putting in won\u2019t have the experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way you can get the experience is by playing and you will never be an experienced player if you don\u2019t get the chance to play games.\u201d Hodgson also expanded on his plan for the side to play games on the road in the run up to the European Championships in an attempt to connect with fans around the country. The idea is still at an early stage and has yet to be signed off but is likely to involve playing at least one match in the north before returning to Wembley for the final friendly before the tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous thing to talk about because it\u2019s embryonic,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cBut I will give you two very obvious advantages. It will give a lot of people in England, around the country who don\u2019t get a chance to get to Wembley the chance to see us play. \u201cAnd the chance to interact with some of the communities, possibly the schools, local youth clubs, maybe invite them to watch us train, a simple thing like that. I would like to take England to an audience that maybe only otherwise get to see us on television.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
