The Federal Reserve thinks strong growth and the lowest unemployment since the days when the US was putting men on the moon warrants a gradual increase in interest rates. Trump has been telling the Fed to stop before it craters the economy. In the end, the Fed on Wednesday did what it was always going to do: it went ahead with the planned rate rise. The Fed seems relaxed about the state of the US economy. Its preferred measure of inflation has been falling, not rising, and there was nothing in the statement put out by the Fed to suggest it was unsettled by plunging share prices, even though the stock market is on course for its worst December since 1931. Wall Street sees trouble ahead for the world\u2019s biggest economy in 2019 and it is right to be worried. The impact of tax cuts is fading, the trade war with China is far from over and higher interest rates will start to bite. The one sop to the White House was a scaling back from three to two in the number of rate rises currently seen to be needed next year. But the financial markets were already assuming this anyway, so there was no jumping for joy on Wall Street when the news broke. If, as seems likely, the Fed turns more dovish over the coming months, Trump will revel in his triumph. The president needs a fall guy to take the blame when the economy weakens over the next year and he has one in the form of Jerome Powell, the man he regrets choosing to run the Fed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
