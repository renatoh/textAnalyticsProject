Yet, even as the Royal marks his 80th anniversary, this triple bill shows how elusive MacMillan's choreographic identity remains. Concerto (1966) is the easiest of the three ballets to access. Its first and third movements bear the mark of George Balanchine in their pumped-up geometric formations and their fleet, leggy virtuosity. It's in the mysteries of the slow middle movement that you catch vivid sight of MacMillan. The ecstatically modulated lyricism of its pas de deux seems to harness all the passion that took him from working-class teenager to the top of ballet. A sense of vocation drives the piece, and Marianela N\u00fa\u00f1ez, shaping every move to catch it, is both ballerina acolyte and goddess. The woman in Judas Tree (1992) gets a brutally different treatment. Charged with representing both Mary Magdalene and Mary mother of god, she is the whore who goads Judas (here the foreman of a building site) to incite his crew to punitive gang rape and murder his innocent Jesus-figure friend. Admirers hail it a brave voyage into the darkness. Despite some harrowing invention in its choreography, the narrative is muddled and its vicious misogyny remains fatally unexamined. Even party ballet Elite Syncopations, MacMillan's 1974 setting of Scott Joplin rags, has an acidic aftertaste: the girls simper and the men strut with an unnerving edge of desperation. But Sarah Lamb is fabulous in the central role: sexy, assured and fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
