He is understood to have boarded a British transport plane that flew out of Baghdad this afternoon for Kuwait, and he is expected to return to London on a commercial flight some time tomorrow morning. The 74-year-old peace activist was rescued yesterday along with two Canadian colleagues in an operation carried out by SAS-led forces in one of the most dangerous parts of Baghdad. \"Norman has already left,\" Peggy Gish of Christian Peacemaker Teams told a news conference in Baghdad. She added that the Canadian hostages, Jim Loney and Harmeet Sooden, planned to leave tomorrow. She also gave a few more details about the hostages' time in captivity. \"Most of the time in captivity they were not bound and were able to walk around the compound in which they were being held,\" she said. \"They were bound a short time before the [rescue] forces came in.\" She said the three were still \"dedicated to the cause\" of helping Iraqis but she was uncertain whether they would decide to return to Iraq or carry out their work elsewhere. She said the peace organisation had received no contact from the kidnappers and no ransom demand was made. The hostages are not thought to have suffered any illness as a result of their ordeal, she added, and it was believed that the team holding Mr Kember provided him with medication for a pre-existing medical condition. Earlier, Mr Kember issued a brief statement through the British embassy. \"I have had the opportunity to have a shave, a relax in the bath and a good English breakfast,\" he said. \"I'm very much looking forward to getting home to British soil and to being reunited with my family.\" His wife, Pat, said last night she was \"thrilled\" at news of her husband's release. \"It's wonderful news - I was getting pessimistic, I was beginning to feel nothing was happening and I was getting worried,\" Mrs Kember told New Zealand's National Radio from the family's home in Pinner, north-west London. \"The support I have had from everybody has been so wonderful. In England, every church and denomination has been having vigils of prayer, and I cannot fault them.\" Special forces soldiers found Mr Kember tied up but apparently abandoned along with the two Canadians at a house in Baghdad yesterday morning. The three peace activists were released without a shot being fired or a sign of their kidnappers after 118 days in captivity. Mrs Kember said she had not expected her husband to be kidnapped when he told her he was going to Iraq. \"I thought when he wanted to go to Iraq he was a bit silly, but on the other hand I knew he felt he must do something, and he is getting old,\" she added. \"I thought he might be blown up by a bomb ... I did not really expect him to be taken hostage.\" The former Beirut hostage and negotiator Terry Waite today questioned the tactics of peacemakers going to Iraq, saying he applauded their motives but doubted their methods. \"I think the situation in Iraq is so vastly different to when I was negotiating 20 years ago,\" he told GMTV. \"It has become so much more polarised and anyone, any foreigner - particularly from the west, given the history of the west in Iraq in recent years - is exposed to very grave danger, not only for political reasons but for criminal reasons also.\" It emerged today that another member of Christian Peacemaker Teams, the group Mr Kember was with, was planning to return to Iraq. Jan Benvie, from Edinburgh, defended her right to go to Iraq against Foreign Office advice. \"We make it clear that if we are kidnapped, we do not want there to be force or any form of violence used to release us,\" she told GMTV. \"If the government or military commanders choose to do that, that is their responsibility.\" The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, refused to criticise Mr Kember's decision to go to Iraq. \"The advice we give is a matter of record, but I've not criticised Mr Kember for going to Iraq and I'm not going to,\" Mr Straw told BBC2's Newsnight. \"If you're asking me if a similar situation arose again would we follow our very clear obligation as the British government to help British citizens who are facing such a predicament, yes, of course we would.\" Mr Kember was seized with three colleagues - Canadians Jim Loney, 41, and 32-year-old Harmeet Singh Sooden, and an American, 54-year-old Tom Fox, during a peace mission to Baghdad on November 26. Mr Fox was found shot dead in the affluent Mansour district of Baghdad earlier this month. There were signs he had been beaten before being killed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
