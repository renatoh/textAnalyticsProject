In spite of Moat's death on Saturday morning, it is not done yet. Moat's body had scarcely been removed from the Northumbrian river bank where he took his own life before the questions began. Why had the police hunt taken so long? Why did the Tasers not do their job? How was the danger from Moat not acted upon sooner? The questions are fair. They are part of the reason why the Moat manhunt will now be examined by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. But it is also important, and not just with the benefit of hindsight, that larger questions raised by the operation do not escape attention either. The difficult but crucial central issue about the whole operation is whether it was proportionate to the threat posed. Granted, it is much easier to ask this question in retrospect than when the outcome of the hunt remained uncertain. Moat was manifestly a danger to his partner and to other members of the public. He was an armed killer on the loose. He had to be found and captured. Yet, even after he killed one man and wounded two others, was it absolutely inevitable that he should have been treated as though he was an indiscriminate and overwhelming threat to such a large area? There are no easy answers to such questions. No one wants to put the public at risk. But wanted killers have been on the run before and will be again. Catching them is always dangerous work. Overwhelmingly, however, the killers do not get away, even though the hunts have rarely, in the past, been on the scale of the one that was mobilised for Moat. Mostly, such operations do not get the accolade of repeated police press conferences, nonstop live television coverage and the scrambling of hundreds of fully armed officers from across many counties. At times the hunt for Moat became a bit of a circus. Was all of it necessary? The hunt for Moat was one of the first such operations to take place since Derrick Bird went on the rampage in Cumbria last month. Statistically and criminologically that case was an exceptional event. The Moat case \u2013 an angry violent man bent on harming his former girlfriend \u2013 seems to fit a more grimly familiar pattern. But it also seems possible that the Bird precedent shaped media, police and public reactions to the Moat case \u2013 and perhaps even shaped Moat's own attention-seeking behaviour \u2013 and that the response was ratcheted up on all fronts as a result. Both the media and the police need to think long and hard before allowing such cases to set new patterns of response which are not just disproportionate to the threat, but which may also contribute to the tragic outcomes they are intended to avoid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
