Was it the horse what done it? Or, Van Nistelrooy aside, maybe it was Kleberson? The diary knows better, however, and can confirm that the culprit is Terry's All Gold. \"Marcello Lippi gave me this massive box of chocolates to take home for the kids,\" Fergie said this week of his Juve coaching pal. \"I don't like to tell him but I ate half of them myself before I got home. Everyone's got one weakness in life and mine's chocolates.\" \u00b7You could be forgiven for thinking that footballing jaunts to Spain were out of favour. Not so, however, as Northampton announced their summer tour to Seville and invited supporters to accompany them. \"For those supporters who will be travelling, Seville is an excellent base,\" explained the assistant manager, and amateur travel agent, John Deehan. \"The city is split into two parts, with the modern part being where the team will be based. Over the other side of the river is the more historical part of Seville, and I certainly found that just as impressive.\" With that recommendation, how could you refuse? \u00b7The hard life of the modern footballer. Queens Park Rangers' Marc Bircham says opponents give him special attention because of his hairdo. \"I've been called the Nationwide Robbie Savage and I suppose my barnet's got a bit to do with it,\" he confessed this week. But whereas Savage has a simple long blond mane, Bircham wears his hair short, gelled into a crest and dyed both blond and blue. \"I have to do it once a month with the bleach so I don't know if my hair will start falling out soon,\" he revealed. \"I can't do spray in case it starts raining; I don't need it running down my face.\" \u00b7Welcome to the Hucknall Town corner. If you don't know by now, the Unibond League leaders, shunned by the Nottinghamshire press but loved by everyone else, earned a 2-1 win over Matlock Town in the League Cup last Saturday. The match was tight, a Gary Ricketts header cancelled out when Paul Pettinger's fumble let in Matlock. Something got Hucknall started again, however, and the tie was settled in the second half by the sizzling Danny Bacon. In other Hucknall news, Mick will be hosting An Audience with Alastair Campbell at Manchester's Bridgewater Hall on Tuesday night. \u00b7Sometimes you do have to wonder about the marketing profession. For example, it has been revealed that a \"research institute\" known as Emnid has been surveying European fans as to which haircut they like on their footballers. The survey found that Latin fans like Latin haircuts (such as Beckham's flowing locks) whereas the Germans like a nice short back and sides (say no more). Quite what benefit this will have for mankind is as yet uncertain, but it should at least be of some use to Marc Bircham: our survey says that only 16% of fans find dyed hair attractive. paul.macinnes@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
