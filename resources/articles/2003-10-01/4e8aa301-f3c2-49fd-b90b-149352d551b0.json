But when those 32 are whittled down to two, we can be sure of one thing: the finalists will come from one of only four leagues. It wasn't always like this. Teams of limited resources from small countries could win, or at least reach the final, in the days when it was simply a straight knock-out between genuine champions of domestic leagues. The last final of the old European Cup was in 1991 - and it was largely forgettable. It shouldn't have been that way. When Red Star Belgrade met Olympique Marseille, in the San Nicola stadium in Bari, Italy, it promised a match to savour. Both sides had outstanding attacking players. The Yugoslavs had Darko Pancev, Robert Prosinecki and Dejan Savicevic; the French had Jean-Pierre Papin, Abedi Pel\u00e9 and Chris Waddle. Both teams had played with great attacking flair on their way to the final. Yet, in Bari, Red Star, who had so brilliantly destroyed Bayern Munich in the semi-final, played for a goalless draw - and penalties. Coach Ljupko Petrovic was unrepentant: 'We realised we could not really beat Marseille unless they made a mistake, so I told my players to be patient and wait for penalties,' he said afterwards. 'We practised penalties a lot in our closed training session and it paid off.' Marseille were thus perhaps doomed from the moment Manuel Amoros placed a weak spot-kick within easy reach of Stevan Stojanovic. With the Yugoslavs demonstrating Germanic precision from 12 yards, they won the contest, 5-3. No one could begrudge Red Star their victory in what was a year of intensifying civil unrest in Yugoslavia. In Pancev, they possessed the continent's most prolific scorer, with 34 goals for his club. Five weeks after he had scored the decisive penalty kick, tanks rolled out of Belgrade, destined for Croatia; thoughts other than football occupied the minds of the people. Some say the conflict began the previous year at a match between Red Star and bitter rivals Dynamo Zagreb. The match was abandoned as the home Croatian supporters fought with their Serbian counterparts: the gifted Croat player Zvonimir Boban even launching a Cantona-like two-footed lunge on a policeman. As Yugoslavs saw the bloody scenes on television, the feeling was that war seemed inevitable. Red Star fans were soon swapping the terraces for the trenches as the country disintegrated. The president of Red Star's supporters club, Zeljko Raznatovic - more commonly know as Arkan - became the most hated of war lords and exploited the club's fan base to fill his Serbian Volunteer Guard military unit. War marked the end of the last great Red Star team. First, Prosinecki moved to Barcelona; then, a year later, Savicevic went to AC Milan, for whom he was to win the Champions League in 1994, and Pancev was sold to Internazionale for \u00a37 million, only to flounder as he scored just three times in 21 games. As a nation tore itself apart along ethnic and religious boundaries, so Red Star's team, built on the greatness of a Macedonian (Pancev), a Montenegrin (Savicevic), and a Croat (Prosinecki), was destroyed. Little more than a decade later it seems inconceivable that a team from eastern Europe will ever again be crowned champions of Europe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
