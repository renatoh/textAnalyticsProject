Having won the toss and chosen to bowl on a typically flat Taunton pitch he gave runs away like election promises as Somerset scored a formidable 344 for five in this semi-final. Kent, though, chased their outlandish target magnificently before a late swing gave Somerset a thrilling victory by five runs with five balls to spare. Taunton, after all, had proved to be a marginal constituency. In truth, Kent should have beaten the holders with some comfort. With 15 deliveries remaining they needed only nine runs with four wickets left and the very experienced Mark Ealham and Paul Nixon at the crease. Those two had already put on 74 for the seventh wicket and were bossing the game. But they lost their last four wickets in 10 balls for only three runs. Nixon was run out by Keith Dutch's direct hit from midwicket and James Golding was then run out by Simon Francis, substituting for Richard Johnson, who had a cramp attack on his way to the toilet. David Masters was then bowled, first ball, by Matthew Bulbeck. All this left a rather bewildered Ealham needing six from the last over with the last man Martin Saggers at the other end. From the first delivery, bowled by Steffan Jones, Ealham swung to midwicket where Dutch took a fine tumbling catch. Ealham, back in the side after being dropped for disciplinary reasons, almost carried off the man-of-the-match award, following a tight bowling spell with his 35-ball 36. But he was pipped by Ian Blackwell, whose muscular 86 from only 53 balls had been the fulcrum of the Somerset innings and who then took the pace off the ball when the Kent batsmen were running amok; Kent did not have a bowler to perform a similar function. So Somerset have beaten Kent en route to the final of this competition in 1999, 2001 and 2002. Kent must wait longer still for successes in a knockout competition, last tasted in 1978. Fleming commented: \"Whoever said it's not the winning but the taking part which is the important thing had never just lost a Cheltenham and Gloucester Trophy semi-final. \"I'm incredibly proud of the way we chased today but not so proud of the way we bowled and fielded. We should have won the game in the end. But the man-of-the-match award should have gone to the groundsman for producing such a wonderful pitch.\" Kent had paced their response perfectly and they were on the verge of setting a record in domestic one-day cricket for the highest winning score batting second. That remains the property of Sussex, who scored 329 for five to beat Derbyshire in Derby in 1997. Fleming, making up for his ordinary bowling, thrashed 63 from 48 balls with 10 fours as he and Robert Key put on a swift 100 for the first wicket. Key, eyeing an England place this weekend - and having worked in the futures market he probably knows more about his chances than anyone else - hit a vigorous 42 before he chopped on a Keith Parsons delivery. Kent maintained their pursuit thanks mainly to Andrew Symonds, who hit 55 from 41 balls, with two sixes and six fours, before he top-edged a sweep. When they needed 42 from seven and 17 from four the match was in their hands. It is unusual for Kent to choose to bowl first in these contests. Perhaps they were encouraged by the morning moisture. But they bowled too loosely to exploit it. There were also three dropped catches and some sloppy ground fielding. Somerset, though, batted wonderfully well. At the heart of their innings was a stand of 90 in 10 overs between Blackwell and Michael Burns (72) but Peter Bowler (70) was terrific before that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
