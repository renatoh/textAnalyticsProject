The BBC Springwatch presenter and naturalist will appear before magistrates on Thursday morning on the island of Gozo after being charged with \u201cattempting to use force\u201d and \u201cpushing against\u201d a Maltese man. Packham, who is making an independent film about Malta\u2019s spring hunt in which thousands of migrating birds are shot over the Mediterranean islands, had called the police after discovering a large cage of protected wild species, including goldfinch, moorhen, starlings and turtle doves. It is illegal to keep some of these birds in captivity. According to Packham, he and his producer Ruth Peacey and sound recordist Garry Moore were filming an interview on a public road when two men jumped out of a vehicle and \u201cstarted screaming and shouting and pushing\u201d. The police were present and \u201cimmediately took the side of the aggressors and manhandled Chris and other members of the team off the site\u201d, according to a statement released via Packham\u2019s agent. After being detained for more than three hours at a police station, Packham was charged. His production team are believed to have camera footage that may exonerate him. \u201cIt\u2019s intimidation and time-wasting. If they fine me it\u2019s just trying to thwart us,\u201d Packham told the Guardian. During a Facebook Live Q&amp;A session on Wednesday evening, broadcasting from the Maltese city of Mdina, he went into more detail about the incident that lead to the charges. \u201c[The man] had some birds in a cage \u2026 but by the time the police turned up, they\u2019d all mysteriously vanished. Weird that. And weird that he\u2019d given a list of these birds to police earlier in the day but he wasn\u2019t arrested, and he\u2019s not going to court, I am,\u201d he said, adding that he was due in court at 9am. In the Facebook Live session, Packham also emphasised that his condemnation of spring hunting didn\u2019t amount to persecution of the Maltese. \u201cWe\u2019ve come out here not as people from the UK wagging their finger at the Maltese, not even as Europeans \u2013 seeing as we\u2019re still part of the EU \u2013 but just as people who are concerned about the birds,\u201d he said. Killing birds during the spring breeding season is forbidden under the European Union birds directive but Malta has an opt-out to enable its 10,000 hunters to continue their traditional shoot of migrating birds. Birds such as the turtle dove \u2013 last year added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s \u201cred list\u201d of species most at risk of extinction \u2013 are illegally hunted. However, this year 15 corpses of protected wild species, including marsh harrier and hoopoe, have also been handed to BirdLife Malta. The environmental organisation has filmed a hunter illegally shooting a rare stone curlew. Another charity, the Committee Against Bird Slaughter (Cabs), caught two people illegally shooting turtle doves after the end of the spring hunt. Packham said he had also found golden plover held in tiny cages in the hot sun, and these crimes were \u201cobviously the tip of the iceberg\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just bizarre what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we experienced yesterday BirdLife Malta and Cabs experience all the time. It makes it so difficult to get the law upheld when the local police are very uncooperative because they will be friends of or family of or drinking in the same bar as the people we are trying to incriminate.\u201d Malta narrowly voted to continue the tradition of spring hunting in a 2015 referendum, and Packham said the government was not doing enough to stop illegal hunting around the still-legal spring shoot. \u201cThe amount of interest and commitment that the government has put into policing these crimes has diminished because there\u2019s an election on the horizon [in Malta] and the government doesn\u2019t want to upset 10,000 hunters and their families,\u201d said Packham. He called on the EU to take action against Malta. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on contravenes the European birds directive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want Malta to comply with the birds directive like every other country does.\u201d The Maltese police said they could not comment on an individual case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
