The Lib Dems\u2019 policy has been drawn up by former MP Jo Swinson, who is hoping to win back her seat in East Dunbartonshire in June. While a coalition minster, Swinsondrew up the proposals that led to the introduction of rights to shared parental leave. \u201cParents across the UK have already benefitted from greater flexibility and freedom in how they share the care for their new baby,\u201d she said. \u201cBut more needs to be done in order to encourage men to take leave when they become a dad, to bond with their child during the early weeks and months of their life. \u201cResearch shows that fathers being more involved in their children\u2019s lives is good for children\u2019s development and good for the health and happiness of the whole family.\u201d Swinson said the Lib Dems wanted to give \u201cdads across the country the chance to spend more time with their children\u201d. Susan Kramer, the party\u2019s business spokesman, said paid paternity leave of least a month would result in a workforce that was more flexible and more motivated, and that this would benefit British businesses. \u201cIt is the Liberal Democrats who are standing up for fairness and flexibility for parents,\u201d the peer said. \u201cTheresa May has never cared.\u201d Though Labour have not announced its policy, their pledge in their draft manifesto would match the Lib Dems. Labour says it would double paid paternity leave to four weeks and increase paternity pay \u201cbecause fathers are parents too and deserve to spend more time with their new babies\u201d. Labour has long been in favour of the increase in paid paternity leave. Ed Miliband\u2019s 2015 manifesto included a pledge to increase the amount of paid from \u00a3140 to more than \u00a3260 a week. The policy of shared parental leave was introduced two years ago and gives parents the right to divide up to 52 weeks between them, as well as up to 39 weeks of statutory shared parental pay. However, the government has estimated that only 2% to 8% of 285,000 eligible working fathers take advantage of shared parental leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
