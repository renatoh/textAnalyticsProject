Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched episode six. OK everybody, hold it right there. I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I\u2019ve perfected my Morse code deciphering skills. Line of Duty finales are when the show tends to throw everything at the wall. This time was no different, as we were treated to the sublime (a lengthy interrogation) and the ridiculous (Steve\u2019s out-of-the-blue realisation that Dot was tapping out Morse code as he died). That said, it was a more downbeat conclusion than in previous series, which I appreciated. I\u2019ve always loved Line of Duty for its quieter moments rather than its ever-so-twisty twists and enjoyed the fact that final revelations largely made sense instead of milking shock moments for all they were worth. The bad guys We all called it \u2013 Gill Biggeloe was a \u201crotten apple\u201d (and not just because she spelled her surname the wrong way). Kudos to those who pointed out that Biggeloe having been a defence lawyer would prove a key plot point. I thoroughly enjoyed the revelations concerning the extent of her villainy (yes, even the moment when everything went a bit slasher film in the toilets), largely because Polly Walker has been a poisonous delight in the role. Unsurprisingly, Biggeloe provided many of the night\u2019s best moments, from wiping the smug grin off DCS Carmichael\u2019s face by pointing out that the eager DI Brandyce had filed the wrong paperwork, to unwisely suggesting that Carmichael should stay in the interrogation room with Steve and Kate because \u201cit\u2019s up to you if you want to be in on it or not\u201d. Indeed every small exchange between Biggeloe and Anna Maxwell Martin\u2019s Patricia Carmichael, AKA the Maximilien Robespierre of the anti-corruption world, was worth savouring. Ted\u2019s interrogation might have been billed as the main event, but the real action was happening on the undercard as Carmichael and Biggeloe circled each other in a particularly venomous game of cat and mouse. With all that going on, it was no surprise that the OCG plot strand took a backseat. There was one brief scene featuring Lisa McQueen\u2019s interrogation (after all that, it seems she was just a criminal, albeit one who wanted to change) and another focusing on Ryan\u2019s acceptance to police academy (yes, yes, you were all right). In truth that was OK with me. Jed Mercurio, the writer, has always been tighter on the police corruption element than on the gang plot. If I have a complaint about this particular series, it\u2019s that in the early episodes it got bogged down in gang interaction when the interesting stuff has always been AC-12\u2019s increasingly desperate attempts to stem the flood of corruption in the force. The good guys It might have been obvious but I\u2019ll admit I let out a small cheer when Kate and Steve decided to save the gaffer themselves. And then an even bigger one when they marched straight past Carmichael and into the interview room in what was pretty much a declaration of war. Kate, in particular, was on fire this evening, from telling Brandyce where to go, to ensuring that all the regulations were observed to the letter even as she worked at cross purposes from Carmichael. I\u2019ve said it before but she\u2019s much better at being a DI than at being undercover. The episode\u2019s main thrust, however, was Carmichael\u2019s tense interview of an increasingly broken Ted. This was pretty much a showcase for Adrian Dunbar and he rose to the challenge, showing us a Ted who was both recognisable and surprising: a man obsessed with his moral righteousness, who felt so ashamed of watching pornography that he dumped his computer; who had, if not an affair, then close feelings for the young and widowed Anne-Marie McGillis; and who felt guilty about his past and bewildered by his present. The story, when it was finally divulged, had its roots as expected in Ted\u2019s time in Northern Ireland: a sad tale of a Catholic cop in a largely Protestant force who found some sort of kinship with a Catholic widow grieving over the violent death of her husband. It was a kinship that was to prove disastrous for both of them \u2013 and for the next generation as well. Which brings us to the real victim: John Corbett, a decorated undercover officer who was primed as a weapon by Biggeloe, lied to, betrayed and set on a path of destruction that would ultimately result in his death. The callous way Biggeloe used Corbett without heed as to what would become of him was bleakly believable. Like so many officers on this show, he died in the line of duty, but as Ted sorrowfully observed, it was a \u201ctragic, senseless death\u201d. Case notes Is it just me or did the explanation for Dot\u2019s dying message make no sense? I feel as though I\u2019m through the looking glass here \u2013 once there was H, then there were balaclava men, now there are four caddies. What\u2019s next? An explanation that he was also wiggling his toes to tell us more? I was quite glad when Steve suddenly turned into Mr Exposition and got us up to speed on all the salient plot points. Less so, however, by Ted\u2019s unravelling of Biggeloe\u2019s motivation and actions, if only because I kept imagining her saying: \u201cAnd I would have got away with it if it wasn\u2019t for you pesky kids in AC-12.\u201d Where did Ted hide the rest of the money and how complicit was he in Anne-Marie\u2019s death? Despite the holes in his storyline, I still trust him and was pleased he gave the \u00a350,000 to Corbett\u2019s widow, but even I must admit he\u2019s not as straightforward as he pretends to be. Well done Gill, for calling out the world\u2019s most useless police solicitor. Poor DI Brandyce: when Carmichael wants someone gone, they\u2019re toast. That said, the reference to glasshouses by DCC Wise was well-made given that Carmichael\u2019s team consisted of one bent copper and one incompetent one. That\u2019s nearly as bad as the shaggers of AC-12. In another first season reference, Ryan cited Simon Bannerjee \u2013 the police constable he gave the run-around to \u2013 as the officer who made him want to become a cop. For something to pass the time with now that Line of Duty is over, check out crime writer Adrian McKinty\u2019s outstanding Sean Duffy series, which is all about a Catholic cop in Northern Ireland during the 80s. Weasel of the week Smug, self-satisfied and seemingly convinced that she was too smart to be caught, Gill Biggeloe was the weasel\u2019s weasel, a woman who offered hope with one hand, only to quickly snatch it away. Quote of the week \u201cWe\u2019re witnesses not suspects, now stop making a tit of yourself and piss off.\u201d DI Kate Fleming lays down the law. So what did you think? Was it a satisfying conclusion or one with too many plot holes? Were you glad Steve and Kate saved the day, and did you believe Ted\u2019s tale? Finally, it\u2019s been a pleasure reading all your theories over the past six weeks, thanks for reading, commenting and pointing out the errors. See you back here next time provided there\u2019s no urgent exit required \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
