As a paid-up member of the Special One's fan club, Newcastle United's manager feels frustrated that some of his Stamford Bridge counterpart's biggest qualities are often obscured by the sheer force of the Portuguese's personality. \"What Jos\u00e9 does, which goes undetected because of his personality where he can be thunderous and articulate in the same sentence, is his work on the training ground, his organisation and what he demands from his players,\" said Pardew. \"Those things sometimes get forgotten. \"One of the big stands he makes is commitment, absolute commitment. If players don't offer that to him, then they don't play. When you've got that at a big club then you're going to get more results than not. Defensively he's one of the best coaches there is and you can very rarely score three goals against them. I take my hat off to what he does with his team.\" If Pardew sounded a bit like someone in the grip of a slight \"man-crush\", he turned distinctly envious when the subject of Mourinho's rapprochement with Roman Abramovich was raised. \"He seems to have repaired his relationship with the owner and that's made them a formidable force,\" said a manager whose own union with Mike Ashley, Newcastle's owner, and Joe Kinnear, the club's director of football, is somewhat complicated. \"They've got spending power and great players. Jos\u00e9's one of those charismatic people that fans and players buy into. When you buy into someone like him it can be infectious. When he came back to Chelsea you could see there was a real genuine good feeling about the place and it helps when a manager has got that. It makes the job easier.\" Pardew's own task is made more difficult by not only last week's 2-1 defeat at Sunderland but the statistic which reveals Newcastle have won only once at home in the Premier League all season. It means he will be delighted if Mourinho feels sufficiently upset by his side's performance to indulge in some technical area histrionics. Not that he objects to the Chelsea manager's \"it's all about me\" posturing. \"If you're a football person and you can't love what Jos\u00e9's about or what he does, then you can't love the game,\" said Pardew. \"He makes me laugh. \"But Jos\u00e9 doesn't want to be jumping round me because I'll give him a slap. I'm bigger than him and he knows that. He can jump around in the crowd or whatever he does.\" Whatever the result the pair will catch up over a glass of Pardew's favourite Rioja after the game. \"We have a relationship where we have contact,\" said Newcastle's manager. \"It's important sometimes because you can share information about other teams.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
