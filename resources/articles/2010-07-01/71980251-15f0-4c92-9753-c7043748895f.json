It is grade II-listed, stands in Woodford Green and takes the form of a descending torpedo bomb. Its only begetter was Sylvia Pankhurst, and it was designed by Eric Benfield. One of its four inscriptions simply says: \"This monument is raised as a protest against war in the air.\" Another is a dedication to the statesmen who attended the 1932 disarmament conference in Geneva, which failed to ban bombing planes. Pankhurst's intention was to draw attention to the high price paid by civilian victims, increasingly regarded merely as collateral damage. Unveiled again in 1936, it drew attention to the mustard gas bombing of defenceless civilians in Abyssinia by Mussolini's fascists. Among the countless examples that have followed were the \"shock and awe\" tactics used against Baghdad. As Pankhurst wrote: \"All the love in all the mothers' hearts cannot prevail against the stern economics of Capital.\" Even Margaret Thatcher had a problem with the thought of pressing the nuclear button because she had grandchildren. Sylvia Ayling London \u2022 The Bomber Command memorial proposed for Green Park is a very serious misuse of the park, of the powers of democracy, and of the media. The myth that there is no memorial to Bomber Command in central London has duped many into being supporters. Those who died are individually remembered in the books of remembrance in the RAF's memorial church, St Clement Dane's, where there are also statues to Harris and Dowding, and there is a memorial in Lincoln cathedral, near several airfields. Those behind the proposals convinced Westminster council's planning committee, which gave consent but referred the decision to the communities secretary as a precaution. The latter has refused to call the application in. The failure to protect Green Park, which has existed as \"countryside in the city\" for centuries, amounts to a major injustice. Westminster set aside its policies, which said no more memorials in the Hyde Park area; the royal parks waived their policy of a moratorium on any more memorials; and the mayor, Boris Johnson, would not comment, although the park is metropolitan open land. There are alternative sites, but there is no alternative to the precious space, which, once lost, cannot be replaced. Tom Ball Thorney Island Society, London \u2022 Many of our 100,000 or so existing war memorials are neglected. Perhaps we should protect and conserve those before allowing new ones to be erected. It would surely be a fitting tribute to focus on conserving them in time to mark the centenary of the first world war. Frances Moreton Director, War Memorials Trust \u2022 On Armed Forces day, the Peace Pledge Union led a walk round peace-related memorials in central London \u2013 of which, unlike the ever-growing number of war memorials, there are not many. Absence of peace no doubt accounts for it. The walk took in the Burghers of Calais, the statues of Edith Cavell, Fenner Brockway and Gandhi, and many others. More information about these can be found at http://www.ppu.org.uk/memorials. Jan Melichar Peace Pledge Union, London \u2022 It is remarkable how few central London streets are named after anyone except aristocratic landowners. Holbein has a place in Chelsea, Sir Hans Sloane several streets and a square, and that's about it. Newton Street off Holborn is too old to have been named after Isaac. Purcell and Darwin have buildings named after them but no streets in town. Shakespeare has a modest statue in Leicester Square. Wren built his own memorial: St Paul's Cathedral, where a Latin inscription inside says: \"If you require a monument, look around you.\" London's biggest celebration of poets, artists, authors, composers, explorers and one scientist was the use from the 1920s until the 1960s (when letters were replaced with numbers) of their names as telephone exchanges.
