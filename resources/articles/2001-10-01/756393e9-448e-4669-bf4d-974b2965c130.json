The producers said they were losing about \u00a330,000 a week and \"the number of cancellations and general crisis in the tourist industry forced us to cut things short.\" The show will close on October 13. Shows on Broadway however have been hit harder. Five shows have closed prematurely after the attacks, and performers and stagehands took a 25% pay cut to keep other shows afloat. \u0095 Meanwhile, safety fears have prompted Janet Jackson to cancel her European tour. \"If anything happened to anyone on this tour, I could never forgive myself,\" she said. A statement issued today said that the singer had \"decided the risk to her large group of tour personnel is too great to proceed comfortably.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
