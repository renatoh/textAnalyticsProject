In a ground bereft of fans and noise Real delivered a performance to keep very quiet about. Real claimed afterwards, of course, that it was mission accomplished, crisis averted and other such clich\u00e9s but against what was effectively Roma's B team, they were reliant on dubious Italian goalkeeping and a weak refereeing decision to give them their first two goals last night. Ronaldo scored after only nine minutes, the Brazilian benefiting from Ivan Pelizzoli's desire to keep his gloves clean, while the experienced Dutch referee Rene Temmink bought Ronaldo's blatant dive on the hour to award a penalty from which Luis Figo scored. Those were the decisive moments on a most peculiar night, Figo's second eight minutes from time meriting the status of afterthought. But Real had garnered the win they needed, since Bayer Leverkusen's 3-0 win over Dynamo Kiev meant a draw would not have been enough for Madrid, and they are into the last 16 . From a silent night in Rome not many, even in the Spanish capital, will be shouting that this team can rediscover former glories and capture a 10th European Cup next May in Istanbul. The false nature of the occasion means discerning the true state of Real is complicated. \"Teams need the presence of fans to inspire them,\" said the Real manager Mariano Garcia Ramon by way of explanation for the workmanlike display. What can be said is that, without those aberrations from Pelizzoli and Temmink, this would have been a different match. Roma, without Francesco Totti, Antonio Cassano and Vincenzo Montella, added to the artificial feel of the contest and Kiev, who finished third in the group, will rightly be aggrieved this morning. The Ukrainians, and the Champions League, deserved better from the Italians. Having walked out into a stadium that can hold 80,000 but which had about 150 officials from either club, reporters, photographers and a few stewards, the players of both sides must have felt weird. Uefa still played the Champions League anthem before kick-off but there was no roar after the match finished. Instead there was a nervous hush. When Ronaldo then put a header over in the second minute there was a ripple of polite applause, reminiscent of a village cricket reception. His next involvement brought a greater response, not least from a Spanish radio commentator who went through the whole \"gol, gol, gol, gol, goooolll\" routine and who was given his own ovation. Running on to a touch by Zinedine Zidane from a pass by David Beckham - Real had started all their gal\u00e1cticos - Ronaldo surged unmarked into the Roma area. The angle was narrow and Pelizzoli was off his line. But once Ronaldo shot, Pelizzoli half-turned, possibly to avoid being injured in a collision. The ball flew into the far corner. It was a most curious incident, though conspiracy theorists' stimulation was undermined by the purpose which the stand-in Roma midfield proceeded to show, even with nothing to play for. Vincent Candela struck the bar with a 31st-minute free-kick and Iker Casillas made an alert block from Leandro Cufre seconds before the interval. But on the hour Ronaldo ran at Roma again and, under a featherweight challenge from Traianos Dellas, flung himself to the turf. Temmink pointed immediately to the spot and Figo stepped up. With that Real had avoided a first-ever failure to qualify from the Champions League group stage, Figo's late goal merely adding deception to the result. Beckham's claim that others will find the prospect of meeting Real in the last 16 \"frightening\" was the appropriate way to end a strange night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
