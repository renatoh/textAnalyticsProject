Mr Jackson is in London this week following a holiday in South Africa. He is said to be considering an offer from the ITV director of television, Simon Shaps, to take up the newly created position. He would take over the responsibilities of the ITV controller of entertainment, Claudia Rosencrantz, who announced she was leaving the broadcaster just before Christmas. It is understood that the ITV comedy editor, Sioned Wiliam, would report to Mr Jackson if he accepts the job. BBC executives are thought to have considered approaching Mr Jackson about taking over as the head of entertainment production. The role fell vacant last month when it was revealed that Wayne Garvie was moving to BBC Worldwide to be the director of content and production. However, industry insiders believe Mr Jackson is likely to accept Mr Shaps' offer. Mr Jackson became the chief executive of ITV's US production arm, Granada America, two years ago after working for the company in LA for six months on attachment. He has overseen the sale of a number of ITV formats, including Hit Me Baby One More Time and Hell's Kitchen, to US broadcasters. Granada America has also sold a number original formats to the US market under Mr Jackson, including Nanny 911, a children's behaviour makeover show, to Fox. Mr Jackson is one of the UK's most experienced entertainment programming executives with a TV career spanning nearly 35 years. He has been at ITV for just over five years, having joined Granada as the head of its Australian production operation in late 2000. Mr Jackson came back to London in early 2002 to run Granada's entertainment department and was appointed the director of international formats and entertainment towards the end of the same year. He has a long and distinguished track record as a producer, director and programming executive. In the 80s he produced award-winning comedies The Young Ones, Red Dwarf and Three of a Kind. He joined Carlton Television as director of programmes when the company first won its ITV franchise in 1992. He became its managing director when Carlton TV took over the London weekday licence from Thames on January 1 1993. Mr Jackson later became the managing director of Carlton Productions before leaving the company in 1996. After a stint as a freelance director, Mr Jackson became the head of BBC entertainment in 1997. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
