The Germany coach, Horst Hrubesch, admitted he was relieved the scoreline had not been worse and with good reason \u2013 Portugal were irresistible. This was expected to be the clash of the tournament\u2019s two best teams but it ended up being probably the most one-sided contest of the whole competition. Player of the tournament John Guidetti. Picked up the Uefa bronze boot for his two goals but more than that he was the chief talisman and rabble-rouser for the champions. Sweden\u2019s quality should not be underestimated \u2013 Oscar Lewicki and Ludwig Augustinsson were particularly good \u2013 but it was their tenacity and determination that was the driving factor behind their success. And no one embodied that more than their striker. For pure talent, though, it is a tie between William Carvalho and Bernardo Silva. Team of the tournament Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 (Portugal); Carl Jenkinson (England), Jannik Vestergaard (Denmark), Paulo Oliveira (Portugal), Ludwig Augustinsson (Sweden); Emre Can (Germany), William Carvalho (Portugal), Oscar Lewicki (Sweden); Bernardo Silva (Portugal); John Guidetti (Sweden), Domenico Berardi (Italy). Best tweet Stefano Sturaro, Italy, without a shadow of a doubt. \u201cDogs celebrate on the corpses of lions, thinking they\u2019ve won, but lions remain lions and dogs stay dogs.\u201d Sturaro was not particularly impressed with Sweden\u2019s draw against Portugal in the final group game, a result that meant both those teams went through to the semi-finals despite Italy\u2019s win over England. Best quote \u201cWhen you lose 4-1 it\u2019s a bit embarrassing. We\u2019re the best in the Nordics! We\u2019re going to play in the final! We\u2019re Sweden! The rest can just go home!\u201d \u2013 John Guidetti gives Denmark both barrels after Sweden\u2019s victory in the semi-final. Best translation June 22, Italy\u2019s pre-England-match press conference at the Andruv Stadium. An Italian journalist asks an extremely long question. Italy manager Luigi Di Biagio gives an equally long answer. Italian translator says question is \u2018typically Italian question\u2019 and moves on Best coach Hakan Ericson. Got so much out of his Sweden team. Their performances \u2013 particularly in the final \u2013 were characterised by positional discipline and tactical nous and while that did not always make them particularly pleasing on the eye it did maximise the talent at Ericson\u2019s disposal. The setup in the final nullified so much of Portugal\u2019s threat and tempted Rui Jorge into tactical changes that in the end suited Portugal\u2019s opponents. Best callback After the presentation of trophy the Swedish team ran towards fans behind goal saluting \u2026 a reference to their ill-tempered play-off win over France. Best referee Polish official Szymon Marciniak shone in the final. He let the game flow brilliantly and kept his cards in his pocket until late in the game rather than seek to make an unnecessary early statement. Biggest disappointment England arrived with great expectations and ended up bottom of their group. Oddly, they were the only team to beat Sweden (although that fact only serves to add to the sense of what might have been). Loudest fans Sweden.
