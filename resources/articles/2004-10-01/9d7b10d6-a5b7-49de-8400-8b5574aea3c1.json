'Not everyone is complimentary,' he reflects, looking back on a career of criticism and the absurd pitch it reached last month in Austria. 'You can't let it bother you though, otherwise you would spend every day worrying.' It is only just over four weeks, though it seems much longer, since James let that tame shot from Andreas Ivanschitz creep under his body to ensure England's World Cup qualifying campaign got off to the rockiest of starts, a 2-2 draw in Austria. The Manchester City goalkeeper had been replaced by the time Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's players secured a face-saving win in Poland four days later, and until such time as Paul Robinson drops a similar clanger or misses a game through injury, James is back in his familiar role as England's number two. There is no doubt many people prefer him there, since, for all his self-deprecating charm, dedicated professionalism and outstanding form for Manchester City, James has proved unable to rid himself of the error-prone tag. He is a capable goalkeeper with a propensity for occasional mistakes, and in an England context mistakes are always likely to be expensive. The team might have got away with dropping two points in Vienna, but James himself received such a media coating it made one wonder what would have happened had he made the same blunder in a semi-final or the last few minutes of extra time. He has enough sense not to torture himself with scenarios of that sort, and quite rightly refuses to dwell on Mavis the Donkey or any of the other insults that came flying his way after Vienna. 'I don't actually read the papers,' he says. 'I don't know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, but after Austria I certainly didn't need anyone else to tell me what I had done wrong. What others said about it, from what I can gather, was bizarre. I've had criticism before and arguably I threw the gauntlet down by suggesting the papers came up with something new. I won't be doing that again.' It says a lot about James that he is still willing to talk to newspapers, let alone joke about what must have been a painful episode, but he is now mature and thoughtful enough to handle disappointment. Goodness knows he has had enough practice. 'I was only told I was being dropped on the day of the Poland game, but I was expecting it, there had been clues,' he says. 'The way Sven did it made sense. Telling me straightaway would have given me three days to walk round with my head up my arse. Not that I would do that, but there's always the chance. 'I've always been aware the next game dictates who will be number one. The game against Austria wasn't the best, hence the exit from the side, but I'm happy with my form since then. Robbo didn't do anything wrong against Poland, he's been playing well for Spurs, so he's in on form and that's the way it should be.' It might be easy for James to say that, but having understudied David Seaman for so long, surrendering his England place after a single tournament must be harder to take. James is philosophical about that as well. 'I don't like not playing, not for a minute, because I'm a professional and I want to be out there doing it against the best,' he says. 'If I am back to number two I accept it for the right reasons, and because England's number two ain't a bad place to be.' Knowing James's luck, he will now be accused of lacking ambition or preferring the comfort zone, when nothing could be further from the truth. 'It's not that I want to stay number two, but this perception in football that if you're not number one you're nothing is foolish. I am happy with the way I'm playing. I'm not 39 years old and struggling to maintain form, I'm not playing badly and thinking I'm lucky to be in the squad. If I never play it will only be because whoever is in front of me is playing damn well, and from a team point of view that will be good.' Being out of the country at the time, James received much of his media vilification second hand, only discovering each latest indignity when fans or fellow professionals offered their sympathies. Far from being enraged by tabloid excesses, James was actually quite touched by the kindness of ordinary people, and so managed to take some sort of positive from the experience. 'People got in touch from all around the country, saying they were disgusted with the treatment I was getting,' he says. 'I've had encouragement from everyone around me at City, and some positive responses from people I would never have expected. I'm not going to tell you who they are, but they helped, as did the letters from people I didn't know from Adam. You think you know all about football, you think you have experienced everything, then you find there's still something new.' The England players also appeared to offer support by their silent protest in Poland, although James can confirm that was not solely for his benefit. 'There had been a lot of criticism aimed at a lot of players, and the decision was for the team,' he explains. 'Since Sven has been here the team ethos has become really strong - we really do feel for each other. We are not individuals, we are a team.'
