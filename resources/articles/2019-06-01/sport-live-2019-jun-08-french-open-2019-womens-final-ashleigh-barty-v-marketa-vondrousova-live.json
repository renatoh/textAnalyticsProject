I\u2019m so proud of myself and my team. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy two weeks!\u201d Barty drops to her haunches after realising what she has just achieved. That was emphatic from the Australian, who never let Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 get a foothold. Second set: Barty 6-1, 6-3 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): A big net cord takes the Czech to 30-15 and a loose cross-court backhand from Barty hints at some nerves. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 though seems unable to capitalise and from 40-30 up she is only spared a match point on her own serve by another fortunate net cord. However, Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 fails to put away a volley to win the game and on the next point a measured rally ends with the Czech dumping a forehand into the net. Barty seals the win with an overhead smash! Second set: *Barty 6-1, 5-3 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): After some fight in the last game we get more passivity from Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 on the Barty serve. Short rallies and power hitting Barty take her within a game of the title. Second set: Barty 6-1, 4-3 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 seems flat and so is the crowd. Everyone can tell where this is going... or can they? A fiery winner to go up 15-0 and some resistance from the baseline sees the Czech hang around for another game. Second set: *Barty 6-1, 4-2 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Too good from Barty, she beats Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 at her own game with a delicate backhand drop shot to go up 15-0. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 hangs in to get back to 30-30 but then on on consecutive points Barty pushes her opponent deep then hits winners into the open space to hold. Second set: Barty 6-1, 3-2 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): A rare straightforward service for Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1. She finishes off the game to love by drawing Barty into the net and putting away a backhand into a near-empty return court. Second set: *Barty 6-1, 3-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): No such luck on the Barty serve, a dominant hold. Second set: Barty 6-1, 2-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Barty is not giving up anything, forcing Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 to work for every point. The Australian gets some additional fortune when a close line call goes her way to bring about another break point but this time Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 shows some resistance, saving two break points to hold. Second set: *Barty 6-1, 2-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Even Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 gets a sniff she cannot capitalise. After forcing Barty on to the back foot the Czech misses an overhead to move to 30-30. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 shows some good fight to reach deuce, pulling Barty into the net to and then sending her scrambling back again. Barty looks steely-eyed though and holds firm to consolidate her break. Second set: Barty 6-1, 1-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Barty is not letting up here and this could be over quickly. The Australian again breaks with relative ease. Earlier on we saw Dominic Thiem set-up a rematch of the 2018 final with Rafael Nadal in the men\u2019s singles. Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from Roland Garros: Looking ahead to the grass court season, Andy Murray, who is set to return in doubles action at Queen\u2019s later this month, has revealed that he is \u201cpretty relaxed\u201d about ever playing singles again: First set: *Barty 6-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Barty marches towards a set lead showing some real power on her groundstrokes and reaching 40-15 with a wonderful overhead. The Australian is made to wait but eventually seals the game and first set with a whipping forehand. First set: Barty 5-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1\u2019s momentum is immediately halted as Barty earns three break chances with a drop shot of her own. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 saves one with a firm forehand drive down the line, another by going cross-court and when Barty floats a slice into the net we are back at deuce. That rally is short-lived, two errors from Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 later and Barty will serve for the first set. First set: *Barty 4-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 creates an opening at 30-40 but Barty reads her opponent\u2019s latest drop shot attempt to pull back level. A hint of complacency from Barty gives the Czech two more shots at an immediate break-back and the second is taken. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 finally gets herself on the scoreboard. First set: Barty 4-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Thanks to Will for letting me get a little breather after that epic men\u2019s semi-final. I will be guiding you through the remainder of this one. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 is having a hard time getting on the board but is refusing to move away from her game, including a trademark drop shot. Barty though is relentless and so far has chased down everything. The Australian outlasts her rival in this one, eventually taking a third break point to put the first set firmly within her grasp. First set: Barty* 3-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Barty looks the more settled here, that\u2019s for sure. She goes 30-0 up with a vicious forehand from the baseline, which Vondrousova has no chance of catching. The game is wrapped up with a cracking forehand into space. No messing about from the Australian. First set: Barty 2-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Vondrousova completely miscues a backhand and it floats off court and then she whacks another into the net from the baseline leaving her plenty to do. Barty does similar with a forehand and then a double fault gifts the Australian two break points. The first is squandered by sending one very long but Vondrousova sets her own downfall in the end with an overhit forehand. First set: Barty* 1-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Barty serves first and looks in good nick as she races into a 30-0 but a long forehand gives Vondrousova in opening. The teenager does not build on it, as she cuts a backhand straight into the net. An ace from Barty completes the hold. The pair are now getting into the swing of things on court after posing for photos and sending the mascots on their merry way. Here come the players, along with the mascots and a massive bunch of pink flowers each. I am not sure what they are supposed to do with the flowers during the game. The sun is certainly out but there\u2019s a little bit of cloud around, even if most of them look pretty friendly. Will I learn to spell Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 off the top of my head? No. It\u2019s a copy and paste job, I suspect. Thiem wins! So not too long to go now ... Barty found a gap in the weather to begin her warmup. Thiem loses ... put that second bottle of wine in the fridge. Thiem has broken back against Djokovic and is now serving for the match. All these disruptions have not really helped either player. It looks very sunny at Roland Garros now, which is a relief. Rather annoyingly for this game Djokovic has broken Thiem in the final set. Could be a bit of a wait, still. Thiem and Djokovic are readying themselves to return to the court, which is good news. The rain also means Barty and Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 have been unable to get much time on the outside courts to warm up, so it still could be quite a while until the women\u2019s final begins. At least the rain is a great reminder of what a broadcaster Matt Smith is. He\u2019s deserved better gigs than the ones he has had during his career. A lovely fella, too. The covers are coming off ... There is currently no play in the men\u2019s semi-final and the umbrellas are still up at Roland Garros. Might be a good time to make a coffee or open a bottle of wine. Matt Smith and Annabelle Croft are currently explaining the impact of weather. Croft is backing Barty to win the final, it would seem, saying playing a left-hander will not worry the Australian. There\u2019s still plenty of wind and rain about in Paris, delaying Djokovic v Thiem and might have an impact on this game later, too, but let\u2019s hope not. Barty quit tennis in 2014, playing professional cricket for a period before returning to the court two years later. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible journey the last three years,\u201d Barty said after her semi-final victory. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible journey the last two weeks. I feel like I have played some really good tennis, some consistent tennis. Although that level wasn\u2019t there today for the whole match necessarily, it was there when I needed it. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of myself the way we were able to go out there and handle it today. All things considered, we\u2019re in a pretty amazing place now.\u201d And now it\u2019s raining at Roland Garros \u2026 Prior to this, Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1\u2019s finest performance at a Grand Slam saw her reach the fourth round of the US Open last year, so she is certainly in uncharted territory. A bit more on Ashleigh Barty heading into today\u2019s final ... It\u2019s not the French Open final anyone anticipated at the start of the tournament but here we are and it should be a pretty exciting one. Ashleigh Barty arrives as the favourite against Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, who has saw off Johanna Konta in the semi-final, meaning she will certainly be ready for the occasion. As they are both surprise finalists there should be a little less pressure on them and could make for an entertaining clash at Roland Garros. Barty has come back to tennis after quitting the sport in 2014 and is certainly calmer on court. Teenager Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 has pulled off the odd shock on the way to the final but, needless to say, this will be her toughest test. She is yet to drop a set all tournament, which shows what kind of form she is in. Either way, it will be a great day for one of these. However, it will be slightly delayed due to Djokovic v Thiem overrunning. Luckily, you can follow it all here:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
