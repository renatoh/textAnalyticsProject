If not, it would be kicked forward into the next Senate, with its much reduced Democratic majority, where the 67 votes necessary for ratification look like a dauntingly steep climb. In theory, this should not be a hard sell, with all the Pentagon's top brass lining up to tell Congress that failure to ratify would undermine national security by further delaying the return of US inspectors to Russian nuclear sites. They have not been on the ground since last December when the old Start treaty expired. But there are also financial considerations behind the Senate's foot-dragging on ratification. America's nuclear laboratories have teamed up with Senate Republicans led by minority whip, Jon Kyl, to squeeze extra funding out of an administration that is short of cash but desperate to bank some solid achievements. The Washington Post is reporting that the White House has added another $4.1 billion to sweeten the pot, added to the $10 billion pledged to the nuclear weapons complex over the next ten years. It is not clear yet whether the money is intended for the Tennessee uranium facility and the plutonium laboratory in New Mexico that Senator Kyl was holding out for. There is an argument, made forcefully in The Bomb: A New History by former weapons designer Stephen Younger, that a smaller arsenal requires a greater degree of certainty that the warheads work, especially in the case of aging weapons and a moratorium on testing. To reach that level of certainty and to make sure you are able to re-engineer the weapons if they develop fundamental problems, you need to keep the necessary brain power and institutional memory in the labs. But how much money is enough to meet those goals? Daryl Kimball at the Arms Control Association deems the labs already well-funded and describes Kyl's bid to wring yet more cash out of the beleaguered administration as \"irresponsible and unnecessary.\" Maybe so, but it seems to have worked. Meanwhile, a parallel ideological attack on New Start has been taken up by the extraordinary pairing of Bush's former UN envoy, John Bolton, and legal scholar, John Yoo, who argue in the New York Times that the mid-term election results represent a thumbs-down for the treaty. Yoo is most famous for the memos he wrote in the Bush justice department, which paved the way for the use of torture in Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib etc. So what is the common thread connecting torture and opposition to the New Start treaty? It seems to be a conviction, shared by Yoo and Bolton, that the US should make its own rules on the world arena and damn the consequences. As Bolton himself once said: There is not that much difference between me and the people who want a world where no government has nuclear weapons. I only want one government to have nuclear weapons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
