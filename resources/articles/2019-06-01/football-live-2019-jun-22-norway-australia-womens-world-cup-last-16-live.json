There is plenty of analysis and insight to come from my Guardian colleagues, but I\u2019ll leave you for now. Thanks for joining me, wherever you are in the world. That was some football match. Much analysis from tonight will concern the refereeing and VAR. Should Australia have been awarded that early penalty? Should Kennedy have been send off? Why was the constant physicality against Kerr allowed to go unchecked? The Matildas are beginning to filter through the mixed zone. They look shattered, not unsurprisingly. From the miracle in Montpellier to the nightmare in Nice, it\u2019s been a rollercoaster World Cup for the Australians. Now it is all over. They get a warm send-off from the Australian fans at the Stade de Nice, who are still in full voice. For Norway, their resilience in seeing off Australia will give them confidence ahead of a likely quarter-final clash with England in Le Havre. But the physical battle they\u2019ve just endured, not to mention the 120 minutes plus penalties, might leave them as the walking wounded. A Norwegian reader offers a riposte to Sam Kerr: \u201cSuge p\u00e5 det! (suck on that!)\u201d Whatever you think of the legitimacy of the question, it is certain that the \u2018what if\u2019 query will be asked long and hard - what if Football Federation had not sacked coach Alen Stajcic just months before the World Cup? Well. There will be plenty of analysis and insight in the minutes, hours and days that follow. But as a starting point, that Sam Kerr opening penalty miss will long be remembered. She skied the ball high and got the Matildas\u2019 spot-kicks off to the worst possible start, after Caroline Graham Hansen had calmly opened the Norwegian account. Norway are through to the round of 16. A penalty horror show from the Matildas has ended their World Cup aspirations. Norway 4-1 Australia: Engen hits it clear and true. Australia have been knocked out of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup. This next penalty could win the match for Norway. Norway 3-1 Australia: Catley scores Australia\u2019s first. The Matildas are still in it - just. Norway 3-0 Australia: Captain Mjelde takes a big run up and hammers it home. Do or die now for Australia. Norway 2-0 Australia: Gielnik the second taker for Australia. She places it, steps back, then re-places it. Hjelmseth saves. All over for Australia? Norway 2-0 Australia: Reiten steps up, and buries it. Advantage Norway. Norway 1-0 Australia: Up walks Sam Kerr. Australia\u2019s hero from the Jamaica game. She skies it. That was a very poor attempt from Kerr - did the pressure get to her? Norway 1-0 Australia: Graham Hansen, perhaps the player of the match, faces Williams, another contender for that gong. She places it perfectly. Norway to shoot first. Up steps Graham Hansen. Referee Hussein is doing the coin toss to decide who shoots first. The Aussies are ready, lined up on the halfway line, while the Norwegians remain huddled. In response to my colleague Richard\u2019s observation about England (or Cameroon) being the true victor tonight, a reader writers in: \u201cYou might remind Mr. Parkin that England\u2019s supporters probably thought the same when the men\u2019s team came up against Croatia last summer.\u201d Tonight\u2019s regular correspondent offers his tip: \u201cIf it goes to penalties, I call 4-3 Australia. Williams has been Schwarzer like and is well prepared. I fear a Viduka from Kerr but hope not.\u201d 120+2 min: And it\u2019s time for penalties!!! Despite going down to 10 women after Kennedy\u2019s red card, the Matildas fought on and kept out the dangerous Norwegians. Now for the lottery of spot-kicks. How good is football?! 120 min: Last gasp stuff from the Aussies in the face of yet another Norway attack, but it works - and the Matildas win the goal-kick. Carpenter is replaced by Harrison for Australia. 119 min: Australia intercept and break forward, but then turn-over the ball. Norway break back and find Graham Hunter, who hits it straight to Williams. Two minutes added time before we go to penalties. 118 min: Norway with a corner, but it doesn\u2019t trouble anyone and is bundled out for a goal-kick. 117 min: My colleague Richard Parkin with the press box banter: \u201cyou know who\u2019s won this match? England. Their qarter-final opponent is going to be knackered.\u201d 116 min: Composed defending from the Matildas as Norway pepper the Australian pepper the area. 115 min: Roestbakken - who is of Norwegian descent - is brought on for Australia, replacing van Egmond. 114 min: van Egmond is on the ground for Australia and not looking in any hurry to get up. She is attended to by medical staff. 113 min: Norway break forward with an overlap. Reiten - who has been unusually quiet tonight - collects and shoots, but Williams gets a hand to it. That woke up the Norwegian fans, who begin a loud chant. 112 min: Australia hold the ball to give themselves an opportunity to breathe, but an errant pass forward sees Norway regather. Hansen almost collects a dangerous cross on the far right, but she slips it into touch. 110 min: Minde puts in a dangerous cross from the left (side note - how many times have I used the word dangerous tonight? Indicative of how fluid Norway have been in the final third, or perhaps that I need a thesaurus...). Nothing comes of it, but Graham Hunter unleashes on the rebound - just wide of Williams for a goal-kick. 109 min: Graham Hunter - who has been a weapon all match - marauds forward. Australia clear, only to face another barrage. How much more of this can they withstand? 106 min: Plenty of differing views on Twitter about the Kennedy red card and then Hussein\u2019s decision not to give Utland a second yellow, but I think we can all relate to this. 105 min: We\u2019re straight back into it, with the Norwegians immediately rushing forward. Maanum has a hit but it goes well-wide. 105+4 min: Hussein brings some reprieve for the embattled Matildas. That red card to Kennedy - which to my eye looked a little harsh - has swung the match in Norway\u2019s favour. But Australia only need to hold on for 15 minutes plus change to determine this match via penalties. 105+3 min: Williams is off her line and B\u00f8e Risa has a speculative shot which hits the crossbar and bounces behind. The Australians are living dangerously. 105+2 min: Cards are flying here. B\u00f8e Risa the latest to collect a yellow, for a tug on her Matildas\u2019 counterpart. Tensions are beginning to flare. 105+1 min: The free-kick is drilled straight at Williams by Mjelde, and it doesn\u2019t trouble the Australian goalkeeper. Three minutes of added time for the first-half of extra-time. 105 min: VAR doesn\u2019t overturn the red, and Kennedy marches off despondent. Dangerous free-kick for Norway about 25 metres from the Australia goal. 103 min: Kennedy pulls on Utland\u2019s shirt as the two tussle on the run and it is a straight red! Wow! But again, VAR is checking. 102 min: Our Russian friend writes in again: \u2018Maybe I have been cruel to Sam Kerr. She has been very womanhandled by the Norwegian defence and has been unlucky not to receive some more friendship from the referees and VAR.\u2019 100 min: Some errant defending sees Graham Hansen again running at the Australians on the edge of the area. She\u2019s the danger woman for Norway right now, as she has been all night. Norway then make another change: Moe Wold off for Hansen. 99 min: Corner Norway, but it comes to nothing. The Norwegians regather around the centre-circle and spray the ball out wide, but the Matildas then counter via Sam Kerr. 97 min: Both teams still have subs up their sleeves, and I suspect changes are imminent - each side is looking leggy. Norway charge at Australia through the middle, but an intercept sends the Matildas on the counter-attack. The Norwegians then regather and Graham Hansen fires straight at Williams, who again pulls off a remarkable save. END TO END STUFF. 96 min: Williams is getting some medical attention after appearing to hurt her leg on a corner. That will cause nerves for the Australians if this heads towards penalties. 94 min: Graham Hansen tries to run at Carpenter but the 19-year-old sends the ball out for a throw. B\u00f8e Risa ends up on the ball from the resulting move and THUNDERS the ball at Williams, who tips over with a remarkable save. 93 min: Norway corner. Some remonstrating in the box by the referee. Australia make a sub: Polkinghorne on for KK. The corner is cleared. 91 min: Sam Kerr is through on goal after a beautiful lofted pass, but can\u2019t find her way around Hjelmseth. Some suspicion of a penalty from that last gasp Norwegian defending by Thorisdottir, but no VAR review. Kerr then has another opportunity a minute later, but again nothing. 90 min: We\u2019re underway, again. Norway immediately unpick the Australian defense, but some last gasp defending prevents the move from threatening. I am not opposed... Australia have thus far only made one sub, while the Norwegians have twice made changes. Don\u2019t forget that teams get an extra sub in extra-time, so three possible changes for the Aussies and two for Norway. 90+4 min: FREE FOOTBALL! Another 30 minutes of this - how good! 90+4 min: Australia with an attacking throw, but it amounts to nothing. Extra-time imminent. 90+3 min: Us too, Jen, except there are sadly no dogs in the press box. 90+2 min: Graham Hansen goes so close! The Norwegian star hits the woodwork. SO CLOSE. The ball only just avoids bouncing into the goal. Heart in mouth stuff her in Nice. 90 min: Norway launch forward. Minde collects the ball on the edge of the Matildas\u2019 area, but the ball is bundled out for a corner. 89 min: No pen and Kellond-Knight steps up for another corner. She then single-handedly stops a Norwegian counter-attack. Is there anything this woman can\u2019t do?! Four minutes of added time are announced. 88 min: Another Australian corner. And VAR is checking for a possible penalty after Yallop is brought down in the box. 86 min: Gielnik breaks down the right after Australia shut down a dangerous Norwegian foray. Her cross is deflected out for a corner. Just before that goal Mary Fowler appeared set to make her debut (maybe Ante is reading this blog...) but that substitution has now been recalled. 83 min: THEY\u2019RE NOT OVER NOW! Kellond-Knight scores from the corner - it misses everyone and loops in. It appeared Gielnik had touched it, but her movement actually threw off the Norwegians and the ball swung into the goal. KK!! 81 min: Australia with a lion\u2019s share of possession at the momentum and the occasional foray into the Norway area, but are struggling to create any real chances. Are the Matildas\u2019 World Cup hopes about to be over before they really began? 80 min: Peter writes in with this witty take: \u201cRe Australian supporters chanting in French - unless Australia score soon, I reckon that Sam Kerr will also be speaking some French after the final whistle.\" 79 min: The clock is ticking and the Matildas are in desperate need of a goal. Might creative dynamo Mary Fowler, just 16, be brought on for her tournament debut as a final roll of the dice by Milicic? 76 min: Goalscorer Herlovsen is replaced, by Utland. The Matildas prepare another attacking sortie, switching from side to side before launching down the right via a throw-in. 75 min: Attendance tonight announced at just 12,229 - one third of total capacity. That is a great shame for the people of Nice, many of whom have missed out on an epic game of football - and there\u2019s still 15 minutes to go! 74 min: Norway\u2019s Graham Hansen runs, runs and runs some more at the Australians, before firing a dangerous pass into the penalty area. Carpenter is first to the ball, though, for the Matildas. 73 min: Norway beginning to tire in the face of relentless Australian pressure. But they did enjoy an extra-days rest, so might have the legs to outrun the Matildas as the game heads towards its finale. Milicic makes his first sub: Raso off for Gielnik. 71 min: While we take a short break for a substitute - Saevik off for Maanum - Terje can enlighten us on the Norwegian team nickname: \u201cIt actually hails from 1995, after the famous World Cup win in Sweden. At this point in history, the men\u2019s national team were riding high, and had earned the widespread nickname \u201cDrillos\u201d, after the legendary coach Egil \u201cDrillo\u201d Olsen. A national newspaper decided that the women\u2019s team should have a nickname too, and invited the readers to come up with suggestions, for which the public should vote. The winner was \u201cGresshoppene\u201d (probably inspired by the centipede-like celebration), but as you would expect of a constructed nickname, it never caught on, and I cannot really remember it being used at all during those halcyon days, let alone in the 25 years to follow.\u201d 69 min: Herlovsen receives the ball in space on the left and breaks forward dangerously, but Carpenter - one of the players of the tournament for Australia - sprints back and dispossesses. 67 min: Australia break into space, but ultimately hold the ball up and try to pass their way through the Norwegians. Right, left, right - and Sam Kerr\u2019s head just misses the well-placed cross that eventually comes in. 65 min: I\u2019m not the only one with heart palpitations from this enthralling encounter, as the Norwegians launch yet another counter-attack. 64 min: Australia counter from a Norwegian half-chance. Raso miscontrols a switch ball onto the right, but wins a corner after regaining composure. 63 min: Our Russian refereeing friend is in touch again: \u201cThe longer that this game goes on this way, the more I am reminded of the Australian men\u2019s Footballing Kangaroos game against Japan in Germany in 2006, despite the lack of two clear hand balls in that game. As a neutral I hope that it doesn\u2019t take until the 86th minute for there to be an evening of the scores. I would like to see penalties decide this game due to the Australians being denied two penalties on my book.\u201d 61 min: Yallop collects the ball on the right and fires a shot towards Hjelmseth, but it goes wide. End to end stuff at the moment - entertaining football. 60 min: Last-ditch defending from Catley prevents a certain Norwegian goal, as her out-stretched leg pokes the ball away from an on-rushing forward. 59 min: Goalllllllllll..... or not. Sam Kerr collects a nice pass and fires past Hjelmseth, but the celebrations are quickly ended when the goal is ruled out for offside. 58 min: Kerr\u2019s head connects to the corner but the ball spirals straight into the arms of Hjelmseth. 57 min: Australia regain control and move the ball around the centre of the Stade de Nice. They try going left, then switch central, before Kennedy launches a long ball forward. Foord finds herself in space and fires a shot, but it is deflected for a corner. 56 min: Kate on Twitter reflecting the collective mood of Australian fans, as Norway have a double opportunity in attack. 54 min: Kellond-Knight\u2019s free-kick slams into the wall and eventually the Norwegians clear. Norway are looking compact and organised defensively, just as expected. Can Australia break them down in the remaining 35-odd minutes? 52 min: Australia win a free-kick on the edge of the area after Raso is brought down by Minde - who receives a yellow card for her efforts. Great run, that, by Raso. 51 min: Carpenter is keen to make up for her error and she sends a long throw forward for Logarzo, but Foord can\u2019t quite send the resulting cross goal-bound. 49 min: A poor pass from Ellie Carpenter is intercepted and Norway maraud forward, before the Australians counter and find themselves in the Norwegian box. But Raso mishits. 48 min: I covered the Norwegians for their opening match against Nigeria, and said the below in my match report. If my prohecy comes true, I apologise to our Australian readers. The last time Norway beat Nigeria in a Women\u2019s World Cup match, they went on to win the tournament. The Norwegians\u2019 rout of the African champions on Saturday evening may not have quite matched that 1995 result \u2013 8-0, the fourth-worst defeat in World Cup history \u2013 but after more than a decade in the doldrums, Norway sent a powerful statement in Reims: even without their star striker Ada Hegerberg, the Grasshoppers are back. ... Reims was once the site where France crowned its kings. Norway have a long way to go before they may be crowned queens of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup. But if they reach the final in Lyon, they will look back on their visit to regal Reims as an auspicious, history-repeating triumph over Nigeria. 47 min: Not a statistic our Australian readers will appreciate. 46 min: Peepp! We\u2019re back underway. Norway begin proceedings. H\u00e5kon with a bold claim: \u201cHow can you say that\u2019s a penalty? You can clearly see the upper arm tucking in behind the shoulder/chest just before the ball hits the player. Some serious anti-Norwegian bias going on in The Guardian tower.\u201d On the other hand, a Russian (and therefore presumably neutral) reader, chimes in with this: \u201cAs a ref, albeit an over 35s ref, there is no way I would have reversed my initial call if I were Hussein. Thorisdottir has clearly dropped the shoulder, making her body \u2018unnaturally bigger' thus gaining an advantage when the ball made contact with the arm. She knew what she was doing, or in danger of doing because she tried to pull her arm back as soon as she realised it was going to hit it. It was an clear case of misconduct.\u201d Fifa\u2019s resident DJ at the Stade de Nice is clearly an Australian fan - Waltzing Matilda is blasting at half-time. Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong Under the shade of a coolibah tree, He sang as he watched and waited \u2018til his billy boiled You\u2019ll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me My inbox is full of VAR takes. Keld: \u201cA good VAR call again. Yes, there was doubt whether it hit her shoulder, breast or top of the arm. But even if hit the arm, it really didn\u2019t look like punishable handball. The arm\u2019s position did not make her \u2018body unnaturally bigger\u2019 as is the relevant criteria in the new rule.\u201d Hugo writes in with a long missive, but I think the crucial point is this: \u2018Get rid of VAR.\u2019 I need to briefly dash to make use of the facilities before returning for the second half. In the interim, here\u2019s my colleague Louise Taylor\u2019s musings from her past week on the move around France. Bryn on the VAR controversy. \u201cI don\u2019t like that it would be a penalty, but under the rules of the game currently can\u2019t see how it isn\u2019t? VAR slowly destroying the game of football. How does it take nearly 5 mins to make that decision?\u201d Some VAR thoughts from readers. Scott: \u201cWhy not just let a fifth official make the call without having the ref jog around? It\u2019s silly to make everyone wait for that, ain\u2019t it?\u201d Mark: \u201cHuh, I\u2019m convinced that was not a penalty, yet each replay suggests the ball hit her arm. But it didn\u2019t, did it.\u201d Any thoughts? Email or tweet @KieranPender 45+4 min: Hussein blows her whistle to end the first half. A fairly even initial 45, Norway are ahead after a sustained period of attacking pressure led to a goal. The Matildas will be aggrieved not to have won a penalty for a hand-ball in the box; it was initially given but then overturned by VAR. 1-0 Norway, but still everything to play for. 45+3 min: The Matildas build pressure, keeping the ball deep in Norway\u2019s half with three consecutive throw-ins. But it amounts to nothing as a wasted shot goes out for a goal-kick. 45+2 min: Australia are creating space and movement out wide, but are being let down by the final ball into the middle. It\u2019s no Sam Kerr header-fest against Jamaica... 45 min: After all that VAR-ing around, there are four minutes of added time. Australia win a free-kick in a dangerous area, but the quick-take proves ill-advised and bobbles out for a goal-kick. 43 min: VAR-cical. After a long wait, Hussein reverses her initial decision. Looked like a fairly clear handball to me, but the question is one of height - it was well above the elbow. 43 min: After a long wait and some crowd booing, the clock is stopped as referee Hussein goes off to consult the replays and confer with her VAR colleagues. 41 min: A cross is bounced down by Thorisdottir\u2019s arm/shoulder and referee Hussein calls a penalty. VAR is checking... 39 min: Norway with consecutive dangerous corners. Australia are under the pump here. Can they hit back before half-time? 37 min: And then Norway break back! Graham Hansen with a searching run before firing at Williams, but the short is deflected out for a corner. 36 min: Saevik is having some game on the wing for Norway. She tries to go through Logarzo near the Australian area, but the Washington Spirit player is having nothing off it. The resulting corner is cleared and Australia break. 35 min: Either the Australian travelling support have learned French, or the Matildas are the local favourites here - chants of \u201cAustralie, Australie\u201d are ringing out across Stade de Nice. 33 min: The Matildas are suddenly playing with more vigour, but their forays into the Norwegian half are unsuccessful - a lofted ball for Kerr in the box doesn\u2019t connect. 31 min: After Sam Kerr almost scored for the Matildas, Norway respond by going straight up the other end. Saevik finds Herlovsen with a perfectly-weighted ball in transition, and the number nine outsprints her opposite number before firing home past Williams. Goallllll! Advantage Norway. 29 min: Raso causing havoc in the Norwegian box, falling to the ground and then rebounding to stay on the ball. But her effort ultimately amounts to nothing. The Portland Thorns\u2019 forward has been Australia\u2019s best attacking player thus far tonight. 27 min: Engen begins a delightful move through the midfield and looks to get the ball back near the Matildas\u2019 area, but it goes out for a throw. The Norwegians are looking very dangerous when running at the Australians - they have some serious pace. 26 min: The stadium here in Nice is not even half-full. Disappointing effort from the locals and Fifa deserve serious criticism - their on-ground marketing efforts have been very lacklustre. 24 min: Graham Hansen with another shot in space, this one goes wide. Australia were the better side for the first 10 or 15 minutes, but Norway now with the run of play. 22 min: Excellent defending from the Australians, who block two consecutive dangerous balls into the box. Reader Adam has some tactical musings: \u201cWondering if Norway\u2019s fullbacks ought to drop just a liiiiittle bit deeper to provide outlets either side? Mjelde and Thorisdottir are looking a bit isolated against a narrow Australian front three.\u201d 21 min: This time it\u2019s Graham Hansen on the right-hand side for Norway - and her cross-cum-shot finds its way straight to Williams. The Matildas need to improve their defensive efforts out wide. 20 min: It may only be 5.20am in eastern Australia, but that isn\u2019t going to stop Australia\u2019s political class from waking up for the game - and tweeting about it. 19 min: Norway are beginning to create opportunities in attack. Some nice movement sees Saevik on the run with space down the right flank. Her cross is dangerous but ultimately clear. 18 min: Australia get out of jail after a mis-pass from Foord in the penalty area is collected by Herlovsen. The resulting shot runs across an open goalmouth and out for a goal-kick. 16 min: A lull in proceedings. Saevik tries to get things going by speeding past Kellond-Knight, who pulls her down. Free-kick Norway. Don\u2019t forget that you can write in with your thoughts on the match (or whatever else you fancy discussing): email or tweet @KieranPender. 15 min: First corner of the match goes to Australia. van Egmond fires it in, and Hjelmseth collects awkwardly - the ball bounces skyward, but the keeper is able to regather. 14 min: Minde powers a header straight at the Matildas\u2019 custodian Williams, but the Norwegian ace is called back for offside. 13 min: More from Fifa\u2019s statistical boffins: \u201822 June is the same date on which Norway contested the Round of 16 four years ago in Canada, when they were defeated 2-1 by England.\u2019 Australian fans will be hoping this omen bodes well for the Matildas. 11 min: Kerr into the action once more, getting a touch onto a cross, her the ball goes well wide. After her four goal heroics against Jamaica, are we going to see more celebrations from the Aussie captain? 10 min: Moe Wold takes the ball down the right flank for Norway, before passing it into the centre. It pops out again for the wider player, whose cross looks dangerous but is cleared. 9 min: How\u2019s this for a double stat attack, via Fifa: \u201cNorway have not won back-to-back Women\u2019s World Cup fixtures since 2007, when they beat Ghana followed by China PR. Australia enter this match on the back of two consecutive victories, but have never won three Women\u2019s World Cup games in succession.\u201d History about to be made/broken... 7 min: Australia are looking the better team in the early stages, finding some nice fluid movement in attack and are as yet untested defensively. Just as I write that Norway have the ball uncontested in a dangerous area above the Australian penalty area, but the opportunity ultimately amounts to nothing. 5 min: Raso again causing danger, cutting in from the right and finding space in the Norwegian box. But a shot goes straight into the arms of Hjelmseth. 4 min: Raso with a delightful run right through the Norwegian midfield but her final pass is intercepted. Norway look to launch a counter, but the ball goes out for a goal-kick. 2 min: Norway look to create a chance on the left flank but Carpenter is composed in defence and regathers. This is the seventh meeting between Norway and Australia. Norway have the overall advantage, just, with three wins to two, plus one draw. But the Matildas are unbeaten in the past three. 1 min: Sam Kerr into the action immediately, picking up a Foord pass after just 26 seconds and finding herself alone in the Norwegian box. Her shot goes just wide. 1 min: Peepppp! We\u2019re underway at the Stade de Nice. The crowd is underwhelming but I suspect there will be nothing underwhelming about the 90+ minutes of football we are about to enjoy. Anthems have been belted and we\u2019re about to get underway. Regular reader Keith, an Australian in Italy, writes in: \u201cThe channel controllers are nothing but consistent - can\u2019t obtain live TV of this match either! It seems Aussies in Italy are banned from viewing!\u201d As is my tradition, I have crowd-sourced some tips from the great and good of the press box (read: those seated immediately adjacent to me). Positive vibes for the Matildas... Richard Parkin (the Guardian): 0-0 (Australia on penalties) Ben McKay (AAP): 1-2 Australia Ella Reilly (the Guardian): 1-2 Australia Kieran Pender (the Guardian): 2-3 Australia (after extra-time) Ezra writes in: \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the Matildas. They can show the Socceroos a thing or two about success in major competitions.\u201d Agreed, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves... A (presumably) Norwegian reader, Torbj\u00f8rn, writes in: \u201cNot too sure about the origin of \u2018Gresshoppene\u2019, but it has a double meaning in Norwegian. It can mean grasshoppers, but can also mean female horses on grass (a \u2018hoppe\u2019 is a female horse in Norwegian).\u201d I approve of this excellent pun action from the Aussie fans. And here\u2019s the Norwegian starting XI: 4-4-2: Hjelmseth; Moe Wold; Thorisdottir; Mjelde (C); B\u00f8e Risa; Herlovsen; Graham Hansen; Engen; Reiten; Minde; Saevik Ante Milicic has swung the changes for tonight\u2019s match, making four changes. Elise Kellond-Knight returns, replacing youngster Karly Roestbakken at left-back. In the midfield, Tameka Yallop has overcome a corked calf to start ahead of Katrina Gorry. As the manager foreshadowed at the pre-match press conference yesterday, Milicic is making two amendments to the forward line: Caitlin Foord and Hayley Raso in for Lisa De Vanna and Emily Gielnik. These changes revert the team towards the side that faced Brazil - 10 or the 11 starters for the miracle in Montpellier begin tonight. The line-ups are in. First-up, here\u2019s Australia: 4-3-3: Williams; Carpenter; Kennedy; Catley; Kellond-Knight; van Egmond; Yallop; Logarzo; Raso; Kerr (c); Foord I want to commend the excellent musical stylings of Fifa\u2019s resident DJ, who has been blasting AC/DC all afternoon from the stadium\u2019s PA system. My only complaint is that, during the men\u2019s World Cup in Russia, each team had a \u2018national\u2019 song played before kick-off. The Socceroos enjoyed \u2018Down Under\u2019 by Men at Work. But for whatever reason, Fifa have abandoned this excellent tradition in France. While we are on this slightly esoteric tangent, let me commend Fifa\u2019s pre-match hype song to you - Halfway There by Ti\u00ebsto &amp; Dzeko. I\u2019ve been trying to find out why the Norwegians are nicknamed the Gresshoppene (Grasshoppers). My intel to date suggests that it stems back to their gold medal win at the 2000 Sydney, when (I\u2019m told) the players crawled on the turf following the win. Apparently the nickname is no longer commonly used in Norway, but it is included in Fifa\u2019s official materials. Norwegian readers with insight are most welcome to write in, via email or Twitter: @KieranPender. And here\u2019s more Parkin. I particularly enjoyed this opening line: \u201cLike any metric Fifa rankings are a crude measure best taken with a sack of salt. \u201c My favourite colleague Richard Parkin is with me in Nice, and he\u2019s been writing up a storm ahead of the game. Check out this on the threat Norway pose to the Matildas. If you\u2019ve been living under a rock and not yet read our comprehensive team previews, or want to refresh your knowledge ahead of the match, see below. Norway in Nice at nine (local time). Alliteration aside, the Matildas\u2019 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup clash with the Norwegians is perhaps the most significant match in Australian football in a decade or more. Australia have only won one World Cup knock-out match (male or female) in history, when the Matildas beat Brazil in 2015. With a highly-rated squad and the best striker in the world in captain Sam Kerr, expectations are high \u2013 as they have been since before the tournament. For the first-time ever, the Australians are favourites in a World Cup knock-out clash. A win in Nice will be a huge boost for Australian football. A loss will lead to inquests, recriminations and questions about what might have been. But the favourite tag is debatable. Former world champions Norway have performed admirably in a tough Group A, losing only to hosts France. They have several world class players and play a compact, organised style. Guru Reiten and Caroline Graham Hansen will test Australia\u2019s shaky defence, while defensive stalwart Maren Mjelde will be seeking to keep Kerr at bay. We\u2019re in for a big 90 minutes (and possibly more). I will keep you updated live from Stade de Nice - where the sun is shining and Fifa\u2019s hype music is cranking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
