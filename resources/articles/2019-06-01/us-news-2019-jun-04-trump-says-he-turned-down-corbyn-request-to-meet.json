On the second day of his state visit, during which he has been hosted by the Queen and Theresa May, the US president set out his ambitions for a \u201cphenomenal\u201d post-Brexit trade deal with the UK. But following a cross-party backlash, the president later appeared to row back on his comments. In an interview with Good Morning Britain\u2019s Piers Morgan, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade.\u201d Appearing earlier in the day alongside the outgoing prime minister at a joint press conference, Trump said US companies should have market access to every sector of the British economy as part of any deal, which he said could lead to a tripling of trade with the UK. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So NHS or anything else. A lot more than that,\u201d he said, although May appeared to have to explain to Trump what the NHS was before he answered the question. Trump\u2019s statement drew immediate condemnation from several Tory leadership hopefuls as well as senior Labour politicians. There are widespread concerns in the UK about US firms promising to provide cost-cutting health services and wanting to sell food produced to lower environmental and animal welfare standards, such as chlorine-washed chicken. Corbyn told a packed protest on Whitehall, not far from the press conference, he would not allow Brexit to open up \u201cour precious wonderful National Health Service to private American companies to come in and take it over\u201d. \u201cWe will not stand for that. We will fight with every last breath of our body to defend the principle of a healthcare system free at the point of need for everybody as a human right,\u201d he said. Corbyn turned down an invitation to the Queen\u2019s state banquet for Trump but it emerged during the press conference that he had requested a private meeting with the president. Trump said he had rejected the request from Corbyn, describing him as \u201csomewhat of a negative force\u201d. \u201cHe wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t like critics as much as I like and respect someone who can get things done.\u201d He dismissed the protest attended by Corbyn as \u201cvery small\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d, while implausibly claiming thousands had lined the streets to welcome him on Monday. Organisers of anti-Trump protests said up to 75,000 people had demonstrated against the state visit in central London. May appeared uncomfortable at the suggestion the NHS could be included in a trade deal, saying both sides would \u201cnegotiate and come to an agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future\u201d. However, she did not explicitly rule it out. That was left to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who is running to be Conservative leader. \u201cDear Mr President. The NHS isn\u2019t on the table in trade talks \u2013 and never will be. Not on my watch,\u201d he tweeted. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, also ruled it out this week, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t conceive of any future prime minister, for any party, ever agreeing that we would allow NHS procurement to be part of trade talks, because the NHS as a publicly run, publicly owned institution is part of our DNA.\u201d Even Dominic Raab, a rightwinger in the Tory contest who has suggested offering tax breaks to companies wanting to provide NHS services, said: \u201cI want to see the UK get fair deals on trade with the US and many other countries when we leave the EU. But the NHS is not for sale to any country and never would be if I was prime minister.\u201d As well as backtracking on his NHS views, Trump also softened his stance towards Corbyn, holding out the prospect of a meeting in the future. Asked if he could imagine negotiating a trade deal with a government led by the Labour leader, Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible. Anything is possible.\u201d With May leaving office by the end of July, Trump was careful to praise her efforts to deliver Brexit but also made it known he was planning to talk to the leading candidates to replace her. The US president was due to have one-to-ones with Hunt and Michael Gove, the environment secretary, but Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, turned down the chance of a meeting in order to address One Nation Tory MPs at a hustings event on Tuesday night. Asked for his views on the candidates, Trump said: \u201cI know Boris. I like him. I\u2019ve liked him for a long time. I think he\u2019d do a very good job. I know Jeremy. I think he\u2019d do a very good job. I don\u2019t know Michael. Would he do a good job, Jeremy? Tell me.\u201d In fact, Gove had interviewed Trump for the Times in January 2017, with the pair pictured together with their thumbs aloft. Two hardline Brexit supporters, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, and Owen Paterson, a former cabinet minister, both met Trump as well and Nigel Farage was later pictured driving into the US ambassador\u2019s residence for a meeting. Afterwards, the Brexit party leader tweeted: \u201cGood meeting with President Trump \u2013 he really believes in Brexit and is loving his trip to London.\u201d Trump and the first lady Melania also hosted Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, at Winfield House in Regent\u2019s PArk in London, the official residence of the US ambassador. Tory leadership candidates\u2019 views on any trade deal are likely to be high on the agenda when they meet Trump. But their position on Huawei, the Chinese tech firm, is also crucial as the US is opposed to its involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G communications network and has hinted it could harm US-UK intelligence sharing. However, Trump said there should be \u201cno problem\u201d with intelligence sharing between the US and UK based on his conversations with May, raising the prospect of a possible climbdown on the issue. \u201cWe are going to have an agreement on Huawei and everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. We did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We\u2019ve never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner and we\u2019ll have no problem with that.\u201d A No 10 spokesman said only that there was a review of the Huawei plans under way and declined to say whether the NHS could be part of any trade deal. After Trump\u2019s press conference, politicians called on the Conservative leadership candidates to rule out allowing it as the price of a trade deal. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said US corporations \u201ctaking over our NHS is a nightmare scenario\u201d. \u201cThe Tories appear happy to give Trump what he wants, and some want to offer up our NHS to get the no-deal Brexit they are campaigning for,\u201d he said. \u201cIf our NHS is taken over by US corporations, it will undermine it as a free, universal public service. The NHS is only safe in Labour hands.\u201d Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: \u201cMillions of people will be shocked and angry at the suggestion of selling off access to our NHS in return for the opportunity for Donald Trump to fill our shelves with chlorinated chicken,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats will continue to fight for the people to get the final say on Brexit so that we can protect the NHS.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
