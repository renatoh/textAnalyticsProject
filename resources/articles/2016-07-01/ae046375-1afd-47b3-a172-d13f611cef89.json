Hailing from the Curve, Leicester, it has clearly been conceived as a vehicle for Pixie Lott but, although she works tirelessly hard on her theatrical debut, Richard Greenberg\u2019s version is no more successful than its predecessor, or indeed the Blake Edwards movie, in capturing the deliquescent grace of Capote\u2019s story. Pixie Lott is almost as deliciously named as the heroine of Capote\u2019s tale, Holly Golightly, a capricious fantasist who captures the imagination of the story\u2019s narrator, Fred, her neighbour in a New York brownstone in wartime. Lott is never still, does more costume changes than Danny La Rue and certainly conveys Holly\u2019s instinctive sexual ardour: \u201cI\u2019ve never been to bed with a writer,\u201d she cries, spreadeagling herself over Fred\u2019s prostrate body. But, while I admire Lott\u2019s energy, she never captures Holly\u2019s childlike innocence or suggests the hillbilly origins under the character\u2019s sophisticated veneer. It is no surprise that Lott only appears fully relaxed when she sings the numbers that Grant Olding has carefully woven into the text: Moon River, inevitably, but also People Will Say We\u2019re In Love from Oklahoma! and a plangent lyrical ballad. Lott, who thrums a mean guitar, is a musician to her fingertips. As an actor, she still needs to learn the art of repose. But, if there is something strenuously pointless about the enterprise, the fault lies not with Lott. Greenberg faithfully reproduces Capote\u2019s dialogue and retains his narrative voice. He can\u2019t however, disguise the fact that Holly is essentially a literary creation who defies plausible embodiment, even by Audrey Hepburn in the movie; nor can he convey the cryptic elegance of Capote\u2019s writing, which announces the arrival of Holly\u2019s friend Mag with: \u201cShe entered like a windrush, a squall of scarves and jangling gold.\u201d On stage, you also become aware of the limitations of Capote\u2019s story: where Christopher Isherwood in his Berlin stories established a tension between Sally Bowles and the Nazis\u2019 rise to power, Capote makes little of the contrast between Holly\u2019s comparable hedonism and the action\u2019s second world war setting. The one positive about Greenberg\u2019s version is that it highlights the dilemma within the narrator himself: he is emotionally enthralled by Holly but physically attracted to men. At times that is somewhat overstated, as when Holly urges him to pick up a passing sailor on Brooklyn Bridge, but Matt Barber brings out the confusion in Fred\u2019s divided soul extremely well. There is also good support from Victor McGuire as a stalwart bartender who nurses a deep affection for the prickly Holly. The blunt truth, however, is that there is nothing essentially dramatic about Capote\u2019s novella: there is one midpoint narrative surprise that makes us see Holly in a new light, and that\u2019s about it. What we are left with on stage is a series of vignettes, a mechanically efficient production by Nikolai Foster and the presence of Pixie Lott. That may be enough for some. But I would rather see her in a role that gives full rein to her marvellous singing voice than as Capote\u2019s mercurial gadfly. At Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, until 17 September.
