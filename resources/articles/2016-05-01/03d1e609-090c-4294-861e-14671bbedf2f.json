The Spain goalkeeper, 25, saw his proposed move to Real Madrid collapse last summer after the paperwork was not signed off in time. De Gea had been due to sign a contract worth \u00a39.2m a year which ran until 2021, with Real\u2019s Keylor Navas going to Old Trafford in return. However, despite another excellent campaign that saw him named United\u2019s player of the year for a record third successive season, it is understood the goalkeeper is waiting to see whether United make a managerial change in the summer before committing his future. If Van Gaal does stay on to complete the final year of the contract he signed when he succeeded David Moyes in May 2014, it is believed that De Gea will press behind the scenes for a transfer. United have been reported to have a pre-contract agreement with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who, like De Gea, is represented by the agent Jorge Mendes, and it is believed that their prospects of retaining the goalkeeper may rest on appointing the Portuguese. De Gea is said to be unhappy at the prospect of another season without Champions League football, although he signed a new four-year contract with United in September. Reports in France on Monday night also suggested that the Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been offered a year-long contract by United with the option of another year \u2013 a claim that was dismissed as \u201cnot factual\u201d by his agent, Mino Raiola."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
