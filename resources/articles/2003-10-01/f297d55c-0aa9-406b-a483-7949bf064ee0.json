Their goal came from a penalty won and converted by Andy Liddell, who equalled David Lowe's club record of 66 league goals, and it teed up tomorrow's visit by third-placed Sheffield United, for which they will be hoping for a bigger crowd than the 6,696 who suffered Saturday's performance. \"A woeful display,\" said the manager Paul Jewell. \"Probably the worst of the season.\" The penalty was awarded 10 minutes into the second half, when the Gillingham defender Paul Smith was adjudged to have pushed Liddell as the striker weaved his way into the area. There seemed to be only the slightest contact but the referee had no hesitation in making the award. Wigan were just about worth the victory but Gills could point to two glaring misses from Rod Wallace, who both times put his shot high and wide with only John Filan to beat. The worst of them came when Mamady Sidibe picked him out with a cross, but the former Leeds and Rangers striker spooned his shot. \"Teams that don't play well but win games tend to be the successful ones,\" Jewell added. \"Gillingham are a hard team to play against as they tend to close you down and chase and harass. We are grateful for the victory.\" Wigan are not renowned for their potency at home, having scored only seven in their previous six games, and again they struggled to break down the visitors, Tony Dinning spurning a couple of chances and Jimmy Bullard seeing a long-range effort saved. Then came the referee's intervention. \"I'll have a look at the penalty again on video but it did seem a bit harsh,\" said Gillingham's manager Andy Hessenthaler. \"This is the second game in succession were we have played well but have come away with nothing. The chances missed by Wallace proved to be crucial, but that's the way things are going for us. \"Wigan are top of the league and we are in the bottom four now. We need a bit of luck and a couple of goals to go in , then we should be OK.\" Man of the match: Stephen McMillan (Wigan)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
