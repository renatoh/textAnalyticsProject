N\u00f3brega, an ex-special forces police captain, also had close links to the family of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. N\u00f3brega was killed by police on Sunday in Bahia state where he had been on the run. \u201cWho gained from the death of ex-special forces captain Adriano N\u00f3brega,\u201d tweeted Franco\u2019s widow, Monica Benicio. Franco\u2019s leftist PSOL party said N\u00f3brega was a \u201ckey piece\u201d in discovering who ordered Franco\u2019s killing and called for a full investigation. \u201cWitness elimination? Another attempt at obstruction of justice? Who ordered our companion killed? We demand answers,\u201d tweeted S\u00e2mia Bonfim, a PSOL congresswoman. Police insisted that was not the case, claiming N\u00f3brega had opened fire on officers when they attempted to apprehend him in Esplanada \u2013 a small town 1,700km north of Rio. Maur\u00edcio Teles Barbosa, the security chief in Bahia state, said: \u201cWe attempted to carry out the arrest but the target preferred to respond by shooting.\u201d N\u00f3brega was hiding in a country property owned by a local councillor for the PSL party for which Bolsonaro was elected, but has since left. Gilsinho de Ded\u00e9 told the G1 news site he had no idea N\u00f3brega was hiding there, had never met him, and suspected the fugitive had broken in. Franco was killed in March 2018 and paramilitary gangs \u2013 mafias made up of serving and former police officers who control vast swathes of Rio state \u2013 are widely believed to have been involved in her murder. Two former police officers are imprisoned, accused of killing her but deny the accusations. The suspected shooter, Ronny Lessa, lived in the same Rio condominium as Bolsonaro and his son Carlos \u2013 both have denied the accusations. Lessa had allegedly been a member of N\u00f3brega\u2019s gang, called the Crime Bureau. As well as contract killings, it ran construction rackets in west Rio. \u201cThe question we have to ask is: in whose interest does it serve that Adriano has been killed?\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Alves, a professor of social science at the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro who has studied the state\u2019s paramilitary gangs. \u201cHe could have taken the investigation of the death of Marielle to a new level.\u201d Marcelo Friexo, a leftist congressman who was very close to Franco, said: \u201cAdriano was a very violent person and it is possible he did not want to give himself up alive, just as it is also possible he was executed\u2026 He had a lot of involvement with the Bolsonaro family.\u201d N\u00f3brega, his wife and his mother are named in a criminal investigation into allegations of embezzlement, money laundering and racketeering involving Bolsonaro\u2019s son Fl\u00e1vio, ex-police officer Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz and others. N\u00f3brega and Queiroz had previously served in the same police battalion. Prosecutors believe that Queiroz collected some of the salaries of staff employed in Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet when he was a representative at Rio\u2019s state legislature and paid the money back to him which he laundered through a chocolate shop and properties. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro and Queiroz have denied the allegations. \u201cI always did everything correctly within the law,\u201d Fl\u00e1vio said in December, arguing he is being persecuted. In written testimony last year, Queiroz said he chose cabinet aides and \u201cmanaged\u201d their salaries to \u201cintensify political performance\u201d without telling his superiors, the O Globo newspaper reported. N\u00f3brega\u2019s wife, Danielle Costa, and mother, Raimunda Magalh\u00e3es, were both employed in Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s office. Prosecutors described them as \u201c\u2018ghost employees\u2019\u2026 who transferred resources back to the operator Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz.\u201d N\u00f3brega \u201cwas also benefited by some of the resources,\u201d prosecutors said in court documents seen by the Guardian. In December a Rio court authorised searches of properties \u2013 including the chocolate shop. But this month, a separate investigation by federal police concluded there was no evidence of money laundering in Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s property deals. As a state deputy, the president\u2019s son was instrumental in N\u00f3brega being given a medal by the assembly while he was imprisoned under suspicion of homicide. N\u00f3brega was later cleared."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
