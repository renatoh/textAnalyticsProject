As a child he saw it on his grandfather\u2019s writing desk and later, when he was a struggling writer, his grandmother gave it to him. \u201cClick-clacking\u201d on the old typewriter \u201cstirred something\u201d in him: not only did he feel connected to his late grandfather, but the machine \u201cmade writing fun again\u201d. In spring 2013, he and his wife, Hilary, left their jobs in New York City and opened the Literati Bookstore in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Ann Arbor has a proud tradition of independent bookshops: it once had more per capita than any other US city. The original Borders was opened there by Tom and Louis Borders in 1971. But it closed in 2011, amid doom-laden newspaper headlines predicting the death of the high-street bookshop. Friends told them they were crazy: \u201cHow can you survive if Borders couldn\u2019t?\u201d But although they admitted to being \u201cterrified\u201d, the Gustafsons were not deterred. This was personal: \u201cOpening a community-minded independent bookstore was a dream we\u2019d shared since we bonded over books on our first date.\u201d Literati\u2019s logo is a typewriter and his grandfather\u2019s Smith Corona is proudly displayed by the store\u2019s cash register. On the lower level of the shop, they set up a light blue Olivetti Lettera 32, inserted a clean sheet of white paper and left it there, \u201cthe world\u2019s smallest publishing house, waiting for an author\u201d. Gustafson admits that they did wonder whether people would even know how to use it. But at the end of the first day he saw the words \u201cThank you for being here\u201d. It was as if \u201cthe typewriter itself was thanking me\u201d. Since then, Literati\u2019s public typewriter has become part of the shop\u2019s identity. People have used it to propose, to admit fears, to apologise, to joke and to philosophise. Some of the best notes are put up on a wall behind the typewriter and used on the shop\u2019s social media account. The artist Oliver Uberti (the book\u2019s designer) has even painstakingly copied some on to the shop\u2019s brick walls using the exact font of the old Smith Corona, \u201csmudgy e\u2019s, q\u2019s, and all\u201d. The anonymous notes collected in this short but beautifully designed book offer ample evidence of the success of this \u201cpublic typewriter experiment\u201d. They range from the banal (\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d) and the amusing (\u201cmisspelling is a suign of genius\u201d), to the poignant: \u201cI spent 22 years telling her to do great things. Now that she has gone to do them I am sad.\u201d Some verge on the profound: \u201cLife, like this typewriter, has no backspace. Type strongly and don\u2019t look back.\u201d This is a delightfully quirky, heart-warming celebration of the \u201cmessy, smudgy, imperfect beauty\u201d of a past analogue era of ink, paper and mechanical keys. As a succinct note puts it: \u201ci love it when you talk typewriter to me\u201d. \u2022 Notes from a Public Typewriter by Michael Gustafson &amp; Oliver Uberti is published by Scribe (RRP \u00a39.99).
