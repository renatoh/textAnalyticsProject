There\u2019s a place that has been heavily attacked and bombarded,\u201d he wrote. The 29-year-old east Londoner, who had been in the country since December last year, had spent months ferrying the dead and injured to field hospitals in the country \u2013 in his own words, \u201cbloody, gruesome work\u201d far from his old life as an Indian takeaway delivery man in Whitechapel, east London. \u201c[They] need me here and my ambulance to take people out. Very risky mission but I love the feeling.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian, Bari, his elder brother, who has requested that the Guardian not reveal his true identity, reproached him repeatedly, saying it was time to come home \u2013 telling him he had \u201cdone his bit\u201d and had duties to his elderly widowed mother, wife and 17-month-old daughter. He replied: \u201cI have already done some mad missions. If we don\u2019t do it, then who will?\u201d Four weeks later, Kamran was killed, his older brother says, his body flattened under a building that collapsed after being struck in a barrage of Cruise missiles fired by the US at eight \u201cterrorist bases\u201d around Aleppo on the night of 22 September. The strikes were meant to decapitate the leadership of a hitherto largely unknown part of al-Qaida known as Khorasan, which the US claimed was planning attacks on the west. However, the raids apparently also claimed the lives of Kamran, two other east Londoners of Bangladeshi heritage, and a 19-year-old from Brighton, Ibrahim Kamara. Almost 24 hours after the attack, Bari was leaving a mosque in Stepney Green when he was taken aside by a member of the congregation and told his brother had been \u201cmartyred\u201d. \u201cI broke down. I started crying and could not stop. A couple of guys picked me up and sat me down. I was told it was 100% certain. I do blame the Americans for his death.\u201d In the next month, Bari sought out anyone who could tell him what had happened. \u201cMy mum kept asking for a picture. One guy told me: \u2018Your brother is under rubble, and even if there was a picture, he wouldn\u2019t look good\u2019.\u201d Kamran\u2019s friends insisted that he and the other \u201cBangladeshi boys\u201d had been \u201cfreelancing\u201d, servicing different groups fighting president Bashar al-Assad in Syria. One western analyst, who has been in and out of Syria this summer, told the Guardian the young men were most likely \u201cjihadi volunteers hanging around camps\u201d \u2013 hangers-on rather than true fighters. \u201cI imagine there could be a lot of those who have not sworn allegiance properly but are still tagging along with bigger groups.\u201d However, western jihadis in Syria, such as Amer Deghayes, claim that Kamran belonged to a group of British Bangladeshis who were \u201csimple fighters\u201d and, like the Brighton teenager Kamara, had joined Jabhat al-Nusra. The group is a Syrian affiliate of al-Qaida that has fought against both Assad and Islamic State (Isis) militants in the country\u2019s civil war. Bari, though, says otherwise. \u201cMy brother was never a fighter. He never mentioned picking up a gun. If he did join al-Nusra, it would have been because of Islamic State, who were killing people who didn\u2019t pledge allegiance to them. You had to join a group to get protection.\u201d Bari says Kamran, who was the most religious of four brothers, had decided to become involved in Syria after watching YouTube videos showing women and children being \u201cslaughtered\u201d in late 2011. He joined one of the first convoys out of London delivering tents, food and clothing to Syrians fleeing the civil war in March 2012. Kamran had been stopped by police leaving Britain at Dover, but allowed to travel on when he explained he was on a humanitarian mission. After a fortnight in Syria in 2012, Bari says, he came back \u201cmotivated and energised\u201d. As soon as he returned, however, the trouble began. First the police raided his family home taking phones and computers. Next, Kamran, who had thrown himself into charity work, was repeatedly thwarted in his attempts to return to Syria. Three times he travelled to the Turkish-Syrian border but was turned back. Kamran spent hours with police trying to \u201csort out his paperwork\u201d to get back to the relief camps. \u201cMy mum was getting wound up he wasn\u2019t getting a job. We told him to give up. Forget Syria you have done your bit, \u201d said Bari. The turning point came last November, when Kamran\u2019s father died and most of the family went to Bangladesh to bury him and sort out his affairs. While they were away, Kamran got the all-clear from the police to travel and joined another aid convoy. By December 2013 he was in Syria. Bari says his brother called him in February. \u201cKamran said he was learning to drive an ambulance. I kept telling him \u2018come back\u2019. He just said he needed a few months more.\u201d But Bari says his brother became trapped in Syria after he lost his passport. \u201cIn the summer I was telling him to come back because mum\u2019s crying, your wife\u2019s angry, and that\u2019s when he told me he had lost his passport. If he came back, he said, he would face prison. He was trapped.\u201d Cage, a group that campaigns on behalf of terror suspects allegedly denied legal rights and which advised the Haque family, says ministers need to \u201crethink their Syria strategy and take a more nuanced approach toward returnees\u201d. Amandla Thomas-Johnson, Cage\u2019s spokesman, said: \u201cThe government must provide a window of opportunity for Britons to return, because unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard of people trapped in the region wanting to come home.\u201d Bari, however, says that any change in policy will come too late. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a brother. He was a decent guy, not a troublemaker, even before he became religious. He would not pick up a gun to be an action hero.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
