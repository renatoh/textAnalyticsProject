First, Portuenses like to keep things simple: so, no fusion experiments. Second, it\u2019s as much about the people behind the food, as the food itself. \u201cFood is an expression of culture,\u201d says US-born Carly Petracco, who founded Taste Porto in 2013 with her Porto-born husband Miguel and his childhood buddy Andr\u00e9. \u201cWe like to show who\u2019s doing the cooking, who\u2019s serving the food, who\u2019s supplying the ingredients, and so on.\u201d She\u2019s good to her word. Walking the city with one of the six guides feels less like venue-hopping and more like dropping in for a catch-up with a series of food-loving, old friends. Everywhere you go (whether it\u2019s the Loja dos Past\u00e9is de Chaves cafe with its flaky pastries or the Flor de Congregados sandwich bar with its sublime slow-roasted pork special) the experience is as convivial as it is culinary. And it\u2019s not just food either. Taste Porto runs a Vintage Tour option that includes a final stop at boutique wine store, Touriga, where the owner David will willingly pair your palate to the perfect port. \u2022 Tours from \u20ac59pp, tours last 3-3\u00bd hours, tasteporto.com Oliver Balch Lisbon A single espresso first thing on an empty stomach is the secret to a long and healthy life. So says 93-year-old Carlos Pina, whose father founded coffee roastery Negrita in 1924 and who still works there. One of only two roasteries left in Lisbon, Negrita is in a former stables in the Gra\u00e7a neighbourhood and has survived because the family own the building: elsewhere across the city rising rents are forcing decades-old businesses to close. Gra\u00e7a and neighbouring Mouraria are still home to families who shop in local stores, making the two neighbourhoods ideal for Culinary Backstreets: its food tours aim to give visitors an insight into the city\u2019s history and culture. After breathing in the scent of coffee and roasted spices at Negrita, the tour takes in a traditional cerveceria for plates of clams, velvet crab and prego (steak sandwich). Then there\u2019s a shot of cherry liqueur at a local corner store and a takeaway grilled chicken eaten in the no-nonsense bar of a neighbourhood association \u2013 another fast-disappearing feature of old Lisbon. A contrast to these insights into old Lisbon is tiny A Taberna do Mar, which opened in 2018 opposite the church and convent of Gra\u00e7a. Here chef-owner Filipe Rodrigues combines his love of Japanese techniques, Portuguese produce and a passion for sustainability to create inventive dishes. Try samples of horse mackerel bone broth and smoked sashimi of yellow fin tuna. Even the pudding, based on traditional egg custard, has a hint of sardine. At \u20ac25 the 10-course tasting menu is a bargain and worth booking if you have another night in the city. \u2022 \u20ac115, tour lasts around 6 hours, culinarybackstreets.com Isabel Choat Berlin An influx of creative talent and relatively affordable startup costs have meant the German capital\u2019s restaurant scene has boomed in recent years. Per Meurling, the Swedish founder of Berlin Food Stories, and Liv Fleischhacker, a food writer and founder of Nosh Berlin, the city\u2019s only Jewish food festival, are here to help sift through the glut of dining options. Tours kick off at Markthalle Neun, a refurbished food hall in the Kreuzberg area, and encompass everything from a look at Berlin\u2019s thriving Turkish diaspora \u2013 with a stop for d\u00f6ner kebabs and other signature staples, of course \u2013 to German classics, such as eisbein (pickled ham hock) and k\u00f6nigsberger klopse (veal meatballs in cream sauce) at Max &amp; Moritz. The guides take turns leading tours but each offers insights on how the city\u2019s history has helped shape its gastronomic present. \u2022 \u20ac90pp, tours 3\u00bd hours, berlinfoodstories.com Diana Hubbell Barcelona More than mere culinary tours, Devour Barcelona\u2019s small-group sojourns dive into the history and culture of the city \u2013 and steer travellers towards lesser-known local haunts. On a morning stroll on the Tastes &amp; Traditions of Barcelona tour, visitors skip the hordes at Mercat de la Boqueria in favour of a more civilised breakfast of charcuterie, cheeses and cava at Bar Joan at Mercado de Santa Caterina. After more stops in the El Born neighbourhood, the tour winds toward Barceloneta for vermouth and bombas (meat-and-potato croquettes) at Bodega La Peninsular and squid ink-stained paella at Can Ramonet. In the evening, the Tapas, Taverns &amp; History tour delves into everything from the Spanish inquisition to the city war. The exact stops vary depending on the guide but may include a visit to Bodega La Palma for cider-braised pork cheeks or a glass of red straight from the barrel with flash-fried anchovies and cumin-scented butifarra sausage at La Plata, a barebones tapas joint that was a favourite of the late Anthony Bourdain. \u2022 Tours from \u20ac79pp, tours last 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd hours, devourbarcelonafoodtours.com DH Copenhagen The first thing visitors note about Copenhagen is the vast number of bicycles: 43% of all commutes are done by bike. So, it is not surprising that visitors want to explore the city by bike, too. If you master the art of pedalling you should give Foods of Copenhagen\u2019s culinary bike tour a spin as it involves exploring the less touristy areas of N\u00f8rrebro and Refshale\u00f8en. Cindie Christiansen founded the company three years ago and she takes guests to the hippest places in town. A tour might include modern, open-faced sandwiches at Selma, desserts at Winterspring, hotdogs from Kejser Sausage at the Bridge Street Kitchen and fermented potato fries at Tapperiet Brus. It also includes local drinks, such as Nordic ciders at R\u00f8dder &amp; Vin. Christiansen chooses places carefully, mixing street food and fine dining. All the food on the tour is consumed sitting down and eating a full dish rather than tastings. This makes for a longer tour but also for in-depth knowledge and a more sociable experience. \u2022 \u00a3144pp including bike rental (which is yours for the full day), foodsofcopenhagen.com Andrea Bak Naples Despite its history and culinary traditions, an outdated reputation keeps Naples off some travellers\u2019 Italian itineraries. Yet, Culinary Backstreets\u2019 tour \u2013 one of the newest among the company\u2019s global offerings \u2013 illustrates just how much there is to discover in this hypnotic city. The tour begins outside the old city walls in Porta Capuana with a mid-morning espresso, rum baba and sweet, ricotta-filled sfogliatelle. Next up is a third-generation baccaleria for samples of salt cod, a \u201chealing\u201d glass of sulphuric water from Vesuvius, and a bruschetta-like snack in the city\u2019s last traditional friselle bakery. The 10 stops on the five-hour tour offer much more than quick bites and photo-ops. The guides have fostered relationships with the bakers, vendors, and cooks who make this food scene unique, and this allows rare peeks into bakers\u2019 ovens and chats with artisans. A stroll among the buzzing stalls of a local market highlights a slice of Naples in an area many visitors are unlikely to see. The tour also hits the \u201cmust-sees\u201d \u2013 perfect for those on a tight schedule who don\u2019t want to miss tasting a Sorbillo pizza or a shot of limoncello. \u2022 \u20ac107pp, tour 5 hours, culinarybackstreets.com Will Vibert Palermo The Duchess of Palma \u2013 Nicoletta Lanza Tomasi \u2013 has a crash course in Sicilian cuisine and it begins with a tour of Palermo\u2019s Mercado del Capo. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise I knew so much about the city\u2019s history until I started teaching my cooking class to fund the upkeep of the palace,\u201d she says, working between her favourite spice merchant, fishmonger, shouty fruit and veg traders and stalls stacked with bags of pasta. Part food tour, part cooking masterclass, Cooking with the Duchess delves deep into the way Palermitans have eaten for centuries, from the Arab traders that first set up Mercado del Capo 1,000 years ago to the Jewish, Normans and Greeks that made this city the street-food capital of Europe. It also ends at Nicoletta\u2019s home, the cacti-lined 18th-century Palazzo Lanza Tomasi \u2013 a palace on the city\u2019s seafront, where the Duke\u2019s father, author Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, once sat to write the iconic novel, Il Gattopardo (The Leopard). \u201cI have always cooked traditional, Sicilian dishes to preserve the heritage of the island,\u201d says Nicoletta. The four-course menu changes seasonally but street-food inspired chickpea panelle, swordfish rolls and almond and pistachio pesto ruvidelli are examples of the recipes you can get hands on with in the palace kitchen, between herb foraging on the jasmine-laced terrazza and glasses of Sicilian wine. Then on to a tour of the palace and lunch with the Duke and Duchess in the grand banqueting hall. \u2022 \u20ac146, butera28.it Anastasia Miari ASIA Shanghai Untour\u2019s street eats breakfast tour starts with a tasting of three of Shanghai\u2019s four most popular breakfast foods, collectively known as the \u201cfour heavenly kings\u201d. There are crispy, oily, fried youtiao doughnuts, which are dipped into a freshly made sweetened soy milk that also helps wash down a dense cifantuan rice ball. This stodgy-and-satisfying Shanghainese dish combines white and red sticky rice, stuffed with salted duck egg and tart mustard pickles. These are enjoyed at Xiangcai Renjia, a Hunan-style restaurant that, in the morning, doubles as a breakfast joint, making use of the free seating to serve food made by the owners of the food stall next door. Next, the tour moves to the Xiangyang Road area of the Former French Concession, where visitors can sample pancakes, steamed buns and dumplings, all served from tiny holes in the wall. The classic jianbing, or Chinese crepe, is a fitting substitute for the sesame pancake that is traditionally the fourth \u201cheavenly\u201d breakfast item. Jianbing, which is best enjoyed straight off the griddle folded around egg, fried wonton skin, pickles and spicy sauce, can be traced back 2,000 years to north-east China but is now popular across the country as an on-the-go breakfast. Elsewhere, in a tiny sit-down place next door to the jianbing stall, there are rich and flavoursome pork-filled soup dumplings, served in a traditional bamboo steamer. Of course, breakfast in a city as cosmopolitan as Shanghai isn\u2019t all about tradition: trendy coffee shops also serve western-style choices with Chinese characteristics. At Egg, a cafe on nearby Xiangyang North Road, taste the brownie topped with peanut and numbing Sichuan peppercorns for a tingly, sweet contrast to the morning\u2019s savoury carb feast. \u2022 \u00a360pp, tour 3 hours, untourfoodtours.com Tess Humphrys Hong Kong Despite its name, there is more to Little Adventures\u2019 Wonton-a-thon tour than just a sampling of Hong Kong\u2019s iconic dumplings. Each itinerary is tailored to the tastes of the guests, and could include succulent roast goose or deftly carved duck; a dazzling array of dim sum in an old-school tea house; a jarring shot of snake wine; or learning the finer points of oolong appreciation with a celebrated tea master. Stops on recent tours include Lin Heung Kui and its array of morsels served from trolley-mounted steam tables and sizzling grills, or For Kee, a quintessential cha chaan teng, the Hong Kong equivalent of a greasy spoon diner, known for its pork chops. The tour is narrated by a member of the Little Adventures team, which includes founder and journalist Daisann McLane, a local chef, and some noted food writers. The guides are Cantonese-speaking culinary experts who beyond their infectious enthusiasm for the foods of the Fragrant Harbour \u2013 Hong Kong in Cantonese \u2013 share their encyclopaedic knowledge of the city they live in and love. \u2022 \u00a3125pp for half-day tour for a group of three. littleadventuresinhongkong.com Vincent Vichit-Vadakan Bangkok Skip the gloopy stir-fried noodles on the tourist-trap of Khao San Road and explore the intricacies of Thai cuisine with Chili Paste Tour\u2019s Chin Chongtong, a charismatic guide who has called Bangkok home for more than 15 years. Her Chili Paste day tours through Banglamphu, an especially atmospheric neighbourhood in Bangkok, include a street-food breakfast in an alleyway lined with historic shophouses, a stop for young coconut ice-cream from a vendor that has been making it for more than seven decades, lunch with a chef who pounds all of her curry pastes by hand, and a foray into Pak Khlong Talad, Bangkok\u2019s flower market. Meanwhile, the Thonburi Food &amp; Art Walk ventures further off the beaten track to the side of the Chao Phraya River where few travellers go. Sample traditional Thai sweets at a shop that has been making them for 80 years and delicacies such as fried snakehead fish at Wang Lang Market. \u2022 \u00a357pp, tours up to 6 hours, foodtoursbangkok.com DH Mumbai No Footprints Mumbai\u2019s Khau Gully (street food walk) offers a condensed taste of the city\u2019s street food, starting with the ubiquitous vada pao at the Aram vada pao stall at the grand CST railway station \u2013 serving spiced, mashed potato fritter, deep-fried, then pressed into pao (white bread) painted with chutney. A short saunter across is Mumbai\u2019s oldest surviving eatery, Pancham Puriwala, a magnet for migrant labourers drawn to its fluffy puris and gravied potatoes. In cacophonous Crawford Market, a five-minute walk away, is Badshah, serving its falooda (a colourful jumble of ice-cream, vermicelli noodles, jelly, rose syrup, nuts and basil seeds), the perfect cold drink for sun-charred Mumbai. Nearby is Kyani &amp;Co, Mumbai\u2019s oldest Irani cafe, specialising in all manner of meaty Parsi comestibles from masala-flecked mince to chicken patties to mutton cheese omelettes. Then onwards to Parsi Dairy Farm on Princess Street, purveyors of creamy kulfi (a sort of ice-cream made by simmering creamy milk for hours) and ghee-drenched sweetmeats. On Chowpatty beach, honeycombed with food shacks, taste pao bhaji: mashed vegetables in a bath of butter, and bhel (potatoes, onions, puri, puffed rice, with a wash of sweet-sour and spicy chutneys), and a dusting of sev (hair-thin strands of fried chickpea flour) on top. Those more stern of stomach can visit the nearby restaurant Soam for the same dishes in more salubrious, air-conditioned environs. Then to the Babulnath dosa vendor for cheese-slicked dosa and spring \u201cChinese\u201d dosa, the latter stuffed with capsicum, carrots, and skewered with soy and spicy schezwan sauce.

Today, little of that history remains but it has become known for its maze of narrow alleys, home to squat postwar buildings and the tiny restaurants, bars and cafes they contain. The night-time tour by Tokyo Memories through the neighbourhood is led by Simon Berry, an Englishman who\u2019s lived in Sangenjaya for the last decade. Berry guide guests through a couple of favourites: Takomasu, a street-side takoyaki (fried octopus ball) stall that sells takoyaki \u201csandwiches\u201d; Ogata, where guests make monjayaki, a cabbage-filled pancake. Then it\u2019s into the alleys, to Omasu, a kushikatsu restaurant owned by baseball fanatic Yoshi-san (kushikatsu is deep fried skewers of meat and vegetables). It\u2019s easy to get lost in these alleys but Berry navigates them confidently to Kiura, a sake bar behind a sliding door disguised as a shop\u2019s back wall. After the oil-heavy kushikatsu, it\u2019s a welcome change and a strong finish to the tour. The sake is refreshingly light and the food menu stretches from sashimi to a plate of lightly boiled, garlic-covered edamame. \u2022 \u00a3100pp, tour 4 hours, tokyo-memories.com Oscar Boyd Vientiane, Laos When the French settled into Vientiane amid the heat on the middle Mekong in 1893, they puffed on opium, before a smoking ban reignited colonial passion and planning. They resurrected the City of Sandalwood, razed by marauding Siamese in 1827, with French shuttered buildings, uprighted the broken Buddha effigies, and ventured south to plant coffee. Today, the Lao capital is perfumed with roasting coffee from the dozens of cafes in low-slung buildings drawing down to the river. Tuk Tuk Safari guide Ere will take you by tuk tuk from the main streets to a stall where aproned ladies pour water through single-origin Lao coffee in cloth filters \u2013 producing an intensely earthy caffeine punch. Breakfast may be aromatic khao lam (sticky rice, coconut milk, and taro stuffed in bamboo), lifted off the coals by a family grilling 90 tubes in their front yard each morning. Then comes a lunch of kao piak sen (tapioca noodle soup with chicken, flavoured with kaffir lime leaves, galangal, garlic, lemongrass and padek; Lao fermented fish sauce), and then a trip to a tiny DIY green papaya salad roadside cafe where you\u2019ll grind the chillis that give Lao\u2019s fiery tham mak hoong its reputation. \u2022 \u00a360pp for full-day tour, tuktuksafari.com Claire Boobbyer Hanoi Once you love Vietnam, you\u2019ll love its food forever, too.

Several times a month, Nosh Walks\u2019 Myra Alperson encourages travellers to ditch the hotdogs at Times Square and follow her instead on one of 35 neighbourhood walks in search of Sri Lankan curries in Staten Island or Georgian baked goods in Bay Ridge, or richly spiced Trinidadian dishes in the Bronx. Of particular note are her tours of Greenpoint, a historically Polish neighbourhood on the northern Brooklyn waterfront, in which participants swing by Acme Smoked Fish Factory, which is only open to the public one day a week, and Pyza, a traditional restaurant serving cheese blintzes worthy of a Polish grandmother. \u2022 $54pp, tours from 3 hours, noshwalks.com DH Mexico City This city of eternal spring almost never sees a day without sun, so what better way to take a taco tour than by bicycle. El Taco Club leads small groups (up to 10) through the parks, art-deco buildings and colourful markets of the city\u2019s chic Roma, Condesa and Polanco neighbourhoods to find delicious tacos at hole-in- the-wall taquerias and street stands. The tour, which varies according to season and day of the week, might include a restaurant where patrons are serenaded by strolling musicians, offering a speciality of central Mexico, barbacoa, which is tender mutton wrapped in agave leaves and roasted in its own juices in an outdoor pit. Or a market stall serving cochinita pibil: slow-cooked suckling pig from the Yucatan marinated in a crimson chilli and achiote paste. A small street stand prepares brisket, tender enough to make any grandmother proud.

Callao is one of the best spots on Peru\u2019s 2,414km coastline to eat ceviche, and Freddy Alarc\u00f3n\u2019s Combi Roja (red van) is one of the places to try Peru\u2019s flagship dish. Freddy has been cooking on wheels for more than 30 years. With ready smile he can prepare a hake ceviche at lightning speed and diners can sit and eat in the specially adapted van on fake leather seats. Next stop is El Colorao de Chucuito, run by Andr\u00e9s Angeles, a former merchant marine who has created 20 of his own dishes. His specialities are muchame de at\u00fan, layers of dried tuna fish served with avocado and olive oil, and swordfish in sea snail sauce. In Callao all roads lead to La Punta, a peninsula that juts out into the Pacific, lined with pastel-hued art-deco homes. At its end is Don Giuseppe\u2019s eponymous eatery, owned by an older Genoa-born seaman who met his love on the Peruvian coast and decided to stay.

Besides pushing waistline boundaries with abundant servings of meat, this three-hour walking tour also opens the doors to unexpected Buenos Aires corners, revealing low-profile but authentic bodegones (taverns) and steakhouses in Palermo and San Telmo. The first mouthful is legendary Argentine hot sausage sandwich chorip\u00e1n, taken at 120-year-old La Ca\u00f1ita, a former store dating back to when sugar cane grew in this neighbourhood. Unusually, La Ca\u00f1ita\u2019s chori is made from beef rather than pork and homemade chimichurri sauce is the standard topping. Next is pizzeria La Guitarrita (though it also serves empanadas). Here, hand-cut whole-knuckle beef pasties win out over pies, paired with fragrant Torront\u00e9s white wine. The real parrilla deal is revealed at stop three. The sign on this secret spot\u2019s door says \u201ccerrado\u201d (closed) but Antonella knows better. Here, asador Albertito Odetti tends to slabs of Argentina\u2019s prized beef, grill hood decorated with swirly fileteado letters. It\u2019s a legit hole in the wall, with star dishes scrawled on A4 and stuck to windows; there\u2019s puffy provoleta (cheese), hand-cut chips, malbec and a token salad, which are worthy companions to 800g of medium-rare bife de chorizo and entra\u00f1a (to share).
