Instead of encouraging him and his dedicated team, the county officials and then the state sought to close down his unconventional operations. Eventually he lost his licences to practise locally and nationally. But the bureaucrats and legislators changed their tune and started to sing green songs when Reynolds came to the rescue of the homeless of Indonesia and the Andaman Islands after the tsunami and of Mexican peasants after Hurricane Katrina. An impressive man, a fascinating story, though the current Chinese earthquake isn't good news for anyone proposing that strict rules on building standards be relaxed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
