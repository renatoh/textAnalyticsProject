On Friday, the Washington Post reported that raids on Sunday would target up to 2,000 families in as many as 10 cities. Among the cities reportedly to be targeted Los Angeles and San Francisco. Activists sprang into action, making sure families knew their rights and understood that they did not have to open the door to officers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice. Families kept children close, sought other places to stay and prayed for the best. Local officials, especially in sanctuary cities that have vowed never to assist immigration officials, condemned the planned raids and voiced their support for migrant communities. \u201cIt is unconscionable that the federal administration is targeting innocent immigrant families with secret raids that are designed to inflict as much fear and pain as possible,\u201d San Francisco mayor London Breed said in a statement. In his own statement, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti said: \u201cNo Angeleno should ever have to fear being snatched from their home or separated from their loved ones \u2013 we are doing everything we can to provide immigrant families with info and support ahead of the announced Ice deportation sweeps.\u201d San Jose mayor Sam Liccardo said that his city rejected \u201cthis administration\u2019s politics of fear and exclusion, which is tearing our families apart. It\u2019s important for all members of our San Jose community \u2013 regardless of immigration status \u2013 to know they have rights and that our San Jose police department will not participate in any Ice investigation or enforcement activity.\u201d And then, with just a tweet, Trump announced the raids would be delayed for two weeks. Activists and community leaders said that put them back in an all too familiar position. \u201cHe\u2019s done this before,\u201d Father Richard Smith, a San Francisco clergy leader and immigration activist, told the Guardian. \u201cPart of his strategy clearly is to incite fear among a vulnerable community that is already in fear. It\u2019s death by a thousand cuts.\u201d Smith is part of an action network that supports migrant families, including by getting witnesses to areas where Ice agents have been spotted to provide support to anyone being detained and to intervene when possible. The past few years have been particularly hard on young children in immigrant families, Smith said. He recalled a situation in which a four-year-old girl was walking down the street with her mother and spotted a San Francisco police officer. The child started to scream: \u201cMami, run!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the sort of fear and trauma that Trump likes to stir up,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAll we can do is keep our eyes and hearts open and respond as best we can at the time. It\u2019s hard to predict because he keeps changing it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
