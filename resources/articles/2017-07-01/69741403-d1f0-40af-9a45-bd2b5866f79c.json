In his final speech at the annual Mansion House dinner for judges, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd blasted government delays in negotiating a settlement to protect Britain\u2019s \u00a325.7bn a year legal industry. Addressing the white-tie event, the outgoing lord chief justice said: \u201cIt is essential for the UK that we work with the EU to ensure that there is a simple and flexible regime for the mutual recognition of enforcement of judgments for the future. \u201cMany months have elapsed since these points were made clear by the judiciary and the legal profession to Her Majesty\u2019s Government. There is no reason for further delay. \u201cThe common good and the national interest demand no less than the clearest commitment by Her Majesty\u2019s Government on these issues. It is an essential support for the continued position and promotion of our laws, our courts, our judges, our arbitration centres and our legal profession and, of course, the major contribution they make to national prosperity, both in their own right and in the essential support of the financial services industry.\u201d The new justice secretary, David Lidington, was present at the dinner. Lord Thomas is due to retire in the coming months. His comments suggest there is considerable frustration over government failures to protect the UK\u2019s position as an international legal centre. How the European court of justice in Luxembourg \u2013 the EU\u2019s highest court \u2013 and the UK courts will deal with each other\u2019s decisions is emerging as one of the key Brexit battlegrounds. Remainers and soft Brexiters are urging ministers to ensure that there will be close cooperation, if not continued recognition of rulings to ensure businesses that trade with the EU are operating on equal terms. For Brexiters, however, it is a fundamental demand that the UK should be entirely free from the Luxembourg\u2019s court jurisdiction. Thomas also pointed out that last Thursday the EU published interim arrangements on applicable law, jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments. \u201cIt is not necessary for me to say how it is ... urgent and important to have certainty about these interim arrangements,\u201d the lord chief justice added. He is is the second senior judge in recent days to speak about the consequences of Brexit for the legal profession. Lord Neuberger, the outgoing president of the supreme court, gave a conference of visiting Australian lawyers a more upbeat assessment earlier this week. He said: \u201cWe are determined that the United Kingdom\u2019s forthcoming exit from the European Union will in no way undermine London\u2019s status as the world centre for legal services generally and dispute resolution in particular. \u201cThe common law, which is so attuned to the needs and realities of the commercial world, will remain as attuned to the demands of international business as it ever was. Indeed, left, once again, to our own common law devices, we will in some respects be able to react more quickly and freely to developments in our fast-changing world. Brexit does not alter the fact that lawyers and judges in the UK are as internationally minded and expert as they ever have been.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
