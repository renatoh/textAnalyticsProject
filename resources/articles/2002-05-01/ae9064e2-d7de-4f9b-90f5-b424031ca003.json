Corks are pulled, delicate morsels consumed, and in between time matches are there to be enjoyed in the sun. But yesterday it rained on the parade. Worse still it was cold, and the only things that should be chilled at Roland Garros are the white wine and the Beaujolais. It did not rain all the time but the severity of the showers thoroughly disjointed the whole of the opening day, frustrating both players and public alike. The deepest of gloom was reserved for Pete Sampras who was beaten 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 by Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi. It was sad, but really not much of a surprise. Since reaching the semi-finals in 1996 the American, who has never won the French Open, has since failed to get beyond the third round in six attempts. Indeed, this was the second time he has lost in the first round during the last three years. Sampras's clay court form coming into the tournament was virtually non-existent, and the conditions were totally against him. In 1994 he defeated Gaudenzi on the way to winning the Italian Open. In those days he had high expectations of completing grand-slam victories on all surfaces, but such hopes were pretty much dead five years ago. Sampras has been without a title of any sort since winning Wimbledon in 2000, and now resembles a boxer who has taken just one too many punches. At least Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten, the reigning champion, could allow himself a smile. He received the warmest of ovations as he began his defence just after mid-day, and duly polished off Switzerland's Ivo Heuberger without needing to raise a sweat, should that have been possible. Lleyton Hewitt, the world No1 and reigning US Open champion, also came through his first round match but with something less than brio. The heavy conditions and slow courts did not suit him, and he struggled before overcoming Brazil's Andre Sa 7-5, 6-4, 7-5. The Australian has abandoned his back-to-front baseball hat in favour of a short haircut and headband, but he remains instantly recognisable. The same cannot be said for Sweden's Thomas Johansson, the most anonymous of grand-slam champions. His victory at the Australian Open this year is inked into the record books, but incredulity lingers on. His record at Roland Garros is little short of appalling, with yesterday's first round victory over Franco Squillari only his third French Open win in seven visits. Squillari was a semi-finalist here two years ago, so Johansson was understandably pretty pleased with his victory. \"I felt very, very strong on court. I had the same feeling in Melbourne, so now I've just got to win six more matches.\" He laughed, recognising the improbability. It was equally improbable that Britain's Martin Lee, playing in his first French Open, would be able to overcome Romania's Andrei Pavel, the No 22 seed, but Lee's debut was cut short by the recurrence of a groin injury when he was trailing 6-1, 5-4. There had been signs in the second set that the British No3 was getting to grips with the match, and he was obviously extremely dejected at having to pull out, but he hopes to be fit for Wimbledon. Tim Henman, the No6 seed, opens up today against Galo Blanco, the Spaniard having won their only previous meeting four years ago on clay. Venus Williams displayed no signs of her recent wrist injury during a 6-3, 6-3 first round victory over Bianka Lamade of Germany. It was the day's first match on court Philippe Chatrier, the main court at Roland Garros, when the sun was still shining, and it was still possible to watch tennis without two sweaters, a scarf and an empty bottle of Beaujolais filled with hot water."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
