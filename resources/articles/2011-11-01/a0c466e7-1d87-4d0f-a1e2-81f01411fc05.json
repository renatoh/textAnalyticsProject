The Church of England was initially incapable of answering it, after Occupy London campers pitched up in the backyard of its City pied-\u00e0-terre. Its great difficulty was with a prior question: which sort of thing are you \u2013 a building or a movement? Most churches are a bit of both, and the temptation to identify with the bricks and mortar is particularly strong when they are as glorious as at St Paul's. The cathedral's move to threaten eviction on health and safety grounds certainly suggested it was leaning that way. But after three resignations \u2013 the last from the dean himself \u2013 the contrary view has prevailed. The church has rightly decided to grapple with the question of the demonstration from the perspective of a moral community as opposed to that of a property management company. The process of reaching this verdict has been every bit as shambolic as the sight of the protesting tents. Whichever canny demonstrator hit on the \"What would Jesus do?\" banner inspired ecclesiastical soul-searching. Giles Fraser's resignation showed where he thought the Messiah would stand, and as a wave of sympathy crashed through the church, the dean recognised that his hard line was being overwhelmed. Next power passed to the bishop of London, Richard Chartres, and it fell to this instinctive conservative to announce that the church would not after all push for eviction. Messy as the saga has been, it is only fair to acknowledge that this has been a rather principled mess. The Fraser resignation is one example of that, but so too was the dean's decision to go: he recognised that the policy needed to change, and that he had forfeited the credibility to accomplish this. The contrast with temporal politics is shaming \u2013 especially after Liam Fox floated a comeback for himself this week. Easy commentary bemoaning a lack of leadership from Lambeth Palace overlooks the reality that there has been principle, too, in Rowan Williams' silence \u2013 a principled respect for devolved power in his church. For him to have weighed in and dictated tactics to the dean would have been to play a Protestant pope \u2013 like David Cameron seeking to instruct Alex Salmond on Scottish education policy. Having pursued ethical economics ever since the crash, an interest refreshed in a Financial Times article today, Rowan Williams is now well placed to get involved with the Occupy London debates. The protesters, meanwhile, now face a Conservative home secretary and the sub-democratic Corporation of London ranged against them. And all parties are a little clearer about which side they are on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
