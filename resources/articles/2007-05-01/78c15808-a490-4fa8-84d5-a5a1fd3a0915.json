Cullen's Warrington were booed off after a 17-4 defeat to Harlequins, their fifth defeat in seven home league games this season. Warrington's Adrian Morley is likely to face a disciplinary hearing for a high tackle on Quins substitute Julien Rinaldi. Harrison, who became Salford coach in June 2002 - two months earlier than Cullen returned to Warrington - saw his City Reds side thrashed 66-6 by the Catalans Dragons, leaving them four points adrift at the foot of the table. Justin Murphy scored three tries and Adam Mogg two more for the Dragons, who are now on the fringe of the play-off positions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
