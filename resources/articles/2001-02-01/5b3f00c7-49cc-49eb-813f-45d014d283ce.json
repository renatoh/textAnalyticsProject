The former goalkeeper plans to sell his 1966 World Cup winners' medal, his England cap from that tournament, the cap awarded to him for the 1970 World Cup finals, a shirt given to him by the former West Germany goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski and aWorld Cup-winning team-mate Sir Bobby Charlton. Banks said he was not selling the mementoes for financial reasons but was following in the footsteps of the 1966 hat-trick scorer Geoff Hurst, who has also sold possessions from his collection. Meanwhile, Coventry have moved quickly to sign their former trainee goalkeeper Chris Kirkland and head off Liverpool's interest in the promising 19-year-old. His new contract ties him to Highfield Road for 5 years. Coventry's manager Gordon Strachan enthused: \"I think it's absolutely fantastic. He is a level-headed young man with immense talent and we are all absolutely delighted.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
