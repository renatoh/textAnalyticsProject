He's been wooed back by the newly reinstated executive producer, John Yorke, who himself was brought back last month to revive the soap's fortunes. Steve, who plays thuggish Phil Mitchell, was last seen on screen Christmas Day 2003, when he went on the run from the law, after being set up by Dirty Den in a gangland heist. In characteristically hard-man style he only had a few succinct words to say about his comeback. \"I can't wait to get back to EastEnders and settle a few scores,\" he said. Steve has kept a fairly low profile since leaving the soap, doing some TV presenting work on Sky One's Britain's Hardest gameshow series and a stint in panto as Captain Hook, in Milton Keynes. But it is believed Mr Yorke, who is controller of continuing drama, wooed him back after taking control of the soap last week - he replaced executive producer Kathleen Hutchison, who only lasted four fraught months on the show. Since Yorke's appointment, it has already been confirmed that Barbara Windsor, who plays feisty Peggy Mitchell, is set to return to the show at the end of the summer. Now all that remains is for Yorke to secure the return of Ross Kemp in the role of Grant Mitchell, Phil's equally hard brother, and the Mitchell family will be able to take their rightful place behind the bar of the Queen Vic once more. The EastEnders press office has not denied that Ross Kemp has been seen attending meetings at Elstree, where the show is filmed. But they have flatly denied that Gillian Taylforth, now starring in ITV1's Footballer's Wives, will be coming back to the show as Phil's estranged wife Kathy. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
