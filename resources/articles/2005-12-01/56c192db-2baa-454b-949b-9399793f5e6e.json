Christmas carols", "bodyText": "All Christmas carols are sentimental - but the best of them have a dash of astringency which raises them above the level of religious pop songs with their harmless but undemanding insistence on tidings of comfort and joy. One such is the setting of Christina Rossetti's words In The Bleak Midwinter which has achieved the apparently impossible feat this year of toppling Silent Night from first place in the annual poll conducted by that indefatigable TV stalwart, the BBC's Songs of Praise. After the triumph of Bleak House, now the laurels go to a Bleak Midwinter. Is there a touch of austerity in the air, perhaps? A feeling that the natural disasters of the past year make simple jollification misplaced? What is certainly true is that Rossetti's poem, which was never intended to be belted out before mince-pies or midnight Mass, is shot through with melancholy; written as though by one of the world's poor, surrounded by barren earth and unusable water. It could be the anthem of any believer, of any faith, in Sri Lanka, New Orleans or Pakistan. Like all successful songs, it also owes its victory to the music, in this case to two almost equally popular settings, one by the socialist composer Gustav Holst, and the organist Harold Darke. Both combine the natural delight inspired by a birth with the ache of knowing what may, and in the Christmas case, what would happen to the child. A good choice for celebrations which recognise the power of misfortune and evil, but which refuse to allow the devil the best tunes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
