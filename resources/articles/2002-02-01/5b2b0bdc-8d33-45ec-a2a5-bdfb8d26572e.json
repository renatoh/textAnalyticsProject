Johnson, a 25-year-old Swede, looks nothing like a Swede either, being on the small side of diminutive and ginger-haired to boot. Despite admitting \"golf has become so physical and you have to work out\", he weighs just under 10 stone and stands no more than 5ft 7in. But this was a day when appearances did not matter and for a player ranked 369th in the world and 112th in Europe he dealt with the pressures of winning as if he had been doing it all his career. Instead it was his first professional victory and, because this event was played to a modified Stableford format, it qualifies him for the only other such tournament in the world, the International in Denver, Colorado. He won \u00a3118,676 yesterday and could win another \u00a3500,000 if successful in America. Johnson had to contend with the challenge of Craig Parry, who only a month ago was doing a Tiger-taming act, beating Woods when winning the New Zealand Open. But the round turned on the long 14th, where Johnson had the luck a winner needs and Parry did not. The Swede struggled throughout the hole and then knocked in a 20ft birdie putt, whereas Parry hit three good shots to three feet and missed. Nick Dougherty won, by a wide margin, the battle between three of the world's most promising players. The 22-year-old American Bryce Molder failed the make the cut, Aaron Baddeley, at 20 already twice a winner of the Australian Open, gathered only 25 points in total, but the 19-year-old from Lancashire had a final-round 66, worth 14 points for a total of 34. That hurtled Dougherty up the leader board into 14th place but was not good enough to get him automatically into the next event, the Caltex Singapore Masters, co-sanctioned by the European Tour, in two weeks' time. He is currently 11th in line for a place in Singapore. \"It's doing my head in,\" he said yesterday, \"not playing in weeks when there's a tournament I want to play in.\" It hurts the worse because three weeks ago he was playing well enough to record his best finish as a professional, eighth in the Johnnie Walker Classic, and he has played well again this past week. Dougherty set a target of \"at least 14 points\" for yesterday's round and matched it exactly. It could have been better, too, given that he drove the 339-yard 13th hole and then three-putted, missed a birdie putt of six feet at the 16th and failed to birdie the long 17th. He now has a week off and intends to explore the Sydney beaches. \"There's 10 of us,\" he said, \"in two apartments. It could be the end of my career.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
