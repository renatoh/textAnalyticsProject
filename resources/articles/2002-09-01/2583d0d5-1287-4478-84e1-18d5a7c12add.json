The law commission's proposals, which are likely to be included in a new housing bill next year, would remove a key area of discrimination against same-sex couples under current law. At the moment, in most rented homes, only a husband or wife has the right to take over the tenancy of their home after the death of their spouse. Under the new proposals, this right of succession would be extended to cohabiting couples, including same-sex couples. The right would also apply if either partner had undergone a sex change. The proposals come after a landmark judgment in the House of Lords in 1999 in favour of Martin Fitzpatrick in his dispute with a housing association. He argued successfully that he had a right to take over the tenancy after the death of his homosexual partner, with whom he had lived for 18 years. The immediate effect of that judgment was limited, because Fitzpatrick lived in a \"fair-rent\" home, which meant that only same-sex couples in similar properties could claim the same right to take their partner's tenancy. Under the new proposals, however, that right would apply to all housing association, council and some private rented homes in England. Similar proposals in Scotland became law last year. The commission also proposes to give children the right to take over their parent's home even after the tenancy has already passed from one parent to another. At present, a family only has one succession right, which is used up when one parent dies and the tenancy passes to the surviving parent. The new proposal would give families two succession rights. It would remove the anxiety that children face about losing their family home at a time when they are often caring for a frail parent. Russell Campbell, chief solicitor of homelessness charity Shelter, says that reform is long overdue. \"It would make domestic law consistent with human rights legislation and catches up with trends in society.\" A spokeswoman for Stonewall, the gay rights campaign, adds: \"We are very pleased that the law commission is supporting equal rights for same-sex couples in this way. It is something we have been campaigning very hard for.\" Martin Partington, the law commissioner in charge of housing, says: \"The current law on the joint occupation of rented homes, the transfer of rights from one tenant to another, and what happens on the death of a tenant is a complete mess.\" \u00b7 Renting Homes 2: Co-occupation, Transfer and Succession is at: www.lawcom.gov.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
