Best up was the blue-riband event the Grand Challenge Cup, as Holland snatched a slender lead over world bronze medallists Germany and never let them get back on terms, winning by three-quarters of a length. With four men back from last year, the Dutch have moved up from eighth in the rankings. They now meet the British national eight, who were fifth behind Munich World Cup winners Germany in May, and who were far too strong for Russia's Marine Technical University. Britain's women's eight, fifth in the world last year, were overwhelmed by a rampaging USA that had finished just one place ahead of them in Gifu. The Americans, racing as the Princeton Training Centre, broke the course record by an astonishing 12 seconds and finished a comfortabletwo-and-half lengths ahead. They now meet Holland, bronze medallists last year, in today's final. University of London led Leander's quadruple scullers, breaking records all the way, until the last few strokes when they were caught by one foot on the line. With high-quality scullers in both boats, they have made a strong case for selecting a British quad to race at next month's World Championships. In the Lady's Plate semi-finals for noninternational men's eights there were two great battles with Leander/Molesey beating an Oxford University/Oxford Brookes combination by three-quarters of a length and America's Princeton University winning against West-coast compatriots Stanford University by over two lengths. In the Princess Elizabeth Cup it was Britain against America in both semifinals. The King's School Chester put out Phillips Andover but Britain's fastest school Shrewsbury could not contain US youth champions St Ignatius who came in two-thirds of a length ahead in a pulsating finish. Britain's world fours champions have a straight final today against the Dutch world silver-medal crew they beat by a few feet in Munich. It will be a chance to test their new seating line-up ahead of next month's world championships on Dorney Lake at Eton. The women's quadruple scullers, also world champions, sculled away from Leander and Mortlake Anglian yesterday and can also expect little resistance from the students of University of London today. In the forthcoming Lucerne World Cup final round, Germany will provide far tougher opposition. The current world double scull champions from Slovenia, Iztok Cop and Luka Spik, face a strong challenge in today's final from Britain's Matthew Wells and Steve Rowbotham who finished third in the Poznan World Cup round. Both had to deal with potentially awkward opponents yesterday, but in the event the Slovenians were much too quick for Norway and the British outpowered the Hungarian world lightweight champions. Oxford Boat Race winners Barney Williams and Paul Daniels face Munich World Cup winners Nikola Stojic and Goran Jagar this afternoon in the pairs. Both had easy semi-final races yesterday. Williams will be remembered as the stroke of the Canadian four which lost a spectacular Olympic final by inches to Matthew Pinsent's crew in Athens. With current world eights champion Daniels behind him, they hope to upset the experienced pair specialists from Serbia and Montenegro. In sweltering sunshine, the boaters were out as diamond sculls favourite Mahe Drysdale, New Zealand's reigning world champion, eased away from lightweight local boy Will Hoodless to set up a final tomorrow against Cambridge sculler Charlie Palmer. In the women's event Sophie Balmary of France, third in Munich, will face the world lightweight champion Marit van Eupen of Holland, both winning comfortably yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
