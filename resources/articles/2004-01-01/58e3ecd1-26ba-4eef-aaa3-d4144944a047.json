But not everyone finds it so easy to disguise their displeasure, as the players of Telford United proved today during the draw for the fourth round of the FA Cup. With the cameras trained on them, Telford whooped and hollered with glee as they were drawn at home. But the minute they were paired with Millwall, their heads fell and their mouths loudly emitted syllables such as \"naaah\", \"aaawww\" and \"faaaaak\". \"Millwall is going to be a difficult tie for us, but obviously we were looking for a Premiership team like Manchester United or Liverpool,\" said midfielder Fitzroy Simpson, not even bothering. There was more disappointment elsewhere. Liverpool won't be able to get away with that sort of nonsense again at home to Newcastle - \"It should be a great football match as they are both attacking sides,\" said Ian Rush, who clearly hasn't seen etc Liverpool etc recently and so on - while poor Middlesbrough are out, travelling to Hat-trick Seeking Arsenal(TM) as they do. However, HSA are no longer favourites for the Cup, as the bookies fully expect 100-30 Manchester United to (a) go to either Northampton or Rotherham and win, and (b) bother fielding a full-strength team at some point during the subsequent rounds. Meanwhile managerless and soon-to-be-Kanouteless-in-more-ways-than-one Tottenham have a difficult task travelling to either Leicester or Manchest... ach, we'll be here all day! The following list will have to suffice. And there's no point pulling that long face; dissatisfaction doesn't register with us any more. THE FULL DRAW Manchester City or Leicester v Tottenham Hotspur Swansea v Preston or Reading Northampton or Rotherham v Manchester United Kidderminster or Wolves v West Ham Arsenal v Middlesbrough Coventry v Accrington Stanley or Colchester Ipswich v Sunderland Luton v Tranmere or Bolton Liverpool v Newcastle Burnley v Gillingham Nottingham Forest v Sheffield United Portsmouth v Barnsley or Scunthorpe Everton v Fulham Telford v Millwall Southend or Scarborough v Watford or Chelsea Birmingham v Wimbledon or Stoke (Matches to be played January 24 or 25) QUOTE OF THE DAY \"The players realise the most important thing for the club is the Premiership\" - Eddie Gray successfully puts a positive spin on Leeds' FA Cup defeat. Successful, until you think about what will happen come May. HUGO IN FOR A CHALLENGE, I GO DOWN Here's something you probably didn't know: Australia have never won an Olympic diving gold medal. Yes, you read that right: N-E-V-E-R. Most experts, however, believe this cheering statistic will change in Athens 2004. And the Fiver is inclined to agree - especially after marvelling at one of their countrymen performing an exquisite forward tumble with half twist during Liverpool's 2-0 win at Yeovil. And Harry Kewell - for it was he - seemed pretty impressed too, apparently telling Yeovil defender Hugo Rodrigues: \"Yeah, I know you didn't [foul me] but this is football, man. I had to dive.\" But wait! Today, in the sort of reversal that would leave even Britney Spears gasping, Kewell denied muttering anything of the sort. \"I've got nothing to be ashamed about,\" he told liverpoolfc.tv, thankfully without adding an irritating \"but\" at the end of every sentence. \"If you look at the situation, he's touched me. If a defender touches a striker in the box it's a penalty. I don't know what he has to complain about. He came up to me during the game and asked me why I dived. I said to him 'Did you touch me?' And he said yes.\" Kewell was soon backed up by his agent, Bernie Mandic, who insisted - apparently with a straight face - that \"Australians never normally pick up habits like that anyway\", which will come as news to anyone sledged by their cricket team. Still, Kewell won't be taking legal action. \"It's a free country and he can say what he wants but I'm not going to lose any sleep over it,\" claimed Harry. \"I wouldn't dive. It's not fair on the opposition. I'd never consider trying to con the referee.\" That wouldn't been the same Harry Kewell who dived at Derby in 1999 to earn a penalty which put Leeds top of the Premiership - Sun headline: \"Conman Kewell!\" - would it? What? Eh? Oh. THE RUMOUR MILL'S THREE-RUMOURS-TWO-TEAMS SPECIAL Middlesbrough think the answer to their goal-scoring woes is... what? It says here Mr Em!!! United Arab Emirates coach Roy Hodgson has made a pre-emptive strike for the job by calling Spurs \"one of England's top clubs\". Somebody's been spending too much time in that Middle-Eastern sun. Meanwhile, David Pleat is sniffing round Wimbledon's Nigel Reo-Coker and West Brom's Jason Koumas like a flea-ridden dog on heat. NEWS IN BRIEF Rio Ferdinand curled his lip in concentration today to read the FA's written reasons for imposing an eight-month ban, which were sent to him after Manchester United requested them as a blatant delaying tactic. He now has two weeks to decide whether or not to appeal. Bolton have completed the loan signing of Javi Moreno from Atletico Madrid, subject to a medical. Expect more blustering from Sepp Blatter soon, as all eyes turn to Fifa in the debate over goal-line cameras, the other pointless furore to emerge from the weekend's FA Cup action. Feyenoord have confirmed that Ruud Gullit will take over at the end of the season, at which opportune moment Gullit decided to reveal his equally opportune life-long ambition: \"I have always had the desire to work as coach at Feyenoord.\" And a magazine prize offering a day's pigeon-shooting with Vinnie Jones was being reviewed today after he had his firearms licence revoked. Shooting Times said it was considering what to do about the offer - which is the second prize in a competition (two days first prize etc) - made before the court case last month in which Jones was convicted of an air-rage attack.
