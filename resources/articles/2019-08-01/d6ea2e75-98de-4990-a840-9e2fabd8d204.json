Lana Wachowski, who created the franchise with her sister Lilly, will also return as director, along with the original cast member Carrie-Anne Moss. \u201cMany of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality are even more relevant now,\u201d Wachowski said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to have these characters back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my brilliant friends.\u201d The script is co-written by Wachowski alongside the sci-fi novelists Aleksandar Hemon and David Mitchell. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the original Matrix, which told the story of the hacker Neo and his discovery that the world was in fact a simulated reality. It was a surprise hit, making more than $460m worldwide and launching two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The franchise has made more than $1.6bn. Rumours of a new film have been circulating since 2017, with Michael B Jordan then touted as a lead. Earlier this year, Lilly Wachowski gave any new iteration her blessing. \u201cI like it when stories go out into the world and then come back to you in different ways,\u201d she told Slash Film. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what storytelling is all about. I\u2019m part of a bigger thing. I don\u2019t have any ownership over stuff like that, so whatever story anybody wants to tell, I can\u2019t wait to hear. I hope it\u2019s better than the original.\u201d Since the original trilogy, the Wachowskis have had a number of commercial disappointments, including Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending. Their Netflix show Sense8 was cancelled after two seasons. This summer, Reeves scored a global hit, with John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum making more than $320m worldwide. He will next be seen in a long- awaited Bill &amp; Ted sequel. Sources tell Variety that the new Matrix film will start production in 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
