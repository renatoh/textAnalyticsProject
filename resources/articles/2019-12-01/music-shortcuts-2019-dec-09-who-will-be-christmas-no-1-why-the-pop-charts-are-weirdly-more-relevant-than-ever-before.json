Why the pop charts are weirdly more relevant than ever before", "bodyText": "When was the last time you really cared \u2013 or even knew \u2013 what was at No 1 in the UK singles chart? It is true that the era of No 1s sparking newspaper headlines (Blur and Oasis battling it out with Country House and Roll With It springs instantly to mind), of people genuinely being interested in who the guy from White Town was, or of thinking that Babylon Zoo\u2019s Spaceman would always be a timeless classic are long gone. It is now more than 13 years since Top of the Pops last broadcast its perky weekly update of chart goings-on to rapt homes and now, well, does anybody really care who\u2019s at No 1? At least two people do. For the past 10 weeks, the UK\u2019s most popular single has been a track called Dance Monkey, written and performed by a former busker from Australia called Tones and I. No less irritating than Spaceman, it is an EDM-lite party tune that gets played at parties you probably wouldn\u2019t want to be invited to. Yet its unwavering dominance is currently under threat from the YouTube star and dad blogger LadBaby with I Love Sausage Rolls, his own meaty take on Joan Jett\u2019s glamrock smash I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll and a fundraiser for the foodbank charity The Trussell Trust. If LadBaby\u2019s attempt at chart supremacy sounds unlikely, then the fact that he scored last year\u2019s Christmas No 1 with a similarly sausage roll-centric take on Starship\u2019s We Built This City (sweeping aside Ariana Grande and her very much inedible Thank U, Next) should be extremely telling. This development isn\u2019t just because people really, really love sausage rolls. Changes in the way the charts collect data means streaming stats and YouTube plays are now taken into consideration, so the charts are more representative of what people are listening to than ever before. As a result, songs such as Dance Monkey can organically climb up the charts as they did in the 70s. Smaller, unknown artists are in with a chance again, rather than being bulldozed by major label pop acts. It might seem as if No 1s don\u2019t matter any more, but to a younger generation the charts are more relevant than ever \u2013 whether they know it or not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
