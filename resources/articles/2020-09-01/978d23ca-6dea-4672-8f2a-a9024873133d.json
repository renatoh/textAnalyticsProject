With 27 kilometres remaining on the brutal 18th stage of the 2020 Tour de France, the Australian punctured on rough gravel roads. The 30 seconds it took for a team car to reach Porte felt like an eternity. By the time he had remounted a replacement bike, Porte was almost a minute behind his general classification competitors. Hopes of a podium finish in Paris seemed to ebb away. Once touted as the obvious successor to Cadel Evans, Porte\u2019s ambitions of winning the Tour de France yellow jersey have been consistently cruelled by misfortune and misadventure. In 2014 it was pneumonia; in 2016 a puncture and motorbike collision saw Porte lose vital time. In 2017 a horror crash left Porte in hospital; a year later, another race-ending crash. After two weeks of racing, 2020 was shaping up differently. While a wind-induced time loss on stage seven put Porte out of contention for the yellow jersey, the Australian was riding stronger every day \u2013 staying with leaders Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d and Tadej Poga\u010dar on even the toughest of climbs. The prospect of bettering his previous best overall finish, fifth in 2016, was within Porte\u2019s grasp. Then, he punctured. Another day, another Tour de France mishap for the Australian. Given his fraught history at the race, it would have been unsurprising had Porte\u2019s head dipped. Morale shot, the Trek rider might have rolled to the finish. But in a remarkable display of endurance, Porte battled back \u2013 effectively time trialling for almost 20 kilometres \u2013 to rejoin the group with just kilometres to go. He ultimately crossed the line in sixth place to retain his general classification position. \u201cTo get a puncture like that, of course it\u2019s going to happen to me,\u201d Porte said after the stage. \u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d On Sunday, the 107th edition of the Tour de France ended well for Porte. Having dodged that latest bout of misfortune on Thursday, the race\u2019s final three stages proved smooth-sailing. A remarkable performance in the actual time trial on Saturday, where Porte finished third, saw him leap over Miguel \u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez in the overall standings to earn a spot on the podium. His third-place finish is the best general classification result by any Australian at the Tour, bar Evans (who won in 2011 and finished second twice). Porte\u2019s podium is therefore a historic result for Australian cycling. It may lack the glamour of Caleb Ewan\u2019s recent stage wins, or Michael Matthews\u2019 green jersey triumph in 2017. Yet pitted against a field of the best climbers in the world, Porte held his own. In the 100 plus years since Australians first began contesting this grandest of grand tours, only Porte and Evans have managed such a feat. Aged 35, this has been Porte\u2019s final shot at Tour glory. He is off-contract at the end of this year and is expected to move to a new team as a super-domestique, reverting to the role of deputy he previously performed so admirably for Tour winners Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome. Asked earlier this month whether 2020 is his last hurrah as a team leader, Porte was emphatic: \u201c100%\u201d. Porte\u2019s third ends his leadership career on a relative high. Beyond the grand tours, he has a glittering palmar\u00e8s: two Paris-Nice victories, successes at Volta a Catalunya, Tour de Romandie and Tour de Suisse and a national time trial title. Such has been Porte\u2019s dominance at the Tour Down Under that the Willunga Hill stage is now synonymous with the rider \u2013 before 2020, when he was dethroned, Porte had won the stage on six consecutive occasions. Yet Porte\u2019s broader legacy will largely rest on what could have been. Ever since the short-statured Launceston local rocketed up the infamous Gunns Plains climb during the 2008 Tour of Tasmania, Australian cycling fans have salivated about his full potential. Every subsequent year, domestic cycling news has been full of speculation about Porte\u2019s form and ambitions for the season ahead. Following Evans\u2019 retirement, the weight of the cycling establishment\u2019s expectations has rested squarely on Porte\u2019s shoulders. He certainly had the talent to win a Tour de France crown. There are three essential attributes to claiming yellow: climbing, time trialing and team support. Porte can climb with the best mountain goats; for a time, he was one of the world\u2019s fastest individual time trailers; and during his stints at Team Sky and BMC Racing Team, Porte had strong domestiques in spades. But he never had that fourth, more intangible quality: good fortune. This coming Sunday, Porte will line up in Australian colours for the UCI Road World Championships road race. Backed by a strong team, on a hilly Italian course, he is an outside chance \u2013 although the terrain may be more favourable to puncheur-style riders like compatriot Matthews. Farewelling his leadership ambitions with the rainbow jersey would be a fairytale ending for Porte, in a career that has until now been characterised by an absence of positive conclusions. In any event, his podium finish in Paris is just-rewards for an impressive career that makes Porte one of Australia\u2019s best ever cyclists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
