From a site in the lower part of the Montagne Noire in the Languedoc, this has all of those attributes, and with just the right level of acidity to keep it perky it has to be one of the best-value white wines around at the moment. Rustenberg Sauvignon Blanc, Western Cape, South Africa 2010 (\u00a312.49, or \u00a39.99 when you buy any two bottles of South African wine, Majestic) Most Sauvignon Blanc slips down with barely a second thought, like an alcohol-spiked gooseberry-and-elderflower cordial, but this serious South African white from the consistently good Rustenberg has a bit more to it. It has weight and depth as well as those characteristically green flavours, plus a squeeze of juicy passion fruit. Clonakilla Hilltops Shiraz, Canberra District, Australia 2010 (\u00a317.75, hailsham cellars.com; \u00a317.85, slurp.co.uk) There's a dash of Viognier (1% to be precise) in this classic Aussie Shiraz, a practice borrowed from C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie in France's northern Rh\u00f4ne and which here seems to give some extra aromatic lift to what is a fabulously pure black-fruited beauty. Dense and powerful but vivid and full of life, it is a joy to drink now or several years down the line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
