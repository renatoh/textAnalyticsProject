Scary rides really do scare me. Even nine-year-old Storme doesn't particularly enjoy being overly afraid. So there's really only one theme park I know of in Britain which is wimpish enough - Legoland (legoland.co.uk). We've been three times in the last year; on our last trip, I learnt, with approval, that Lego has been voted Toy of the Century by the British Association Of Toy Retailers, beating Barbie, thankfully. I thought we'd have to wait until Easter for our next trip, as Legoland closes for the winter. But - hooray! - it opens especially for the Christmas school holidays as well. I always go on the Fairy Tale Brook boat ride first; it's my favourite. But there's the Dragon Coaster for the more robust family members. And the Adventurers' Wave Surfer, and Jack Stone Stunt Show... so Storme's 12-year-old friend Iona couldn't complain. We don't have a dog (thank God, three kids plus friends is enough), but even they are catered for. There's a kennel at the gate where Rovers, Fidos and Spots are minded. Pity there isn't a similar system for whiny children... We're lucky; we can reach Legoland within an hour. But although Berkshire is an unlikely short-break destination, the Millennium Madjeski hotel in Reading does Legoland weekends (millennium-hotels.com); and you can always take in Windsor Castle on the way home. I know Legoland has a short shelf life; it's designed for the younger end of the theme park market, with 12 its top age. Storme may soon consider just looking at Miniland's London Eye in Lego bricks too tame, and want to move on to more monstrous entertainment. But that doesn't bother me, as I'll still have the twins, just 20 months, as a good excuse to board Fairy Tale Brook. \u00b7 Please send tips for sharing to travelwithkids@aol.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
