The money has been divided between three two-year projects exploring the UK's preparedness for and response to terrorist attacks and their aftermath. Each will draw on expertise from UK universities and abroad. Paul Wilkinson, professor of international relations and director of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence at the University of St Andrews, heads up a \u00a3250,000 project investigating the UK's management of terrorist attacks, joined by experts in terrorism and political violence from the University of Southampton. \"Our aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of UK response to both the threat and the actuality of terrorist attack,\" said Professor Wilkinson. \"But we will provide this through detailed study of the experience of the UK in managing terrorist attacks before and after September 11.\" Professor Wilkinson, who has researched terrorism for the past 30 years, has written consistently about the weaknesses in US aviation security since the 1980s. \"But even in my worst nightmares I had not really realised this ultimate airline hijack and the scale of loss of life as on September 11.\" He said although there was a shortage of academics specialising in this field, more independent research was needed. \"It's too important to be left to governments, or to officials and security agencies to work this out.\" A second research team will be led by Lawrence Freedman, professor of war studies at King's College, London. Its investigations will include the role of communication in managing terrorist attacks. The team involved in the \u00a3200,000 project will be drawn from De Montfort University's department of public policy, Leeds University's institute of communication studies and the University of Kent's school of social policy, sociology and social research. \"Given that the objective of terrorism is to underscore people's vulnerabilities and anxieties, then communication around the event is clearly very important,\" said the professor. \"Plenty of examples exist of government appearing to lose control, and when communication goes wrong this can drive public concerns rather than assuage them.\" The research will build on King's College's current investigations into European counter-terrorism, funded by a $150,000 MacArthur Foundation award. The third project, led by Michael Dillon, professor of politics at the University of Lancaster, will explore the vulnerabilities of our global society, and how they could make it open to terrorist attacks. Professor Dillon believes the strengths of a globally-networked society may also be the source of its weakness. The ease and frequency in which society uses air travel was, he argued, exploited by the al-Qaida network. \"Much terrorist-related research focuses on the composition and operation characteristics of terrorist networks with a view to providing policy and intelligence advice about those who pose terrorist threats,\" said Professor Dillon. \"This project will provide a contrast to that approach by focusing on the other side of the equation. Specifically, we will examine the civil vulnerabilities of UK society and, in particular, our vulnerabilities as a globally-networked knowledge-intensive society.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
