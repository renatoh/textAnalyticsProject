This week's debate on voting rights for prisoners left me wondering who, on that criteria, would be eligible for government grants? It was not the security of the realm that was at stake \u2013 although you would hardly have known this from the tenor of some of the parliamentary and media debates. It was whether everyone sentenced to prison, regardless of how long or what for, should automatically lose their citizenship rights along with their liberty. Does a single mother banged up for shoplifting cease to be entitled to any rights at all? As we are witnessing daily, people all over the world consider the right to vote as fundamental to their humanity. Ending our virtual blanket ban on all convicted prisoners voting would do no more than bring the UK into line with Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and most other European countries. Not overturning it leaves us in the company of Armenia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary and Romania. That being said, voting rights for convicts is an issue that people of goodwill are always going to disagree on. The deeper question is what the wider reaction to the 2005 European court of human rights ruling suggests about our respect, as a country, for the universal rights our prime minister rightly lauds. What makes that phrase more than a hollow incantation is a mechanism to require states to adhere to the standards they have signed up to. Some MPs who spoke in Thursday's debate seemed barely aware that it is nearly 60 years since we ratified the UK-inspired European convention on human rights. No judges can please all the people all of the time but, as Labour MP Kate Green said: \"How can we expect other countries not to pick and choose if we start to do so ourselves?\" Some of the measures in today's protection of freedoms bill, such as ending stop and search without suspicion or overturning the retention of innocent people's DNA, flow from decisions of the human rights court. Britain's sovereign parliament and common law completely failed to regulate the security services until this was declared a breach of the convention. The law which led to the News of the World privacy prosecutions was introduced as a result of the Human Rights Act. Whatever the outcome on the voting rights issue, the diplomatic \u2013 let alone legal \u2013 implications mean there is no realistic prospect the UK will withdraw from the European convention in the foreseeable future. Attorney general Dominic Grieve affirmed in the debate that \"we will honour those international obligations\", for to do otherwise would \"diminish our own status, in terms of our respect for international law as much as domestic law\". What is on the cards, the prime minister confirmed in December, is \"replacing\" the Human Rights Act with a \"British bill of rights\". MPs argued this week that this would \"free\" us from Strasbourg rulings. In fact it would make no difference to such obligations. The act does exactly what many protagonists claim to support. It gives UK courts jurisdiction over European convention rights without having to follow Strasbourg case law and without the power to overturn acts of parliament. Of course it is possible to have a bill of rights that is bigger and better than the HRA. But if the sole purpose of its replacement, as Cameron says, is that rights \"should be written down here in this country\", what does that say about our adherence to universal human rights?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
