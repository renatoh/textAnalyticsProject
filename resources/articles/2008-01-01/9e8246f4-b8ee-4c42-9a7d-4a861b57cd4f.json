Mandarins/tangerines: collective terms for small oranges, though tangerine can refer to a specific variety. Clementines: perhaps the best little oranges of all - tight-skinned and glossy, their juice is particularly sweet and fragrant. Usually seedless. Satsumas: loose-skinned fruit, easy to peel, but lack a clementine's subtlety. Seville oranges: aka bitter oranges. Appear mid-January and are gone by mid-February. Freeze well, so you can put off the marmalade-making. Blood oranges: very sweet and with vermilion flesh; a great alternative to conventional oranges in most recipes. In season from December to March. Navel oranges: get their name from the bellybutton-like form at the base. A successful commercial type because they are sweet and juicy, have no seeds and are easy to peel. Juicing oranges: soft-fleshed and juicy varieties with few or no seeds. \u00b7 If you're buying citrus from a developing country, look for a fair trade option - fairtrade.org.uk has a list of fairly-traded citrus fruit available from supermarkets. \u00b7 Like most citrus fruit, oranges are often coated in wax to help prolong their life and improve appearance. The wax may be based on polyethylene, beeswax or shellac (derived from the excretions of an insect). Unlike lemons, there's little labelling, so if you're buying conventional fruit, assume it's waxed. Most waxes are soluble and can be removed with a scrub in warm water. To avoid wax, go organic, as waxing is not permitted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
