With broadcasters and politicians addressing the nation from their own front rooms, it has become easier than ever. Now we don\u2019t even have to go to someone\u2019s home (fortunate in these times) to judge them by their reading habits. Now the libraries of the famous are laid bare for us all to mock or admire. What does it tell us about Boris Johnson, for example, that he has a collection of big, gold-lettered, red-spined hardbacks that look as if they\u2019ve come straight from the fabled library of Alexandria? Or that Prince Charles keeps a hefty Dick Francis close at hand? MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt and the Washington Post\u2019s White House reporter Seung Min Kim both arrange their books by colour, it seems. Joe Wicks has beautiful shelves with \u2026 no books on them. And a screenshot of the \u201cfirst ever digital cabinet\u201d, shared by the PM, suggests that Jacob Rees-Mogg has one of those dream libraries with dark wood shelves and ladders on wheels. Of course, broadcasters know that bookshelves say a lot about a person, and some have been cheating. Fox News correspondent Brandi Kruse, for example, tweeted: \u201cReporters, experts, pundits working from home in front of bookshelves: what is ONE book you removed from your shelf because you didn\u2019t want people to see it. Don\u2019t lie you, know you did. Mine: 365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy (no memory of how it came to be in my possession).\u201d Cynical viewers will obviously allege that some people have deliberately scratched together a pile of books to pose against, while book lovers assume it would be impossible to find a camera angle in any reasonable person\u2019s home that doesn\u2019t reveal a healthy lockdown reading pile. Here are some of the most interesting bookshelves in the homes of the commentariat. But are they intellectual poseurs or lifelong readers? Jon Snow The Channel 4 news anchor set the tone for broadcasting from home with his smart grey suits and well-stocked bookshelves. Snow\u2019s bottom shelf is clearly the art section, with books about Andy Warhol, Aubrey Beardsley, Aristide Maillol, Br\u00e2ncu\u015fi, Caravaggio and Utagawa Kuniyoshi. There\u2019s an eclectic music shelf, including Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley by Timothy White and Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s memoir The Last Holiday. But Snow is also perhaps following advice to keep healthy and exercise the brain, with Treasures of British History \u2013 by his cousin Peter and his son Dan Snow \u2013 and The Clever Guts Diet Recipe Book by Dr Clare Bailey. Dominic Raab The foreign secretary, on the other hand, appears to have hastily assembled a book collection shortly before appearing on BBC News. Standing in front of a windowsill, he posed with a pile of brand-new-looking books on either side of his head. They included biographies of Richard Nixon and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a book about economics from the Economist, and Niall Ferguson\u2019s Virtual History, which asks questions such as: \u201cWhat if Britain had stayed out of the first world war? What if Germany had won the second?\u201d What if Raab had already read that book on economics before we got into this mess, we all wondered. Kate Middleton \u201cKate Middleton shows off her incredible book collection in rare picture taken inside her Kensington Palace home,\u201d promised Hello! magazine in a headline guaranteed to excite nosy book lovers. Alas, the photos showed the Duchess of Cambridge with a row of elegant clothbound Penguin Classics that are beautiful, if not as special as \u201cincredible\u201d might suggest. The Duchess is said to enjoy contemporary thrillers such as The Girl on the Train, but this collection is much more canonical. It includes Sense and Sensibility and Mansfield Park by Jane Austen, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde and Middlemarch by George Eliot. Nicola Sturgeon A lockdown is always a good time for a conspiracy theory, and Sturgeon\u2019s bookshelves inspired a great one. The Scottish first minister is known to be a book lover, and her collection shows that she is a loyal supporter of Scottish writers. But why, some asked, were her shelves almost entirely full of Ian Rankins in one interview, and then packed with Val McDermids in another on the same day? Was it something Rankin had said about independence that prompted a cull? Probably not; a closer look shows that Sturgeon had just shuffled her chair one bookcase along. Rishi Sunak Dishy Rishi can\u2019t seem to put a foot wrong at the moment, starting with his \u201ckiss of life\u201d budget and climaxing with this working-from-home photo. His housebound admirers swooned over his cosy hoodie, his two screens and his excellent bookshelves. The chancellor scores points for authenticity \u2013 this is no last-minute book grab to look clever, but the study of our dreams, including a row of Penguin Popular Classics, which were phased out in 2013. Perhaps he could lend some to his colleague Raab?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
