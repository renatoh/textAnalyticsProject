Oddly there are few records of bridge construction to help historians, but their existence is revealed by reports of damage or destruction caused by bad weather. So an account written in 1406 of winter \"floods and rains of exceptional severity\" is particularly helpful. It reports: \"The swollen Severn had well nigh wrecked the bridges of Montford and Bridgenorth. At York the Fossbridge was in ruins and the Ouse bridge weakened. The bridge over the Wharfe at Tadcaster was damaged and the causeway hence to Boroughbridge destroyed. So also were the bridges over the Eamont and the Lowther on the northwestern road passing by Penrith to Carlisle. The bridge over the Nene at Thrapston was broken, and that over the Wensum at Attlebridge could no longer bear the great traffic passing to and from the worsted seld at Norwich. \"In the fen country from Holland bridge to Donnington, roads bridges and causeways were wrecked and washed away. The sheriffs posted their outriders requested immediate contributions from abbots, priors, and landowners, and indulgences were freely offered by the Bishops to all who helped in making good the damage.\" Along the Thames, bridges were reported to be still \"in danger\" at Wallingford, Staines, Windsor, Weybridge, Kingston and Maidenhead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
