However, there is already a Giving Tuesday (3 December this year), which was launched \u2013 like Black Friday \u2013 in the US and is overseen by the Charities Aid Foundation in this country. It has been running for six years in the UK. Peter Collins London \u2022 My wife, who has on occasion accused me of being a pedant, was much amused by the coining by Ian Broadbridge (Letters, 2 December) of the valuable new word \u201cpedee\u201d. However, she then listened politely while I gave the necessary lengthy explanation that under the currently accepted structure of our language, it is she, and not I, who can be accurately thus described.

This is based on the erroneous belief that \u201cmentor\u201d is one who \u201cments\u201d, whereas it derives from the personal name of Mentor, the adviser of Telemachus, the son of Odysseus. Robert Cairns Perth \u2022 Re \u201cBad sex award judges unable to separate joint recipients\u201d (3 December), we used to find a bucket of cold water worked well on dogs.

Ian Grieve Gordon Bennett, Llangollen canal \u2022 Has anyone noticed that \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d is an anagram of \u201cBeing Extorted\u201d (Letters, 30 November?)
