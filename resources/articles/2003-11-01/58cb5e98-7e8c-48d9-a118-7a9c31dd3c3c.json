Bryan Sanderson, Sunderland's plc chairman, blamed relegation from the Premiership for most of the loss and said: \"The management of the team and of the acquisitions in the transfer market was unacceptable.\" \"We are all extremely determined to bring about recovery and revival and to give our stakeholders a club to once again be proud of.\" Sanderson admitted Sunderland's drop into the First Division was \"not a surprise\" at the end of a season which saw them sack first Peter Reid and then Howard Wilkinson as managers. The chairman described the performance on the pitch all season as \"thoroughly inadequate\". Relegation \"was a major blow for our shareholders and supporters, and my first task is to apologise to them for a failure to deliver the prime objective of any football club - success on the field of play and has cost your company dearly,\" he added. \"In particular a large part of the \u00a318m squad purchases to try and save our Premiership status added little or no value.\" That \u00a318m went on players such as Tore Andre Flo, Marcus Stewart, Stephen Wright and Matt Piper, as well as handing lucrative contracts to free transfer acquisitions like Phil Babb and Thomas Myhre. Peter Reid, the man who spent that money, departed last October when Wilkinson was asked to steady the ship, but his services were dispensed with in March after only 27 games at the helm. It has been left to Mick McCarthy, their third manager last season, to pick up the pieces. Even so, Sanderson remained optimistic about Sunderland's future, saying: \"We now believe we have the financial support, playing management and at the very least the nucleus of the squad needed to return quickly to Premiership football. We have far more upside than downside potential.\" Sunderland have shed 70 non-playing staff and halved a players' wage bill of \u00a334m. No fewer than 23 players have departed, including Flo, Kevin Phillips, Thomas Sorensen, Gavin McCann and Claudio Reyna. Players and officials have also accepted a 12-month deferral on part of their salaries until next August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
