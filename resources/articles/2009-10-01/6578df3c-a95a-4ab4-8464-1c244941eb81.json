Why it took so long is a puzzle, since Warren's talents are extraordinary. She has an octave-hopping voice that glides between languid and urgent, and music that hovers between funk, folk and jazz, between Jeff Buckley and Nina Simone. Songs like \"Year End Issue\" and \"Sunday Comfort\" are edgy, romantic sketches from urban life, given classy, understated accompaniments here, though Warren's solo performances with acoustic guitar are more stunning. Either way, she's the real deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
