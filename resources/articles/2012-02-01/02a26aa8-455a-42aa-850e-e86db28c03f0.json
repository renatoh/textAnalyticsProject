Chris Hughton, 2012", "bodyText": "Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) Not clever. Send all five of them off, and abandon the match as the team now have fewer than seven players. Then submit a detailed report, including your view that it looked pre-planned: the authorities have the option of recording the final score as 4-0. There is no rule that if a team causes an abandonment then they forfeit the game 3-0. So the result is likely to be relegation, fines and suspensions all round. Simon Wright wins the shirt. 2) Provided the comment has not been overheard by others who may be offended, manage the situation with a strong rebuke. Let them know that if you hear a repeat, they will be reported to the authorities. But if the comment was loud enough to be heard by others, send off the player who made it. It would then be up to him to appeal, with his team-mate supporting him at the hearing. Thanks to Luke Surl. 3) Send off the defender for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity. Restart with a direct free-kick if the attacker was hit outside the area, or a penalty if he was inside. Thanks to Stephen Glennon.
