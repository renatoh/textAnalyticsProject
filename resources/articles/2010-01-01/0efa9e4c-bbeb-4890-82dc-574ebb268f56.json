While an upbeat Spotify was boasting of 250,000 paying subscribers and huge advertising revenues, its rival, MusicStation, was kickstarting a streaming war by announcing it will now come preloaded on to millions of HP computers. Meanwhile, Bach Technology launched MusicDNA, the latest contender to succeed MP3s as the digital format of choice: not by making music sound any better, but by coming complete with lyrics, Twitter feeds and those all-important new revenue opportunities. Elsewhere, 15 new(ish) music websites were chosen to pitch their digital wares to Midem's assembled masses. One of the most enjoyable is GoMix.com, which enables anyone to remix tracks by big-name artists. GoMix is actually the new name for U-Myx, which launched in 2004 and did a similar thing, albeit in a less sophisticated way. Some 125,000 amateur remixers are active on the updated site, tinkering with songs by artists including Sugababes, Bat for Lashes and Pet Shop Boys. The hope is to eventually charge users to download their mix \u2013 and with the average remixer apparently spending 16 minutes rejigging a song, you would imagine a fair number will part with \u00a31 to own their masterpiece. Also pitching at Midem was thesixtyone.com, a burgeoning music discovery site. Its spokesperson revealed that the average user spends around 15 hours per week listening to music on the site. Unfortunately, even as they spoke, those same users were revolting against thesixtyone, following a major redesign that went live last week. To a first-time visitor, the new site looks great and works well, with a surprisingly high standard of new, independent music easily available. But, as you'll gather from the outpouring of fury at facebook.com/thesixtyone, its most dedicated users are apoplectic about lost functionality, particularly the disappearance of community aspects. Web users often react badly to change, but it's remarkable to see so many responding so strongly. Alienating dedicated users in the attempt to gain new ones is an enormous gamble. Over at caughtbytheriver.net, things are altogether calmer. The terrific angling-cum-music site has just launched a new compilation series featuring \"songs that are either by, about or influenced by birds\". The first Birdsongs mix, put together by British Sea Power's Martin Noble, soars and swoops from the Jackson Five's Rockin' Robin to Charlie Parker's Ornithology to the Happy Mondays' Rats With Wings. Sign up to the site's mailing list before Sunday and you'll be sent a link to download the excellent free compilation.
