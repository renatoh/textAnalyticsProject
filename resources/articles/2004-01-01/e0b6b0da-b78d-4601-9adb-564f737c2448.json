It is believed that at least one other bidder - the Daily Mail and General Trust - was also in negotiation and believed it was having talks in \"good faith\" with the official Hollinger bank, Lazard. Hollinger put its assets - which also include the Chicago Sun-Times and the Jerusalem Post - officially on sale on Friday and a number of groups had been in talks over the last two months when Conrad Black was first forced to resign as chief executive. One source said Andrew Neil, who works as the Barclay brothers' publisher, had been talking about putting a bid together himself with venture capitalists because the Barclay brothers were not enthusiastic about a bid. The source says this was the case \"three weeks ago\" fuelling speculation that Lord Black is rushing through the deal. Andrew Neil could not be contacted today for confirmation. The Barclays have written to the Hollinger board pledging to work with them and not to interfere with the strategic review being overseen by investment bank Lazard. But it may prove difficult for Lazard to keep bidders interested now that there has been a change of control at Hollinger Inc, which owns 73% of the voting rights at Hollinger International. A number of potential bidders have expressed their interest in Hollinger, including Express boss Richard Desmond and the Daily Mail and General Trust. Both parties are anxiously awaiting the outcome of decisions made in New York by the Hollinger board and US financial watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission. Questions have already been raised about the Barclays' deal, partly because they will be taking on unknown liabilities at Hollinger Inc, which has been hit with a lawsuit from Hollinger International and is being investigated by the SEC. Filing a federal court order against Hollinger International on Friday, the SEC underlined its support for a special committee investigation that is aiming to protect the interests of minority shareholders and preserve the company's assets. Given that Lord Black had undertaken not to sell Hollinger Inc if it affected potential disposals at Hollinger International, the newspaper owner may believe it could mount a legal challenge to yesterday's deal. After the Barclays and Lord Black unveiled their deal, Hollinger International put out a cautious statement which said it intended \"to review the offer for Hollinger Inc and its implications for Hollinger International\". Shares in Hollinger Inc soared 87% in early trade today in Canada - the Barclays' offer was made at a premium of more than 100% to Friday's closing price. The Barclays announced yesterday they had agreed with Lord Black to buy his controlling stake stake in Hollinger Inc and were making an offer to the remaining shareholders that would value the company at \u00a3260m. Sources close to the reclusive twins say they are confident they should be able to avoid regulatory difficulties either side of the Atlantic. New media regulator Ofcom is likely to look at any deal to acquire the Telegraph group, to assess any public interest or competition concerns. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
