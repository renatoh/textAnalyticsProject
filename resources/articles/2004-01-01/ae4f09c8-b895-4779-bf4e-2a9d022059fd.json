As appeals were made for a fresh inquiry into the murder of French film-maker Sophie Toscan du Plantier in County Cork, 46-year-old Bailey now faces a huge legal bill and financial ruin. The Manchester-born reporter brought cases against eight British and Irish newspapers in a bid to clear his name. Bailey was the prime suspect for the murder of Ms du Plantier, 38, found bludgeoned to death in a lane by her Schull farmhouse on December 23, 1996. He was the first journalist on the scene and reported the story for several Irish and French publications. Just weeks after the murder he was arrested and questioned twice by gardai, but released without charge. The murder remains unsolved. In a judgment following last month's 10-day hearing at Cork circuit court, Judge Patrick Moran awarded Bailey just \u00a35,600 damages for articles in the Irish Sun and the Irish Mirror which claimed he had beaten his ex-wife. But he said he would have no hesitation in describing Bailey as a violent man, adding that it was \"exceptional\" to come across an incident where a man had beaten his partner twice, let alone three times. \"What came across was that Jules Thomas [Bailey's current partner] had suffered three nasty assaults at the hands of Mr Bailey,\" he said. \"In one he was brought before the district court and received a suspended sentence. But he said he was violent towards one woman and that's it.\" He also described Bailey as a man who clearly enjoyed courting publicity. \"One can assume that Mr Bailey was a man who likes a certain amount of notoriety, likes to be in the limelight and likes a bit of self-publicity,\" he said. Judge Moran outlined a number of inconsistencies in Bailey's case and said he accepted the evidence of a number of witnesses who claimed Bailey had admitted to them that he had killed Ms du Plantier. These included Malachi Reed, then aged 14, who said Bailey had confessed to him that that he had \"bashed her fucking brains in\" and locals Rosie and Ritchie Shelley, who claimed he had told them on New Year's Eve 1998 that he had committed the murder. \"I accept that he did say that,\" said Judge Moran. \"I think it was a case of further self publicity and was probably drink-induced.\" He also accepted the evidence of local shopkeeper Marie Farrell, who said she thought she had seen Bailey a mile from Ms du Plantier's house in the early hours of the morning after her murder. Although Bailey insisted he had never met Ms du Plantier, one witness, neighbour Alfie Lyons, said he was 80% or 90% certain he had introduced the pair, which the judge took to be true. Judge Moran also accepted that Bailey had been seen burning a fire on Boxing Day, three days after the murder, although he added that what was being burnt was \"anyone's guess\". During the December hearing Bailey claimed his life had been destroyed by the \"monstrous defamations\" in the press, alleging that offers of work had dried up and that he had been ostracised by his local community. But the Irish Star, the Sunday Independent, the Independent on Sunday, the Times, the Sunday Times and the Daily Telegraph were all cleared of libelling the journalist. \"The plaintiff says that the papers portrayed Mr Bailey as being a murderer,\" said the judge, concluding the 35-minute judgment. \"I have read the articles several times but these articles do not convey to me that he was the murderer. What they do convey is that he was the suspect and that he was arrested on suspicion of murder. \"They constantly quote what Mr Bailey said - that he didn't do it.\" Judge Moran then outlined the two exceptions regarding the relationship between Bailey and his ex-wife Sarah Limbrick, also a journalist. The pair married in Gloucester in 1980 when Bailey was 23, but split five years later. The Irish Mirror and the Irish Sun were ordered to pay \u00a32,800 each. Both newspapers said they were now considering their position with a view to appealing against the judgment. Solicitor Karyn Woods, acting for both newspapers, said she was pleased that on the whole the two articles were accurate. \"It was only one minor aspect which he has found against us,\" she said, expressing disappointment that having already branded Bailey a violent man, the judge awarded damages to him for that particular detail. Bailey had sued each newspaper for maximum circuit court damages of \u00a326,000. The ruling on legal costs, which could reach \u00a3420,000 has been delayed until February 12. The Irish Labour Party later called for the murder investigation to be re-activated. Justice spokesman Joe Costello said gardai must now use the new evidence from Bailey's libel hearing to their advantage. \"Given the renewed focus on the circumstances surrounding Ms du Plantier's murder following the trial, there are clearly grounds to return to the case,\" he said. \"Every effort must be made to find out who was responsible and bring them to justice.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
