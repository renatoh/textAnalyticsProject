Gloucester instituted a round of cost-cutting measures last season that saw the administrative and coaching staffs reduced while players were asked to take 15% wage cuts, which they refused, though some of the biggest earners, such as the fly-half Ludovic Mercier, were off-loaded at the end of the campaign. \"Making the cuts was a tough time for all concerned, but the fact that we will record a profit of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000 when the books are audited means we can look to the future with confidence,\" said the Gloucester managing director Ken Nottage. Gloucester will announce new shirt sponsors later this month and talk of a consortium taking over from the club's chairman Tom Walkinshaw has faded. \"Tom remains fully hands-on and is helping draw up our strategic plan for next season,\" said Nottage. Gloucester's west country rivals Bath yesterday appointed John Connolly, formerly of Queensland, Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Swansea, as their head coach in succession to Michael Foley, who will take charge of the forwards. Bath first approached Connolly 15 months ago but he had already agreed to join Swansea, where he lasted seven months before the club went into voluntary administration. Bath have signed 10 players this summer but Connolly says there is a need for three more new faces. The former New Zealand centre Paul Steinmetz is one of his targets. Leicester have appointed the former All Black flanker Josh Kronfeld, who has signed a new one-year contract, as their captain for the World Cup campaign in Martin Johnson's absence, the first overseas player to be given the honour since the New Zealander Colin Martin 40 years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
