Maybe even towards the end of 2021,\u201d he warned in an interview with MSNBC. And in an apparent rebuke to Donald Trump\u2019s claim this week that the US is \u201crounding the corner\u201d on Covid-19, Fauci said that current data on the pandemic is, in fact, \u201cdisturbing\u201d. Fauci was asked in the interview on Friday about the president\u2019s most recent comments on the virus, in which he also said: \u201cWe\u2019re rounding the final turn, and a lot of good things are happening.\u201d Fauci said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have to disagree with that, because if you look at the thing that you just mentioned, the statistics, Andrea, they\u2019re disturbing. We\u2019re plateauing at around 40,000 [new] cases a day and the deaths are around 1,000.\u201d Fauci was speaking with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell a day after the president told a White House press briefing: \u201cI really do believe we\u2019re rounding the corner.\u201d Trump\u2019s comment came two days after recordings of the president showed he had knowingly played down the threat of the virus in early February to prevent what he called \u201cpanic\u201d, while admitting to journalist Bob Woodward at the time in interviews for a forthcoming book that he knew Covid-19 was \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d and worse than bad influenza. Asked to evaluate Trump\u2019s minimization, Fauci said: \u201cWhen you downplay something, that\u2019s really a threat and not a good thing.\u201d The US has a world record 6.3m cases of Covid-19 and almost 200,000 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins data. While daily new cases in the US have halved since late July, when rates peaked at around 70,000 new casesa day, Fauci reiterated his concern that the approach of fall and winter \u2013 when people will spend more time indoors \u2013 could push the US into a \u201cprecarious situation\u201d. \u201cWhen you have a baseline of infections that are 40,000 per day and you have threats of increased test positivity in certain regions of the country, such as the Dakotas and Montana and places like that \u2026 You don\u2019t want to start off already with a baseline that\u2019s so high,\u201d he said. Fauci\u2019s comments come a day after reports indicated that a Trump administration appointee at the Department of Health and Human Services had tried to encourage officials at the National Institutes of Health, where Fauci works, to steer the expert on his public comments. On Thursday Fauci said: \u201cWe need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d On the infection rate, he said: \u201cI keep looking at that curve and I get more depressed and more depressed about the fact that we never really get down to the baseline that I\u2019d like,\u201d he said. Fauci told MSNBC he was confident that the vaccine approval process is going to be done correctly. Meanwhile, Holden Thorpe, the editor-in-chief of Science, the top US scientific journal, wrote on Friday that Trump \u201cdeliberately lied about science in a way that \u2026 directly led to widespread deaths of Americans\u201d, adding that \u201cthis may be the most shameful moment in the history of US science policy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
