The national police force said the investigation began after a tip-off to its people-trafficking hotline. When officers went to the house on the Costa del Sol they found it was being run as a 24-hour brothel with a bar. They freed the eight women and arrested 21 alleged members of a gang led by a Portuguese family. \u201cThe investigation found that the women were recruited in Spain,\u201d the force said. \u201cSome of them voluntarily sought work at the brothel while others were tricked with offers of work in a \u2018massage parlour\u2019. Once there they were subjected to a system of fines, exhausting days and threats.\u201d Police also discovered that the women were forbidden to leave the basement, and that the gang supplied cocaine and MDMA to its customers. \u201cFifty-five grams of MDMA were recovered, along with 5g cocaine, 17 small bags of hashish, 190g of Kamagra, \u20ac1,000 in cash, four fake \u20ac100 notes, a large number of knives, computers, mobile phones and documents suggesting criminal activity,\u201d the force said. It said the operation was part of its wider efforts to tackle human trafficking and sexual exploitation. As well as the hotline, it has an email address where people can report crimes anonymously. So far this year it has received more than 700 reports by phone and email. Spain, which effectively decriminalised prostitution in 1995, is trying to crack down on trafficking and exploitation. Recent estimates put revenue from Spain\u2019s domestic sex trade at $26.5bn a year, from an estimated workforce of 300,000 people and hundreds of licensed brothels. The country\u2019s caretaker socialist government has promised to outlaw prostitution, which it calls \u201cone of the cruellest aspects of the feminisation of poverty and one of the worst forms of violence against women\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
