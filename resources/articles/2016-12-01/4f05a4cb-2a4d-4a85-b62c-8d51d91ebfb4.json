It had been widely reported that a member of the public had seen him get out of the driver\u2019s cab and had chased him through Berlin\u2019s streets into the central park, the Tiergarten, keeping in contact with police all the time and enabling his arrest at the Victory Column. However, it has since emerged that the witness saw the man get out of the truck, followed him briefly and then lost sight of him. On the basis of a rudimentary description the witness gave to the police, Naved B. was arrested at the Victory Column shortly afterwards. Police have since released him on the grounds they found no evidence against him, and say he is no longer a suspect. He has admitted to police he was at the Christmas market as a bystander, but then ran away out of fear he might be considered a suspect. But he had no traces of blood or gunshot residue on his clothing and blood smeared clothes and blood found in the cab did not match his blood type, police said. Police did have some further information about the path the driver of the Scania truck took before driving it through the Christmas market. Police say he drove around the Christmas market once probably in order to survey the best place from which to access it, before driving the truck at around 40 to 50 mph into the crowd. US officials do not have enough information to confirm the claim by Isis that the group is responsible for the Berlin Christmas market attack, said State Department spokesman John Kirby. Kirby said \u201cthere is no direct evidence of a tie or a link to a terrorist organization, but this bears the hallmarks of previous terror attacks.\u201d A manhunt is still underway for the driver of the truck which rammed into crowds at the Breitscheidplatz Christmas market, killing 12 and injuring 48. Of those killed, six were German, one was Polish (the original truck driver, Lukasz Urban, a 37-year-old who was found dead in the passenger seat of the vehicle). The identities of the other victims are not yet known. Isis claimed responsibility for the attack through its news agency Amaq, calling the assailant responsible a \u201csoldier\u201d who \u201ccarried out the attack in response to calls to target citizens of the international coalition\u201d. However, Isis provided no evidence to support its claim. Police released Naved B, a Pakistani asylum seeker who they had arrested on Monday night, after finding no evidence that he was the driver of the truck. A bystander had tried to follow the driver of the truck for more than a mile after they witnessed him jump out before it was driven into the Christmas market, but it seems they misidentified the suspect. \u201cWe do not want to live paralysed by the fear of evil,\u201d said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, before visiting Breitscheidplatz. The attacks - and arrest of an asylum seeker - sparked political debate in Germany over immigration and the policies of Merkel, who is facing re-election next year. The New York Times architecture critic Michael Kimmelman writes about Breitscheidplatz, the square and Christmas market he frequented when he lived nearby: Who knows yet whether the terrorist behind the attack knew much about the site, but before the war it was the beating heart of western Berlin, a bustling hub bedazzled by bright movie theater marquees and flashing neon signs, thronged by cabaretgoers, echoing, night and day, with the chatter of revelers and the sounds of honking buses and streetcar bells. After the war, it remained a commercial center for the divided city, the West\u2019s version, more or less, of Herald Square or Piccadilly Circus. By then, West Berlin had become a disconnected island in the midst of a hostile country, a cultural petri dish and sanctuary for West Germans who wanted to skip military service and collect a state pension. The pubs were open late. With reunification, the gravitational energy of the city moved east and the west dimmed. But the area retained its other meaning. I\u2019m talking about the enduring symbolism of the church, which is officially called the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Consecrated in 1895, long before the Second World War, it was built to celebrate Germany\u2019s victory in the Franco-Prussian War. Fast-forward a half-century, when Allied bombs struck the church in 1943. The jagged silhouette of the broken spire became a signpost of German madness. After the war, East Germany rebuilt historic landmarks, hoping to erase the memory of Nazism. But West Berliners preserved the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche as a ruin \u2014 a testament to the destruction and terror Germans brought upon themselves, a daily reminder never to forget. Philip Oltermann in Berlin on how the German chancellor is again under fire from political opponents who lay the blame for Berlin attack on her refugee strategy: Angela Merkel has vowed she will not allow Germany to be \u201cparalysed by fear\u201d after rightwing populist politicians rushed to blame the chancellor and her refugee policies for Monday evening\u2019s deadly truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market. Speaking at her chancellery on Tuesday morning, Merkel was quick to sketch out a worst-case scenario \u2013 unusually for a politician who prefers to deal in pragmatic solutions. \u201cGiven our current information, we have to assume we are dealing with a terrorist attack,\u201d she told reporters. But she added: \u201cWe do not want to live paralysed by the fear of evil. Even if it is difficult in these hours, we will find the strength for the life we want to live in Germany \u2013 free, together and open.\u201d Political opponents rejected her plea for unity, renewing their criticism of her refugee strategy and laying the blame for the attack unambiguously at her door. \u201cThe environment in which such acts can spread was carelessly and systematically imported over the past one and a half years,\u201d said Frauke Petry, leader of the rightwing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD). \u201cIt was not an isolated incident and it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Petry\u2019s partner, MEP Marcus Pretzell, posted a message on Twitter for what he called the \u201cLet\u2019s-wait-and-see brigade\u201d less than an hour after the attack: \u201cThis is what happens when you wait and see\u201d. Read the rest of the article here Of the 48 people injured in the attacks, 24 were released from hospital today, police said. From the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Berlin correspondent: From Kate Connolly and Philip Oltermann in Berlin: Lana Sefovac, a Bosnian who lives in Berlin, was at the entrance of the market drinking mulled wine with his family when the vehicle bore down upon him. \u201cI was standing in front of the stall. My father was in front of me. My mum was behind,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard a very, very noisy sound and when I turned towards it the first thing I saw was wood flying all around, because he literally smashed the first wooden booth by driving very fast. \u201cHe was driving directly toward us, directly into us. But then he made a turn because he did not want to drive into [our] booth, but to where people were. He wanted to run people over. He passed 20cm from my mum. She fell. My dad fell too. I turned and started screaming because I couldn\u2019t see my mum.\u201d Read the rest of their report here Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Christmas market in Berlin. The militant group claimed the assailant was an Isis \u201csoldier\u201d, who \u201ccarried out the attack in response to calls to target citizens of the international coalition\u201d, via its Amaq news agency. However, the group provided no evidence to support its claim that they had directed the attack. The AFP has some interesting detail about how police found and arrested Naved B, the 23-year-old man who has now been released by police due to lack of any evidence of his involvement: German daily Die Welt said a witness saw the suspected driver jump out of the vehicle\u2019s cab and trailed the individual for about 2km (1.2 miles), tipping off police about his location. Police released the man they had arrested shortly after the Berlin attack yesterday because of lack of evidence. Naved B, 23, had denied any involvement and investigation by authorities \u201cdid not result in an urgent grounds for suspicion\u201d. There had been difficulties interviewing Naved B as he speaks Balochi, a regional language of Pakistan. Police are still searching for the driver of the truck. Holger M\u00fcnch, the head of the federal criminal police, said: \u201cWe need to work on the assumption that an armed perpetrator is still on the loose. As a result of this we are on high alert.\u201d The Polish man found dead on the passenger side of the truck, Lukasz Urban, is regarded by police as a victim, not a suspect. He was a 37-year-old who had driven the truck from Poland to deliver steel beams in Berlin, described as a \u201cgood, quiet and honest person\u201d by his cousin Lukasz Wasik. It\u2019s not yet known how or if Urban\u2019s truck was hijacked. Beata Szydlo, Poland\u2019s prime minister, said Urban had been \u201cthe first victim of this heinous act of violence.\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the scene and wrote in a condolence book expressing her deep sadness for what had happened and that she hoped there would soon be answers to give to the relatives of the victims. Twelve people were killed and 48 injured, 18 left with serious injuries, after the Christmas market attack. As well as lighting up the Brandenburg Gate with the German flag, it\u2019s also being lit with the red, white and bear of the Berlin flag. The Federal Prosecutor\u2019s office issued a statement explaining they released the man they\u2019d arrested as a suspect, Naved B, as their investigations \u201cdid not result in an urgent grounds for suspicion.\u201d The (translated) statement reads in full: The accused man who had been temporarily arrested after the attack on the Berlin Christmas market on 19 December 2016 was released in the evening on the orders of the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The investigations so far did not result in an urgent grounds for suspicion. He made extensive statements in a police hearing but denied involvement. A complete tracking of the truck driver after the attack has not been done by eyewitnesses. The criminal investigations carried out so far have not been able to prove a presence of the accused during the incident in the truck. German prosecutors say the man who was arrested after the truck attack has been released because of insufficient evidence. The man, named as Naved B, a 23-year-old asylum seeker from Pakistan, was arrested after he was seen leaving the scene of the attack. However, police expressed doubts about whether the man they had arrested was indeed the person responsible for the attack. Michael Behrendt, a reporter with Die Welt, who first reported police doubts that they had the perpetrator, said one main reason the police were fairly certain early on they had not got the right man was the fact that he had no blood traces on him when he was apprehended immediately after the attack, whereas the truck cab was full of blood. The release of Naved B from custody may mean the driver of the truck is still at large, with fears that police do not know who is responsible for the attack. Refugees in Berlin have spoken of their fear that the attack on the Christmas market will turn their host nation against them. \u201cWe are of course worried,\u201d said Ibrahim Sufi, 26, a Syrian. \u201cWe are worried about how the German public will view us after this terrorist attack,\u201d added Sufi, tucking his hands into his red jacket to keep warm on a freezing morning. \u201cMy message to the Germans is: \u2018Don\u2019t suspect everybody, don\u2019t generalise.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe have nothing to do with this crime,\u201d said Ammar Wazzaz, a 45-year-old refugee from the Syrian city of Idlib. \u201cI hope that what this person did won\u2019t tarnish the reputation of refugees like us, who are very grateful to Germany.\u201d Yaser, a 32-year-old refugee from Syria, said he became dejected when he read about the attack on Facebook. \u201cWe fled this kind of terrorism and it is following us here,\u201d he said, adjusting a black beanie on his head. Read the full story: Organisers of Christmas markets in cities around the world have announced they are stepping up security measures in light of the attack on the Berlin market yesterday. Greater Manchester police released a statement earlier today to say they had \u201cstrengthened our policing presence at the Manchester Christmas markets and stepped up visible patrols\u201d. Chicago police announced they were \u201cclosely monitoring events [in] Berlin\u201d and while there was no specific threat against the Daley Plaza Christkindlmarket, they will deploy additional police officers, including \u201cadditional foot and bike patrols and specialized units\u201d to the market. Norwegian media are reporting that police are increasing patrols in Oslo and Bergen \u201cin places where large crowds gather, including the Christmas market in Spikersuppa\u201d. Copenhagen police also announced they would deploy more officers at Christmas markets and on the popular shopping street of Str\u00f8get following the attack. As the sun sets on Berlin the day after the attack on the Christmas market, in which 12 people died, the Brandenburg Gate is lit up with the black, red and gold of the German flag. Nigel Farage and Brendan Cox, the widower of Jo Cox, have been involved in a heated exchange on social media, in the wake of the Berlin attack, with the Ukip politician accusing Cox of supporting extremism. Farage tweeted earlier today that the incident in Berlin \u201cwill be the Merkel legacy\u201d, which prompted Cox to call on Farage not to blame politicians for the \u201cactions of extremists\u201d, calling it a \u201cslippery slope\u201d. Farage was asked about the Twitter exchange on radio and retorted that Cox \u201cwould know more about extremists than me\u201d, claiming that the organisation Hope Not Hate, set up in the name of his wife, the murdered Labour MP, was an extremist group. Read the full story, from Peter Walker: ThyssenKrupp has confirmed that the driver of the lorry arrived at the manufacturing company\u2019s Berlin warehouse on Monday \u2013 either in the morning or around midday \u2013 in an attempt to make an early delivery of the steel beams. The beams were supposed to be delivered on Tuesday morning. The company said it told the driver it could not unload his lorry at that time, however, and told him to return the next day at the scheduled drop-off time. ThyssenKrupp said it did not know where the lorry driver went next, but his cousin told reporters that he had parked in a nearby neighbourhood that the driver called \u201cstrange\u201d and then went to get food. Two British witnesses have been speaking to the BBC about trying to help the victims following the attack: Sarah Dobler described how she held the hand of one of the victims as he lay in the street while her boyfriend tried to help victims, before realising they were already dead. Dobler told BBC Radio 5 Live that she had held the male\u2019s hand until a member of the emergency services arrived. \u201cMy boyfriend was trying to help people that unfortunately had already passed but he was \u2026 I\u2019m not sure what nationality he was, I couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was on the floor, sorry to be graphic, but he was lying there, he was trying to get up but his head injury was quite severe. So I just held his hand and told him everything was going to be OK.\u201d She described the destruction of the scene as \u201clike something from a horror film\u201d. Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of German weekly Die Zeit, has written an opinion piece for the Guardian, in which he predicts an end to Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201copen door\u201d policy. Here is an extract: Above all, if the perpetrator does turn out to be a refugee, Merkel\u2019s \u201copen door\u201d policy on refugees will get a decisive make-over. Recall last year when she flung the country\u2019s doors wide open. Proclaiming \u201cwir schaffen das\u201d \u2013 we can do it \u2013 she essentially relinquished control over Germany\u2019s borders. Some 800,000 people from the Middle East as well as North Africa arrived. Merkel now says that if the perpetrator is indeed a refugee, \u201cthis would be extremely hard for us to bear,\u201d and it \u201cwould be particularly repugnant for all those Germans, who toil daily to help refugees\u201d. Thus do good intentions come to a nasty end. For Merkel, the \u201copen door\u201d was a grand moral gesture stemming from Germany\u2019s ugly past \u2013 an act of historical atonement. So is the ultra-liberal state that followed Nazi totalitarianism. \u201cNever again!\u201d explains why Germany, remembering the deadly fate of its Jews trying to escape extermination, opened its borders last summer. Controls are now back, and they will be tightened \u2013 as will domestic surveillance. The noblest of intentions go awry when terror legitimates anti-migrant and isolationist parties on the right, and on the far left. Populism is always both left and right. A few more terror assaults, and Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland \u2013 a political party roughly comparable to Ukip \u2013 will make hay in the 2017 general elections when Merkel runs for a fourth term. She will be eager to present herself as protector of domestic security \u2013 but within the constraints of a society that is as nervous about terror as it is protective of its sacred liberties. This story has just begun, and it is rife with speculation as to who did what and why. But one truth is inescapable: Germany, once lucky, has now joined the club of terror targets in the west, along with the US, Britain and France. My colleague Kate Connolly has seen the condolence book in the memorial church near where the attack took place: A glance in the condolence book shows the handwritten note left by Angela Merkel a short while ago, in which she expressed her deep regret for what had happened, said she was mourning with the victims and she hoped there would soon be answers to give to the relatives of the victims. Here\u2019s a roundup of what we know: German police believe those responsible for a deadly attack on a Berlin Christmas market could still be at large after admitting they could have arrested the wrong man. Holger M\u00fcnch, the head of the federal criminal police, said: \u201cWe need to work on the assumption that an armed perpetrator is still on the loose. As a result of this we are on high alert.\u201d The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has visited the scene of what she said was an assumed terrorist attack. \u201cIt would be particularly hard to bear for all of us if it was confirmed that a person committed this crime who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,\u201d she said. But M\u00fcnch admitted there was still a \u201cquestion mark\u201d over whether the attacker was an Islamist. The chief prosecutor, Peter Frank, said that investigators were assuming that it could have been a terrorist because of the number of people killed and similarities with the attack in Nice in July. But he stressed that nothing was proven Twelve people were killed in the incident on Monday, including six who have been identified as German. A further 48 people were wounded including 18 described as having very serious injuries. Police said a man found dead inside the truck, identified as a Polish citizen, was not the person who drove it into the market. He was stabbed and shot but the weapons have not been found. A Pakistani man arrested 2km from the scene has denied involvement. \u201cAt the moment it is unclear if he really was the driver,\u201d said the chief of Berlin\u2019s police, Klaus Kandt. Early on Tuesday, police reportedly raided a hangar at the disused Tempelhof airport in Berlin, part of which is being used to house refugees. Berlin police said they were investigating if the truck was stolen from a construction site in Poland. The Polish company that owns the truck said its 37-year-old driver, who was transporting steel beams, had been due to take a break in Berlin but had not been heard from since Monday afternoon. The White House condemned what it said \u201cappears to have been a terrorist attack\u201d. The president-elect, Donald Trump, called it a \u201chorrifying terror attack\u201d, blaming \u201cIsis and other Islamist terrorists [who] continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship\u201d. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, said the attack was \u201csavage in its cynicism\u201d. The rightwing populist party Alternative for Germany claimed the country\u2019s Christian tradition was under attack. Frauke Petry, its chair, said: \u201cThe Christmas market was not an accidental target. It is not only an attack on our freedom and our way of life, but on our Christian tradition. Germany is a country which is divided over the immigration question.\u201d Ukip\u2019s former leader Nigel Farage said \u201cevents like these will be the Merkel legacy\u201d. The Metropolitan police service in London is reviewing security at Christmas events in light of the attack. Holger M\u00fcnch, the head of the federal crime office, laid out more police doubts during the press conference. He said: \u201cCurrently we have one suspect but we are not sure whether he is the perpetrator and we don\u2019t know whether there is only one. We have not found the weapon and that leads us to being in a high state of alert. Our investigations are ongoing to see whether there are other perpetrators that we need to arrest.\u201d The chief prosecutor, Peter Frank, admitted that the apparent terrorist motive was still just an assumption. He said this was an assumption based on the \u201cmodus operandi, the similarities with the attack in Nice, and the number of dead\u201d. Michael Behrendt, a reporter with Die Welt, who first reported police doubts that they had the perpetrator, said investigators were \u201cabsolutely at a loss\u201d, writes Kate Connolly. \u201cThe police have no idea who they\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said. The relief that they had apparently arrested the perpetrator so soon after the attack has given way to a sense of helplessness, he said, comparing the search for the apparently armed attacker to \u201clooking for a needle in a haystack\u201d. \u201cThey have no weapon, no DNA traces,\u201d he said. CCTV footage filmed around Breitscheidplatz was being analysed in the hope it would yield information that might help to identify a suspect. \u201cUntil they have any concrete information, it\u2019s still completely unclear what they\u2019re dealing with,\u201d he said. Behrendt said one main reason the police were fairly certain early on they had not got the right man was the fact that he had no blood traces on him when he was apprehended immediately after the attack, whereas the lorry cab was full of blood. After laying white roses at the scene of the attack in front of the memorial church, Merkel held a lengthy discussion with Berlin police chiefs, writes Kate Connolly. She slowly walked through the scene of the carnage, talking to her ministers and accompanied by many security guards. She then entered the church \u2013 a Berlin symbol of peace, after it was seriously damaged in the second world war \u2013 where she was due to sign condolence books that Berliners have been queuing up to add their names to. The stillness of the market is striking. Normally at this time of the day it would be full of life and kitschy music. Instead, the wooden stalls not destroyed in the attack are closed up. The church\u2019s marine blue stained glass windows were lit up with candlelight. Here\u2019s an image of Merkel visiting the scene flanked by her most senior colleagues and the mayor of Berlin. Back at the prosecutors press conference, M\u00fcnch says: \u201cWe need to work on the assumption that an armed perpetrator is still on the loose. As a result of this we are on high alert.\u201d Angela Merkel is visiting the scene of the lorry attack. She is flanked by Berlin\u2019s mayor, Michael M\u00fcller, the interior minister Thomas De Maizi\u00e8re, and the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The chancellor lays flowers at the scene. Merkel is looking at letters, notes, and candles left by mourners \u2013 one sign reads: \u201cWhy?\u201d while another says: \u201cThe heart of Berlin has been hit.\u201d All the politicians are dressed in black. Close by, a plastic sheet marks the place the lorry crashed into the market. Six Germans have been identified among the dead, according to M\u00fcnch. Q: When did the Polish owner of the lorry report to police that his vehicle was missing? Kandt says the first time they knew about the existence of the lorry was after the attack had taken place. He said the fact the owner had no GPS contact to the lorry was unusual, and therefore it was not to be expected that he would have necessarily contacted the police. M\u00fcnch, one of the police chiefs, said if no video appears with a claim of responsibility for the attack, it could heighten suspicions that the attacker was a lone wolf. Questions are being asked as to why US authorities had apparently warned their own citizens to avoid Christmas markets in Germany, back in November, but German authorities did not issue such warnings. Another question being asked: why were no stone bollards erected at the market? Kandt, the Berlin police president, says even if we had put bollards up it would not have prevented the attack. He said there were \u201cso many potential targets\u201d \u2013 with 2,500 Christmas markets in Germany, 60 of them in Berlin. Holger M\u00fcnch, the head of the federal criminal police office, says there is a \u201cquestion mark\u201d over whether the attacker was an Islamists. Frank said the authorities should know by this evening whether they arrested the right man. He said it was still not clear whether it was a terrorist attack. He said prosecutors were working on the assumption that it could have been a terrorist act based on the method of the attack. But he stressed that nothing was proven. Berlin\u2019s police chief, Klaus Kandt, is defending the lack of concrete barriers at the Christmas market. He says the risk of terrorist attacks cannot be reduced to zero. Germany\u2019s top federal prosecutor, Peter Frank, has repeated doubts about whether the arrested suspect was behind the attack. \u201cWe have to get used to the idea that he may not have carried out the attack,\u201d he told a press conference in Berlin. Beatrix von Storch, an MEP with the rightwing Alternative for Germany party (AfD), has said Angela Merkel and her immigration policy are to blame for the attack. \u201cWe see our chancellor being personally responsible for what has happened. We were warning about this,\u201d she said. In an interview recorded for Radio 4\u2019s World at One programme before police expressed doubt about whether the suspect they were holding was the attacker, Von Storch said: \u201cIt is not possible to let in this many refugees. As far as we know, the terrorist of last night was one of them. \u201cWe think the policy of Angela Merkel and the way she is addressing the migrant crisis is responsible for what is happening.\u201d Earlier the AfD said Germany\u2019s Christian tradition was under attack. Annette Groth, of the Left party, accused the AfD of \u201cfuelling racist and xenophobic attitudes and thinking\u201d. She pointed out that immigrants committed fewer crimes than Germans. Theresa May was in touch with Angela Merkel last night to send a message of condolence, but the pair have not spoken by phone, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman has said. \u201cShe expressed that her thoughts are with the people of Berlin and we stand ready to assist in any way we can,\u201d he said. \u201cThe safety and security of British citizens is the government\u2019s No 1 priority. Clearly in the light of what has happened in Berlin police will be reviewing what is in place.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, tweeted that \u201cwe should not allow ourselves to be divided\u201d by the attack. Philip Oltermann summarising the key new line to emerge in the last hour: Police in Berlin are unsure whether the 23-year-old Pakistani suspect arrested last night is the attacker. \u201cAt the moment it is unclear if he really was the driver,\u201d said the chief of Berlin\u2019s police, Klaus Kandt. The owner of a Polish trucking company says the driver who was the first victim of the attack on a Christmas market in Berlin was stabbed and shot in the cabin of his truck, the Associated Press reports. Ariel Zurawski says German authorities asked him to identify the victim, Lukasz Urban, 37, from photos. \u201cHis face was swollen and bloodied. It was really clear that he was fighting for his life,\u201d Zurawski said, speaking to broadcaster TVN. Lukasz Wasik, the manager of the trucking company, described Urban as a \u201cgood, quiet and honest person\u201d devoted to his work. \u201cI believe he would not give up the vehicle and would defend it to the end if were attacked,\u201d Wasik said in comments carried by TVP, Poland\u2019s state broadcaster. The Berlin police Twitter feed has urged people to exercise caution as the suspect has denied carrying out of the attack. The chief of police in Berlin said there had been no further arrests, but if there were further suspects the police would do \u201ceverything to track them down\u201d. He added: \u2022 Police were appealing to people at the market to provide witness accounts, pictures and videos of the attack. \u2022 People in Berlin were urged to remain calm. \u2022 Plans for new year celebrations in Berlin would go ahead. \u2022 Security plans were under review. \u2022 A football match in Berlin tomorrow will have heightened security. \u2022 Christmas markets will continue, but with further security measures of large bollards and a large armed police presence. \u2022 Police gave thanks for the support being shown. The Berlin police chief has given a press conference. He has revealed that it is not absolutely clear whether the person in police custody is the driver involved in the attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. The man, an asylum seeker from Pakistan, has denied the offence. According to De Maizi\u00e8re, the suspect, Naved B, speaks Balochi, one of five regional languages spoken in Pakistan. De Maizi\u00e8re said there had been problems questioning him in the past because no translator could be found who spoke Balochi. Earlier in the press conference, he said the driver had fled the scene and that one of the 12 people who died was found dead on the passenger seat of the truck. He was shot with a pistol, De Maizi\u00e8re said. De Maizi\u00e8re said we \u201cmust not compromise our lifestyle, if we do that the enemies of freedom have already won\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are deeply saddened but we also fight for our freedom.\u201d He confirmed that Christmas markets in Berlin would be closed today, but open in the rest of Germany. \u201cTo simply stop would be wrong,\u201d he said. Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, has just given a press conference in Berlin. He confirmed reports that the arrested man is from Pakistan and had applied for asylum. He arrived in Germany on 31 December 2015 and in Berlin in February. De Maizi\u00e8re also confirmed that the man, arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack, denied the charges. De Maizi\u00e8re said he was not giving much attention to the Isis message claiming responsibility for the attack. He confirmed he would attend the vigil for the victims at 6pm in the memorial church on the square where the attack took place. De Maizi\u00e8re said police would not rest until they had completed their investigation into the attack. He urged once again for Christmas markets to remain open, but warned people to remain vigilant. He said it would be \u201ca lovely idea to go to a Christmas market and buy a crib\u201d. Welcome to our ongoing coverage of Monday evening\u2019s lorry attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. Here is what we know so far: The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said \u201cwe have to assume we are dealing with a terrorist attack\u201d after a truck was driven into a Christmas market in Berlin\u2019s Breitscheidplatz on Monday. \u201cIt would be particularly hard to bear for all of us if it was confirmed that a person committed this crime who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,\u201d she said. Twelve people were killed in the attack. A further 48 people have been taken to hospital with injuries, some of them are said to be fighting for their lives. Police said a man found dead inside the truck, identified as a Polish citizen, was not the person who drove it into the market. Witnesses said the truck drove into the market at speed, crushing people. The suspect, arrested at the 2km from the scene, entered the country via the so-called Balkan refugee route earlier this year, according to unconfirmed German media reports. Die Welt newspaper is reporting that he is a 23-year-old man from Pakistan, and that he had a temporary residence permit since June 2016. Early on Tuesday, police reportedly raided a hangar at the disused Tempelhof airport in southern Berlin, part of which is being used to house refugees. Berlin police said they were investigating if the truck was stolen from a construction site in Poland. Other reports said it was returning to Poland from Italy. The Polish company that owns the truck said its 37-year-old driver, who was transporting steel beams, had been due to take a break in Berlin but had not been heard from since Monday afternoon. The White House condemned what it said \u201cappears to have been a terrorist attack\u201d. The president-elect, Donald Trump, called it a \u201chorrifying terror attack\u201d, blaming \u201cIsis and other Islamist terrorists [who] continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship\u201d. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, said the attack was \u201csavage in its cynicism\u201d. The rightwing populist party Alternative for Germany claimed the country\u2019s Christian tradition was under attack. Frauke Petry, its main spokeswoman, said: \u201cThe Christmas market was not an accidental target. It is not only an attack on our freedom and our way of life, but on our Christian tradition. Germany is a country which is divided over the immigration question.\u201d Ukip\u2019s former leader Nigel Farage said \u201cevents like these will be the Merkel legacy\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
