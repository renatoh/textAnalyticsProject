Woodward, a board member of the European Club Association, emphasised he is involved in the ECA\u2019s collaborative partnership with Uefa on \u201cstrengthening of existing Uefa club competitions\u201d, widely expected to be an expansion of the Champions League. Speaking to a fans\u2019 forum on 20 November, whose minutes have now been published, Woodward said: \u201cMost of my time [regarding European competitions] is focused, through the ECA and the UCCSA [a joint-venture between the ECA and Uefa], on the strengthening of existing Uefa club competitions. The dialogue focuses on them continuing to be predominantly midweek games having little or no impact on the Premier League. \u201cWe believe any changes to European competition post-2024 must be complementary to thriving domestic leagues. Other domestic leagues feel the same way, reflected in conversation with our counterparts in other clubs and countries.\u201d The prospect of a breakaway was raised again in October with suggestions that the bank JP Morgan had been asked, by unnamed clubs, to consider a \u201cEuropean Premier League\u201d. The departing Barcelona president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, then said in his final speech in the role that the club\u2019s board had \u201cagreed to accept the conditions required to participate in a future European super league, a project led by Europe\u2019s big clubs\u201d. Woodward also defended United\u2019s involvement in the now-abandoned Project Big Picture plan to reshape English football, which proposed that the Premier League voting control be held by the \u201cbig six\u201d clubs, and share 25% of future TV revenue with the EFL. \u201cIt was not a behind-closed-doors power grab,\u201d Woodward told the supporters, \u201conly draft proposals and a discussion document.\u201d He indicated United would maintain the arguments behind those proposals in the strategic review the Premier League announced in response to the plan. \u201cA strong Premier League and a financially sustainable and robust pyramid are both crucial to the health of the national game, and that\u2019s the principle we will continue to pursue,\u201d he said. \u201cThose objectives were at the heart of our involvement in Project Big Picture.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
