This and other insights into the last months of the Chinese leader, who died on September 9, are now being provided in commemorative stories in the Peking press. Mao is described as having \"read every single news report\" on the Tangshan earthquake in spite of pleas from his attendants to rest. Although his sight had seriously weakened, he was able to read newspapers and periodicals in an extra large type specially prepared for him. A recent article in the People's Daily, written by the soldiers of Unit 8341 who formed Mao's personal guard at his residence in Peking, gives some idea of the Chairman's frugal lifestyle. \"Your shirts, blankets and shoes were worn thin from many years of use,\" the guards recall. During the difficult years which followed the Great Leap Forward (1959-61), Mao \"stopped eating meat and drinking tea, and shared weal and woe with the people around the country.\" Mao also encouraged his guards to plant fruit trees and vegetables around their quarters instead of growing \"decorative flowers.\" In summer he ordered their rooms to be sprayed when he heard they were troubled by mosquitoes. He also deterred his guards from \"putting on airs and accepting privileges\" in their unique position as the Chairman's closest attendants. Stories of this kind recall similar moral tales about the modest and selfless behaviour of Lenin which Chinese children read in their storybooks. But Mao was indeed known to everyone who visited him, from Edgar Snow in the 1930s during the Revolution up to the foreign leaders who came in recent years, as a man of simple tastes whose greatest indulgence was smoking, and eating hot peppers. The stories now being published after Mao's death are obviously devotional in character, but not hyperbolic. Indeed the mourning ceremonies throughout China have generally avoided overblown rhetoric. Mao is described \u2013 as he wished to be \u2013 as \"a great leader and teacher,\" but not as the \"greatest.\" Reuter adds from Peking: China has called off next Friday's National Day celebrations because of the death of Chairman Mao. The October 1 festivities, which mark the anniversary of the founding of Communist China, are traditionally a major holiday on the Peking calendar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
