Word's our bond Members of the Association of British Travel Agents, including tour operators Thomas Cook, Thomson Holidays, First Choice and MyTravel, will have to inform customers about whether they are financially bonded or not when they buy any of their products. At the moment, it is possible for Abta members to sell holiday products that are not protected, leaving cutomers at risk of financial loss should the company they booked with go bust. From January, they will have clearly to indicate bonded status in brochures and in person."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
