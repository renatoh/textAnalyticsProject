Music technology is no exception. The first time a previously unheard sound or technique is added to music, it can create a magical spin - what an old-school producer might call a bit of \"fairy dust\". Music has always looked for fresh sounds, and postwar science has provided an endless supply, along with new processes that consume musicians' time and money - far more than any pleasures of the flesh or pharmaceuticals. The latest electronics, once mastered, give composers and bands a chance to speak in the spirit of their time. Murcof's CD Martes (The Leaf Label) is a very assured debut, creating a sound world that's undeniably \"now\", yet conjuring an aura that is both active and peaceful; audaciously still. Murcof is Fernando Corona, a Mexican composer in his early 30s, whose CV includes music for film shorts, video games and contemporary dance companies and a more boring incarnation as Terrestre - part of the Nortec Collective. As Murcof, however, Corona's sound lies somewhere between Giya Kancheli and the Aphex Twin. Two sorts of static, you might say, since Corona has the former's penchant for pregnant pauses and the latter's knack of aestheticising the once taboo sounds of crackling interference . You might have expected a similar collision of radical tastes on the opening night of David Bowie's Meltdown, when a 50-plus version of the London Sinfonietta performed Philip Glass's Low Symphony and Heroes Symphony, two concert works based on instrumental tracks from the original Bowie albums. But it was the most lacklustre concert; Glass's reinventions lacked the conviction and energy of his own work, while losing the sonic charge of numbers such as Warszawa and Sense of Doubt. Glass's skill as an orchestrator stretched the melodic and harmonic materials to wan transparency; the Bowie instrumentals (some co-constructed with Brian Eno) were more about timbre and drama than tunes, chords and rhythm. When Low came out in the mid-1970s, its confident, shocking use (and misuse) of the studio toys of the time gave it a huge impact. Maybe it wasn't the first time anyone had used such ideas, but Bowie, a big star, was able to make them his own - to brand them. To hordes of impressionable fans it must have sounded like some dark witchcraft. One of the pleasures of Low, apart from a handful of laughably enjoyable pop songs, is the way the analogue synthesisers and studio noises (not to mention the wayward voices and out-of-tune saxophones) are given so much space. It is full of hollows - the album sounds a bit hurried and unfinished. But Bowie's chums turned that to their advantage. Where producers such as Phil Spector and George Martin created grandiose pop by layering instruments and voices, Tony Visconti, Low's co-producer, made it sound big by separating and stripping things down. Fernando Corona pulls off a similar trick. The rhythm parts on Martes are constructed from tiny blips and blops, almost subliminal in their effect, but funkily right in the pocket. And the melodic and textural parts tend to be slow and languorous, unruffled by the pesky little beats. I guess the whole album could have been made on a laptop, yet the project has a rare feeling of size and space that goes with the unhurried structure of the individual pieces. Corona appears live tomorrow night at Kuumba in Bristol, and in early July as part of the ICA's Laptops Live in London. I'll be there, trying to figure out how he does it, because I don't believe in magic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
