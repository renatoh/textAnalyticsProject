I took it in the winter of 2003 \u2013 it's always snowy at that time of year, and the area around the bottom of the falls, where people are walking, is usually a small lake. But it was \u201315C that day: so cold it had iced over. I was visiting a friend, and we'd gone to a spot on the other side of the gorge. I happened to have a little digital camera on me \u2013 what at the time was a high-end compact, but today would be worse than your phone. The place looked so amazing, I took a few shots. There was something about the cold that made the place where the falling water landed a mass of crazy steam and foam. That's why the colours are so weird. But the really strange thing about this picture, why I like it so much, is that my hands were shaking with the cold. As a result, the image has a slight blur. I went back two more times with my fancy medium-format camera to replicate the shot but it never looked right. Everything that was wrong with this shot was what made it so good. The image has an ominous feel. At the time, I was shooting a lot of beautiful winter landscapes that had a sinister feeling. This was during the buildup to the Iraq war, so I wanted to make images that had a sense of history and knowledge slipping away, being covered up. That's what the snow is doing. And the people walking toward the waterfall are literally walking on thin ice. Logic tells you they're on the ground \u2013 but in the picture, they're just floating in white space.
