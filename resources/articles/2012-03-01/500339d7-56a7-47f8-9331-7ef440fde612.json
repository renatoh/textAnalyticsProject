After about three weeks of telling them I did not have any accounts with them and that they had the wrong person, the calls stopped. In one of the calls I had foolishly told them my date of birth. Just before Christmas the calls started again, this time followed by letters demanding \u00a31,535.93. I got my credit reference from Experian and the scales fell from my eyes. It is clear that last August NatWest linked me to someone with a similar name, unrelated to me and living miles away, who does appear to owe them money. I wrote to NatWest on 19 January with this information and copies of the debt collector's letters and my credit report but, so far, the response has been unsatisfactory. RC, Leigh-on-sea, Essex This was a distressing case of mistaken identity, which could have been avoided had the debt recovery agents done a better job of finding the right person. NatWest has assured us you won't be contacted about this again and that there will be no impact on your credit rating. By way of apology it has sent you \u00a3250. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Bachelor &amp; Brignall, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
