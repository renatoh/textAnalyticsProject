Whether it was comic keeping, violence or goals, there was always plenty to grab the attention. The difficulty yesterday was keeping one's eyes open. Perhaps someone should have brought in Alpay Ozalan to liven things up. A lack of crowd trouble was a positive note and only once did things threaten to boil over on the pitch. Yet, if that was good news, the absence of quality and goalmouth incident was less endearing. Needless to say Villa were happier with this stalemate after recent chastening experiences. After two straight defeats by their fiercest rivals they at least showed an organisation and appetite for battle which earned them a deserved point. David O'Leary had said this was \"going to answer a lot of questions about where we are going\". The answer is nowhere fast, though there has been progress. How far Birmingham have come in a short time was shown by their disappointment, despite regaining fourth place. \"I can remember when I was happy and the players were happy to be fourth from bottom,\" said the chairman and co-owner David Gold. Villa stay in the bottom half but had the most eye-catching individuals of a game characterised by graft and errors. Olof Mellberg was excellent in central defence, where Ronny Johnsen also did well. Gavin McCann had a fine first half and Gareth Barry impressed after the interval having moved into a more central position after an injury to Lee Hendrie. It was always difficult to see where Villa would find the invention to break down their opponents and they did not force Ian Bennett into a testing save. Thomas Sorensen was equally underworked after a good early stop from Stephen Clemence. Blues fans must have wondered where Peter Enckelman was when they needed him. Birmingham had the obvious match-winners but have failed to score in three straight games. David Dunn was well below par and Christophe Dugarry was also poor, three times taking the wrong option when space opened up. Steve Bruce was honest with his assessment. \"One good thing is that we can go and have Sunday roast now,\" the Birmingham manager said. \"It will be more enjoyable than that. Both teams were scared to lose and there was very little football played. We are disappointed because we believe we are better than that.\" One of the best performers was the referee Mike Riley who, unusually, drew praise from both managers. Bruce and O'Leary rightly highlighted Riley's \"common sense\". In other potentially less volatile matches Riley would surely have issued more than three cautions but he showed a good understanding of the occasion. The players, too, were generally restrained. Only when Dunn continued to play unaware that Hendrie had been injured by a crude McCann foul did things overheat. Bruce was screaming at Dunn to stop but said his player had not heard. O'Leary got into a shouting match with Dunn but later absolved him. The Irishman preferred to dwell on Villa's success in winning back \"a bit of pride\". Hendrie, who will be out for three weeks with a calf injury, said he could not remember the team being \"so up for it\". Villa could have fallen behind early on and survived a penalty appeal when Mikael Forssell tangled with Mark Delaney, though Bruce, continuing the conciliatory theme, had no complaints. Villa came closest when Damien Johnson nicked the ball off the toes of Peter Whittingham. Dull it may have been but, after last season's excesses, perhaps for the best. Man of the match: Olof Mellberg (Aston Villa): The rock of Villa's defence, he was particularly dominant in the air against the City striker Mikael Forssell. Best moment: Pick from any number of vital interceptions when Birmingham threatened to find a route to the Villa goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
