The injustice he feels at the penalty awarded to Eden Hazard during Arsenal\u2019s 2-2 draw with Chelsea last Wednesday has not yet faded and, when the pair meet again in Wednesday\u2019s League Cup semi-final first leg, any repeat of a decision he called \u201cfarcical\u201d would risk something akin to spontaneous combustion high in the Stamford Bridge stands. That is where Wenger will spend the match, as a continuing legacy of his similarly outraged reaction to West Bromwich Albion\u2019s spot-kick on 31 December but he is not yet ready to view what he saw as a dive from Hazard at a remove. Initially misunderstanding a question about Antonio Conte\u2019s claim that it was his \u201cway\u201d to query referees, he ended up inadvertently agreeing with the Chelsea manager while airing his grievances about Hazard again. \u201cI questioned the decision of the referee. Then, we are objective. You look at the picture. You see how Hazard goes down and you see how quickly he takes the penalty when he gets the penalty,\u201d he said of the forward\u2019s reaction to a challenge offered by H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn. \u201cIf he was so injured why did he take the penalty? He made more of it, [like a] professional, basically, and shouts. I can understand that. I do not blame Hazard. He acted in a very professional way to get the penalty for his team, which he did well.\u201d Another objective view is that it was a clear penalty and that, Hazard\u2019s overreaction notwithstanding, Wenger\u2019s energy is misdirected on a call nowhere near as egregious as that taken by Mike Dean at The Hawthorns. Yet it is the latter that has cost him his place in the dugout and, as he watches his team battle to retain their only chance of a domestic trophy, there will be familiar feelings of helplessness. Last February a four-match ban for pushing the fourth official Anthony Taylor \u2013 coincidentally the referee who judged Beller\u00edn to have fouled Hazard \u2013 included a 3-1 league defeat at Stamford Bridge. He watched from a designated area in the East Stand and remembers the situation as \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d and \u201cawkward\u201d, not aided by his location near the home support or the time-consuming walk to the dressing rooms. \u201cI will try to find a different place,\u201d he said of Wednesday evening\u2019s seating plan and he will hope the same can be said of his players, too. Wenger was rattled by Arsenal\u2019s lifeless FA Cup surrender at Nottingham Forest on Sunday, describing himself as \u201cvery disappointed with some individual performances\u201d. It is certainly not a good look when Alex Iwobi, a young player who has no business feeling sure of a future in the top bracket at this stage, is purportedly seen partying on the weekend of a Cup tie, especially when the manager subsequently felt compelled to defend his own attitude towards knockout competitions. \u201cNobody has won the FA Cup more than I did but still it is [seen as] an absolute disaster,\u201d he said of the 4-2 defeat. \u201cGet somebody to win it more and then I say, \u2018OK, well done.\u2019 But nobody in the whole history of English football won it more, so I always took the competition in a serious way. I am unhappy to go out, of course, but you must accept as well that there\u2019s no guarantee you will win it every year.\u201d Wenger\u2019s next segue, though, told more about what is at stake over these two legs. His argument was unfashionable but compelling: the cups will grow in significance because, with so much money around and only one title winner, tangible reward becomes increasingly precious. \u201cMany, many teams today invest a huge amount of money and are all hungry for trophies,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody wants to fold that away. I think it will become even more important because so many teams are hungry for trophies that everybody goes for it.\u201d The theory holds some weight, although it would require a recalibration of what, nowadays, is popularly defined as success for the top six clubs. For Arsenal anything will do at this stage and their recent attacking performances, certainly at home, suggest a return to their best cup form is not beyond them. The difficulty is that it would take supreme confidence to predict the makeup of Wenger\u2019s squad for the rematch a fortnight from now: his eyes offered less confidence than his words when he said there had been no contact with Manchester City over Alexis S\u00e1nchez, a counterproductive presence this season whose future will be resolved if a \u00a320m offer is accepted. Squad players like Francis Coquelin, Mohamed Elneny and even Theo Walcott could also move on; Arsenal can damage Chelsea but not if a team in flux has a significant first-leg deficit to claw back. Up in the gods, Wenger will hope a combination of his defence and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 the officials can subdue Hazard this time. It will be tough viewing from afar but perhaps he will keep good company. When he took that unsatisfactory vantage point 11 months ago, he was wrong-footed to find himself sitting next to his own gardener. An embarrassed Wenger had failed to recognise him; in the event of a repeat arrangement he might feel tempted to ask whether, just this once, everything could come up smelling of roses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
