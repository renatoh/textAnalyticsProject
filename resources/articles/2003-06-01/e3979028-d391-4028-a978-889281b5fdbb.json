The idea of bringing together the 137 local organisations that coordinated the work of court welfare officers was intended to drive up standards and iron out variations in practice. But instead I watched in dismay as one of the key aspects of the child protection system in England and Wales was eroded. I have worked in public law cases (care proceedings and adoption) as a children's guardian - formerly known as a guardian ad litem - since 1991. The guardian's role evolved in the wake of the inquiry into the death of Maria Colwell, who was battered to death by her stepfather after being returned home from foster parents on the order of the court. The inquiry recommended that an independent welfare expert should be appointed to advise the courts of the child's best interests. The role of the children's guardian has been described as the \"the lynchpin of the Children Act\". Guardians are appointed by the family courts and are responsible for assessing whether children's best interests lie in staying with their families or going into local authority care. This decision is rarely easy. On the one hand the child has often been put at risk due to poor parenting; on the other hand placing them in local authority care is not without its own risks. The guardian conducts a thorough investigation and prepares a report for the court, making a recommendation of what would be best for the individual child. Significantly they act independently of the child's parents and social services departments. The children in the public law proceedings are exceptionally vulnerable. They are at risk of being permanently removed from their families. Many of them have been abused or neglected. Some are young people who present such a risk to themselves or to others that they are deprived of their liberty and placed in secure accommodation. However, the board and senior management of Cafcass do not appear to appreciate the complexity of the guardian's role. Structural reform appears to have taken precedence over children's welfare. Prior to the creation of Cafcass 95% of public law cases were allocated within 24 hours. But that standard has slipped. The agency says that 80% of cases are now allocated in seven days and its aim is to cut the maximum waiting time down to 48 hours - twice what it was. This delay is extremely worrying. Early intervention by an independent childcare expert can save the life of a baby who would otherwise be placed in or returned to a dangerous environment. On other occasions, the guardian can ensure a child returns home, with adequate protection, early in the proceedings. After a child has remained in care for 12 weeks, they are far less likely to settle back in to the family home. The guardian also ensures that a young person stays in touch with close relatives and can persuade local authorities to track down far-flung family members who are able to care for them. Cafcass believes children can wait for these services. It says there are now 639 public law cases awaiting the allocation of a guardian. So between 1,200 and 1,500 of the most vulnerable children in our society lack an independent person to investigate their circumstances and represent their best interests in court. Cafcass has compromised the values and principles of child protection. In light of this situation I found myself unable to fulfil my duties to the courts and to children. For that reason I have ceased work as a children's guardian. \u00b7 Veronica Swenson represented children in court for 22 years, first as a family courts welfare officer and then a self-employed children's guardian.
