'No, we haven't had any sales today, or yesterday or this week. Actually, we haven't had any for a few months now, 'Crist said from the air-conditioned comfort of the professional's shop at Furnace Creek Golf Club. Outside it was a mere 45C (114F) - compared with a record in Britain last week of nearly 36C (97F) - just an average August day in Death Valley. Crist, 48, has run the shop for nine years. 'We don't get many golfers in the summer. The hottest temperature recorded since I've been here is 130F, but I've been out playing golf when it's been 125F. 'As long as you drink a lot of water and don't spent too much time out in the sun looking for your golf ball you'll be all right.' Death Valley experienced the second highest verified temperature ever recorded in the world, 57C, on 10 July 1913. From the beginning of May until the end of August, its daytime temperatures rarely dip below 38C, while the heat index - a combined measure of air temperature and humidity - can touch 150. The annual rainfall over the last 50 years has averaged just 1.66 inches. These extremes and a stunning geographical backdrop have made the valley popular with tourists, even during its sweltering summers. 'It's a beautiful place to visit for a day, but living here is different altogether,' Crist said. 'It tends to drive folks away. Sure, it's great that the water in the outdoor swimming pool is always hot, but what use is that when you're lonely all the time? It's not the heat that's the problem, it's the isolation. 'Am I going to be here for the next nine years? Unfortunately, it kinda looks like it.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
