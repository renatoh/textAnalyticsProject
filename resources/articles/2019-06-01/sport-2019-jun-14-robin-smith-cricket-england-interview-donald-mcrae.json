There were no half measures\u2019", "bodyText": "\u201cI was sitting on the beach in Perth, with the Rendezvous hotel behind me, and I thought: \u2018How am I going to end my life?\u2019 Robin Smith says calmly. The former England Test batsman, who was renowned for his bravery against brutal fast bowling between 1988 and 1996, shows a deeper courage as he relives the darkest days of his life since he retired from cricket and moved to Australia. On a dreary summer afternoon in London, Smith makes it feel as if we are on an empty beach on a winter evening in Perth. I can feel the pain that surged through him in 2013 as he drained a bottle of vodka. \u201cI knew I should stop drinking,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut it gave me an escape where I didn\u2019t feel so guilty. Everything seemed slightly rosier because of that injection of vodka through my veins.\u201d Smith has been sober for a long time but, still, it is not easy returning to the darkness. \u201cI knew I was going to commit suicide but I didn\u2019t know exactly what day it would be and how I was going to do it. I always felt I didn\u2019t have the guts to buy a gun. I wouldn\u2019t have known where to get a gun and shoot myself. But I knew I would be able to have some medication, two bottles of vodka and a cigarette before I jumped off the top of the building. I had that in me.\u201d We were both schoolboys in South Africa in the late 1970s. I lived near Johannesburg and Smith in Durban. Even then, and being a few years older than him, I had heard of Smith. The cricket I played was nowhere near his standard but I heard breathless tales of Smith the teenage prodigy. From six o\u2019clock every summer morning, he faced balls flying at speed from a bowling machine fed by his father in their back garden. Barry Richards and Mike Procter, two great South Africa cricketers who lost their best years in the Test game to the justified sports boycott against apartheid, sometimes practised with Smith in his garden. He was that gifted. Now, the 55-year-old Smith has written a profoundly moving book with the Guardian\u2019s Rob Smyth. It is called The Judge, which is the nickname Smith was given in Durban as a schoolboy when his frizzy hair, now as grey as mine, resembled a judge\u2019s wig. Smith acknowledges he has been fortunate to find a gifted writer as knowledgable and empathetic as his near namesake. Smyth is an expert on the bludgeoning brilliance of Smith at his best, in a struggling England team who won only 14 of 62 Tests he played, but the ghostwriter has allowed the vulnerable man inside the swaggering cricketer to express his doubts in an ultimately uplifting way. Smith still relives some harrowing memories. \u201cWhen my life fell apart, my business too, one of the big mistakes I made was collecting my daughter from school having drunk far too much. She understood I was drunk because I went over a kerb and she asked to get out the car. That broke my heart. It destroyed me, knowing I did wrong. A parent is there to keep their children safe, and I did the total opposite.\u201d When he was stopped by the police later that day they made him retake a breathalyser test because they thought their machine was faulty. Smith had a blood alcohol level in excess of 0.4. Most people are unconscious if the reading is 0.3, in a coma at 0.4 and dead at 0.5. \u201cWhen I was in the bowels of depression, I\u2019d take half a bottle to the beach and not see any way out. I drank vodka straight from the bottle. There were no half measures. The point of taking my life was getting close until my son saw me curled up in my apartment. He said how much I was still loved. Then my brother, Chris, stepped in. I stayed at their place for nine months. My drinking got slightly better but it was only ever going to be for a short time. I moved to another apartment and fell again because I was sad and guilty.\u201d Smith had resolved not to jump out of a hotel window, for the sake of his children, but his family despaired as he kept drinking. He needed the help of his new partner, Karin, who sits alongside him during this interview and sometimes reaches out to hold his hand. \u201cI saw a good man with a bad problem,\u201d she says. Slowly, amid the occasional relapse, Smith sobered up. Karin convinced him to trust Smyth and they agreed to tell a story where Smith\u2019s bold cricket career is balanced by his frailties in retirement. As Smith and his partner returned to the Rendezvous hotel last year to discuss his suicidal moods, they witnessed a tragedy. \u201cKarin went for a shower,\u201d Smith says. \u201cI took a coffee on to the balcony. That\u2019s when it happened.\u201d Smith saw a body hurtling past and \u201cI heard that terrible smash. I shouted to Karin, jumped over the railing and went down. This woman had wedged herself in a drain. She was still breathing and her eyes were open and looking at us. I held her hand, and Karin held her other hand, as we waited for the paramedics. We never found out where she came from, because they don\u2019t give out that information. I wanted to let her family know we were with her in her last moments. As we held her hand, we saw blood trickle out of her mouth, and then it was over. I just said: \u2018Fuck.\u2019\u201d Could it have been him crumpled in the drain? \u201cYes. I was so, so close. You tell yourself: \u2018I\u2019m a bloody hindrance. I\u2019m causing too much pain, too much embarrassment.\u2019 I thought the best thing was to end it.\u201d Smith\u2019s depression began soon after his contract with Hampshire, whom he had joined 21 years previously, was not extended in 2003. The day before his 40th birthday he felt betrayed and, without the routine of cricket, Smith was adrift. His identity fractured. \u201cThere\u2019s always been two sides to my character. One would be Robin Smith, very loyal, gentle, kind, not having confidence even when someone sees you as a big, powerful bloke. When I got to England I had to try to gather more arrogance, because I did not believe in myself.\u201d The Judge, dispatching ferocious fast bowling to the boundary, took over \u2013 merging with the hard-drinking Judgie who loved socialising with Ian Botham, Allan Lamb, Viv Richards, Shane Warne and other great players who all said Smith was the nicest man in cricket. Yet Smith hid his true, vulnerable self. \u201cI\u2019ve found a happy medium now,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly as writing the book has been very cathartic. I bared my soul to the world.\u201d The great documentary Fire In Babylon, about the dominant West Indies team, features Smith facing some chilling fast bowling. He weaves and leaps out of the way but still gets hit by a sickening blow that fractures his cheekbone. \u201cThe challenge of the West Indies paled into insignificance compared to the challenges I faced after my cricketing days. I look back and cricket was quite easy.\u201d He had the most ferocious square cut in the game. Mike Selvey, the Guardian\u2019s former cricket correspondent who played for England, is quoted on the back of the book: \u201cShould I ever be condemned to beheading, I would like Robin Smith to be the swordsman.\u201d For Michael Vaughan, \u201cThe Judge \u2013 or \u2018My Hero\u2019 as I knew him \u2013 had the aura, personality and swagger that all of us young players wanted. I spent hours trying to master his signature square cut.\u201d Smith relished taking on the world\u2019s most menacing quicks. \u201cI loved it. However, I shudder now when I see guys getting smacked in the grill. I think: \u2018How on earth did I bat for [23] years professionally?\u2019 But I was far more nervous facing Shane Warne.\u201d Smith coped with Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh and Ian Bishop but \u201cSylvester Clarke was always the most sinister. Any cricketer of my generation will say he was the most dangerous. Like Andy Roberts, he actually wanted to hit you. If they couldn\u2019t get you out they\u2019ll knock you out. They wouldn\u2019t think twice about seeing you carried off on a stretcher. I used to go to the bar afterwards and buy Sylvester lots of drink, hoping he would go easy on me. The next day he still wanted to hurt me. But I never felt fear. Even Waqar Younis, who hated me and often said: \u2018I\u2019m going to fucking kill you\u2019 could not scare me.\u201d In his fearless pomp, while scoring some magnificent Test hundreds that left him with a batting average of 43.67, The Judge was insecure away from the crease. When he asked Keith Fletcher, his England coach, if he would consider bringing in a sports psychologist, Smith says he was told: \u201cAnyone who needs a fucking psychiatrist shouldn\u2019t be fucking playing for England.\u201d Smith, who is relieved that mental health in sport is discussed more openly today, shakes his head. \u201cFor [Fletcher] not to know the difference between a sports psychologist and a psychiatrist was sad. Loads of coaches didn\u2019t have a clue. They just said: \u2018Man up and be tough.\u2019 But [depression] happens to many of us and you should get help before you fall too deeply into that hole. You have to accept it\u2019s going to be very humbling. People will know how fragile you are.\u201d If he had opened up to Botham and Lamb would his great drinking buddies have been equipped to help him? \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question because, again, they probably wouldn\u2019t understand. I get on so very well with them and I\u2019m sure they would have tried to help in some way. But I don\u2019t think they understand how it feels being unconfident, shy and reserved.\u201d Smith now enjoys coaching young players in Perth. \u201cI\u2019ve got that love back. I was disillusioned watching cricket, maybe depressed, because I still hadn\u2019t got over the need to continue playing, but I love coaching. Sometimes I get the bat and show them how to play a couple of shots. I\u2019m not being arrogant but I still play a beautiful cover drive.\u201d He smiles and speaks with raw honesty. \u201cWhen I was a cricketer I drank socially, because I was a party animal. I don\u2019t think I was an alcoholic then. But when the wheels fell off, for seven years, I would have been an alcoholic. I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll remain an alcoholic the rest of my life. If I can keep clean for a few years maybe I can be disciplined enough to drink in moderation.\u201d After conquering so many demons is he happy now? \u201cI am very happy. There is lots more I can do to improve but I\u2019m moving in the right direction. I have the discipline these days to know what\u2019s right and wrong \u2013 but we can always try to be nicer and be the very best we can.\u201d In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.
