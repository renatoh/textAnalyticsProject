Allegedly responding to public pressure (come on, own up), this retro karaoke experience boasts, \"a new '80s-themed intro, retro colour scheme, fully licensed tracks from the original artists, and, of course, the videos that ushered in the dawn of music TV\". A brief glimpse at the tracklist (peeked at gingerly through my fingers) reveals such classics as 99 Red Balloons, Tainted Love, The Final Countdown and Come On Eileen. God help us, its every wedding disco from the last twenty years on one shiny disc. It's a no-brainer for Sony though: combine two popular mainstream entertainment themes - the 'everyone's a performer' ethos of reality TV and eighties nostalgia - into one product. How long before pop culture completely consumes itself and we end up with SingStar Ring Tone classics? Whole families gathered around the PS3 doing Crazy Frog impressions... Is that more or less disturbing than secret videogame sex scenes? You can, if you must, view the whole SingStar '80s tracklist here...
