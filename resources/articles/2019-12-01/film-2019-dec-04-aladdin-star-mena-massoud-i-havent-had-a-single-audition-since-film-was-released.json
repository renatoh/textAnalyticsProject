Massoud told the Daily Beast: \u201cI\u2019m kind of tired of staying quiet about it \u2026 I want people to know that it\u2019s not always dandelions and roses when you\u2019re doing something like Aladdin. \u2018He must have made millions. He must be getting all these offers.\u2019 It\u2019s none of those things. I haven\u2019t had a single audition since Aladdin came out.\u201d Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie and co-starring Will Smith, was released in May and has just passed $1bn at the global box office. Massoud added: \u201cIt\u2019s like, I\u2019m sitting here being like, OK, Aladdin just hit $1 billion. Can I at least get an audition? I\u2019m not expecting you to be like, here\u2019s Batman! But can I just get in the room? Can you just give me a chance? So it\u2019s not always what you think.\u201d The actor ascribed the problem to his lack of experience in the industry, as well as the negative effects of starring in a family blockbuster. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to be overlooked and underestimated for a long time because I am a young actor. I\u2019ve been doing this for 10 years, but to a lot of people, Aladdin\u2019s the first thing they\u2019ve seen me in. So I think I\u2019m going to be viewed that way for a long time. I\u2019m going to have to work at chipping away at that.\u201d However, Massoud has been given a major role in the Hulu TV series, Reprisal, which he secured before Aladdin was released."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
