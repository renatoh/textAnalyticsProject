Their unique lineup (three saxes and a trumpet) and appetite for inviting tunes briskly delivered (there are 15 tight tracks here, with covers including Joe Zawinul's sensuously soulful Walk Tall and an elated version of the anthemic Sunny) has made them a popular draw, but the quality of their writing puts them in a different class to the standard hook-strutting, all-horn group. Most of the pieces are originals, from unorthodox pieces such as Heads Down, Thumbs Up or trumpeter Ryan Quigley's mercurial For Those of Us, to familiar jazz structures on Always the Last Word, or vaporous exercises in tone colour on the delicately whirring Imaginary Friend. The Mel Torme hit Comin' Home Baby is a funky jam for hurtling solos, but the systems-music twister Talisman Home is a total contrast. Guest trombonist Michael Owers adds sumptuous extra depth to a fine set on the slow, gospelly finale (inspired by Aretha Franklin and Charles Mingus), Charles Franklin Blues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
