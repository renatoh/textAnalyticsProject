But, while that line epitomises the author\u2019s own generosity of spirit, which comes through clearly in James Macdonald\u2019s typically meticulous production, there is a languor to the play that marks it out from Williams\u2019s earlier driven masterpieces. The setting is the veranda of a hotel in the Gulf of Mexico in 1940 and the four main characters are in different stages of desperation. Maxine Faulk, the hotel\u2019s recently widowed owner, has an unsatisfied hunger for life. The Rev Shannon, locked out of his church for fornication and heresy and reduced to escorting bus parties around Mexico, arrives to suffer one of his periodic crack-ups. He finds an unexpected soulmate in the virginal Hannah Jelkes, a watercolourist who roams the world hustling a meagre living with her 97-year-old grandfather, who is struggling to complete his final poem. Like Chekhov, Williams offers a hymn to human endurance. While I admire his compassion for four wrecked souls, the most problematic character is Shannon, whom I find it difficult to like. Clive Owen, in dilapidated white linen suit, plays him with the right nervous intensity, signalled by a shaking right hand. But Shannon is accused of seducing an underage girl, cruelly abandons the Texan Baptist ladies in his charge, constantly insults Maxine and appears to relish his breakdown. Owen faithfully captures all this but there is an element of narcissism to Shannon\u2019s neurosis that keeps you at a distance. Much the most fascinating character is Hannah, unforgettably played by Eileen Atkins in Richard Eyre\u2019s 1992 National Theatre revival. Lia Williams brings her own particular qualities to the role \u2013 suggesting an inner toughness and sharp wit beneath this spry, bird-like solitary. When a trussed-up Shannon claims, \u201cA man can die of panic,\u201d Williams quickly retorts: \u201cNot if he enjoys it as much as you.\u201d Even if her accent occasionally veers from old Scotland to New England, Williams renders Hannah\u2019s account of her two brief sexual encounters with a deeply touching acceptance of the waywardness of human passion. Anna Gunn, best known as Skyler White in Breaking Bad, lends the proprietary Maxine a radiant sensuality that belies her profound loneliness and rampant jealousy. Julian Glover hints at a wicked humour in the nonagenarian poet and reads his final poem with great dignity, while Finty Williams invests a mercilessly abused vocal teacher with a justified outrage. Rae Smith has created a monumental set dominated by a sheer, weather-beaten cliff and Neil Austin\u2019s lighting, poetically capturing the stormy sunsets of the tropics, is as moving as anything in the evening. It is all very well done. Yet, while this is often described as Williams\u2019s last really good play, it carries intimations of his decline. It is full of underdeveloped characters, including a quartet of cartoonish German tourists noisily rejoicing in the bombing of London. The parallel between the captive iguana, tied by the throat and craving freedom, and Hannah\u2019s dying grandfather is also remorselessly spelt out. I felt as I did at a recent revival of Orpheus Descending: this may not be vintage Williams, but it survives through its opportunities for actors and the author\u2019s boundless charity. \u2022 At No\u00ebl Coward theatre, London, until 28 September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
