The domestic violence report was tabled in the Senate on Thursday and makes 25 recommendations after 12 months of public hearings. The report recommends that the commonwealth look at ways of facilitating domestic violence leave for the public and private sectors. But government senators on the inquiry committee, while not dissenting from the report\u2019s broad conclusions, said flexible leave conditions already existed. Comments added to the report by the Liberal backbencher Cory Bernardi stated: \u201cIf an employer wishes to provide additional entitlements, they can do so through enterprise bargaining.\u201d The Greens backed the Australian Council of Trade Union\u2019s calls for a mandatory 10 days of domestic violence leave. \u201cThe Australian Greens recommend that the federal government legislate to give every employee 10 days of non-accumulating paid domestic violence leave to be taken for reasons related to domestic violence or for attending court appearances, attending appointments and finding accommodation,\u201d the deputy Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said in comments added to the report. The report also calls on the federal government to do more to find affordable housing to support survivors of domestic violence who have been forced to leave their home. \u201cThe committee heard that the lack of affordable longer-term housing options for victims of domestic and family violence means women and their children need to remain in crisis accommodation for a much longer period, which in turn results in the lack of availability of crisis accommodation,\u201d the report said. The government has made homelessness services for victims of domestic violence a priority in the $230m joint commonwealth- and state-run national partnership agreement on homelessness. A snapshot of demographic trends released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, found that a third of people seeking emergency housing support were fleeing domestic violence. It recommended that special focus be placed on how to support male victims of domestic violence, who cannot access women\u2019s shelters and gender-specific services. Understanding perpetrators from Indigenous, rural and non-English speaking communities, as well as those in same-sex relationships, and setting out specific intervention tactics for these groups should also be a priority, the report said. The institute\u2019s report found that women accounted for 85% of the victims of domestic violence. Two million Australians have suffered intimate partner violence and a further million have suffered violence perpetrated by other family members. Indigenous women are 34 times more likely to be admitted to hospital owing to domestic violence than the general population. \u2022 Anyone affected by sexual assault or domestic violence can call 1800RESPECT or 1800 737 732, or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
