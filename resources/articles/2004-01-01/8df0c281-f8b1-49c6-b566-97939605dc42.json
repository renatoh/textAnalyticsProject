The UK DNA Companion Animal Archive, a joint venture between UK veterinary schools and the Animal Health Trust, will be based in the university's faculty of veterinary science. It will contain DNA samples taken, with their owners' permission, from cats, dogs and horses with a range of inherited diseases. The university hopes it will lead to the development of new treatments and the possible eradication of certain diseases, as well as enabling vets to advise pet owners on how to reduce the risk of their animals developing particular illnesses. The DNA will also be useful in human genetic research as many animal genes are similar to those of humans. The university described the archive as a major step forward in veterinary research. Professor John Innes, the head of small animal studies at Liverpool, said: \"Selective breeding of dogs, cats and horses has had the side-effect of concentrating certain genetic diseases in certain breeds. \"With the canine genome map almost complete, we will now be able, with the help of this archive, to start to identify genes associated with such diseases. This should help us reduce the prevalence of inherited diseases in the nation's companion animals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
