He hardly seemed to notice when a guard wearing a ski mask entered the hallway, eyeing L\u00f3pez as he reached for the keys on his belt. Moments later, the masked guard stepped aside from a heavy sliding door as a group of men in T-shirts and shorts burst in, one of them firing a handgun at L\u00f3pez. A second man drew a long knife, hacking at the fallen trafficker before the gunman drew a second weapon and emptied another cartridge of bullets. Within hours of the 26 October murder, footage of the brazen attack had leaked on to social media, sending a shockwave of fear through the nation. The killing came just days after evidence seized from L\u00f3pez helped a New York jury convict a former Honduran politician named Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez on four counts of drug trafficking and related weapons charges. Tony Hern\u00e1ndez is the brother of Honduras\u2019s current president, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez \u2013 and Lopez\u2019s lawyer was quick to accuse the government of complicity in his client\u2019s murder. \u201cJuan Orlando [Hern\u00e1ndez] silenced him,\u201d said L\u00f3pez\u2019s lawyer, Carlos Chajtur. \u201cThat door opened on purpose.\u201d The murder is the latest embarrassment for the US state department, which continues to ignore the haze of allegations around the Honduran government while pushing the country to cooperate in Donald Trump\u2019s regional crackdown on migration. A week before the trial began, the two countries announced an agreement, allowing the US to send asylum seekers from third countries to the violence-torn Central American nation while their claim is processed. Similar deals have been drawn up with Guatemala and El Salvador. So, while US prosecutors in New York described a situation of \u201cstate-sponsored drug trafficking\u201d, the state department has maintained a business-as-usual approach following Tony Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s conviction. A day after the verdict, the top US diplomat in Honduras was photographed smiling with President Hern\u00e1ndez at a military parade. The Honduran president also featured in the New York case, when prosecutors accused him of having received millions of dollars from drug traffickers, including a $1m bribe from Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. Prosecutors accused Tony Hern\u00e1ndez of conspiring to murder rival traffickers, including a massacre with a bazooka and machine guns that resulted in four deaths. President Hern\u00e1ndez, who was re-elected in a fraud-marred vote in 2017 after the supreme court lifted a single-term limit, has denied all accusations of links to drug trafficking and maintained his brother\u2019s innocence. \u201cWhat can you say about a conviction based on the testimonies of confessed murderers?\u201d he said on Twitter after the verdict was announced. Opposition leaders have called for President Hern\u00e1ndez to resign, but fear, division and a dearth of leadership have prevented sporadic protests from coalescing into a mass movement. At the time of his capture in June 2018, L\u00f3pez was living under an assumed name, after faking his own death a few years earlier by paying bribes to obtain a falsified death certificate and a new identity. He was considered one of the largest drug traffickers in Honduras, so anti-narcotics agents were intrigued to discover hundreds of pages of records itemizing his business welded in a secret compartment in a vehicle seized in the arrest. One of those agents testified at the trial of Tony Hern\u00e1ndez that he had immediately spotted the former legislator\u2019s name in the ledgers, which also list payments to a person identified as \u201cJOH\u201d \u2013 the initials by which President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez is commonly known. The Honduran government announced it is investigating the murder of Lop\u00e9z and has suggested an alternative motive. Deputy security secretary Luis Suazo suggested on Twitter that other traffickers may have had L\u00f3pez killed because he was prepared to testify that the ledgers used in the New York trial were fake. Critics argue that L\u00f3pez was murdered to avoid any possibility that he might someday testify in a US court \u2013 and to send a message to others who might do the same. \u201cThe first message is for those who are linked to drug trafficking in Honduras to show them that they or their family members will be murdered if they continue providing evidence,\u201d said Dr Joaqu\u00edn Mej\u00eda, a human rights lawyer who has studied violence in Honduras."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
