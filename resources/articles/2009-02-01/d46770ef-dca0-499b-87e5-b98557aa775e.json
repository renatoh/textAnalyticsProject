I speak of Manny Ramirez, the dreadlocked 12-time All Star and daffy outfielder whose oddball moments have led to a new phrase in the baseball lexicon: \"Manny being Manny.\" At first blush, the fact that Ramirez is yet to own the third spot in some team's batting order borders on the surreal. He has played 16 seasons in his career with Cleveland, Boston and Los Angeles. In that time, he has averaged 41 home runs and 133 RBI per 162-game season. Even more impressively, his teams win. His seven seasons in Cleveland saw five division titles and two trips to the World Series. In Boston, Manny famously was the best slugger on the team that finally ended its Shakespearean struggle with futility and heartbreak, cracking through to win the 2004 World Series and adding a second championship in 2007. Last season, upon being traded to Los Angeles, Manny single-handedly carried a punchless crew to the playoffs, including a sweep of favoured Chicago, before losing to the eventual champs, Philadelphia. Hard to blame Manny \u2013 he only went 13 for 25 with four homers and 10 ribbies in the postseason. Equally important in Hollywood, he brought some much-needed star power to the Dodgers. Baseball is popular in LaLa Land in exact proportion to the big-time performers on display \u2013 otherwise, the fans can star-watch at any corner or restaurant without battling as much traffic. Manny put asses in the seats at Chavez Ravine and became the Dodgers' first legitimate Hispanic superstar since pitcher Fernando Valenzuela took Southern California by storm in the early 1980s. So resigning with the Dodgers, or perhaps the cross-town Angels, would be a no-brainer, si? Well, no. Part of the reason Manny remains homeless is his age (38) and his salary demands (roughly $25m per season, with three guaranteed years \u2013 a lot of coin to give to someone that old, particularly in this crushing economic climate). That's a tough combination to swallow for any general manager, but in terms of pure on-field performance, it's hard to believe it wouldn't be money well spent. Ramirez is often mocked for being a baseball savant, someone who has incredible ability married to a bizarre child-like personality. He has had myriad incidents on and off the field in his career that defy easy explanation, building a case that Manny may not be sure exactly what is going on around him. They are carefully noted and catalogued by Manny-watchers: the time he disappeared into a door in the famous Green Monster during a game in Boston; the inexplicable lunging cutoff of a throw made 20 or so feet away, allowing a runner to score easily; the auctioning off of a sports car and grill while he was meant to be with the team; and many more. But baseball history is littered with oddballs and offbeat personalities, few of whom could rake like Manny. It defies belief that his apparent Asperger's Syndrome would keep teams from acquiring his bat. So there must be more to the story. There is. Ramirez wanted to stay in Boston, but the Sox were balking about extending his contract to his desired length, given his age and ability to create negative headlines in baseball-obsessed Beantown. Manny, at the apparent behest of his agent and \u00fcber-puppet master, Scott Boras, pulled a vanishing act for the ages on his team, playing half-heartedly, complaining of phantom injuries, fighting with teammates in the dugout, getting into an altercation with an aging team official and endlessly expressing his utmost desire to leave the team forthwith. His wishes were granted when Boston finally sent him to LA in a three-team deal. But the entire affair left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. Manny took much of the rap, while those who knew more details blamed Boras and the Sox as well. Regardless of who is ultimately the guiltiest party in the affair, the blowback is now being felt. Were it any other player with Manny's statistical portfolio, he'd be finalising plans for a trip to spring training in Florida or Arizona as we speak. Instead, Manny waits by the phone, bat in hand. While Rodriguez will get to play this season despite his steroidal transgressions, it remains to be seen if Ramirez will overcome his behavioural ones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
