The food retailer estimates that its 4.6 million members have built up points worth \u00a330m by earning a reward of 5% every time they buy a Co-op brand or service. It is now encouraging them to donate these points to its new coronavirus fund. Steve Murrells, Co-op\u2019s chief executive, has promised to top up the fund by donating 20% of his salary for the next three months to help support food banks, a funeral hardship fund and other frontline community causes. The Co-Op paid Murrells an annual salary of \u00a3869,000 in 2018, excluding bonus pay. \u201cMillions of people are suffering financial hardship at the moment and so it felt right for me to offer to take this pay cut and directly support causes which are very important to me and close to my heart,\u201d Murrells said. The retailer said members could now visit their online \u201cwallet\u201d on the Co-Op website and choose to donate the reward points to the Co-Op members\u2019 coronavirus fund. The donations will be used initially to support food banks and a funeral bereavement fund, as well as other local causes that are helping to alleviate the impact of the coronavirus lockdown. The plan to kickstart a new coronavirus fund comes one week after the ethical food retailer scrapped its Easter TV advertising campaign to donate the airtime \u2013 worth \u00a32.5m \u2013 to promoting FareShare, a food bank charity. The retailer has also created an extra 5,000 jobs in its stores to cope with increased demand, and is offering temporary employment contracts to hospitality workers who have lost their jobs due to the downturn. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 April 2020 to clarify details of Steve Murrells\u2019 personal donation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
