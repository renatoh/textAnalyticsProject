In the end, all eyes will be on a handful of low-polling minor parties that could wield influence well beyond their size and ultimately determine the outcome. Ardern\u2019s Labour and the centre-right opposition National party are both currently polling around 40-45%. If we in New Zealand had a first-past-the-post election system, the largest party would be likely to win a majority of seats, delivering a single-party government (even without necessarily winning more than 50% of the vote).But under proportional representation, it\u2019s not enough for either party to form a government. Both will need friends in parliament. Currently, the minor parties have very low levels of support and may not survive beyond the next election. In recent times, New Zealanders have shied away from supporting these minnows. In fact, since the introduction of the mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system in 1996, every single minor party that has been in government has subsequently been punished with a worse election result. Survival is complicated by a threshold in the MMP system. To get into parliament, parties need to either reach 5% of the national vote or win an electorate seat. For example, if a party wins 10% of the national vote, it would win about 10% of the seats. A party is exempt from needing to reach the 5% national threshold it wins an electorate seat outright. That means a party that won a seat but only got 2% of the vote nationally, would still end up with 2% of the MPs. The two most important parties for Ardern\u2019s survival are the current coalition partners, the Greens (currently with 6-7% support in opinion polls) and the nationalist New Zealand First (3-4% support). But there are no guarantees the Greens will make it over 5%. At times during the past two years they have dropped below that in opinion polls. And at the last election, a scandal involving one of its co-leaders admitting to benefit fraud saw its support levels plummet overnight. On current polling, Winston Peters\u2019 New Zealand First would be out of parliament. Although many expect their support will pick up in election year, it\u2019s far from certain, and they have dropped below 5% in two elections before, both times after periods in government. NZ First might have a chance of winning the seat of Northland. There is speculation the party\u2019s outspoken MP and cabinet minister Shane Jones \u2013 a likely replacement for Peters when he eventually leaves politics \u2013 could take the seat off the main opposition National party, especially if Labour agrees to only run a soft campaign against him. However, even if NZ First is returned, there\u2019s no reason to assume they will necessarily support Ardern for PM. In 2017 they surprised many in choosing Labour to govern, but if they are post-election \u201ckingmakers\u201d again in 2020, they are theoretically able to swing either way, making the outcome hard to predict. The National party, with its lacklustre leader, Simon Bridges, is in a very uncertain position. They desperately need parliamentary allies, and NZ First doesn\u2019t appear that friendly at the moment. The Greens are essentially tied to Labour. National does have the rightwing Act party with one MP, but that\u2019s only thanks to an understanding that National won\u2019t fully campaign for their seat. Act has been edging up in recent polls and could bring in another MP. Bridges is suggesting that other minor parties might emerge to act as coalition partners. The possibility of a new Christian-based party making the 5% threshold or winning an electorate seat would be miraculous. However, Bridges knows that his best chance is not making new friends in parliament, but rather taking out Ardern\u2019s current support parties. It\u2019s a cunning, if very cynical plan. A number of new \u201cmicro parties\u201d will be attempting to make it into parliament in 2020. They have little chance of success, but they do have the potential to have a big impact. Two small environmentally-focused parties \u2013 Sustainable NZ and the Opportunities party \u2013 could end up acting as spoilers, stealing votes from the Greens and sinking them under the crucial 5% threshold. It\u2019s a ridiculous situation. The arbitrary 5% threshold can see parties destroyed because they get 4.9% and their supporters\u2019 votes are wasted, while major-party manipulation with electorate deals sees parties elected with less than 1% support \u2013 as is the case with National\u2019s sweetheart deal with the Act party. This has all sorts of implications. Not only does it mean new parties struggle to get consideration \u2013 as it\u2019s very hard to build up a party when the public fears a \u201cwasted vote\u201d \u2013 but it also means that a few small shifts of support for the minor parties will have a big impact on who might govern. And the biggest impact could be from parties with minuscule support \u2013 for example, the Act party on 1-2%, but who could win a seat outright, or the potential spoiler effects of the new environmental parties. So, in 2020, the minor parties are the ones to watch. They will determine if Jacinda Ardern gets a second term. Ardern will continue to wipe the floor with Bridges when it comes to personal popularity. But this will count for nothing if she hasn\u2019t got enough coalition friends.
