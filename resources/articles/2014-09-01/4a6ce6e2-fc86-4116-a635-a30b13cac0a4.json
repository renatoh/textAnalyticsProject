Ruffalo made the plea in a press call hosted by Food &amp; Water Watch, which released a report on Tuesday tying the controversial practice of fracking to climate change. The report comes days ahead of next week\u2019s UN climate summit in New York. \u201cBy stopping this fracking, it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to go backwards \u2013 we don\u2019t have to take an economic hit or lose jobs,\u201d Ruffalo said. \u201cIt means moving forward with clean energy, the power of the 21st century.\u201d Food &amp; Water Watch\u2019s report summarizes recent findings about the environmental and social impact of fracking. It also condemned the relationship between the US government and oil and gas industry: \u201cThis creates an inertia that imperils current and future generations, and endangers our economy, as we face the consequences of global warming and the legacy of the industry\u2019s pollution\u201d It also warns of the effects of unregulated disposal of waste caused by fracking, the pollutants pumped into the air during the fracking process and its effect on local communities. Dr Sandra Steingraber, a science advisor for the organization, said \u201cmethane is the new carbon dioxide,\u201d because of the potent greenhouse gas\u2019 impact on the atmosphere. On Monday, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that the natural gas boom has contaminated water in Texas and Pennsylvania, though it was careful to distinguish the cause as a result of defective gas well production, not directly a result of fracking. \u201cEverything that comes before fracking and everything that comes after fracking is an opportunity for methane to be emitted into the atmosphere as a potent greenhouse gas,\u201d said Dr Tony Ingraffea, scientist and engineer at Cornell University. Ingraffea said that the group considers fracking to be everything from the bulldozer that first clears land for drilling until the extracted methane is eventually used. \u201cEverything that comes before fracking and everything that comes after fracking is an opportunity for methane to be emitted into the atmosphere as a potent greenhouse gas,\u201d Ingraffea said. The group joined other scientists and activists to launch the #DontFrackOurClimate social campaign, which is timed ahead of the People\u2019s Climate March on Sunday, which is meant to draw politicians\u2019 attention to climate change ahead of the UN summit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
