Suppose you are a digital \"virgin\" from south London and decide to take the plunge, by paying a flat \u00a3150 installation fee. From that point BSkyB will have your address and phone number. It will start to get to know you. Come Christmas, the very efficient Sky call centres, located within the UK, not India, may well give you a bell, to tempt you to try a special pay offer. Blockbusters for the season or perhaps Crystal Palace's promotion to the premiership will generate great excitement. A letter to selected post codes ahead of a key match might do the trick. It can also use the platform, more simply, to market the pay goodies to you. Sky's conversion to free-to-air is a hard-headed business decision. And although the development is pleasing to both Ofcom and the government as they plot the switch-over to digital, it hasn't been taken for political reasons. There is no sign, for example, that BSkyB has revived plans for the once mooted general entertainment channel, Channel 6, to drive take-up. Nor is it up for purchasing Channel Five, now cautiously flirting with Channel 4. Sky One and wall-to-wall Simpsons are not being put on to the free service - so far only Sky News and Sky interactive are confirmed. And within the \u00a3150 deal it is not making expansive promises and is only guaranteeing to pay for the initial card, not subsequent upgrades. That's why the shares were initially marked up. The City has got the message that the pay business remains the focus and is what sets the Murdoch senior and junior hearts beating. The targets for average revenue per user (Arpu) are not being abandoned but nor will they be the only measure of success - the ruse is that \"free\" households don't count, so they'll be run in parallel, until they are sucked into the pay family and affect the Arpu calculation. What has happened is that the company has formally switched from one size fits all to different offerings to tempt different folks, at different price and service points. That's essential for a ubiquitous, maturing service. James Murdoch promised as much back in March. It's also why it is the first UK broadcaster, influenced by America, to commit to introducing high definition television broadcasts, from 2006, which will make a significant impact on the quality of reception on huge plasma screens. Again, when marketed alongside Sky Plus, this will prove its superiority over digital terrestrial television, which has no such HD option. So why is it bothering? The obvious answer is that the company is clearly rattled by the success of Freeview - 3.5m homes in 21 months. It is eyeing up all the rest before too many more are lost, not just the 27% outside of Freeview's signals, but the 47% who are stubbornly happy with analogue broadcasting, or too broke to change. It is banking on the undeniably superior Sky equipment working its magic, with interactivity provided by the back channel operated through the phone line. Sky's own research has predicted there will be a satisfactory conversion level to pay. The wooing to switch to subscription may not come at once, in fact it probably makes good sense to let a few months elapse, so a new customer becomes acquainted with the digital world, the delights of nearly 200 channels as opposed to 24 from Freeview, and the useful information on up and coming programmes supplied via the electronic programme guide (epg). But there is a downside. At \u00a3150 to connect, it is quite an expensive option, at worst three times more than Freeview. It may not be that popular. Sky is not, at this stage, being as ruthless as it might be. But, worst of all, even with a basic service, padded out with shopping channels, it also runs the risk of tempting more miserly or cash-strapped existing subscribers to downgrade, to go to the free option, especially if interest rate rises start to bite. Again, Sky's marketeers will have their work cut out to plug any breaches. But finally, remember that each Sky epg comes with the red button. Sky interactive allows access to other services, such as BBCi and voting for Big Brother. This is a barely developed secondary revenue spinner in its own right, yet it could be the means of generating micro payments, like mobile phones. And there is also direct response and interactive advertising, where a viewer clicks through and asks for more information or exposure to a product. This has been stifled so far because of the dual costs of using the system and paying to access to BSkyB's data bank of names and addresses, which is essential to following through a request. That is bound to change. In other words, even if a significant proportion of homes stay with free-to-air satellite, and refuse to upgrade, there are still ways for BSkyB to make money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
