Mr Chisholm was also being charged with several counts of involuntary wounding. French prosecutor Jean-Pierre Alacchi said he would bring the charges at 6pm. Mr Alacchi said he did not believe Mr Chisholm, 31, from Edinburgh, had fallen asleep at the wheel, but had swerved after \"realising at the last minute\" that he was on the wrong road. Meanwhile survivors of the coach crash, in which nine other people were seriously injured, today returned to Scotland for an emotional reunion with their families. A plane carrying 31 pupils and two teachers who were on the school trip arrived at Glasgow Airport at 2.45am, nearly 24-hours after the accident. Katherine, from Largs, died, and six other pupils and three teachers from Largs Academy, North Ayrshire, were seriously hurt when their bus overturned on a sliproad near Dijon, central France. One of the teachers lost his arm in the accident and six pupils and two other teachers are still in a \"serious\" condition in hospital in France. The accident happened early yesterday as the coach carrying 51 people rounded a bend while heading down a sliproad on the A6 at the junction for Bierre-les-Semur. No other vehicle was thought to be involved. Speaking after their arrival, Alasdair Herbert, assistant chief executive of North Ayrshire Council, told waiting reporters: \"They are tired, tearful, and relieved to be back home and reunited with their families.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
