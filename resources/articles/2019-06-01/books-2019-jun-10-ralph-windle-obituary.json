His alter ego, a wise and seemingly omniscient sheep named Bertie Ramsbottom, was one of Ralph\u2019s creative triumphs, whose satirical but hopeful poetry enabled him to expound on a wide range of sociopolitical and business issues, appearing in the Financial Times, Harvard Business Review and elsewhere. Born in Sheffield, Ralph came from a proudly working-class family and took inspiration from his radical parents. His father, Horace, was a union official who fought fascism in the Spanish civil war, and his mother, Nellie (nee Foster), was a tribunal magistrate. He won a scholarship to King Edward VII school in the city, then, following national service, went on to study classics at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating in 1953. He was recruited on to the marketing training programme at Procter &amp; Gamble and, after rising to product group manager there, in the 1960s went to Nabisco, where he became chief executive and main board director of the UK division, as well as being a member of the Nabisco European management council. After Nabisco, Ralph worked as a consultant in business strategy. From 1969, as a founding fellow of the all-graduate Templeton College, he brought a wealth of expertise to the Oxford Centre for Management Studies, where he stayed until 1980. The first published collection of work as Bertie Ramsbottom, Boardroom Ballads, appeared in 1982, after the poems were serialised in the FT that year. With this persona, through books, radio and live performance, Ralph brought poetry into corporate boardrooms and offices. He continued to exercise various visiting professor and research roles in Europe and the Americas, in particular at the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Phoenix, Arizona. Ralph acted as external adviser to four successive directors general of the National Economic Development Office in the 70s and on projects with the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the European commission, Georgetown Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Washington DC, and the International Labour Organization in Geneva. A prolific Guardian letter writer, he was like a ram with two tails when the Observer published his \u201cStopping the Tory zombies\u201d letter on his 87th birthday last year. He was my close friend for more than 30 years and partner for the last six. He is survived by me, by his children Marcus, Nicholas, Jude and Stephanie, from his first marriage, to Ina Onion, which ended in divorce, and Justin and Christina, from his second marriage, to Ariana Clarke, who died in 2004, by three grandchildren and a great-grandchild."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
