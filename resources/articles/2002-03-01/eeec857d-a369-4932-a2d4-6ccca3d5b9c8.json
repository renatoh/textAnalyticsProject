Despite his 6-4, 6-4 win over the big-serving Max Mirnyi, which earned a quarter-final place in the Dubai Open, Henman was never really in control and often quite irritated, both during the match and after. How he deals with this today may determine how he fares against the Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson, a member of Sweden's victorious Davis Cup team against Great Britain recently. \"I was struggling,\" Henman admitted and, when encouraged to explain why, allowed the list of reasons to grow. The balls \"weren't very fast,\" the wind was \"swirly and difficult\" and the staccato rhythm of the hit-or-bust Mirnyi was \"even more difficult\". But, Henman said, there was also himself. Or rather, he was not himself; he was jaded after a late arrival from Rotterdam and was playing in a different climate. However, Henman has been mauled often enough by commentators to have learned a trick or two and he was not going to be manoeuvred into getting down on himself. \"You play with the cards on the table,\" he insisted. \"It's a question of how you respond. Sometimes you get frustrated but sometimes you keep calm. And I am doing the latter.\" Mostly this was true, though there was some grumbling at a line judge about a decision, even though it went in his favour, and a glare at a dove that landed in the tramlines and then pursued its mate in a series of amorous swoops across the stadium. At this stage, early in the second set, Henman had to get out of trouble. He saved four break points, then two more. But, after capturing the Belarussian's serve, he allowed Mirnyi to break back. By then the sun had descended. In the lengthening shadows Mirnyi self-destructed with a couple of wayward volleys and Henman won the last two games . Switzerland's Roger Federer may face a fine after the sixth seed gave a surprisingly limp display in a 6-3, 6-1 defeat to Germany's Rainer Schuttler. \"I thought he played well below our expectations,\" said the tournament referee Jeff Chapman, who added that he had discussed the matter with the Association of Tennis Professionals. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
