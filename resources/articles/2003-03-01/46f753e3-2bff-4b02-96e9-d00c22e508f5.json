Travel companies that have reduced the number of trips on sale now because of a lack of demand say the result of a quick war could be a lack of holidays to go round. Last week, holiday giant First Choice said it would cut capacity in May and June 'across the board' by 15 per cent. It said tanks around Heathrow, grenades arriving through Gatwick, and the build-up to war in Iraq resulted in bookings being 25 per cent down in the last month. Airtours and Thomson, along with many other travel companies, said they were 'reviewing capacity', meaning that more cuts are likely to be announced soon. With the war drums causing bookings to eastern Mediterranean destinations to tumble, Keith Betton, head of corporate affairs at the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said: 'I think waiting for holiday prices to fall is like watching the stock market. If everyone waits until July and August, companies will cut capacity rather than price, so it's not a particularly smart move to wait until the last minute.' There are bargains currently on offer for travel in early summer, particularly to countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Cyprus and Greece, which are suffering as war pressure mounts. For example, Thomson is offering seven nights in Cyprus for \u00a3199, reduced 52 per cent from \u00a3415, departing 9 May. However, travel companies say cut prices are unlikely to continue into the peak summer season. After the 1991 Gulf War, capacity cuts and the collapse of the International Leisure Group meant holidaymakers who had expected bargains found they often had to pay the full price. 'In 1991, from the end of June onwards, everything sold out at full price and there was a lack of rooms,' said Dudley der Parthog, director of Sunvil Holidays. 'This year, there will be bargains to be had in May and June but not particularly after that.' According to der Parthog, companies have cancelled half the beds they had to sell on the Greek island of Cephalonia. He added that should there be a swift end to any conflict, it would not always be possible to add capacity at the last minute if the number of holidays on sale had been cut. Research from Teletext Holidays said that while a third of holidaymakers are leaving booking 'as late as possible to snap up bargains', a significant proportion were booking holidays early to destinations perceived as 'safe' for fear that holidays would disappear. The survey showed that Australia, Spain, Portugal and France were seen as the safest four destinations, with Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia and Malaysia viewed as least safe. Betton said: 'It certainly was the experience in 1991 that western Mediterranean destinations filled up really quickly and they're bound to be popular again.' \u00b7 As a result of incorrect information supplied to us, last week's Escape listed the carnival in Cologne as an Easter family activity. This year's carnival has in fact already taken place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
