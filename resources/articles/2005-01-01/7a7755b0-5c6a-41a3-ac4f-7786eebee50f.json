Onwards it ran through the MallerstangValley and via the Eden Valley and the great Border City to the Solway Firth. The Environment Agency graded the floods it caused as a \"once-in-200-years event\". Yesterday I tried reaching its source on Black Fell Moss before a blizzard drove me back. There was much to take in. Mallerstang is where the moorland scenes of An American Werewolf in London were filmed. Hellgill is a limestone gorge so narrow that Dick Turpin is said to have leaped across it on horseback. Downstream, below emerald pastures, Hellgill Force plunges over a shelf into a pool 70ft below. Between these spectacles crosses the ancient highway named after Lady Anne Clifford, a redoubtable woman who defied King James I and Oliver Cromwell. She travelled between her castles by carriage along this ledge, several hundred feet above the valley. Across the valley a train on the Settle Carlisle Railway - reaching almost 1,200ft - looked suspended in midair as it crossed the fellside. Above it loomed Wild Boar Fell with its breathtaking views of the summits of Lakeland and the Howgills one way, and the vast rolling moorlands of the Yorkshire Dales the other. Before I realised, I had reached the Water Cut, a substantial limestone sculpture by Mary Bourne, shaped like a tombstone split in two by a serpentine space representing the river. By taking a step back you can see through this slot the Eden far below, one of the few large rivers in England that flows northwards - recently to such disastrous effect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
