That \"connection\" between the pro game and the amateur game also lies at the root of golf's appeal. How do I know this? Because the people who run the game, and the people who manufacture golf equipment, have been saying so for years. These people have also been vocal opponents of something called \"bifurcation\" - whereby the pros play under a different set of rules from that that apply to amateurs. Others, including the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Greg Norman, have called for bifurcation with the respect to the golf ball. If the pros played a golf ball that didn't go as far as the one available in the shops then people would not be forced into doing silly things with our great golf courses, like growing rough at Augusta and building the tee on the Road Hole at the Old Course in the next door driving range. Among those who have eloquently put the case against bifurcation has been Wally Uilhein, chairman and CEO of the equipment manufacturer, Titleist, and he did so in this interview published on the company's website, saying: We have never supported the position of bifurcation. Playing by one set of rules, playing the same game, playing the same course and playing the same equipment is what makes golf different. It is the essence of the game. Two sets of rules involving the golf ball, or the golf ball and golf clubs, would result in 1) the longer players on Tour only getting longer in comparison to those who are less long, and 2) the opening of a Pandora's box with regard to the regulation of equipment at the local, state, sectional and national levels. Golf is not so cleanly a professional game and an amateur game. That is the great thing about golf. That is why our national championship is an Open Championship administered by the USGA. Bifurcation is only seriously advanced by those who think that the game is on some edge of ruination and who thus, as a result of their narrow and biased thinking, feel some form of radical surgery is required. How strange it was , then, to click on to golf.com today to find it reported that Titleist has made two new version of its most popular ball, the Pro-V1, that will only be available to tour players. Since last August, Titleist has made two tour-only versions of the Pro V1 ball available to PGA Tour players. The Pro V1 Plus Spin is marked with a \"s----PRO V1---s\" on the seam while the Pro V1x Plus Trajectory has a \"+---PRO V1x---\" on its seam. According to a Titleist tour rep, \"These products are customized versions of 2009 Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls that have been designed to optimize performance for a small handful of PGA Tour players.\" So far, so normal. Tour players often play with balls that are not yet available to the public - although they soon will be. Not this time, however. Golf.com continues: The tour rep also wrote in bold, \"These products are not in response to nor designed to address new groove rules and they are not planned to be sold commercially.\" Obviously these two balls have been approved under existing rules but they are something new and different; they have been designed for the pros, will be played only by the pros and they will never be sold commercially to the paying punter. Isn't that some form of bifurcation?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
