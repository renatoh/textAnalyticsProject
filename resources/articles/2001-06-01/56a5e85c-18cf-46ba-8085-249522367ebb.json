A study by the Consumers' Association showed that, at a potential cost of \u00a360 for a fortnight, using the right amount of sunscreen could end up burning a hole in people's pockets. Yet by using supermarket's own brands, the same results could be achieved for less money. Sunscreens from Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury and Safeway all lived up to their labels. Applying the supermarket creams properly, said researchers, holidaymakers would have to spend \u00a331.44 to protect themselves during a two-week holiday in the sun. That compared with \u00a344.28 for Superdrug's Solait cream, \u00a352.27 for Boots' Soltan and up to \u00a363 for Ambre Solaire, although shopping around could bring the total cost of using the latter down to just over \u00a340. \"Our research found that practising safe sun needn't burn a hole in your pocket,\" says Helen Parker, editor of Which? magazine. \"By buying discounted branded sunscreens and reputable own labels the cost of holiday sun protection can be halved.\" The association said its findings had come after testing the creams on human guinea pigs in 20,000 trials under sun lamps. But it also warned consumers to be on their guard - with one cut-price cream for children offering less than half the protection promised on the bottle. National budget chain Poundland said it had withdrawn stocks of its US-made Sea &amp; Ski range after one of the factor 30 creams for children, costing \u00a31 for 180ml, was found to only offer factor-12 protection. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) found on most bottles of sunscreen indicates how much UVB radiation a product blocks out - the main cause of sunburn, premature ageing and skin cancer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
