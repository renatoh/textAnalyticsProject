But these are unusual times. So April\u2019s column will be published next week. I thought, instead, to explore the comfort and healing I find in gardening, whether it is digging a trench for potatoes on the plot or tending a rose in a pot on the terrace. From the first time I grew flower seed I knew it would become part of my life. My first job in London was in a plant nursery (I used to stock neighbours\u2019 gardens from discarded plants my new bosses threw in the skip.) My next stop was an eco-commune in Anglesey growing organic vegetables by the Irish sea. But then, I guess, parenting and journalism intervened. Our first planting of the roof terrace here in north London was a cascade of clematis and clambering rose, though it has since calmed down. But it was at Plot 29 after my brother died that I found my solace in soil. In simply tending seedlings, like I had wanted to care for my sisters and Christopher. Here I found nurture in nature. Peace of mind in growing childhood flowers, radishes and peas. Over these anxious weeks I\u2019ve been drawn to the plot. To salads sown to the rat-a-tat-tapping of the woodpecker, the call of the invisible owl, a robin bobbing for worms where I\u2019ve just broken ground. There are calendula growing from seed I save and sow every year. There are trays of French beans and painted mountain corn beginning to stir on the terrace, waiting for their place in the sun. All a promise for the future. Whether it\u2019s tending a potted plant, a window box, a flower patch or an allotment, I have found a comfort in caring. Allan Jenkins\u2019s Plot 29 (4th Estate, \u00a39.99) is out now. Order it for \u00a38.49 from guardianbookshop.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
