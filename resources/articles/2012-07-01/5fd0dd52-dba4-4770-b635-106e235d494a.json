Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! \u2013 review", "bodyText": "In the liner notes to this German-recorded reissue from 1980, free-jazz pianist Alex von Schlippenbach writes about when he first heard Cecil Taylor perform. \"Here I could breathe the air from another planet,\" he recalls. \"It may have been just like this when Beethoven improvised.\" From the late 50s, the unique African-American pianist conceived a unique fusion of jazz, 19th-century European Romantic music, and the rhythmic impulsiveness of modern dance, but spliced it all with such intensity that the provenance of the elements became barely recognisable. Taylor often played with ballet-dancers (Mikhail Baryshnikov being the most famous), and that artform is constantly evoked here by the flurries of notes punctuated by abrupt halts, tumbling abstract sounds briefly coloured by song-like figures or buoyed up by passing harmonies. For a percussive pianist, some of Taylor's lightly tripping runs are surprisingly dainty, and Ensaslayi and Corn in the Sun are full of jazz's melodic and rhythmic notions, albeit tightly compressed. This set might well be a way into Taylor's music for those who have stopped at the gate before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
