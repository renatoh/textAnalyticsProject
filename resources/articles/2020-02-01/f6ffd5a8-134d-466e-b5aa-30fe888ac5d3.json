Its idyllic location between coast, mountains and countryside means it can offer the perfect jumping-off point for a varied and action-packed 36 hours \u2013 with plenty of relaxing thrown in, too. In less than two days, it\u2019s easy to sample the best of the city \u2013 and the best of the nearby vineyards, mountains and glaciers, too. DAY 1 \u2013 Dine then wine 1pm: Lunch with the smart set Santiago\u2019s fine dining options are plentiful and excellent. The chef at 99 Restaurante, who has previously cooked at Denmark\u2019s famed Noma, blends local ingredients with international flair in six or nine-course tasting menus. Or visit Restaurante 040, where an El Bulli-trained chef serves up delicious degustations. Follow lunch with a sampling of the country\u2019s premium wines at the hyper-local La Vinocracia in \u00d1u\u00f1oa, the original Bocan\u00e1riz in Lastarria, or the mural-painted Barrica 94 in Bellavista, which all offer local wines by the glass in chic surroundings. Or delve into Chile\u2019s booming industry, craft beer, at Cervecer\u00eda Nacional in Barrio Yungay, where you can try more than 70 brews. 3pm: Retreat to the country Leave the city behind and within two hours, you\u2019ll arrive at the Colchagua Valley, the heart of Chile\u2019s wine-making industry. A place where vines have been grown for hundreds of years, it has a well-established wine route, with so many wineries that travellers often take several days to explore them all. At Las Ni\u00f1as vineyard, you can cycle around the vines and take a picnic to nibble beside the reservoir. Viu Manent offers horse-riding, and if you prefer sitting still, you can marvel at the swirling modern architecture of Vi\u00f1a Vik, in the neighbouring Millahue Valley, while sipping its produce. Staying out late? The organic Santa Cruz vineyard offers wine-tasting under the stars. 8pm: Dine in the vines Book in for dinner at the Clos Apalta winery, and you can indulge all you like in the free-flowing wine \u2013 it\u2019s only footsteps to your home for the night at the winery\u2019s Lapostolle Residence. There are just four villas, which are nestled into a hillside that overlooks the leafy vineyards and has far-reaching views to the Andes. Its fine-dining restaurant serves produce grown in its organic vegetable garden \u2013 and of course the award-winning wine is also produced on-site. Sleep soundly in the perfectly pared-back luxury of your villa, then refresh with a morning yoga class or a dip in the infinity pool. DAY 2 \u2013 Mountains and spas 10am: Hit the road to the Andes Only a few hours from the valley is the monumental Andes mountain range, with its pristine snow caps and dramatic gorges. Head for the Caj\u00f3n del Maipo, a spectacular canyon flanked by towering peaks, and stretch your legs a little. You can challenge yourself with the high-altitude trek up the El Morado Glacier (which reaches a lung-busting 5000m above sea level), or simply stroll amid waterfalls and alpine meadows. 1pm: Lunch in the mountains Picnic next to a glacial lake, or make tracks for Vi\u00f1a Santa Rita. The renowned vineyard makes award-winning wines, and offers bike tours with a picnic included. Stroll the estate\u2019s beautifully landscaped gardens, which have their own swan lake, explore the Museo Andino, which holds 3000 pre-Columbian artefacts, and dine amid classical colonnades and courtyards on produce grown within the grounds. You can even stay the night at the Hotel Casa Real, the pinnacle of 19th-century elegance. For a post-lunch treat, explore one of the valley\u2019s boutique biodynamic wineries. The resident Norwegian Fjord horses at Odfjell Vineyards are key to both viticulture and horseback tours of the vineyard, while Antiyal, the excellent boutique label of leading biodynamic wine consultant \u00c1lvaro Espinoza, is also a must-see. 3pm: Feel the adrenaline The R\u00edo Maipo, which rushes down from the glaciers in the high Andes and through the canyons and gorges all the way to Santiago, is a popular spot for whitewater rafting. If the thrill of Class III rapids isn\u2019t for you, the region\u2019s rolling alpine meadows and river valleys are also tailor-made for horse-riding. Trotting past the Cascadas de las Animas waterfall is an unforgettable experience. 6pm: Luxuriate in a hot-tub Soak away strains in rustic luxury at the Hotel Altiplanico Caj\u00f3n del Maipo. Its peaceful, pretty gardens hold a pool, complete with mountain views, a fire pit where staff will toast you marshmallows for that campfire feeling, and, of course, that hot tub, which looks out over the rushing R\u00edo Maipo. The hotel offers horse-riding, climbing, white-water rafting, hiking, glacier trekking, ziplining and mountain-biking, if you can spare an extra day to enjoy the region. And if just the thought of all that activity makes your muscles ache, book in for an on-site massage. 10pm: Sleep in rustic splendour After dinner at the hotel, retreat to a peaceful sleep in your chic and comfortable adobe room, listening to the sounds of the river and the birdsong, before returning to the city in the morning. From cosmopolitan capital Santiago, UNESCO world heritage sites and exploring planet\u2019s most pristine landscapes, Chile offers diverse activities for all travellers. Chile is Australia\u2019s gateway to South America, with 17 direct flights per week from Sydney and Melbourne. Visit chile.travel/en/ for more information."}, "isHosted": false}}}
