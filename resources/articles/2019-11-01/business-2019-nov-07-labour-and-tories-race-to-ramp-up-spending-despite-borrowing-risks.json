Sajid Javid, the chancellor, used a speech in Manchester to rip up Tory borrowing rules, saying he would spend as much as 3% of GDP on long-term projects, equivalent to roughly \u00a325bn more than current spending. As the election campaign turned to the economy, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used a speech in Liverpool to announce a \u00a3150bn social infrastructure fund. On Thursday, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility scrapped a plan to publish official figures for government borrowing, which were expected to show an increase in the budget deficit \u2013 the difference between government spending and income from taxes. What is the Labour transformation fund? McDonnell is planning a five-year, \u00a3150bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d on top of a \u00a3250bn \u201cgreen transformation fund\u201d to be spent over 10 years. Worth a combined \u00a3400bn, the funds will be controlled from a new Treasury office based in the north of England. The social fund would be for schools, hospitals, care homes and council houses, while the longer-term fund would be used for infrastructure spending on transport and energy, as part of the party\u2019s plans for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d. The money would be used to retrofit homes across the country, fund offshore wind projects and create a \u201cCrossrail for the north\u201d. What is Javid proposing? The chancellor said he would run a balanced current account budget \u2013 day-to-day government spending excluding infrastructure investment \u2013 by the middle of the next parliament. He also said borrowing for infrastructure would not exceed 3% of GDP, compared with a long-term average of 1.8%. \u201cIt means billions of pounds more to spend on the infrastructure revolution this country needs,\u201d Javid said. Capital spending has been reduced by the government since the financial crisis. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recommends developed nations spend about 3.5% of GDP a year on infrastructure. Labour\u2019s proposals would take current government investment spending from about \u00a347bn (2% of GDP) to at least \u00a3100bn a year (about 4% of GDP). How is it paid for? The spending plans from both parties would be paid for by additional borrowing. The government\u2019s budget deficit has fallen steadily over the past decade from a peak of \u00a3158bn in 2010 after the financial crisis to about \u00a323bn in the year to March 2019. Borrowing is expected to rise in future as spending commitments already put in place by the Conservatives kick in. GDP growth has also slowed, affecting tax receipts. What is the difference between Labour and the Tories? Both Labour and the Tories have signalled higher spending, without sufficient tax rises or spending cuts elsewhere to keep the deficit falling in future years. Whatever impact Brexit has on the economy would also have an effect on government finances. Both parties are yet to publish manifestos, making it difficult for analysts to say which will most increase spending and borrowing. Carys Roberts, the chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a leftwing thinktank, said the decision facing voters was about which party to trust to raise spending and borrowing. \u201cThe Tories are calling their plans the end of austerity, while also calling Labour fiscally irresponsible. They\u2019re treading a fine line there. Both are increasing their borrowing by quite some margin. From Labour, it\u2019s more about borrowing for investment, with the Conservatives, it\u2019s more on current spending and tax cuts,\u201d she said. What are the pros and cons of higher borrowing? Increasing investment to stimulate the economy is nothing new, particularly during times of economic turbulence. Franklin D Roosevelt, the then US president, used the New Deal in the 1930s to massively expand US spending on public works to pull the economy out of the Great Depression. One danger is the government could face higher interest payments on its debt. Britain pays about \u00a340bn a year to service a debt pile of about \u00a31.8tn (84% of GDP). Adding to that with higher annual deficits could make the country a more risky prospect for international investors, driving up borrowing costs. However, the cost of borrowing has fallen since the financial crisis to historical lows, as central banks cut interest rates around the world. Economists do not expect the trend to be dramatically reversed any time soon. Money spent on infrastructure should improve the performance of the economy in future, potentially making Labour\u2019s plans a sensible investment. However, economists say it could be unwise to spend as much as \u00a3150bn in as little as five years, given there are unlikely to be enough shovel-ready projects available, raising the risk the funds might be spent wastefully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
