When they emerged in the mid-1990s at the forefront of a movement unsatisfactorily dubbed \"post-rock\", they started to creep on to the radar of arts council-funded projects, particularly jazz bills. Their music has some of the superficial qualities of jazz \u2013 it is instrumental, rhythmically complex, harmonically rich and features the cool-school sound of the vibraphone \u2013 but Tortoise have always been more about texture than harmony; more about grooves than solos. Even their guitarist Jeff Parker, a formidable soloist with assorted Chicago jazz projects, never solos in Tortoise. Instead he uses his instrument to create bleepy riffs and rhythmic effects. Part of the appeal is watching these strange sounds being produced. If Tortoise can sound pleasantly snoozy on record, their music comes to life on stage, with the band multitasking on numerous instruments. The tracks from their most recent album Beacons of Ancestorship, which ditches the mallet instruments to explore proggier, techno-influenced territory, here take on a muscular air, with two drummers facing each other as they beat out tribal Afro-funk rhythms. The support act, the legendary electronica duo Cluster, were all about texture. Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius stood either side of a table, poking, stroking and twisting a baffling array of samplers and oscillators, constructing a symphony of dripping taps and Geiger counters. Some of the most compelling moments came when the 60-something Germans and the 40-something Chicagoans collaborated, with Cluster forcing Tortoise to rely rather more heavily on textural improvisation than proggier riffs. It's a direction that suited them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
