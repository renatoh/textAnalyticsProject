Klaus Kleinfeld, the chief executive of the German engineering group, said the economies of Europe were now so well integrated that political setbacks would not impede economic progress. \"Politically the current constitution crisis is unhelpful, but the foundation for Europe is a solid one,\" he said in an interview with the Guardian in Munich. \"And when you have time to digest these referendum votes and ask, how is this going to impact on what businesses in Europe are going to do, the answer is very little.\" Mr Kleinfeld said he watched the televised results of the French referendum in Budapest at a meeting of the European Round Table - an organisation of more than 40 of Europe's largest companies. \"The countries in Europe are now so entwined, and in such a sustainable way, that relations between them will not only continue but will continue to grow.\" In Germany, where Siemens is the second biggest company on the DAX index and employs 164,000 workers, a magazine poll published at the end of last week suggested 56% of Germans want to ditch the single currency, blaming it for the country's current economic malaise. However, Mr Kleinfeld said he was confident that anti-Europe sentiment would not halt labour market reforms begun by chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der - facing a general election in the autumn - to bring working practices in Europe's largest economy more into line with Britain and the United States. \"In Germany the politicians now understand that there is no other way to growth and job security than to be competitive on a global scale,\" Mr Kleinfeld said. \"The reforms that have been started are on the right track, and I'm sure that independent of which government we are going to have, they will continue.\" Last July, Siemens agreed a deal with 40,000 of its workers to extend their working hours but without pay increases. \"If you go to the sites that were affected by that deal, you wouldn't see or hear any opposition,\" Mr Kleinfeld said. \"Employees understand the importance of staying globally competitive.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
