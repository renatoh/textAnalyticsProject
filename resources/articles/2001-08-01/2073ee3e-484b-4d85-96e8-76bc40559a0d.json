Of the eight matches England have played in Germany, the 1938 one shortly before the outbreak of hostilities in the second world war was always destined to be the most notorious. The salute came at the behest of the British ambassador, Sir Neville Henderson, who told the then FA secretary Sir Stanley Rous that he always offered the salute in Hitler's presence and insisted: \"It carries no approval of anything his regime may do.\" Though unhappy about it, the England players followed orders, but at least they refused to show any courtesy on the field of play when, inspired by Stanley Matthews, they ran out 6-3 winners, the biggest margin of victory between the two countries. It was only the second encounter on German soil between the two countries, the first meeting in Berlin in May, 1930, having ended in a 3-3 draw. Despite the pessimism shrouding this Saturday's game in Munich, that was the beginning of what is a perfectly decent England record on German soil, where they have won three and drawn two of their eight matches. The Germans were forced to wait 38 years and five matches before they finally posted a victory at home. After the shame of 1938 England did not return to Berlin until 1956, when they were in one of their customary rebuilding modes after their destruction by Hungary three years earlier. And no player offered more hope for the future than Duncan Edwards, who was Michael Owen and Rio Ferdinand rolled into one. He beat several players before scoring a brilliant 27th-minute goal to inspire a 3-1 win. Another promising youngster Johnny Haynes also scored and Tommy Taylor, who was to perish with Edwards in the Munich air disaster two years later, led the line. In 1965, as the England manager Alf Ramsey was welding together the side that would win the World Cup, his team scored a 1-0 win in Nuremberg through a goal by Terry Paine, who missed out on the glory 12 months later. The Germans finally managed a home win in Hanover in 1968, an unconvincing 1-0 success against an England side using the match as a warm up for their European Champi onship clash with Yugoslavia four days later. And in May of 1972 the Germans were confident of paying back England for past Berlin humiliations. Two weeks earlier, thanks to imperious performances by Franz Beckenbauer and G\u00fcnter Netzer, the Germans had won 3-1 at Wembley in a European Championship match. And, gloomier than ever about a match on German soil, most people felt it would be a matter of trying to keep the score down in the second leg. Sadly Ramsey seemed to share that view, sending out a defensive formation that clawed out a goalless draw when England fans were desperate to see their players tilt at the German windmill. Ron Greenwood won plaudits from the press, remarkably even in Germany, after his team lost 2-1 to the reigning world champions in Munich in 1978, his first defeat as England manager. Ray Wilkins, then settling into the team, says: \"I remember us playing some really good football and smashing the Germans. But, as on so many occasions against them, we didn't have much luck.\" Stuart Pearson did get the rub of the goalpost when heading England ahead before half- time and it was not until the 80th minute that Worm equalised for Germany. Then, with five minutes to go, the Germans got the winner with a quickly taken free- kick. As England's players argued about where to line up, Rainer Bonhoff stepped up to take it and, as Wilkins recalls it: \"He mishit the ball and it wobbled round our wall and past Ray Clemence.\" In 1987, despite a Gary Lineker goal, England suffered a 3-1 defeat in D\u00fcsseldorf, their biggest on German soil. Coming two years after English clubs had been banned from Europe following the Heysel stadium disaster, the German people were more concerned about surviving the experience than the result of the match. German police used horses and dogs to break up fights between rival fans and caged English fans behind a specially built barricade inside the ground. Under the circumstances the arrest of only 30 England fans was a relief. Sadly, 14 years on, police will again be out in force to stop the predictable trouble between supporters. Most people think the outcome is just as inevitable, particularly those wearing German scarves. Beckenbauer, never a man short on confidence, says: \"England to win? When Germany are at home and only need a draw? Please.\" Overall statistics do not support his optimism, though the most telling one might be that England have not won in Germany since 1965.
