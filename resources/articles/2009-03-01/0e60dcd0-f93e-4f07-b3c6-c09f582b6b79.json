According to a filing in federal court today, the US justice department will only seek to detain individuals who provided \"substantial\" support for al-Qaida or the Taliban. It also acknowledges that president Barack Obama's authority to hold detainees is granted by an act of Congress and by international laws of war, rather than stemming from his power as commander in chief of the military. \"As we work towards developing a new policy to govern detainees, it is essential that we operate in a manner that strengthens our national security, is consistent with our values, and is governed by law,\" attorney general Eric Holder said in a statement. \"The change we've made today meets each of those standards and will make our nation stronger.\" Advocates for the detainees today said the new position is at best a modest departure from Bush policy, but is a public-relations effort to move away from the loaded term \"enemy combatants\" that critics across the world associate with the former president. The brief maintains the US government's ability to hold terrorist suspects without charge, said Tom Malinowski, Washington director of Human Rights Watch, and applies international laws of war to suspects captured far from the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. \"It's a symbolic effort to distance the new administration from the Bush approach,\" he said. \"But they've preserved significant aspects of the previous administration's detention authority.\" David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor who has written on Guant\u00e1namo Bay, said the crux of the administration's new standard for detention - \"substantial support\" - could still encompass many people who would not traditionally be subject to military detention as combatants. \"It's not a clear line,\" Cole said. \"I'm not sure that it marks a significant departure from the Bush administration approach.\" Josh Dratel, a New York attorney who represented Australian former Guant\u00e1namo prisoner David Hicks, said the move is \"a step in the right direction.\" \"It acknowledges that the president is not free to make up the rules as he goes along,\" he said, and acknowledges in court distinctions between classes of Guant\u00e1namo prisoners, some of whom did not offer \"substantial\" support for terrorist organisations. A spokeswoman for the Centre for Constitutional Rights, which has defended some of the detainees at Guant\u00e1namo, described the change as \"old wine in new bottles\". \"While the new government has abandoned the term 'enemy combatant', it appears on first reading that whatever they call those they claim the right to detain, they have adopted almost the same standard the Bush administration used to detain people without charge - with one change, the addition of the word 'substantially' before the word 'supported',\" said Jen Nessel. In one of his first acts as president, Obama ordered the prison at Guant\u00e1namo closed within the first year of his presidency and ordered a review of the status of the roughly 245 men still detained there. The review is underway now. Five of the men are the self-proclaimed masterminds of the September 11 attacks and have publicly boasted about their role in the attacks. They and others may eventually land in a criminal court in the United States. Others maintain they were merely Taliban footsoldiers or had only incidental contact with the militia, or less. The United States has cleared dozens for release and aims to transfer many of the inmates to other countries, including Britain. Last month Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian-born British resident, was released from Guant\u00e1namo and returned to Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
