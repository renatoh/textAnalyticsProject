He sparked the first innings onslaught at Edgbaston and conducted the roars of the crowd from first slip at Old Trafford. Hayden keeps trying to dominate - the only way he can prosper - but has yet to reach 50. He is lucky Australia do not have another opening bat in their squad. Trescothick: Up: Smashing Warne for a straight six at Edgbaston. Down: Becoming his 600th victim at Old Trafford. Hayden: Up: Usually survives the opening burst except when... Down: Driving Hoggard's first ball to a carefully placed short extra cover at Edgbaston. Andrew Strauss v Justin Langer - honours even Strauss has been troubled by Lee and tormented by Warne, but his century at Old Trafford shows that this cool customer is not daunted by either of them. Langer has been buffeted by Harmison and is reverting to his more dogged persona, for which the Aussies are grateful. Strauss: Up: Scoring runs against Warne at Old Trafford. Down: Being bowled by Warne when trying to pad up. Langer: Up: Grinding runs (by the standards of this series) at Edgbaston. Down: Learning the hard way that you can't take so many liberties against this England side by running himself out at Lord's. Michael Vaughan v Ricky Ponting - honours even Both have hit brilliant centuries. Both have survived intense scrutiny, Vaughan after the Lord's defeat, Ponting during the Old Trafford Test. Both are conducting this series in the best traditions of the game. But currently Ponting is under more pressure. He has been the one anxiously looking around the field for bowlers. Meanwhile, Vaughan has overseen a remarkable transformation since Lord's. Vaughan: Up: The Old Trafford century. Down: Looking back at a dishevelled off stump in the first two Tests. Ponting: Up: Batting the team out of trouble at Old Trafford. Down: Choosing to bowl and putting the team in trouble at Edgbaston. Ian Bell v Damien Martyn - honours even Amid the furious, technicolour exploits of this series here are a couple of anonymous craftsmen, so far only bit-players, possibly thanks to some duff decisions. Martyn looks in good form, but is not scoring many runs; Bell doesn't, but is starting to contribute. Bell, the rookie, has made the greatest advance. We now sense he is ready for the challenge. Bell: Up: A brilliant catch at short leg to dispatch Langer at Old Trafford. Down: Humiliation at the hands of Warne at Lord's. Martyn: Up: A brilliant catch to dispatch Pietersen at Lord's. Down: The sight of umpire Bucknor's finger at Old Trafford after edging on to his pads. Kevin Pietersen v Michael Clarke - advantage England After two Tests Pietersen was already part of the furniture, revelling in the frenetic atmosphere. He faltered at Old Trafford. Clarke has looked as classy as anyone but has been prone to youthful/arrogant aberrations. One has dodgy hands, the other a dodgy back. The Aussies would miss Clarke if the back remains troublesome. He is ripe for runs. Pietersen: Up: A stunning, nerveless debut. Down: The inability to catch any of the five chances that have come his way. Clarke: Up: Hitting 91 at Lord's. Down: Spurning the chance to convert that innings into a Test century. Andrew Flintoff v Simon Katich - advantage England Katich shaded the first Test, but I think Freddie has had him covered since then. Flintoff has tormented all the Australian left-handers, Katich included, with his pace and reverse swing. The Australian's place is in jeopardy, while Flintoff is not only England's best bowler, he has become our national sporting hero. Flintoff: Up: Where do we start? His butchery at Edgbaston; that over to Ponting; sustained hostility at Old Trafford. Down: Not being on the winning side after his valiant efforts on his home ground. Katich: Up: Runs at Lord's. Down: Shouldering arms at Old Trafford. Geraint Jones v Adam Gilchrist - honours even There has been surprisingly little to choose between them - although this is because Gilchrist has looked distinctly mortal with gloves and bat. The pundits were dropping Jones after the Saturday of the Old Trafford Test, but his excellence on Sunday and Monday revealed a resilient character. Gilchrist is undroppable - because he's Gilchrist. Jones: Up: Catching Warne by reacting so fast to the ricochet from Strauss's knee on Monday evening. Down: Dropping Warne on Sat evening at Old Trafford. Gilchrist: Up: When not facing Flintoff. Down: When facing Flintoff. Ashley Giles v Shane Warne - advantage Australia Giles has been thoroughly outbowled (no surprise there) and outbatted (that should be a more even contest), but has regained respect after his efforts at Edgbaston. Warne, like the true champion, has held a creaking side together, bowling tirelessly, batting impishly. Whatever the rumour mill says, Ponting must be relieved to have him on board. Giles: Up: The dismissal of Martyn at Old Trafford. Down: Treading on his stumps at Lord's. Warne: Up: The dismissals of Strauss. Down: Treading on his stumps at Edgbaston. Steve Harmison v Brett Lee - advantage Australia Harmison is not so well equipped for reverse swing and has only prospered in 'conventional' conditions at Lord's. Lee has become a key member of the attack after an 18-month absence from Test cricket, rapidly superseding Gillespie and Kasprowicz in the pecking order. Harmison: Up: Taking the last wicket at Edgbaston. Down: Failing to take the last wicket at Old Trafford. Lee: Up: At the crease and delirious at the end of the Old Trafford Test. Down: At the crease and devastated at the end of the Edgbaston Test. Simon Jones v Jason Gillespie - advantage England Jones' ability to reverse swing the old ball has stunned the Aussies. He's now an artist rather than a tearaway. Gillespie has only really contributed as an obdurate tail-ender as his confidence with ball has been shredded. He has surely played his last Test in this series. Jones Dismissing Michael Clarke with the perfect in-swinger. Down: Limping off with cramp at Old Trafford. Gillespie Up: Blocking alongside Warne in the first innings at Old Trafford. Down: Being carted everywhere in the second and third Tests. Matthew Hoggard v Michael Kasprowicz/Glenn McGrath - advantage Australia Hoggard has been England's one peripheral player - just 56 overs and three maidens in three matches. He's still waiting for conventional swing, but is hanging on. McGrath was awesome at Lord's, plucky at Old Trafford, while Kasprowicz almost became an Aussie legend at Edgbaston. Hoggard Dismissing Hayden first ball. Down: Forlornly loosening up for the call that seldom comes. Kasprowicz Up: His gallant last-wicket stand at Edgbaston. Down: Succumbing to Harmison with three runs required. McGrath Up: Devastating first spell at Lord's. Down: After treading on that ball at 9.15am on the Thursday of the Edgbaston Test."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
