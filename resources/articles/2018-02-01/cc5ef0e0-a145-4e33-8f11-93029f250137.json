The 14-times major champion, amid what is now more of a resurgence than a return from a fourth back surgery, should still be a key part of the Honda Classic denouement but the third day had promised so much more. Woods trails the tournament leader, Luke List, by seven. Justin Thomas and Webb Simpson are within one of List. Woods, who was almost picture perfect from tee to green, passed up a series of birdie chances in posting the 69 which moved him to even par in total. For injury context: this marked his first round in the 60s for 917 days. \u201cThese greens are a little bit tricky and even though I shot 69, it was probably the highest score I could have shot today,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI really hit it good. \u201cI can\u2019t be that annoyed because I played really well. I wish I\u2019d made a few more putts. Today was the best I\u2019ve hit it; I thought yesterday was pretty good but today was a little better.\u201d A top-five finish seems the most legitimate Woods aspiration now, even if he is still aiming higher. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to do something under par for sure,\u201d he added. \u201cYou never know what can happen on the last few holes here. A lot of things can happen and have happened in the past. First of all, I need to go and post a number. I\u2019m going to be far enough ahead of the leaders, probably 45 minutes or an hour; if I can go ahead and post a number early, you never know. I\u2019ve got a shot. My job is to go out and post a number.\u201d Woods has surpassed expectations by a considerable distance in south Florida \u2013 including, perhaps, his own \u2013 but the competitive animal within means he cut a disheartened figure when assessing a round that was played in the most favourable conditions of the week. Alex Noren\u2019s 65 \u2013 the Swede is now four under \u2013 emphasised that backdrop, with Thomas later matching that score. Woods reached the turn in 34, one under, courtesy of a birdie at the 8th. Putts for likewise had slipped by at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 9th. Woods was two under for the day when reaching the 15th, where he found water from the tee on Friday. In overcompensating when seeking to avoid a repeat, this time he pulled an iron into thick rough. A bogey followed, with Woods slipping to the same at 17 before a masterful chip at the last preceded a welcome birdie from tap-in range. Rory McIlroy\u2019s 73 included a damaging outward nine of 40. At seven over, McIlroy will be afforded an early finish to what marks his third event in as many weeks. Adam Scott\u2019s 67, his finest round of the week, hinted at better things to come for a former Masters champion who has been out of sorts in recent times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
