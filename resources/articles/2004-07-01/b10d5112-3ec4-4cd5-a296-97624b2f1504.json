Goode' echoed around the marble hall of a plush hotel. The crowd reacted like he was a visiting Hollywood celebrity, not the Democrat candidate for vice-president. There were shouts, screams and even a handful of wolf-whistles. Edwards gave a thumbs up and flashed his trademark smile as he waited for the noise to die down. He waited a long time. This was no small-town crowd in Hartford, the state capital of Connecticut. It was a supposedly staid gathering of local Democrat big shots, including the deputy governor, a senator and the state attorney general. Yet the reaction to Edwards was more pop star than politician. Edwards launched quickly into his stump speech, heaping praise on Democrat challenger John Kerry. He spoke in broad platitudes, phrases dripping with positive thoughts, as he eulogised the time he and Kerry have spent together. 'It was a terrific experience for us to bond,' he said. As Kerry and Edwards head for their party's convention in Boston this week, it has become clear that Edwards has caught the imagination of American Democrats. More than anyone else, the youthful 51-year-old former trial lawyer has finally rallied core Democrats enthusiastically to Kerry's cause. He has provided the passion and charisma that many thought was lacking in Kerry himself. 'John Edwards has left America with an appetite for more,' said Will Marshall, co-founder of the Democratic Leadership Council think-tank. 'He just exudes magnetism and that has been revving up the base.' Perhaps more than at any other time, Democrats are now going to their party convention united and determined to win. The convention gives them their first and best opportunity to portray themselves as a genuine administration in waiting. It is a sharp turnaround from just eight months ago. Then, as nine candidates battled it out for the nomination, the Democrats looked set for a protracted civil war. But now, after Kerry's swift victory, they stand just ahead of President George Bush in the polls. But it is not just unity the Democrats will have in their Boston stronghold. They believe they can win. 'We have that rare thing: both unity and confidence,' Marshall said. The night before Edwards's campaign stop in Hartford, a line of sleek black limos pulled up outside the Maritime Hotel in Manhattan. They disgorged glamorous inhabitants who drifted inside to one of New York's hottest summer nightspots. They too, like the Democrat bigwigs of Connecticut, had come to see Edwards. His motorcade arrived at the back of the hotel but a small crowd of onlookers spotted him. 'Good luck! I am with you all the way,' said one woman. Edwards flashed his smile at her. A passing actress (this was New York, after all), was equally enthusiastic about her glimpse. 'I love Edwards and not just because he is good looking. He speaks for me. He is very dynamic. He is a real person,' she said. Edwards's appeal is broad. Since Kerry picked him, he has crisscrossed the country remorselessly as the Democrats' not-very-secret weapon. He has spoken to audiences in Iowa, New Orleans, Texas, Los Angeles, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. He has covered the bases from people's front porches, to town halls, to Hollywood dinner parties. He has been to Democrat strongholds, Republican bastions and across the battleground states of the Midwest. At the Maritime, Edwards' crowd was composed of young, wealthy Manhattanites. Each had paid $1,000 to attend the gathering in the hotel's cavernous Hiro nightclub. Behind him unfurled a huge banner extolling: 'A new team for a new America.' As usual, Edwards jumped enthusiastically on stage. 'We stand for the opportunities that are available to everyone,' he told his audience: 'It is about opportunity for all, not just the few at the top. But for everybody.' That Edwards was addressing members of 'the few' did not seem to matter. The crowd lapped up his rhetoric. It was their cash, not their approval, that Edwards was after. After the Mar itime, he hustled off to a private $25,000-a-head party at the home of Lehman Brothers banker George Young. Then he went to another Manhattan nightclub, the famed Crobar in Chelsea, to meet more trendy young things. All in all Edwards raised $1.3 million from the day. That was not unusual. As well as inspiring Democrats to flock to Kerry's cause, he has become one of the party's most powerful fundraisers. In his first week of solo campaigning after being picked, Edwards brought in $4.2 million. All of that cash is being diverted to party activists in the vital swing states that hold the key to victory in November. Edwards has brought balance to Kerry's campaign. His populist style and southern accent have reached out to many put off by Kerry's wooden demeanour and background of north-eastern liberal politics. Edwards also gets away from Kerry's image of 'politics as usual'. Edwards, who has served just one term as a senator, rose to fame as an outsider candidate offering a fresh face in Washington. Edwards is also a gifted speaker. In Hartford, as on most of his stops, he spoke briefly. But in his 10 minutes of chat he touched skilfully on all his main themes. He told his own story of being the son of a millworker, the first in his family to go to college. 'I have every reason to love America. I have had so many opportunities,' he said. He then moved on to praise Kerry, citing his record as a war hero in Vietnam and the former boatmates who have joined his campaign. 'These men put their lives in John Kerry's hands. They trusted him. He is a man of courage, strength and backbone. He will not leave any American behind,' he said. Edwards's speaking style is long on soft phrases and optimism and short on specifics. 'Our fundamental belief is that tomorrow can be better than today. That if we put our minds to it, there is nothing we can't do,' he said before adding: 'Embrace the politics of hope. Embrace the politics of what is possible, because this is America where everything is possible.' Such pronouncements in a political speech might sound pat to a cynical European ear, but Edwards has had crowds eating out of his hands across America. He knows what works. In fact, Edwards's message of optimism in recent weeks has been a dry run for what will emerge from Boston. Optimism, not attacking Bush, is now seen as the key to success. Kerry is now preparing for a convention address that will be the most important speech of his political life. Democrat strategists are working hard to craft a positive message as Kerry effectively makes his debut before the nation. 'They are going to offer a far more optimistic view of what Americans are capable of. They are going to talk about opportunity,' said Bill Buck, a former Clinton White House staffer. The thinking is simple. Surveys show that both sides' core support is already cemented firmly in place. Many pundits expected picking Edwards to give Kerry a major boost in the polls. But the 'bounce' was surprisingly small. Many experts are expecting similar small 'bounces' to happen after Boston and - for the Republicans - after their own convention at the end of August. 'This is not a big bounce electorate,' said top pollster John Zogby. 'Where we are today is probably where we are going to be through much of the summer, if not through most of this campaign.' Strategists on both sides expect the polls to barely shift right up until election day. This is the '50-50 Nation' where America is split clearly into red Republican states and blue Democrat ones. Nearly every polling indicator backs up the sense that the election stands on a knife-edge. Bush's approval ratings constantly hover above the 40 per cent line seen as guaranteeing defeat but below the 50 per cent line that could predict victory. That means a narrow middle ground, scattered mostly in the Midwest and Florida, will decide the election. Democrats believe those scarce swing voters will be more effectively reached by an optimistic message than attacks on Bush. The Republicans too may be swaying to a more positive viewpoint. Though attack adverts portraying Kerry as a 'flip flopper' are unlikely to disappear, last week, for the first time, Bush outlined his plans for a second term. They revealed familiar themes of national security, lower taxes and education reform. Bush's famous 'folksy' manner is also still a big hit with American voters and comes across well on television. Meanwhile, polls show Kerry still has problems with convincing voters what he stands for, and he has yet to cultivate a clear positive image. While familiar faces, like Al Gore and Senator Ted Kennedy, will probably play to the faithful and launch passionate assaults on Bush, Kerry will stay out of the fray in the convention. He will stick to a message that plays on his dramatic personal history during Vietnam, his patriotism and a positive message on jobs and the economy. Boston will give Kerry his best chance to get that message across. Edwards's perpetual sunniness will help. But is it enough? Many Democrats believe Edwards is a superb match for Vice President Dick Cheney. When Edwards was introduced in Hartford, it was with the words: 'Is it just me or does Dick Cheney look positively sick these days?' That is too simplistic an assessment. Cheney, with his dour manner and links to the oil business, is the Democrats' favourite bugbear. Yet he is popular with many Republicans. Cheney energises their conservative base in the same way that Edwards works for Democrats. He will also be no pushover in the televised debate with Edwards. 'He is dangerous for Democrats and they underestimate him at their peril,' Marshall said. But no one was telling that to the Hartford Democrats. Edwards wrapped up his speech and, taking off his jacket, descended into the crowd. He was mobbed. One woman grasped both his hands in hers. 'We love you,' she beamed and repeated: 'We love you.' But, as the Democrats celebrated, outside the hotel a crowd of Republican students had gathered. They carried signs warning of Democrat tax hikes. One read: 'Honk, if you love Dick Cheney.' It seemed an unlikely idea, but several passing cars enthusiastically blared their horns. With the nation divided down the middle, it was proof that Democrats should take nothing for granted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
