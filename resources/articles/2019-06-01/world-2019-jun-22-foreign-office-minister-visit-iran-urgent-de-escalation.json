Andrew Murrison, the MP for South West Wiltshire who covers the Middle East as part of his brief, will raise UK and international concerns about Iran\u2019s \u201cregional conduct and its threat to cease complying with the nuclear deal to which the UK remains fully committed\u201d during \u201cfrank and constructive\u201d talks with the government in Tehran. \u201cAt this time of increased regional tensions and at a crucial period for the future of the nuclear deal, this visit is an opportunity for further open, frank and constructive engagement with the government of Iran,\u201d the Foreign Office said. Iran claimed the downed aircraft was \u201cspying\u201d in its airspace and had crossed a \u201cred line\u201d. However, Washington said the incident had occurred in international airspace. UK relations with Iran have been dominated by the ongoing imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian national who has always denied the spying allegations upon which she has been held in Iran since 2016. Speaking about Murrison\u2019s planned visit to Iran, her husband Richard Ratcliffe said: \u201cI\u2019ve been asked how hopeful I am. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m hopeful, but certainly will be watching very closely to see how things develop and what comes back.\u201d Ratcliffe is on day eight of a hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London in solidarity with Zaghari-Ratcliffe. \u201c[Murrison will] be talking to the foreign ministry; we\u2019ll be looking to see what reaction comes from inside the prison to those conversations,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cThe sooner the British government\u2019s able to work with the Iranian government and find a resolution, that\u2019s better for our family, for sure.\u201d However, US-Iran relations have overshadowed her ongoing confinement, and while both countries have said they do not have any appetite for conflict Donald Trump told NBC on Friday that if it comes, Iran would experience \u201cobliteration like you\u2019ve never seen before ... but I\u2019m not looking to do that\u201d. Trump said the US was \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate against Iran, but that he had cancelled planned strikes just minutes before they were to be carried out on Thursday after being told 150 people could die. Iran has vowed to defend its borders. \u201cRegardless of any decision [US officials] make\u2026 we will not allow any of Iran\u2019s borders to be violated,\u201d the foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi, told Tasnim, a semi-official news agency. \u201cIran will firmly confront any aggression or threat by America.\u201d Last year, the US unilaterally pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six other powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. International sanctions had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. A senior Arab diplomat said sharply increased tensions would further harm the crisis-hit Middle East region. \u201cDe-escalation is very important because tempers are flaring\u2026 It\u2019s very important we avoid confrontation right now,\u201d they told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. \u201cConfrontation, whatever we think about Trump or Iran, will be disastrous for everyone.\u201d On Saturday, Etihad Airways followed Qantas, British Airways, Lufthansa and a number of other airlines and suspended \u201cuntil further notice\u201d operations through Iranian airspace over the Straits of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman. The United Arab Emirates-based carrier said \u201cthe safety of our passengers and staff is the highest priority\u201d and that it would use alternative flight paths on a number of routes to and from Abu Dhabi. The US has warned that commercial airliners could be mistakenly attacked after the US Navy Global Hawk drone was shot down on Thursday. Tehran dismissed the concerns, which come 30 years after the US Navy accidentally shot down an Iranian civilian flight flying in Iranian airspace, killing almost 300 people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
