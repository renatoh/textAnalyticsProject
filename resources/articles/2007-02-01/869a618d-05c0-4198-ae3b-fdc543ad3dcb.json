Unfortunately, Orange didn't action my request and then ignored (and subsequently denied ever having received) my letters and faxes of complaint. I complained to the Communications and Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS) for resolution, but it accepted Orange's defence of plausible deniability and ruled against me. I would have accepted that ruling and paid off the debt I don't believe I owe just to close off the issue, but I've since written to the debt collection agency on five occasions - the last time by registered post - telling them my new address and offering to pay the debt, with no reply. I now have a default of \u00a379 on my credit file for a debt I don't believe I ever owed, and am not being allowed to pay. Even if I do pay it, the default remains on my otherwise clean credit file. This is seriously affecting my ability to obtain credit and could also affect my future employment prospects (I work in the financial services sector). Is there any higher authority to which I can appeal to get this situation remedied? JE A At first glance it seemed as if Moorcroft Debt Recovery - the debt collection agency in question - was in breach of Office of Fair Trading guidance on debt collection because it is not responding to your offers to pay off the debt. However, according to Orange you no longer owe Moorcroft any money. The CISAS ruling actually passed the debt back to Orange, which wrote it off as a bad debt. So as far as Moorcroft is concerned you are not one of its debtors, which explains why it is ignoring your letters. If you want to clear this debt you need to make a payment to Orange, either by calling its executive office on 0870 870 0862, or by sending a cheque to Orange Payment Processing, Global House, Senhouse Road, Darlington, Co Durham DL1 4YQ. Alternatively you can go into any Orange mobile store with your old account number and pay by cash or cheque. Unfortunately, the default will remain on your credit record for six years. However, you can add a short note of explanation to any piece of information on your credit file, and lenders may take this into account when credit-scoring you. But I don't think a default of this size and nature will have any serious impact on your chances of securing a mortgage or your employment prospects."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
