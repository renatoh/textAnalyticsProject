Mourinho was incensed that Mart\u00ednez conducted the first post-match press conference in the media room at Goodison when, as the away manager, he had expected to begin the inquest into Chelsea\u2019s 3-1 defeat before joining his players on the waiting team coach. The Everton manager was hosting a separate, customary briefing with national newspaper journalists on a concourse outside the media room, and away from the television cameras, when Mourinho approached en route to his press conference. He interrupted Mart\u00ednez\u2019s discussion to say: \u201cRoberto, Roberto, next time tell me to go before you because we have to travel.\u201d His opposite number replied: \u201cI don\u2019t control that, Jos\u00e9. I don\u2019t control that.\u201d To which an exasperated Mourinho shouted: \u201cFucking hell,\u201d before walking off. With the Chelsea manager gone, Mart\u00ednez, cup of coffee in hand, said: \u201cWhen he beat us 6-3 last season he was such a nice man. I prefer him like that.\u201d Asked whether he would invite Mourinho for a traditional post-match drink, the Everton manager replied: \u201cOf course \u2013 and I am sure he\u2019s going to come round.\u201d Mourinho later apologised to the national newspaper journalists for not conducting a separate post-match briefing, politely explaining he had to go because Chelsea\u2019s departure from Goodison had been delayed by the confusion over media schedules. The Chelsea manager did not conduct a lengthy inquest into the champions\u2019 third defeat in five games with his players either. Within minutes of the final whistle sounding on Saturday, Mourinho was on his phone in a corridor outside the away changing room rather than addressing the Chelsea squad. Branislav Ivanovic admitted Chelsea have more pressing concerns than an 11-point deficit on the league leaders, Manchester City, with their lack of concentration and form requiring immediate attention. \u201cWe cannot think about catching other teams we just have to win game by game,\u201d said the Serbia international. \u201cWe must not think about anything else other than the next game. When you are not winning games it is difficult. All you can do is work hard, get back on the winning way. One big win and things will change for Chelsea.\u201d The struggling defender added: \u201cIt is very difficult, especially now, when you see that we are not in our top form and I hope we will change it soon. \u201cIt is already late for us. The game was hard but also the game changed. We tried and dominated most of the game but a couple of situations we lost concentration and we conceded goals. We are getting punished for all our mistakes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
