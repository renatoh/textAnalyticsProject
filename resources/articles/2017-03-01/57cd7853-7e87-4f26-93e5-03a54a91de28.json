On the same day that models took to the catwalk for brands including Maison Margiela and Lanvin, Balenciaga \u2013 one of the most influential labels \u2013 said it had sacked its casting agency after a prominent casting director said models had been subjected to \u201csadistic and cruel\u201d treatment. In an Instagram post on Tuesday, James Scully, a veteran of the industry, wrote: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed to come to Paris and hear that the usual suspects are up to the same tricks.\u201d He alleged that at a recent Balenciaga casting, 150 models had been made to wait in a dark stairwell for hours while a pair of casting directors who Scully claimed were \u201cserial abusers\u201d ate their lunch. \u201cIn their usual fashion they shut the door, went to lunch and turned off the lights to the stairs leaving every girl with only the lights of their phones to see,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot only was this sadistic and cruel it was dangerous and left more than a few of the girls I spoke with traumatised.\u201d Balenciaga said on Wednesday that there had been \u201cissues\u201d with a recent model casting. In a statement, the French luxury fashion house said it had made \u201cradical changes\u201d to the casting process and had stopped using the accused agency. \u201cAdditionally, Balenciaga sent a written apology to the agencies of the models who were affected by this specific situation, asking them to share it with them,\u201d it said. \u201cBalenciaga condemns this incident and will continue to be deeply committed to ensure the most respectful working conditions for the models.\u201d Maida Gregori Boina, one of the casting directors accused by Scully, denied the allegations and said that she condemned him \u201cfor posting inaccurate and libellous remarks\u201d. Scully, whose post garnered support from supermodels Joan Smalls, Helena Christensen and Carolyn Murphy, also accused the French label Lanvin of discrimination against black models. \u201cI have heard from several agents, some of whom are black, that they have received (a) mandate from Lanvin that they do not want to be presented with women of colour,\u201d he wrote. Lanvin vehemently denied Scully\u2019s accusation. A representative told the Guardian that the casting of Lanvin\u2019s last show was diverse. \u201cYou will agree, therefore, that the comments made by James Scully regarding Lanvin on his Instagram post are a serious allegation and completely untrue.\u201d The brand\u2019s designer Bouchra Jarrar, also hit back strongly after showing her autumn-winter collection on Wednesday. \u201cThey insult the couture houses with their accusations of racism,\u201d she told AFP. \u201cWhat are they talking about? Our dressing room is full of girls from every origin. In fact, there is not a single French person in it.\u201d Scully also accused a major Paris fashion house, which he did not name, of trying to \u201csneak in\u201d 15-year-old models for its show, writing: \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable to me that people have no regard for human decency or the lives and feelings of these girls, especially when too, too many of these models are under the age of 18 and clearly not equipped to be here.\u201d Top British model Edie Campbell told the Guardian that Scully\u2019s description of the models\u2019 alleged treatment at casting for the Balenciaga show was nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cIt\u2019s also probably not the most shocking example I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI\u2019ve been incredibly lucky. I have \u2013 by luck and by good management \u2013 made it to the top 1% who manage to have a voice and agency over their own careers. [But] I have witnessed a lot of upsetting things. I\u2019ve seen girls be told to run laps around the studio. It\u2019s a cattle market. \u201cThe problem with fashion in that it is a very informal industry. Boundaries are crossed and it allows people to behave in ways that would not ever be accepted in any other \u2018work\u2019 environment,\u201d Campbell continued. \u201cIt is also a closed system. If you speak out, you are faced with the very real threat of never working again. And that is why what James is doing is so unbelievably brave and should be applauded.\u201d Singer and model Rina Sawayama said she had experienced shocking racism on photoshoots with major global brands. \u201cSometimes when you are the only person of colour on set you feel as though you just need to put your head down, just lucky you\u2019re there anyway, got to please them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut luckily things are changing and the conversation is shifting. It will take ages but social media speeds things up.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
