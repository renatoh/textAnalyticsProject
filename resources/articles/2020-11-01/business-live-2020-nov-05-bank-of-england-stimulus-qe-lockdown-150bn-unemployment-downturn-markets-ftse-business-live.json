Results from Tuesday\u2019s vote were still being tabulated in a few key states, though Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was near the minimum 270 votes in the state-by-state Electoral College needed to win the White House. The policy statement released after the U.S. central bank\u2019s latest two-day meeting did not mention the election. In a news conference after the release of the statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is now recovering more slowly after being boosted earlier in the year by fiscal aid and the re-opening of some businesses. \u201cThe overall rebound in household spending owes in part to stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals,\u201d Powell told reporters. He also said the recent rise in coronavirus infections in the United States and abroad was \u201cparticularly concerning,\u201d and said social distancing and masks were needed to help contain the virus and support the economy. \u201cA full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it\u2019s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities,\u201d Powell said. The key message from Jerome Powell tonight is that fiscal and monetary policy both have an essential role to play in helping the economy. So with the Covid-10 pandemic continuing, and previous fiscal support running out, \u201cIt\u2019s likely that further support is likely to be needed from monetary policy &amp; fiscal policy\u201d, he says. Federal reserve chair Jerome Powell is holding a press conference now to explain why the Fed left policy unchanged. Powell says the US economy has \u2018continued to recover\u2019, but in recent months the pace of this recovery has moderated.... as has the pace of job creation. He pledges that the central bank will not lose sight of the millions of people out of work following an economic dislocation that has \u201cupended lives\u201d and \u201ccreated uncertainty\u201d. Looking ahead, Powell says the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain. The recent rise in Covid-19 cases is very concerning, he continues: It\u2019s extremely hard to see the Fed making any interesting changes until the US election is resolved. As Aaron Anderson, SVP of Research at Fisher Investments, puts it: \u201cThe Fed has been clear that changes to monetary policy are off the table for the time being, and Powell is standing firm on additional easing. Economic data is improving, which has included a very strong Q3 GDP report. Markets have been a little rocky with both stocks and bonds pulling back recently, but not dramatically. We expect the Fed to remain comfortable with the status quo for now, at least until the political backdrop becomes more clear.\u201d On Wall Street, stocks are continuing to reverse those recent losses - with the Dow up another 572 points (2%) today. Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, explains why the Fed\u2019s decision is hardly a surprise: \u201cThe decision to hold rates will not shock the market. The Fed has indicated that the federal funds rate is likely to be held near zero for several more years until it sees inflation rise, while expanding its balance sheet and using its special facilities to lend. However, these tools are stretched already. Many Fed officials have been urging Congress to pass more fiscal relief, as that would likely have a more immediate effect in boosting growth, employment, and inflation. The Federal Reserve has also warned that America\u2019s recovery is \u201csignificantly\u201d dependant on the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has battered the economy this year. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term Just in: America\u2019s central bank has left US interest rates at record lows. That\u2019s really not a surprise (even if there wasn\u2019t an election count going on...) After its regular policy meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would hold the Fed funds rate at between 0 per cent and 0.25 per cent. It also outlined that interest rates won\u2019t move until the Fed sees \u2018maximum employment\u2019, and inflation back at target. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longerrun goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee\u2019s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Bentley, the luxury carmaker, will stop making fossil fuel cars by 2030 and aims to be completely carbon neutral at the same time, in one of the most ambitious plans of any UK car manufacturer in the transition towards electric vehicles. It will stop building cars with traditional internal combustion engines within six years, instead making hybrids and then its first battery electric cars in 2025. By 2030 it will sell only pure battery electric vehicles, with zero-carbon exhaust emissions. The rapid transition will mean that a company famed for enormous 12-cylinder petrol engines, with large carbon dioxide emissions to match, aims to become one of the UK automotive industry\u2019s leading champions of environmental sustainability. We have some late takeover excitement too. Insurance group RSA has received a \u00a37bn approach from Canadian insurer Intact Financial and Danish insurer Tryg. In a statement to the City, after the market closed, RSA says: The Board of RSA Insurance Group plc (\u201cRSA\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) notes the recent media speculation regarding the possibility of an offer for the entire issued share capital of the Company and confirms that on 2 October 2020 it received a proposal from Intact Financial Corporation and Tryg A/S (together, the \u201cConsortium\u201d) regarding a possible offer for the Company \u201cthe Proposal\u201d). This may or may not lead to an offer being made for RSA. The Proposal comprises 685 pence in cash per RSA share, plus payment by RSA of the announced interim dividend of 8 pence per share. Shares in RSA shot up by 45% just before the close of trading, to 670p, from 459.7p yesterday. That followed a Bloomberg report that an approach had been made. RSA also says that it has indicated to the Consortium that it would be minded to recommend the Proposal, subject to satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the possible offer, including a period of due diligence. Accordingly, RSA is engaged in discussions with the Consortium in relation to the possible offer. Today\u2019s selloff has pushed the dollar down-- just as Bitcoin hits its highest level since 2018.... Some late legal news. Dominic Chappell, the businessman who bought the BHS retail chain for \u00a31, has been been jailed for six years for evading \u00a3584,000 in taxes. Chappell, failed to pay the tax on \u00a32.2m in income he received after buying the chain in 2015 from Sir Philip Green - the year before it collapsed. Europe\u2019s stock markets have closed solidly higher, with the Stoxx 600 index gaining 1%. Every sector rallied, led by consumer cyclicals, technology firms, miners and industrial companies. With volatility ebbing, equities had another decent day, with no sign of election jitteriness. It\u2019s quite a change compared to last week, when European stocks had their worst run since June. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the day: Investors showed no fear of jinxing the election result on Thursday, continuing to full-force barrel into equities on the assumption that Joe Biden will be POTUS come January. Little has changed since this morning. Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Nevada are all still on a knife-edge, with many votes left to count, and hours, days and potentially weeks \u2013 dependent on Trump\u2019s legal challenges \u2013 left in the whole process. Yet, as they did on Tuesday and Wednesday, the markets have used the likelihood of a Biden presidency, even if it isn\u2019t accompanied by the anticipated \u2018blue wave\u2019, as an excuse to drag themselves out of the covid-shaped hole they found themselves in by the end of October. The US dollar is weakening against other major currencies today. Sterling has risen almost a cent and a half against the dollar, to $1.312 -- not perhaps the obvious reaction to the Bank of England boosting its money-printing QE programme. The euro is also rallying, up nearly a cent at $1.181. David Madden of CMC Markets says investors are in a risk-on mood, which usually puts the dollar out of favour: The US dollar is in the red as traders are content to take on more risk and plough their cash into equities and metals \u2013 assets that are considered to be riskier. No change from the Fed is expected this evening and seeing as there is political uncertainty in the US, we won\u2019t be getting any fiscal boost from the government anytime soon, and therefore the central bank will probably reiterate its willingness to support the economy. Bloomberg\u2019s Joanna Ossinger has a few theories for bitcoin\u2019s strong rally over $15,000 today: Whether it\u2019s uncertainty from the U.S. election, the future of the pandemic or simply more investor interest, the cryptocurrency is at the highest level since January 2018. The digital currency has been benefiting from high-profile investments from the likes of Square Inc. and Paul Tudor Jones. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\u2019s JPM Coin was reportedly used to make a payment for the first time. Proponents argue bitcoin can be a diversifier in times of uncertainty, so events like lockdowns across Europe or delays of U.S. election results could be fueling its rise. But Bitcoin has a track record of volatility, of course... Bitcoin has made parabolic runs upward before, notably December 2017 and mid-2019, before major tumbles. And many strategists and investors are skeptical. Empire Financial Research\u2019s Whitney Tilson said in an email Wednesday that he still regards cryptocurrencies as \u201ca techno-libertarian pump-and-dump scheme\u201d and recommends most investors avoid them. Speaking of \u2018almost vertical\u2019 moves, Bitcoin has surged by over 8% today to its highest level since early 2018. The cryptocurrency has risen over $15,200 today, up $1,200 since yesterday. Simon Peters, cryptoasset analyst at eToro, reckons Bitcoin is benefitting from prospects of a new US stimulus package being agreed (once the election process has played out). A massive new fiscal spending push would also push up US borrowing, weaken the dollar and lift inflation, the theory goes... \u201cBitcoin has been on a sustained push through a number of significant price points recently \u2013 first $12,000, then $14,000 and now $15,000. Investors place a lot of credence in these so-called \u2018resistance levels\u2019, as they are points at which buying or selling activity often occurs. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s creation was in part due to fears that increased fiscal stimulus is devaluing currencies globally. As a result, when central banks announce extensive plans to pump money into economies, many investors in the crypto community take this as a major bitcoin buy signal. \u201cWith the US election gradually drawing to a close, the details of a fiscal stimulus could become clearer. Any such package could see weakening of the US dollar and further increases in the bitcoin price going forward. Our economics editor Larry Elliott spots a change in Rishi Sunak\u2019s furlough scheme announcement today: There is a limit to what the Bank of England can do to boost activity, and that piles extra pressure on Sunak. Over the past couple of months, the chancellor has dropped talk of saving only \u201cviable\u201d jobs and is now in \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d mode. It was significant that his latest statement did not include any mention of eventually taking steps to reduce the record peacetime deficit the UK will run in the current financial year. The risk of doing too little is seen as greater than that of doing too much. The market reaction to the US election is \u2018incredible\u2019, says Saxo Bank\u2019s John Hardy. Equities and bonds have gone \u2018almost vertical since Election Night\u2019, he writes, despite president Trump hotly contesting the results and the prospects for two years of ugly political gridlock. There may be technical reasons for this wild bounce: The most likely immediate driver of the action could simply be that the market has put on excessive volatility hedges on the election uncertainty, and that the unwinding of these hedges (despite the outcome) means the need to unwind short equity futures and short U.S. T-bond futures contracts. But is gridlock really good for markets?. Hardy suggests risk sentiment could fade.... Other, less obvious, contributions to the enthusiasm are that the avoidance of the \u201cBlue Wave\u201d scenario means we avoid any corporate tax hikes and the possibly of much lower inflation risks on the shortfall of stimulus. Further down the road, one has to wonder if risk sentiment on the outlook could quickly be tempered or worse after this initial relief trade on the risks to growth on lower stimulus prospects and economic scarring from the Covid-19 crisis. Yes, the Fed will try to do more at the margin, but monetary policy is weak medicine compared to fiscal policy at the zero boun The New York stock exchange has also opened higher, as yesterday\u2019s post-Election Day rally continues. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 1.4%, or 389 points, to 28,237. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is 1.7% higher, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is 2% higher. Investors seem to be pricing a split government in Washington, with Democrat hopes of a Blue Wave in the Senate fading. If the Republicans maintain their majority in the upper house, there is less chance of higher taxes on corporations, and tighter regulation of technology firms. Adam Vettese, analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, says: \u201cMarkets seem to be banking on Joe Biden becoming the next US President with US indices up yesterday, despite the fact the result is not yet nailed on. \u201cThe futures market indicate that US shares will open strongly, indicating that investors are brushing off Donald Trump\u2019s threats to contest the result in court. \u201cIf Biden does become President but the Democrats don\u2019t win control of the Senate, that makes the threat of tax rises recede a little, which will please markets. \u201cBut either way, the main focus now should be agreeing a fresh stimulus package to shield the US economy from the economic fallout a second wave could cause. European stock markets are racking up their fourth day of gains this week, as investors continue to watch the US election drama unfold. The main indices are all higher, with Germany\u2019s DAX leading the way with a 1.4% gain. The FTSE 100 is up around 0.5%, or 29 points, at 5913, the highest in over two weeks. The Bank of England\u2019s new \u00a3150bn QE stimulus programme has reminded investors that central banks aren\u2019t out of firepower in the face of the Covid-19 slump. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: \u201cStock markets continue to take the US election in a positive frame of mind, and with the BoE throwing more QE into the fray, the second central bank to do so in a week, the outlook for stocks continues to brighten. \u201cLast week\u2019s selloff looks more and more like pre-election jitters, a bout of nervousness that has been reversed even more swiftly than it appears. \u201cIt is true that the US election is yet to be officially decided, but Biden seems likely to cross the 270 vote threshold in coming days, potentially rendering Trump\u2019s legal challenges irrelevant, and with this bump in the road removed, stock markets can rally once more. \u201cThe BoE\u2019s outlook for the UK economy is understandably grim, prompting the move towards more QE, but as in the US the real boost will come from fiscal stimulus, and at least here there is some good news thanks to the chancellor\u2019s decision to extend furlough. On the other hand, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is not impressed by the furlough scheme extension: Resolution\u2019s Torsten Bell is also concerned that the government\u2019s support is not well targeted. Following Rishi Sunak\u2019s latest furlough scheme extension, there are also calls for more help to prevent unemployment spiralling even higher next year. Nigel Morris, employment tax director at MHA MacIntyre Hudson, says: \u201cA UK wide furlough scheme with a fixed end-date and the flexibility to manage local and regional restrictions will be a real help for business drawing up their budgets. Companies now know what they need to pay out in NIC and pension costs over the coming months. The fact the Job Retention Bonus (JRB) and Job Support Scheme (JSS) have been deferred also provides additional clarity; businesses no longer face the prospect of grappling with a whole new set of rules, or the admin juggling act of using multiple support schemes. Kate Nicholls, CEO of industry group UK Hospitality says the new furlough extension will save jobs, but it\u2019s not enough on its own: \u201cExtending the furlough scheme is a big boost and will help secure hospitality jobs in the medium term across the whole of the UK. Keeping jobs alive during this lockdown and throughout a bleak-looking winter period, which is likely to see businesses trading under severe restrictions, is key to the future survival of the sector. \u201cHospitality is facing a tough winter ahead, though, and businesses will need additional support if they are to survive. We will need enhanced grant support to keep venues alive and a solution to the ongoing rent debt problem that continues to linger over the sector. These must come alongside a clear roadmap for a return to business. Without these, the extended furlough scheme alone is not enough to keep hospitality alive and will have been a wasted investment of public funds. \u201cSurviving the winter is just the first step, too. Beyond that we need action to ensure that businesses can be revived and the sector can play its part in rebuilding the economy. Extending the VAT cut and business rates holiday, coupled with extensive Government promotion of tourism and hospitality, will be the bare minimum required.\u201d Mike Hibbs, employment partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, agrees that winter will be tricky for many firms: \u201cEven under a new lockdown, many sectors \u2013 retail and hospitality - will be preparing for Christmas trading and managing staffing levels could prove to be tricky. A careful juggling act will be needed to strike a balance between taking advantage of the furlough scheme and ensuring adequate staff numbers are in place to meet heightened demand. \u201cWhilst millions of jobs will be protected over the winter months, a question mark does still hover over whether the Government is still simply delaying the inevitable cliff edge of job cuts, which was expected in October. Businesses should use this time wisely to seize every opportunity to make the most of the support available, whilst taking every measure to ensure that as many furloughed employees as possible can come back into work full time once the scheme ends. You\u2019d be forgiven for losing track of the government\u2019s various job protection schemes... The Bank of England and the Treasury have delivered a double-whammy of fiscal and monetary help today -- \u00a3150bn of fresh stimulus, swiftly followed by the furlough extension. The Bank of England\u2019s new quantitative easing move will help keep government borrowing costs very low, and mop up more of the huge deficit incurred under the pandemic [the government sells the debt to investors, who sell it onto the BoE]. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, reckons the UK could end up borrowing \u00a3400bn this financial year - more than double the record after the financial crisis. But she also warns that some jobs have already been lost before today\u2019s announcement: \u201cAnnouncements today by the Bank of England and the Chancellor will save some jobs in the most affected sectors although may come too late for some businesses that have already made plans to downsize. \u201cThe Government will now need to focus on providing additional support to those who will lose their income despite the extra measures - and many workers will require help in retraining so they can move to other parts of the economy where growth is likely to be. \u201cThe cost of these measures will add to government borrowing this year and could reach at least \u00a3400bn for the financial year ending March 2021. However, the Bank of England\u2019s additional QE efforts will help keep funding costs low despite these high figures.\u201d The latest healthcheck on UK construction shows that housebuilding is pretty strong, but civil engineering is much weaker. IHS Markit\u2019s monthly PMI survey shows that home construction was \u201cby far the best-performing area of construction activity in October\u201d, with builders reporting pent-up demand and improving housing market conditions in recent months. Commercial activity also rose, but less strongly, while civil engineering activity shrank at a faster rate. So overall, construction kept growing, but at the slowest rate in five months. Markit\u2019s construction PMI dropped to 53.1, from 56.8 in September (anything over 50 shows growth). Here\u2019s the breakdown: New order books grew at the strongest pace since December 2015. But disappointingly, building firms kept cutting staff last month. Markit says: Efforts to reduce overheads and ongoing economic uncertainty contributed to a further decline in staffing numbers across the construction sector. The rate of job shedding was nonetheless much slower than seen in the second quarter of 2020. Here\u2019s the full story: Just in: The job protection furlough scheme will be extended until the end of March. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has just announced the plan in the House of Commons. It means that the government will pay 80% of the wages of workers who are temporarily laid off during the pandemic (up to \u00a32,500 per month). My colleague Richard Partington explains: Rishi Sunak has announced the government will extend furlough until the end of March next year as the second coronavirus wave and renewed lockdown measures threaten to drive up unemployment. In a major climbdown for the government after multiple changes to its economic support packages in recent weeks, the chancellor said the Treasury would continue to pay 80% of workers\u2019 wages. Employers will only need to pay the cost of pension and national insurance contributions. Sunak said the job retention bonus \u2013 a \u00a31,000 payment to firms for retaining furloughed staff until the end of January, expected to cost up to \u00a39bn \u2013 would be scrapped because of the new extension in furlough. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Treasury Committee chair and Conservative MP Mel Stride is renewing calls for the Treasury to release forecasts about the \u201ceconomic impacts and the associated harms\u201d of all the Covid interventions considered by the government, including new lockdown measures in England. He told the Guardian on Thursday: \u201cIt would be almost inconceivable for government to be taking decisions without even thinking about these issues and I\u2019m 99.9% certain that the Treasury will have done this work, and therefore I believe it should be made public.\u201d Sage minutes from September suggest the Treasury has been working on that analysis. But the Treasury has so far refused calls to release that information to the public, saying official forecasts are left to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). But Stride said the estimated impact of the month-long lockdown is \u201cnot something that the OBR opines upon directly, but it is something that the Sage minutes of the 21st of September state that the government\u2019s chief economic adviser has been engaged upon.\u201d Stride originally wanted the data released before yesterday\u2019s Commons vote on the lockdown measures. He backed that vote, but said \u201cthere are lots of questions that remain unanswered.\u201d Stride hopes the data is released before the next OBR report on 25 November. \u201cI see no reason why we shouldn\u2019t get it well before that. And really... the sooner the better.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to push and will continue to press, and I\u2019ll publicly continue to make the argument [for the forecasts to be released].\u201d Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank, reckons the Bank of England may need to consider cutting interest rates below zero next year, if the situation doesn\u2019t improve. He points out that the power of QE diminishes, the more of it you do (government bond yields are already near record lows): The BoE did not give any further insight into its thinking on negative interest rates, having set out its views in the August monetary policy report. Futures markets continue to edge closer to pricing in negative rates although they are not expected to come into effect before next summer. As it current stands, the markets are pricing an overnight rate of minus 8.2 bps by September 2021 versus plus 5 bps today which implies a probability in excess of 50% of a 25 bps cut. Our forecast remains predicated on the assumption that interest rates will not fall below zero but there are mounting risks to this view. For one thing, negative rates are in operation in a number of economies around the world as they become an accepted part of the monetary policy toolkit. In addition it is widely accepted that the marginal benefits of QE become smaller, the higher is the total of assets purchased. If the economy does not improve as the BoE expects, the negative rates option will get serious consideration. The Bank of England\u2019s projection that unemployment will hit 7.75% next summer is a another blow to companies reliant on consumer spending. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: As the unemployment rate is forecast to increase to around 6.3% by the end of the year and to almost 8% early in 2021, consumer demand is likely to take another hit as incomes are squeezed. That will make it even harder for businesses relying on discretionary spending to bounce back. There is going to be a painful period ahead, as companies are forced to adapt to the change in consumer demand and the shift to online and there could be supply shortages if companies don\u2019t get the investment they need to transform. Many of those companies have just been ordered to lock down, leaving many extremely worried about Christmas trading. Today\u2019s \u00a3150bn flurry of QE won\u2019t be the last from the Bank of England, predicts Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics. She writes: We were virtually the only forecaster to predict back in June that the Bank would loosen monetary policy further at its November meeting. By announcing an extra \u00a3150bn today, the MPC didn\u2019t disappoint as that was slightly greater than our forecast of \u00a3100bn. And this extra QE is unlikely to be the last expansion. We think the MPC will announce at least \u00a3100bn more QE in 2021, more than the consensus currently expects. Why? Because the Bank\u2019s forecasts look a little too upbeat, she argues: The MPC kept its dovish language in the minutes, reiterating the downside risks to its GDP forecasts noting that the \u201crecovery would take time, and the risks around the GDP projection were judged to be skewed to the downside\u201d. And it also said \u201cthe risk of more persistent period of elevated unemployment remained material\u201d and that if the outlook for inflation weakens, the Committee stood ready to take \u201cwhatever additional action was necessary to achieve its remit\u201d. What\u2019s more, the Bank\u2019s GDP and inflation forecasts still look a bit too optimistic to us. Our view is that inflation will be closer to 1.5% by the end of 2022. That\u2019s why we believe the Bank will still have to increase its policy support. Supermarket chain Sainsbury has highlighted the impact of Covid-19 on the economy, by outlining plans to cut up to 3,500 jobs. The group is closing most of its standalone Argos outlets (in favour of collection points and sites within its supermarkets), and also shuttering its meat, fish and deli counters, My colleague Sarah Butler has the details: Up to 3,500 jobs are at risk at Sainsbury\u2019s as the supermarket closes more than 400 standalone Argos stores and cuts all meat, fish and deli counters. The supermarket said about 150 Argos stores would be moved into its supermarkets to crack down on costs. The changes come as Sainsbury\u2019s said 40% of its sales were now online \u2013 compared with 19% a year ago. The company said it aimed to find new roles for all the staff affected and it would boost the overall number of people it employed by 6,000 by March. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s said: \u201cCovid-19 has accelerated a number of shifts in our industry. Investments over recent years in digital and technology have laid the foundations for us to flex and adapt quickly as customers needed to shop differently.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s hopes to find jobs for the 3,5000 people affected -- and is aiming to grow its workforce by 6,000 this financial year. But those new jobs might not suit someone whose losing their role in Argos or on the deli counter, of course (depending on skill set, location, working hours...) On the counter closures, Sainsbury\u2019s explains: We closed our meat, fish and delicatessen counters in March as we focused all our efforts on feeding the nation. Customers have told us they are happy buying these products in the aisle. We have therefore decided to close permanently our meat, fish and delicatessen counters. Our pizza and patisserie counters remain open and we continue to freshly bake bread in 1,348 stores Reuters is reporting that the Bank of England will \u2018look into\u2019 how its \u00a3150bn QE expansion - larger than the City expected - was reported in today\u2019s Sun newspaper, and online last night. Here\u2019s their story: Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said he would look into how The Sun newspaper was able to report that the central bank would expand its asset purchase programme by 150 billion pounds ($196 billion), hours before it was officially announced. Leaks of BoE policy decisions are almost unheard of, but a series of government decisions on COVID measures, including economic support, have been reported in British newspapers ahead of their official announcement. \u201cYes, we will look into it,\u201d Bailey told reporters when asked about the Sun report in a news conference after the BoE had officially announced the quantitative easing decision. In a report first published online around 2130 GMT, The Sun said that unspecified sources had told it the BoE\u2019s stimulus would be larger than the 100 billion pounds largely expected by economists and was \u201clikely to be around 150 billion pounds\u201d. The same article also said finance minister Rishi Sunak would broaden job furlough support in a statement to parliament also due on Thursday. Before the announcement of the BoE decision at 0700 GMT, only the central bank and Britain\u2019s finance ministry would officially have known the decision. A finance ministry representative sits in on deliberations of the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, and Sunak must formally approve expanded asset purchases. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at brokers CMC Markets, said the apparent leak was \u201cextremely concerning\u201d and that there needed to be a full inquiry. \u201cThese policy decisions are important macroeconomic events, and given the Bank of England also acts as a regulator, it\u2019s bang out of order,\u201d he said. Last month Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority concluded there had been no misconduct when a company contracted by the BoE to help provide video feeds of its public news conferences also sold traders slightly faster audio of the same event. The BoE said its staff should have spotted what it viewed as misuse of its broadcast feeds sooner, and barred the business from working with it in future. And here\u2019s a tweet of the story from last night: The BoE\u2019s latest Monetary Policy report, which outline its latest growth and inflation forecasts, is online here. The minutes of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting, where it voted to increase QE by \u00a3150bn, are here. Today\u2019s QE expansion shows that the Bank - and the Treasury - are firmly in damage limitation mode, writes our Larry Elliott: Back in August the Bank of England was relatively chipper about the economy. It was the month of \u201cEat out to help out\u201d, sectors that had been locked down as a result of the pandemic were opening up and growth was exceeding expectations. Three months on, the outlook \u2013 courtesy of a second wave of Covid-19 \u2013 has become much darker. Instead of the 5.5% economic expansion it had been pencilling in for the final three months of 2020 Threadneedle Street is assuming a 2% decline. That\u2019s a much smaller fall than the 20% contraction in the spring, but as the Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, pointed out, the economy is already 9% smaller than it was at the end of last year. A 2% drop still represents a chunky fall: the 11% cumulative decline over the course of 2020 is double that seen during the financial crisis of 2008-09. Today\u2019s decision to expand its stimulus by \u00a3150bn means the Bank of England has roughly doubled its QE programme this year. Back in March, the BoE boosted the package by \u00a3200bn to \u00a3645bn after global stock markets crashed as the Covid-19 pandemic began to sweep the globe. It then added another \u00a3100bn in June, amid concern that UK unemployment would rise sharply, particularly in hospitality. The Bank uses this nearly created money in its asset purchase scheme, buying UK government bonds (gilts) from commercial banks. (it is now planning to increase its UK gilts holdings to \u00a3875bn, and also keep holding \u00a320bn of corporate debt). The idea is to drive down borrowing costs, encouraging bank lending, stimulating economic growth and protecting jobs at a time when interest rates are already at record lows (0.1%). Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, points out that the current ultraloose monetary policy is a blow to cash savers: This is all terrible news for cash savers, who have endured more than ten years of ultra low interest rates. \u00a3210 billion now sits in cash accounts that don\u2019t pay any interest, up from \u00a326 billion in 2008. A further \u00a3837 billion is held in accounts paying on average 0.13%. \u201cThis money is slowly but surely losing its buying power, even though inflation is currently so low. That won\u2019t be the case for too long, as inflation is expected to move back towards 2% in the first half of next year as lower energy prices fall out of the equation. The Bank of England is predicting that the UK will suffer a much deeper Covid-19 recession than the US or the eurozone. While UK GDP is now forecast to shrink by 11% this year, US GDP is only expected to fall by 3.75% while the eurozone faces a 6.75% contraction. The global economy is seen shrinking by around 5%, as this chart shows: The UK has a large services sector, and a strong reliance on consumer spending. So lockdown measures and physical distancing rules clearly hit those parts of the economy. But.... with England and Wales suffering among the highest per capita death tolls of the coronavirus pandemic among industrialised nations, the UK hasn\u2019t done well on either the \u2018health\u2019 or \u2018wealth\u2019 measure. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston tweets that this raises \u2018big questions\u2019 over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic: Here\u2019s ITV\u2019s Joel Hills on the Bank\u2019s new forecasts: [that furlough extension is why the unemployment peak has been pushed back to next summer] Today\u2019s Bank of England forecasts show that hopes of a V-shaped recovery have fizzled out. Back in June, chief economist Andy Haldane said the recovery looked to be \u2018so far, so V\u2019, with economic growth rebounding faster than expected. Not any more -- the new forecasts look much more like a W, with a double-dip contraction this quarter and a slower recovery: Here\u2019s James Smith of Resolution Foundation\u2019s take: On Brexit, this chart from the BoE shows that a third of UK firms say they\u2019re only partly prepared for new trading arrangements. But....the share of partially prepared firms tends to be higher in sectors where a relatively large proportion of firms trades directly with the EU. The Bank explains: For example, over 40% of businesses in the wholesale and retail, manufacturing, and transport and storage sectors report that they are partially prepared for the end of the transition period, or not at all. Fewer businesses report that they are partially prepared in the accommodation and food services and construction sectors, where a higher share of firms do not trade with the EU. The Bank has also warned that disruption caused by a significant minority of firms not being ready for Brexit will shave 1% off growth in the first quarter next year. The problem is that exports will be turned away at the border because of a lack of correct documentation, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. In today\u2019s Monetary Policy report, the Bank predicts that trade will suffer as businesses adjust to new arrangements. Its central projections assume that a free trade agreement is reached between the UK and EU before the end of 2020, but that trade and GDP are temporarily lower in the near term as firms adjust to the new arrangements. The Report says: Recent evidence from the Bank\u2019s Agents and a range of business surveys and intelligence suggests that while some businesses feel prepared for the change in trading arrangements, others \u2014 particularly smaller firms \u2014 reported that they were not fully prepared, with Covid having hampered some preparations. In particular, while the UK will phase in checks at the border, the EU has stated it will apply full border controls from 1 January 2021, which some businesses are initially unlikely to be fully prepared for. Reflecting this evidence, in its central forecast, the MPC assumes that traders representing around 70% of goods exports to the EU are prepared for customs and documentation checks at the border by the end of the year. This is assumed to weigh further on UK exports in the near term. Due to the integrated nature of cross-border supply chains and logistics, imports are also likely to be affected, albeit to a lesser degree. In the central projection, the expected reduction in exports, and the impact on domestic supply chains, reduces projected GDP directly by around 1% in 2021 Q1. That is assumed to reflect a reduction in supply as well as demand. These effects on trade are assumed to be temporary and to unwind over the course of six months, as businesses adjust. The BoE is now predicting that the UK economy will shrink by 11% this year -- including a 2% contraction in October-December. That\u2019s based on the assumption that the various lockdowns imposed this autumn end as planned, and that previous restrictions remain in place until the end of the first quarter of 2021. The Bank explains: Those restrictions include heightened England-wide measures for the period 5 November to 2 December, following an intensification of regional and subregional tiered restrictions; the five-level system of restrictions announced by the Scottish Government that came in on 2 November; the firebreak lockdown in Wales scheduled to end on 9 November, after just over two weeks; and a four-week period of additional restrictions in Northern Ireland ending on 13 November. Subsequently, restrictions are assumed to loosen somewhat. For the UK as a whole, the average level of restrictions that was prevailing in mid-October is assumed to take effect, and remain in place until the end of 2021 Q1. And here\u2019s economist Julian Jessop on the Bank\u2019s new unemployment forecasts: Actually... on unemployment the Bank seems to have pushed back its forecast for the peak, due to the recent job retention measures taken by the government. Today\u2019s forecasts now show unemployment at around 6.25% at the end of this year, down from 7.5% expected three months ago. But, unemployment is then expected to rise to 7.75% by the middle of 2021, as explained: As the FT puts it: With the furlough scheme having been reinstated, the MPC expected unemployment to remain significantly lower than its forecast from September, but still rise from the current 4.5 per cent rate to 7.75 per cent by next summer. As a result, the Bank\u2019s forecasts for unemployment in 2021 are now higher: The Bank has also changed its UK unemployment forecast. With the economy expected to shrink again in Q4, it now predicts the jobless rate will peak at 7.75% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 4.5% today (that would be the highest since 2013, according to ONS data). Back in August, the BoE has expected unemployment to hit 7.5% at the end of this year, before then starting to decline gradually. In today\u2019s Monetary Policy Report, the BoE says: In the MPC\u2019s central projection, GDP does not exceed its level in 2019 Q4 until 2022 Q1. As a result, unemployment is elevated. The unemployment rate is projected to peak at around 7\u00be% in 2021 Q2, before declining gradually over the forecast period as GDP picks up. This fan chart shows the Bank\u2019s forecasts (the darker areas indicate higher probability). The BoE now expects that the UK economy won\u2019t return to its pre-pandemic size until the first quarter of 2022. That\u2019s a downgrade - previously, the BoE had expected the recovery be complete by the end of next year. This chart, from the BoE, shows how it expects the economy to contract in the current quarter. That\u2019s due to the Covid-19 lockdown, as well as the slowdown in global growth, the BoE says: Informed by recent movements in high-frequency indicators of activity and announcements about Covid-related restrictions, UK GDP is projected to fall in Q4. That largely reflects lower consumer spending on social activities, which is assumed to be partially offset by higher spending on other goods and services. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We start with some breaking news: The Bank of England has boosted its quantitative easing stimulus package by \u00a3150bn, as policymakers try to protect the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. The Bank warned that the new restrictions imposed to combat Covid-19 mean the UK economy will shrink in the current quarter. That means Britain would suffer a double-dip downturn this year. There are signs that consumer spending has softened across a range of high-frequency indicators, while investment intentions have remained weak... Developments related to Covid will weigh on near-term spending to a greater extent than projected in the August Report, leading to a decline in GDP in 2020 Q4. The expansion of the Bank\u2019s asset purchase scheme is bigger than economists expected, and has been announced as the England\u2019s second coronavirus lockdown begins. The Bank also predicts that household spending and GDP will rise in the first quarter of next year, but cautions that activity will still be \u201cmaterially lower\u201d than in the last quarter of 2019. Today\u2019s announcement makes it clear that the BoE expects a long haul: Over the remainder of the forecast period, GDP is projected to recover further as the direct impact of Covid on the economy is assumed to wane. Activity is also supported by the substantial fiscal policies already announced and accommodative monetary policy. The recovery takes time, however, and the risks around the GDP projection are judged to be skewed to the downside. The BoE is also leaving UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.1%. This fresh injection of QE will boost the Bank\u2019s total package to \u00a3895bn - used to buy \u00a3875bn of government bonds (plus \u00a320bn of corporate debt). The Bank\u2019s move is the first part of a double-header from policymakers, with the government due to lay out new support later today. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Rishi Sunak is expected to announce an extension of furlough beyond December amid growing pressure from business leaders to safeguard jobs and the economy during the coronavirus second wave. The chancellor is preparing to announce that the flagship wage subsidy scheme \u2013 which pays 80% of workers\u2019 wages \u2013 will continue to be made available for parts of the country under the highest levels of Covid restrictions, sources said, in a major climbdown for the government.
