When Guardian journalist Joseph Harker opened the bill from Virgin Media for his 15-year-old son's mobile he was shocked to see his son had been spending around \u00a3100 a month since July, including one bill of \u00a3188. \"I'd taken out a monthly plan costing \u00a312 a month so I was surprised to see such hefty charges,\" Harker says. \"When I asked him, I found out he had met a girl and they had been texting madly. Virgin have been sending him texts about the charges but he just ignored them. There was no other information sent \u2013 no letter to me, no email, nothing.\" When Harker called Virgin Media, he was told there was nothing they could do and they would not refund any of the costs. \"I accept the bill is correct: his deal was for 250 texts a month, which we thought was more than enough. But given that something's clearly gone wayward I feel strongly that Virgin should have alerted me, the bill payer. It's obvious no one in their right mind would rack up these costs instead of just switching to a cheaper plan for unlimited texts.\" A Virgin Media spokeswoman said customers can view their bills for free online at any time. \"As long as the email address the bill is sent to belongs to the parents, they can view the bill whenever they like,\" she says. \"In addition, anyone can check their phone's remaining allowances or their current balance for free at any time by dialling 789 from their handset. We have also developed our My Account app which customers can download directly to their smartphones to keep track of how many minutes, mobile web and texts they have left.\" She said Virgin Media also allows customers to use a credit limit system which sends a text message when they reach 75% and 90% of their usage and suspends the service when they reach 105%, although time and billing lags do not make this fail-safe. Dominic Baliszewski of Mobilechoices.co.uk says PAYG deals offer parents \"peace of mind if they don't trust their kids to stick to a clear limit on monthly calls and texts\". Three's Chris Semple agrees: \"The best thing a parent can do to control their kids' spending is choose a PAYG account \u2013 it's really the only fail-safe way of ensuring they do not over-spend.\" Parents have to pay for the cost of a phone upfront with PAYG. However, the system can prove a useful teaching aid, allowing children to learn about their usage and what it all costs. But many parents worry their children could end up stranded without the means to make contact. An Orange spokesman says: \"We know mobile phones offer a lifeline to parents who want to give their kids freedom and are looking for the peace of mind of knowing they're only a phone call away. However, we also know parents are often concerned about the potential costs involved, which is why we offer them a number of tools and controls which may be useful.\" Orange offers Reserve tank, which provides a \u00a32.50 credit buffer, giving younger users credit even when they run out, and Tiny Top Ups, from as little 10p, which helps with budgeting. Vodafone's IOU service lends customers \u00a32 of emergency credit which is deducted from their next top-up, while a service called \"0800 MUMDAD\" (08000 686 323) lets children make reverse-charge calls to other mobiles in the UK. For parents of children on PAYG deals who are fed up with constant pestering for top-ups and credit, Baliszewski says a contract can still be good value, but only if parents take into account data allowance, contract length, options to cap usage and insurance cover to ensure a Christmas gift doesn't keep costing them money. \"If your child is old enough to understand and stick to clearly defined usage limits, contract deals can be great value as they offer generous call, text and data allowances as well as a free handset,\" Baliszewski says. \"But do bear in mind that you will most likely be tied in to a contract for at least 18 months, with your child hinting for the latest phone deal long before this time is up.\" He adds that one option to consider is the 12-month T-Mobile You Fix plan, which costs \u00a315.50 a month but allows you to choose \"boosters\" to add on if the call/text/data limit is not enough. \"Boosters are a handy feature as although your child may be using the phone, you will be held liable for any additional costs they rack up.\" If your network offers a capped deal, use it. \"If they run out before the end of the month they will have the option to top up their account themselves, so you won't get any nasty surprises when you get the bill. Speaking to your chosen mobile network before giving the phone to your child should let you put caps in place,\" Baliszewski says. For text-mad teenagers, he rates Tesco Mobile's 12-month \u00a315 a month tariff which offers 5,000 texts and 250 minutes \u2013 making a first-year cost of \u00a3180. For chatterboxes, he favours an O2 two-year tariff at \u00a326 a month, offering 600 minutes and unlimited texts. For rampant data downloaders, he recommends Three Mobile's All-in-One 15 tariff, a PAYG deal (with a Samsung Galaxy Europa phone), which offers 300 minutes and 3,000 texts for \u00a315 a month, though the handset costs \u00a349.99. Insurance might be useful, but check whether your home contents policy already covers mobile phones and, if not, whether you can add them to the policy at a lower cost than taking out stand-alone mobile phone cover. Unfortunately, Harker will have to pay his son's bill. \"The onus is on the bill payer to check it regularly,\" the Virgin Media spokeswoman says. \"Mr Harker's son massively exceeded his limit of 250 texts, sometimes sending up to 1,300 a month. We do sympathise and will do our utmost to help him pay this bill.\" Parental controls Parents need to consider the online content their child may be accessing through their phone and take necessary steps to protect them. Most mobile phones can now play music, take and receive pictures and even download/upload videos \u2013 but many come with filtering software included so that children won't access inappropriate websites or content (check before you buy). Orange pay as you go and pay monthly users, for example, have Orange Safeguard available to them which prevents the user from viewing over-18s content on mobile internet. There are also a wide range of apps to lock out certain websites. Parents should also teach their children about premium-rate numbers, viruses, spam mail and texts and how to block their phones. Advice on mobile phones from ChatDanger.com states children should: \u2022 Only give mobile numbers to people they already know and trust. \u2022 Respect their friends' privacy and not give out their numbers without their permission. \u2022 Consider blocking other users. \u2022 Get friends' permission before taking pictures of them, and especially before sending pictures to someone else or to the Internet. \u2022 Never reply to text messages from people they don't know. This includes spam.
