The first was Anne Enright, whose novel The Pleasure of Eliza Lynch was published last autumn. Now come two biographies. The Shadows of Elisa Lynch is Si\u00e2n Rees's second book, The Empress of South America is Nigel Cawthorne's 32nd; both seem to have been written at lightning speed, their previous publications being still hot off the press. One has to suppose that Rees and Cawthorne, having patiently shared library resources and taken turns to look over the archives in Asuncion, were determined to beat one another to the post. In his haste, some few errors have found their way into Cawthorne's text but these are soon forgotten in the galloping pace of his prose. Of the two books, Cawthorne's is less putdownable although the absence of footnotes or references makes it frustrating. His is an unforgiving and furious account of the events that took place in Paraguay between 1855 (when Francisco Solano Lopez, son of the Paraguayan dictator, returned from a visit to Europe accompanied by a mysterious and very pregnant Irish courtesan) and 1870, when the dazzling Elisa Lynch at last left the country, following the murders of Lopez and the son she had been carrying. As the lover of Lopez, soon to become Marshal President, the self-styled \"Madame\" Lynch determined to transform the state's dusty capital into an imperial city and herself into its empress. She thus began an extensive building programme of opera houses and palaces, which either remained unfinished or were never inhabited. During the 15 years that she was a guest of Paraguay, whose history had been \"a terrible and bloody farce\" even before her appearance, she presided over the deaths of one million of the republic's citizens, acquired at scandalously low prices more than 32 million hectares of its land, looted its women of their jewels, and smuggled into European bank accounts many thousands of pounds' worth of Paraguayan gold. Lopez, a psychopathic, lecherous and ugly little drunk who modeled himself on Napoleon III, began his rule by declaring a suicidal war on all other South American states, and while his skeletal and naked soldiers, thousands of whom were children, lay dying, Madame Lynch, plump on French dinners, toured the camps in her silks and finery with her grand piano in tow. Having destroyed the economy and population of his country - it would take three generations to repopulate Paraguay - Lopez began his real campaign of terror. Convinced of a conspiracy to overthrow him, he ordered the torture and murder of those who were unfortunate enough to be still alive. Lopez was, at least, egalitarian, and included among his victims his brothers, sisters and brothers-in-law. Shortly before his own death, he ordered the assassination of his mother. Rees's version of events has less fire than Cawthorne's. She tries to make sense of Lopez, believing, unlike Cawthorne, that the conspiracies against him were real and that he therefore had some reason to his actions. \"Sincerity looms through the horror,\" she says of the general's command that thousands of his people be flogged until their skin hung off them before being fettered and chained and forced to confess to crimes they did not commit. And there is her occassional attempt, albeit frail, to apologise for the actions of Elisa Lynch, the defence being that she lived in fear of Lopez too. Having tried to humanise them, The Shadows of Elisa Lynch needs a satisfactory analysis of the dynamic between the couple who found in one another a match for their own sadism and greed. But what interests Rees more than human relationships is the relationship between people and landscape, and these more elemental ties are given a central position in her tale. Rees's strength as a writer lies, as it did in her earlier book, The Floating Brothel, in her astonishing eye for physical detail and her vivid and evocative reconstruction of physical suffering. Her account of the war, which takes up the bulk of her narrative, is painstakingly realised and brilliantly dramatised. What fascinates both writers is the subsequent mythologisation of Elisa Lynch, her apparently seamless shift from tyrant to patriotic martyr. A century after leaving the wreckage of Paraguay, Lynch was proclaimed its national heroine - \"surpassed by none in her courage, her self-lessness, and her loyalty\" - and her body removed from its plot in the Parisian graveyard where she lay and returned, in a bronze urn wrapped in the tricolour, to her adopted country. Which only goes to show, as Cawthorne puts it, that you can fall in a sewer and still come up smelling of roses. \u00b7 Frances Wilson is writing a biography of the Regency courtesan Harriette Wilson"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
