Wayne Rooney was bearing down menacingly on the left of Manchester United's attack, indicating to Dimitar Berbatov precisely where he wanted the ball. His wish was Berbatov's command. The ball arrived, Rooney cut inside his marker and thumped a low right-foot shot into the corner. One-nil. The only thing that makes this goal unusual is its uniqueness. It is the one and only time Berbatov and Rooney have combined directly to score all season: the first goal in a 4\u20130 rout of West Bromwich Albion at Old Trafford on 18 October. The strike partnership Sir Alex Ferguson put together in the belief it would be the most feared in the country has started 19 games now, with another nine matches when one or the other has come off the bench, and that is all the pair have managed to create between themselves \u2013 one measly goal against the most porous defence in England's top division. As statistics go, it is an alarming one for Ferguson to consider as he and his players fly to Portugal this morning for the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Porto tomorrow. When Ferguson signed Berbatov on transfer-deadline day last September, he had anticipated the \u00a330.75m recruit replicating the kind of combination play with Rooney that made the Bulgarian's on-field relationship with Robbie Keane so formidable during their two seasons together at Tottenham Hotspur. Ferguson, having tried to sign Berbatov on at least three previous occasions, had no time for those who questioned whether Berbatov and Rooney might be too similar, both spending much of their time outside the opposition penalty area, both having a natural desire to roam to different areas of the pitch. As a partnership, however, even Ferguson, a fierce protector of his own, may struggle to argue that the pair have hit it off as he had hoped. Rooney has not set up one of Berbatov's 13 goals; the Bulgarian has not been involved in 16 of Rooney's 17. To put it into context, Berbatov and Keane linked up directly for eight goals in their first season at Tottenham. If, at United, the Rooney-Berbatov partnership is often broken up by Carlos Tevez or others, it was a similar story at White Hart Lane, with Jermain Defoe and Mido challenging Berbatov and Keane. The scorer of 27 goals last season, Berbatov has shown, in flashes, the kind of sublime exhibitionist skill that made Ferguson's desire to sign him border on obsessive \u2013 but only in flashes. There was the brilliance with which Berbatov deceived West Ham's James Collins to set up Cristiano Ronaldo in a 2-0 win at Old Trafford last October. But then consider the 2-0 defeat at Fulham, when he made only six passes in the first 45 minutes. His form has become a subject of intense debate: is it a coincidence that in his first season at Old Trafford United are unlikely to finish as the Premier League's leading scorers for the first time in four seasons? They have 54 goals, five fewer than Liverpool, one below Chelsea and the same as fourth-placed Arsenal. With a game in hand, they may yet claw that back. But it is unlikely they will get close to the 80 scored last season, the 83 in 2006-07 or the 72 of 2005-06. Rooney currently has nine league goals and Berbatov eight. The problem is one of positioning. Neither player is an orthodox centre-forward. Rooney can frequently be seen charging back to help out his left-back or popping up in the centre-circle. Berbatov, too, likes to drop back and instigate play. Each player needs someone to play in front of him but neither wants to be that man. The scrutiny of Berbatov intrigues Ferguson. \"You know it's interesting \u2013 maybe what they're saying is he's not sprinting full out 40 yards all the time all over the place in the way, say, Rooney does or Tevez does. I can understand people saying that because he's a very economic player. He's like Teddy Sheringham in that way. He drifts into spaces, his movement is off the ball but, when you actually do the statistics, he is as high as anyone in the team. \"He is different from most players, yes. He is very economic in his use of sprinting, but his pace is very good, he's got wonderful balance, he's got great vision.\" Ferguson, however, could be forgiven if he sees Fernando Torres banging them in for Liverpool and wonders whether, for once, his judgment has let him down. Rooney is at his best playing just behind a more advanced forward and one can only imagine the results had United been successful in attempts to sign Torres from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2005 and 2006. The clubs could not agree a fee and, in the end, Ferguson decided to look elsewhere, explaining that he was not too bothered because, in his mind, Torres was not composed enough in front of goal. It is what Homer Simpson would call a \"D'oh!\" moment. Although United played 551 successful passes against Sunderland in December, their highest total since the 2006-07 season, only four were played between the front too. Here you can see Rooney's passes to No9 Berbatov. Both of them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
