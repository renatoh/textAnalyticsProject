Like schoolchildren enthused with learning, hands straining high in the air and desperate to tell teacher the answer first, they long to tell any audience that will listen about their findings and the stunning research gems they have unearthed. Research-TV, a non-profit-making broadcasting initiative led by the University of Warwick, could help spread those findings far wider than any spiel at a conference. It aims to revolutionise the communication of science to the public - a government imperative - and even to win researchers pots of money to commercialise their ideas. Warwick has a broadcast studio on campus and reached an audience of 150 million worldwide with a video news release of Bill Clinton's last presidential speech on globalisation, given at the university in December 2000. From this, the idea grew to set up a pilot to test the potential impact of similar video releases to broadcast research news worldwide. The pilot was launched in spring last year. Initially, a number of UK universities, along with the Economic and Social Research Council and the Regional Development Agency, were involved. And they found a receptive audience: some 250 million people, among them international opinion leaders, busi ness executives, senior academics, policymakers and the public at large. Research-TV takes expert opinion on topical issues, new discoveries, newsworthy or unusual research and tailors it into a piece that can be used by news broadcasters. The cost of the package - roughly \u00a38,000 - covers all elements of producing and distributing a television clip. Institutions using the service get a breakdown of how many broadcasters use the footage as well as monitoring reports. They are then free to use the footage for their own purposes, such as corporate videos or presentations. After the success of the pilot, Research-TV was launched in January this year with a smaller core of partners, made up of the universities of Birmingham, Durham, King's College London, Nottingham and Warwick, which has overall responsibility for the project. It has been providing newsrooms with research feeds on a fortnightly basis ever since. \"As a university doing world-class research, Durham has found that Research-TV is proving to be an excellent vehicle for raising awareness of the quality and breadth of our work,\" says Keith Seacroft, head of public relations at the university. \"The stories featured so far on nanotechnology, astronomy and plasma chemistry have been broadcast across the globe, giving us a real opportunity to enhance the reputation of our institution worldwide.\" It allows universities to spread their research further, explains Chris Coe, director of communications at King's. \"New technology provides an international platform for news stories and Research-TV has made use of this to allow us to publicise some of our research to a truly global audience. I guess it reaches parts that traditional PR doesn't reach.\" Others are more doubtful - Judith Moore, University College London's media relations manager, for one. \"I'd be quite doubtful about how effective it would be,\" she says. \"Most broadcasters want to send along their own cameramen to get the shots that they want. In putting together a broadcast release, you are presenting a picture that they themselves might not want to paint.\" Often TV producers put together a news broadcast using generic shots of laboratories, for example, on top of the interviews, rather than spend precious time filming a complete package. For Moore, the Research-TV process sounds too controlling. \"Something a PR agency might do for a drugs company,\" she suggests. Not to mention expensive: \"[\u00a38,000] is a massive outlay for any press office and I think there are other, better avenues that reach more people.\" But supporters point to notable successes, such as the mass exposure of research findings from the University of Nottingham. The English Place-Name Society, a research group founded in 1923, is a long-standing project at the university, which aims to explain the origin and development of all the place names in England. JRR Tolkien was an active member of the society and his books drew heavily on Anglo-Saxon and Celtic languages for the names of places and characters. The timing of the release of this research story coincided nicely with the premiere of the third film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy last year. Newsrooms around the world, thirsty for unusual news features connected with the film, snapped up the reel, and thousands of viewers saw research that might otherwise have been lost to the wider public. What lies in store for the initiative? Ian Rowley, Warwick's communications director, says more emphasis on science is likely. One idea is to develop a communications platform that will promote public awareness of science using television and the internet. According to Rowley, the concept should also expand in line with the increasing onus placed on institutions to disseminate their research, and the university is considering increasing the number of core partners. An interactive channel to showcase technologies awaiting commercialisation to a global audience is planned later this year - which will create an online community of researchers, business, financial investors and venture capitalists. A video to back up the value of research could make it easier to persuade venture capitalists to invest in an idea when it comes to commercialising it. www.research-tv.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
