He perhaps preferred to save his ink for national occasions that are a bit more pinned-down. This enraged some Brexiters to the point that they regrettably decided to pen their own attempts, with the Spectator\u2019s blog even promising to publish the best. I found revisiting the deathless verse of Brexit party MEP Lance Forman particularly pleasing on Thursday, as the light poured in from the window overlooking my garden which, like the rest of the nation, remained resolutely part of the European Union: \u201cOctober 31st / Is when we burst / Out of the EU\u2019s grip / No ifs. No buts / No backstop cuts / We leave the sinking ship\u201d. When Brexit will happen is anyone\u2019s guess, but we can certainly have a stab at how Armitage feels about it, because he made a Brexit-themed film poem for Sky Arts. In it, he describes Kent as \u201cexposing its fat little cock to the east\u201d, which I think is rather good. I myself have had a mistrust of jingoistic verse since our English teacher used Roger McGough\u2019s poem Why Patriots are a Bit Nuts in the Head, from the summer 1967 issue of International Socialism, as one of the counterpoints to Rupert Brooke\u2019s snivelling ethnocentricity in The Soldier (\u201cIf I should die, think only this of me: / That there\u2019s some corner of a foreign field / That is for ever England\u201d). When it comes to state-of-the-nation poetry, I find ambivalence much more appealing. I\u2019ve sought much consolation in poetry recently. It can illuminate where political commentary sometimes falls short. It examines with precision while screaming tabloid headlines cite unnamed sources without question. It aids empathy, and distils emotions in ways that vividly encapsulate a moment in time. When I read Vidyan Ravinthiran\u2019s TS Eliot prize-shortlisted The Million-Petalled Flower of Being Here, a book of sonnets for his wife, I gain a glimpse of the life of a mixed-race couple living in the north, and how it must have felt on that day in 2016, standing at Durham station. \u201cWe glance from face to face / guess how each voted,\u201d he writes, in the poem Brexit, before saying that, \u201cIt seems to me my Facebook friends down south are mad / at finding themselves, all of a sudden, a minority / in their own country\u201d. The morning after the referendum, I awoke to the sound of a woman hollering, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken our country back!\u201d That evening, the poet Anthony Anaxagorou was in an Uber, though there is nothing in his poem of the same title \u2013 from the collection After the Formalities \u2013 itself to suggest the day, we learn it in a footnote. He writes: \u201cto our right / a van pulls up / two men / motion / to lower / windows / in rain / he does / we do / go home / home / go home / laughing / up / a storm / front\u201d. In a 2017 special issue of Poem, edited by Fiona Sampson, Mona Arshi and Aisha Gill, collecting women\u2019s responses to Brexit, I read in One of Every Two how Nazneen Ahmed felt: \u201cI step onto the bus more warily today. I keep my head down. I feel my heart beating double time in my chest.\u201d Poetry sales have been booming of late, aided by new audiences offered up by the internet and its shareability through social media platforms. Small presses are flourishing, spoken-word poetry can go viral. The uncertain times in which we live must surely also be a factor in poetry\u2019s newfound popularity. The Midlands-based poet Jane Commane\u2019s collection, Assembly Lines, tells of life in the post-industrial towns of the Midlands, those so-called left-behind communities. Her poem UnWeather is a response to the referendum result, about language and its origins, how it pilfers and overlaps, \u201cmackled together with flints and flaps\u201d. \u201cEach leaf of English borrowed from / a starry European library of tongues, / library card now revoked,\u201d she writes. \u201cPoetry seemed the only way to explore and comprehend the complexity of Brexit and the referendum result \u2013 but also to process some of the emotions around it \u2013 fear, anger, grief,\u201d Commane tells me. \u201cPoetry is a way of working things out and, because it can contain the kind of contradictions and multiplicities that our more oppositional political and social discourses often can\u2019t, with their binary choices of yes/no, for/against, leave/remain, it\u2019s also space in which language helps us to find a form of truth for ourselves; a way of naming and containing what often feels uncontainable or incomprehensible.\u201d The Brexit debate is one in which we are again and again presented with apparently simple narratives, easy answers to a complex problem. Yet poetry offers no such easy answers, and perhaps slightly paradoxically, that\u2019s why it can be comforting. As Commane suggests, it\u2019s a way of processing, even if we never come to a clear conclusion. In a polemical climate, this is especially appealing. Of course, there is pleasure and catharsis to be found in defiantly political poetry, too, such as Luke Wright\u2019s The Panel, a blistering diatribe written in 2014 that foreshadows Brexit with furious accuracy, or Hollie McNish\u2019s Mathematics. Spoken-word poetry lends itself well to politics, and the anger of it can be cathartic. Indeed, a mass sort of catharsis took place at Glastonbury in 2017, when Kate Tempest performed People\u2019s Faces and audience members were moved to tears. \u201cWas that a pivotal historical moment we just went stumbling past? / Well, here we are, dancing in the rumbling dark,\u201d says Tempest. But there is hope there: \u201cI can feel things changing / Even when I\u2019m weak and I\u2019m breaking\u201d. It\u2019s nearly three and a half years since the referendum on leaving the EU. In that time there has been so much poetry written as a real-time response to breaking news \u2013 the website New Boots and Pantisocracies and Nick Asbury\u2019s Realtime Notes being just two examples of this poem-a-day method. From The Brexit Book of the Dead by Rishi Dastidar to Over Seas, by Ed Lvker, and Great again, our island nation, by Martha Sprackland, Brexit has seen responses by poets from a variety of backgrounds and walks of life, from all over the country and beyond. In her poem, Sprackland writes that \u201cthe pound slumps like a drunk. I\u2019m scared of division, scared of men\u201d. I\u2019ve felt that fear, many of us have, but poetry can be a kind of antidote. \u201cThe country\u2019s / lonely with itself and howls / for something, like a dog gone old / in the head,\u201d writes David Clarke in The Vision of Albion. Poetry is not the solution to that howl, but it helps. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 because an earlier version credited only one of the three editors of a 2017 special issue of Poem.
