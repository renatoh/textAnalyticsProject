Russell Coutts, who won the Finn gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics before dominating the America's Cup, pronounced himself impressed after watching the British world champion revel in the strong winds and big waves to deliver a storming fourth place and then a victory in yesterday's two races. \"Everyone talks about his downwind performance, and downwind he is dynamic,\" the New Zealander said, \"but today he made two fantastic starts, he tacks the boat perfectly each time and sails upwind better than them all.\" In the morning race Ainslie, along with most of the better skippers, went to the right on the first leg but a huge windshift favoured those on the left. He rounded the first mark in 10th position some 2 minutes down on the leader but clawed his way up the fleet. Such was his relentless charge that he snatched fourth place within feet of the finishing line, overtaking Alejandro Colla. Ainslie, the Laser gold medallist in Sydney, was 4sec behind the Argentinian at the final turn but refused to settle for what he had over the last 200 metres. The second race of the day was an Ainslie classic. His main rival, Mateusz Kusznierewicz of Poland, went early and was subsequently disqualified, while the Briton tacked into clear air right off the line and trailed Ireland's David Burrows by 19sec at the first mark, closed to 8sec by the next and overtook the Irishman downwind before pulling away to a handsome victory. With more than 20 knots of wind all day, it was also an exhausting win. \"I'm knackered,\" he said. \"My body feels like a bit of a wreck, but I guess everybody else's does as well.\" There are still five races to go and Ainslie, allowed to discard only one result, cannot afford to relax his grip after the loss of yesterday's appeal against what the British felt was a dubious disqualification in Saturday's second race for a right-of-way incident with France's Guillaume Florent. Team GB had secured BBC video footage which Ainslie believed proved his innocence. But with Ainslie now one point ahead of his training partner, Rafael Trujillo of Spain, with Kusznierewicz nine points back in third, losing the appeal was one of the few low points of a day that saw Britons leading three classes after three days. Another Sydney gold medallist, Shirley Robertson, and her team of Sarahs, Ayton and Webb, built on their overnight lead in the Yngling class. Their nine-point lead with five races to go means they can afford one disaster and still win gold. In the day's first race they were edged out of third and needed to produce a comeback in the second. \"We had to tack off the start line - and into the wrong windshift,\" Webb explained. \"We were last.\" At the finish they had gained a full minute on the Norwegian leaders to claim third. Robertson is pushing her 21-foot keelboat harder than most and using techniques from her dinghy days in this new class. Normally keelboats are steered in a straight line but a dinghy sailor will follow the waves more, as Robertson has been doing here, particularly downwind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
