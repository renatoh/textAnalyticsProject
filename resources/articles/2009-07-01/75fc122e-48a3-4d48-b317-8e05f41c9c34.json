There was precious little else to do while sitting in the long line of cars queueing to get into the July course on the second day of Newmarket's big midsummer meeting. Yet 24 hours earlier, when the card included a Group One race, it had been possible to drive straight up to the main entrance at precisely the same time. The difference, of course, is that Thursday was \"Ladies' Day\", which is one of the most brilliant wheezes in marketing history. You take a days' racing, rechristen it Ladies' Day and suddenly an extra 5,000 people turn up. Every track in the country seems to be trying to get in on the act these days, and who can blame them? There were more than 14,000 racegoers at Newmarket on Thursday, yet 24 hours later, when the July Cup, the midsummer sprint championship, was the centrepiece of the card along with the Bunbury Cup, the figure dropped back below 9,000. Ladies' Day at Ascot, though \u2013 the original and best \u2013 is no longer the biggest day of the Royal meeting in terms of attendance, having been pushed into second place by the Saturday card, which has been officially \"Royal\" for less than a decade, and growing sharply in popularity from one year to the next. It was no great surprise, then, when Newmarket confirmed a desire \u2013 first reported in this paper's Seen And Heard column \u2013 to shift the July meeting one day forward from next year, and race from Thursday to Saturday. Nor any shock when the tracks that currently race on that Saturday \u2013 Ascot, Chester and York \u2013 responded, in the politest possible way, that Newmarket might want to keep its grubby mitts to itself. Many of the biggest Flat meetings, not to mention Cheltenham over the jumps, have been edging towards the weekend for years. Saturday is paydirt day for a major track, when you can squeeze in the punters until the pips squeak, but there are only 30 or so of them in the seven-month period that is the meat of the Flat season. Competition for Saturday dates will always be fierce, yet what is interesting about Newmarket last week is that even at the headquarters of Flat racing, the quality of the card is clearly not an over-riding concern when racegoers decide whether, and when, to attend. And what they will cheerfully turn up for is an \"event\", one that includes horse-racing as a significant element but not necessarily the primary one. Price is no great deterrent either once that decision has been made. You can argue all you like about the cost of going racing in Britain \u2013 and it is a question that journalists, with their metal badges, should always treat with care \u2013 but when Newmarket can get 14,000 people paying between \u00a322 and \u00a335, it is hard to think they have pitched prices too high. Even in the current climate, there is money to be made from racing if you get the quality and the marketing right. But while Ascot, Chester, York and Newmarket begin to square up over the second Saturday in July, what is truly baffling is that on the second day of last weekend, there was no Flat racing in Britain at all. Sunday, surely, is the most under-exploited day of the week, with the potential for crowds to rival those on Saturdays. A July meeting from Friday \u2013 which would be Ladies' Day \u2013 to Sunday would maintain York's status as the top meeting on Saturday, and give Newmarket what is currently a blank day to exploit and develop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
