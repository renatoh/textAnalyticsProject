We have a park, as promised, which as the boosters say is the size of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens combined. The early signs are that it will be a place people actually use and not, as it might have been, a zone for shopping trolley safaris. There seem to be sane plans for its continued upkeep. Its edges are marked by buildings of various degrees of impressiveness. The Aquatics Centre is now a magnificent place for swimming, for which it might be forgiven its cost in gold and steel, and the fact that, when you try to enter what you think is its grand entrance under a large cantilevered portico, it turns out it's not. You have to find your way in round the side. There's the unimpeachable Velodrome, the perfectly OK Copper Box, and the unfussy stadium, all of which now seem to have viable futures. It remains a scandal that the stadium deal involved, in effect, a vast public gift, plus a loan from one of the poorest boroughs in the country, to a Premier League football team, West Ham, owned by two former porn barons. Even so, the current state of Olympic legacy is way ahead of Beijing or Athens or any Olympic city in recent times. The answer to the question \"What did the Olympics do for us?\", apart from the remembered glow of national sporting achievement, is this. More is promised \u2013 branches of the Victoria and Albert Museum and University College London, and housing. At the fringes, in Hackney Wick, there is the prospect of enhancing the area without obliterating its existing qualities, which is a trick rarely pulled off. Now the southern part of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, as the place is now called, has been completed, the northern part having opened last summer. Where the north was conceived as a dog-walking, strolling sort of place, the south is to be more intensively used, with a children's playground and spaces for events both paid-for and free. It also contains the ArcelorMittal Orbit, the 114.5m high red steel sculpture by artist Anish Kapoor, engineer Cecil Balmond and architect the late Kathryn Findlay. The park is designed by the American-based, British-born James Corner and his practice, Field Operations, which, as the boosters also love to point out, designed the High Line in New York, the name of which has become a shorthand for everything marvellous in park design of this millennium. (To be more precise, he co-designed the High Line with architects Diller, Scofidio + Renfro and plantsman and garden designer Piet Oudolf, but as Corner's role has sometimes been understated, it's fair if it's exaggerated now.) But \u2013 and you will have spotted that this article has been telegraphing a \"but\" from the start \u2013 this is no High Line. Of course it's not, given that the latter is made out of an elevated ex-railway in Manhattan, but the south park also lacks some of the other's intelligence. Part of the genius of the High Line is its simplicity \u2013 a very small range of elements is used to make the paving and seats, the better to bring out the latent wonders of the place. In the Queen Elizabeth Park we get a Disneyfied version. There is a frenzy of wacky light fittings, of playground installations, of seats, tree species, sculptural lumps of granite, kiosks, railings and coloured surfaces. It's not helped by the fact that Corner's area of influence is quite small, and fringed by the work of others. To one side is some (very nice) planting by the same Piet Oudolf who collaborated on the High Line, and a bridge by Heneghan Peng, which adds mirrored steel panels and gabion embankments to the over-loaded palette. The park's suppliers of electricity have added their own contribution, with some prominent distribution equipment. As with the High Line, the park has latent wonders \u2013 its changes of level and waterways, which have been cleaned up and restored, and rather prominent sports buildings \u2013 which are in danger of being drowned out by the jangling of multiple motifs. At times it feels like an exhibition of hard standing and balustrades, with a park struggling to get out. It suffers from an Olympic syndrome, where everyone wants to be a Mo or a Jessica and make their mark. No one, except perhaps the admirable Oudolf, wants to do the quiet stuff. Certainly not the student housing developers Unite, who have built an astoundingly ugly block of 1,001 units between the Athletes' Village and Westfield shopping centre that looms aggressively in almost every vista. Great care was taken to make the Athletes' Village aesthetically orderly, to the point where it began to resemble Ceausescu's Bucharest: this eruption makes such efforts futile. Certainly not the Orbit, either, which as legend has it was conceived in a conversation between Boris Johnson and Laksmi Mittal in the gents at Davos. It continues to look like the result of a competition to see who could piss the most steel into the air. It occasionally offers glimpses of the effects that made Kapoor's 2009 Royal Academy show vastly popular, but these are obscured by the clunkiness of the structure. At ground level it offers a harsh fence and lumpy support buildings which do nothing to help the park feel like a park. All of which means that the best places are in the more serene north park. There is something noble about this big space, with the sporting monuments around it. It is crossed with roads and railways as well as canals, but these somehow add to the experience. All the better if, when approaching it from Stratford on the eastern side, you don't have to pass through the visual equivalent of several mobile ringtones going off at once."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
