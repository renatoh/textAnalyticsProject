Before claims of forgery and false representation surfaced, Kallakis's empire included ownership of many London buildings including a property in Victoria housing the Telegraph newspaper titles and a Metropolitan Police department. The Home Office's Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Croydon and the Department of Health's offices in Vauxhall were also in Kallakis's portfolio. Alleged victims of the loan fraud, according to the Serious Fraud Office which is bringing the prosecution, were Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Scotland, the latter now an arm of partially state-owned Lloyds Banking Group. Once alerted to the alleged fraud, AIB took control and sold the relevant properties, booking a \u00a356m loss. Losses of \u00a35m incurred by Bank of Scotland related to a shipping loan advanced to Kallakis's businesses. Kallakis has denied wrongdoing and the case has been sent to Southwark crown court. In March last year the Guardian identified Kallakis as the unnamed property investor at the heart of an SFO investigation into multimillion-pound loan fraud allegations, revealing that he had previously gone by the name Stephanos Kollakis \u2014 with an \"o\" rather than an \"a\". He had been involved in several small-scale failed businesses which appear to have few assets. Among the ventures to sink into administration were the SS Manxman, a disco boat moored at West Waterloo Dock in Liverpool, and Electras, a nightclub in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. Despite this track record, he was able to reinvent himself as a leading player in London real estate for much of the past decade, striking deals with Telegraph owners the Barclay brothers, real-estate specialists, the Tchenguiz brothers, and property entrepreneurs, the Reuben brothers. A paid-for listing on the Who's Who in America website describes him as a patron of the English National Ballet, member of the development board for the National Portrait Gallery and recipient of the Churchill Award for Excellence from the \"Churchill Enterprise Foundation\". He also holds the title of \"His Excellency, ambassador of the Republic of San Marino to the Sultanate of Brunei\". The focus for SFO investigators has been apparent lease payment guarantees provided by blue-chip companies. These guarantees allegedly gave comfort to lending banks that they were extending loans for the purchase of properties that came with longer, more lucrative leases than was in truth the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
