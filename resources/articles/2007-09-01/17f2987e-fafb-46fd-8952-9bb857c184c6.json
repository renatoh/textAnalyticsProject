Three weeks earlier the second-round tie between the sides had been abandoned amid fears that the Leicester defender Clive Clarke would lose his life after collapsing in the dressing room at half-time. Forest were leading 1-0 at the time and when the game was played again, the Foxes insisted that they present the home side with the goal with which they had led.From the kick-off Leicester stood to one side to allow the goalkeeper Paul Smith to stroll through and hand Forest back their advantage. The Football League's head of communications, John Nagle, said: \"Football League chairman, Lord Mawhinney, contacted Leicester City chief executive, Tim Davies, this morning to congratulate the club on their act of sportsmanship against Nottingham Forest. Leicester's actions are a demonstration of football at its very best and they reflect extremely well on the game.\" After Nathan Tyson had put Forest back in front following Alan Sheehan's equaliser for Leicester, late goals from Richard Stearman and the captain Stephen Clemence saw the Foxes progress to the third round and set up another Midlands derby against Aston Villa. The Villa defender Gary Cahill will not be available for that tie after joining Sheffield United on a three-month loan deal. The 21-year-old England Under-21 international has been restricted to two appearances by Martin O'Neill so far this season and will move to Bramall Lane in an attempt to play first-team football. However, Sheffield-born Cahill insists he is looking to make the switch temporary. \"I'm perfectly happy at Villa, I just need games,\" he said. \"My career's going fine but I felt what was important was keeping it going by playing games. The most important thing for me was playing for a big club that's doing well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
