So many goals are going in because he's struggling in the centre-half positions. So Liverpool targeted the area where Newcastle are weak: they gave the two centre-halves a problem by opting to play two wide men, and playing them really wide. If the ball was in a central position, the two wide men stayed right out on the touchline and gave the full-backs a problem. So the full-backs were caught in half positions, covering centre-halves and watching out for the wide men. That gave a lot of space between the centre-halves and the full-backs, meaning it was two-on-two with Neil Mellor and Milan Baros up against Robbie Elliott and Titus Bramble. Liverpool tried to feed Baros the ball in front of him, or he could turn back when in the centre. If the ball was wide in behind the full-back, then Baros would run into the channels, taking centre-halves with him. If the full-backs did come in and tighten, then the wide men would get the ball. Alternatively, you can have the wingers come deeper and bring the full-back with them. The ball played over the top of the full-back has Baros running into the space the full-back has left. Fortunately for Newcastle, those wide men - Harry Kewell and Luis Garc\u00eda - were not at their best. They did their job tactically all right but the technical side - beating people and crossing it - wasn't great. To give your wide men licence to roam you've got to have two central midfielders who can do it in there on their own. Liverpool did: Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard. Gerrard's playing like two men now, with his extra power and heading ability in the middle of the park. Newcastle couldn't cope. But it was Lee Bowyer who swung it. After his booking he could stay on his feet and help his team or take a swipe at somebody and get sent off. His choice was to whack somebody and walk off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
