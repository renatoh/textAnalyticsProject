You're not allowed to interrupt or divert him from the course of each answer. He enjoys it. Yesterday, for example, he was at the liaison committee, which consists of 32 committee chairmen, plus the chairman of the committee chairmen, if you get my drift. At two and a half hours, it's a long slog. Indeed, nearly half of the chairpersons hadn't even come, possibly deciding that they would rather watch their grandchildren grow up. But the prime minister was unfazed. He looked almost disappointed when it ended. He might be there now, if they'd let him. They say that the internet now contains more information than all the libraries of the world. Gordon Brown is not far behind. Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, parliamentary reform, public spending and the state of the economy: it is all in there. He had a vast sheaf of notes, distinguished by slips of sticky paper in lurid colours and covered in his famous writing, as if a large and drunken centipede had crawled out of an inkpot. He rarely consulted them. The committee seemed impressed. As Goldsmith put it: \"And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, that one small head could carry all he knew.\" Except that the prime minister's head is rather large, like a giant human memory stick. They tried to ginger things up. John McFall, who chairs the Treasury committee, said that the boss of RBS was getting a \u00a39.6m pay packet \u2013 much the same as Cristiano Ronaldo gets from Real Madrid. \"Isn't it true that the bankers have won, and like Ronaldo are running rings round the government and the regulators?\" This stab at more colourful English received a long rambling answer, including the line \"any excessive payments are unacceptable\". This word \"unacceptable\" is a favourite in the Brown lexicon. He later used it about BNP policy. It means, roughly: \"I don't like it, it's bad, but there is sod-all I can do about it.\" He was asked if there was a doomsday plan for up to 20% public spending cuts. \"Ridiculous!\" he said, before going on to admit that \"the profile of public spending will be different\". In the same way, I suppose, the profile of Anne Boleyn was different after her head came off. There is a circular quality to many of his arguments. He agreed that prime minister's questions should be less abusive and more constructive. \"But you said that the Tories have no policies,\" said Sir George Young. \"Is that a serious contribution to political debate?\" \"Unfortunately, that is the truth,\" Mr Brown replied. As always, what you say is vulgar knockabout. What I say comes from the purest stream of incontrovertible fact. Which was odd, because when they asked him what he planned to read on holiday, he replied \"fiction\". No doubt on one of those Kindles, so that can be downloaded too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
