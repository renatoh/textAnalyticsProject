Jamie Roberts against Jean de Villiers, the find of the Lions against the 28-year-old from Western Province. In the quest to carry the ball as quickly as possible over the gain line, the inner midfield is where the attacking side often make the first real thrust. There is nothing pretty about it and certainly nothing subtle, but if the 12 makes headway, with compass set for maximum directness, it makes life a lot easier for the other 14. That is in attack. In defence, the 12 is always in the line of heavy traffic, either his opposite number or some even larger back-row forward. It all takes its toll. Roberts fractured his skull against Australia last autumn in a clash of heads with his opposite number, Stirling Mortlock. As recently as last Wednesday he went down holding his shoulder. As for De Villiers, he has been around a bit longer, since 2002, and in most positions down the three-quarter line in his 46-cap career. But he has also missed a fair bit through injury. Way back in 2003, when South Africa did not win the World Cup, he missed the tournament in Australia with a knee injury sustained in the slightly less glittering surroundings of Brakpan, against the Falcons. In 2007, when the Springboks were crowned world champions in France, he missed all bar 40 minutes of the campaign, ripping a muscle in his biceps in South Africa's opening game, against Samoa. \"I remember getting my medal,\" he says at a loose gathering of the Springbok squad at Fourways in Johannesburg, \"and not feeling part of it. For me, the Lions are the World Cup I never had. You know, a lot of players plan their careers around the cycles of the World Cup. But the Lions only come here once every 12 years now. So, some guys alter their plans, their entire careers for the Lions. That's me.\" At the time of the last Lions tour of his homeland, De Villiers was still at school. \"I watched the Newlands [Cape Town] Test from the stands. Matt Dawson's dummy haunts us to this day. You know, that tour told me how big the Lions thing was. And what a mistake we made in South Africa, not thinking they would be a very strong team. That was a mistake, I promise you, we will not be making again.\" This would have sounded slightly more chilling if De Villiers had been upright and towering at his full height. But he is perched cautiously on the edge of his chair, having hobbled across the room and lowered himself with difficulty. \"Sorry,\" he says. \"I woke up with a stiff back. It gets me every now and again, like just before the Test in Wales last autumn. My career, eh? The injuries seem to keep coming. With this back, I just have funny pains in funny places.\" He missed the Super 14 season after 18 April, having partially torn a groin muscle against the Hurricanes in Wellington. \"That was a massive scare. I thought I would limp out of the Lions series.\" It would be easy to paint a picture of De Villiers as a liability, but the back would ease, the groin was now fine, and he would be ready to take his part. If selected. The word is that if he is fit, he will play. Wynand Olivier was man of the match in the Super 14 final, a blond blur of aggression and power at 12 for the Bulls, but De Villiers is reckoned to be even more forthright, committed. And even blonder. He does recognise, however, that he has had a tough time of late. \"Sure, this has been an emotional rollercoaster for me. You have your highs and lows and you have to be patient when you have your injuries. It has taken me time to heal. You teach yourself how to deal with it each time, even if you have doubts about whether you will be able to stand up and reach high levels again. I'm fortunate that I've made it back.\" And what of his confrontation with Roberts, starting with next Saturday's first Test? \"I didn't see him in that first game against the Royal XV. Well, I saw 20 minutes of him. I was at Jaque Fourie's wedding. I know Roberts has not played much as a 12, but he's obviously done a fantastic job. Playing him with Brian O'Driscoll, who is still hell of a player, will be interesting.\" He does not say \"interesting\" in a way that made you think he was genuinely interested. Or at least not in the potential of the Lions midfield; only in its destruction. De Villiers runs hard and straight and at speed. And tackles with a similar disregard for his safety. He has been, however, affected by more sensitive matters, like form and confidence this season. His Super 14 franchise, the Stormers, had an indifferent season and De Villiers, their captain, came under pressure from the most critical rugby public in South Africa. And that is saying something in this country never shy about starting a rugby row. He had started the season well, but as the poor run grew longer, he began to knock the ball forward, falter on his charges. Even his defensive advances into the faces of his opponents lost their vigour. He recovered, as did his team. But then came the groin injury, to leave him in a strange place. \"I guess you could call it my jealousy compartment. I look at what the Bulls did in the Super 14, and especially their final, and I feel frustrated it was them, not us. But the Springboks are a close family. We will take strength from the Bulls and use their momentum to flow over into the Springboks.\" Call it momentum, call it midfield mayhem, but where the 12s meet will be the melting pot of the series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
