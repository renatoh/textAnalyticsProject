A slack-faced, dead-eyed little girl, growling through a grotesque lipless rictus, charges The Walking Dead's hero, sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes. He waits until she gets close to unsentimentally shoot her through the head. This first moment (a flash-forward, it transpires) amounts to an artistic statement of intent from Darabont to the zombie-aficionado hordes out there: \"Stick with me, superfans, I'm serious about this.\" Darabont is well known as Steven King's best advocate in Hollywood, a director who has shepherded several King stories to the screen \u2013 Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, The Mist \u2013 with care and respect to the source material. And the opening episode of The Walking Dead, it turns out, has a lot in common with the first 200 pages of King's not entirely successful, but highly influential 1979 epic The Stand (which Romero was once slated to direct), in which 96% of humankind is wiped out by a virus, leaving small groups of immune survivors wandering alone and terrified in a corpse-filled landscape. Those dead didn't walk, but Darabont's do. He is of the opinion that zombies should kick it Romero style: groaning, shuffling, but utterly implacable and VERY hungry for their corporeal fast-food. The Walking Dead's narrative proper kicks off as we flash back to before the epidemic. Grimes is shot in a gun battle with meth dealers, then wakes up from a coma in hospital a week or so later. There is no electricity, the place is deserted and silent, his wound is slowly healing, and there's a room at the end of the corridor bearing the spray-painted legend \"DEAD INSIDE! DON'T ENTER\" The entrance is chained shut, but some inexplicable groaning tumult within is pressing the doors outwards. He obeys the sign. His house is empty, although signs of hurried packing \u2013 mementos and photo albums are gone \u2013 suggest his wife and child may have survived, but for now he is alone. Alone that is except for a young girl-zombie, legless and trailing her intestines behind her, whom Grimes later dispatches out of simple compassion. In time he joins up with Morgan Jones and his young son, Duane (reference-alert: Duane Jones was the star of Night of The Living Dead), holing up in their house, to which Morgan's now zombified wife keeps returning, as if on instinct. Morgan tries, but he cannot bring himself to blow out the brains of his son's mother. Wrenching stuff. Darabont has said he cast actors free from baggage to allow a clean slate for his characters, and particularly resourceful everyman Grimes. That will work for American audiences, but not British ones, given that Grimes is played \u2013 with a lush Georgia accent \u2013 by Andrew Lincoln of This Life, while actor-playwright Lennie James plays Morgan. In interviews Lincoln has said he drew on the silent solidity of Gary Cooper and he certainly holds the screen very capably, bearing the weight of the whole show on his shoulders. Those worried about the gore factor \u2013 AMC has only recently permitted the writers of Mad Men to use words like \"shit\", \"bullshit\" and the (bleeped) \"fuck\" \u2013 need not have fretted. Darabont has been permitted to let fly with the brains and the gore \u2013 having Terminator producer Gale Anne Hurd on board probably helped. We've yet to see anyone's innards being flung to the four corners of the screen, but I fancy soon enough we shall. There seems to be budget too: in the opening episode's closing scenes, Grimes makes the mistake of heading into downtown Atlanta \u2013 where he is confronted and surrounded by the massed armies of the dead.The horde of extras is surely a sign of AMC's confidence in Darabont's vision. The Walking Dead looks promising in its opening episode, and for my money there couldn't have been a wiser choice to shepherd it to the small screen than Frank Darabont, who will have to face his audience at the next San Diego Comic-Con. Judging by what he's achieved here, in terms of keeping faith with genre and audience alike, and in terms of sheer excitement and inventiveness, one suspects the zombie hordes of San Diego will greet him with a standing ovation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
