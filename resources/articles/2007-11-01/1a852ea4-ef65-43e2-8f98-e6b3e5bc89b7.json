A statement from Knight Vinke called for the release of documents showing which investors were consulted about changes to the share plan that could pay top directors \u00a35m next May. The demand followed claims by HSBC that the share scheme was backed by investors representing more than 50% of the share capital and the Association of British Insurers. The bank also defended the scheme which it said was modest compared with rival banks. The dispute centres on a bonus scheme for top directors including chairman Stephen Green, chief executive Michael Geoghegan and finance director Douglas Flint. They are due to share a payout of about \u00a35m if they push earnings per share up 52% from a starting point in 2005. However, Eric Knight, the chief executive of Knight Vinke Asset Management, argued shareholders were misled about the workings of the scheme and that investors he represented were not consulted. He said the share option scheme was flawed and argued it was rare for large companies to adopt the complex calculation used by HSBC to support their share option schemes. A legal opinion by Lord Grabiner that shareholders received \"insufficient\" information to vote on the HSBC share plan was published on Thursday. Knight's firm has battled for the last couple of months to provoke a shake-up at the bank. It placed large adverts in national newspapers this week to publicise his concerns about its strategy. He said in a statement from New York yesterday: \"Having recently met many of HSBC's largest shareholders, specifically to discuss the share plan and other matters, it is absolutely clear to us that many of HSBC's largest shareholders were not made aware of the full details which permits substantial performance-related payments for no performance at all. \"Once again, this raises important issues about governance at HSBC. We call on HSBC to publish the documents used in the discussions with institutional shareholders, the minutes of any remuneration committee meetings since 2004 that pertain to the Plan and the advice given to the Board by Towers Perrin, consultants to the remuneration committee, relating to the Plan. Knight said he wanted the scheme declared void and re-submitted to shareholders at the next AGM. A spokesman for HSBC said: \"We do not accept the allegation that the notice to the 2005 AGM was insufficient, nor do we accept that our shareholders were misled. The share plan resolution was validly approved. \"There is an established consultation procedure in the UK for schemes like this. HSBC followed these procedures, and there was an extensive consultation process with our largest shareholders and the Association of British Insurers. \"The ABI, commenting on the proposal to approve the Share Plan at the2005 AGM, confirmed it received general support from the shareholders consulted.\" The ABI was unavailable for comment yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
