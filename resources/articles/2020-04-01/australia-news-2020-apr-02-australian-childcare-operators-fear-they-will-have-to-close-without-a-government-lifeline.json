The next national cabinet meeting on Friday is due to discuss the early childhood sector, but operators say the need is immediate and they have already had to retrench educators or reduce hours because of the steep decline in children\u2019s attendance amid the coronavirus crisis. Many in the sector have called for a change to the existing rules around fee charging. Currently, parents have to continue paying the \u201cgap\u201d between the childcare subsidy and the centre\u2019s fee, even during absences. This situation is leading some families to cancel their enrolments altogether, meaning centres no longer receive the childcare subsidy that accounts for a large part of their revenue. That is putting the future viability of childcare centres at risk. Monique Atack, the director of Hunny Pots Early Learning Centre in Glenwood, New South Wales, said the centre usually had 56 children, but over the past two weeks an average of just 15 were attending each day. More than 10% of parents had cancelled their children\u2019s enrolment altogether, with that share growing by the day. \u201cWe made our first redundancy yesterday, which was heartbreaking. Being a family-owned business, our staff is our family,\u201d Atack said, adding that staff members had also had their hours reduced. \u201cThey [the government] have got to act and it\u2019s got to be immediate. If they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to really suffer.\u201d Early Childhood Australia, a peak body, estimates that across most of the nation, about 650 early childhood education and care services \u2013 or 4% \u2013 have already closed. While those figures largely comprise outside school hours care, it also includes some long day-care centres. The data collected so far do not include Tasmania and the Northern Territory. The peak body\u2019s chief executive, Samantha Page, called on the government to continue to pay services the childcare subsidy based on enrolment numbers in the first week of March, before the steep drop in attendance. The childcare subsidy accounted for about 60% of the revenue of childcare centres, Page said. She said the government should also waive the contribution required to be charged to parents when the children were absent. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that everybody could continue to be employed at the same hours, but it would certainly secure a good proportion of jobs,\u201d Page said. She said this proposal would be a better support than the recently announced jobkeeper payment, because services may not reach the drop in turnover threshold. She did not want to see centres put in a position of potentially having to close \u2013 with their turnover therefore vanishing \u2013 in order to be eligible for the new wages subsidy of $1,500 per fortnight per worker. The country\u2019s biggest childcare operator, Goodstart Early Learning, said its 665 centres remained open but were experiencing increasing numbers of absences. Goodstart told its 3,000 casual educators last week that it was no longer able to provide them with ongoing work. The chief executive of Goodstart, Julia Davison, said many of these educators were \u201cextremely distressed\u201d and looking for assurances that the organisation would be able to provide assistance through the government\u2019s recently announced jobkeeper payment program. The group is seeking clarity from the government about its eligibility. \u201cGoodstart Early Learning urgently requires access to the jobkeeper scheme and a viability package to keep our centres open and retain our dedicated highly trained educators and teachers through the next six months in order to continue the essential support we provide for vulnerable children and essential services workers,\u201d Davison said. Helen Gibbons, the United Workers Union\u2019s director of early childhood education, said parents were un-enrolling their children from childcare to avoid having to pay the gap fee, which in turn was costing educators either their jobs or their normal rostered hours. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the first wave is all of the casuals losing their hours and a fairly significant part of the sector is staffed by casuals,\u201d Gibbons said. These developments were \u201ctragic\u201d. But changes to stop charging the gap fee could help \u201ckeep the centres alive\u201d. Gibbons said educators had also been organising for centres to implement additional safety measures to avoid Covid-19 spreading, including temperature checks before children entered each day, as social distancing was impractical in these contexts. \u201cYou can\u2019t change a nappy from 1.5 metres away,\u201d she said. Last month the government made some changes, including increasing to 62 the number of days that a childcare service would continue to receive the childcare subsidy when a child was absent from care. It has also pointed to a grants scheme for special circumstances. However, Labor\u2019s early childhood education spokesperson, Amanda Rishworth, said the government needed to announce a more comprehensive solution right away. \u201cThere\u2019s already a direct relationship between the centres and the government. The government is already paying them a subsidy. Make it as simple as possible: pay the subsidy and keep them open.\u201d Federal, state and territory education ministers are considering regulatory, funding and viability measures. An announcement is expected after the national cabinet of leaders meets on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
