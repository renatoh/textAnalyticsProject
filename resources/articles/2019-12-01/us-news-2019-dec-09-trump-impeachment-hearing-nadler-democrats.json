It did not go smoothly. Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chair of the House judiciary committee, had barely begun introducing the session when a bearded young man got up from the public seats at the back of the chamber and started yelling. \u201cAmericans are sick of your impeachment scam! Trump is innocent!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re the one committing treason. America is done with this!\u201d As uniformed Capitol policeman began ushering him from the chamber, he declared: \u201cYou can kick me out, but he\u2019s the one committing crimes.\u201d There is a long history of protesters at congressional hearings, but this was no ordinary member of the public. He was Owen Shroyer, who works as a host at the far-right conspiracy site Infowars. Shroyer was active in spreading the most bizarre conspiracy theory of the 2016 presidential election, that Hillary Clinton was running a pedophile ring through a string of pizza restaurants. The spreading of the fabricated allegations led to staff at the targeted restaurants being subjected to threats and harassment, and an armed man turning up at a Washington pizzeria with an AR-15 assault rifle in December 2016, threatening staff and shooting off the lock of a cupboard, supposedly in pursuit of an a personal \u201cinvestigation\u201d into the pedophile claims. The gunman was sentenced to four years in jail. Shroyer is clearly still in business. His Twitter account recorded his arrest, pushing the hashtag #FreeOwenShroyer. Shroyer\u2019s disruption was not just an incidental disturbance, but an opening salvo in the real battle underlying the impeachment hearings: a battle over the power to shape reality. Shroyer is on the leading edge of an effort to create a parallel universe, conjured up from a constantly replenished cloud of fabrications. The pizzeria gunman incident demonstrated the real-world consequences of an invented reality. The aim now is to insulate Donald Trump from damaging facts \u2013 so that he could ultimately, as he has boasted, shoot someone on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue and get away with it. The Republican strategy in Congress is to fight on two fronts, arguing the facts of impeachment while at the same time pursuing a disinformation campaign promoting a conspiracy theory that secret Clinton emails had been hidden on an internet server located somewhere in Ukraine. The theory betrays a lack of a basic understanding of how the internet works, and has been rejected as baseless by the US intelligence community and the president\u2019s own former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert. The Republicans also pursued a hybrid approach inside the hearing room: seeking to disrupt the hearings, and when that failed, resorting to legal argument. Behind the Republican bench, party operatives set up placards that sought to make an issue of the absence of the lead Democratic investigator, Adam Schiff. One striking 4ft high poster showed Schiff in a \u201cMissing\u201d notice on the side of a carton of milk, in the space used normally for the photos of lost children. As chair of another panel, the House intelligence committee, Schiff was not supposed to be there, but the posters helped foment a sense of conspiracy around the hearings. As Monday\u2019s hearing continued, the Republican members repeatedly tried to drown out Nadler\u2019s remarks and loosen his grip on proceedings, shouting out points of order, and then demanding a rollcall vote on them. The repeated votes, requiring each committee member to voice an aye or nay, ensured that they all remained in the chamber throughout the hearing. One of the points of order, raised by Mike Johnson of Louisiana, complained that the argument of the majority counsel, the lawyer making the case against Trump, \u201cimpugns the motives of the president\u201d, and therefore represented a violation of parliamentary rules \u2013 ignoring the fact that that is precisely what impeachment is all about. The Republicans brought out their point orders and parliamentary challenges in casading volleys and Nadler \u2013 a 72-year-old congressional veteran \u2013 struggled at times to fend them off, hammering away with his gavel, his authority teetering at times before he ultimately steadied himself. The substance of the hearing brought little, if any, new information to light. They represented a summary of the arguments made during the earlier hearings held by the House intelligence committee, that Trump used the power of his office to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate his political opponents. While the Democrats emphasised the import of the moment, with the fate of the republic at stake, the Republicans sought when possible, to make light of the proceedings as a distraction from the looming election campaign. The minority counsel, Stephen Castor, arrived in the chamber with his papers in a large green supermarket bag, emblazoned with the words: \u201cLive, eat, shop, reuse.\u201d He put it on the witness table as press cameras swarmed around it. On a hearing suffused with recycled talking points, it had as good a chance as anything of becoming the defining image of the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
