Northern Rock slumped to a new low of 185.2p, down 71.8p. There was a combination of reasons, starting with the growing feeling that a bid for the bank may be wishful thinking. Even if Lloyds TSB, or whoever, comes in with a bid, it will inevitably be a low one. Added to that came the Treasury's statement that the guarantee for the mortgage bank's depositors announced on Monday did not apply to new accounts. This raised the prospect the company may have to wind down its business. A note from Citigroup did not help, saying Northern Rock shares could be worth as little as 6p each. It looked at three possible scenarios. If the business is run down in an orderly fashion it could be worth 130p a share. A bidder could push this up to around 220p, but it could fall to 6p if Northern Rock has to rely on extended Bank of England support as it staggers to its demise. \"We reduce our price target from 400p to 150p to reflect what we see as the maximum realistic bid acceptable to both seller and buyer,\" said Citi. In such a febrile market, rumours about other banks applying for Bank of England help were bound to resurface, and so it proved. HBOS fell 37p to 837p, prompting it to say that rumours of funding problems were \"complete and utter nonsense\". Alliance &amp; Leicester lost 60p to 755.5p while Bradford &amp; Bingley fell 28.2p to 299.75p. So the mood was downbeat, and by the close the FTSE 100 index was 31 points lower at 6429.0. There was little support from Wall Street. US figures showed the number of people signing on for benefit last week fell by 9,000 compared with expectations of a rise. But this was overshadowed by poor results from Bear Stearns - one of the banks deeply involved in the sub-prime crisis - and a warning from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, that there were more mortgage defaults to come. Back to the takeover talk. Friends Provident jumped 7.1p to 174.7p on suggestions that Zurich Financial was plotting a 210p-a-share offer. Friends, of course, is attempting to merge with Resolution, up 0.5p to 684p. But Pearl Assurance has built up a stake in Resolution in an apparent attempt to break up the merger, and Standard Life said yesterday it may be interested in bidding for Resolution. Later Resolution said it had held due diligence meetings with Pearl and Standard Life, but had held no talks on proposals and had received no firm offers from them. Mitchells &amp; Butlers moved 7.5p up to 627.5p on vague suggestions that billionaire Joe Lewis was building a stake. J Sainsbury added 15.5p to 569.5p as it opened its books to potential 600p-a-share bidder Delta Two, the Qatar-backed investment fund. Delta Two, which owns 25% of Sainsbury, raised the equity portion of the offer by \u00a3850m. Qatar's Investment Authority caused some excitement by buying a 20% stake in the London Stock Exchange, up 234p to \u00a316.87. At the same time Borse Dubai bought the 28% stake in the LSE owned by Nasdaq, and also took a shareholding in the US exchange. Cruise company Carnival sailed 157p higher to \u00a323.74 after it announced a better-than-expected 12% rise in third-quarter profits. But nightclub group Luminar lost 66.5p to 633p after a trading statement failed to impress. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher fell 11.3p to 181p as it warned of a tough second half after interim profits rose 6.2%. Panmure Gordon cut its target price from 230p to 210p. Lower down the market hedge fund Absolute Capital Management, where a row between its co-founder and the rest of the board was followed by the suspension of redemptions in some of its funds, fell another 14p to 48.5p. Phil Edmonds's Central African Mining continued on its volatile way, down another 2.25p to 28.75p on uncertainties over its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And support services group Carter &amp; Carter dropped 26p to 79p. The company said it knew of no reason for the fall but admitted it had been in discussions with its advisers and banks about the renegotiation of its banking facilities \"in conjunction with an equity issue\". Although traders had speculated the company could be planning a share issue, this is the first official confirmation and provided impetus for the share-price decline. Biotech group BTG was 10.2p better at 105.75p after Bayer and Genzyme won US approval for the leukaemia drug Campath, which they licence from BTG. Finally oil and gas group Sandhaven - quoted on Plus Markets - was steady at 143p. Today the company is expected to finalise its cash-and-share acquisition of several oil and gas leases in Texas. These could yield 32bn cubic feet of gas worth some $72m (\u00a336m). The company expects to earn revenues from the sites by the end of October. Price hint Keep an eye on printing group St Ives, down 0.75p to 220p yesterday. Last month it gave a mixed trading statement, saying market conditions remained challenging but it expected the underlying full-year performance to be ahead of 2006. Now, however, it is believed to be in line for a multi-million pound print management contract from the Royal Mail. According to a report in trade magazine PrintWeek, Royal Mail has begun due diligence at St Ives in preparation for awarding it the contract, which has been out to tender since December. The four-year deal was reported then to be worth some \u00a3400m but it is now believed the total value could have fallen by several tens of millions of pounds. Nevertheless, confirmation of the contract would give a welcome boost to the company's shares. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
