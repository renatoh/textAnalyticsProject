Speaking from the marginal Labour-held seat Grimsby, Johnson apologised to the family of Jack Williment-Barr, a four-year-old obliged to sleep under coats on a hospital floor in Leeds as he waited for a bed, despite having suspected pneumonia. He talked up planned new investments in the NHS, and sought to distance himself from nearly 10 years of Conservative rule, during some of which he served as foreign secretary. \u201cThis is a new government with a new approach, since I\u2019ve come in,\u201d he told LBC. \u201cWe\u2019re putting the biggest ever amount into the NHS, \u00a334bn, and we\u2019re hiring 50,000 more nurses.\u201d The 50,000 nurses figure includes the retention of 19,000 who are already employed. Asked what he would say to the boy\u2019s family, Johnson said: \u201cOf course, I sympathise very much, and I apologise to everybody who has a bad experience. By and large I think the NHS do an amazing job.\u201d Johnson started the day just after 6am at the fish market in Grimsby, a Tory target seat held by Labour\u2019s Melanie Onn with a majority of 2,565. He toured the market and watched a live auction before holding up a cod for the cameras and dragging a crate of fish across the warehouse. The PM got a mixed welcome with a number of fish wholesalers saying they were planning to vote for him but one started booing loudly. He was later due to travel to Sunderland to make a speech. While polling is consistently putting the Conservatives far enough ahead of Labour to seemingly ensure a majority, the party is stressing the need for voters to turn out. Speaking on Sky News, Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury and one of the most regular Tory spokespeople of recent weeks, rejected the idea that the party seemed well on course to win. \u201cPeople remember what happened last time around, and it is a tight election,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why the prime minister is out over these three days visiting all parts of this country.\u201d Speaking on LBC, Johnson promised to \u201cmake our case everywhere in the country\u201d, repeatedly hammering home familiar Conservative lines such as delivering Brexit, and the idea that the alternative to a Conservative government is a Labour-SNP coalition. However, he did not specifically back up a claim by the home secretary, Priti Patel, that Labour\u2019s approach to crime and policing would result in 4,000 extra violent assaults a year, as well as 52 more murders. Asked how Patel reached such figures, Johnson replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you must forgive me, I haven\u2019t been able to \u2026\u201d before trailing off. Asked if such predictions were \u201cproject fear\u201d, he said: \u201cWell, she\u2019s making a point about crime figures and the need to have robust policing. And I back that idea all the way.\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, Johnson expressed doubts about the HS2 rail project, saying he expected it to cost \u201cnorth of \u00a3100bn, probably\u201d, which was why the government had ordered a review into it. \u201cIt\u2019s only responsible to the taxpayer to ask whether it\u2019s being sensibly spent, and whether that funding is being prioritised rightly,\u201d he said. Johnson was similarly equivocal about his views on a third runway at Heathrow airport, something he himself in 2015 vowed to oppose by lying down in front of the construction bulldozers. Asked if this would happen, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see much sign of any bulldozers yet.\u201d Pressed on the issue, Johnson added: \u201cI would have to find some way of honouring that promise. Let\u2019s wait and see when the bulldozers arrive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
