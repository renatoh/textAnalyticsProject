Fighting with team-mates is not what the game is normally about. Yet if there is art in vision, awareness and simplicity Bowyer's performance for West Ham on Saturday could hardly have been bettered aesthetically. Returning to Upton Park after a brief and injury-stricken spell there four seasons earlier, the former Charlton, Leeds and Newcastle midfielder created three goals and was only denied one for himself by the width of a post. It was an inspired performance and a powerful reminder that for all Bowyer's reported failings as a human being he remains a potentially outstanding creative force as a footballer. Since West Ham have always been Bowyer's first love this may be the 29-year-old's best and possibly last chance of redemption. Certainly in helping them beat Charlton after falling behind to an early penalty he appeared about as intimidating as a choirboy. Bowyer may not be about to record Oh For The Wings Of A Dove for posterity but on Saturday his behaviour,like his passing, was faultless. The judgment of Alan Pardew, the West Ham manager, in signing a player with a notably poor disciplinary record appeared vindicated. Pardew had told his directors: \"Look, I know him, this guy is a fantastic player. Once he comes into our environment he will be the Lee Bowyer of old.\" That does not sound much of a recommendation but presumably Pardew was talking about footballing skills. \"He was an England international today on that performance,\" Pardew added, although the notion of Steve McClaren dropping David Beckham in order to pick Bowyer seems a mite far-fetched. Bowyer's England career is likely to progress no further than the 62 minutes he was granted by Sven-Goran Eriksson in a friendly against Portugal at Villa Park four years ago. Nevertheless Bowyer was an influence from start to finish on Saturday. In the opening minute his astute lob split the Charlton defence and in stoppage time a similar ball sent Carlton Cole clear to score West Ham's third goal only 24 seconds after coming off the bench. In between times Bowyer's was the centre that Yossi Benayoun glanced on towards the far post for Bobby Zamora to bring the scores level early in the second half, and it was Bowyer again who provided the cross from which Zamora's mishit shot put West Ham ahead just past the hour. Bowyer has quickly given Pardew's team a fresh dimension on the right. The West Ham manager is still increasing the depth of his squad and although the loss of Dean Ashton, who broke an ankle training with England last week, was a severe blow the scoring instincts of Zamora and the arrival of Cole from Chelsea will still give him strong attacking options. Any optimism Charlton and their new manager, Iain Dowie,gained from Darren Bent's penalty, awarded on the quarter-hour after Danny Gabbidon had handled Bryan Hughes's dipping centre, evaporated once Djimi Traor\u00e9, having been cautioned for fouling Bowyer, then not only fouled Marlon Harewood three minutes later but tried to prevent Bowyer taking a quick free-kick. Traor\u00e9's dismissal left Charlton to defend their lead for more than an hour, a task that proved beyond them.
