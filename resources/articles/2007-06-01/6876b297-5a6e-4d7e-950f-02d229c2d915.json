It was less a cheer than the acclamation that greets the homecoming of a hero after conquests on foreign fields. He still trails Odysseus in these matters but the modern hero might have the edge when it comes to the final grid positions. The Red Arrows flew over and few looked up - those daredevil pilots must have felt like bombing their ungrateful audience. Jenson Button walked past and no one seemed to notice. When Hamilton is around he is the only show in town. Stirling was there; and Jackie; and Damon; and Emerson. But, somehow, they were noticed only when they spoke to Hamilton, when they could get a word in. Barely known only three months ago, the formula one world championship leader is fast emerging as the biggest star in British sport. That is the sort of zero-to-hero acceleration his McLaren mechanics are working on. Hamilton has had only seven formula one races and has finished third, second four times and won his past two in Canada and the United States. But even that did not prepare him for this. And the wonderful thing about him is that he seems just as astonished as everyone else. \"This is my first real taste of what the reaction has been like back home and I'm sure it's going to be double this at Silverstone in a couple of weeks,\" he said. \"It's fantastic, just amazing. It's great to see all these people supporting me. It's all new to me. I don't really know what to expect. Incredible.\" In the beautiful countryside of west Sussex this was vroom with a view. But the Festival of Speed felt more like the festival of mooching about. The heavy and steady rain made walking - let alone driving - a dangerous manoeuvre but it did not stop an estimated 60,000 coming along to pay homage to the rookie maestro. It felt like Glastonbury for petrolheads. He made his first appearance on the balcony of Goodwood House, where works by Canaletto and George Stubbs are housed, but nothing so precious as the man in the racing overalls. Not everyone had waited patiently. \"Come on, Lewis, it's chucking it down out here, it's all right for you inside,\" cried one spectator who looked in danger of being washed away. Then, after some refreshments in the Drivers' Club, he made his way to his car. His father and manager, Anthony, was also besieged by autograph hunters, a sign of a proper star. It was more a lap of honour than a racing lap by Hamilton and, if he had been driving a road car, you would have flashed him to move over. At one point he took both hands off the wheel to wave to the crowd, which would certainly have failed him his driving test. He drove two laps, one at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. And then there were the autographs. He signed pieces of paper and items of clothing, programmes and photographs. And he signed hundreds of them. \"When I was 10 I met David Coulthard and Eddie Irvine and I remember going up to some top drivers and they never really looked at me and signed an autograph. They just brushed past me. \"I remember thinking then that, if I ever got to F1, I would be sure to always look at the kid or whoever I was signing for. I feel privileged to be in this position, to see young kids and help them come through.\" The Festival of Speed is a magnificent mix of nostalgia and technical modernity. A wonderful Bugatti shimmered in the warm rain and ancient Astons vied for the multitude's attention. There was a 1932 Ford Model B Roadster, a 1946 Hewson Rocket, a 1937 Ford Station Wagon, a 1959 Plymouth, a 1959 Chevrolet Impala and many, many more. And everyone went to see Lewis in his very modern McLaren. None of this surprised Sir Jackie Stewart, three times world champion. \"Lewis Hamilton's arrival has really caught the imagination, even in America,\" he said. \"For a formula one driver to be on the front page of the LA Times as he was last week is a big deal.\" \"I have to tell you that it's not easy for a well-known racing driver to come here. There are so many people crowding into a small area. It's not an easy trip.\" Hamilton, though, managed it as if it was just another practice lap."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
