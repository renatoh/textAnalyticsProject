Part of a set of 10 unpublished letters, mostly written to his friend Richard Plunket Greene, the missives date from a difficult period in Waugh\u2019s life. The would-be author spent six months teaching at Welsh prep school Arnold House in 1925 and, while there, wrote to Plunket Greene about the lack of enjoyment he found in teaching the boys. \u201cThe older they are the more stupid I find them,\u201d he wrote. He sent the manuscript for his first novel, The Temple at Thatch, to the writer Harold Acton while he was teaching at Arnold House. Acton told him that the story was \u201ctoo English for my exotic taste. Too much nid-nodding over port,\u201d and recommended that Waugh print it \u201cin a few elegant copies for the friends who love you such as myself\u201d. In one of the letters, Waugh describes \u201cfeeling a little despondent\u201d and reveals that he had burned the manuscript, adding: \u201cIt made so much smoke that the Headmaster [went] out of Chapel to see if his school was on fire.\u201d Not all is doom and gloom \u2013 at one point Waugh tells his friend that he won the masters\u2019 egg-and-spoon race. But he also writes of how \u201cfive minutes ago I decided to accept the job at Pisa as secretary to Scott-Moncrieff \u2026 The only real regret I shall have will be leaving friends \u2026 for the most part England means only debt and drunkenness and disapproval.\u201d This job offer from Proust\u2019s translator, however, would fall through, and together with the rejection of his writing, would plunge Waugh into despair. In his autobiography A Little Learning, Waugh writes of how it drove him to leave his clothes and a note from Euripides on the beach and swim out to sea. \u201cAs earnest of my intent I had brought no towel,\u201d he writes in his memoir. \u201cI cannot tell how much real despair and act of will, how much play-acting, prompted the excursion.\u201d He was repeatedly stung by jellyfish, as it turned out, and returned to the shore. According to Sotheby\u2019s, which will auction the letters for an estimate of between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000, they provide \u201cimportant clues about Waugh\u2019s development as a writer, as well as revealing much detail about a key set of friendships, and his life in the school that was to provide the source of one of his most enduring fictions, Decline and Fall\u201d. In another letter, Waugh writes of his plans for a new novel after The Temple at Thatch was rejected. It would be, he writes, \u201ca prose epic of Silenus \u2026 with all manner of roistering in public houses and brothels\u201d. One character, he says, is \u201can unpleasing but accurate portrait of myself\u201d, but he promises that no one else is taken from real life. In another, however, he refers to the teacher who would inspire Decline and Fall\u2019s Captain Grimes: \u201cBathing has started to the intense excitement of the Sodomite master.\u201d The auction house said: \u201cIt is not a well-documented period in Waugh\u2019s life, and the recipient of these revealing and often hilarious letters was, at the time, one of the author\u2019s closest friends.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
