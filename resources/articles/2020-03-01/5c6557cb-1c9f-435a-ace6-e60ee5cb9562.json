It looked as though she\u2019d been crying. \u201cShe just said, \u2018Today\u2019s going to be our last day,\u2019 \u201d Weatherall says. The next day her housemate, a florist, brought her home a bunch of flowers. She\u2019d lost her job too. \u201cThere\u2019s also been another florist friend who lost her job, a friend of a friend who was a barber lost his job this week, so did a friend at a wine bar,\u201d she says. At a bar that weekend \u2013 the last before they were closed indefinitely due to the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 Weatherall started talking to a security guard. \u201cHe stopped me and was like, \u2018How are you doing?\u2019 I thought he was seeing if I was intoxicated but he said, \u2018No, really how are you doing?\u2019 I said, \u2018To be honest, I lost my job two days ago,\u2019 and he was like, \u2018Oh man, I lost my job today too. This is my last shift.\u2019 It was kind of a cute moment. Like, we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d It was two weeks ago that the prime minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters he would attend a football match the following day. Only a few hours later he had to backtrack. Since then, as the rate of Covid-19 infections accelerated across Australia and the world, life as we knew it has been suspended indefinitely. The entire arts industry folded in on itself and football codes went into hibernation after a ban on mass gatherings. Airlines slashed travel as border closures came into force. Pubs, cafes and restaurants shut their doors. So too did beauty parlours, auction houses, brothels, churches and casinos. With all these cascading announcements, the most significant shutdown of Australian society in living memory has brought myriad individual stories of stress, anxiety and anger. Bruce Roberts, 47, a flight attendant from Daylesford in country Victoria, was also stood down on the same day as Weatherall. His partner, Cory, is also a flight attendant. They face having no income between them. \u201cIt\u2019s placed enormous stress on us, just thinking about how are we going to pay our mortgage, the bills,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cThere\u2019s so many of us with so many questions, and right now there really is no surety.\u201d In three days at least 35,000 workers lost their jobs, 280,000 Australians lodged \u201cintent to claim\u201d benefit forms in a single morning as lines at Centrelink offices across the country snaked around blocks and the government\u2019s MyGov website crashed repeatedly. Some economists predict Australia could shed more than 1m jobs before the crisis is over, which would push the country\u2019s unemployment rate above 10%. The federal government has effectively doubled welfare payments since the outbreak but there are loud calls for further relief in the way of rent and housing assistance. Homelessness advocacy group Everybody\u2019s Home has been calling on the government to use empty hotels as emergency accomodation for those facing homelessness, along with rental assistance for people who have lost their job as a result of the crisis and a halt on evictions. \u201cRight now, we have a hospitality industry facing an extended period with thousands of unoccupied beds, while similar numbers of at-risk individuals are in desperate need of somewhere to sleep,\u201d policy manager for the group Kate Colvin said. \u201cWith modest financial support, the Morrison government could match up supply and demand and help minimise the spread of the coronavirus and the impact it\u2019s having on our communities. \u201cWe recognise there will be many calls for government support at this time, but we urge the government to place society\u2019s most vulnerable at the centre of their attention.\u201d Lyssa Tredgett was among those in Centrelink line. The 32-year-old had gone into the office of her marketing job early to make her husband, Jason, a birthday card for his 50th the next day. When she saw two of her bosses in a meeting room she wasn\u2019t initially concerned \u2013 the couple had been worried about Jason\u2019s job as a chef but believed that her position would be secure \u2013 for a while at least. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cMy boss came out and asked me for a chat and the minute he said that I knew,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was that. I went outside and cried on the road.\u201d She spent her husband\u2019s birthday applying for \u201cliterally hundreds\u201d of jobs, many of which she knows no longer exist. Then three days later Jason was let go too. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have grown up taught to be who you want to be, follow your dreams and grow a career. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it was my dream to be a marketing manager at a landscape company but it\u2019s something I chose. That complete removal of choice is so jarring, and you mourn it.\u201d The couple rent a home in Leichhardt in Sydney\u2019s inner west that costs them $1,740 a fortnight. With two young sons aged three and eight months, they already live on a tight budget. Now, with no income, they have to entirely rethink their way of life. They have been hoping for a government announcement on rent assistance but by Friday that had not happened. \u201cThe worst part about it is I feel shit but I have to get on with my day,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have savings. We don\u2019t have a safety net. But I think the real shock is two weeks down the line when the money we have now is gone. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with grief. Somebody dies and two weeks later they fall apart in the supermarket. So not only are we waiting for the worst of the health and economic implications for the country, I\u2019m sitting here with my jigsaw puzzles and playdough for my kids while I wait to have a breakdown.\u201d After days of failing to access MyGov, Weatherall set an alarm for 2.45am and finally got through. \u201cI just feel so confused all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to think about what\u2019s going to happen in the future but I think that is exactly what I feel upset about. It\u2019s too hard for us to comprehend everything that\u2019s happened but I feel like the government should be making it easier and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d In Melbourne, Marlee Jane Ward, a 37-year-old writer and receptionist, posted a screenshot of the documents she\u2019d been asked to provide Centrelink online after she successfully made her claim. It was shared hundreds of times. The winner of the 2016 Victorian premier\u2019s literary award for writing for young adults, Ward paid the bills with a day job as a receptionist that disappeared last Monday. The work she had as a writer and speaker had already completely dried up. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no framework for what the future is going to look like, especially for anyone who works in the arts or a customer-facing position,\u201d she says. \u201cMy job that paid the bills was casual so I had no leave entitlements or redundancy. It\u2019s really revealed how fucking tenuous everything was to begin with.\u201d Common among all the people Guardian Australia spoke to this week was a recognition that Covid-19 had prompted a dramatic reshaping of modern life which could not quickly be undone. \u201cI don\u2019t think the world is going to be the same after this,\u201d Ward says. \u201cMaybe, I hope, it will be a little bit fairer for people who don\u2019t have as much. If capitalism can\u2019t last two weeks without completely falling apart maybe it\u2019s time to look for something a bit fucking better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
