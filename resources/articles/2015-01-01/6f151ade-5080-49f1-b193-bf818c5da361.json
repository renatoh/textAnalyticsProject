Bill Belichick, the notoriously media-averse coach of the New England Patriots, called a surprise press conference on Saturday afternoon, then went on an unexpected offensive in the face of a football-deflation controversy that had led network TV newscasts for days. He was 35 minutes late. He spoke at length about ball textures, equilibriums, rubbing processes and atmospheric pressures. He name-checked Mona Lisa Vito, a character from the 1992 Joe Pesci comedy My Cousin Vinny. And then it got weird. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to talk about the amount of time that I\u2019ve put into this relative to the important challenge in front of us,\u201d Belichick said, in a break from preparing his team for next week\u2019s Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona. \u201cAt no time was there any intent whatsoever to try to compromise the integrity of the game or try to gain an advantage. Quite the opposite. We feel we followed the rules of the game to the letter.\u201d What followed \u2013 the meat of Belichick\u2019s 23-minute remarks \u2013 was the coach\u2019s most detailed and defiant response to a scandal that has turned the sports world on its head in the week since the Patriots were first accused of tampering with game footballs in their 45-7 AFC Championship win over the Indianapolis Colts. He said the team conducted an internal investigation by simulating a game-day situation in terms of the preparation of footballs. Because science. Belichick expounded, matter-of-factly: When the balls go out on the field into game conditions \u2013 whether it\u2019s hot and humid, whether it\u2019s cold and damp, whether it\u2019s cold and dry \u2013 that\u2019s where the footballs are played with, and that\u2019s where the measurements would be possibly different than what they are in a controlled environment. And that\u2019s what we found. We found that once the balls were on the field over an extended period of time \u2013 they were adjusted to the climatic conditions and also the fact the balls had reached an equilibrium without the rubbing process that had run its course and the footballs had reached an equalibrium \u2013 that they were down approximately 1.5 pounds per square inch. When we brought the footballs back in after that process and re-tested them in a controlled environment as we have here, then those measurements rose approximately 0.5 pounds per square inch. So the net of 1.5 back to 0.5 is about 1 pound per square inch. Really. Now we all know that air pressure is a function of atmospheric conditions. So if there\u2019s activity in the ball relative to the rubbing process, that explains why, when we gave them to the officials and the officials put it at 12.5, then once the ball reached equilibrium state, it was probably was closer to 11.5. Again, those were our measurements, we can\u2019t speak specifically to what happened because we have no way of touching the footballs. Once the officials have them, we don\u2019t touch them except for when we play with them in the game. It\u2019s similar to the concept of when you get into your car and the light comes on and it says \u2018low tire pressure\u2019 because the car has been sitting in the driveway outside overnight and you start it up and you start driving it and the light goes off. It\u2019s a similar process to that. Go on. So atmospheric conditions and true equilibrium of the ball is critical to the measurement. At no time were any of the footballs prepared anywhere other than in the locker room or in an area close to that. Never in a heated room or heated condition. That\u2019s absolutely never taken place to anyone\u2019s knowledge or recollection, and I mean, that\u2019s just ... didn\u2019t happen. The inherent absurdity of the grumpiest man in sports giving a high-school physics lecture to a room of grown men and women aside, the content of the remarks was so breathtakingly insipid it left the observer wondering what they were doing with their life. It was more performance art than routine component in the news-gathering process. Given that Belichick\u2019s defense doesn\u2019t hold up to the most casual scrutiny \u2013 why did it happen to the Patriots\u2019 balls and not those used by the Colts \u2013 this was a master class in creating plausible deniability. Say what you want about congeniality (or the immutability of the laws of thermodynamics), Belichick\u2019s obfuscation game is on 100. That was not to say Saturday\u2019s scene was unreal. Belichick\u2019s detached sangfroid was tested more than once, certainly compared to the far more familiar monotone vagaries of Thursday\u2019s address. He even revisited Spygate, an unimaginable prospect even an hour before. Beneath the bizarre theatre was a man defending the legitimacy of his entire body of work, speaking with a Jessupian vigor grounded in leviathan self-belief. Saturday\u2019s news conference means nothing, in the long run. The NFL did not outline a timetable for its investigation in a statement on Friday and likely won\u2019t move on it until well after the Super Bowl. Which made Belichick\u2019s unnecessary decision to hold it that much more cryptic \u2013 and compelling. Now the Patriots appear proactive. Deflategate isn\u2019t going away \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s Super Bowl media day should be fun \u2013 but once more Bill Belichick has outmaneuvered the NFL and hijacked the narrative to his presumptive advantage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
