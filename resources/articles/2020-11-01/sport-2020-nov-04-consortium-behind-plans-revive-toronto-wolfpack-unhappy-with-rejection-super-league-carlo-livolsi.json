LiVolsi also strongly rebuffed claims that Wolf Grooming, the company behind the takeover of the Wolfpack, refused to show proof of funding and stressed it was willing to invest millions of dollars in the transatlantic operation had they been welcomed back to Super League next season. The consortium\u2019s proposal was rejected by eight votes to four with one abstention, leaving the Wolfpack facing an uncertain future after the pandemic forced them to withdraw in July when the former owner, David Argyle, said he could no longer fund the club. But LiVolsi, who heads the Wolf Grooming consortium, insists he can make the Toronto concept work. That, however, would take a change in attitude and a possible return to talks over a return in 2022. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to play it safe and have certain clubs control the league, instead of what\u2019s best,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be disappointed if they don\u2019t come out and acknowledge they didn\u2019t give us a fair opportunity.\u201d LiVolsi rejected reports that he was unwilling to disclose proof of funding to Super League clubs. The consortium\u2019s final proposal, he claims, allowed for one executive from the Rugby Football League and another from Super League to view financial details after signing a non-disclosure agreement, but only if Wolfpack had been granted a favourable vote on Monday. \u201cWe vehemently deny accusations we refused to disclose financial information,\u201d he said. \u201cNo owners at any stage asked about our proof of funding. At no time from our proposal being submitted to the end of Monday\u2019s meeting was it ever brought up. The owners never discussed it with me during our call.\u201d He added: \u201cWe were committed to investing whatever money was required to make this work. At no time did any owner approach us about that. They had my email and phone number and it was never a discussion point amongst the owners I spoke with. We understood that any approved proposal would require proof of funding from day one.\u201d The consortium also claimed it had agreed to a two-point deduction with the Rugby Football League as punishment for Toronto\u2019s mid-season withdrawal, though some clubs were privately demanding 12 points. The consortium maintains it struck a deal with Super League to ensure that any return would come with full central distribution of funds \u2013 \u00a31.8m \u2013 with the Wolfpack\u2019s previous owners agreeing to forfeit all distribution income. \u201cWe said we wanted equal distribution like everyone else,\u201d LiVolsi said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that we\u2019re paying for other clubs to travel to Toronto and incur those extra costs.\u201d LiVolsi said he did not feel the new consortium should clear the Wolfpack\u2019s historical debts, but he had promised to honour unpaid salaries to players and staff, including the former All Black Sonny Bill Williams. \u201cThe crazy thing is that we would have paid the outstanding salaries owed for 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was part of our proposal and something that the league should have welcomed.\u201d Toronto agreed to forfeit their right to play home matches in 2021 to further strengthen their case, after agreeing to play those fixtures at the 8,000-seater York Community Stadium. \u201cRobert [Elstone, the Super League chief executive] had suggested how he wasn\u2019t a fan of how the previous owner left the league, and we understood that,\u201d LiVolsi said. \u201cHe had concerns about Covid-19 and we agreed to try and remove some of those travel variables from the proposal, to make the losses a bit more realistic. We were going to risk millions of dollars and needed to know if there would be a reward for our risk. \u201cThey [Super League clubs] can\u2019t see the forest from the trees. We could have made money for the players with endorsements of our [Wolf Grooming] products and that would have led to other sponsorships. We would have been in the top 1% of ownerships in the league and were willing to make this work by whatever means. \u201cThey wanted us to pay for the sins of the past and I always felt it was going to be no because of that.\u201d LiVolsi indicated his consortium\u2019s backing for Wolfpack was in the balance now their readmission had been rejected. \u201cUnless someone wants to invest in playing in a league of relegated teams [the Championship] it won\u2019t work for Wolf Grooming. It was Super League or bust. \u201cThere\u2019s still an opportunity to make this work, but they need to change their tune or allow the consortium to put a proposal together for the future. Maybe you expand the league and get rid of some teams that don\u2019t invest in it. If they don\u2019t do that, how can the sport ever prosper?\u201d Super League has declined to comment on LiVolsi\u2019s claims."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
