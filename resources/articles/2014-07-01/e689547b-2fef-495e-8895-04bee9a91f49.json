T. H.\" tells me that the increased motor traffic at Bettws-y-Coed [sic] has destroyed that pest the gooseberry sawfly. In confirmation he tells me that his gardener dusts the infested bushes with fine ash, for he is troubled by the grub on his Stockport trees. There is something in it, for fine dust will clog the respiratory spiracles of the lame and kill them. That I have proved for myself. \"J. G. M.\" writes that his lawn is infested by ground bees, which have their \"hives underneath,\" and wonders how to destroy them, and what kind they are. There are many ground-boring bees, but though most of them are gregarious in habit they are really \"solitary\" bees, each burrow in a colony belonging to one female; there is no hive and no communistic life similar to that of the honey bee. These solitary bees do very little harm to a lawn, although for a time their abundant little earthy outputs may be unsightly. Many of the genus Andrena are exceedingly variable in numbers - they will abound one year and be rare the next. \"T. H. H.\" sends me a large female \"giant tailed-wasp\" (Sirex gigas), which was killed in Altrincham. It is the second I have received within a few days. This insect, often taken for a hornet, is a wood-boring sawfly; its larva does considerable damage by riddling timber, especially that of conifers. Many of these saw-flies reach this country in timber from abroad, especially Scandinavia, and those which cause alarm by their inquisitive buzzing in town offices and workshops have usually emerged from some plank or piece of timber."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
