It followed the personal journeys of a group of young prisoners I worked with in a young offender institution in the south-west. I still work with some of these young men today. I do this work because I'm a long-term rehabilitated offender who wants to give some of the support and love I've received over the past 23 years back to my wider community. Under the title Write to Freedom, we have mentored these young men in the basic survival skills of writing, wilderness awareness and bushcraft. The journey takes us from the harsh, bleak and depressing environment of prison to the stunning wilderness landscape of Dartmoor. We help them escape. A strictly legal escape: guiding each young man through a carefully structured selection process designed to identify those most ready to engage in what we have to offer; to prove they can be trusted outside the prison walls in a wide open landscape, no locks on their bedroom doors, no prison routine to follow. We have run five wilderness and writing weekends on Dartmoor. No one's done a runner. Over the past two years we have worked with more than a hundred young men willing to address the dangerous downward spiral of their lives. Of this number, 22 have made it through the selection process to the wilderness weekends. The weekends involve writing journals, group work, outdoor activities, orientation, bushcraft and identifying key skills that they will need to survive in the world, free from crime. When the day comes for them to walk through the prison gates, Write to Freedom remains a contact point \u2013 and further weekends have been designed to offer a safe and supportive rite of passage and mentoring into a responsible, crime-free adulthood. But they must ask for it. They have to show clear motivation and commitment and prove they are ready. These introductory weekends continue and we are now months away from beginning the first post-release weekend on Dartmoor. The newly formed Write to Freedom educational charity needs money to make this happen. We are running a parallel project on the lifers' wing in the same prison. Getting young men out on to Dartmoor is a breeze compared with the logistical problems of getting this project off the ground within the prison walls. The majority of the young men on the lifers' wing are held inside for the purposes of public protection. For them, release on temporary licence to come up on to Dartmoor is out of the question. As a result we are designing a wilderness and writing weekend inside the prison. The landscape clearly doesn't compare to the moors but the young lifers will be camping within the prison grounds within sight of the few trees dotted around the heavily secure compound. We will build a fire for them to sit round and talk and share stories and the harsh security lights where we are camping will be briefly switched off so they can, some for the first time since being jailed, see the stars. There will be activities identical to the ones on the moors, save the sweet freedom to be able walk for miles in a straight line. These young men have committed very serious crimes and are paying the price with the loss of their freedom. One prisoner is 15 years old and looking at a minimum of nine years before his first parole date. Each young prisoner has had a traumatic, sometimes horrific upbringing. The focus of the work we do is on meeting them where they are at, finding ways to support them and help them break the destructive patterns of their lives. And when they're ready, rehabilitation begun, sentence complete, they can re-enter society hopefully with the ability and desire to support others just like them and perhaps help make this world a better and safer place to live. \u2022 Caspar Walsh is a journalist and author and founder of the charity Write to Freedom.
