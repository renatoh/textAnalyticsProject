He was 77. In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Romero\u2019s producing partner Peter Grunwald said the director died in his sleep after a \u201cbrief but aggressive battle with lung cancer\u201d. Night of the Living Dead, a micro-budget zombie film combining horror and social satire, which Romero co-wrote with John Russo, was released in 1968 and became a cult classic. It spawned a series: Dawn of the Dead (1978), Day of the Dead (1985), Land of the Dead (2005), Diary of the Dead (2007) and Survival of the Dead. The last was released in 2009. Romero was born in the Bronx, in New York City, on 4 February 1940, to a Cuban father and a Lithuanian-American mother. He began his filmmaking career as a commercial director before finding his niche in horror. Indelibly associated with the zombie movie, he came to be seen as a master of the entire genre. The label did not weigh heavy. In an interview with the AV Club in 2008, Romero said: \u201cEverybody asks Stephen King how he feels about Hollywood ruining his books, and the first thing he says is, \u2018The books aren\u2019t ruined. Here they are, on the shelf behind me.\u2019 And I sorta feel the same way. My stuff is my stuff. Sometimes it\u2019s not as successful as some of the other stuff. But it\u2019s my stuff.\u201d In a 2014 interview with NPR, Romero said he \u201cnever expected\u201d his career to be defined by zombies. \u201cAll I did was I took them out of \u2018exotica\u2019 and I made them the neighbors,\u201d he said, pointing to the success of his uncanny and chilling films that used terrifying effects, makeup and cuts to satirise consumerism, racism and other social horrors. \u201cI thought there\u2019s nothing scarier than the neighbors!\u201d The year before, Romero told the Daily Telegraph his films \u201cmay have started the ramp\u201d in terms of zombie films being seen as money-making propositions. \u201cI used to be the only guy in the playground,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, my God. I do think the popularity of the creature has come from video games, not film. \u201cZombieland, which was relatively recent, was the first zombie film to break $100m at the box office, and therefore got Hollywood interested. The [2004] remake of Dawn of the Dead did about $75m, so I think that may have started the ramp. And then Zombieland and now, of course, World War Z. But dozens of hugely popular video games have had a bigger impact.\u201d Romero operated on budgets that shrank in comparison to such profits: Dawn of the Dead cost $114,000 and Dawn of the Dead, its widely loved sequel, was made for just $500,000. He was a co-writer on the Zack Snyder-directed 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, which cost $28m and ended up taking several times more worldwide. He also discussed with the Telegraph why he didn\u2019t like The Walking Dead, the zombie TV hit that continues at the same time as a spin-off, Fear the Walking Dead, and which he described as \u201ca soap opera with a zombie occasionally\u201d. King was among many tributes to Romero on social media on Sunday. Guillermo del Toro, director of Chronos, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, The Devil\u2019s Backbone and other horror classics, wrote: \u201cRomero has passed away. Hard to find words right now. The loss is so enormous.\u201d Bruce Campbell, star of Sam Raimi\u2019s The Evil Dead, wrote: Eli Roth, director of Cabin Fever and Hostel, wrote: \u201cHard to quantify how much he inspired me and what he did for cinema \u2026 \u201cRomero used genre to confront racism 50 years ago. He always had diverse casts, with Duane Jones as the heroic star of NOTLD. Very few others in cinema were taking such risks. He was both ahead of his time and exactly what cinema needed at that time.\u201d From Britain, the horror author and critic Kim Newman wrote: \u201cIt is impossible to overestimate the impact George A Romero had on the horror film.\u201d Reece Shearsmith, of the horror-influenced comedy group The League of Gentleman, said: \u201cNothing has frightened me more than when I first watched Night of the Living Dead. RIP. An amazing man.\u201d Shearsmith and Mark Gatiss, another member of the League, also paid tribute to a film outside the Living Dead series. Gatiss wrote: \u201cA fond farewell to charming, legendary zombie king George Romero. Martin is one of my favourite horrors. An honour to have met him. RIP.\u201d Martin, another hugely influential film from 1978, concerns a misunderstood teenager who thinks he is a vampire. Romero married three times. His family told the LA Times he died with his wife, Suzanne Desrocher Romero, and daughter Tina Romero at his side while listening to the score of the John Ford\u2019s 1952 film, The Quiet Man, one of his favourites."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
