You can\u2019t reach a final without suffering and it\u2019s even better like this. Well, maybe not for the heart. But it is.\u201d Asked what his team have that means somehow they always find a way through, Zidane replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the team, it\u2019s the club. It\u2019s a history that comes from a long way back and now it\u2019s a history we are writing, just as those other teams did. This team never surrenders. We know it is hard but we believe in what we do and keep fighting. \u201cI feel very good, because when you do something like this it\u2019s very nice. We like football because of this kind of emotion. We still haven\u2019t won anything, but we\u2019re in the final and that\u2019s enormous. We can be happy because it\u2019s not normal to be in the final for a third year in a row.\u201d For Bayern, there was sadness and disbelief. For Arturo Vidal, there was also anger. Injured and watching on television, he responded on social media to a possible handball from Marcelo, by typing \u201cFucking penalty\u201d, accompanied by 17 angry-face emojis. The defender himself admitted afterwards that he too thought it was a handball. There was regret too over the way they gifted Real their second goal \u2013 all the more so after two errors led to goals in the first leg. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely bitter feeling,\u201d Mats Hummels said. \u201cWe had chances in the first game, we were more dangerous today but in the end Real made fewer big mistakes.\u201d Thomas M\u00fcller added: \u201cWe gifted a goal and you cannot have it happen twice in a semi-final like this. We lacked a lot of luck, especially in the box. We should not be ashamed but it hurts a lot to have missed the chance. We invested so much and there are so many guys who deserve to play in a final.\u201d Jupp Heynckes said after his final European match: \u201cI never had the any intention of returning to the bench and now it is definitive that I will not be on a bench again. I won\u2019t be back, I won\u2019t be at another Champions League game. There aren\u2019t many people who go on an adventure like this at 72. But I\u2019m disappointed because the players have not got the reward they deserved.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
