The IMF, which voiced strong misgivings about a vote for Brexit before the EU referendum, said it expected the UK economy to grow by 1.3% in 2017, 0.9 percentage points lower than an estimate made in its World Economic Outlook (WEO), in April. While the fund is ruling out a full-blown recession, the analysis by one of the leading global economic bodies underlines the financial challenges facing Theresa May\u2019s government during a period when slower growth will lead to lower tax receipts and a bigger budget deficit. On Wednesday in Berlin, the prime minister will hold talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Both are keen to minimise the economic fallout of Brexit. Germany, with its heavy reliance on exports, is seen by the IMF as the most vulnerable eurozone country following Britain\u2019s vote. May is expected to warn that she needs time to consult with the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as industry sectors, before starting formal negotiations with Brussels. Tomorrow she goes to France for a meeting with the president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, where she will deliver a similar message about the need to resist triggering article 50 until Britain is fully prepared for talks. May and her ministers are keen to talk up the prospects for the economy, with the upbeat response from the Treasury to the IMF report contrasting with the pessimistic tone that had been adopted under George Osborne in the weeks leading up to the EU referendum. A Treasury spokesman said overtures from Australia about a trade deal and the willingness of Softbank to pay \u00a324bn for the technology firm ARM showed the UK could make a success of Brexit. \u201cThe decision to leave the EU marks a new phase for the British economy, but our message is this: our country remains open for business. We are the same outward-looking, globally minded, big-thinking country we have always been.\u201d The IMF urged policymakers in the UK and rest of the EU to end the uncertainty. \u201cOf primary importance is a smooth and predictable transition to a new set of post-exit trading and financial relationships that as much as possible preserves gains from trade between the UK and the EU.\u201d The IMF said it had cut its forecasts for the global economy due to the likely knock-on effect of the vote on other countries, particularly in Europe. Maury Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said: \u201cThe first half of 2016 revealed some promising signs \u2013 stronger than expected growth in the euro area and Japan, as well as a partial recovery in commodity prices that helped several emerging and developing economies. \u201cAs of 22 June [the day before the referendum], we were therefore prepared to upgrade our 2016-17 global growth projections slightly. But Brexit has thrown a spanner in the works.\u201d The IMF predicted global growth of 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017, both of which were 0.1 points lower than forecast in April. Britain is still expected to be the second fastest growing economy in the G7 this year \u2013 behind the US, despite having its growth forecast for 2016 trimmed by 0.2 percentage points to 1.7%. The IMF believes that next year the UK will have similar growth rates to Germany \u2013 the eurozone economy most affected by the Brexit-induced slowdown \u2013 and France. Germany\u2019s growth is now estimated at 1.2% in 2017, a fall of 0.4 points. It said: \u201cThe vote in the UK in favour of leaving the EU adds significant uncertainty to an already fragile global recovery. The vote has caused significant political change in the UK, generated uncertainty about the nature of its future economic relations with the EU, and could heighten political risks in the union itself. Continuing uncertainty is likely to weigh on consumption and especially investment.\u201d The WEO update said there was a risk that the impact of the UK\u2019s decision to leave could prove worse than expected. \u201cWith Brexit still very much unfolding, the extent of economic and political uncertainty has risen, and the likelihood of outcomes more negative than the one in the baseline has increased.\u201d The IMF outlined two alternative scenarios to its forecast, one moderately worse, one significantly. However, Obstfeld said the resilience of financial markets since 23 June meant that the fund was putting \u201cless weight\u201d on gloomy forecasts. A forecast from the European commission, however, was less sanguine. In its first post-Brexit assessment, the commission said the UK would, at best, grow by 1.1% in 2017, but there was a risk that the economy could contract by 0.3%. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said of the announcement: \u201cToday\u2019s report from the IMF is another blow for the government and further highlights that they had no plan whatsoever for after a Brexit vote.\u201d Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said that if the IMF forecast were right, the UK economy would be \u00a321bn smaller than thought: \u201cA \u00a321bn [cut] in the \u2026 economy alone would reduce the tax take by \u00a3150m a week.\u201d The Adam Smith Institute said the \u201crebooting\u201d of the economy after Brexit should include the scrapping of corporation tax, abolition of subsidies for farmers, and protection of Britain\u2019s fishing waters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
