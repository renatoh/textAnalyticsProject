But that is what has happened. The lack of buzz around London fashion week was in complete contrast to the frenzy that surrounded the red carpets and aftershow parties of the Baftas and the Brits. Once upon a time, the silliest clothes of London fashion week were guaranteed to make the front pages. But this week's headline-grabbing outfits came courtesy of The Darkness. A stark reflection on London fashion week's glamour rating: of all the A-listers in town doing the awards circuit this week, including Scarlett Johansson, Beyonc\u00e9 and Justin Timberlake, not one bothered to grace the audience of a single catwalk show. In Paris, Milan and New York, catwalk front rows are considered great publicity - but not here, clearly. But before we embark on the fashion media's ritual London-bashing, it is worth recognising a more widespread malaise. A clash with the Oscars has led the mighty Donatella Versace to change the date of her show this season, in a frank admission that even her catwalk, front row and party - the most glamorous of the season - cannot compete. The irony is that fashion, as the breeding ground of the supermodel, the It girl and the power stylist, helped to create the cult of celebrity. And now, like a cuckoo in the nest, the cult of celebrity is starving fashion of attention. An additional problem for London is that, for the past three or four years, it has been at the bottom of the list of prestigious fashion cities. So that now, when there is not enough enthusiasm for fashion to go round, London suffers most. To be a success, a fashion week not only needs great clothes, but the right buyers and international editors there to see them and to convert the applause into hard currency. This is what London is sorely lacking - and it will continue to be, until it can nurture and hold on to labels that have enough critical and commercial success to make them must-sees. It is a real shame that, in the light of all this, the actual clothes on the catwalk seemed an afterthought, because they were rather lovely. In fact, in terms of design, it felt like something of a breakthrough week. Too often, London fashion week can appear to be a stand-off between young designers competing over who can show the daftest clothes in the draughtiest and most badly lit venue and an old guard whose shows can have a frustrating lack of ambition. This week, however, had young designers giving us wonderfully grown-up clothes, as well as stalwart names livening up the official tented venue with fresh, modern clothes. A good catwalk collection has to find a balance. It should not, to my mind, look (as many New York collections do) like a posh size-6 version of clothes you could find in any decent branch of Gap or M&amp;S. But neither should it look (as many London collections have done in the past) like a mad professor's fashion laboratory where one crucial factor - that women need to wear these clothes - has been forgotten. A bit of imagination on the part of a fashion designer is essential; too much is just self-indulgent. Four designers in particular showed markedly more considered, useful, refined clothes than the audience expected. First, House of Jazz broadened its sights beyond its captive audience of Hoxton, with an elegant and judiciously edited collection of slinky, monochrome clothes inspired by Princess Leia of Star Wars and Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra. A black silk dress with Obi-like waist section and a cascade of black panels from the waist had the buyers sitting up and taking notice, and a sensible-looking range of bags further indicated serious intentions from this label. Then there was Sophia Kokosalaki, who occupies a traditionally precarious position in London. She is no longer new enough to be assured of media interest, but her name is not yet widely enough known to be sure of success without it. This season showed a move forward: the beautifully offbeat wrap-and-fold dresses were still there, but so were elegant trousers, short jackets and separates. Giles Deacon, along with Jonathan Saunders (of whom more later), commandeered what little buzz there was around the week's shows. And for once, believe the hype: it was refreshing to see a designer who, by working in the industry for 12 years first rather than launching his label straight out of college, spared us the cringe-worthy puckered seams and misguided whims of so many too-young hopefuls. Instead, Deacon has cut straight to the part where he appreciates skilful workmanship, and knows how to reference retro periods without copying or mocking them. Hurrah. Last of this particular fab four was Julien Macdonald, who, as he threatened to leave London fashion week for Milan, was determined to show us what we might be missing. In the past, Macdonald's models have been so underdressed that being in the front row is very much like being lapdanced. It seems that Macdonald has finally realised that there is more to sexy clothes than the surface area of flesh. And so to the other highlights. Like Deacon, Alice Temperley is a designer who mercifully seems to have arrived on the scene fully fledged, sparing us the catwalk-channelled post-adolescent angst. The sumptuous setting of the Park Lane Hotel ballroom was perfect for dresses that are delectably pretty without being in any way coy. An apricot chiffon wrap-front dress edged with black beading looked perfect for the beauties of the early-20th-century Parisian demi-monde who inspired the collection. Clements Ribeiro are an excellent advert for London fashion week, their collections having hit form once again since their return from Paris. There is far too much fur for my taste, but a matchless eye for stunning colour combinations and texture, as in a simple tweed grey skirt suit with multicoloured sequin trim. Betty Jackson, also, is adept at giving clothes edge and luxury with unusual colours and textures. A cream leather trenchcoat worn over a sparkling dress; a belted coffee-meets-mauve coat with deep trim of grape sequins. Lastly, special mention to Jonathan Saunders. He is a crazy young thing, in the grand St Martins tradition. The murky colours and supertight cut do not make for a very wearable collection, but it was a darn sight more wearable than last season, which is a step in the right direction, and it is utterly original. But, sadly, I do not think there is much chance of seeing it on the red carpet at the Oscars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
