He had ample reason to believe the England manager was preparing to deliver bad news. After being appointed captain in March 2017 Cahill found himself out of Southgate\u2019s plans a year later, omitted from the squad for two friendlies and struggling for form at Chelsea. \u201cI thought potentially it could be bad news because in my experience of being involved with England for seven or eight years you usually don\u2019t get the call \u2013 you just receive the information that you\u2019re going to meet up and what times,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cSo to get the call a different way, I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t a little bit nervous.\u201d Cahill was driving to training at the time, preparing for Chelsea\u2019s FA Cup final against Manchester United, and his thoughts were occupied by that fixture rather than the World Cup. \u201cI was desperate to go and be in the squad like anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was in the week leading up to the cup final so my emotions were all over the place. My mental state was fully focused on this final. That\u2019s all I was thinking about. And then that came along and obviously I was delighted to get the news. There were a lot of emotions for me in that particular week and both turned out to be very good news. So let\u2019s hope that carries on into the summer.\u201d One of the hallmarks of Southgate\u2019s tenure as manager so far has been the way he has communicated with his players, even when delivering bad news. He phoned Jack Wilshere, Ryan Bertrand and Joe Hart to let the trio know they did not feature in his plans for Russia. Cahill was extended the same courtesy when he was left out of a 27-man squad for friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March this year. It was a significant fall from prominence for the defender who Southgate had chosen to wear the captain\u2019s armband against Germany in Berlin in March 2017 and played a key role in England\u2019s World Cup qualification campaign. But Southgate had grown concerned at Cahill\u2019s reduced role at Stamford Bridge, particularly after he was dropped from Chelsea\u2019s defence after costly errors in Premier League games. As a result, the phone call did not come as a shock. \u201cHe spoke to me before he left me out. I respected him a lot for that phone call because I\u2019d sooner find out from the horse\u2019s mouth than anywhere else and nothing surprises me in football,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cEveryone is judged in months and weeks. You have a month where you score two or three goals and you\u2019re the best thing since sliced bread. Or you have a month where you make a couple of errors and you\u2019re finished. That\u2019s the kind of way things go. \u201cI played the majority of qualifying games for two years and then I was left out for the World Cup squad in 2014 when it was announced. Other people were in form, playing well, it is what it is. The thing I keep harping back to is dig into your character and make sure you perform well for your club to give yourself the opportunity. That\u2019s all I tried to do. At that moment I took a knock \u2013 it\u2019s not the first I\u2019ve taken and I\u2019ve had a lot of good times in football. I just needed to work harder, get in the team and show what I could do. On the last day of the season I lifted the Cup and there was the turnaround. It can happen quickly.\u201d With 58 international caps Cahill is the most experienced member of the 23-man squad which will have an average age of 26 on 18 June when England play their first group game. He is also one of only 10 players in the squad who featured in England\u2019s Euro 2016 campaign which ended with a humiliating defeat by Iceland. He insisted he would not be carrying mental scars from that early exit. \u201cIt depends on your personality and character. If you\u2019re asking me that now I won\u2019t even think of that when I\u2019m over there. I will in the aspect of not want to experience that feeling again \u2013 it will just make me more determined to do well. \u201cThat game was so frustrating because we had unbelievable amounts of possession yet we never created anything with it. It took a long time to get over that. But we can\u2019t harp on about the past, we\u2019re looking to the future and we\u2019re going into this tournament with a positive frame of mind. I think that\u2019s the key for everybody whether you\u2019re an England fan \u2013 or yourselves \u2013 to go in with a more positive attitude and we\u2019ll see how far we can go.\u201d The squad were enjoying the sunshine at St George\u2019s Park, the FA\u2019s centre of excellence on Monday. After a morning training session they posed for photographs for official FA promotional material, with Phil Jones still sporting a black eye he sustained during the FA Cup final. Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold won\u2019t join up with the rest of the squad until Saturday at the earliest after featuring in Liverpool\u2019s Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid. But their club mate Adam Lallana, who is one of four players on standby, is expected to report early to the squad get-together on Wednesday, waiving the extra days Southgate was willing to let him take after the Champions League final. It is understood he wants to prove he is fit should someone drop out. The 30 year old came off the bench to replace the injured Mo Salah after 30 minutes in Kiev and is thought to be next in line to travel to Russia if any of the midfielders or forwards are forced to drop out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
