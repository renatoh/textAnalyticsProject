You aren't missing a thing in the UK - honest. It is cold, damp and wet. I have been reading and enjoying your weekly reports - they all sound very interesting and brilliant fun. I can see why you won; you're a brilliant writer. It was also good to read about your time in Nepal as I've been there myself, and it was all so familiar. I'm sure you could get a job as a travel writer when you return (if you do return...) I am sure you are having some very exciting times and I look forward to reading your continuing adventures with your bear. I am sure he is great to cuddle up to in those more homesick moments. I have never considered Malaysia, but shall have to explore it now as it does sound interesting. Happy travelling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
