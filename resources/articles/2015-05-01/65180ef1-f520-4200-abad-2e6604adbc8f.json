As has become customary, the European Tour\u2019s annual gala dinner in London on Tuesday night gave a nod to Ryder Cup success. In this case, relating to last September\u2019s demolition of the USA at Gleneagles. There was a break from custom, though. McGinley, the widely lauded winning captain, presented limited-edition imagery to his team members, their caddies, the vice-captains and Ferguson. The legendary Manchester United manager took to the stage, where he recalled being \u201cright into this\u201d from the occasion of a lunchtime meeting with McGinley in Alderley Edge which revealed the detail of the Irishman\u2019s preparation. \u201cI think great leaders plan better than anyone,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cFor the players, if they take it in, it\u2019s a great route to success.\u201d Ferguson revelled in his Ryder Cup role, which involved the delivering of a key team talk in Perthshire. Thereafter, he remained as part of the European inner sanctum. \u201cIt was my greatest experience outside of cup finals,\u201d added the Scot. \u201cIt was simply fantastic.\u201d The enjoyment was mutual and mutually beneficial. \u201cI think it was very fitting,\u201d said McIlroy of the extension of a gift to Ferguson. \u201cI think I got more out of that talk on that Ryder Cup Tuesday night than some of the other players did because I had met Alex a few times and I knew him a little bit. \u201cTo be sitting there having a team talk from him, being such a huge United fan and a huge fan of his over the years, it was a special way to start the week. \u201cIt was nice that Alex came up on stage and got properly recognised. And as Paul said, he leaned on him quite a bit during a 12- to 18-month period. I\u2019m sure that Paul learnt a lot from him. But I think at the same time, Alex was very impressed with what Paul had to say and what his ideas were. I think they worked very well together.\u201d Individual rather than team matters will occupy McIlroy\u2019s thoughts over the coming days as he attempts to successfully defend the BMW PGA Championship he concedes was won in \u201cslightly weird\u201d circumstances last May. The immediate precursor to that single-shot victory was McIlroy\u2019s calling off of his engagement to Caroline Wozniacki. Whether directly linked or otherwise, the Northern Irishman has been in routinely inspired on-course form ever since. His personal life barely merits a mention, partly on account of obvious contentment. \u201cThis is what kick-started everything, really,\u201d McIlroy admitted. \u201cThis win, it gave me a lot of confidence to go on into the summer and do what I did. It was a real catalyst. \u201cI felt like I was playing well before that, but I wasn\u2019t able to turn good finishes into wins. I was finishing in the top 10 or top five but I wasn\u2019t really contending too much in tournaments. So, for it to be the first tournament of the year where I got myself sort of into contention and to play a back nine on Sunday like I did last year, it did a lot for my confidence. \u201cWho knows, if I hadn\u2019t of had this tournament things might have been a little bit different. It definitely was the start of a great 12 months.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s victory at Quail Hollow on Sunday, his second in three starts, strengthened his position at the summit of the world rankings. For now, the 26-year-old is untouchable. It is in the present McIlroy wishes to remain. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019m unbeatable, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cGolf is a very fickle game and it can humble you quite quickly. So I definitely don\u2019t think I\u2019m unbeatable. Do I feel like I intimidate others? I feel like my name now carries a certain weight on the leaderboard. I don\u2019t know if you call that intimidation but I feel that if players see my name on the leaderboard now, it might mean a little bit more than it used to.\u201d His issue this time around may be fatigue. McIlroy\u2019s hectic schedule of competitive events added to sponsorship and media commitments looked to have taken a toll on him by Wednesday afternoon. Unusually, the 26-year-old was a tad weary having just completed pro-am business in the company of Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and the One Direction singer Niall Horan. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much adrenaline in the body today,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cOnce I step on the tee tomorrow with a card in my hand, that will be different.\u201d If not, maybe he could call upon Ferguson for another motivational message."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
