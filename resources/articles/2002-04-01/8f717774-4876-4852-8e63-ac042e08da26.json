Just once in the first half -hour was there a moment of alarm, when Vaughan, seeking an injudicious quick single, was sent back by Thorpe and would have been run out had Tuffey hit the stumps After eight overs, Drum was replaced by Andre Adams for his first bowl in Test cricket. Before his third over was up, he had his first wicket: Vaughan caught behind The Finn brothers from Crowded House had been at the match yesterday and, if New Zealand's captain Stephen Fleming had seen them in their Eden Park hospitality box, he might well have found himself drawn into humming Now We're Getting Somewhere from their debut album... by the close of another rain-shortened day New Zealand certainly were Only 28 overs were possible in two blocks after overnight rain and morning showers. But it was time enough for New Zealand to take their first-innings total from 151 for five to 202, a healthy total given the disastrous start that saw them lose four wickets for 19 on Saturday. Even if their last five wickets fell for 30 runs in a flurry as they looked to score freely, there was still enough in the pitch, under cover for the best part of two days, to interest their own seamers Fleming's bowlers did not disappoint. To English embarrassment, and without a run on the board, Marcus Trescothick went palpably lbw to Tuffey's second ball of the innings and Mark Butcher, just as he had in the first over of the series in Christchurch, went to the fifth delivery, popping a catch to short leg, once more without scoring Nasser Hussain then found himself confronted by five slips, a gully and a short leg. Any prospect of him repeating his heroics of Jade Stadium - where he made a match-winning century - disappeared when he edged a fine delivery from Drum to Fleming at first slip, who pouched the chance and turned to his dressing room in triumph as if Bradman himself had been sent packing Vaughan and Thorpe survived the remainder of that, the sixth, over and most of the next before the umpires deemed the light unsuitable. At 12 for three, England it was who were now deep in trouble After Andy Caddick's opening spell on Saturday England have not performed to a sufficiently high standard on a helpful pitch. Chris Harris in particular was able to settle into his innings by being allowed to let too many deliveries pass through to the keeper The sixth-wicket stand that had pulled New Zealand round, worth 65 overnight, was to produce 21 more runs before Andy Flintoff was brought on to bowl down breeze and immediately, not to say dubiously - the ball pitched a considerable distance outside the left-hander's leg stump - had Harris leg before The batsman can have had no genuine grounds for complaint, though, given that he was caught but given not out when 28, but England will hardly appreciate the swings-and-roundabouts argument: Harris's 71, made in 4 hours and equalling his Test best, had turned the game round. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
