My first instinct says hawk \u2013 maybe a peregrine, even (I saw one over the river, among the Victorian chimneys of the Lower Aire, earlier in the week). But then mind and eye resolve the image and I see the bird for what it is: a wood pigeon, southward bound. Seen clearly, looking portly and awkward on a bird table, say, or crashing about in the woodland canopy, the wood pigeon could hardly appear less predatory. But we\u2019re not the only ones who can be fooled by that muscular flight-shape. \u201cIt sometimes has a singularly hawk-like appearance,\u201d the Victorian naturalist WH Hudson wrote. \u201cEven the wild birds in the wood may be deceived by it, and thrown for a few moments into a violent commotion.\u201d Late autumn is the season of multitudes. Rooks and jackdaws muster into vast mixed roosts, starling murmurations throw shifting M\u00f6bius shapes against the dusk, wetlands thrum with the wingbeats of thousands of waders and waterfowl \u2013 and the wood pigeons are on the move, in huge numbers. A vis-migger (that is, a visible-migrant surveyor) might log a flock of 5,000 in an hour of first-light sky-watching here in West Yorkshire. What is curious is that no one really knows where all the wood pigeons are going (or, for that matter, where exactly they\u2019re coming from). The bearing is typically south or west \u2013 beyond that, we can\u2019t be sure. They might be in search of balmier conditions in Cornwall or Devon, but those areas show no corresponding uptick in wood pigeon numbers in winter; alternatively, they might be headed for the rich oak woods of France or Spain. Winters in Britain aren\u2019t as hard for these birds as they once were; oilseed rape, cultivated intensively across the countryside, now supplements their winter diet of acorn and beechmast. But I watch the lone wood pigeon barrelling fast across the white, and think of the winter peregrines that haunt the upper air here now. Death would be sudden and explosive, arriving unseen out of the pale sun. Follow Country diary on Twitter: @GdnCountryDiary"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
