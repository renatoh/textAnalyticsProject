Aware: Art Fashion Identity is the latest. A triumph of well-mannered exhibition design, and the work of four curators, as a whole the show feels dull, empty and predictable. This is not the significant contribution to the complex subject of dress and culture, tradition and confrontation, clothing as habitation or as performance of identity it claims to be. It feels weirdly lifeless. Yinka Shonibare's Victorian childrenswear made from his usual African wax-printed batiks, a 2004 cape that Grayson Perry made for himself (part wizard's cloak, part clerical drag), a very early Cindy Sherman film (more curio than significant artwork) and Gillian Wearing's Turner prize-winning 1996 film of a bunch of uniformed coppers grouped in a filmed portrait, don't add much to a complicated subject. You know what you are going to get, and we have already got it, thanks. Palestinian artist Sharif Waked's 2003 Chic Point video, a fashion show of specially designed clothes to wear when going through Israeli checkpoints \u2013 to avoid the humiliation of having to undress before leering soldiers \u2013 is great, but there are too many one-off exhibits that are made to stand for big issues or as tokens of entire and complex careers. A dress by Alexander McQueen, Rosemarie Trockel's 1988 Schizo-Pullover with two turtlenecks and Helen Storey's dissolvable frock \u2013 hung on an arty scaffold that can subject the fragile garment to trial by water \u2013 just look like novelties. A single Andreas Gursky digitally manipulated photograph of identically dressed Kuwaitis may be engaging, but it merely confirms a stereotype. This frustrating exhibition does very little for art, or fashion, or our sense of what clothes can be or what they might mean."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
