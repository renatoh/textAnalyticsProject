The back streets and alleys around Changyang Road in the eastern part of central Shanghai do not have the stores and restaurants that the Las Vegas-style city centre has. As the enormous afternoon sun disappears behind the old concrete houses with little balconies covered in hanging laundry, the sultry 25-degree heat becomes just a little less stifling. The exhaust fumes and the dust hang heavy in the air, shut in by the narrow streets and chaotic traffic. Locals cook dinner on charcoal cookers and mend their bicycles in the street here and the excited bargaining for vegetables and bicycle parts can be heard in almost every alley. A barbed wired wall surrounds Tilanqiao prison, where internet engineer and journalist Linhai was held for six months in 1999 after a year in a detention centre. His crime? Using the internet in a way that the ruling Communist party deemed a threat to stability. On March 25 1998, Linhai's wife, Xu Hong, received a phone call at work from Linhai's father, who told her that the Chinese secret police had arrested Linhai. \"When I got home all of Linhai's equipment was gone,\" Ms Hong says. \"He was gone, everything was gone. They had taken his computers, printers, papers and even some books.\" Since China started permitting commercial internet accounts in 1995, the internet has been a scourge for the Chinese Communist party as it struggles to control the country's media in the name of \"social stability\". In July 2001, President Jiang Zemin, who the New York-based Commission to Protect Journalists have on their top-10 list of \"enemies of press freedom\", condemned the spread of \"pernicious information\" on the internet and said the country's internet laws and regulations were \"inadequate\". It is a crime to send \"secret\" or \"reactionary\" material over the internet in China, and it is illegal to discuss topics that \"damage the reputation of the state\". These broadly termed regulations make it easy for the party to arrest or punish anyone who uses material that the party deems improper. On a telephone from New York, where he now lives, Linhai says he became involved in the movement for a free Chinese media by chance. \"I wanted to become an astronaut when I was 11 because I saw the American space missions on television. I studied science at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics six years later. But then I started using the internet, and the very nature of the internet is freedom of expression.\" He says most educated people in China understand that they are not being told the truth by most of the media, which are forced to promote and support the party line. Linhai wanted to create a platform for free expression. He says he was one of the first internet users in China, and that the government wanted to make an example of him. He was working at home when Shanghai police and several government officials burst in. A special internet monitoring unit of China's secret police had tracked him. They did not tell him why he was arrested. \"I knew I might be in trouble,\" he says. \"But I never thought I would have to go to jail. I was interrogated but never told why I was there. I was constantly abused verbally. They threatened me and my family. I was told I would be beaten or would have to spend a long time in prison. \"They said my family would suffer. If I did not give the interrogators the answers they wanted, they kept me from going to sleep for long periods of time. The living standards were abuse in themselves. We were several persons in a very small area and were only given small portions of cold rice.\" After a three-month closed trial beginning in December 1998, Linhai was convicted of \"subversion of state power\". He had submitted over 30,000 email addresses of potential subscribers to VIP Reference, a Washington DC and New York-based news site run by Chinese students and scholars. The site is part of the Chinese political opposition and banned in China. He was sentenced to two years in prison and sent to Tilanqiao on March 23 1999. It is one of China's most notorious prisons, built during the British colonial period. \"I remember the first night in the cell. I had to share it with three others. It was horrible. A standard cell is two metres long, one and a half metres wide and two metres high. There was no bed, no water and no toilet in the cell. During the whole time, I shared my cell with at least one other prisoner. Mostly, there were at least three of us.\" Linhai's wife had tried to hire a lawyer to handle the case, but he could not get enough information and was warned by authorities against taking the case. As a result of Linhai's arrest, Ms Hong had lost her job and the secret police had started tracking her. In Tilanqiao, she was allowed to visit her husband once a month. She had not been told where he was while he was held in the detention centre. \"It was difficult to see Linhai for the first time in one year,\" she says. \"I thought he looked okay but we were not able to talk about what had happened and what it was like for him inside. There was always a guard listening.\" Linhai says that despite the living standards and \"the fear of living in a prison\", he coped well. \"As long as I did not cause trouble I was left alone. I was treated as special. For example, all the other prisoners had to do hard, manual labour every day without pay. I did not have to do that.\" Linhai was released early, on September 23 1999. He says that directly after his time in prison, he stayed at home a lot and sometimes travelled to remote areas to find peace. He failed to restart his career. The police visited him regularly to keep track of his activities. \"I felt there was nothing left for me in China. I knew I was not going to be able to do what I wanted, to work as an internet journalist, and I decided to leave two years ago.\" Today, he is working on \"technical internet projects\" in New York City. His wife and five-year-old son still live in Shanghai. None of them know what they are going to do. Ms Hong says they will wait and see, that they want life to quieten down and maybe then they will move back together in Shanghai or New York. Linhai says he wants to make his dream come true in New York. He has all citizen's rights on paper in China, but like every citizen except government officials, he says in reality, he has no rights. \"Life is a little out of control. But you have to believe it will eventually work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
