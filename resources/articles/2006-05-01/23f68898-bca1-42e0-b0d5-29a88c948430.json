The memorial will be constructed on the north side of the Mall in London between Marlborough Road and Admiralty Arch. There were more than 70 expressions of interest in the project and the five selected have very different approaches. In August, the shortlisted designs will be submitted to the selection panel and the Prince of Wales. The project is being managed by the royal household, in association with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The \"community cantata\" On Spital Fields, by Jonathan Dove, which was the highlight of last year's Spitalfields Festival, has won the Royal Philharmonic Society music award for education. Commissioned by the festival, the work involved 300 people aged nine to 90. More than 180 performers sang the words of Dickens, Dryden, Pepys and Blake, conjuring up the history of the neighbourhood from Roman burials and rioting silk weavers to Petticoat Lane market. Philip Flood, education director of the festival, said the project would not have been possible without the \"commitment and enthusiasm of the young people and adults of Tower Hamlets and east London\". Actor Vince Vaughn has denied reports that he is to marry Brad Pitt's ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston, in an $8m celebration to be thrown by talkshow host Oprah Winfrey. The Wedding Crashers star has been linked to Aniston since they began shooting a movie, The Break-Up, together but both have refused to confirm they are a couple. Vaughn, appearing on Oprah's eponymous show, said Aniston was one of his \"favourite people\", adding: \"She's just really smart and funny and easy to be with - very considerate.\" He jokingly thanked Oprah for the wedding offer, and said he and Aniston were not planning any children yet. \"First we have to have the $8m wedding.\" Works by sculptors Tony Cragg and Jane and Louise Wilson will be exhibited at the Lisson Gallery in London from May 17. Cragg will present eight large works in bronze and stainless steel as well as works made from red Turkish marble and diabas stone. Jane and Louise Wilson's exhibition, entitled The New Brutalists, will include the first UK showing of the five-screen installation Erewhon, as well as new photographic works. jacqueline.maley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
