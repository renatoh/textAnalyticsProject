The park ranger behind me cleared her throat. \u201cYeah, watch out because they jum\u2013\u201d The shiniest eyes bugged out, followed by a little furry body. An Australian northern quoll is fast, spotty and critically endangered. Ginger Meggs landed deftly on my neck, scuttled across my shoulders and flattened his body against my wrist. Normal quoll behaviour? \u201cHe\u2019s feeling your pulse,\u201d the ranger told me. She asked if maybe I was a calm sort of a person because he stayed there, belly warm against wrist, reading my blood. No one has ever described me as calm. In the human world, I\u2019m excitable. But maybe in quoll time my big human heart is languid, lazy. I was living alone in a caravan in the Northern Territory Wildlife Park at the time, researching my novel about communication between humans and animals, which begins, a little too presciently, with a new flu pandemic sweeping the country. Ginger Meggs was living alone in an enclosure. We paused there together, sharing my heartbeat. But now, in the age of coronavirus, we all live alone. Or with a couple of people, max: our bubble buddies that we are happy to share germs with and no one else. While we keep apart to protect each other, there are still many moments of connection online. We can watch author Miranda July dance in her loungeroom. We can learn how to do the #BlackfellaHug on NITV, celebrate Jacinda Ardern or deplore Scott Morrison together on Facebook. But on the last day of on-site work, I can\u2019t hug my crying colleagues. I recently moved from Melbourne to regional New Zealand and can\u2019t get to my family across the deep Tasman Sea. And I can\u2019t cope with the thousands who have already died from coronavirus. In my riverside town, people tended to holler \u201chello\u201d of a morning. This week, they\u2019ve been inadvertently reduced to a whisper, as though even a greeting might imply inappropriate social contact. Our bodies move awkwardly in public \u2013 we don\u2019t know how to communicate togetherness and solidarity while being so physically separate. But then a woman appears on the river bend, easy limbed, with a dog keeping pace. She doesn\u2019t break her stride when she sees me, she smiles; she\u2019s not alone because she\u2019s with a dog. And that dog wags, showing us how to be in the world. \u201cYou know who this is all working out very nicely for?\u201d author Ella Holcomb posted online, \u201cPETS! VERY nicely indeed.\u201d Another Twitter user had to take their dog, Rolo, to the vet because he sprained his tail from excessive wagging at his suddenly homebound humans. (Rolo now has an Instagram account.) Meanwhile my cousin jokes that, \u201cWhile the rest of NZ was panic buying toilet paper and tins of tomatoes, we panic bought a dog!\u201d Dr Liz Walker, CEO of RSPCA Victoria, tells me over a stuttering Zoom connection that, \u201cPeople with pets have higher self-esteem, are less likely to be depressed, and cope with grief and stress more effectively than non-pet owners. Especially now amid Covid-19, animals give us a sense of connectedness. No matter how bad it gets, animals make you feel safe, they make you feel happy and they\u2019re always glad to see you.\u201d As countries close down and our home lives get smaller, I too \u201cjoke\u201d with my partner that now is the exact right time to rescue a rabbit. I imagine long days of watching Cottontail chewing the furniture and pooing on the rug. And indeed, pets are generally good. For us. But \u2013 and if I didn\u2019t think so much about this I\u2019d have a Cottontail with me right now \u2013 what about the animals? How do they fare in this new world paradigm? Dr Siobhan O\u2019Sullivan, an animal welfare expert from UNSW, says that in times of crises, \u201cwe\u2019re looking out for the humans, but animals are considered dispensable for some. There\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019re still vulnerable when you\u2019re a nonhuman animal, even as a companion animal\u201d. Some people, for instance, have asked vets to put pets to death because they\u2019re concerned that they might carry the virus. New research that cat-to-cat transmission is possible not only increases fear, but makes a pet\u2019s position as beloved family member increasingly tenuous. When it comes down to it, will we continue to protect our companions? Walker agrees that while it\u2019s natural to seek support from your companion animal, \u201cit\u2019s also important to prioritise downtime for everyone, including animals, so that when this ends \u2013 and it will \u2013 animals can cope with the changes in the household. Cats sleep for 18 hours and if you\u2019re home when you were once out, you\u2019re disturbing their sleep patterns. I would get cranky too!\u201d If we\u2019re to eradicate coronavirus globally, isolation will drag into months; for some of us, the birds that we see hanging around outside the window could become our only non-screen living contact for the day. Maybe having more time to watch animals and observe that they have their own lives and needs, will give us a new appreciation for them. \u201cThat feeling of connectedness that you get from animals, and watching them do their thing ... it\u2019s extremely comforting. A lot of people get a whole lot of joy out of watching animals experience happiness and freedom,\u201d Walker says. Can we stop, look around ourselves, realise that we aren\u2019t the centre of the universe, and try to be a different way in the world? Our Zoom chat is broken by a terrifying screech as the New Zealand government sends an emergency alert to every mobile phone in the country, marking the beginning of phase four: total isolation: \u201cFollow the rules and STAY HOME. Act as if you have Covid-19. This will save lives\u201d. For the next four weeks, I\u2019m allowed to see people on the screen and my partner in person \u2013 no one else. But I know that when I go for my sanctioned solitary river walk, I will still see life. Everywhere. Like a scene from the novel I just published, where a strange new flu enables us to understand other animals, my senses will be heightened to them. In the skies, crawling between rocks, hopping in the long grass and waddling at the end of a lead. From their perspective, my presence might mean very little \u2013 they have their own thing going on \u2013 but my heartbeat will slow, calm for a moment. It will mean the world. \u2022 The Animals in that Country by Laura Jean McKay is out now through Scribe in paperback or as eBook"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
