While it was active it housed some of Victoria\u2019s most notorious prisoners, including Ronald Ryan, the last man to be executed in Australia, and Chopper Read, who famously had his ears sliced off in an attempt to escape and described the jail as \"a blood-soaked mental hospital of violence and more violence\". Now the Shayher Group, a property developer, wants to demolish H Division to build an access road for planned new high-rise apartment blocks. The new development will block the last uninterrupted view of the old Pentridge jail, already surrounded by apartment blocks on its southern and eastern sides. Due to a loophole in the Heritage Act which says a developer's application cannot be denied if it \"causes undue financial hardship to the owner\", the developer may well have their way. It might be said that Pentridge, for all its associations with criminals and criminality, is best forgotten. As Justin Madden, the then Victorian planning minister, said when the prison's other notorious wing, Jika Jika, was demolished in an earlier stage of development, \u201cI think most of the Victorian community would be happy to see [Jika Jika] go and I think that\u2019ll be a significant moment in Victoria\u2019s history\u201d. H Division's walls have stories to tell. Not just the stories of notorious criminals that feature so much in the public imagination but also \u2013 perhaps more importantly \u2013 stories of suffering, pain, resilience, compassion, courage and redemption: The story of the original backbreaking labour of the first generation of prisoners who quarried the bluestone from nearby Merri Creek, and made the very bluestone walls possible, and the extraordinary skills of the stonemasons who actually built the walls. The loneliness and despair that afflicted so many generations of prisoners, some imprisoned for actions no longer seen as crimes. One young man who I interviewed for a pre-parole had been given a four year sentence for nothing more than a homosexual liaison. The stories of the family members who visited their loved ones in gaol and on whom prisoners depended so much to keep their sanity. And the compassion of prison chaplains such as Father John Brosnan and Father Peter Nordan, and volunteer prison visitors, like the Quaker Albert Walker, who reached out to even the worst offenders, affirming that there is something of God in everyone. We should also remember well the opponents of capital punishment, who gathered outside Pentridge to protest the hangings of Ronald Ryan and Robert Tait in the 1960s. They were ultimately successful in ending the barbarity of state sanctioned murder, last inflicted on Ryan in 1967 by Victorian premier Henry Bolte, who was deaf to the pleas from writers who implored him to remember the words from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice: The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: There were others who needed mercy: the ones who went to gaol for acts of civil disobedience against injustice, war, and discrimination, like Tramways unionist Clarrie O\u2019Shea in 1969, whose action triggered a national strike of over 1m workers. Later, Frank Penhalluriack, a hardware shop owner, whose action in the 1980s paved the way for the Victorian Sunday trading we enjoy now. Then there were the all-too-numerous Indigenous prisoners, such as the artist Les Griggs, taken away from his family at two as one of the \u201cstolen children\u201d generation, then imprisoned for 21 years in children\u2019s homes and Pentridge, before being released in 1983 at the age of 28. So many stories of individuals destroyed by the violence, rape and brutality of the prison system, yet also the stories of others who, against all the odds, found forms of redemption \u2013 sometimes through writing, arts or education. Pentridge\u2019s past has much to teach us. As the prison's chaplain, Father John Brosnan, recalled before his death: \u201cMelbourne has lost one its best-known institutions; whether it was known for good or bad, it was definitely known \u2026 Some of the finest people I\u2019ve met were out there. It was either a prison uniform or a prison officer uniform, but some of them were remarkable people.\" The original sale of the prison was meant to be accompanied by \u201ca museum \u2026 that will also be built on the site\u201d, according to the then-planning minister, Justin Madden. At the time the promise was a good way to mollify heritage organisations. Needless to say, museums areless profitable than selling off prison cells and land for apartments, and the idea has been forgotten. But, as RMIT\u2019s planning specialist, Professor Michael Buxton, has argued: \u201cJust because it\u2019s in the way of someone making a lot of money is no reason to demolish [H Division]. It should definitely be retained. It has such historic connection to the state as a place of incarceration.\u201d So let Victoria\u2019s state government keep its promise to create a museum, and let the walls and structures that are left, including H Division, form that museum. In the same way that Tasmania has preserved Port Arthur and made it a leading tourist destination and economic asset for the whole state, Heritage Victoria and the state government should do the same for Pentridge, perhaps linking it up with the adjoining Coburg lake park, which was once part of the original Pentridge site. This would make far better sense from both a heritage and an economic viewpoint than allowing the demolition of historic H Division and the destruction of the raft of memories and meanings that will be buried in its rubble. Our wish to forget unpleasant parts of our history \u2013 perhaps at the risk of repeating them \u2013 leaves us afflicted with amnesia, oblivious to the past, heedless of the future. Sometimes history can only be retained if it is embodied in places, photographs, and the etchings and messages of desperate prisoners over some 140 years. Much has already been painted and smoothed over but the whole history of the place could be lost if the developer and council have their way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
