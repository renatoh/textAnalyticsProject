And on occasions that scepticism has not been without reason \u2013 but as the calendar ticks over into September Wigan are beginning to peak at just the right time once again. And what a night they chose to prove it, as the Ben Barba fanfare in St Helens was silenced by their fiercest rivals. Much was made \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 of Barba\u2019s long-awaited debut in Super League, three months after he ended his ill-fated stint with Toulon. But this was indisputably Wigan\u2019s night; suddenly, their Grand Final destiny is back in their own hands. Yes, they remain outside the top four. Yes, they remain a point behind the surprise package who will not roll over and die in Wakefield \u2013 but crucially, they are also now two points shy of third-placed Hull FC. Their opponents next week, with just three games remaining? The side who beat them in last weekend\u2019s Challenge Cup final, Hull. And on a night when all eyes were on the Australian superstar Barba, how fitting that it was Wigan\u2019s own talisman who laid the platform for victory. Sean O\u2019Loughlin is often the Warriors\u2019 linchpin but here, with a first stint almost an hour long before subsequently returning to calm any Wigan nerves, he was magnificent. O\u2019Loughlin was one of several Wigan players suffering with illness before this game. \u201cHe\u2019s tough, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Wane said of his captain. \u201cIt was a really important win, this. We have to roll into Hull next week now and put a few things right from Wembley.\u201d This was perhaps not a fatal blow to St Helens\u2019 chances of making the top four \u2013 but three points adrift with three games remaining, their coach, Justin Holbrook, was insistent about what must happen now. \u201c100 per cent,\u201d he said when asked if they needed to nowwin all their remaining games. St Helens were perhaps left to reflect on a poor start as what ultimately split the two sides. Wigan quickly raced into a 14-0 lead with two tries from Oliver Gildart and from there it always felt that they were holding St Helens at arm\u2019s length. Barba marked his debut with a contentious try to make it 14-4 at half-time, but scores from Anthony Gelling and George Williams after half-time left St Helens with too much to do. They did threaten a comeback when Zeb Taia and Tommy Makinson scored late on but Wigan responded by throwing O\u2019Loughlin back on to steady the ship and it worked. As is perhaps traditional at this time of year, Wigan are flexing their muscles when it matters yet again.
