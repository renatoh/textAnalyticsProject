To preview Monday\u2019s tie against Mexico they presented the assistant manager, Silvinho, and the fitness coach, F\u00e1bio Mahseredjian, alongside Tite and his captain Thiago Silva. Mixed in with the noise and clamour of the world\u2019s most insistent media entourage it almost seemed smothering: so many faces, so many voices, a truckload of competing demands and the sense of something far bigger than everyone else present. Brazil have not consistently inspired that sense of inferiority in the modern era but there is a feeling among players and management that things are falling into place. It certainly did not hurt their cause that, two hours after their brain trust had finished holding court, Spain were the latest of their rivals to fall flat and by then the message had already been put out that the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o do not expect much letup from here. \u201cI think our evolution has been impressive since the first match,\u201d Thiago said. \u201cWe are well-prepared and planning to progress to the quarter-finals. The coach provided us with all the necessary tools; we have plan A and plan B. We hope that [Monday] will be a wonderful day, and that Neymar will be as inspired as everyone else.\u201d The latter has, so far, certainly not been a given. In the win over Serbia, comfortably Brazil\u2019s best performance of the group stage, Neymar operated so obediently that it almost seemed appropriate to reach out and ask whether he was sickening for something. \u201cHis average performance exceeds his teammates\u2019 performances \u2026 but this figure is still not high enough for Neymar,\u201d Tite said, pointing out that he needed to play more games before his recovery from a metatarsal fracture was complete. Brazil have got by in the meantime, Philippe Coutinho becoming the tournament\u2019s most beguiling No 10 and Paulinho among others to step up, and if Tite is given to repetition he would be happy for his team to exhibit a similar trait. \u201cThere will be tweaks but overall an expectation that our team continues to play as in the last match,\u201d he said of the approach against Mexico, who should be beaten if Brazil can raise things a notch above that but have already, in defeating Germany, shown how to punish underperformers. The only notable absentee will be Marcelo, who departed early against Serbia with a back spasm and will not be risked. Mahseredjian and Tite described, between them, the process for ruling on the left-back\u2019s fitness in minute detail but the gist was that the coach did not feel he could play a full game, particularly in heat that is likely to exceed 34C. The expectation had, after the first set of fixtures in a competition that has given short shrift to confident predictions, been that Germany would provide Brazil\u2019s opposition in Samara. \u201cGermany belongs to the past, you cannot revert to the history,\u201d Thiago said in response to that observation; at least the shadow of Belo Horizonte will not be looming now and Brazil can concentrate upon more gettable foes. Mexico intend to give them a game and their manager, Juan Carlos Osorio, said he will not break from his model of fielding five attacking players. \u201cWe will try to keep possession of the ball and I believe we can be better at it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur intention is not to stay behind the ball all the time. We don\u2019t want to stay very deep; they are very good in the last third and always score.\u201d When it clicks for Mexico they crackle, fizz and thrill; no rival has yet produced a counterattacking performance to emulate that of Hirving Lozano, Carlos Vela, Miguel Lay\u00fan and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez against Germany. They are rarely clinical enough though and, as Sweden showed to devastating effect two games later, have a major wobble in them when pressed physically. If Brazil are pleased to be without psychological baggage then Mexico are dogged by constant reminders of six consecutive last-16 exits; their Olympic side did beat Monday\u2019s opponents in the London 2012 final but at senior level they have not scored against them in three meetings since. \u201cFootball always gives you an opportunity to win,\u201d Osorio said, pointing out that the mould for underdog stories has been well cast in Russia. If Mexico can block out the noise they may run Brazil close; for Tite\u2019s pack of wolves, though, negotiating their way through the pandemonium their presence brings to a major tournament should be second nature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
