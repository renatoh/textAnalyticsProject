Rand\u2019s longtime neighbor, Rene Boucher, admitted in a federal court in Kentucky to assaulting a member of Congress resulting in personal injury. The episode had been \u201cprofoundly embarrassing\u201d for Boucher, his lawyer, Matt Baker, said. A judge set sentencing for 15 June. Federal prosecutors plan to seek a 21-month prison sentence, while the defense will argue for probation. The charge carries up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Paul was attacked on 3 November 2017, while mowing his lawn at his home in Kentucky. A friend of Paul\u2019s said the senator had alighted from his ride-on lawnmower to remove a tree branch when he was suddenly tackled from behind. He suffered six broken ribs. Boucher initially pleaded not guilty and Baker was keen for his client to avoid a federal charge. At the time, he said: \u201cIt has nothing to do with politics \u2026 it has to do with a disagreement between two neighbors.\u201d A staffer with Paul\u2019s office disputed media reports that Paul or his wife Kelley had any \u201clongstanding dispute\u201d with their neighbor. \u201cThe Pauls have had no conversations with him in many years,\u201d senior adviser Doug Stafford said last year. \u201cThe first \u2018conversation\u2019 with the attacker came after Senator Paul\u2019s ribs were broken. This was not a fight, it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person.\u201d Boucher agreed to a plea deal in January. Before Friday\u2019s hearing, he had spoken to the authorities of annoyance over Paul\u2019s landscaping and a large pile of brush on his neighbor\u2019s property, and had admitted to law enforcement officers that he ran on to Paul\u2019s property and tackled the politician while he was not looking. Baker will ask the court for mercy and leniency for his client at the time of sentencing, it was reported on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
