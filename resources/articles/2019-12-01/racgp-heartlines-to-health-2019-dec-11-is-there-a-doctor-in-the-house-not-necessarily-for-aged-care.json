Not necessarily for aged care", "bodyText": "When Isabela\u2019s mother moved into an aged care home, it was because she needed more support than it was possible to provide in her own home. She had some complex medical needs, and no one knew that better than her GP. But moving into residential care meant the end of that relationship. \u201cThey said, \u2018This is her doctor now\u2019,\u201d Isabela says. \u201cBut it\u2019s just one doctor, once a week, and just for a couple of hours in the morning. \u201cYou have a really good GP that knows all about you, and then you don\u2019t see them any more.\u201d Difficult decisions GPs provided more than 5.5m Medicare services in residential aged care facilities in 2018-19, according to the Health of the Nation report from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). Much of the work goes unpaid, the RACGP says. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t see is the time out of practice,\u201d RACGP president Dr Harry Nespolon recently told the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. \u201cA lot of these consultations are done out of hours because it\u2019s the only way it makes any economic sense - if you leave your practice during the day you\u2019re not seeing patients that you would normally see.\u201d Dr Morton Rawlin does exactly that, responding to calls from nursing home staff, attending to acute injuries, and visiting patients regularly - out of hours. He is conducting a review into the medical care of aged care residents and is chair of the RACGP Silver Book committee, tasked with updating the college\u2019s clinical guide for aged care. Medicare covers items such as chronic disease management but not things such as the extra time it takes to address complex multiple conditions outside the practice, Dr Rawlin says. Dealing with administrative or service coordination issues and communicating with nursing staff are also outside Medicare.

On top of that, GPs sometimes travel long distances to keep in contact with patients who have had to move to facilities many kilometres away. \u201cThe GP has to make a decision [whether to keep seeing a patient],\u201d Dr Rawlin says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just not possible.\u201d Dr Nespolon told the royal commission that GPs can feel they have \u201cabandoned\u201d their patients. \u201cYou generally feel that \u2026 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about that relationship which may have been going on for many decades and now is lost because of the economics of the situation.\u201d A little bit broken Currently, one in three GP consultations is with someone aged 65 or over, and that number is expected to more than double. This age group will make up 22% of the population by 2057, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare says. Research shows that GPs are both vital in providing the necessary healthcare, and the most cost-effective option. Ideally, people would live independently as long as possible with the appropriate level of in-home support, only moving into residential care if their needs become unmanageable. Dr Rawlin says: \u201cThe aged care royal commission would suggest [that system] is a little bit broken at the moment. \u201cWe haven\u2019t kept pace with the demand for services, particularly in the home, and as such a lot of people have moved into the aged care residential sector, where things have, to some degree, been driven by costs, and sometimes the care has not worked as well as it should.\u201d What\u2019s the way forward? \u201cAged care and multi-morbidity is an area which requires good and well-educated GPs to be involved; it\u2019s very challenging work,\u201d Dr Rawlin says. \u201cThe biggest challenges are the fact that the sector is growing significantly and quickly [and] making sure that we have consistent standards, with well-trained staff, in adequate numbers, so that the care needs for our patients are well served.\u201d That\u2019s the aim, regardless of the model of care. \u201cNot every GP is the same, not every nursing home is the same - there is no one-size-fits-all,\u201d Dr Rawlin says. Dr Rawlin believes the latest edition of the Silver Book can be a useful resource for anyone working towards that goal in the aged care sector. The college is also developing clinical standards to improve the way GPs and aged care facilities work together, streamlining some of the processes that have sometimes created barriers against the provision of care to residents. \u201cIt will make it a little bit easier to know that they\u2019re doing the right thing, to try and demystify things a little bit, and make sure that people get consistency in the quality of their care,\u201d Dr Rawlin says.
