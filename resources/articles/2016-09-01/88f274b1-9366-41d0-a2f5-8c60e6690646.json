Her first book of poetry \u2013 a provocative, raunchy bestseller \u2013 was published in July by Victoria University Press and a reprint has already been ordered. The self-titled book has catapulted the 28-year-old from a respected but anonymous graduate writer to semi-cult status, and she is well aware that her life and work are now inextricably bound together. She\u2019s also pretty OK with that. Poems such as Keats Is Dead So Fuck Me From Behind, Monica (about Monica from friends) and Hate have exploded on to the New Zealand literary scene. Her Twitter followers have ballooned to thousands (including the singer Lorde) and she\u2019s had \u201cminor British celebrities\u201d befriend her on Facebook. The New Zealand Listener magazine called her debut an \u201cunabashedly flamboyant collection\u201d and Sunday magazine said it was \u201cfearless\u201d. Despite the explicit, autobiographical nature of her work, in person \u2013 over drinks at the Dunedin young writer\u2019s festival \u2013 she has an easy, understated presence, even at times a little remote, which is interesting considering she has been frequently charged with over-sharing. The risque, confessional nature of her poetry is hard to detect in the young woman clothed in a patterned dress and leather jacket, slowly sipping a flat white and looking forward to a quiet night in her hotel room watching TV. \u201cGood poetry for me is hard to describe,\u201d she wrote a few weeks earlier in an email, her preferred interview medium, \u201cbut I like poetry that feels alive, or has an energy to it, even after you\u2019ve read it aloud 50 times, even if it sounds a little wrong somehow. \u201cMany people want poetry to be a streamlined vehicle for meaning, but I\u2019m more interested in poetry that allows room for ugliness and error \u2013 I prefer that on an aesthetic level.\u201d Bird wrote the bulk of her book while living in New Zealand\u2019s oldest gothic city, Dunedin \u2013 an experience she calls \u201cstrange\u201d and her time there \u201cgreat lost years\u201d. \u201cI felt like I didn\u2019t do very much in Dunedin. I just made and abandoned quilts, watched a lot of Judge Judy, had some fights, cut all my hair off, grew it back again, drove around small towns in the middle of winter and didn\u2019t do very much writing. But I think wasted time and not working is necessary sometimes too.\u201d Bird still works full time at Unity Books in Wellington \u2013 she likes the job, but she also needs the money \u2013 and is, like the Booker prize winner Eleanor Catton, a graduate of Victoria University\u2019s creative writing program. The best thing about the course was the \u201cpaid time\u201d it gave her to write, and the close relationships she formed with some of her classmates, both as friends and mentors. They still go out for karaoke sessions. It was also during this year that Bird was introduced to her big, American influences \u2013 Dorothea Lasky, Chelsey Minnis and Mark Laidler \u2013 and came to realise that poetry didn\u2019t have to be stuffy and archaic. You didn\u2019t have to engage in endless close readings of Coleridge to be a poet. \u201cI\u2019m at my worst when I\u2019m serious, in writing and in life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt drains all the blood out of my work. I tried for years to outrun my own jokes, to write measured and lyric work, to make my poems as pristine and elegant as possible, but they were just dead on the page.\u201d The tone and icepick casualness of Bird\u2019s prose can make it seem offhand but underlying the playfulness is a focused dedication to her craft and a writing process she describes as \u201cintensely rigorous\u201d. \u201cI spent months on some of the longer poems,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to be flippant when it comes to writing, because I am flippant in many things, but I never want to say that I don\u2019t work extremely hard at what I do. The mechanics involved in writing this poetry are slow and painstaking beyond belief, which perhaps explains why I don\u2019t always write regularly or quickly.\u201d When Keats Is Dead So Fuck Me From Behind was published on the Spinoff website in July it received 50,000 page views, making it arguably one of the most popular poems published in New Zealand. But Bird needs more than page views to be convinced she\u2019s made it. \u201cJudging poetry by page views isn\u2019t really a good indicator of whether or not your work is any good,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s proof that the work is successful but it\u2019s proof that people are interested, which is a good start.\u201d \u2022 Hera Lindsay Bird is out now through Victoria University Press \u2022 This article has been amended with a correct page view count for Bird\u2019s poem Keats Is Dead"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
