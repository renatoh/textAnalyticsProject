Fellow passengers have toddler-like tantrums when asked to make way for pushchairs or release a Victor Meldrew-sized tut when a child starts to howl. More than two-thirds of women surveyed in a poll for Transport 2000 and Mother &amp; Baby magazine felt that their crying baby annoyed other passengers, 72% thought that public transport was difficult to use, and 60% found bus drivers unhelpful. The moaners are probably the same people who grumble about the falling birthrate (no one wants dwindling future generations, because who will pay taxes to fund those paltry state pensions?) and are equally miffed that more women remain childless as a lifestyle choice. But is that any surprise? Once you've got over the pregnancy (that's a laugh on the tube - you've got less chance of getting a seat than a Ukip candidate), your single friends disappear faster than a CSA dad. And when you finally descend on your local caff with your newfound NCT chums with enough buggies, pureed carrot and babies to fill the Albert Hall, you're about as welcome as an Asbo working lunch. Women with babies and toddlers are not welcome in the mainstream. We inhabit an underworld like hoodies, except our haunt isn't the bus shelter, it's toy libraries and play groups. Public transport is definitely where small children are enfants terribles. One mother with small children in Southport complains that local buses make no provision for pushchairs, and drivers insist she folds hers (with baby tucked under her arm) before she boards. Another in Lyme Regis says the spaces for pushchairs are always full. Dorset has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country, and those under-18 mums beat her to them every time. But perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel. London - so often berated as the capital of crap transport - seems to be positively generous in comparison. Determined to take my son to see the riches of London by tube, I have only ever been left unaided at the bottom of a staircase once. I've been genuinely surprised by the people who even notice us. Blinged-up teenagers mumble or jerk their heads towards the buggy and grab the base of my trusty Greco before I can ruin their cool with a gushing thanks. Often I see these boys later, lazing along the platform in a 50 Cent stroll, as I try to fit the two images together. Twentysomething women and old Muslim men clothed in traditional white rush to help. And once three women, dressed in sparkling wedding-guest saris, helped me down the stairs at Euston station, even though I couldn't understand their language and they couldn't understand mine. Which brings me to a depressing truth. I have never been offered help from a white middle-class man. Struggling down the stairs at Manor Park station, one sailed passed me. No, actually he hesitated long enough to shoot me a look of disgust. Oh, and I did incur the wrath of a female ticket inspector who looked at me as if I were asking her to trot to the shops and buy me a bottle of Calpol. But even in London, buses are still a nightmare. One friend recently decided to do the ethical thing and leave the gas-guzzler in the drive. She gamely trotted the children to the bus-stop - but arrived at the school gates traumatised, as much by the crush of travelling as by the rudeness, jostling and selfishness of fellow passengers. The next day, the car keys were out again. She might be contributing to a scarier future for her children, but she's hoping it will be less traumatic than her day on public transport. cayte.w@virgin.net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
