Twenty years later, he sees a broader backward trend: the west's clash with Islamist jihad replays the Crusades, and war in Afghanistan circles back to Britain and Russia's 19th-century Great Game. In Berlusconi's Italy, where power is exercised through near-monopoly control of the mass media, the novelist and professor of semiotics sees parallels with the fascist rule of his own boyhood. The war on terror and Berlusconi dominate Turning Back the Clock, a collection of columns and lectures in which Eco moves away from the cultural preoccupations of earlier compilations. In analysing current affairs he's invariably sane, astute and capable of making suggestive historical connections; but something has been lost in his transformation from a don rampaging around in popular culture to a sensible political pundit. When you read Eco, you want to be dazzled and provoked, not merely to nod in agreement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
