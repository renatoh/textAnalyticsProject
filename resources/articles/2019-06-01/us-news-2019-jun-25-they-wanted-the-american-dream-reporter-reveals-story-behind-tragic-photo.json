Her shocking photographs showing the bodies of Salvadoran migrant \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and his daughter Valeria cast a fresh spotlight on the migration crisis at America\u2019s southern border. Here she describes how the images came into being. On Sunday there was an emergency call about a woman who was in a desperate way down by the river. We heard the report and went down to the river where she was shouting and screaming that the current had taken her daughter. Later we found out her name was Vanessa \u00c1valos. We could hear her telling the officials that they had been in Mexico for two months and wanted to ask for asylum in the US. She said they they\u2019d been in Tapachula in the south of Mexico and they\u2019d applied for a humanitarian visa [allowing them to stay and work in Mexico for a year] but they wanted the American dream \u2013 so they took a bus up to the border. They\u2019d arrived here earlier that morning and they went straight to the [international] bridge to ask about applying for asylum, but they were told the American migration office was closed because it was a weekend \u2013 and that there lots of other people in the line ahead of them. A few months ago there were about 1,800 people waiting in Matamoros for an asylum interview. It\u2019s gone down to about 300 now, but there are only three interview slots each week, so they were still looking at a long wait. So the family were walking back from the bridge when [Mart\u00ednez] stopped and looked at the river \u2013 and said \u201cHere\u2019s where we cross\u201d. He crossed first with the little girl and he left her on the American side. Then he turned back to get his wife, but the girl went into the water after him. When he went to save her, the current took them both. Someone called the rescue services \u2013 on this bank there are always people jogging and riding bikes on the weekend \u2013 and the search went on until after 11pm, but even with boats and lamps they couldn\u2019t find them. The next morning, they continued in the light of day and, at about 10.15 in the morning, the firemen found the two bodies. That\u2019s when I took the pictures, before the scene was taped off. I\u2019ve been a crime reporter for many years, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of bodies \u2013 and a lot of drownings. The R\u00edo Bravo [Rio Grande] is a very strong river: you think it\u2019s just shallow, but there are lots of currents and whirlpools. You get numb to it, but when you see something like this it re-sensitizes you. You could see that the father had put her inside his T-shirt so the current wouldn\u2019t pull her away. He died trying to save his daughter\u2019s life. Will it change anything? It should. These families have nothing, and they are risking everything for a better life. If scenes like this don\u2019t make us think again \u2013 if they don\u2019t move our decision-makers \u2013 then our society is in a bad way. In Mexico there has been a lot of talk about the crisis on our southern border [where President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has dispatched more than 6,000 members of Mexico\u2019s national guard to seal off the frontier with Guatemala]. But there is a crisis on our northern border, too \u2013 the border with the United States \u2013 and I see it every day. These are desperate families \u2013 and desperate people do desperate things.
