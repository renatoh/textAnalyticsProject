Robinson, 51, hopes to be well enough to be back at work full-time to cover the general election campaign in the runup to voting on 7 May. The veteran broadcaster needs an operation to remove a bronchial carcinoid tumour from his lung, his agent said. In a statement, she said Robinson, who is married with three children, would be \u201ctaking a short time off work\u201d over the next few weeks. \u201cHis doctors are aiming to get him back at work in plenty of time to cover the election campaign proper,\u201d she added. \u201cHe and his family have asked that they now have the space and privacy he needs in order to rest and recover fully before returning to work.\u201d News of his illness sparked an outpouring of get-well messages on Twitter. Prime minister David Cameron tweeted his best wishes. \u201cSorry to hear you\u2019ll be off for a few weeks. I wish you well \u2013 and a speedy return before the \u2026 election.\u201d Labour leader Ed Miliband posted: \u201cBest wishes for a speedy recovery. Look forward to seeing you on the campaign trail soon.\u201d Tim Shipman, political editor of the Sunday Times, said: \u201cEvery hack in the land crossing their fingers for the great @bbcnickrobinson who is having treatment for a tumour on the lung.\u201d Robinson\u2019s colleague, Chris Mason, a BBC political correspondent, said his editor \u201csets the pace in political broadcast\u201d and wished him a speedy recovery. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cEveryone at the BBC wishes Nick a speedy recovery.\u201d Robinson responded to his 350,000 Twitter followers: \u201cThank you for the many kind and generous messages. Here\u2019s hoping to be back reporting the news soon.\u201d Carcinoid tumours, a type of neuroendocrine cancer, are rare and tend to be slow growing, sometimes not causing any symptoms for several years, according to Cancer Research UK. Around a quarter start in the lung and typically do not spread to other parts of the body. They usually occur in men over the age of 60, and the vast majority start in the gut or stomach. Unlike other lung growths, carcinoid tumours are not thought to be linked to cigarettes. It is not thought the journalist is a smoker. In a 2009 interview with the Guardian, Robinson said doctors told him he was \u201cmore healthy than I deserve to be\u201d. Asked about his attitudes to smoking, he added: \u201cI hate it. My parents smoked, [but] they gave up. I was the sort of irritating child who used school art classes to make anti-smoking propaganda.\u201d Last week, it was announced that the broadcaster would be teaming up with the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, and others to take part in a CBBC television programme designed to explain the workings of democracy to young viewers. Six pupils at a London primary school are to be filmed campaigning for the position of headteacher and Robinson is to be one of those on hand to give the candidates advice on policies and strategies. He joined the BBC in 1986 as a trainee producer and has been in his current role leading the corporation\u2019s Westminster coverage since 2005, having left the BBC for ITV for a short period."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
