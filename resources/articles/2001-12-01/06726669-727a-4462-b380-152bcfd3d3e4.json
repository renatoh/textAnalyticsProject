A month later the 28-year-old will compete in the Australian trials at Brisbane, seeking selection for her third Commonwealth Games, in Manchester next summer. \"I'm training really well, I'm not ill, and my level of enthusiasm is as high as ever,\" Freeman said yesterday. While athletes are continually sidelined through injury, it is rare for a world-class performer to choose to take a sabbatical from the sport. The urge to capitalise financially as well as accumulate titles are powerful incentives for most athletes to keep competing. Freeman, though, has never fitted any conventional mould. The Sydney Olympics gave her a domestic and international profile arguably higher than any Australian in history. The opening ceremony, in which she lit the Olympic flame, and her 400m victory became the two highest-rated Australian television programmes in history. In the moment of her 400m victory, Freeman's reaction was almost catatonic. As if, in that moment, the full weight of expectation hit home. So after the Sydney Games she put her career on hold. Much of the time away has been spent in the US, including doing charity work in Portland, Oregon, where her husband Sandy Boedecker, a Nike executive, is based. Freeman resumed training six weeks ago, the 13 months away having extracted an all-too apparent toll with her weight increasing by 10kg. According to her coach Peter Fortune, she has already lost a significant amount of that excess. \"She's made a lot of strides since she started. I think we're probably about halfway there now as far as the weight and everything goes,\" he said. Freeman's first Commonwealth outing was in Auckland 11 years ago when as a 16-year-old she won a gold medal in the 100m relay team. In Vancouver four years later she became the first athlete to win both the 200m and 400m at a Commonwealth Games, but then missed Kuala Lumpur in 1998. If Freeman can find the motivation to return to even near her best, the encounter in Manchester with Jamaica's Lorraine Fenton and England's Katharine Merry, the other two Sydney medallists, promises to be one of the highlights of the Games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
