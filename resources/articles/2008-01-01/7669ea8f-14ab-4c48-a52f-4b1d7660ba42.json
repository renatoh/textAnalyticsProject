This time the prime minister was giving one of his frequent press conferences in Downing Street. He was trying to gee us up for the year ahead and was accompanied, for no apparent reason, by Alistair Darling, the chancellor. For much of the time Darling stood still, eyes motionless, gazing towards us with all the animation of Nelson on his column. It was if someone had forgotten to put his batteries in, or in these security conscious days, had omitted to phone in the operational codes. It would be unfair to say that he resembled a ventriloquist's doll but I noticed that when he was speaking, the prime minister adopted a rictus smile, as if he was trying to keep his mouth open while throwing his voice. It would have been a giveaway if, just as bad vents say \"gottle of geer\", he had praised our \"economic stagility, replacing goom and gust\". Gordon Brown, who is really his own chancellor, spoke at length. He was \"vigilant but positive\" about the British economy. When Darling was allowed to give utterance, he was less blase. There was \"considerable uncertainty\" in the global economy, and it would be a difficult year ahead. But there was good news, of a sort: \"We are almost better placed than most other countries,\" he said. This was not, perhaps, the most ringing endorsement imaginable. Darling resumed his silence. His boss spoke in thunderous intangibles. He was interested in long-term strategy, not short-term fixes. Even when Brown is asked a specific question he takes refuge in vagueness. Take knife crime. This would be fought by screening, targeting, monitoring \"hotspots\", and \"tightening up on police resources\", whatever that means. Someone asked him if he was suffering from \"the Hillary Clinton factor\": being newly unloved by the public and hurt as a result. And, the reporter asked, had he had a makeover? \"No!\" Brown barked. \"I am focused not on the short term but on the long term ... these are the issues I will focus on and continue to focus on.\" If you asked what his wife gave him for Christmas he could never say \"a nice pullover\" but would bang on about \"my vision to meet the rising expectations of the British people\". There was one genuine chuckle, when someone asked him if he planned \"to follow the initiative of President Sarkozy on Syria\". \"It certainly wasn't to do with Syria,\" he said, and grinned wolfishly, perhaps at the thought of a European leader worse off than himself. By the end he was on to carbon trading. \"London could become the centre for the global carbon market,\" he mused. My mind wandered. I liked the idea of the old London carbon market, possibly located in a forgotten corner of the East End. Here once were sly, bearded Dutch youths rattling boxes of uncut diamonds. At the cheap end housewives would buy lumps of charcoal to make a simple soup, and black-faced sweeps would creep in with bags of stolen soot. \"There you go, sir, half-a-crown a sack and I'm cheating myself.\" But of course what he really meant was a bunch of slick city boys sitting in offices and making fortunes trading bent carbon emission permits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
