The grey cashmere Armani overcoat was a fixture for the first two years at the Bridge and, along with a schoolboy's low-slung tie, was enough to earn him the runner's-up spot as GQ's best-dressed man two years in succession. He auctioned the coat for charity in 2006, raising \u00a322,000, and replaced it with a black Ermenegildo Zegna shorty raincoat or the uniform of those who want to show their indispensability to the team, the club tracksuit. Alas, it seems, his Premier League mojo was hawked with Giorgio's billy goat. The hair \"Grey hair is a crown of glory,\" it says in Proverbs, \"if it is found in the way of righteousness.\" It doesn't say if self-righteousness counts but can it be a coincidence that those adverts for Just For Men seem to have disappeared from our screens? Mourinho did more for the badger look than any man since Dickie Davies hung up his World of Sport blazer. His style in two title-winning seasons went from Clooney to Rooney and back again but last season the hair became matted with what teds used to call \"jollop\" and the stubble was more Albert Steptoe than Faith-era George Michael. This month he unveiled a curious back-combed bouffant which was either a homage to Amy Winehouse in her hour of trouble or evidence that the Villa Park dressing room has no mirrors. The pet Footballers generally prefer muscle-bound dogs with scary teeth or the labradors of Keane or Clough but Jose's best friend - symbolism alert- was a lap dog. When police visited Casa Mourinho to investigate claims that Leya the Yorkshire terrier had avoided quarantine her master hot-footed it from Chelsea's player of the year awards and was arrested and cautioned for obstruction when he refused to hand over the dog. Leya found sanctuary in Portugal, a fate which may await her owner. Gurning Fortunately the wind never changed when Mourinho was running through his repertoire of facial expressions, or he might have been left looking like Les Dawson's gossiping widow, Cissy. He conveyed his emotions by puffing out his cheeks, mooning his eyes and doing that Gordon Brown jaw thing, emphasising, like Oliver Hardy before talkies, that you don't have to speak to communicate. Celebrations After winning the Premiership in 2006, Mourinho ran to the Matthew Harding Stand at Stamford Bridge and threw his medal and blazer into the crowd. \"I have one from the last season, it's the same medal,\" he said. \"I want only one. I cannot keep everything I have.\" Perhaps that's why the Champions League was not as much of a priority for him as for Roman Abramovich. After all, Mourinho has won it once and hasn't the space for a second medal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
