A loud rhythmic tweeting is emanating from the cherry plum tree in my back garden. A great tit? Blue tit? I catch a glimpse; too small for a great tit, not as colourful. I don\u2019t know my birdsongs beyond the basics, but I remember a friend imitating calls to coax birds nearer so he could identify them. I have an idea and grab my phone and Google \u201ccoal tit song\u201d. I press play and the rival tweeting produces instant results. Hopping from branch to branch towards me a delightful but agitated coal tit emerges and alights on a branch barely two metres away (I think it knows). Is it angry or amorous? My exhilaration at our proximity turns to doubt and guilt \u2013 I\u2019ve used gadgetry to disrupt the natural world. What was I thinking? The coal tit flies off, its song tinged with irritation. Clearly, playing birdsong on phones can produce results but could this be unethical? I decide to ask Chris Packham through the Facebook page he\u2019s set up, the Self-Isolating Bird Club , which is crewed by thousands of nature enthusiasts. There can be few better online platforms than this in showing how modern, accessible tech has revolutionised local wildlife reporting. People have put mini cameras in nest boxes, on feeders; installed trail cameras on patios; and remote-triggered DSLRs have been placed in tree canopies. This stuff is no longer the preserve of well resourced global-roaming wildlife film production teams. Packham says of the daily morning live feed, the focal point of the group, which has attracted more than 500,000 viewers daily: \u201cWe\u2019re doing it all on mobile phones and Skype with earpods, and I\u2019ve got a digital microscope. Fabian Harrison, a former RSPB guy, is mixing it in his bedroom in Norwich. It\u2019s Dad\u2019s Army makes TV. It\u2019s very real and in the moment but with no campaigning \u2013 no banging on about shooting or anything. It\u2019s all just joy and enjoying wildlife and getting people to engage. As long as it [lockdown] lasts, we\u2019ll just keep going.\u201d The results are extraordinary, and not just on the live show. Each day, the public posts gems such as barn owls evicting jackdaws that had attempted to squat their nest box; sea eagles being mobbed by red kites; hedgehogs scurrying under garden furniture; and adders emerging into the spring sunshine. Michaela Strachan, Packham\u2019s colleague on the BBC\u2019s Springwatch programme, who has also featured on the Self Isolating show from her home in South Africa, tells me that even she has now changed the way she enjoys wildlife: \u201cA whole new wave of birdwatching is happening. Amazingly, I\u2019ve never taken the time to sit down and watch birds on my feeders.\u201d Strachan says the appeal of placing cameras in the garden comes from a different place to the motivations of expert birdwatchers: \u201cThe birds become like family. Right now our lives have never been so uncertain. You know the birds are coming to feed every day\u2026 we look for those kind of certainties. The mental health benefits are proven. When I took those two hours in my garden, I instantly felt better.\u201d Others go further, suggesting that watching animals is instinctive behaviour. In an essay for Aeon, biologist David Barash writes: \u201cOur well-being \u2013 survival, even \u2013 depended on relationships to other animals, many of which were predators, with us as their prey.\u201d Our ancestors\u2019 awareness of animal behaviour would hold a \u201cpotent selective advantage\u201d. Strachan says it\u2019s important that people remember that webcams will show violent, upsetting scenes and warns that we shouldn\u2019t turn against species for being predators: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with getting emotionally attached but you have to put it in perspective. Don\u2019t demonise animals.\u201d She recommends webcams such as those run by the Dyfi osprey centre (ospreys are a favourite bird of hers), and local wildlife trusts featuring \u201cflagship\u201d birds such as peregrines (Leamington Hall) and barn owls (Dorset), as well as badgers, bats and waterfowl. With several webcams on screen at once you\u2019ll soon be feeling like naturalist security guard. Watching webcams can be monotonous of course, but the action, when it happens, is often spectacular \u2013 ospreys touching down, peregrines returning with their prey, an otter passing a lakeside nest \u2026 and anything you might have missed will be picked up and pored over by the commenters. Osprey webcams are already up and running this year, the majestic birds returning from Africa in recent weeks, others will be online early in April. Among them will be Wild Days on the Earthwatch Europe platform, featuring Strachan as part of a team offering an hour\u2019s worth of daily activities online, to show you what\u2019s going on in your gardens, patios and balconies. Although Packham says his group is about enjoying and engaging with wildlife, webcams also play a role in campaigning for nature. Rewilding Europe invites you to \u201cbecome a citizen scientist and help analyse camera trap photos\u201d. Using the Zoological Society of London\u2019s Instant Wild platform, animals such as wolves and wild boar, pine marten and porcupine have been tracked in Italy since the programme\u2019s start in August last year, with plans to expand into more rewilding areas across the continent. \u201cWith camera trap photos and videos from locations around the world posted online, Instant Wild lets citizen scientists take part in vital global conservation work,\u201d says Kate Moses, a project manager with ZSL\u2019s Conservation Technology Programme. Back with the Self Isolating Bird Club, I\u2019m waiting for my admonishment for using Google to attract a coal tit through recorded birdsong. Meanwhile, naturalist Lucy Hodson is waxing lyrical about woodlice (\u201ccrustaceans not insects\u201d) and millipedes (\u201cabsolutely love \u2018em\u201d). Then I get my answer: it\u2019s OK as long as you don\u2019t keep doing it in the same place with the same species, and don\u2019t do it with rare birds at all. It\u2019s a partial let off, but I get the feeling that for me and many others, our relationship with the natural world is about to become more intimate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
