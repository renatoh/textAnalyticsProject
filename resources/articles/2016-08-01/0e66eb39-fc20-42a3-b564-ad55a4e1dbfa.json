Sitting in front of a tinsel-ringed mirror in Miskaa Salon, her head is bent forward, two women at work braiding twists into her hair. She will be stuck in the chair for at least three hours. It is a good moment to pounce. Fatoumatah Kamara, 20, an apprentice hairdresser in a matching skirt and blouse and glinting cherry earrings, sidles up to Bah. She starts to make conversation. At first, it is the usual hairdresser chatter. What rain we\u2019ve been having, eh? Where are you from? What are you up to this weekend? This is the 20-year-old accountancy student\u2019s second visit to the salon in Guinea\u2019s capital, Conakry. Soon Kamara\u2019s questions become more personal. Does Bah have a husband? A boyfriend? Then she goes in for the kill. Does she know there are ways of avoiding getting pregnant? With every manicure, pedicure and hairdo at the Miskaa Salon, clients receive a free treatment: a great deal of contraceptive advice. Five salons across Conakry have been dispensing family planning advice since 2012, and they have been so successful that the project \u2013 the brainchild of Jhpiego, a health organisation associated with Johns Hopkins University in the US \u2013 is about to be extended to salons in Guinea\u2019s seven major cities. In Guinea, which has one of the lowest rates of modern contraceptive use in the world, women have an average of five children. According to UN figures, in 2015 only 7.5% of married or cohabiting women use some form of contraception. A lot of effort has gone into teaching women in rural Guinea about family planning, but not so much in urban areas. A salon is an excellent place to reach them, so long as it is the right kind of salon. \u201cIt\u2019s better to go where they do braids because that\u2019s what women traditionally want,\u201d says Yolande Hyjazi, Jhpiego\u2019s director in Guinea. \u201cA woman who\u2019s straightening or washing her hair has more money and more access to information.\u201d Across town from Miskaa, Jumelle Coiffure is trying to turn around clients as fast as possible, largely because the room is impossibly cramped. Jumelle is owned by 32-year-old twins Tata Sylla, wearing a short black and bright green wig, and her sister Mbalia, with long, heavy braids. \u201cThere were a lot of young women getting pregnant around here when they didn\u2019t want to, with lots of kids running after them, and I thought it would be good to teach them how to avoid that. Even my apprentices were getting pregnant,\u201d says Mbalia, making up Aminata Kouma\u2019s face just inside the salon door. Outside, a dozen girls huddle under the dripping overhang of the salon\u2019s tin roof, filing fingernails and tugging at each other\u2019s hair. Kouma, 35, says she first heard about family planning at Jumelle. \u201cI never knew about this before coming here \u2013 they taught me how,\u201d she said. \u201cI got the injection, and since then I\u2019ve been able to control the number of children I have. I already have four and I don\u2019t want any more. My husband can\u2019t afford it, school fees are so high. There\u2019s too much suffering here. I\u2019m a housemaid, but I\u2019m out of work.\u201d Each salon has an army of apprentices, some of whom have worked in them for years, to cope with the intensity of the work and the number of clients. Jhpiego deliberately chose very popular salons to reach as many people as possible, and trained some of their apprentices as community health workers, to explain how to use exclusive breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy, talk about implants, sell pills and write referrals. They earn half the sale price for any pills and condoms they sell. The trial started in 2013, but everything had to stop for the Ebola outbreak. Like all health organisations, Jhpiego had to turn its efforts to fighting Ebola. In any case, women were not going to the salon. It is now back in full swing, though, and tailors\u2019 shops are the next target. \u201cThere are women that wait around all day for their dresses, trying them on,\u201d Hyjazi said. \u201cPeople are being social, hanging around. But in the tailors\u2019 shops we also have a lot of young men. Reaching men is important.\u201d The idea is that clients of both establishments will talk to their friends, and word will spread. At Miskaa, a large wedding party is getting ready. Apprentice hairdressers cluster around each client, carefully painting on long, black eyebrows, blow-drying hair straight, and making minute adjustments to towering, shiny headwraps. Kamara, pointing at her laminated booklet, has just finished explaining how to use a string of beads to track fertility. But it isn\u2019t new to Bah. \u201cI go on Google, I go on YouTube, I find information,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not everybody is a student like me.\u201d She knew about condoms and pills, but not the other methods Kamara talks about. Young people have far more access to information than previous generations, and sex is slowly becoming something that is more talked about. Traditionally, a Guinean woman would space out her children by leaving her husband and going back to her mother\u2019s house for a few years, every time she had a baby. \u201cNow no one is using abstinence, so everyone is using contraceptives, but no one is talking about it,\u201d Hyjazi says. \u201cMany people think that if a women is using contraceptives, it\u2019s because she has another partner. There\u2019s not a lot of open communication \u2013 even between a husband and wife using them. Many women will use the pill without telling their husbands.\u201d One thing is unlikely to change, though, and according to Hyjazi, it is skewing the statistics, because people doing surveys do not always do them in private. \u201cIf a woman is asked if she\u2019s using contraceptives and her mother or mother-in-law is there, she\u2019ll never say yes.\u201d The wedding party is almost ready. Kamara looks over each woman carefully before opening the door for them. In a few hours, they have become more glamorous and, thanks to Kamara, more contraceptive-savvy. \u201cI like making women beautiful \u2013 that\u2019s why I work here,\u201d says Kamara, already looking around for her next quarry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
