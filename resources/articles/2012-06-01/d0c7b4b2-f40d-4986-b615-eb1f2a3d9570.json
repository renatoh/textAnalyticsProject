Fear of demotion, fear of exposure, fear of humiliation. The bad days are bad, but the bad dreams are worse. If trouble seems likely, best to stay away. And so it was, it would seem, for the climate change minister Greg Barker, who was asked to take part in a Guardian debate about the environment. Ours is a fine record, he said: the greenest government ever. But then something funny happened, and it happened about the time we told the minister that his challenger in debate would be our very own George Monbiot. From then on, minister Barker just didn't seem so keen any more. He said his timetable was clogged \u2013 poor air quality perhaps \u2013 and that having pondered, he thought the matters for discussion didn't quite fall into his area of responsibility. He'll cite the demands and protocols of government. But then there is the fear. A minister who survives needs to be the smartest one in the room. \u2022 But you try getting them into the room. Time-poor defence secretary Phil Hammond had to cancel a lunch engagement at Westminster yesterday because he'd had to scurry off to the funeral of Prince Nayef, crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Right that the government should be represented. As arms sales go, the Saudis are awfully good clients. So, a time of great sadness. But there is some comfort for Prince Charles in all this. The heir to King Abdullah, who is 89, was himself 78 years old. With his passing, the new heir, one of 20 still-living sons of the House of Saud's dynastic founder, is Prince Salman. He is 76. There is no sign of passing the torch to the younger generation, in a country where half the population is under 25. Our own crown prince is a mere 63. In Riyadh terms, a spring chicken. \u2022 What a party. Aung San Suu Kyi was in Oxford yesterday, receiving her degree, but on Monday she was in Dublin. A star-studded event it was, the Electric Burma tribute, with artists from music, drama, cinema and dance performing in the presence of the Nobel peace prize recipient. And, of course, Bob Geldof and Bono. Perfect, but missing a certain something. That something, it would appear, was the self-described \"mother/singer/writer/priest/lover/mentler\" Sinead O'Connor. We cannot know what was said to her. But on her blog, O'Connor claims Amnesty International Ireland asked her to perform, but that it was an invitation with conditions. \"They would like me to come and sing but not to open my mouth about anything or say or do or wear anything controversial. Or act like a crazy person. I found the terms in which the invitation were put to be extremely insulting and disrespectful. I therefore turned down the invitation.\" Odd, she says, that \"an event which is supposed to celebrate women's freedom should be used as an opportunity to prophylactically silence a female artist\". On Twitter, she blamed Geldof and Bono and Amnesty for the insult, and debate rages \u2013 for O'Connor and against. Aung San Suu Kyi herself floats serenely above it all, but then that is her way. \u2022 From the Jewish Chronicle we learn that once again Giles Coren is hovering above the mire. Big Dave and Sam Cam went to the restaurant Oslo Court. Coren wondered why. It's very old-fashioned Jewish, wrote Coren in his Times column: \"In north London, we think of Oslo Court as a hidden treasure. And we tend to think 'Better, like poor Anne Frank, it should have stayed hidden'.\" The restaurant seems ready to move on, but following a third party complaint, the matter now rests with the Press Complaints Commission. In time, it will take a view. \u2022 Finally, our UN-style mediation between the newly honoured Kate Winslet CBE and the Family Haven \u2013 the Gloucester charity that complained it didn't see much of its garlanded patron \u2013 has borne fruit. \"We've now resumed contact and we have a pair of shoes to auction,\" reports Gillian Lunn, the chair of the trustees, whose grumble first moved us to intervene. A satisfied customer. We are a beacon in this cynical world. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
