The Office of Fair Trading called for a radical overhaul of the voluntary banking code, which governs the way banks treat their customers. The competition body called for greater transparency in pricing and for banks to give customers 14 days notice before any fees were levied. The intervention by the OFT follows a series of investigations and public campaigns which have forced the banks to change their practices. It is estimated that banks charged customers, many on low incomes, almost \u00a35bn in fees last year for unauthorised overdrafts. Anti-poverty campaigners have lobbied MPs to curtail the power of the banks to raise charges, which have increased steeply in recent years. Default payments on credit cards have been capped at \u00a312 - from up to \u00a335 previously - while the OFT has referred to the Competition Commission concerns about the sale of payment protection insurance, sold to customers worried about debt payments if they are ill or unemployed. OFT chief executive John Fingleton said he wanted the banks to make current accounts and other products more transparent. He said: \"Significant change is needed to the banking codes of practice, particularly to address the lack of transparency that pervades the retail banking sector. \"We aspire to a self-regulatory framework in UK retail banking that achieves sufficiently high levels of fair treatment of customers that little or no external regulatory intervention is called for.\" He said banks should be compelled to notify customers at least 14 days before all charges and interest are taken from customers' accounts. His comments follow similar criticism from the Financial Ombudsman Service, which warned earlier this month that a tougher code of conduct was needed to prevent mis-selling credit cards and loans, especially to people on low incomes. The ombudsman scheme said guidelines in the Banking Code were weak and failed to give consumers the protection offered by other financial services companies. The banking codes are intended to set good banking practice standards for UK financial institutions and are overseen by British Bankers Association. Most banks subscribe to the code, but it their compliance is voluntary. Which?, formerly the Consumers' Association, said tens of thousands of bank customers were punished by excessive bank charges every year. It said almost 120,000 template letters to help consumers challenge banks on overdraft charges were downloaded from the watchdog's website last year. A spokesman for Which? said: \"Current account providers hit us with \u00a34.7bn of unauthorised overdraft charges in the last year. Although thousands of consumers have been very successful in their challenges, banks have remained, for the most part, resolutely silent on this issue in the hope that it will just go away. \"The sheer number of people preparing to take action against unfair bank charges shows that the banks can't ignore this issue for much longer.\" He welcomed the OFT's demands for changes to the banking code. In response the banking industry has shown signs of frustration. Angela Knight, chief executive designate of the British Bankers' Association, said in an interview with the Guardian: \"Where we have questions are firstly that when regulators look at issues they need to look at the [wider] issue and not take narrow views and secondly that they need to think about consequences\". She used payment protection insurance as an example. \"How many people are now buying this type of protection? \"The economic indicators are now going in the wrong direction. At the very point when people do need protection they may not be taking it out because the message they are getting is that ... maybe there's something wrong with it\". The City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, also issued its response to the review of the banking. It called for an \"over-arching fairness objective\" to make the code fit for purpose until 2011. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
