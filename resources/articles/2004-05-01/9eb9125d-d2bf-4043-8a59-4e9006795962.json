Work hard, keep your head down, and never miss a chance to impress. Kerrin McEvoy, who has ridden more than 500 winners in his native Australia, has been Godolphin's second jockey for just a couple of months, but already he seems to know precisely what is required. McEvoy began a brief spell as Godolphin's first-choice rider - the result of the freak hand injury suffered by Frankie Dettori on Tuesday - with his first ever ride at Goodwood yesterday. This is a track that takes a great deal of knowing, and as McEvoy himself admitted, \"like no other course that I've seen anywhere in the world.\" Yet he showed no trace of nerves or uncertainty as he steered Papineau to victory at 8-1 in the card's opening race, a success that could herald a successful summer for the four-year-old. McEvoy took a typical Goodwood route down the straight, ducking inside and out as he looked for running room. But when he pulled Papineau to the outside a couple of furlongs out, he quickened smartly to beat his stablemate Songlark - McEvoy's original booking in the race - by two and a half lengths. Papineau had not seen a racecourse since finishing fifth to the subsequent Arc winner Dalakhani in the French Derby last June, and suffering a knee injury in the process. Now fully recovered, his major entries include the Coronation Cup and the Gold Cup at Ascot, although the former contest, at Epsom on June 4, is not certain to suit. \"Papineau had a nasty injury so we have been patient and purposely started off low-key, with the intention being to blow the cobwebs away before we got too ambitious,\" Simon Crisford, Godolphin's racing manager, said. \"We were worried that the ground might be too lively today, and while he's won, we might be a bit concerned about the undulations at Epsom.\" McEvoy's perfect record at Goodwood did not survive the second race on the card, however. Al Sifaat, his mount in the Lupe Stakes, looked completely lost on the course and trailed in last. The winner was Halicardia, who took plenty of time to get going in the straight and looked to be hanging in behind the leader, Spotlight, before finally scrambling past in the final strides to win by a neck. \"She needs plenty of time between her races, so we are much more likely to wait for the mile and a quarter race for fillies at Royal Ascot instead of the Oaks at Epsom,\" Peter Harris, Halicardia's trainer, said. In the major shock of the meeting, Another Faux Pas took the fillies' maiden at odds of 100-1. \"I can't believe my eyes,\" her trainer Richard Hannon said. \"I don't ever remember being more surprised.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
