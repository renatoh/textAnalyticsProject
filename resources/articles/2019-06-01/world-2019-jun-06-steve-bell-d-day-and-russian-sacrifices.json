The sad fact is that the only Russian soldiers at Normandy were among the million who fought on the German side, many avoiding starvation and disease in prisoner of war and labour camps. Even sadder is the fact that those who survived would be returned to Stalin to be shot or sent to the gulags. And as far as the wreath with \u201cVictory and peace in Europe\u201d is concerned, please tell that to the half of the continent that then lived under the brutality of Soviet communist oppression for the next 45 years. If it wasn\u2019t for the sacrifices of D-day, that may have included France, Belgium, Holland and the rest. Jan Wiczkowski Prestwich, Manchester \u2022 I do not want to detract from the valour of those who landed in Normandy, but after seeing Steve Bell\u2019s cartoon I was reminded that the real war in terms of numbers was being fought in the east, where millions, not hundreds of thousands, were fighting. There were also already British soldiers fighting on the mainland of Europe who had, in fact, already defeated one Axis power. Just one mention of these facts in all the coverage on TV and in newspapers would have been welcome. I heard and saw nothing. Michael Prior Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire \u2022 Thank you, Steve Bell, for reminding us that, while we owe a great debt to the young men who lost their lives on D-day and after, our Russian allies were by then well on their way to winning the war in Europe on their own at the cost of at least 27 million lives: 17 million civilians and 10 million soldiers (the latter of which included 3 million systematically starved as PoWs in concentration camps).
