Robert Doyle will take the proposal to the next council meeting after pressure from police and a News Corp tabloid over homeless people sleeping at Flinders Street station. Rough sleepers have said it is one of the safest places for them. Earlier in the week Doyle said he would hate to be the sort of city to \u201cbundle people up and ship them out\u201d but he has performed a U-turn, telling the Herald Sun he will now argue for banning people from sleeping in CBD streets. The Victorian government is planning a meeting with police, the city council and homeless support bodies on Monday. It is the police who have argued for the bylaw. \u201cI am happy to put this proposal before councillors at our first meeting, if it is Victoria police\u2019s recommendation and they guarantee that they will enforce it,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cPolice already have powers to arrest for obstruction, for drug use, for threatening or aggressive behaviour, and for begging, and I would like to see them make full use of those powers as well. \u201cI welcome any move by police to bring an end to what has become a blight on our city, and the City of Melbourne continues to work with them to do that.\u201d The premier, Daniel Andrews, supported proposals for a new bylaw, saying the people at Flinders Street had turned down offers of housing and crisis support. \u201cLet\u2019s find these people somewhere to live, let\u2019s make sure the city is presenting its best self to our international visitors,\u201d Andrews told reporters on Friday. \u201cAnd then let\u2019s make sure that the police and the bylaw officers of the City of Melbourne have got the powers and resources they need to get that job done.\u201d The chief commissioner, Graham Ashton said rough sleepers were harassing tourists on the way to the Australian Open. \u201cThey\u2019re not homeless, these are people that are choosing to camp in the city,\u201d Ashton told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s more people around for them to shake down for money.\u201d He said he would deploy more officers to arrest people begging during the Australian Open. Those taking drugs of dependence would also be targeted. Some of the people lining Flinders Street say they are there because they want a safe place to sleep. \u201cWe\u2019re not begging and we\u2019re not hurting anyone,\u201d one, Tracy, told Australian Associated Press. \u201cWhat we need is somewhere decent to live \u2013 not to be victimised.\u201d Earlier in the week Doyle said if people were forced away from the station they would only move to other rough sleeping hotspots such as Enterprize Park, Treasury Gardens and City Square. \u201cThere are cities around the world where they simply bundle homeless people up and ship them out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d hate to think that we were ever that sort of city. We need to address the problem, not just do a cosmetic clean-up.\u201d Superintendent David Clayton said police used move-on powers for problems around nightclubs and protests, not for homeless people. \u201cIt\u2019s not an offence to be homeless,\u201d he said. Earlier in the week the heads of 36 organisations representing homeless people in Victoria signed an open letter criticising media coverage of homelessness in Melbourne, saying it \u201cfuels public fear and resentment\u201d. The letter was co-signed by the heads of Anglicare Victoria, Domestic Violence Victoria, Council to Homeless Persons, the Salvation Army and Whitelion, among others. \u201cVilifying people sleeping rough does not help them, splashing the faces of people in crisis in the paper only further stigmatises and isolates them, and fuels public fear and resentment,\u201d it said. \u201cYes, it is shameful that there are people sleeping on the streets in a country as affluent as Australia. The real shame is that this crisis has been with us for some time and it is only now that it has become visible in our streets that there is outrage and reaction. \u201cPerhaps we are more self-conscious of it with the international spotlight on us this week but this crisis is not a new one. And the causes of it are not new; Australia is in the grips of an affordable housing crisis that has been building over many years and we currently don\u2019t have a strategy for how we will solve it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
