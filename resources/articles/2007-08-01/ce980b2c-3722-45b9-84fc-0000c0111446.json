That isn't a plea for prospective husbands to contact me via the Guardian because, although in some ways I may resemble a slightly higher-class Jodie Marsh - currently organising her own nuptials though the medium of MTV - that act of romantic desperation isn't scheduled for my own life until at least 2009. But rather because, despite a very long list of ways to avoid work, I am running out of options. And it does seem to me that planning a wedding is a terribly effective and pretty legitimate way of not doing that much in the office, apart from looking at pictures of flowers on the internet and having screaming rows with your caterers over the phone, for a period of about a year. Once upon a time you could pretty much fashion a wedding party out of a barrel of beer and a maypole - these days nothing is so simple. There have to be fireworks and fairground rides and bands and DJs, and a five-course meal and canap\u00e9s before that and a buffet after that, and dresses requiring 52 fittings and bridesmaids that need medicating because didn't they tell you there was no way they were going to wear peach - and no matter how many times you call this colour \"salmon\", it is still peach. Planning a wedding essentially requires that you become an events organiser, with no training, experience or qualifications and nothing more important than the most important day of your life and potentially your entire future happiness resting on the outcome. It is no wonder that more trivial things, like your job, get pushed down the list of things that are important, coming to rest somewhere between the long-range weather forecast and finding sugared almonds that match the mother of the bride's hat. I love it when someone I work with is having a wedding, because three hours talking to your colleague about the relative merits of veils is excellent work-avoidance by-proxy. A s we hit the apex of the wedding season (a period of the year that some deluded people still call summer, despite all indications to the contrary), my excitement is mounting and my productivity is falling. Table decorations, place settings, seating plans ... there is no detail too minute for me to have an opinion on. It's a bit different when you actually get invited to a colleague's wedding, instead of just using it as a distraction . If you're real-life friends as well as desk buddies, it's fine - or at least no weirder than going along to any other social event where you're required to wear a hat, listen to men you've never seen before in your life give speeches, and share a dance floor with over-excited eight year-old boys skidding on their knees. But should you happen to be just-friendly-enough to be invited, it's distinctly odd to see the person you know as a ball-breaking line manager or office squash champion become the blushing focus of dewy-eyed maternal affection, object of another's undying true love and subject of a slightly lewd best man's speech. Then there are your other colleagues. Even though you barely tolerate them, they will become your best friends for the event, simply on the grounds that they are the only people you recognise amid a sea of anonymous strangers. Remember that you will have to face these people across a meeting room table at some point in the not-too-distant future, and a mental image of your efforts to recreate Christina Aguilera's most X-rated moves is probably not the one you want them to have in their minds. This is especially true if, at some point during your fifth glass of champagne, the romance overwhelms you and you are struck for the first time by the immense physical appeal of one of your colleagues. Do not act upon whatever impulse seizes you at that moment. Well, not unless you think it might lead somewhere. Like to a relationship, an engagement - even a wedding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
