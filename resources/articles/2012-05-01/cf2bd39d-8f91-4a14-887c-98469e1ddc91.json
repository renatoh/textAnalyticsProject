Also joining Robert Plant, Jimmy Cliff and Hugh Masekela on the bill will be Algerian singer Khaled, dubbed the King of Rai, and the blind singer-songwriter Gurrumul, an indigenous Australian. Other highlights include Switzerland's Mama Rosin who offer a take on the bluegrass of the American south and Mercury-nominated jazz band the Portico Quartet. Womad, the brainchild of Peter Gabriel, will take place in Charlton Park, near Malmesbury in Wiltshire, from 27-29 July, and will this year celebrate its 30th anniversary. Womad is the brainchild of Peter Gabriel. \"Many extraordinary artists have told us that Womad was critical to their international success, and was often the first time they had played to a 'foreign' audience. We are very proud of our role in bringing such great names as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Youssou N'Dour in front of a British audience,\" said Gabriel on Thursday, reflecting on his festival's 30th anniversary. \"Although a lot of other festivals have absorbed some of Womad's innovations \u2026 the family-friendly mix of music, film, dance and food from around the world \u2026 there is still something that happens at Womad that I've never seen elsewhere. Maybe its a willingness to explore, to try something a little different.\" The organisation today hosts festivals across the globe, from Sicily to Seattle, Adelaide to Abu Dhabi. \u2022 The Guardian is media partner for Womad festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
