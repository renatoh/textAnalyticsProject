Though it has set up a special unit to avoid schools having to go to a short week, the Department for Education learned only yesterday morning of the move by St Mary's high school in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, to send home 11 to 13-year-olds for one school day per fortnight. Fourteen-year-olds will also miss an hour's tuition twice a week. In all, 320 of the 941 pupils would be affected. The acting head Judith Reeve said she had taken the decision because she was unable to fill three vacancies despite contacting 18 supply agencies in the last four weeks. \"We are the equivalent of three teachers short, which has resulted in 58 lessons a week being uncovered,\" said Mrs Reeve. The school is short of teachers in maths and history, she said. It also needs part-time cover for English, geography, boys' PE, food studies and an adviser on careers and personal and sexual education. Last night, after concerted government activity, the school was offered two teachers from a supply agency and the offer of an Australian teacher in two weeks' time. It was not clear whether the school would accept the offer. Government sources were \"disappointed\" the school had not alerted the department or the local education authority earlier. Ministers are angry that schools may be rushing to cut the timetable without exploring other options. The St Mary's decision was symptom of \"a problem, not a crisis\", said a department of education spokeswoman. It emerged yesterday that Reading council is offering \u00a350 a night to the families of pupils prepared to put up teachers moving to the town. It is also offering \u00a3150 a week to staff who have to travel more than 50 miles to get to work. Ironically figures released today show a 10% rise in graduate teacher training applications - 13% for primary, 4% for secondary - by December 15, 2000 compared with the same date last year. Figures for the same dates released two weeks ago showed a 16.1% drop. The Graduate Teacher Training Registry blamed the Christmas post and a delay in processing applications. \u0095 Just how serious is the teacher shortage? And what should the government do about it? Join the online debate at www.educationunlimited.co.uk today at 4pm and interrogate Ralph Tabberer, head of the Teacher Training Agency (responsible for the \"Can Teach\" campaign), Gwen Evans of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, and Graham Lane of the Local Government Association."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
