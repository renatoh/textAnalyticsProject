Though the Australian prime minister was not present for the start of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\u2019 meeting on Tuesday, his country\u2019s presence at the forum has already been strongly felt, with Pacific leaders pointedly calling for Australia to transition rapidly away from coal use. Morrison\u2019s announcement of $500m over five years in climate resilience and adaptation funding for the region on Monday does not seem to have quietened concerns, with leaders saying the aid, while welcome, does not let Australia off the hook. Enele Sopoaga, the prime minster of Tuvalu and chair of the forum, said on Tuesday money was not enough. \u201cNo matter how much money you put on the table, it doesn\u2019t give you the excuse to not to do the right thing, which is to cut down on your emissions, including not opening your coalmines,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the thing that we want to see.\u201d On Wednesday Morrison is expected to have bilateral meetings with Sopoaga, New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern and the prime ministers of the Cook Islands and Vanuatu. The leaders\u2019 retreat, the main event of the forum, will take place on Thursday. It is looking increasingly unlikely that Pacific island leaders, who are calling for commitments to urgent and significant action to tackle the climate crisis, and Australia will reach agreement on a communique that satisfies both groups. Pacific leaders have singled out Australia\u2019s coal policy and its use of carryover credits to meet its obligations under the Paris agreement as issues they want action on. But on Tuesday Alex Hawke, Australia\u2019s minister for international development and the Pacific, who has been in Tuvalu this week, said Australia would not be shifting from its policies. \u201cWe would be lying to say we\u2019re not disappointed, extremely disappointed,\u201d said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, who has become a global leader on the issue of climate change. \u201cBecause Australia is part of the Pacific Islands Forum, they\u2019re the closest big country to the small Pacific island nations, they\u2019ve been here, they\u2019re here, they understand the situation. So it\u2019s very disheartening that their actions are not parallel with what we know they understand in terms of our situation.\u201d The urgency of the climate emergency is the focus of this year\u2019s forum.. A meeting of the Pacific small island states on Tuesday resulted in a declaration directly challenging some of Australia\u2019s policies, including calling for \u201can immediate global ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants and coalmines\u201d and for all countries \u201cto rapidly phase out their use of coal in the power sector\u201d. Sopoaga said: \u201cWe must push forward and seek urgent actions, concrete actions from the global community. I certainly wish our colleagues from Australia and others, will take heed of this imperative, so we can move forward.\u201d Hawke said Australia was committed to meeting its Paris targets, and would use carryover credits to help it do so. \u201cAustralia\u2019s position has been clear and, look, there\u2019s been great respect for Australia\u2019s position in general. People tell us that they want us to do more to help with climate in the region, and we are doing more.\u201d Hawke also referred to a speech by the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, on Monday, at the start of a climate change conference before the forum, in which Bainimarama appealed to Australia \u201cto do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change\u201d. Hawke said: \u201c[Pacific leaders] also tell us they understand our economy is structured certain ways and that to help with the assistance in the Pacific, Prime Minister Bainimarama was clear about this, we have to work through our own economic transition in Australia and the government\u2019s got our own plan to transition our economy into the future.\u201d The minister said the $500m for Pacific countries from 2020 was \u201cthe most amount of money that Australia has ever spent on climate in the Pacific\u201d. The money will go toward resilience and adaptation measures in Pacific countries and comes from the existing aid budget, though Hawke would not be drawn about which aid programs would be cut to pay for the new climate and oceans initiative. \u201cThe aid budget works in a number of ways, we\u2019ll be reprioritising some of those needs over time,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia is a good partner on climate because we understand from our neighbours the impact that it has. When you stand here in Tuvalu you understand the imperative about the climate and our prime minister will be here, I\u2019m here all week, we\u2019re listening and we\u2019re responding this week to the needs of the Pacific.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
