But without the heroism. Mike and Raj (not their real names) circle the bar, scanning for women, drinks held at an awkward right angle to their chests. When they identify a target, they approach. The women stiffen, their smiles tightening. They swirl drinks with straws and chit-chat politely before mentioning boyfriends \u2013 real or imagined. The men retreat, regroup, identify fresh women. Advance, engage, retreat. On and on it goes. I\u2019m standing with the man coordinating this operation, the British pickup artist Johnny Cassell, as he watches as Mike and Raj \u2013 his students \u2013 run drills. Tonight is the culmination of Cassell\u2019s intensive, day-long \u201cImpactful Connection\u201d workshop. For \u00a3700, Cassell promises to help men \u201cmaster the art of attracting the women you truly want\u201d. But watching as Mike and Raj hit on women indiscriminately, it looks as if any women will do. It has been a long and disturbing day. Arriving at the venue, a four-star Mayfair hotel that morning, I had found Cassell, 31, in a black mood: a client had just dropped out. Tall and handsome, with a wolfish air, Cassell switches between being charming and cold. He does not like being contradicted or mocked. At one point during the session, I joke about spreadsheets and GDPR violations. Cassell is visibly displeased. For the uninitiated, pickup artists (PUAs) are typically men \u2013 female artists are much rarer \u2013 who attempt to coax women into having sex with them through a mixture of flattery, psychological manipulation and coercion. The movement has a surprisingly long pedigree, dating back to Eric Weber\u2019s now almost 50-year-old manual How to Pick Up Girls. Today, this seems relatively sedate stuff. Weber writes, \u201cthe most important tenet of a pick up is that it\u2019s mutual \u2026 Women are entitled to say \u2018no\u2019, plain and simple.\u201d But the community really exploded into the public consciousness with the publication of Neil Strauss\u2019s 2005 international bestseller The Game, which sold 2.5m copies. It introduced a generation of men to the murky, underhand world of pickup artists and their nefarious tactics, such as negging \u2013 insulting a woman to undermine her confidence, and make her feel as if she has to seek your approval \u2013 or peacocking, where you dress flamboyantly as a talking point to hit on women. I went to university two years after The Game was published, and watched its influence spread like a virus through the men in my year: I don\u2019t think I went on a night out in 2007 without some drunk rugby player trying to \u201cneg\u201d me. What was once an underground community has grown into a seduction industry valued at $100m (\u00a375m). \u201cThe basic premise of all seduction teaching and practice is that interactions between men and women are subject to certain underlying principles that, once understood, can be readily manipulated,\u201d explains Dr Rachel O\u2019Neill of Warwick University, the author of Seduction: Men, Masculinity and Mediated Intimacy. \u201cThis is an impoverished view of sex and relationships, in which intimacy is less something to be experienced for its own sake and more something to be achieved for other ends.\u201d With the advent of the internet, elements of the pickup artist community\u2019s ideology hardened into something darker. \u201c[It] paved the way for other masculinised self-help formations to emerge, such as Jordan Peterson\u2019s 12 Rules for Life,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. Peterson, a Canadian academic, published his bestselling self-help tome in 2018 and is a critic of feminism. \u201cIt also connects with masculinist factions such as the incel movement [\u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d \u2013 characterised by an extreme hatred of women], and men\u2019s rights activists.\u201d This globalised network of pickup artists, men\u2019s rights activists and incels all emerged out of the same primordial sludge. Attending today\u2019s workshop are Mike, a 31-year-old tech worker, and Raj, 26, who lives in Dubai and works in finance. We sit around a circular table in a panelled conference room. Oil paintings of horses stare down at us. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 14 years,\u201d Cassell says. \u201cIt started off as a need for myself. Now I teach other people.\u201d Raj uses PUA terminology abundantly. \u201cI have an issue with approach anxiety,\u201d he says, meaning that he gets nervous hitting on women for the first time. He also refers to \u201csarging\u201d, the process of picking up women. Both Raj and Mike are (perhaps unsurprisingly) edgy around me. I shunt my chair into a corner and arrange my features into a neutral expression. The workshop begins with Cassell urging Raj and Mike to pick their dream women. Raj favours Kylie Jenner; Mike opts for Amber Gill, from Love Island. With the right mindset, Cassell says, they can bring their dream women into existence. He says reassuring if somewhat oblique things such as: \u201cYou are not a mass-market product,\u201d and, \u201cIf you are getting rejected, you haven\u2019t worked out what you want,\u201d and, \u201cThe magic word here is, choose.\u201d (Cassell writes \u201cchoose\u201d on the whiteboard.) Pop psychology session over, Cassell teaches them a conversation model. When approaching a woman, they should begin by making an assumption, before using a hook to draw her into conversation. Next they should challenge her, then introduce a time constraint and close the interaction by asking for a phone number. Raj and Mike hunch over their notebooks like dutiful schoolboys. In recent years, Cassell has been describing himself as a dating coach as well as a pickup artist, and avoids the worst excesses of the PUA community, such as sexually coercive tactics. Notorious pickup artist Daryush Valizadeh \u2013 known as Roosh V \u2013 was accused of advocating legalising rape, on private property, in comments he later said were satirical. The American pickup artist Julien Blanc was banned from entering the UK in 2014, after 157,000 people signed a petition protesting against his visit. Earlier this month, pickup artist Adnan Ahmed \u2013 who called himself \u201cAddy A-Game\u201d \u2013 was jailed for two years after being convicted of threatening and abusive behaviour. Ahmed would harass women on the streets of Glasgow, causing them distress, and offered tips on his YouTube channel on how to overcome \u201clast-minute resistance to sex\u201d. While his patter is assured, Cassell\u2019s teaching feels to me very similar to the message of Neil Strauss\u2019s seminal pickup bible. At one point, Cassell suggests challenging a woman who is into Crossfit by telling her that Crossfit is for people who aren\u2019t really good at any sport. This appears to be textbook negging. Conversational model learned, it\u2019s now time for what Cassell refers to as fieldwork, but would more accurately be termed street harassment. Thus follow two of the most dispiriting hours of my career, as I walk around central London in the rain, watching as Raj and Mike pester women. They pretend to ask for directions, and after the woman has pointed out the route, say: \u201cActually I just wanted to talk to you,\u201d or, \u201cYou look cute.\u201d At one point, Mike stops two women on Oxford Street and pretends to ask for directions. After they walk on, Cassell sends Mike chasing after them \u2013 he is convinced one was being flirtatious, because she crossed her legs while speaking to Mike. (She tells him she has a boyfriend.) Outside Fortnum &amp; Mason on Piccadilly, there is a surreal chat about whether the men should approach a young woman shopping with her mother. Cassell decides in favour of it, but by then, thankfully, the women have moved on. As a young woman who has experienced street harassment throughout my life, it is an extraordinarily uncomfortable thing to observe. I know that, on a fundamental level, women do not want to be approached in this way by strangers on the street. Not when they are running errands, or chatting on the phone, or on their way home from work. We want men to leave us alone. But I am here to observe. So I say nothing and we squelch on through the rain. I am struck by the fact that all the women being approached are uniformly young, slim, white \u2013 and uniformly polite. They smile and refer to boyfriends, but with the exception of one woman Mike interrupts having a cigarette outside Pret \u2013 who looks furious \u2013 they do not seem put out. Why don\u2019t any of these women tell Mike and Raj to get lost? \u201cWomen are socialised not to challenge men,\u201d explains Dr Bianca Fileborn of the University of Melbourne, an expert in gendered street harassment. \u201cBut this response may also be about managing the situation safely.\u201d When you confront a stranger you risk escalating the situation. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. These are men who\u2019ve already crossed your boundaries \u2026 deflecting them, by telling them you have a boyfriend \u2013 in effect, saying, \u2018I\u2019m the property of another man, please leave me alone\u2019 \u2013 can be a strategy for managing the situation.\u201d As we walk, Mike is having an internal tussle. \u201cYou do wonder, am I bothering people?\u201d he admits. \u201cEspecially with things like #MeToo. But then I think, you\u2019re being nice. You\u2019ve gone up to someone and said they\u2019re attractive.\u201d This message \u2013 that the men are doing a good thing, and that women enjoy being hit on in the street \u2013 is continually reinforced by Cassell. He urges them on, an officer rallying his troops. \u201cI want you to take that shot. You\u2019re just making someone feel better about themselves.\u201d After Raj is rejected outside Topshop (who knew so many women in central London had boyfriends?), Cassell reassures him he has done nothing wrong. \u201cShe\u2019s going to call her friend and say: \u2018Oh my God, this guy just hit on me!\u2019 You made her day.\u201d Outside Piccadilly Circus tube station, the cold rain whipping my face, Cassell repeats: \u201cYou\u2019re just making someone feel better about themselves. It would be selfish not to.\u201d That\u2019s not true. I think I am witnessing street harassment \u2013 something Fileborn makes emphatically clear. \u201cThis behaviour has a profoundly negative impact on women. It\u2019s often excused as flirting, or seen as good-natured. And on the individual incident level, I can understand why you might think that: someone came and spoke to you in the street, what\u2019s the big deal? But for many women, these aren\u2019t one-off experiences, but are repeated constantly, often from childhood. They add up.\u201d She sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t think men live with this experience of being intruded upon and having people feel entitled to your time.\u201d On we walk. I think about the smartly dressed man who said something crude as I was having lunch at a former job. I told him not to talk to me like that. His fury was sudden and total. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he snarled, as I recoiled in terror. I always remember how quickly the rage came, like it had been there all along. Eventually, we head back to the hotel. As the men write down their aspirations for the future, Cassell, surreally, puts on the score to Inception. We decamp to the hotel restaurant and eat while making stilted conversation. It is not an easy meal for anyone. The men feel that I am judging them. Mike says he thinks men should be physically stronger, so they can protect women, and waits for a response. I chew my food. Cassell tells me about a girlfriend who would prefer to pay a handyman rather than ask him for help. He didn\u2019t like that, he says. It made him feel redundant. \u201cWhat do you think about that?\u201d Cassell says, fixing me with a cold look. I make a feeble joke. And so, to the bar where the staff know Cassell and don\u2019t seem to mind that he is bringing men into the venue expressly to pester women. For the next three hours, Cassell identifies groups of women. The men trot over obediently. \u201cTry that blonde at the bar,\u201d he tells Raj. \u201cYou\u2019d only be adding to her night. She looks bored.\u201d Cassell suggests going up to a woman, saying \u201cTrick or Treat?\u201d, and then holding her wrist. At one point, Cassell sends Mike to sit with two women who are having a quiet drink. \u201cWhat should I say?\u201d Mike pleads. He is vibrating with nerves. In that moment, I feel sorry for Mike. It is easy to judge these men, but they are painfully introverted and shy \u2013 even childlike in the way they look to Cassell for answers. I don\u2019t think they are bad people. But they are denying women the chance to exist in public spaces without being treated as objects of desire. Just to be free, without an imaginary boyfriend or a place you need to be. The night wears on. \u201cI\u2019m not sleazy,\u201d Cassell says, apropos of nothing. My feet hurt and my chest feels tight with emotion. I say goodnight. Raj and Mike look relieved I\u2019m leaving. On and on they circle, men on the prowl."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
