It now looks very much as though there was a con man, a paedophile, a domestic abuser and a TV gameshow host staying there that night, sounding like the setup to a \u201cwho do you shoot first?\u201d joke. With the bombshells dropping thick and fast, the team are working flat out and, in a break from tradition, it\u2019s the guv\u2019nor who drops the ball. An insomnia-blitzed Cassie leaves Pete Carr\u2019s police file in a cafe. Before you know it, its contents are leaked online with council-estate Cassandra Sandra Rayworth leading the feeding frenzy. Crowd-sourced police work \u2013 what could possibly go wrong? Dr Tim Finch We finally get to meet Tim\u2019s much-maligned ex Derran this week and it\u2019s absolutely worth the wait. She tells a compelling tale of emotional, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Tim, \u201cthe most manipulating, calculating man I\u2019ve ever met\u201d. Her claims would have more weight if she hadn\u2019t hit Tim up for \u00a350,000 to keep quiet about them. But then there are those photos of a woman\u2019s bruised body she presents to the police. Younger daughter Claire dismisses the allegations as the ravings of an unstable woman. Her sister Emma is less emphatic. There is a look of niggling doubt on her face and Cassie and Sunny clock it immediately. Expect an impromptu visit from her before we tie this one up. Chris Lowe You can\u2019t help but be moved by how Chris has taken a shine to Asif. Even with all his problems, he finds time to make a connection with a traumatised child. That\u2019s just the kind of guy he is. It\u2019s no wonder Tim is so outraged at his treatment by Cassie and makes a formal complaint on his behalf. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been through some shit, Chris,\u201d he tells his old pal. \u201cAll done stuff we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Quite. There was that time Chris used his credit card to access child-abuse material online. The revelation from his estranged daughter Maya sends Sunny scurrying to alert Jamila. He gently suggests she might want to take Asif away for a few days to somewhere a bit more child-friendly. Peter Carr Say what you will about Pete, he seldom does things by halves. We can now add sacrilege and defrauding disabled people to his list of sins. Just like the charity theft in Hong Kong, the St Matthew\u2019s church caper of 1999 was an ambitious if flawed attempt to solve his perennial cashflow problems. Before he can get his bearings, he loses his wife, his job and gets a knife in the guts from a public-spirited vigilante as he arrives at his now former workplace. He is at least able to pass on to Tim something he saw concerning Elliot the night of Hayley\u2019s disappearance. If he dies, his final act will have been uncharacteristically helpful. James Hollis It\u2019s never a good sign when Daily Mirror readers know more about your husband than you do, so Amy is understandably miffed. James is contrite, but the story now has wings and he is powerless to stop it. Former partners come forward with tales of his worrying sexual predilections, but that may be the least of his worries. The police now know that Elliot was about to turn 16 when Hayley disappeared and Pete has broken omerta on whatever he saw Eliot do that night. Dark clouds are gathering. Notes and observations My money would be on Chris being a \u201cvirtuous paedophile\u201d, one who has never personally abused a child. The morality in Unforgotten comes in shades of grey. As unforgivable as viewing child-abuse material is, you just aren\u2019t going to get an irredeemable monster on a show as nuanced this. Continuing the theme of unseemly horrors from the past coming back to haunt you, Sunny\u2019s ex Usha wants to get the band back together. At the very least, he is considering it. She may have completely ruined the case and got one of the suspects stabbed, but on the plus side, Cassie has scored a dinner date with former DCI John Bentley. Swings and roundabouts. There is a great moment where James appears to say: \u201cI need to speak to my solicitor\u201d under questioning from his wife. Not the best optics when you\u2019re committing to greater transparency in the marriage. \u201cWhat if none of the friends murdered Hayley, but one of them found her body and each of them believes someone in the party did the deed, so they all went along with covering it up?\u201d Scaddict arrives at the bold conclusion that no one did it. It\u2019s better than anything I\u2019ve got. What did Elliot do? Is Derran on the level? Will Cassie ever get a decent night\u2019s kip? Please let me know below."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
