The Ivory Coast midfielder, who left City in May after eight years at the club, accused Guardiola of \u201chaving a problem with African players\u201d in an interview with France Football, also claiming the manager had ruined his final season in Manchester. But De Bruyne said he had not seen any evidence of Tour\u00e9\u2019s claims during his time at City and believes the 35-year-old\u2019s frustration at his lack of game-time may have played a part in his accusations. \u201cI never saw something. It would be weird if the trainer was racist \u2013 with all the black guys in our team,\u201d De Bruyne told BBC World Football. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know what Yaya said or if it\u2019s wrongly written or exaggerated. When you don\u2019t play there\u2019s always something you try to find.\u201d De Bruyne added: \u201cWe had the best season ever, so in the end the coach took the right decision to play with the team who played a lot. This year the trainer probably thought he [Yaya] wasn\u2019t doing enough, wasn\u2019t fit enough. I\u2019ve never seen something racist at the club, ever.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday Guardiola had refused to comment when asked to respond to the accusations. \u201cI am not going to talk about the words of Yaya Tour\u00e9,\u201d he said. But Tour\u00e9\u2019s agent continued the offensive by saying that his client would practically play for free for a top six Premier League club against Guardiola. \u201cYaya has received many offers from different countries, big money offers, but we have decided to devote the next season to Guardiola,\u201d Dimitri Seluk told sport24 . \u201cTo proving to the Manchester City fans that Yaya is not finished with football. He is full of strength and energy and wants to play in England this season. \u201cAt a time when English clubs are spending huge sums of money on players, I officially declare that Yaya is ready to move to any top-six English club as a free agent with a salary of \u00a31 per week. As long as a success-based bonus system is in place.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
