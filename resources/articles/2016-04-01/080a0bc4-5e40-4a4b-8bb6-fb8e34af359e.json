Fidel Castro seemed immortal, and there was nothing the US could do about it. US presidents came and went, the Berlin Wall fell, Cuba tottered and Castro, ambushed by illness, relinquished power. But still he resisted the \u201cbiological solution\u201d \u2013 a Washington euphemism for Castro\u2019s death. He clung to life, to defiance, and surfaced every so often to assail the capitalist enemy. On Tuesday the \u201cmaximum leader\u201d emerged into the limelight again but this time there was no thunder. It was, apparently, goodbye. \u201cI\u2019ll be 90 years old soon,\u201d Castro told the Communist party in a valedictory speech at the closure of its four-day congress in Havana. \u201cSoon I\u2019ll be like all the others.\u201d After decades of revolutionary fervour in marathon speeches and newspaper columns it was time, in an occasionally trembling voice, for a hint of elegy. \u201cThe time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban communists will remain as proof on this planet that if they are worked at with fervour and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need, and we need to fight without truce to obtain them.\u201d State television, in a delayed, edited broadcast, showed the former president, wearing a plaid shirt and sports top, seated at the dais in the convention palace, consulting notes as he spoke. Party members responded with shouts of \u201cFidel!\u201d Who could have guessed that the olive-uniformed rebel who overthrew Fulgencio Batista in 1959, who inspired and alienated generations of leftwingers, who flirted with nuclear armageddon during the 1962 missile crisis, who outlasted the Soviet Union and 10 US presidents, would make it to 2016, almost a nonagenarian, bowing to Father Time? Cuba\u2019s Communist party, however, is not bowing to economic difficulties or ideological pressure despite restored diplomatic ties with the US. The seventh party congress announced that Fidel\u2019s brother Ra\u00fal, who succeeded him in 2008, will retain the party\u2019s highest post alongside his hardline second-in-command. State media said Ra\u00fal, 84, would remain the party\u2019s first secretary and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura would hold the post of second secretary for at least part of a second five-year term. Ra\u00fal is both president and first secretary. The decision means he could hold a party position at least as powerful as the presidency even after stepping down from the government post in 2018. Machado Ventura, 85, is known as an enforcer of communist orthodoxy who has resisted cautious efforts to reform the island\u2019s moribund, centrally planned economy. Even high-ranking government officials had speculated a young reformer would succeed him. The party congress also decided against shaking up the powerful 15-member political bureau. It appointed five new members, none of whom were high-profile advocates for reform. Speaking at the congress closure, Ra\u00fal said it would be the last one headed by current leaders, signalling a generational transition in the next five years. \u201cThis seventh congress will be the last one led by the historic generation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
