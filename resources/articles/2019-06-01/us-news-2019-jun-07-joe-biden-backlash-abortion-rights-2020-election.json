But this week, the former vice-president stumbled as he skipped not one, but two progressive gatherings and flip-flopped on a key abortion rights policy after being criticized by his fellow Democratic contenders. The events ignited fresh questions over whether Biden\u2019s campaign is geared to withstand a crowded Democratic primary, where candidates must first court an increasingly progressive base before eyeing Trump\u2019s grasp on the White House. Biden, who has centered much of his candidacy around the notion of electability, will be missing in action on Saturday as nearly all other Democratic presidential candidates appear at the Iowa Democratic party\u2019s annual hall of fame dinner. His decision to forgo the cattle call in the first state to hold its caucus in 2020, comes on the heels of his absence at last week\u2019s California Democratic party convention and a forum hosted by the progressive group MoveOn.org. \u201cI think, quite frankly, they\u2019re afraid of the showing he would have in these settings,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a former aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cThese are settings where his frontrunner status might come under question if he got a low-key reception.\u201d He added: \u201cYou can potentially draw the conclusion that he\u2019s not courting these audiences, but I think they\u2019re afraid of a press narrative that might emerge if two, three, four other campaigns have a lot more enthusiasm.\u201d The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment. Since formally launching his campaign in April, Biden has kept a light campaign schedule and held far fewer events than the other Democrats jockeying for the top of the party\u2019s 2020 ticket. As the most experienced and well known entity in the field, he has instead focused on raising money and staying above the fray. His record on domestic and foreign policy issues \u2013 ranging from abortion and criminal justice to immigration \u2013 has nonetheless remained a subject of scrutiny. Biden\u2019s reluctance to directly engage with progressive voters has been received by some as a dismissal of their concerns. The ongoing questions surrounding Biden\u2019s past record were laid bare this week when he visibly struggled to explain his position on a controversial US policy barring the use of federal funds for abortion services. The 40-year-old ban, known as the Hyde amendment, makes exceptions for victims of rape and incest or to save a mother\u2019s life. While campaigning in South Carolina, Biden was caught off guard when approached by an activist with the American Civil Liberties Union who implored him to endorse an end to the Hyde amendment. Biden appeared to come out in favor of overturning the provision, only for his campaign to clarify that he still supported the ban. The backlash from other 2020 contenders, as well as progressive and pro-choice groups, was swift and severe. \u201cThis is not about politics, what this is about is about healthcare, about reproductive freedom, about economic freedom and about equal opportunity for all women,\u201d Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said at an MSNBC town hall on Wednesday. \u201cNow, some got lucky from what happened and some got really unlucky on what happened.\u201d The Hyde amendment, she added, has \u201cbeen wrong for a long time. \u201cBecause it really is, it\u2019s just discrimination.\u201d Vermont senator Bernie Sanders also rebuked Biden\u2019s stance in a tweet that did not mention his rival by name, but stated: \u201cThere is #NoMiddleGround on women\u2019s rights. Abortion is a constitutional right. Under my Medicare for All plan, we will repeal the Hyde Amendment.\u201d The reaction offered a glimpse of the pushback Biden is likely to face as the first Democratic primary debates are held later this month, and the skepticism he might face from progressive crowds and activists. Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist, pointed out that doing away with the Hyde amendment was both a part of the Democratic party platform in 2016 and a focal point of Hillary Clinton\u2019s agenda. \u201cBiden failed to recognize that the core of the Democratic party is in a very different place,\u201d she said. \u201cRepealing the Hyde amendment is in the party platform, and we are not going backwards.\u201d \u201cThe issue is even more acute in the wake of increasingly draconian GOP laws that disproportionately target women of color.\u201d By Thursday, Biden reversed his view and came out in favor of repealing the Hyde amendment, stating: \u201cIf I believe healthcare is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone\u2019s zip code.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability to ... exercise their constitutionally protected right,\u201d he added. Biden framed his evolution in part around a spate of extreme anti-abortion laws, pushed by Republican lawmakers across the country, that he said threatened women\u2019s access to abortion. At the same time, he said he was making \u201cno apologies\u201d for his prior support for the Hyde amendment. Fallon said the row over abortion was a microcosm of the kind of challenges Biden might encounter at the progressive gatherings he has thus far avoided. \u201cThere\u2019s been a recognition that the backbone of the party are people of color and women,\u201d he said, while adding the Biden campaign had \u201cmisjudged\u201d the temperature within the party on abortion rights. \u201cIt is not an issue that you can \u2018find a middle ground on\u2019. \u201cI suspect that there\u2019s going to be more issues that are going to come up where his approach of positioning himself as the centrist \u2013 and appealing to the moderates of the party \u2013 is going to run headlong into some positions where they might think they can stiff arm the left, but in the context of a debate stage are not going to play well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
