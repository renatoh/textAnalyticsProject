Fifa rejected Chelsea\u2019s appeal against the sanction, which was handed out in February and is due to prevent the club from signing players this summer and in January. The ban has not been frozen pending this appeal, which will be considered by a panel of arbitrators. The Cas said \u201cit is not possible to say at this time\u201d when a decision will be made. Chelsea have continually denied wrongdoing. The ban followed a lengthy investigation into how they have registered players at their academy over a number of years. Chelsea have agreed a deal with Real Madrid to sell Eden Hazard and the only guaranteed summer arrival is that of Christian Pulisic, who was signed from Borussia Dortmund in January and loaned back for the rest of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
