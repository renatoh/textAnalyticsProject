Like the works themselves, his playing and that of the pianist Cecile Licad is full of subtleties, the half-tones and inflections that make the chamber music of Faur\u00e9's final decade so elusive and fragile. Nothing here is forced or made to conform; whether it's the urgent outpourings of the first movement of the D minor Sonata Op 109 or the utterly different slow movement of the G minor Op 117, the pacing seems perfectly natural, the colouring distinctive. It's typical of Gerhardt's thoughtfulness that after the collection of earlier cello-and-piano pieces (including the well-known El\u00e9gie), which follows the sonatas, he should repeat the last movement of the first sonata at a faster tempo. Cellists disagree about Faur\u00e9's intentions; there's no doubt that the faster speed makes the music more focused, though at some cost to its introspective poetry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
