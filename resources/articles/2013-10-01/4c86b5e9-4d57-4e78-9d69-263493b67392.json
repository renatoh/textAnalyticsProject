Among the jockeys who took to Twitter to express their disgust was the champion, Richard Hughes. His colleague Shane Kelly said: \"The drains were blocked at the bottom of the weighing room where the valets work. It wasn't very pleasant and everyone decided you couldn't possibly work in those conditions. \"Unfortunately for Bath's stewards, there was no other alternative but to call the meeting off. More importantly than anything else, the valets couldn't work in those conditions.\" Hughes tweeted a picture of a flooded floor and said: \"These are the conditions Bath racecourse ask us to work in. We apologise to everyone who lost out in Bath today but enough is enough, Arc.\" Arc is the company that owns and runs Bath as well as many other British racecourses. Their spokesman, Kate Hills, said the problem was caused by \"torrential rain causing localised flooding \u2026 Drains were unable to cope with the continuous heavy rain. \"Jockeys were offered alternative facilities but after discussion with the stewards it was decided that racing had to be abandoned. We will be looking into this and we are doing everything we can to ensure this situation does not reoccur next season.\" At Kempton The New One showed his Champion Hurdle credentials with a devastating victory over the 2012 champion, Rock On Ruby. While Rock On Ruby was given an easy lead and appeared to get the run of the race, The New One shot past him at the top of the straight as soon as Sam Twiston-Davies asked for his effort. The New One's trainer, Nigel Twiston-Davies, father of Sam, said: \"We were worried about the fact that he'd not had much hurdling experience in his life but that was great and he jumped so well. He showed an amazing set of gears coming into the straight.\" He said the horse would be aimed at Cheltenham's Stan James International in December, possibly returning to Kempton for the Christmas Hurdle. The New One is now favourite with some firms for the Champion Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival in March and is no bigger than 5-1, having been 8-1 on Saturday morning. The odds for that race about Our Conor remain largely unchanged at around 11-2 after he was fourth in a Flat race at Naas on his first run since March. Dessie Hughes, his trainer, said he was \"delighted\", adding: \"The others have been running all year, whereas that's his first run. He'd be 90% fit.\" Our Conor is expected to run over hurdles next at Punchestown on 17 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
