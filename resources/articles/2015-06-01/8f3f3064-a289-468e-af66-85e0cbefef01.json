The awarding of the 2010 tournament to South Africa has come under scrutiny following a series of bribery charges against Fifa officials by the US authorities, who have made 14 arrests. The US district court has alleged widespread corruption within the governing body and detailed an alleged $10m payment that was transferred to Caribbean Football Union accounts by Fifa in return for three votes in South Africa\u2019s favour. The Fifa secretary general J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke denied responsibility for the $10m payment, writing in an email to the New York Times that he did not authorize the payment and did not have the power to do so. In a statement, a Fifa spokesperson said the payment was authorized by the then-finance committee chairman, and was \u201cexecuted in accordance with the Organisation Regulations\u201d. The chairman, Julio Grondona, died last year. Sepp Blatter has also denied being the unidentified high-ranking official named in the indictment as having \u201ccaused\u201d the payment. \u201cDefinitely that is not me,\u201d Blatter said at a news conference. South Africa was chosen as 2010 World Cup host ahead of Morocco in 2004 and Jordaan has insisted the payment four years later was not a bribe to secure votes. He told the South Africa\u2019s Sunday Independent: \u201cI haven\u2019t paid a bribe or taken a bribe from anybody in my life. We don\u2019t know who is mentioned there [in the US indictment]. And I don\u2019t want to assume that I am mentioned.\u201d He continued: \u201cHow could we have paid a bribe for votes four years after we had won the bid?\u201d The South African minister for sport, Fikile Mbalula, tweeted on Sunday: \u201cWe must never b [sic] afraid to face the truth even from our worst enemies #wedidnotbribe\u201d The US indictment alleges the $10m payment was made in 2008 to \u201csupport the African diaspora\u201d and divided between three co-conspirators including Jack Warner, then president of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football. The indictment reads: \u201con January 2, 2008, January 31, 2008 and March 7, 2008, a high-ranking Fifa official caused payments of $616,000, $1,600,000, and $7,784,000 \u2013 totalling $10m \u2013 to be wired from a Fifa account in Switzerland to a Bank of America correspondent account in New York for credit to accounts held in the names of CFU and Concacaf, but controlled by the defendant JACK WARNER, at Republic Bank in Trinidad and Tobago\u201d. Blatter was elected for a fifth term as president on Friday despite the arrests and controversy engulfing Fifa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
