So it's good to find Jude Kelly kicking off a three-play Priestley season with a rare revival of this 1939 expressionist Everyman, starring Patrick Stewart. If I admire the enterprise more than the result, it's because I sense Priestley straining every nerve to be experimental, and achieving a resonant simplicity only in the play's final section. It's certainly an extraordinary piece. An unexceptional businessman, Robert Johnson, looks back over his past life from the vantage point of a post-death limbo. The first part, in which he is subjected to fierce interrogation by agents of a bureaucratic global organisation, has echoes of Kafka and premonitions of Pinter, without the former's material accuracy and the latter's verbal precision. Things get even worse when the hero ventures into a nightmarish nightclub that is supposed to embody his repressed animalistic desires. Priestley's writing does not take off until Johnson begins to relive the quotidian joys and failures of family life before earning his spiritual release. Priestley's plays are always a mixture of realism and mysticism. But the problem here is that he starts out with the physical death of his hero and gets sidetracked into expressionist satire. We learn precious little about Johnson and a great deal about Priestley's vehement dislike of dehumanising corporatism and irresponsible hedonism. Priestley eventually remembers his real subject and, movingly, shows Johnson craving forgiveness from his children and re-encountering his wife, whom he was \"forever finding, losing, then finding again\". In its mixture of recollected pleasure and poignant regret for past failures, the play eventually touches a common nerve. Unsurprisingly, Jude Kelly's 100-minute production and Rae Smith's design mirror exactly Priestley's own weaknesses and strengths. We begin with Stewart's face projected on to a gigantic brick wall that gradually disintegrates as hands, bodies and telephones penetrate its surface. We move into Elmer Rice-style office satire, in which updated verbal references to the internet and homosexual marriages strike an anachronistically false note. But after the messily staged nightclub sequence, Kelly's production recovers its poise, with the hero finally walking across rippling waves towards an undefined peace. Stewart rightly refuses to make Johnson a glamorously heroic figure. He hints at the way in which youthful rebelliousness turns into middle-aged deference, but the keynote of his performance is a bemused sadness at missed opportunities. One of Stewart's best moments is his regret at failing to recapture his childhood passion for literature, in particular for the whimsical gallantry of Don Quixote. Stewart's understated performance and the surrounding versatility are admirable, but I still feel that Priestley's play is one in which the will struggles to do the work of the imagination. \u0095 Until September 29.
