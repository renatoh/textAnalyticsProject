This week the quartet have featured on American talk shows and recorded more than 500,000 likes on their Facebook page while USA Today reported that the winter Olympics may as well call off the competition now: the Norwegians have already won. The reason? The outlandish outfits that were unveiled for their tilt at Sochi 2014. \"It is a fun headline, but it is not like that,\" Christoffer Svae, 31, second on the Norwegian curling team, says, laughing. \"I have a friend backpacking in Singapore and he called me up and said that there is no winter sport on the TV here but I see your face all over [the place] because of your pants. So I think it is just helping to market the sport in a way that hasn't been done before.\" Black pants and a coloured shirt are standard curling garb but the Norwegians took it to a new level at the last Games in Vancouver when they inadvertently created their own style. \"We received the black T-shirts and jackets from our [Norwegian curling] federation quite late and there were no pants to go with the set, so we decided to go ahead and find some more colourful pants to get some of the nation's colours in there; red, white and blue,\" says Svae. \"We just happened to find these diamond shaped, red, white and blue pants online and decided to buy them.\" The Norwegians won a silver in 2010 but afterwards on social media many believed Norway had won because of the blanket coverage they got for their trousers, Svae says. The Norwegians have since been sponsored by the British company that manufactured the trousers, Loudmouth Golf, and have been playing in every colour available. When they revealed their kit for next month's Sochi Olympics this week, their fans were not disappointed. \"We feel pretty good about it: it is just a way to make our sport popular and get into the media. I think it will be popular around the world and hopefully more people will come and check it out. So I feel we contribute on and off the ice. We are a pretty decent curling team \u2013 and also we have this going with the fashion,\" he says. However, Svae plays down any suggestion it will make a difference to their Olympic performance. \"I mean, obviously the first couple of days of the Olympics last time, people looked once or twice when we came on the ice in colourful pants. Now we have played like this for a while, so I don't think it gives us an advantage. \"When we feel good wearing a uniform we play better, so within the team it might have given us an advantage \"Right now we are focusing on the Olympics. We have a media day on Wednesday and then we are heading off for Switzerland for our pre-camp; we'll relax and practise and prepare.\" The Norwegians will be in action on 10 February against USA in the first round of the 2014 Olympics curling competition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
