For the locals, the latter is a bit more important. The Ireland captain leaves for Toulon after the World Cup. In fairness to him, the gap between announcing that decision and playing his last Test in Ireland is not something that developed into a soap opera. \u201cThere seems to have been a lot of final everythings for me in the last while: final game in Thomond Park; final game for Munster; and I suppose it just drags on a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly with Munster in those final few weeks I thought about it a lot, but it hasn\u2019t really bogged me down this week. \u201cIt\u2019s my first start [of the Guinness series] so it\u2019s more about where I\u2019m going to be in terms of my play and my fitness. That\u2019s where my mind is at the moment. I\u2019ve had a good pre-season but it\u2019s still been two and half months since a game [start] and I\u2019m eager to get out there and see where I am and put in a good performance rather than dragging on a long goodbye.\u201d On the performance front Ireland have one very good one and one mediocre one \u2013 against Wales and Scotland respectively \u2013 while Wales, with a shorter run-in, need to look good now. \u201cI know that Wales would have been really disappointed with their performance in the first game and they\u2019ll be way further down the track in terms of what their plan was from a conditioning point of view,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very much a different team.\u201d One of the big differences will be the presence of O\u2019Connell\u2019s lineout partner from the Lions tour two summers ago, Alun Wyn Jones. \u201cThey did really well in the lineout against us in Cardiff this year [Six Nations] where we lost four lineouts: a five-metre drive where we\u2019ve been fairly successful in recent years; we lost a five-metre exit lineout which was vital, where they scored subsequently. So do I enjoy it? I probably do but there is a lot of work and thought goes into it and I think he\u2019s [Jones] got a lot better as the years have gone by. I thought we really struggled against them so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to put right.\u201d At this late stage in his career however there is one thing he won\u2019t be able to correct: his status in the squad of fashion criminal. \u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2013 it\u2019s constant abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to do it to John Hayes and I never thought I\u2019d be that guy who was getting slagged about my taste in music, my taste in clothes and everything like that. If I could take those times back when I used to slag him I would now because I\u2019m constantly on the back foot from all the lads. But it\u2019s good fun. I get on great with them. I enjoy the training and matches more than ever. There\u2019s still stress and pressure that goes with them, but I think I handle it better than ever.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
