The only notable dissident is Daniel Libeskind of Ground Zero fame, who has questioned the seemliness of building for an authoritarian and undemocratic regime, under which construction workers endure the most primitive of conditions, with minimal safety provisions and poor wages. A few more, having experienced the minimal fees offered by most Chinese developers, have quietly refused to work there. But that has not stopped an unprecedented architectural stampede, led by Rem Koolhaas, Norman Foster, and Jacques Herzog. Despite everything, there is a sense that building here is one of those rare chances architects get to make history, so how can they say no? This is a capital that has rebuilt itself faster than any other in the history of the world. In two decades it has moved from the middle ages, with an overlay of bicycles and Stalinism, to a shimmering surreal vision, two parts Las Vegas, two parts Dubai, and five parts the most brutally unequal capitalist society on earth. Everybody with any pretensions to an architectural profile has looked at working there, from David Adjaye and Will Alsop at the more radical end of the spectrum, to the large scale plan factories exporting off-the-shelf designs for ready-made cities. Whether they wanted to or not, they have created exactly what their Chinese clients were looking for: a new city that looks like the capital of an emergent superpower, in which the factories of the communist era have been swept aside, making way for showy vulgarity, the bizarre, the wilful, the inept, and the occasional masterpiece. Despite the promises to shut every construction site and dismantle every crane in time to let the dust settle for the Olympics, Beijing still looks like a vast building site. Looming over the Olympic stadium is a highrise tower that more or less behaves itself for its first 20 floors and then suddenly erupts into a gigantic Elvis quiff, rearing up another 15 floors and taking a terrifying cantilevered leap into space. Not far from Tiananmen Square, still presided over by Mao's effigy, you can find an army of labourers putting the finishing touches to what taxi drivers proudly declare is the city's first six-star hotel. It's designed in a florid late 19th-century Belle Epoque style, rising like a huge meringue over the surviving fragments of the hutongs, the traditional courtyard houses that once characterised the entire city which have been demolished to make way for the next highrise. The first piece of genuinely western grade modern architecture in Beijing, Denton Corker Marshall's Australian embassy, was built remarkably slowly by a construction brigade of the People's Liberation Army. It was finished in 1992. Since then, an entire new city has been built around it. Context is not something Beijing has done well since the days when the north-south axis that runs through the city was violated by Mao's creation of Tiananmen Square. This was adorned by the erection of a monument to the heroes of the People's War, an act that was followed by the still more damaging placing in the exact centre of the square, blocking the axis, of Mao's mausoleum in what, were it not for the revolutionary statuary, would look like the library for a moderately ambitious Midwestern campus. While the Olympic venues are already complete, the city centre is not. The museum on the west side of Tiananmen, facing the Great Hall of the People, is still a shell. Behind the walls of the old legation district, a huge new shopping district is under construction. Its mainly elderly, or migrant, inhabitants have been cleared out to make way for what is aimed at becoming the city's answer to Covent Garden in London. All that is finished in this part of the city is the Grand National Theatre, designed by Paul Andreu, the architect responsible for Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. It is a monstrous gesture, a metal egg with the tedious inevitability of symmetry. To make matters worse, it is sunk into the middle of a circular lake - not so much a boiled, as a fried, egg. It's a moat that does nothing to relieve the barren monotony of Tiananmen Square. Equally troubling is American architect Steve Holl's project by the second ring road. Holl has designed an apartment complex: a cluster of a dozen towers, linked by two-storey walkways 20 storeys up. Beijing's architectural evolution has gone from Stalin, who summoned Chinese architects to Moscow for fraternal lessons in authoritarian Art Deco classicism, to post-modernism, by way of a brief episode in revivalism that saw offices blocks topped by giant tiled roofs and lacquered dragons. Now it is a place where anything can happen. \u00b7 Deyan Sudjic is director of the Design Museum in London The Olympic Stadium Herzog &amp; de Meuron's awe inspiring 91,000-seat stadium, known, because of its latticed surface, as the Bird's Nest, is the defining landmark, not just of the Olympics, but of the new China, the emergent superpower that is using the games to mark its breakneck transformation from Marxist-Leninist backwater to glittering metropolis. Its steel structure is of a complexity that tested Chinese technology and manufacturing to its limits. As a monument it has a richness and depth that take it far beyond the simplistic cult of the icon. Herzog &amp; de Meuron have done nothing less than reinvent the athletic stadium. Instead of an isolated object, cut off from the city around it, the bird's nest is designed to create public spaces that come to life even when the stadium is not in use. As the most conspicuous of Beijing's new landmarks, it has also been sharply criticised by Chinese architects who have been angered by their exclusion from the most high-profile projects. Aquatic Centre The Olympic pool is sheathed in a huge plastic skin, patterned on the structure like a soap bubble. Designed by the Australian architects PTW, it looks best at night, glowing translucent blue, a quieter counterpart to the structural flamboyance of the stadium on the other side of the Olympic green. It's designed as a deliberately understated counterpoint to the stadium that adjoins it and which is given pride of place in the crush of much less interesting buildings that press in from all around. The Grand National Theatre Within sight of the courtyards of the Forbidden City, and on the edge of Tiananmen Square, the Grand National Theatre is impossible to ignore and perhaps the most questionable of the city's new structures. Designed by Paul Andreu, the architect for Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris, it has a ruthless symmetry. Its titanium and glass shell is sunk into the middle of a circular lake that acts a moat, the most anti-urban gesture imaginable. Its three halls are reached by tunnel, ducking under the water, to take visitors into the most lavishly finished interiors in Beijing. China Central Television/ Mandarin Hotel The CCTV towers will not be ready for the Olympics. Nor, despite earlier claims to the contrary, will the Mandarin hotel adjoining it. Yet the complex is already one of the city's most conspicuous new structures. Both are designed by the same team, Rem Koolhaas's Office for Metropolitan Architecture. They have produced the most aggressive, and determinedly transgressive, landmark for Beijing. The earthquake-defying form - and huge structural overhangs which leave tens of thousands of square feet of office space supported, apparently, by nothing - look bizarre even in a city in which anything is possible. The hotel and offices can be read as a single, extraordinarily violent architectural composition, a wildly thrashing monster, its tail flapping up and down, trailing behind two giant elephant's legs. It has taken architects in China 20 years to get the hang of building sophisticated polished skins. With the CCTV headquarters, Koolhaas has decided that the mark of true sophistication for China is to look rough. To deal with all those extreme cantilevers in an earthquake zone takes a great deal of structural skill, here provided by Arup engineers. It also needs a fair bit of steel, which is applied, apparently at random in strange clusters, some stopping mid-flight, others going off at odd angles, creating the impression of a darned sock, or structural Band-Aid, applied retrospectively to patch up the cracks. China World Trade Center 3 Beijing's tallest tower, the China World Trade Center 3, is the third instalment in a development that has become the heart of the city's business district, a thicket of towers that sprouted almost by accident between the first crop of international hotels and the diplomatic enclave. As contemporary high-rises go, at only 1,083ft , it is relatively modest. Shanghai's World Financial Centre is half as high again and the Burj al Arab tower in Dubai, now reaching completion, will be more than 2,000ft, but Beijing knows how to impress with more than sheer size. Designed by the American firm, Skidmore Owings and Merrill, it's a skyscraper that stands out for its quiet reticence. The tower, with its gently tapered form and carefully pleated metal and glass skin, is an elegantly cut Brooks Brothers suit, with curious echoes in its gothic base of Minoru Yamasaki's Twin Towers destroyed in the 11 September attacks in New York. When it's finally completed next year, the first 50 floors will be earmarked for office use, with 22 hotel floors on top. Jianwai Soho When I first saw this project in 2003, you could still find slogans from the Red Guard days on the walls of the few remaining factory compounds that were once China's pride and joy, in the process of being flattened to make way for a new capitalist city. Working for Soho China, run by Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin, the most innovative developers in Beijing, the Japanese architect Riken Yamamoto has created a huge complex of flats, shops and cafes. There are 20 towers, containing 7 million sq ft of space, ranged in a careful grid. Bejing Airport Bejing's new terminal is essentially a new airport. Cross the threshold and you are dazzled by what feels like a landscape rather than an interior. A sparse collection of giant columns, white inside the glass walls, red outside, hold up its delicate, refined roof. Norman Foster has more experience than most of designing airports. Stansted, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok and now Beijing have each moved a step further in perfecting lightweight structures. Beijing's sweeping roof, elegant as a sand dune, has been peeled open here and there to allow in flashes of daylight while the glass walls show the ranks of jumbos outside."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
