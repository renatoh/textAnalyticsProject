The Spaniard, who won three Open titles between 1979 and 1988 but missed the cut on his last six appearances and has not contested the event since 2001, has been suffering from arthritis. \"I'm a lot better but I'm not completely ready because I have to feel 100% physically,\" he said. \"And then I need some time to regain my game.\" Ballesteros, sleek and slimmer by 12lb since he started an exercise regime, spends at least an hour stretching every day. \"That's the most important,\" he said, \"but the other exercises help too.\" He is not, he says, taking painkillers and has not been able to bear going on to a course for seven months. But he believes his comeback is not far away. \"Hopefully I will be back before the year is over. I want to be sure that when I do return I will not be going home a week later.\" The house in which he was speaking is located close to the Troon course and there was a poignant moment when he said: \"It is very sad to be here in a room 200 yards from the 1st tee knowing that you are not going to be able to tee off. Not to play the Open is also very sad because it is the No1 tournament in the world.\" Asked if he saw any of the modern players possessing the same degree of skill and imagination that he brought to the game, Ballesteros said \"No\" and - never mind that he was appearing on behalf of the golf manufacturer Callaway - he blamed new equipment. \"The [new breed] all play well and they hit the ball for ever with the new technology. But it is that technology which is so good that is taking away the skill from the game. It is hard to move the ball right and left; they just stand up and hit it miles and the ball comes back to the middle of the fairway as if it had radar.\" And his tip for the Open? \"Maybe,\" he said, \"Sergio Garcia. He has been playing well in the States the last few weeks.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
