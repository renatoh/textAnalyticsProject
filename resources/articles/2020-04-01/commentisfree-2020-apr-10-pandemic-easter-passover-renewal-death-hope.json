We would have been surrounded by bleakness and death just as nature had shrivelled up and the trees were stripped bare. But this plague refused to conform to any pathetic fallacy of our making, choosing instead to arrive with the spring. The news bulletins speak of a UK death toll of nearly a thousand a day. Outside your window, the sun is shining and there is blossom and bloom. There is something cruel about that. Especially for those whose homes are cramped \u2013 an overcrowded flat, say, with no outside space, no room for a barbecue or paddling pool \u2013 a glimpse of blue sky and a warming sun might well be tantalising and taunting, a joy that is painfully out of reach. Even for those lucky enough to have a garden, it will seem perverse. Spring is about life and renewal, while all around is death and sorrow. And yet the timing brings consolation, too, and not just because an hour of licensed exercise is more enticing if the weather\u2019s fine. True, it might be odd to talk of timing when it\u2019s not always obvious what day it is. We\u2019ve become unmoored from the calendar and even the clock. (With no evenings out, some are finding that every night is an early night.) Those furloughed or unaccustomedly working from home find themselves in an unfamiliar limbo: their surroundings suggest they\u2019re off work, and yet they\u2019re not on holiday. When the distinction between work and home is already blurred, and when you\u2019re not allowed to go anywhere, a four-day holiday weekend can seem \u2026 confusing. But this period is about more than a couple of days off. It is also Easter and, for Jews, Passover. In normal times, plenty of people wouldn\u2019t care less about such things. But when the calendar is a vast blank of undifferentiated time, when the other, collective rituals of the season have gone \u2013 there\u2019s no football outside Belarus \u2013 then, for many, the ancient structures are all that\u2019s left. The key event of Passover is already behind us: the seder, when it is all but compulsory for Jewish families such as mine to gather together. (Think Christmas dinner.) Nothing said lockdown more coldly than the oxymoronic prospect of a seder in isolation. And yet, somehow, we managed it. Thanks to Zoom, relatives in scattered parts of north London, as well as in-laws in the countryside and a son and a niece abroad, several of them on their own, joined together to retell the story of the ancient Hebrews and their escape from slavery in Egypt to freedom. Over wobbly video link, and often out of sync, we sang the familiar songs, the melodies taught by generations long gone. At a second Zoom seder with friends, we broke off at 8pm to clap for the NHS and other carers. Before I\u2019d seen it, I thought that, like the weather, there would be something cruelly perverse about the notion of Passover in lockdown. It is billed as the \u201cfestival of our freedom\u201d, and yet we were to be under virtual house arrest, separated from those we love. But once the seder was under way, I felt my resistance receding. Sure, the video feed was glitchy and lagging, but we were experiencing it together. And the threat of the virus only made the proceedings more poignant. We were recalling a time when our ancestors were not free; when 10 plagues struck the land of Egypt; when people cried out for their ordeal to end. All that felt less abstract this year. The story of the seder is one of hope: after slavery, liberation. And the story of our seder was one of hope too: that even confined to our homes, we can connect. Now, I have confessed before that, despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 my Jewish upbringing, I have always been a sucker for the Easter story. It does not merely converge chronologically with Passover \u2013 some like to speculate that the Last Supper was, in fact, a seder \u2013 it converges thematically too. While Jews tell a story of emerging from enslavement to freedom, Christians move from death to resurrection. It\u2019s starker, but it offers that same message of hope \u2013 that even after the greatest pain, there is renewal. Right now, we might not have the head for such talk. We are still held captive by corona. We cannot go out; doctors, nurses and care workers still lack the protective equipment they need; key government decisions, over vital testing most obviously, seem to have been botched. Too many people are dying. And we have not even begun to contemplate what happens when the virus strikes those countries without sophisticated healthcare systems: recall that Central African Republic has a total of three ventilators for a population of 5 million. Naturally, people are desperate to see even a glimmer of light at the end of this tunnel. They\u2019re impatient for it: witness the questions about an \u201cexit strategy\u201d from lockdown, the demand for it to be eased sooner rather than later, if only for the sake of the economy. But just as we don\u2019t really know how quickly or how well the body recovers from Covid-19, we don\u2019t know how \u2013 or if \u2013 the economy will recover, or what will happen to our society. We know so little. The message of the Easter or Passover stories, and the signal sent by the arrival of spring, is that life will return, one way or another. It may be a small consolation, but for a few hours this strange, sunny weekend, let\u2019s cling to it. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
