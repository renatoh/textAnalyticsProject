One way of calculating it is to look at the current death rates for each age group and then work out an expected age of death. This is called period life expectancy; the Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimate for this at age 65 in 2010 was 83 for men and 86 for women. These are the figures most commonly reported in the media and the kind quoted in Mr Ball's letter, but they make no allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. Most organisations that use life expectancy calculations in their work (for example, insurance companies and pension fund trustees) do make an allowance for future improvements, since the evidence is that there have been significant increases in life expectancy at every age group over many years, and there is no reason to assume this will stop for at least a while yet. On this basis, the ONS principal projections estimate that 65-year-olds in 2010 will actually live on average until 86 (men) and 89 (women). These are called cohort life expectancies. So, the pensions minister Steve Webb was not being at all misleading when he said \"most 65-year-olds can expect to live until their late 80s\".
