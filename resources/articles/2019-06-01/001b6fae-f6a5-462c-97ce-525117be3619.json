Carlos Maza, a video journalist for the US news site Vox, went public last week with a complaint that the rightwing YouTube personality Steven Crowder was engaged in a long-term homophobic harassment campaign. In a compilation video Maza created of some of his mentions on Crowder\u2019s show, the host attacks Maza as a \u201cgay Mexican\u201d, a \u201clispy queer\u201d and a \u201ctoken Vox gay atheist sprite\u201d. YouTube initially argued that Crowder\u2019s \u201ccriticism\u201d was debating rather than harassment, saying in a public statement on Tuesday: \u201cOur teams spent the last few days conducting an in-depth review of the videos flagged to us, and while we found language that was clearly hurtful, the videos as posted don\u2019t violate our policies.\u201d It changed its decision on Wednesday, saying that upon review it found Crowder\u2019s channel \u201chas harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies\u201d and that it would be demonetised, meaning advertisers would be removed from the channel. \u201cIn the past, we felt our responses to some of these situations were slow and didn\u2019t always address our broader community\u2019s concerns,\u201d YouTube said in a blogpost. \u201cOur ultimate goal here is to streamline our response so we can make better, faster decisions and communicate them clearly.\u201d The company initially said Crowder\u2019s videos did not breach its harassment and cyberbullying policy, which explicitly bars \u201ccontent that makes hurtful and negative personal comments/videos about another person\u201d, or its hate speech policy, which bars creators from using \u201cstereotypes that incite or promote hatred\u201d based on attributes including ethnicity and sexual orientation. \u201cThis has been going on for years, and I\u2019ve tried to flag this shit on several occasions,\u201d Maza said when he posted the initial video about harassment. \u201cBut YouTube is never going to actually enforce its policies. Because Crowder has 3 million YouTube subscribers, and enforcing their rules would get them accused of anti-conservative bias.\u201d Responding on Wednesday morning to YouTube\u2019s decision, Maza said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to get so much worse now. YouTube has publicly stated that racist and homophobic abuse doesn\u2019t violate their anti-bullying policies. Crowder and his allies are going to be emboldened. I genuinely can\u2019t imagine what LGBT employees at YouTube are doing right now. \u201cYou can harass queer people as much as you want as long as it\u2019s sandwiched between \u2018debating\u2019.\u201d He also appeared to be unsatisfied with YouTube\u2019s decision to demonetise Crowder\u2019s videos, saying: \u201cCrowder\u2019s revenue stream isn\u2019t from YouTube ads. It\u2019s from selling merch and \u2018Socialism Is For Fags\u2019 shirts to millions of loyal customers, that @YouTube continues to drive to his channel. For free.\u201d YouTube\u2019s response has sparked a wave of criticism, with many noting that it came five days into Pride month. The main YouTube accounts on Twitter and YouTube are decked with rainbow flags to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. The company is still addressing its last crisis, after a New York Times report found that a paedophile ring that YouTube attempted to shut down in February was not only still operating, but also being aided by the company\u2019s own algorithm. Videos of children in swimwear and underwear were being linked together by the video-sharing site\u2019s recommendation algorithm, creating an automatic watchlist for paedophiles who trawl the site for \u201cborderline\u201d content that sexualises children without breaking child exploitation laws. The company refused to remove recommendations from videos of children, arguing that doing so would hurt creators who rely on the recommendations to drive an audience to their videos. It did, however, introduce a rule requiring any minor livestreaming on the site to be accompanied by an adult. In February, YouTube said: \u201cAny content \u2013 including comments \u2013 that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. \u201cWe took immediate action by deleting accounts and channels, reporting illegal activity to authorities, and disabling comments on tens of millions of videos that include minors. There\u2019s more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
