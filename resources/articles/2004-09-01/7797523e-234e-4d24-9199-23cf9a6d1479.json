In fact, it starts from Putney and ends just a few yards downstream from Chiswick road bridge, near Twickenham. Details from www.theboatrace.org. The clue for 21 across in cryptic crossword 23,254 was \"19 with singular garment on his legs\", to which the solution was \"rampant\". Ram comes from 19 across, pant is a singular garment, and \"on his legs\" is rampant. The solution printed on page 38, September 23, wrongly gave the answer as \"remnant\". Sid Vicious lived from 1957 to 1979, not from 1957 to 1959 as we said in a panel accompanying a report about the new Dictionary of National Biography (Pytheas, Diana, the singing postman, page 3, September 23). We misspelled the name of the goalkeeper Kasey Keller, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur, as Casey Keller in a match report, page 36, September 23. The \"blessing from a gypsy\", page 64, Jobs &amp; Money, September 25, should have come from a Gypsy. We capitalise it. The stylebook notes that Gypsies are recognised as an ethnic group under the Race Relations Act. Gary is not \"wracked\" with indecision, Pick of the Day, page 28, G2, yesterday. He is racked. The stylebook says: wrack - seaweed; racked with guilt, not wracked. It is the Guardian's policy to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please quote the date and page number.
