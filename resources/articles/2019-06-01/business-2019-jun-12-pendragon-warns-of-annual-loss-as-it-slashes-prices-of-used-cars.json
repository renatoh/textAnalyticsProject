The company, which trades under the Evans Halshaw, Stratstone and Car Store brands and sells all the main marques, predicted a small pre-tax loss in 2019, excluding proceeds from US disposals. Pendragon warned that the first half of the year would be \u201csignificantly loss-making ahead of returning to overall group profitability for the second half\u201d. Its share price plunged almost 23%. City analysts had expected the company to make a profit of almost \u00a335m this year. Last year it posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a353.2m after a \u00a392m writedown. Analysts at Jefferies are forecasting a \u00a36.9m loss before tax for 2019, having previously predicted a profit of \u00a331.4m. Pendragon, which has 32 stores that only sell used cars and 177 franchised dealerships, said there were \u201csignificant\u201d declines in prices in the used-car market, with dealers having to discount heavily to shift excess stock. The firm was left with used cars worth \u00a3458m at the end of 2018, up from \u00a3372m a year earlier. Prices are also being slashed to enable carmakers to hit volume targets. The company\u2019s used-car stores ran up losses of \u00a311.9m in 2018 and these are expected to widen to \u00a325m this year, partly because of higher costs, particularly in after-sales. Industry figures out last week showed new car sales in the UK fell 4.6% in May year on year and were down 3.1% for the year so far. The car industry has been hit by weaker consumer confidence as Brexit uncertainty remains, and by a slump in demand for diesel vehicles because of confusion over new emissions rules in the wake of the \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal. Pendragon wants to pull out of the US to focus on the UK used-car market, which it still sees as an \u201cexciting opportunity\u201d despite the current problems. It announced the sale of two dealerships in California for \u00a360m in May. The firm\u2019s new chief executive, Mark Herbert, is carrying out a full review of its businesses that could lead to the breakup of the company and will announce the outcome in September. Herbert took over from Trevor Finn on 1 April. Finn retired unexpectedly after almost 30 years at the helm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
