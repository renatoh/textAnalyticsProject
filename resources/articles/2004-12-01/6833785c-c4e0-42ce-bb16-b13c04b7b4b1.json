He is one of those former footballers who views everything as propaganda; only the game matters. There are plenty of Newcastle United fans who think the same; it is just that the game has not been kind to Newcastle for some time and on Boxing Day they go to Blackburn Rovers seeking a first league win since November 20. The one before that came on October 24. Blackburn, of course, were the club Souness left in September to succeed Sir Bobby Robson at St James' Park. Rovers will not make it easy for Newcastle, who have won one and lost five of their last eight Premiership games. With Alan Shearer, Nicky Butt and Stephen Carr still out over the Christmas period, there is no great optimism on Tyneside that Ewood Park will witness an upturn in Newcastle fortunes. And Newcastle have not won in the Premiership at Blackburn. After that it is Arsenal at home next Wednesday and then Birmingham City at St James', which is shaping up to be intriguing. Pessimism dominates and within that there is doubt about Souness's abilities as a manager. There are also the beginnings of antipathy and that perhaps is why Souness mentioned his neck. \"Am I quoted as saying that?\" he asked. When told yes, Souness added: \"I don't see it that way. We've played 19 games and I've lost six. That's the price on the ticket at this club, at any big club.\" A man who has undergone open-heart surgery, Souness frequently relates football situations to his medical history and did so again yesterday. \" This is not pressure,\" he said. \"I see myself as being extremely lucky to be working at one of the best football clubs in the world. And the excitement and the thought of what we can achieve here is with me every minute of the day.\" Souness has a remarkably relaxed disposition, given his firebrand reputation. It may be one reason why the theory sprouts that he could walk away from Newcastle calling it \"unmanageable\" or some other phrase, yet publicly he is defiant. In the last week he has described the atmosphere around the club as \"Latin\" and has repeated a mention of \"mischief-makers\". Yesterday he dug his Prada heels in. \"It only makes me doubly determined,\" he said of the growing criticism. \"That's the way I am, head down and work harder. I have a fantastic group here and everybody is fully focused. \"I'm 51 years old, so obviously I have experienced a fair bit in my life. Whatever I am, whatever any of us are, comes from what we have experienced of the downside of life. \"Because of difficult times in my life professionally and personally I am what I am. People can have their opinion of me, we are in the opinion business. That's how it should be, we live in a democracy. But I have such a strong belief in my own ability that it doesn't really matter what is said about me.\" What will be said at Blackburn should be interesting. A Newcastle defeat would assure the Rovers hierarchy that they were right to allow Souness to leave the club freely. Alternatively a first Premiership win for Newcastle there and the mood would brighten swiftly. Suddenly those questions about Souness's \u00a37m offer for Rangers' central defender Jean-Alain Boumsong - why so much when only Newcastle want him? Why do they want him? Why does Souness buy so many Rangers players? - would give way. But lose at Blackburn and that expensive scarf around Souness's neck will feel less comfy. Even Boumsong, who is on between 10% to 15% of his transfer fee, might think twice about Newcastle, though his agent would surely strangle him for doing so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
