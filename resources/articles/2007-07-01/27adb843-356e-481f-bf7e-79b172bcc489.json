John Gosden's four-year-old returns to Ascot today and, provided the ground does not become too soft, he can make the transition to Group company. With Ryan Moore taking over in the saddle, Out After Dark (4.35) looks set to return to winning form. Clive Cox's sprinter met all the trouble going last time. Archived (3.25) is fancied for the nursery at Ascot, and another to note in similar grade is Captain Dunne (5.30) at York. He will appreciate the return to five furlongs. With his confidence at an all-time high, Greek Well (3.15) is the one for the John Smith's Cup. The divisions of the juvenile maiden race at Salisbury tonight should prove informative. Though he might just need the run, the newcomer Hawk House (7.05) is expected to figure prominently, and Brian Meehan's Gimcrack Stakes entry Fast Company (7.35) goes well. We gather jockey Richard Hughes was most impressed with Meehan's Sharp Nephew, whom he rode to a stylish win at Windsor on Monday. This colt is set for a step up in class at Ascot's King George meeting in two weeks' time. A newcomer who could make the headlines at this Monday's Windsor evening meeting is Aye Aye Digby (8.00) Lady Deauville (3.05) has improved for her promising debut outing and we are advised not to miss her at Nottingham today. Ralph Beckett, who is having a good run with his two-year-olds, should be on the mark with Fox's Den (3.40) Rambling Light is one to be on next time. Off the track since March, Andrew Balding's colt needed the run when a close fourth at Kempton last week. He can win off his current mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
