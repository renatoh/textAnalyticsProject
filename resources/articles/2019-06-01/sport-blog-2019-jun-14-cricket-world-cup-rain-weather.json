Updike writes: \u201cRabbit has always liked rain. It puts a roof on the world.\u201d We might just be getting through it now but this has also been the theme of the cricketing week. The pulleys have clanked, the gears thrummed into life and that summer roof has been winched into place in a way that is either maddening, or comforting, or oddly subversive depending on your angle of interest. On Monday South Africa and West Indies lasted seven overs in Southampton. On Tuesday Bangladesh v Sri Lanka was a washout in Bristol. On Thursday India v New Zealand collapsed into a series of thrillingly doomed hourly pitch inspections before the familiar post-lunch surrender. There has been a degree of dismay at this, and understandably so. It has been a hugely absorbing World Cup. Fifty-over cricket continues to look the most balanced of all three formats. And best of all the conditions have rewarded high skill in every discipline rather than weighting the game tediously one way. Power hitters such as Jos Buttler and Hardik Pandya have picked the rhythms of early June, deflecting and guiding the ball as well as swinging straight through the line. Even Chris Gayle, who basically just stands there now like death himself, scythe raised, chillingly tall and still and creaky, has dug a little deeper; playing later, showing more care for his pads and stumps and adapting just enough to cleave a quick 30 at the Hampshire Bowl. We\u2019ve had fast bowling at every turn. We\u2019ve had Mohammad Amir\u2019s brilliance, a redemption story in the making for anyone with half a heart. And beneath it all this week we\u2019ve had rain, and the lessons of rain, and the relief of rain passing, and the promise of more to come before it\u2019s all done. But then this is England, a place where rain is not simply a glitch, or a subplot overlooked and glossed away. Rain is cricket in England. This island is surrounded by rain, by a sea that at times curls itself up at the edges and takes to the skies. It might not rain every day, or rain in showy, flashy chart-topping dumps. This is a more nuanced relationship, rain as an unceasing possibility, a note in every conversation. Rain winds itself into every detail and every ritual. Even the language is packed, lovingly, with rain descriptors, rain patter. Drips, drops, spots and spits. Stair rods and cats and dogs. Summer rain, bitter rain, hard rain. Rain that sets in. Rain that dances and tickles and skips across. Dogged, low-level rain that somehow soaks your jeans to your skin and plasters your hair without seeming to raise itself above the status of a light mist. And naturally rain is there in English cricket, which is essentially an exercise in defiance of rain, a rebuke to the shadow of rain. To play cricket is to think and know and care about rain, to have opinions and theories on rain, to stand around saying: \u2018It\u2019s coming from over there. This is high cloud. The sky is definitely lighter that side. This, I can feel in the hairs of my forearms, in the tendons of my knee, is going to pass.\u2019 There is also a kind of cruelty here. No other sport does this to itself. There is no other global World Cup that can simply be rained off, that can be planned for 13 years then wiped out by a chance cloud formation. On a personal level there is no other sport so fraught with doubt and detail, no other sport where you practise all winter, torture yourself with the prospect of failure, where months are spent honing tiny mechanical details \u2013 and then the whole thing is called off for a month because it\u2019s chucking it down. Oh, the rain-riven cruelty. You might even say cricket only really exists as a global thing because of rain, that the urge to sail forth and colonise is there because of cold winters and damp summers, an island nation with the itch to go beyond its own rainy Jerusalem. The colours of this World Cup in England are striking. Those flags say, we came for your summer. Now here you are, sheltering from ours. But rain is more than this. It is something else too, rebellion and resistance, and also beauty. There is a brilliant comedy in the presence of rain even at this, the most controlled, triumphalist, carefully monetised World Cup. Rain tells you the summer game is also about melancholy and boredom, that this is a story told often in minor chords too, its moments of colour bordered by vital passages of grey. In the current battle for the sport\u2019s soul rain stands on one side saying this is not a product to be sold by the yard. Formats will come and go. But you have to be made to love cricket, not simply offered it up ready-made. In England, at least, the uncertainty remains. Cricket will always fight with the skies. We are at least through it for now. The skies are clearing. TV won\u2019t be happy. Those who count the cost will count the cost but the weather has made its point. The pallet has been cleansed. And from here the World Cup will taste a little sharper and a little sweeter for the passing rain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
