Some have their eyes closed, others fiddle with their hair. Everyone is bathed in sound: rich, velvety jazz played out by Tokyo-based producer Chee Shimizu, on a sound system built and customised to the highest specifications. The mantra tonight is inspired by the culture of the listening bars that proliferated in Japan after the second world war: \u201cTalk less, listen more.\u201d It\u2019s a concept now influencing nightlife everywhere from S\u00e3o Paulo to San Francisco, Barcelona to Berlin, where bars, cafes and restaurants are aiming to satisfy even the most ardent audiophiles. When music is both so freely available and disposable, and hi-fi equipment is increasingly expensive and esoteric, it seems a high-risk gamble. How did the listening bar catch on? \u201cI think it\u2019s part of a larger movement, like slow food and mindfulness,\u201d says Colleen \u201cCosmo\u201d Murphy, a DJ, producer, founder of the Lucky Cloud party and the world\u2019s most popular record club, Classic Album Sundays. \u201cYounger generations especially never grew up with the experience of listening to music on high-end equipment. Now most people can\u2019t access it because it is quite expensive, but when you offer a public venue, they can hear [music] differently than they ever have before.\u201d Murphy, a celebrated audiophile in the music industry, is wide eyed. \u201cIt\u2019s like only eating McDonald\u2019s all your life and then going to Le Gavroche for the first time and being \u2018Oh, food can taste like this?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of hard to keep going back because you\u2019re very used to it, it\u2019s convenient \u2013 and fast food still has its place in the world.\u201d It\u2019s a theme backed up by Aneesh Patel who owns the east London bar and restaurant, Brilliant Corners, with his older brother Amit. There is a noticeable trend, he says, of people rediscovering what it\u2019s like to listen to music on a decent sound system \u201cin the same way there are similar trends in other things involving slowing down the senses\u201d. Brilliant Corners, named after the Thelonious Monk album, hosts Murphy\u2019s Classic Album Sundays listening events alongside album launches and specialist sessions, but it was predicted to fail within two years. The warning came from Amit and Aneesh\u2019s father, who now gets misty-eyed at their success. At the time, he couldn\u2019t understand why his two successful lawyer sons were devoting their time, energy and money to a place that couldn\u2019t even afford staff in the first few months. They were inspired, says Aneesh, after witnessing parties whose organisers would travel to venues with their high-end sound systems to build and dismantle them just for one night. The Patels were baffled that there was no permanent venue in the country that could offer the same consistent audio quality, and so six years ago, helped by friends, they opened the bar after work on a Friday until the early hours, and reopened on Saturday and Sunday nights before rolling back into work on Monday. Since then, Spiritland (in King\u2019s Cross and the Southbank), In Sheep\u2019s Clothing (Los Angeles), Public Records (New York), Hang Dai (Dublin) and many more have opened their doors. Each of them follow the ethos of allowing music to cocoon customers with all the detail, depth and texture of its original recording, at the optimum decibels with fine-tuned audio equipment. The idea is to be able to speak, drink, eat and listen at a level where everything can be heard and no one needs to shout. It\u2019s an experience that may seem anathema \u2013 or a welcome relief \u2013 to most on a night out in the city where, more often than not, the music is too loud, people screech to be heard, and the clang of cutlery against crockery becomes abrasive white noise. This is unlikely to change anytime soon: it has been repeatedly proven by scientific studies that the louder and livelier the music is in pubs, bars and restaurants, the faster people drink, eat and spend more money. But a backlash against that is now thriving, albeit as a subculture. Paul Noble, co-founder of Spiritland which reportedly hosts a sound system that costs close to half a million pounds, says the principle is \u201cto give respect back to the artists and their creativity\u201d. Sitting down and listening to music actively, rather than as a background hum in a permanently stimulated, multi-tasking environment, is not a luxury many people often indulge in. Specially created social spaces hope to offer the next best thing. \u201cWhen the mood is right and the lights are right and the music hits you, it\u2019s a magical experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a lot of discourse and hype and bullshit in music, but at the centre there is something really valuable worth celebrating.\u201d But not everything sounds great at an audio level this advanced: modern pop designed for earbuds is often highly compressed, while record labels have created a cottage industry of reissued albums aimed at burgeoning music fans that, to the trained ear, are simply a sham. Justin Greenslade, who handcrafts and builds audio equipment for venues and producers, including the set-ups at Brilliant Corners and Spiritland, is enthusiastic about the listening culture but unimpressed by the bandwagon circling it. \u201cDigital releases sound dreadful because they don\u2019t come from the original reels on which they were recorded, and now majors are re-releasing albums on vinyl that came off CD.\u201d Greenslade\u2019s studio in north London is rammed with a boggling assortment of equipment. He winces at being labelled an audiophile, although does admit that he spent the previous evening at a \u201cmixer party\u201d hosted in a room above a pub. To clarify: it was an event for sound engineers and enthusiasts to evaluate each others mixers. \u201cPaying attention to the acoustics of the room \u2013 low ceilings, panels, is the most important thing,\u201d he says to anyone looking for advice. \u201cAn affordable but well implemented system will always sound better than an expensive one in a concrete bunker.There\u2019s an awful lot of snake oil in the hi-fi industry.\u201d Murphy agrees. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018best sound system\u2019, it\u2019s subjective. Once you get to high-end audio, when they say they have \u2018the best\u2019, it means they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d She guides me through her intricate stereo set-up at home, where one room houses all her records and the family space is organised around an awe-inspiring level of audio nerdery. \u201cSomeone like Colleen is a rarity,\u201d says Noble. \u201cShe\u2019s totally lived her life in pursuit of perfection. Most DJs turn up, play the tunes and take the money, say goodnight.\u201d Why is it so important to her? \u201cBecause music is so important to so many people.\u201d Trends forecaster Sabrina Faramarzi, whose work focuses on uncovering patterns across socio-cultural phenomena, says the scene has yet to peak and predicts there are many more such spaces to come. \u201cRight now, we are re-learning how to explore our experiences with sound,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the future, I think we\u2019ll see more stuff around touch. Both senses are the first we experience in the womb, so they feel safe. Our visual sense, which is our most over-stimulated, is developed much later. A lot of people forget that sound is a physiological experience. So much of our world is visual, and the increased popularity of listening bars \u2013 and even podcasts, audio books and ASMR [autonomous sensory meridian response] \u2013 are an antidote to excessive screen time.\u201d At Classic Album Sundays events, where people can spend a couple of hours listening to an album together in a communal public space, phones are turned off \u2013 but their absence causes a noticeable twitch. \u201cIt takes about two songs for people to properly switch off and relax,\u201d says Murphy. Earlier this month she hosted a session for Joni Mitchell\u2019s Blue; next month she\u2019ll play Erykah Badu\u2019s Mama\u2019s Gun. Satellite album events are hosted across the US, Europe, Australia and Japan. In September, Amazon launched a higher tier of its music streaming service allegedly aimed at audiophiles: lossless versions of audio files \u2013 tracks that are of CD rather than standard digital quality \u2013 which couldn\u2019t be matched by Apple and Spotify and were priced at a level that undercut rival Tidal. Over on the high street, Neil White, a senior buyer at Richer Sounds, says that although wireless and smart speakers are \u201cflying off the shelves and are by far our biggest sellers\u201d, electronics stores predict that these customers will \u201ccome back in the next two years to invest in better quality hi-fi equipment again. The convenience of Bluetooth speakers is the entry point for the average customer to listen to music like they used to.\u201d Murphy says that \u201clistening to music in any way is great because it\u2019s listening to music\u201d. People often come up to her from the dancefloor at Lucky Cloud to ask what the song she just played was, and then don\u2019t believe it\u2019s something they already knew. \u201cIt\u2019s because,\u201d she says, \u201cthey never heard all the layers and parts of it before.\u201d That revelation in sound is what keeps everyone interviewed hooked. \u201cI can listen to things now that I might have found boring or challenging before and can listen to them in so much detail and have more patience for it and it can wow me with its intricacies,\u201d says Aneesh. For him, and the others, the public appetite for active, immersive listening and a resurgent interest in quality audio equipment can only be a positive thing \u2013 even if it has sent prices through the roof: the Klipschorn loudspeaker, now a staple for bars claiming audiophile status, standing at 5ft tall and first manufactured 73 years ago, could be snapped up for less than \u00a310,000 five years ago. They now sell for around \u00a318,000 each. Audiophile culture may never really have gone away but younger audiences seem more interested precisely because our ears never switch off and are so battered by sound. \u201cIt\u2019s odd to go to a lot of clubs these days where they give out earplugs,\u201d says Aneesh. \u201cYou wonder why dont they just turn it down so you can use your normal ears. It\u2019s quite a weird concept to have a sound system set up, but then stuff something in people\u2019s ears so they can still feel it, but not hear it properly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
