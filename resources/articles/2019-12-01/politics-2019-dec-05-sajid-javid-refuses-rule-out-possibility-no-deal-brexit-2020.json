The chancellor was repeatedly asked on Thursday whether there was a possibility the UK could leave with no deal at the end of 2020. He said the chances of that were \u201cextremely remote\u201d but dodged several opportunities to rule it out. He claimed the outline of a free trade agreement had already been worked out, saying: \u201cBy the end of 2020, we will have agreed and finalised the trade deal, a very ambitious, deep, comprehensive free trade agreement. And we will get that done also by the end of 2020. \u201cIn the time that we\u2019ve been negotiating over the last 100 days or so, it wasn\u2019t just the exit agreement ... we have also negotiated and worked and agreed the outline of the ambitious free trade agreement. \u201cThere is not a single doubt in my mind that it can be agreed within months, and we can get it through parliament by 2020.\u201d Asked what tariffs the car industry would pay under such a deal, Javid said: \u201cBecause it\u2019s a deep, comprehensive free trade agreement, it\u2019s zero tariffs, zero quotas, not just for the car industry, an agreement on services, having equivalents on financial services, we\u2019ve set all this out.\u201d Tory ambitions to pass a tax-cutting, post-Brexit budget within 100 days of taking office have been dismissed by opposition parties, who cast doubt on the feasibility of the timetable. The Liberal Democrats described the plan as \u201cpure fantasy\u201d and accused Boris Johnson of lying to the public. It was put to Javid that Johnson had only managed to secure a new Brexit deal by agreeing to a customs border in the Irish Sea \u2013 which had previously been a major red line \u2013 but he did not respond to that point. Painting a stark choice between a Tory majority government and a \u201cchaotic\u201d coalition following a hung parliament, the chancellor also restated his party\u2019s key pledges to increase spending on the NHS and schools, recruit more police officers and raise the threshold at which people begin making national insurance contributions. Asked whether he would have written an article comparing veiled Muslim women to letterboxes, as Johnson had, Javid refused to criticise his party\u2019s leader. \u201cI don\u2019t write articles,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a journalist and he\u2019s written lots of articles, as he\u2019s said himself, people can pick one word out or another but what matters is the kind of prime minister he\u2019s going to be.\u201d His comments came a day after it emerged that Johnson had claimed that children of working mothers in low-income families were more likely to \u201cmug you on the street corner\u201d. Javid, a former Deutsche Bank director, was also asked whether the Conservatives were ashamed of rising homelessness under the party. He sought to deflect blame towards Labour, which had claimed government policies had been \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for people living and dying on the streets. \u201cI care deeply about the worst off in our society,\u201d Javid told Sky. \u201cHomelessness reached its peak in 2008 under the last Labour government, since then it\u2019s down by almost a half. There\u2019s still a long way to go, we\u2019ve still got work to do, but it\u2019s Labour that was responsible for the massive rise in homelessness.\u201d However, later on Thursday, Javid was roundly criticised and accused of lying by the chair of a leading thinktank. \u201cJavid is lying. The number of people sleeping rough has increased by nearly 300% since the Tories came to power in 2010,\u201d tweeted Tom Kibasi, from the Institute for Public Policy Research. The fact-checking charity Full Fact said in a statement: \u201cThis morning on Sky News, Sajid Javid claimed that homelessness had fallen by half following a 2008 peak under Labour. \u201cThis does not seem correct. Homelessness in England was about the same in 2017 as in 2008, and has risen since 2010, by the main measure.\u201d The housing charity Shelter also said it was wrong to claim that homelessness had gone down. Javid also restated Tory plans to introduce an Australian-style points-based system for immigration. \u201cWe have a right to control our borders and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get with the Conservatives, is this Australian-type system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will mean we will have immigration, of course we will, and immigration \u2013 I say this as a second-generation migrant myself \u2013 has benefited our country immensely in so many ways.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 December 2019 to remove an inconsistency in a date reference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
