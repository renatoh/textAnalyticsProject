Social distancing has also inspired artists to experiment with new mediums \u2013 Fake Friends, a Brooklyn-based theater company, released a new play that intersperses its live stream with eye-searing internet memes. More than anything, these online events allow audiences to connect during a time of isolation, support beloved cultural institutions during an economic crisis, and make sense of a world turned upside down. The Joyce Theater Foundation: State of Darkness Dates: On demand through 7 November Tickets: $13 Seven dancers offer their take on one seminal solo: Molissa Fenley\u2019s State of Darkness, an 1988 piece set to Igor Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring that has been acclaimed as \u201ca raw and daring tour de force\u201d. All-inclusive tickets will give you access to all seven performances as well as a conversation between Fenley, the dancers and Peter Boal, a noted interpreter of the role. Los Angeles Times: Festival of Books, Stories &amp; Ideas Dates: Ongoing through 17 November Tickets: Free The Los Angeles Times postponed its spring book festival and is now offering access to all events free of charge.

New York Public Library: The Harry Belafonte Black Liberation Speaker Series Dates: Ongoing Tickets: Free Inspired by this summer\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests, which sparked a national reckoning on race, the New York Public Library is organizing several talks on race and literature.

Fake Friends: Circle Jerk Dates: On demand through 7 November Tickets: $5-$50 Circle Jerk is a raucous, livestreamed, multi-camera play set on the fictional Gaymen Island. Produced by the Brooklyn-based theater and media company Fake Friends and backed by playwright Jeremy O Harris, it is \u201ca queer comedy about white gay supremacy, a homopessimist hybrid of yesterday\u2019s live theater and today\u2019s livestream (set in tomorrow\u2019s news cycle)\u201d. The New York Times calls it \u201ca lot\u201d, but if now isn\u2019t the time for unconventional theater, then when is? Art Basel: OVR \u2013 Miami Beach Dates: 2-6 December Tickets: Free Art Basel\u2019s Miami Beach edition is typically a place to be seen as much as to view art, but this year the art festival will take place entirely online.

Art Miami, which usually runs parallel to Art Basel Miami, will put its galleries online during the same dates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
