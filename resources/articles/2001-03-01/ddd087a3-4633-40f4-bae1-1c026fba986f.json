Released from the three-month purdah imposed after he resigned suddenly last November, Mr Woodhead began his new career as a writer for the Daily Telegraph by accusing the prime minister of being \"incapable of seeing anything through\". Mr Blair \"has failed to focus with sufficient rigour on what he repeatedly declared to be his number one priority\", Mr Woodhead said. This allowed Mr Blunkett to preside \"over a set of initiatives that has wasted taxpayers' money, distracted teachers from their real responsibilities and encapsulated the worst of the discredited ideology that has done so much damage since the 1960s\". Mr Blunkett adopted a measured tone in a statement last night, praising Mr Woodhead's work as chief inspector but rejecting his criticisms. His close colleagues were rather less sanguine in private. Mr Woodhead wrote that he decided to quit as chief inspector because he could no longer support many of the government's policies. He \"no longer knew what to say\" when head teachers complained about bureaucratic interference. \"As a taxpayer I could not stomach the way in which public money was being squandered and, as an individual, I was no longer prepared to waste my time in discussions that had no connection with the classroom.\" He recounts a meeting of Mr Blunkett's Standards Task Force where a member said the term teachers should be replaced by \"learning professionals\". When none of those present - including the school standards minister, Estelle Morris, and Michael Barber, Mr Blunkett's senior adviser - seemed to agree \"the time had come, I realised, to go\". But Mr Woodhead said he was torn about whether to resign. The issue was forced when Mr Blunkett discovered during the Labour conference last year that the chief inspector was thinking of resigning. At the end of a second meeting, Mr Woodhead wrote: \"I concluded that he wanted me to go - and the sooner the better. He could then appoint someone who might cause less trouble.\" Mr Woodhead points to a \"black hole\" in government education policy - \"the failure to understand that education is important because it is intrinsically valuable, not just because it contributes to our social and economic good\". Mr Blunkett's friends rejected this view last night and said that Mr Woodhead himself had constantly argued behind the scenes for a primary curriculum that had no prescribed subjects beyond literacy and numeracy, and lobbied for the introduction of more vocational qualifications. The chief inspector said he had only one conversation with Mr Blair about education away from his advisers, snatched on a staircase at a party at Buckingham Palace. \"As I spoke, his brow furrowed and the usual smile vanished .\" A Downing Street spokes-man said: \"I have no interest in helping columnists promote their columns. This government's commitment to raising standards is total and remains so.\" Answering back Chris Woodhead: \"I have often wondered why Tony Blair seemed so sympathetic and yet turned out to be so incapable of seeing anything through. The real problem, I believe, is that he has failed to focus with sufficient rigour on what he repeatedly declared to be his number one priority. So reluctantly and sadly, I concluded that Tony Blair would never push through the reforms that we both - in theory - wanted. Nor was he prepared to force David Blunkett to follow my advice... \"David Blunkett has presided over a set of initiatives that has wasted taxpayers' money, distracted teachers from their real responsibilities and encapsulated the worst of the discredited ideology that has done so much damage since the 1960s. He has just not delivered. A generation of children has been betrayed.\" David Blunkett: \"It is a shame that Chris Woodhead has chosen to start his career as a Daily Telegraph columnist in the way he has. But that doesn't change my view that he made an important contribution to our shared goal of raising standards as chief inspector. \"My drive to improve schools has come from the deepest personal conviction born from my own experience of what it is like to be let down by school and seeing pupils in my constituency not getting a decent education. That drive and passion has been shared at all times by a prime minister who has a greater commitment to education than any of his predecessors. \"As a result of that drive this government has achieved considerable progress. It is simply untrue to suggest that the measures we have taken have not made a difference.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
