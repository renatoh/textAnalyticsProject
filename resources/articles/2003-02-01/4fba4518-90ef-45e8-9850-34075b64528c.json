Shazia abandoned teaching and is now an award-winning comedienne, with numerous television appearances under her belt, including her own BBC show. \"The BBC came to watch me do stand-up on several occasions but I didn't know that at the time,\" recalls Shazia. \"Eventually I was asked to do my own show and I devised 10 Things You Always Wanted To Know About Islam (But Were Afraid To Ask) , aired last November.\" Shazia, who grew up in Birmingham, moved to London after graduating. \"Teaching seemed a good way to earn a relatively good living, while getting used to a live audience,\" she says. While teaching she studied drama and went on a comedy-writing course. Then in September 2000, on a cold Saturday night in Brixton, she did her first gig. \"It started at 1am and I had an audience of 300 drunken young people,\" she recalls. \"There was no microphone and no stage, so I had to stand in the middle of the room. It was so scary, I thought I was going to wet myself. But after my first few gags, people started laughing. That's all I remember and after that stand-up comedy seemed like the most natural thing in the world to do.\" It wasn't long before the accolades and lucrative work started to pour in. She became so busy that she quit full-time teaching in July 2001 to work as a supply teacher. Shazia credits her determination to fight for what she wants and take risks with helping her to achieve her goals. She advises students and graduates to do the same. Now her career ambition is to make her mark on the other side of the Atlantic - possibly working with George Clooney. \"He's gorgeous!\" she says. adeline@worksmart communications.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
