ICT can be used effectively at all stages of the design and make process and in all four focus areas. In electronics, for example, software can help create a more accurate printed circuit board, while in food technology a nutritional database enables more effective modelling of a new food product. Computer Aided Design (CAD) software used with equipment for Computer Aided Manufacture (CAM) enables students to achieve high quality products in both resistant materials and textiles. Can I use my school's generic software in D&amp;T? Using spreadsheets enables students to model the cost of producing individual products and larger batches. The wide variety of graphing tools provide a means of accurately presenting the results of surveys and questionnaires undertaken as part of research, and radar graphs are particularly effective in creating product profiles. In addition, spreadsheets are a useful project management tool, used to create GANNT charts and other, more detailed time plans. PowerPoint and word-processing software greatly enhance the look and feel of project work, particularly when digital images of made items are incorporated into portfolios. I only have access to one computer in my room, how do I use it effectively? This is a common classroom management issue that needs careful organisation. It is important that the computer is used all the time, so it may be best to set a focused task, related to the main design and encourage an activity that all students need to complete. Many computers have an outlet for a large screen monitor that will support whole class teaching, enabling opportunities for demonstration. It may also be helpful to book a network room for very focused teaching and then encourage students to practice new skills in the D&amp;T lessons. Where can I find out more? Look on the Design and Technology Association's websites, including three specific sites to support Cad/Cam, electronics and food technology. The Virtual Teachers Centre also has useful information on using ICT in D&amp;T, together with a database of work that other teachers have shared."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
