Imagine how recent security changes are affecting aviation personnel. You don't need to be a regular viewer of Airport to know that commercial airport staff are accountable for all sorts of situations both within and without their control. Other than doctors and nurses, there are few people whose hands we put our lives in so readily. Travelling 30,000 feet in the air with nothing for company except an in-flight magazine, tensions run high. Balpa, which has over 9,000 of Britain's airline pilots in membership, wants safety recommendations from pilots to be taken much more seriously. Many pilots feel that the system is making their jobs more difficult rather than improving security. And, of course, with the recent increase in terrorist threat, a career in aviation might not be the first thing on the mind of the nation's graduates. But it's not all terrifying, says Kate North. \"Exciting, perhaps. Thankfully, confidence in the industry remains strong and it seems more people are flying than ever before. Obviously, there is increased security at UK airports but that is necessary for the safety and wellbeing of all passengers.\" North, from Cambridge, is a first officer with KLM. Her job involves flying from Amsterdam to various European destinations, checking flight planning and fuel measures. She has wanted to be a pilot since she was very young. \"I went on holiday with my family and was allowed a flight deck visit,\" she says. \"When I saw all the screens and dials I thought, 'Wow, I want to do that!'\" North won a flying scholarship with the Air Training Corps (Air Cadets) when she was 17 and used it to get her private pilot's licence. She then joined the RAF as a student navigator. While in the RAF, she passed ground exams required for an airline transport pilot's licence. She left the RAF when she won a sponsorship with civilian commercial flying school Cabair before joining KLM UK as a first officer on the Fokker 50. She says one of the best things about being a pilot is \"the feeling you get when it's pouring with rain and freezing cold on the ground, then when you go flying and pop up through the clouds and it's warm and sunny.\" She continues: \"Sometimes, you have to get up at 2.30am to get to work and if you're really unlucky you'll get that scheduled six days in a row. There are rules about how long you can work, but after 14 hours on day six ... It's exhausting.\" Training as a pilot can be a pretty pricey exercise. Costs vary but potential fliers need to have around \u00a360,000 in sponsorship or private wealth. Some airlines offer sponsorship, and some offer methods for borrowing and repaying this money that may be linked to starting salary. However, despite the cost of training, competition for training positions at flight schools is normally fierce. The RAF offers university and sixth form sponsorship for certain RAF careers, and you can receive up to \u00a34,000 a year as an undergraduate. From 2006, Brunel University is offering a BA and MA in aviation engineering and pilot studies. There are also several aviation schools such as Oxford Aviation Training, which offers full flight training as well as post-qualification selection preparation. Thirty-two-year-old Zoe Goldspink is a senior flight attendant for Virgin Airways. She trained for six weeks at the Horley Flight Centre near Gatwick, learning safety, security, customer service and medical training. It's a comprehensive training and entry requirements vary from airline to airline. None require a degree but some prefer a European language, most have minimum GCSE requirements and some like experience in a customer service role. Goldspink says the benefits are obvious. \"One minute you can be in New York and then the following week in Hong Kong or on a beach in Barbados. It does disrupt your social life and sometimes it can be a bit tiring, but there are far more pluses to the job. I love being cabin crew.\" She believes that since 9/11 there are more security measures in place and she doesn't feel personally threatened. \"There's passenger profiling, baggage screening at the airports, and preventative measures onboard like cockpit CCTV and strengthened cockpit doors. British airlines have a world-class security record and I know that the safety and security of the crew and passengers is always our priority.\" Goldspink says competition is tough to do her job but with \"determination to succeed, the right attitude and a big smile, then you will go a long way.\" And if you want to work in aviation, you don't have to be a strapping pilot or a pretty air hostess. Andrew Rae from Hampshire works for QinetiQ, a leading international defence and security technology company. He's the man responsible for the scary bits that pop up during take-off and landing, prompting you to grab the person next to you inappropriately. Rae did a degree in aeronautical engineering at Imperial College in London. \"The rest I've learned on the job,\" he says. His job involves using wind tunnels and other testing techniques, working on design and improvement of airliner parts, and providing solutions for customers in a consultancy role as well as approving aerodynamic flight clearance of test aircraft. Rae says: \"No two days are the same and the variety is something I'd be hard pushed to find anywhere else.\" The best thing about his job is the joy of coming up with something new. \"That's incredible,\" he says, \"both as an individual and as part of a team. Knowing that you've solved someone's problem is very rewarding, as is seeing something you designed on a plane in flight - a bit like an author seeing their book in a bookstore, or a musician hearing their work performed.\" For more information visit www.just4aviation.net www.oxfordaviation.net www.brunel.ac.uk www.virgin-atlantic.com www.klm.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
