Stoner was quickest on his Ducati Marlboro in 1min 55.286sec and will start today's floodlit race at the Losail circuit from the front row. He will be joined by Fiat Yamaha rider Rossi, who was second-quickest on 1:55.759 in qualifying to the man he took the MotoGP title from last season. Rossi finished just ahead of his team-mate, Jorge Lorenzo. Repsol Honda's Andrea Dovizioso was next, ahead of Rizla Suzuki's Loris Capirossi and the Monster Tech 3 Yamaha of Colin Edwards. Rookie Mika Kallio was 10th for Pramac Ducati, one place ahead of Marco Melandri, who was making his debut for the new Hayate team which took over after Kawasaki decided to pull out of MotoGP. Dani Pedrosa did well to set the 14th best time as he is still recovering from surgery but there was disappointment for former champion Nicky Hayden. Hayden is combining his 100th grand prix with his debut for Ducati Marlboro but finished outside the top 15 in qualifying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
