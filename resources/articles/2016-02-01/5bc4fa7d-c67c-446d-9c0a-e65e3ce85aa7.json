The Bowie tribute aside, it gave every impression of existing only to underline. You can\u2019t argue with the sales figures, but being repeatedly told what you already know is deathly dull. If you missed it, here\u2019s a review of each of the performers tonight \u2013 featuring \u201cfloor-humping\u201d, \u201ccoke-bloated chirpsing\u201d, \u201ca defibrillation paddle\u201d and a \u201cpublic grief bomb\u201d. Which makes the whole event sound much more exciting than it actually was. The Bowie band: who they were This was the illustrious lineup who played Life on Mars tonight: Mike Garson \u2013 keys (joined Bowie in 1972) Earl Slick \u2013 guitar (1974) Sterling Campbell \u2013 drums (1994) Gail Ann Dorsey \u2013 bass (1995) Gerry Leonard \u2013 guitar (2001) Catherine Russell \u2013 keys (2002) The final performance review of the night: BBT on Adele The problem with Adele\u2019s Grammy performance wasn\u2019t the twanging piano strings (negligible) or the tuning errors (minuscule), but rather her increasing tendency to project everything in a colourless, bleating cadence; where once she\u2019d denote emotional complexity with a sudden coo or breath, now she\u2019ll make some sassy hand gesture do the heavy lifting, like a young cousin losing an argument. Here she performs When We Were Young, which plays to her quivering low register and that lovely ruminative midrange, saving the (slightly hectoring) upper notes for the chorus. The peak top note isn\u2019t crystal; the squeaks and deliberate note-breaks could easily become mannered. But the guttural shove she gives the final chorus is pure soul, and ultimately this is big satisfying balladry, like custard and crumble. And at her best, she gives lyrical platitudes back their universal meaning. Nice modest performance from Adele, there. A backdrop glistening like a galaxy. Big vocals, and a big song with a big message: age, ageing, love, loss \u2013 a lifetime of emotions in four minutes. If you are reading this, Adele: I may have had a bottle of white wine, but I thought, maybe, on your tour, well, maybe I could come on stage for this performance and do an interpretive dance? Nothing fancy, just some gentle cartwheels and some star jumps. Might jazz it up a bit, that\u2019s all. Up to you, obvs. Anyway, that\u2019s it for the 2016 Brits. My verdict? Catfish frontman Van McCann missed his chance at becoming the next big gobby indie frontman. Adele did really well, as expected. And most importantly, Rihanna, Drake and Lorde seemed to steal the show, which is kind of depressing considering they\u2019re not Brits. And this is the Brit awards. Goes to Adele, our one last hope for hedonism and danger. However, someone appears to have given her some toast and Lucozade. Adele speech notes No 4: \u201cReally sorry about swearing earlier, and the ugly cry face.\u201d \u201cI think now would be the time to thank the people the fans.\u201d \u201cI wanted to thank everyone I worked with.\u201d \u201cAnd I also want to thank my boyfriend. This album was really hard to make and I think I was a nightmare sometimes. And this is all for my son.\u201d It\u2019s all gone a bit James Bay, who, just now, when asked what advice he would give to fellow Brits critics\u2019 choice winner Jack Garratt said: \u201cJust keep doing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d BBT v Abel Tesfaye! The wonderful Earned It turned the Weeknd from a pervert who induced Q4 jitters to a viable Michael Jackson stooge going out with Bella Hadid, and as such vies with Bieber for the international male career turnaround gong. He performs The Hills, which is textbook Weeknd: pitch-black, coke-bloated chirpsing drenched in distrust that leads, eventually, to dead-eyed sexual congress. The swear-bleep man cheerfully lets \u201cI only fuck you when it\u2019s half past five\u201d into ITV land, as the arrangement embraces the gnarliness with some ultra-heavy guitar and big smashed-glass visuals. It\u2019s short but energetic and edifying, exactly unlike the intercourse it sounds like he indulges in. Ben Beaumont-Thomas takes on the big performance of the night. Surely nothing will be worse than Lady Gaga\u2019s well-meaning but misjudged tribute at the Grammys, which was like Liza Minnelli trying to shout off a bout of sleep paralysis; cruise missiles and Kanye tweets have connected with more subtlety that the segues between its songs. It was basically Hallo Spaceboy! The David Bowie Musical Jamboree (Coming to Broadway Spring 2017), and only underlined how Bowie\u2019s star quality had been made truly ineffable with his death. What can the Brits offer? Well, there is certainly nothing more quintessentially Brits than the words: \u201cPlease welcome Annie Lennox!\u201d She pays testament to \u201ca fixation in the British psyche\u201d in a speech that straddles cliche and insight. The cut to Graham Coxon munching a canape takes the gloss off somewhat, but no matter, here\u2019s Gary Oldman to join the remembrance. He is predictably articulate, picking a choice quote from Bowie on his own music: a \u201csublime means of communication when I want to touch people; it has been both my doorway of perception and the house I live in.\u201d Whether you think this public grief bomb needed to be detonated, it\u2019s dignified. Clench for the music \u2026 and all is much better than the Grammys. Space Oddity begets Rebel Rebel begets Let\u2019s Dance \u2013 it\u2019s a megamix, but far more deftly handled (by Bowie\u2019s own band, no less) than Gaga\u2019s lurching. Lorde sings Life on Mars, and she can\u2019t capture Bowie\u2019s blend of music-hall singer and travelling bard \u2013 it\u2019s a little breathily earnest and pedantic. But there\u2019s still something sumptuous and soulful about her take, and again, it\u2019s dignified. Is \u201cdignified\u201d too safe for Bowie? Well, he was never a punk \u2013 honesty and keen feeling is just right. As voted for by the fans, so naturally, it\u2019s One Direction. Louis and Liam are here to collect the award. Just the two of them. One D are definitely still OK. Not going to split up after their hiatus. Definitely going to get back together and write more albums forever until we all die. \u2026 according to Twitter. Joined by Bowie\u2019s band, Lorde\u2019s interpretation is a touching, tasteful tribute An astronaut speaks! Here\u2019s Tim Peake\u2019s tribute to Adele. He\u2019s always banging on about music. He\u2019s only using the astronaut thing a shortcut to a record deal. After Annie Lennox\u2019s emotional speech, Gary Oldman has picked up the mic: \u201cWe are all coming to terms with the magnitude of David\u2019s passing,\u201d he says. \u201cDavid\u2019s contribution to popular culture itself has no equal, he\u2019s the very definition, the living embodiment of that word, icon.\u201d If anyone planned a stage invasion, now is probably not the best time. Goes to Bj\u00f6rk. It\u2019s her fourth win in this category. But she\u2019s not here. She\u2019s in space with Tim Peake, apparently. According to reports, she got on the spacecraft thinking it was a normal plane and now she\u2019s stuck out there for the next few years. Best of luck up there, Bj\u00f6rk. Here\u2019s a good video of Bj\u00f6rk picking up the same prize from the \u201990s: What did our Ben make of Little Mix, eh? Jason Derulo suitors Little Mix here, who, in between providing the Sun\u2019s Bizarre column with a stream of staggeringly unremarkable but at least regular content, make the occasional solid gold pop banger \u2013 of which Black Magic is undeniably one. It initially gets a exoticised voodoo-tribal update, which is swiftly dispensed for the chorus, which reverts to the perky fantasy-scribbled-on-A4-school-binder vibe of the original. There\u2019s lots of floor-humping a la Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s Survivor and equal amounts of Amazonian sass-power. Zero danger compared with Rihanna\u2019s enjoyably loose performance, but if you like absolute steel-tipped professionalism, you\u2019ll have clapped along delightedly. The voice of sanity Phillip Schofield, the man they call the Rebel, Pip the Damaja, Sweary Schoey \u2026 he\u2019s only gone and leapt to Adele\u2019s defence. Or global success award. Or whatever it\u2019s called. Before we get to Adele: Tim Peake\u2019s pretend suit. Did he pack this knowing he would give this award? Or just in case he felt fancy one day? For Valentine\u2019s Day? I wish I knew. If you could let me know, in a tweet, Tim, please do. Adele speech No 3: \u201cI can\u2019t work out if I am crying because of the video or because Tim Peake did it.\u201d Lots of swearing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I would ever come back, for you all to be so kind to me is so nice.\u201d Verdict: she is hammered. We are one drink away from full Pam-Hogg\u2019s-mate. Ben Beaumont-Thomas has been channelling his inner Barbadian dancehall queen. Last year I ruined an entire morning\u2019s work by repeatedly shouting \u201cYASS QUEEN\u201d at Rihanna, boobs hoisted to her hairline, doing Bitch Better Have My Money at the iHeartRadio awards show \u2013 the styling was Miss Saigon meets Rhythm Nation, and violent kleptocracies have been run with less scorn. Suffice to say my anticipation for this was high, and her missing the Grammys only heightened it. She performs Consideration as if through some partially open blinds in a strip club, segueing into Work for some heavily Bajan-accented gyration. She steamrolls its beautiful little \u201cNo one texts me in a crisis\u201d line, but this is an awards show, and subtlety will always be smothered; her laziness in the chorus lines is made up for by nailing the jazzy delivery of the verses. This is Rihanna at her most free and unimpeded by expectation, for better and worse. Drake comes out to apply a defibrillation paddle to the pair\u2019s by now rather stale sexual chemistry, but they gamely rut like a pair of Crufts champions who have disappointed their owners. Catfish and the Bottlemen! I saw Catfish at Glastonbury in 2015, when they had to cut their set short because they all had diarrhoea. Wait, was that a dream? No, according to NME, it did happen. Thank goodness for that. Thought I might be going totally mad for a second there. Anyway, more importantly, is indie is making a comeback? Write me a thinkpiece and I will not read it. Michael Hann\u2019s verdict: \u201cFor a great interviewee, he\u2019s a shit speech giver.\u201d Will it be better than when she performed from within a nu-rave pyramid with the Klaxons, though? Soak up that chemistry for a moment \u2013 she almost acknowledges at Simon at one point. Drake has arrived! His very presence has received the biggest cheer of the night. And he\u2019s wearing a tracksuit. An important question: Time for Trademark Hat to get the BBT assessment. Not since James Morrison has such a lovely voice been put to the service of such middling songs. But get your gravitational wave detectors out because the faintest of praise is incoming: Hold Back the River is his best, and its rousing gospel chorus cannot help but stir even the most Bay-resistant hack, even as it merely simulates religious-level feeling rather than actually living it. There\u2019s a gigantic cheer for his efforts, despite them being only 1% more impassioned than the recorded version. The hat meanwhile, surely the product of a worried major label styling meeting to try to inject some temporary pizazz, has become the hair of Samson, a mysterious totem whose power cannot be fully understood. It\u2019s a bit like the button in Lost \u2013 he dare not stop wearing it lest some catastrophe occur. Large parts of Clapham and Jack Wills warehouses might spontaneously collapse, perhaps. Is Justin Bieber! Picking up the prize, he said: \u201cThis shows life is a journey and everyone has their own journey and their ups and their downs.\u201d I really relate to this speech, thank you Justin. I\u2019ve abandoned several baby monkeys in European countries in the past few years. It means a lot to have your support. \u2018Internet issues\u2019 And performing Hold Back the River. When we interviewed James Bay in January, we asked him: what trait do you most deplore in yourself? His reply? \u201cI wish I was more spontaneous.\u201d MAKE YOUR WISHES COME TRUE, JAMES! FREESTYLE! SAY SOMETHING IMPORTANT! SCAT! AT LEAST TAKE THE HAT OFF! It\u2019s Coldplay! As presented to by earnest Hollywood actor and fashion model Simon Pegg. Coldplay have won this now for the fourth time. Beating the record they previously shared with Arctic Monkeys. Will Chris try and replicate Alex Turner\u2019s rallying call to arms from 2014? Only replacing \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d with \u201cbed wetting indie\u201d? Who am I trying to kid. I love Coldplay, I love Chris Martin. I am sobbing with pride. Adele\u2019s Hello. Speech notes No 2 (slightly more inebriated): \u201cI nearly fell over.\u201d \u201cI was not expecting this one at all.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s getting out of hand already, all the performers.\u201d Looks like Adele got most of her important bits out of the way in the first speech. I hope she wins more. I hope that by the end of the ceremony she\u2019s so hammered that she\u2019s wearing Pam Hogg\u2019s mate\u2019s outfit and James Bay\u2019s hat. Ben Beaumont-Thomas offers his two cents: Jess Glynne: you know her from Rather Be, Hold My Hand, and her blurred sexuality confusing the Daily Mail. Channelling equal parts Grace Coddington and Sideshow Bob with a megashock of red hair, she does a trio of Ain\u2019t Got Far To Go, Don\u2019t Be So Hard on Yourself, and Hold Your Hand, she rather overestimates the audience\u2019s knowledge of her lyrics, but the pipes are in good condition, and there\u2019s something endearingly big-eyed and butterfly-chasing about her decidedly 90s dancepop. A pleasant throwback to middleweight Brits female stars like Tina Cousins, Lisa Stansfield and Beverley Craven. Who needs dosed-up indie bands when you\u2019ve got Pam Hogg\u2019s mate, who just interrupted Ant and Dec\u2019s handover. Well done, Pam Hogg\u2019s mate. Tame Impala! Here\u2019s Kevin Parker. When we interviewed Kevin in July, he explained how he was off his face when he came up for the tripped-out concept for their third album, Currents. I was in LA a few years ago, and for some reason we\u2019d taken mushrooms. It must have been the end of our tour. I was coked up as well, and a friend was driving us around LA in this old sedan. He was playing the Bee Gees and it had the most profound emotional effect. I\u2019m getting butterflies just thinking about it. I was listening to Staying Alive, a song I\u2019ve heard all my life. At that moment it had this really emotive, melancholy feel to it. The beat felt overwhelmingly strong and, at that moment, it sounded pretty psychedelic. It moved me, and that\u2019s what I always want out of psych music. I want it to transport me. Is he off his face tonight? No. He\u2019s just thanked his record label and his management team and someone called Lisa. This was Bay\u2019s big moment. The world in the palm of his hands. \u201cThe really important stuff that I just have to say \u2026\u201d Bay began. Was it time for him to address the controversy surrounding racial inequality? Or perhaps something about Brexit? Maybe his view on controversial weedkiller Glyphosate? Not quite. He thanked: \u201cPaul and Ryan my managers\u201d \u201cMonty and Avery\u201d \u201cI would like to thank my family\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas felt mixed emotions while watching his beloved Justin. Justin Bieber, rising like a phoenix in a drop-arm vest, is proof that you can do anything when you\u2019re young and it doesn\u2019t matter: crash your car, neglect a monkey, think Eenie Meenie is a viable follow-up single. He\u2019s recording the best pop songs of the moment, bolstered with a redemption story, and if you\u2019re one of the few people who still thinks he\u2019s not a viable artist, pipe down and keep your stagnated personal growth to yourself. Unfortunately, tonight he\u2019s performing Love Yourself, which is a good line in search of a song, and it\u2019s compounded by the presence of James Bay, who is of use only for making a census of Britain\u2019s most basic people from his Facebook likes. But luckily this passes, and it\u2019s time for a bit of the beautiful Sorry around a campfire \u2013 in the ever-unfolding Bieber bildungsroman, this presumably represents the pyre of his old life, while the gyrating dancers acknowledge an undimmed libido. Probably. He saved the A-game tracks for the Grammys, then, but it\u2019s still probably better than most of the other performances this evening. James Bay. I suppose I should say something rude about his hat, but I\u2019m not going to. He\u2019s just joining a long lineage of musicians who have used hats to symbolise their creativity: Jamiroquai, Pharrell, Slash, Raury, errr this guy who comes up if you google the words \u201cMusicians and their weird hats\u201d. Let\u2019s call him Ewan. I don\u2019t want to panic you, but I found some rare footage of James completely nude, and by completely nude I mean he\u2019s not wearing his hat. When I say man, you say bun! Man-bun! Man-bun! A thought on Adele \u2026 Expressing her support for Kesha was what you would expect her to do. What\u2019s significant is that there are several tables\u2019 worth of executives from Sony \u2013 Kesha\u2019s record label \u2013 at the Brits. They\u2019ve have just been publicly upbraided by the world\u2019s biggest pop star. Adele\u2019s speech, in bullet points, because I did not take notes fast enough: \u201cOh my god, I\u2019ve got to try to not fall over\u201d \u201cTo all the other girls, thank you for being in my company. It\u2019s a privilege to be in your company\u201d \u201cThank you to my management for embracing me as a woman\u201d (or something like that) \u201cI\u2019d also like to take this moment to publicly support Kesha\u201d Adele! Here she is, the nation\u2019s sweetheart. It\u2019s no surprise that she\u2019s won. The singer famously sold 700BN copies of her album 25 in the first 10 minutes of its release in November 2015. If you\u2019ve been trapped in the same box as Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s one-off copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin for the last 12 months, why not reacquaint yourself with megastar Adele by reading Tom Lamont\u2019s excellent interview with her, in which she admitted: Some people I\u2019ve spoken to have said, \u2018You\u2019re going to sell at least half what you sold before.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s a given. You don\u2019t know. Not sure who this \u2018some people\u2019 is, but if you run the words \u2018some people\u2019 through an anagrammer it comes up with \u2018Lomes Pee Po\u2019. Lomes, if you\u2019re out there, gutted mate. All evening, the stalwart Ben Beaumont-Thomas is going to be reviewing every performance. And he\u2019s already got Coldplay under his belt. Coldplay wind music critics up with their sixth-form poetry, positive outlook and wealth, because we\u2019re all impoverished, jaded and our sixth-form poetry was the last time we truly felt anything apart from antipathy towards James Bay\u2019s hat. But actually, they\u2019re not so bad as all that. They perform Hymn for the Weekend, which is the one with Beyonc\u00e9 on, though she\u2019s not about to upstage them again \u2013 generous! Instead, their bald drummer sings her bit, and it doesn\u2019t scream \u201cfierce\u201d, but no matter. With their tales of getting drunk and high, along with photos of sunsets, and flower garlands draped everywhere, this is like going round to the house of a 21-year-old after they\u2019ve got back from their gap year: it\u2019s a bit naff, but you nod along fitfully and smile. Chris \u2018Christ\u2019 Martin here singlehandedly bringing back the double T-shirt look from 2002. Here\u2019s a picture of their rehearsal earlier. Mood: Terrified Beyonce might show up and steal the show. Fight! Here they are. Ant and Dec. Little fact about these two: Ant always stands on the left and Dec on the right. They call it the \u201c180-degree rule\u201d. It\u2019s not just part of their branding, either: rumour has it that if this rule is broken, both presenters immediately burst into flames. Here\u2019s an exclusive behind the scenes image from Guardian HQ. When asked to to describe their present mental state, members of the team replied: \u201cOK\u201d, \u201cjazzed\u201d and \u201cmy eyes are itchy.\u201d Maybe you guys in the comments section are a little more enthusiastic? Guys? Sell! Sell! Sell! A Justin Bieber fan account has tweeted a pic from the Brits merch stall, promising Bieber goodies. I can\u2019t see any evidence of that. But what I can see is that you can buy T-shirts with a cartoon of James Bay and his Trademark Hat. For \u00a325. (A tenner for the event programme, too.) But it\u2019s not just any cartoon of James Bay and his Trademark Hat \u2013 it\u2019s the official Brits emoji of James Bay and his Trademark Hat. Good God. An unlikely source for Brits stats \u2013 My Voucher Codes \u2013 has also sent us some interesting data on the event: Ethnicity: Since the awards began in 1977, only three black males (Seal, Finley Quaye and Dizzee Rascal) have won best British male solo artist. This means white, British males account for over 90% of the award wins in this award. In best female solo artist, the winners are more representative, but still underrepresented. Just under a quarter (24%) have been won by black women. Of the 36 winners in the group awards, Five Star\u2019s win in 1987 is the only time an all-black group have taken home the award. Going further, looking at individual members of bands, only Culture Club (winners in 1984), Fine Young Cannibals (winners in 1990) and Elbow (winners in 2009) have black members. This leads to an alarming 90% of the awards being won by all-white bands. While the days of salacious stage antics a la Jarvis Cocker\u2019s stage invasion are long gone, controversy still surrounds the award show. In the run up to tonight\u2019s show, discussion has been focused on the lack of diversity at this year\u2019s Brit awards. Read this essential pre-Brits piece by Yomi Adegoke about why this year\u2019s white nominees need to take a stand: In past years, white singers influenced by soul manage to clean up at the Brit awards and tend to then do the same several months later at the Mobos. The fact that many black musicians struggle to receive recognition at any ceremony at all doesn\u2019t seem to bother them one bit. By their own admission, many of these singers owe a great deal to the likes of Aretha Franklin, Etta James, James Brown and Whitney Houston \u2013 to the black pioneers of soul (hello Adele, Sam Smith), the blues (James Bay) and R&amp;B (Jack Garratt, Jessie J). Considering they\u2019re making music with black roots \u2013 and raking the money in by doing so \u2013 many show an unbelievable amount of contempt for the issues faced by those they emulate. In the past hour, Brit critics\u2019 choice winner Jack Garratt has also commented on the issue: It is a hugely important part of UK music, but it is a shame that half of UK music has been somehow forgotten about, which is a bit disappointing and a little bit embarrassing, to be honest I will be taking you through the Brits this evening. Tim Jonze, the Guardian\u2019s go-to digital guide for this annual extravaganza, sadly cannot be with us today. He is not dead. In fact, he\u2019s actually on his way to O2 arena as we speak. He\u2019s up for British male solo artist. Good luck, Tim! The show doesn\u2019t begin until 8pm GMT, so to fill time, let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and look back at 2015\u2019s event. Who could forget that night! Kanye brought the UK grime scene to the ceremony, Madonna\u2019s cape got caught in a plastic tusk, Ed Sheeran thanked album sales and his TV plugger Deirdre \u2026 Sam Smith got a pregnant woman to iron a Nazi flag on stage before urinating on the audience. No, wait, my mistake. That was Marilyn Manson. Well that\u2019s sort of it from Guardian fashion. Just to recap: Geri is the new Scary, Kylie is the new James Bay and Rihanna is the new Jubilee line. Over to Harriet and Michael on the music desk. Bye! Never one to unknowingly jump on every single trend like a rabid dog, Charli XCX is rocking spring/summer\u2019s slicked-back mullet hair and current season Vivienne Westwood. Cheryl has come as all the members of Girls Aloud rolled into one. Quite a feat! Probably not worth the effort, TBH. Beautiful Lana Del Rey is wearing a meadow. Sadly, we\u2019ve just heard that at the end of the night she will be retiring from music and taking root in a North Greenwich car park, by the bins. Which is sad. As ever, Mark Ronson is overjoyed to be on the Brits red carpet. But his jacket game \u2013 a dogstooth/sound-wave mashup (because he likes dogs and sounds) \u2013 is pretty strong. Well, we really didn\u2019t think Rihanna would make it. This is next level stuff. And she\u2019s avoided a tube mishap by coming as the new Elizabeth line. Props, Riri, props. There\u2019s a lot going on here: blond crop, mullet dress, underwear as outerwear. It\u2019s like an Ottolenghi recipe. We don\u2019t who these people are but we do know that they\u2019ve come as little bits of old sushi. Florence Welch has leapt fashion-forward by wearing a nightie and an eiderdown coat which is very next-season Alexander McQueen. HELLO, Adele. It\u2019s us. Can we talk about this dress? We\u2019re imagining your stylist\u2019s mood board features ruffles from the Prada SS16 catwalk and a box of livers. That said, we genuinely didn\u2019t think you were going to come so you crack on and best of luck. Marvin Humes has turned up sporting two on-point trends: a fetching Saint Laurent \u2018Yeah Baby\u2019 jacket and Drake\u2019s facial hair. 2016, we\u2019re back! Phew. Kylie\u2019s also looked to Burberry SS16 with her black lace prom dress. Inexplicably, she\u2019s nicked James Bay\u2019s hat. Little Mix have come as extras from the touring production of We Will Rock You on Ice. Bravo lads, bravo. Jack Garratt\u2019s bang on-trend in an emerald green double-breasted suit (very Burberry SS16). Of course, he\u2019s undone all his good work with his \u2018drunk uncle at a wedding\u2019 beard and hair combo. Oh, and the finger guns. Come on, mate :( S/O to Olly Murs and Craig David who both look decent (fashion fact-finders: navy suits and trainers are a fairly reliable red carpet trend in menswear). Also big fans of David\u2019s pocket hankerchief, although rumour has it, it\u2019s seven feet long and if you pull it all the way out, the original members of Artful Dodger are attached at the end. You\u2019re welcome! Question: do you think if James Bay\u2019s hat met Matt Cardle\u2019s cap they\u2019d get on? Or, say, be more charismatic than their owners? Asking for a friend. OMG, ELTON\u2019S HERE! Just messing. It\u2019s Muswell Hill\u2019s very own Jess Glynne. It feels fitting to start with Geri Halliwell. It is 2016 after all. In 1997 she wowed the Brits with her union jack dress. Almost 20 years later, she\u2019s channelling Scary Spice\u2019s leopard print fetish. #thecircleoflife We\u2019ll be rating and potentially slating all the best (and worst) looks from the red carpet of this year\u2019s Brit Awards. So without further ado \u2026 Hello! It\u2019s Priya and Morwenna here from the Guardian fashion desk *does Blue Steel face*. Hello, good evening, and welcome! It\u2019s Michael Hann here. In a few minutes, our fashionable colleagues Morwenna Ferrier and Priya Elan will be joining us to cast their trained eyes over the red carpet outfits (we\u2019ve dressed up in Guardian towers, too: I\u2019m is sporting a vintage \u2013 2012 \u2013 John Lewis blue merino jumper with a moth hole in the left arm, along with a gingham shirt that has a fashionably threadbare collar). Before that happens, let us ponder what the Brits are all about. And for that, I turn to a press release sent over yesterday.

But aren\u2019t you happy knowing that SPA treatments are available? Now you want to know about the food being served to the guests, don\u2019t you? Here you go \u2026 A sumptuous three-course dinner will be prepared by a team of 60 chefs: Starter: roasted Isle of Wight tomato mousse with Scottish forest mushrooms and shaved truffle Main: Lake District trio of lamb, including roast best end, pressed salt baked belly and slow cooked rolled shoulder, served with Lincolnshire butternut puree, Berkswell ewe\u2019s cheese, lamb jus and marsh herbs.
