Just like we love the idea that whichever generation we belong to invented sex, we love the idea that it was all Vera Lynn, tea dances and Purcell recitals until Elvis grinded, Little Richard screamed and the Beatles invented songwriting. The great thing about Rakehell's Revels, a 21-track compilation of swing classics dating from Chick Webb's 1925 'T'Aint What You Do' starring the young Ella Fitzgerald, to Louis Jordan fusing blues, mambo, calypso and anti-cop protest on 1956's 'Run Joe', is that the wild, erotic and timeless thrill of the music cuts right through the nostalgic exercise it could have been, and puts the sheer sexlessness of much modern pop into perspective. Whatever you do, don't put on that Fratellis/Akon/KT Tunstall record on after you've immersed yourself in the virtuoso metaphorical rudeness of 'Walking Stick' by Louis Armstrong and the Mills Brothers - recorded in 1926! - or you might just be forced to do the right thing, chuck out your collection and start again with the African-American art that was the 20th century's greatest gift to civilisation. The Rakehell's Revels itself is a weekly Tuesday night club held in the opulent Grill Room at London's historic Cafe Royal. While admission price is just a fiver, you won't get in unless dressed to the nines in pre-rock chic, and revellers willing to indulge in a bit of flapper and Fred Astaire style have thus far included Keira Knightley, the White Stripes, Scarlett Johannson, Bjork and Jude Law. Promoters David Piper and Wade Crescent's current wheeze is hiring themselves out as 'cadograms'... the idea being that a perfectly sane woman pays \u00a3500 for a night of being rakishly charmed and 'left sorely disappointed'. As most British women can get that experience from a man for the price of a Bacardi Breezer, I suspect that this may not be business idea of the year. No matter, though, because this compilation makes Piper and Crescent's club sound like a night in heaven. Wonder at just how spooky and sexy a clarinet can be with Artie Shaw's 'Nightmare'. Be stunned at Django Reinhardt inventing gypsy jazz and 'angular' post-punk guitar on 1934's 'Charleston'. Ponder the historical falsehood about country being anti-miscegenation on the definitive western swing of Bob Wills. Rakehill's Revels simply features some of the greatest and most influential music ever made... The Cotton Club in your living room."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
