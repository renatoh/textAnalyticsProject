A polite email nudging the then 26-year-old Irish teacher and disability advocate for her RSVP did the trick, leaving Burke with two dilemmas: \u201cFirst, what would I say, and second, what would I wear?\u201d Burke \u2013 who had a fashion industry-focused blog called Minnie M\u00e9lange \u2013 is a little person, the term she favours when referencing her achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, that means she has shorter-than-average limbs. Desirable frocks and footwear are hard to come by, she says, when you\u2019re 3ft 5in and \u201ca size 12 in the children\u2019s shoe department.\u201d As a clothes-obsessed teenager, shopping with her four younger siblings \u2013 all of whom are \u201caverage height\u201d \u2013 was tantalising and demoralising by turns. \u201cI understood that one of the functions of fashion is to symbolise maturity, yet it wasn\u2019t something I could participate in,\u201d she says. Rails were beyond reach; clothes needed tailoring. The curvature of Burke\u2019s spine means \u201cthe back of a skirt or a dress needs to be 2in longer in order to sit evenly.\u201d With the White House engagement approaching, Burke mentioned on Twitter that she was seeking a small dress for a big do. Producer Moya Doherty saw the tweet, and arranged for a beautiful gown to be made in the costume department of Riverdance \u2013 a fact Burke says amused her no end when it came to the perennial American red carpet question \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d On the same trip, she delivered an impromptu speech at an event in New York that caught the attention of a scout for TED conferences. Burke\u2019s ensuing TED Talk, Why Design Should Include Everyone, has been viewed more than 1.5m times. Burke recently published Break the Mould, the children\u2019s book she wrote in lockdown. It\u2019s four years since that fateful US trip, and she still has the White House M&amp;Ms in her fridge. In terms of occasion wear, her observation that she has \u201coptions\u201d these days is putting it mildly. Her trajectory from part-time fashion blogger to globetrotting style maven and cross-platform icon of inclusivity has garnered a wardrobe of bespoke looks by the likes of Dior and Prada. Encountering Burke has also been a transformative experience for the fashion powerhouses she is wont to gladhand \u2013 something she does with the practised self-possession of one who (as she explained in her Ted Talk) has to enlist a stranger to stand guard every time she uses a public bathroom cubicle. When she launched her podcast As Me with Sin\u00e9ad, Victoria Beckham was the inaugural interviewee. Having met Burke front row at Burberry, British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful appointed her as contributing editor, advising on \u201cfashion through a disability lens\u201d. An encounter with Marco Bizzarri, head of the $10bn Gucci group, led to an ongoing association that saw Burke walking the pink stairs of last year\u2019s Met Gala in a custom bow-embellished velvet dress from Gucci\u2019s Cruise collection. This made her the first little person in history to attend the fashion world\u2019s equivalent of the Oscars. Beforehand, she led Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Anna Wintour in an accessibility audit of the venue, but was so \u201cviolently unwell\u201d with nerves she can\u2019t remember whether Wintour removed her trademark shades. A glamorous footstool matched to the gala\u2019s furniture helped Burke hobnob unaided with the likes of Harry Styles and Serena Williams, and she ended the night dancing with Katy Perry around the immersive Moschino hamburger from which the pop star had emerged. Burke\u2019s dress now hangs in the Gucci Garden museum in Florence, alongside other landmark outfits from the house\u2019s history. Perfect material, you\u2019d think, for a frothy fashion fairytale. But with her book, Burke has created something substantial. Subtitled How To Take Your Place in the World, it\u2019s a zero-hocus instruction manual for successful self-actualisation that its author hopes will encourage young readers \u201cto understand that they are enough as they are, and the responsibility we each have to make the world a more equitable and accessible place\u201d. The president of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, has deemed it \u201cvery important\u201d. Burke sits on Higgins\u2019s Council of State, which, she explains to junior readers, is \u201ca group of people he calls on whenever there is a big decision to be made\u201d. Talking from her parents\u2019 house in Navan, County Meath \u2013 her brother and sisters (three of whom are optometrists) have left her in charge of the family Jack Russell, Cookie, and a stream of internet purchases which sees her occasionally heading for the door \u2013 Burke is superb company, even over Zoom. Her eyes widen with campy astonishment as we exchange fashion industry anecdotes, and she\u2019s affably sarcastic. \u201cObviously what the world needs is another white woman with a Netflix special,\u201d is her reply when asked about broadcasting prospects. The book starts with Burke\u2019s journey to becoming a teacher, an ambition she articulated on her first day of school. She marched to the front of the class, explained achondroplasia and spelled it for her classmates. Because she has \u201cthe privilege of being a loved child\u201d and because Burke\u2019s father, Chris, is a fulfilled fellow little person, she says it never occurred to her that she wasn\u2019t capable of achieving her goals. It was always a case \u201cof finding new ways in\u201d. Aged 11, she decided against limb-lengthening surgery, a decision she examines in the book. On one side of the page she enumerates the pros of undergoing the procedure: the avoidance of playground jibes, the ability to reach light switches, not needing a head start in the egg-and-spoon race and so on. There\u2019s just one entry in the other column, but it\u2019s a powerful one, rendered in beam-emitting capitals: \u201cBEING ME.\u201d That the Irish dictionary even contains an equivalent term for little person \u2013 duine beag \u2013 is down to Burke, who contacted Foras na Gaeilge, the organisation for Gaelic linguistic development, after the discomfiting experience of having to describe herself as \u201ca dwarf\u201d during her teacher training exams. \u201cIn just three days, I had changed the language,\u201d she writes, before informing readers that, since language is always in flux, they, too, \u201chave the power to make a difference and teach your friends and family new, kinder words.\u201d Burke\u2019s father Chris and her average-height mother Kath, founded Little People of Ireland in 1998, an organisation, which Burke says, \u201crecognises that questions of identity go much further than the person who is primarily affected\u201d. As a teacher, she engaged her 11 and 12-year-old charges by being forthright about her experiences and rearranging the classroom furniture so she could address them at eye level, which \u201ctransformed the power dynamic\u201d. Throughout her own formative years she keenly felt the absence of media representation for little people outside of the denizens of Hogwarts or Westeros, most of whom were male, not to mention imaginary. \u201cI am almost 30 and I have never been to a library or a bookshop and picked up a book with someone like me on the cover,\u201d she tells me. Interspersed throughout her book are stories of change-makers from the deaf sound-drawing artist Christine Sun Kim to New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, whom Burke met and befriended at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 2019, where she led four speaking sessions. \u201cCasual!\u201d she says when it\u2019s brought up. The resources section at the back of Breaking the Mould refers readers to organisations including Black Lives Matter and Mermaids, the support centre for transgender youth. In one chapter, a giant speech bubble proclaims: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be gay.\u201d \u201cI would never want to speak on behalf of groups that I am not a member of,\u201d she says, \u201cbut being able to write a book is such a privilege and I wrote it for anyone who has, for any reason, felt like an \u2018other\u2019 in their life.\u201d In the summer of 2019, Burke was in Malta on holiday with her family when Vogue emailed to ask if she could take an important call from Enninful. Accustomed to their over-achieving eldest sister\u2019s reluctance to switch off, her siblings were unimpressed when she marched them into a branch of McDonald\u2019s in search of wifi. She was talking Enninful through the finer points of her Big Mac (\u201cextra pickles, extra cheese\u201d) when, to her astonishment, he introduced Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who duly invited Burke to appear on the cover of the magazine\u2019s \u201cForces for Change\u201d issue, which the royal was guest editing. \u201cWhen I said, \u2018Hello Duchess,\u2019 I think my family realised it was probably a good choice to take the call,\u201d she says. Burke rises at 6am. \u201cThe first thing I do is read the Financial Times, Women\u2019s Wear Daily, Business of Fashion and Vogue Business,\u201d she says. She\u2019s always thinking, she says, of the images not being published, the voices and perspectives which are absent. When New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman wrote a piece describing disability as fashion\u2019s final frontier, but including no conversations with disabled people, Burke sent her an email and the two became friends. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being controversial for the sake of it, but it\u2019s not about being passive, either,\u201d she says of her newfound \u201cinsider-outsider\u201d status. The combined spending power of the disabled market, Burke likes to point out, is as big as China\u2019s, yet it is chronically underserved by the fashion industry. \u201cKnowing that, my goal was never to create a line of clothing that I could wear,\u201d she says. \u201cRather, it was to change the entire system \u2013 which tells you everything you need to know about my personality, really.\u201d Burke was born in 1990, the year Mary Robinson took office as president and declared, \u201cI was elected by the women of Ireland who instead of rocking the cradle, rocked the system.\u201d She feels fortunate to belong to a post-Troubles generation that has seen unprecedented societal change, notably in the form of the legalisation of gay marriage in 2015 and the liberalisation of abortion law in 2018. \u201cIreland has changed so much, and that\u2019s partly due to the influx of technology companies,\u201d she says. \u201cBut ultimately I think the change comes down to the bravery of ordinary people who chose to have difficult conversations around dining tables. What really brought about marriage equality and women\u2019s bodily autonomy was families talking about their children wanting to get married. It was women confiding in their families, saying, \u2018When I was 16, I needed or wanted an abortion.\u2019\u201d Still, she says, there remains \u201cmuch more work to do for Ireland to become a truly inclusive society\u201d. Burke is straight, but feels kinship with the LGBTQ+ community in Dublin and is an Alternative Miss Ireland emeritus \u2013 a title typically awarded to a drag performer. Having endured ridicule, intimidation and sexual harassment in mainstream clubs (a man once unzipped his fly in her face for the amusement of his mates), she remembers dancing uninhibitedly for the first time at the George, Dublin\u2019s most famous gay venue, during her student days. The track was Madonna\u2019s Vogue. \u201cI was moved by the fact I wasn\u2019t being observed by anybody, because within that club, most people were different or had a visceral understanding of how it feels to be made to feel different in a way that was not positive,\u201d she says. Distant family members attending her 21st birthday were perplexed by the predominance of drag queens doing the Macarena. \u201cSome of them were like, is this the act?\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad was like, no, these are Sin\u00e9ad\u2019s friends.\u201d It\u2019s not unreasonable to think she might harbour political aspirations beyond her Council of State role. She\u2019s got the Rolodex for it and you can be president of Ireland at 35 \u2013 leaving a few years to get her immaculately dressed ducks in a row. \u201cTo be honest, I often ask myself \u2013 as many activists and advocates do \u2013 whether I can have a greater impact working outside of that system or within it,\u201d she says. She would struggle with the question of \u201cwhich political party would you align yourself with \u2013 which best fits your moral compass and your political beliefs\u201d and whether to do so would be limiting. She\u2019s wary, too, of the lurching vicissitudes of life in the public eye and the \u201cswinging pendulum\u201d of social media approval, \u201cwhich rarely finds equilibrium\u201d. In other words, a faultless politician\u2019s response. For now, though, she says, \u201cI\u2019m comfortable where I am, but I\u2019m looking forward to leaning into the space I need to take up.\u201d Break the Mould by Sin\u00e9ad Burke is out now (Wren &amp; Rook, \u00a38.99).
