Responding to reports of the payment, Huang said on social media: \u201ctruth is what\u2019s overdue. Calling all investigatory powers to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible\u2026 where did that A$11mn payment in Bakehouse Quarter deal go?\u201d Seph Glew, the founder of Kirela, the property trust that sold Huang the Bakehouse Quarter development in Sydney\u2019s inner west, told the Guardian the payment to Chalabian was an \u201cintroduction fee\u201d, paid as part of a deal that was brought to him by a real estate agent in mid-2017. Glew said Huang\u2019s Yuhu group agreed to pay a non-refundable fee of $38m to Kirela for an option to buy Bakehouse Quarter, of which $11m was to be paid to Chalabian. \u201cWe interacted with Sevag Chalabian and we agreed a fee and paid the fee where directed,\u201d he said. But a spokeswoman for Huang said the businessman \u201cwas not aware of the payment split issue referred to\u201d. \u201cThe lawyer featured was not the purchaser\u2019s solicitor,\u201d she said. The Guardian understands Huang\u2019s position is that he paid $38m to Kirela but had no knowledge of where, or to whom, the money was then directed. The Australian Financial Review has reported that Kirela paid the money into the bank account of a company controlled by Chalabian\u2019s mother, but Glew said he was unaware of this. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Sevag\u2019s mother comes into it, that\u2019s not something I would investigate,\u201d he said. Chalabian, a former property lawyer, held interests for the corrupt Obeid family, and currently faces charges of conspiracy to defraud nearly $25m paid to his former law firm, as part of a blackmail operation connected to a tax office fraud case. Controversy over the purchase by Huang\u2019s property group, Yuhu, of the development, a commercial and retail hub in a former Arnott\u2019s biscuit factory, comes amid continuing uncertainty over the status of what was once his flagship project, the luxury One Circular Quay tower on prime Sydney land overlooking the harbour. The proposed twin-tower apartment and hotel development, housing more than 300 luxury apartments, remains a scar in the ground at present, with no builder appointed, and none likely for months. Huang is exiled from Australia and is understood to be living in Hong Kong after his permanent residency was torn up by the Morrison government, on advice from security agencies over character concerns. His application for citizenship was withdrawn. The Australian Taxation Office obtained a freezing order over his Australian assets in September, after telling the federal court he owed $140m in tax. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Glew told the Guardian he has never met Huang. He said Bakehouse Quarter was not on the market in early 2017, when he was \u201cpersistently\u201d approached by real estate agent Ben Kirby, of Ray White Commercial, to sell the property. \u201cI would have had 20 phone calls from him around early 2017 saying, \u2018Come on mate, we\u2019ve got a real buyer\u2019,\u201d he said. Glew said the agents then brought Chalabian to a meeting with him. \u201cEffectively you might say that the agents introduced us to Sevag and he proposed a fee for introducing a buyer.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like we met Yuhu first and then he came along later. \u201cIt\u2019s a far from unique event\u2026 it\u2019s pretty normal.\u201d However, he said the transaction did have one unusual aspect: the delivery of a cheque for $38m along with an unsigned agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty unusual, an unsigned draft document that nobody\u2019s read plus a cheque arriving on your desk, but that probably says more about our state of mind than theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point we were reluctant sellers so they were showing their bona fides by lobbing up a cheque with no conditions on it.\u201d He said he banked the cheque and paid Chalabian his fee. Chalabian and Kirby have been contacted for comment. Yuhu originally agreed to pay $420m for Bakehouse Quarter, but after a series of option extensions \u2013 for which Yuhu paid Kirela additional millions \u2013 the sale finally settled in April this year for $380m. Huang had been a prominent Sydney property developer and political donor \u2013 regularly photographed with prime ministers and key politicians \u2013 before his permanent residency was rescinded in 2018. In 2015, political parties had been warned not to take money from Huang \u2013 a prolific political donor, giving more than $2.7m since 2012 to both sides of politics \u2013 out of concern he was seeking to influence Australian politics on behalf of the Chinese Communist party. Huang\u2019s links to Labor\u2019s Sam Dastyari \u2013 who took money from Huang for personal expenses and was exposed tipping off Huang that his phone was tapped \u2013 ultimately cost the senator his parliamentary career. Huang has also emerged as a central figure in hearings before Icac. It\u2019s alleged he gave an illegal $100,000 donation in cash \u2013 carried in an Aldi shopping bag \u2013 to the NSW Labor party in 2015, and paid $30,000 to the then party general secretary Jamie Clements to pay legal fees. And Huang remains locked in a dispute with the Australian Taxation Office, which is chasing him for $140m in unpaid tax, interest and penalties. The tax office has successfully won an order freezing all of his assets worldwide, arguing the reclusive billionaire does not have enough assets in Australia to pay the bill, and has been pulling tens of millions in assets out of the country since he was exiled. The ATO may seek to bankrupt Huang in Australia in order to retrieve the unpaid amount, the federal court has heard. Huang is fighting the ATO\u2019s claim, and, in a swingeing but vague attack, called the tax office a \u201cdespicable tool for political persecution\u201d, saying \u201cunknown dark forces\u201d and an Australian \u201cdeep state\u201d were conspiring against him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
