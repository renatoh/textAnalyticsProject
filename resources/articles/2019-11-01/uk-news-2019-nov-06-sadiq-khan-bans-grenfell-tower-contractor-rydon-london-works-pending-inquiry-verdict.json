The move emerged on Wednesday after the government angered survivors by including Rydon Construction Ltd (RCL) on a list of 12 companies suitable for carrying out works on public high-rise housing in the south of England. The Cabinet Office said it had no choice but to include Rydon under EU rules and was abiding by UK law, but the bereaved and survivors accused ministers of \u201chiding behind red tape\u201d after Khan\u2019s decision. The Labour mayor signed an order in 2018 asserting it was not in the public interest to allow the company to bid for works until the public inquiry into the disaster \u201chas reported on the extent to which any Rydon group companies or employee contributed to causing or exacerbating the Grenfell Tower fire\u201d. Rydon qualified to be one of 30 companies recommended to build residential-led developments, but Khan quietly suspended it from the list, according to documents seen by the Guardian. City Hall appears to have been willing to take a risk that its decision would be challenged by Rydon, because, in common with central government, it is bound by EU procurement rules. Rydon was the main contractor on the \u00a310m Grenfell refurbishment, which wrapped the tower in combustible cladding. A public inquiry concluded last week that this was the main cause of the spread of the fire. It also found the works were in breach of building regulations. The company is among construction businesses facing intense scrutiny during the second phase of the public inquiry into the lead-up to the disaster, which will begin 18 months of hearings in late January. The Metropolitan police are also running a complex criminal investigation into the construction, refurbishment and management of the tower, and the emergency response. The Met is investigating corporate manslaughter, individual gross negligence manslaughter and health and safety offences. In 2018, Rydon reported a \u00a316.6m post-tax profit, more than double the previous year, when the Grenfell disaster happened. Grenfell United, which represents survivors and bereaved families, said: \u201cThe government needs to stop hiding behind red tape, apply common sense and take Rydon off this list. \u201cIf the mayor can do it to keep Londoners safe, the prime minister should do it for the rest of the country. Rydon should not be allowed to work on high-rise blocks until the investigations into how the refurbishment of Grenfell went so badly wrong is complete.\u201d A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cBeing on a framework does not guarantee a company will secure government contracts and does not constitute an endorsement of them. Under existing EU rules, we are not legally allowed to preclude Rydon Construction from bidding for government contracts.\u201d A spokesperson for the mayor said: \u201cThe GLA [Greater London Authority] considers that it is in the public interest not to allow RCL to bid for contracts under its panel until the Grenfell Tower inquiry has reported on the extent to which any Rydon group companies or employee contributed to causing or exacerbating the Grenfell Tower fire.\u201d Rydon declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
