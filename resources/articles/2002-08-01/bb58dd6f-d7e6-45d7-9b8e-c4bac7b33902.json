The 51-year-old victim, named as David Caldwell, suffered multiple injuries after picking up a lunchbox-type device in a temporary building at the Territorial Army's Caw Camp in Derry, Co Londonderry. He was taken to Altnagelvin hospital but died a short time later. As police sealed off the area and launched an investigation, security sources blamed dissident terrorists opposed to the peace process for the bomb. One said: \"It's far and away most likely to be the dissidents.\" The source added: \"It's likely this was some form of anti-handling device, probably activated by a mercury tilt switch they have used in the past. Once you move it the bomb activates.\" The dead man is understood to have been a former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment who lived in the village of Eglinton, six miles outside Derry. The dead man's partner, Mavis McFaul, said his family were devastated and appealed for no retaliation for Mr Caldwell's death.\"I want no revenge for Davy's death because he wouldn't want it. I have a daughter and if they could see the families they leave behind, the heartbroken, they wouldn't do this,\" she added. He had just arrived for work in the barracks which was undergoing refurbishments. The base is used mainly by ambulance and other medical units within the TA and is also used by army cadets aged from 13 to 17. An army spokesman denounced it as a \"despicable, cowardly attack\". He added: \"This is a centre for medical units which provide TA personnel for peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks all over the world. These people are lifesavers and it's outrageous that such an incident should occur in such a place.\" The Northern Ireland secretary, John Reid, hit out at the terrorists' bid to wreck the peace process. \"This murder is utterly contemptible,\" he said. \"Dissident republican bombers and loyalist murder gangs are two sides of the same coin. None of us in Northern Ireland can afford to let them succeed.\" The bomb is the latest in a series of attacks on army bases in and around Co Londonderry. Within the last two years dissidents have been blamed for explosions at Ebrington, Magilligan and Ballykelly barracks. Gregory Campbell, the hardline Democratic Unionist MP for the area, claimed the prime minister, Tony Blair, could no longer argue the peace process was working. The staunch opponent of the Good Friday agreement said: \"Two days ago I was sitting in Downing Street and when we outlined the worsening situation he expressed surprise and almost disbelief. Now, 48 hours later, we couldn't have a more tangible evidence that things aren't working. The government has to stop living the lie.\" Sinn Fein MLA Mary Nelis voiced total opposition to the bomb and urged those behind the attack to halt their campaign. She said: \"They have little or no support and operate without a strategy to achieve political change.\" As fears grew that loyalist paramilitaries may strike back, senior Ulster Unionist Sir Reg Empey appealed for calm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
