Friday's goalless draw with Italy at Windsor Park maintained Northern Ireland's encouraging start to Group C and they will move level with Cesare Prandelli's leaders with victory in Torshavn. The Faroes remain international cannon fodder, conceding 15 goals in their four outings so far, but Worthington is anxious to guard against any over-confidence in his ranks. \"I would love us to stuff the Faroes 1-0. It will not be easy,\" said the Northern Ireland manager. \"I didn't want to say it before we played Italy but I see Tuesday as the more difficult game. Brian Kerr [the manager of the Faroe Islands] knows all about our players and our style and they will get men behind the ball. The expectation is staring us in the face on Tuesday and if you are not focused 100% in football then you are going to get a little slap. My job is to make sure that doesn't happen and to make sure we do an ultra-professional job.\" Worthington accepts Friday's draw and the away win in Slovenia represent a \"very good start\" towards qualification for Poland and Ukraine, and believes his side can improve on the Italy performance. He added: \"We've had two clean sheets, an excellent all-round performance in Slovenia and while we didn't pass the ball as well as we can do against Italy, and maybe there was a nervousness against the ex-World champions, you could not fault our focus or shape.\" David Healy's established position in the starting line-up is under threat against the Faroe Islands after his barren spell extended to 14 international games against Italy. A lack of first-team football at Sunderland betrayed Northern Ireland's leading goalscorer on Friday and, with Kyle Lafferty impressing as a substitute, Worthington does have the option to change. The manager said: \"I am not saying David will start every game but I will support him during his lean spell in front of goal. If I have to freshen things up then it will be done. Kyle was focused and did a good job when he came on. That is the Kyle Lafferty I like, a proper player, and he has put himself in a strong position to start. But David has scored a huge amount of goals for Northern Ireland and I don't think we can just disregard a player who has done so well for us in the past. We don't have the amount of players for that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
