With the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie against Barcelona to come on Tuesday, after Sunday\u2019s crucial victory over Leicester City in the Premier League, Wenger has been preparing his players for Saturday\u2019s fifth-round tie at home to Hull City. It will be the third meeting in the competition with Steve Bruce\u2019s team in as many seasons, after the dramatic 3-2 win over them in the 2014 final and the more straightforward 2-0 passage in the third round at Emirates Stadium last season. The Wembley showpiece with Hull will always stir the emotions inside Wenger and he suggested that he might have quit Arsenal had they lost rather than fought back from 2-0 down to win in extra-time. The Frenchman has not won the Premier League title since 2004 but the 2-1 victory over Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side means his team have a good chance to do so this season and, moreover, they have routinely competed in the top four. Over Wenger\u2019s 19 and a half years at Arsenal, only United have stayed the course as regular contenders but even they have slipped since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement in 2013, with a seventh-placed finish under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal currently struggling to lift them above fifth. \u201cWhen you look at our consistency, we are the only one club who, for such a long time, has always been at the top,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIt looks easy as long as it happens but maybe you will see one day that it is not as easy as it looks to keep that consistency going over the years. It\u2019s very difficult. It demands very hard commitment and work.\u201d Wenger was asked whether United\u2019s woes, which deepened after Thursday night\u2019s insipid 2-1 Europa League defeat at FC Midtjylland, had placed a stronger emphasis on Arsenal\u2019s longevity. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to speak about other clubs,\u201d he replied. \u201cConsistency, for me, is the most difficult thing to achieve for a club. Once it is there, everybody considers it as normal. It is taken for granted.\u201d Wenger has 17 months to run on his Arsenal contract and he always honours them. There is a school of thought that fans will miss him only when he has gone. That moment almost came after the FA Cup final against Hull. After nine years without a trophy, Wenger was under immense pressure to win and the backdrop to the game was the fact that he had not renewed his contract, which was set to expire that summer. \u201cIf we had lost it, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Wenger said, with regard to whether he would have signed the new deal that was on offer. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know. It would have been a problem had we not won, because it would have been a massive disappointment for everybody. But we won. \u201cIn the modern job, you have always to explain about what you do not achieve. What you achieve is always known but you have always to explain why you do not win this, why did you not win that. Of course, it would have been a problem.\u201d Victory, though, was a turning point. Wenger signed his new contract, albeit 13 days after the final, when it was impossible not to detect a bout of soul-searching, and the team have since looked more secure. \u201cIt was so important because we had not won trophies and people wanted trophies,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIf you go to a final against Manchester United, people think you can win or lose. If you go to a final against Hull, everybody expects you absolutely to win and the disappointment would have been bigger. \u201cI never forget the decisive moments in the game, like Gibbs\u2019s header off the line at 2-0 down and Cazorla\u2019s free-kick for 2-1. When he took that free-kick, I thought maybe it was a bit too far for him but he scored. At 2-0, it was close to 3-0 and we were nervous. The pressure that was on us created a nervy, insecure start and Hull had nothing to lose. \u201cI don\u2019t know [if it would have been difficult to carry on]. I\u2019m committed to this club and I\u2019ve shown that. One day, I will show you all the proposals that I denied to stay here. On my side, it was always very clear. I am committed to do well. If I don\u2019t do well enough, the club, I hope, will one day tell me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
