In vain did I plead pressure of work and multiplying deadlines as the fateful day approached. \"You said you were coming and you're coming,\" she said. \"Your auntie Eileen's already changed the bed.\" We set off at first light. My mother never sleeps the night before a trip \"home\", just stands unblinkingly by the bay window like a suburban Terminator, scanning the sky for dawn. When we were little, she used to dress us while we slept and chuck us in the back of the car when she couldn't stand the wait any more. Having broken the sound barrier somewhere before Sandbach, we used to arrive before Grandma had gone to bed the night before. Now we stipulate a 7am reveille, so that we're not the only people wandering Fleetwood with jet lag. Dad waves us off with tears of anything but sadness in his eyes. \"Give over,\" Mum says as I fling myself against the car window with cries of despair until we turn the corner and he vanishes from view, \"and enter our time of departure in the logbook.\" \"08.00.07,\" I duly note. \"Delay due to daughter's insistence on wearing buckled shoes \u2013 only slip-ons had been anticipated by the Captain.\" \"And why have you got your bag on your knees? Put it down on the floor.\" I refuse. I'm hoping to get DVT by Reading. As we head round the M25 towards the M1, she tells me she withdrew \u00a3300 in preparation for the trip. \"Why?\" I said. \"Are you buying a house?\" \"No,\" she says. \"I got \u00a3150 out, but they were all lovely new notes and I didn't want to use them. So I went back and got another lot. Stop scrabbling at the door like that. You can't get out anyway \u2013 it's child-locked.\" \"I didn't think front-seat doors were ever child-lockable.\" \"Mine are,\" she says, \"I thought you might get restless, so I took the panel off yesterday and made some adjustments. You're going nowhere.\" An hour later I am forced to recognise a terrible truth. \"Mum?\" I say hesitantly. \"What?\" \"I know we've been driving for only an hour...\" \"Yes?\" \"And I know we're already running seven seconds late because of my shoes...\" \"Yes?\" \"But I really, really need a wee.\" \"I don't stop,\" she says, stating something that within the family has long taken on the status of an eternal verity. \"I know,\" I say. \"But I really, really need to go.\" \"What is wrong with your bladder?\" she exclaims as she crosses three lanes of traffic, hurtles into a service station car park and unlocks the door. \"I don't know,\" I say as I get out. \"I think it must be my kidneys. They keep filtering my liquid intake and excreting the results into it.\" \"You've got the time it takes me to turn round,\" she says, throwing the car into reverse. I just make it. Half an hour later we get stuck behind a woman who has evidently not realised that she has entered the wrong tollbooth queue and so must hunt through her entire bag and vehicle for the necessary coinage. \"Oh, good God woman!\" says Mum, pounding on the wheel, the roof and me in quick succession. \"Do you not understand a simple sign? Cash! Not card! Cash! Cash!\" \"Is there something you're not telling me?\" I ask. \"Have we got transplant organs defrosting in the boot or something?\" Eventually the hapless woman unearths a final 20p and we're off again. By the time we arrive at my auntie's, I am in desperate need of a holiday. But, I realise as my auntie throws open the door and stands, a mirror image of my mother, framed within it, possibly not here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
