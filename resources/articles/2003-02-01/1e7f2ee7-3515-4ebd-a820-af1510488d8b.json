Football is serious business and they have stayed in it thanks only to Ken Booth, their chairman, who bailed them out of administration in 1987 before it was fashionable to go into it. They have ridden the ITV Digital let-down with a squad of less than 20 and postponement of a new stand. As a scrap dealer, Booth could make something of the old one. Reading, seizing on Berkshire's prefix, nicked the name Royals in the 70s and lived up to it on Saturday. Rotherham helped by playing like scrap merchants without the scrap. Reading came up in May and are threatening to do what they were unlucky not to eight seasons ago. Then, as the Premiership adjusted from 22 to 20 clubs, there was only one automatic promotion. Reading came second and missed out in the play-offs. Their captain Adie Williams, the only survivor from then, said they are better equipped this time. They looked it. Their third place is founded on two sequences - six wins in a row in autumn, five now. It is founded also on intelligent movement and high-class passing, which is possible only with the confidence coursing through the side at present. \"My vision,\" said Pardew, \"is to be fast and technically good.\" All three goals were born of quick wits - a throw-in, Andy Hughes finding Nicky Forster's run, Nicky Shorey's volley turning defence to attack. Forster's runs are like Michael Owen's. Liverpool's midfield could learn from watching. Luke Chadwick, David Beckham's understudy on loan, adds an attacking front with his wriggling runs but freak acts of nature may call him back. Reading have won all four with him and have four to go. Pardew's name has long been identified with his Cup semi-final winner for Palace against Liverpool in 1990. With quiet vision he may make it anew. Asked about Reading's lack of an enforcer, he mused on coming out of retirement, then added: \"Trouble is I couldn't pass.\" With a team who can he could see the funny side of that.
