Simon Gray", "bodyText": "Never given quite his due while he was alive, Simon Gray may be receiving it after his death. A version of his play Butley is now on in the West End, with a starry cast and the commendation from our own Michael Billington that the play \"shines like a gold coin\". Perhaps, as with the revival of interest in Terrence Rattigan, it has become acceptable again to like plays that are superbly crafted and take audience entertainment as a primary goal. From Otherwise Engaged on, a constant feature of Gray's work is the sheer pleasure in telling jokes. \"I don't enjoy cutting open my chin with my estranged wife's razor,\" remarks Butley. \"The symbolism may be deft, but the memory smarts.\" This is humour of a particularly British kind, defeated but still acerbic, and in Gray's world it often went hand-in-hand with plays set in British institutions or corners of national history: Cambridge University, or Victorian explorers. That focus led one critic to sneer that the dramatist \"followed mid-century middle-class man into middle age using the middle-class conventions of the boulevardier to do it\". No wonder contemporaries such as Harold Pinter (an admirer and friend of Gray's) were more fashionable. But Gray had his subversive side, too \u2013 his protagonists are often reckless and so was their creator, smoking 60-plus a day and drinking champagne out of a silver goblet. His memoirs, such as Year of the Jouncer and the Smoking Diaries, were rightly seen as superb at the time \u2013 now it is surely time to rehabilitate the plays."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
