Since its launch 25 years ago, the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival has grown into one of the boldest such gatherings in the world, a cutting-edge convention of the avant-garde, as its Victorian town hall, 1990s theatre and various university venues play host to the very latest in all manner of sonic experiences. With 32 world premieres among some 150 pieces performed, this is a brave new world in which the 70-year-old Danish composer Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd and those twin pillars of the New York School, Christian Wolff and Morton Feldman, are regarded as Grand Old Men amid a flotilla of angst-ridden atonal aspirants, N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd and Wolff were on hand to discuss their work and hear a wide range of it played. From solo and small chamber pieces to large orchestral works, N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd remains doggedly unique unto himself, creating a series of discrete sound-worlds owing little to any obvious influences. The most impressive of his many works on display was the 1994-5 Concerto in Due Tempi which required the superb pianist Rolf Hind to play 30 seamless but many-mooded minutes in a different tempo from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Martyn Brabbins. With a lone, detached saxophone playing 'anti-soloist', the effect was as dizzying as the composer presumably intended, with pianist and orchestra taking turns to pull each other in competing directions, resolved by a thrilling cadenza pitting a complex low-register piano line against four metronomes ticking at madly different high speeds. For a 1982 N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd percussion piece entitled 'I Ching', after the Chinese book of proverbs so prized by the New York School, soloist Simon Limbrick filled the town-hall stage with everything including the kitchen sink, in the shape of a blue plastic washing-up bowl in which he appeared to be playing small wooden instruments underwater. With bells not on his toes, but around his thigh, he was also required to whistle and intone the number 'Nine' while moving between great banks of chimes, vibes and drums, including an inverted dustbin. The effect was an entertaining form of chaos, a sort of musical anarchy redeemed only by its qualities as performance art. Far more effective was Feldman's 1964 percussion piece 'The King of Denmark', in which Limbrick played his battery of instruments so quietly, with only the tips of his fingers, that you had to strain to hear whatever Feldman was trying to say. My Shakespearean instincts told me to forget N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd and interpret the title as the shade of Hamlet's father sidling around the ramparts of Elsinore, as a series of unearthly sounds floated around the hall, weird and weightless, fading rivetingly into oblivion. This was minimalism taken to an extreme not far short of John Cage's famous 4' 33\" of 'silence', as was a 1948 Feldman cello piece consisting of just seven random notes. Derived from his love of the abstract canvases of Rothko and others, both works were emblematic of the New York School's symbiosis with the artists of the same postwar period; so it was especially fascinating to hear Feldman's 1951 score for a documentary about the daddy of them all, Jackson Pollock. With the film playing behind them, cellists Lucas Fels and Gregory Johns punctuated the painter's throwaway remarks with Feldman's jagged, swirling footnotes, the musical equivalent of pouring paint onto a horizontal canvas and stirring until it formed a pleasing if unashamedly meaningless pattern. With the Bozzini Quartet's assured performance of Christian Wolff's 1974-6 'Exercises Out of Songs', a patchwork quilt of rhythmic variations on folk themes from a wide range of quasi-political sources, the Old Masters of modern music were painting patterns of a complexity and technical mastery to put their disciples to shame. In this company, Gerald Barry's Second String Quartet sounded a merely self-indulgent exercise, its repetitive motifs circling themselves warily and inconclusively, while Joe Duddell's 'Not Waving But Drowning' brought incongruous echoes of Sondheim, if not Lloyd Webber, to a tasteless symphonic exploration of Stevie Smith's mental fragility. Despite big brass interventions, the disjointed austerity of Stuart MacRae's 'Ancrene Wisse', a setting for soprano and orchestra of the thirteenth-century nuns' manual, also seemed typical of the way too much new British music is aping its dour, war-weary masters, as if it were almost obligatory to be joyless, full of sound and fury but signifying all too little."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
