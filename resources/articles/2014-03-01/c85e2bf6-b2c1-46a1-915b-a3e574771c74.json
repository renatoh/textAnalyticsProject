That was a damp enough squib but the two managers will have learned some lessons. Paletta was excellent for Italy but Diego Costa was poor for Spain. That should have Llorente, Torres and Villa rubbing their hands with glee. Bringing on Silva changed the game, he was excellent \u2013 as was the goalscorer Pedro \u2013and he will have no worries about his place on that plane. Thanks for all the chat, emails, opinions and tweets. Speak soon. Bye! 90 + 1 mins A long ball is headed out by Martinez for a late corner to Italy. It is sent in and flicked on but Alonso gets a head on it and diverts it wide. Another corner. Italy waste it. 90 mins There will be three more minutes of this. 88 mins The life in this game has sadly passed away. 84 mins Cazorla is on Pedro and the Arsenal man is right into the thick of the action. Once again, Silva sets up the chance but Cazorla\u2019s shot is deflected over the bar by Abate. 82 mins Down the other end, Diego Costa has helpfully reminded those of us who had forgotten that he is still on the pitch. He picks the ball up with his back to goal and turns swiftly. He is face to face with the goal but he snatches at his shot and it goes wide of his post. He has been poor tonight, very poor. 79 mins This is better from Italy. Given the requisite time and space, they work their way down the left hand side. A cross is swung in and it finds the feet of Immobile at the edge of the box. In space he is but he can only fumble it \u2013 a bit like Fletcher for Sunderland at the weekend \u2013 and Spain take control once again. 77 mins You and me both. (Wasn\u2019t he pretty poor for Liverpool? Or did I just imagine that?) 75 mins The second yellow card of the game goes to Destro who was unable to keep up with the quick feet of Navas. From the free-kick on the right, Spain put in work but then put out the ball. Ho hum. 72 mins There is just under 20 minutes to play but it looks like both sides are happy as it stands, most seem to be just crushing around the pitch in a state of ennui like Mike, Tony and Cynthia. Wait, hold on, Italy have sparked back in to life and attack down the right. Immobile goes down in the box under a challenge from Raul Albiol and half-heartedly appeals for a penalty. 69 mins Immobile and Destro on for Osvaldo and Cerci. 68 mins \u201cTexas is exactly like Dazed, but the people are much less attractive and overweight than the cast,\u201d says Michelle Miller, dashing all our dreams of the Lone Star State. 66 mins More sub news. Off with Iniesta and Ramos \u2013 the former getting a massive roar for obvious reasons \u2013 and on with Raul Albiol and Jesus Navas. We said that Silva had been sensational since he came on and it is he who starts the move. He picks the ball up on the edge of the area and plays the ball to Iniesta. A sumptuous backheel from him takes a diversion off Paletta into the path of Pedro. He then squirts the ball under the body of Buffon. It had been coming ... 60 mins Since Silva has come on, Spain have been much, much better. He has created about three chances now and even had a few efforts of his own. If I were Juan Mata, I would be very worried about my place in the World Cup squad. Some more sub news. Off with Motta and on with Giaccherini. 59 mins You and me both. 57 mins \u201cI submit Welcome to the Dollhouse for consideration,\u201d submits Michelle Miller, who may, or may not, be a relation to Mac Miller. \u201cBut it is no Dazed and Confused. Dazed and Confused is the best film, but I am biased because I live in Texas.\u201d Is it just like the movie Michelle? 54 mins Italy finally get out of their own half. Osvaldo took down a pass with his chest and was ready to see his name in lights when his shot was blocked in the box. Right after that, Cerci \u2013 who has been great this season \u2013 had a shot smothered by Valdes. 53 mins This is all Spain so far. Italy cannot get out of their own half. \u201cSuicide, mass murder, corn nuts?! What kind of sick, depraved MBM is this?\u201d asks Simon McMahon. \u201cWhat was wrong with chip shops and hitch-hiking to Caracas?\u201d It is the corn nuts that worry me, Simon. 49 mins Some sub on sub action as Abate takes down Silva outside the box, a smidgen to the left. Thiago takes but it takes a clip off the wall and it goes for a corner to Spain. That eventually leads to Silva putting Thiago through one on one with Buffon with the Italian coming out on top. 48 mins \u201cI\u2019m not actually watching the game,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201cbut could this not be the seeds of the Plan B that Spain have lacked in the (very occasional) games where opponents haven\u2019t been broken down/bored into submission? A striker who encourages direct play rather than another dinky, sideways-across-the-edge-of-the-box pass?\u201d If it ain\u2019t broke ... 46 mins Some sub news for you. For Spain, Alonso is on, Silva is on and Valdes is on (for Casillas, Busquets and Fabregas). For Italy Pirlo is on, De Sciglio is on and Abate is on (for Maggio, Candreva and Criscito). 45 mins We are back. 45 mins That is that. Back in 15 minutes. 43 mins More excellence from Pedro on the right. He gets the ball, brushes his way past Criscito, who does his best to take him down and eventually gets a yellow card for his efforts, and then twinkle toes his way into the box. His cross is a touch overhit and Italy turn it away from a corner. Spain do nothing with that. 42 mins Diego Costa is all right by the way but there is a case to be made that Spain do not look as fluid as they generally do with him up front. Looking to find the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid forward seems to stop their flow of passes and movement. They\u2019ll have to work hard to settle him into the rhythm. 40 mins \u201cHeathers is terrible. Dazed gave us Wooderson. End of,\u201d reckons Michael Bertin. 39 mins Italy give the ball way on the half-way line and Iniesta takes flight down the left. The fans sense that something is coming and they beat a metal rhythm from the stands. Then the unthinkable happens, Iniesta gives the ball away. That might be the first time he has ever done this. History happening right here. 36 mins Gooooooooooooooal! ... but not in this game. 35 mins If I am not mistaken \u2013 and it is very possible that I am \u2013 it looks like Diego Costa has just asked to be taken off. The camera panned to him and he did the universal substitute sign with his hands. He also looks to be walking a bit gingerly. Will keep you posted on that as it could have serious repercussions for the title race in Spain. 33 mins \u201cIs Heathers better than Dazed and Confused? asks an incredulous Daniel Stauss. \u201cDid you seriously just ask that question, given what we can safely assume about the sort of people who will share their opinion on the topic? If you haven\u2019t seen Heathers, you should. It\u2019s a terrifically dark comedy about teenage suicide, bullying, homophobia, mass murder and corn nuts. Plus, it is imminently quotable. I\u2019d go so far as to call it a must-see.\u201d Corn nuts? 31 mins Corner to Italy. It is aimed for Osvaldo but it finds a Spanish head. 29 mins Down at the other end of the pitch, Osvaldo is keen to prove that he is more than just a good defender. He finds himself with the ball at the end of his feet, just outside the Spain box after a neat Marchisio backheel flick. Osvaldo pulls back his leg and it is off with the ball. Casillas dives and watches it whistle past his post. 27 mins Free-kick to Spain on the corner of the box after some naughty stuff from Thiago Motta. Iniesta sends it in. Centre-back\u2019s Osvaldo sends it right back out. Spain keep the pressure pumping but the debutant Paletta \u2013 who has been impressively solid so far \u2013 deals with it, allowing his side to breathe again. 25 mins Matt Dony has been back in touch re the Heathers/Dazed and Confused debate. \u201cGreat films both, but Heathers has Winona Ryder. It\u2019s therefore better than almost any other film.\u201d Maybe but Dazed and Confused has Michelle Burke. 22 mins And what a lovely move this is from Spain. Pedro picks the ball up on the right wing and slips inside. (He is great to watch in full flow.) He then leaves Criscito \u2013 I think \u2013 for dead, before slipping a delicate pass into the path of Diego Costa who has darted into the box. That is where the good move ends, however, as Costa\u2019s effort is blocked by Paletta and does not trouble a hair on the head of Buffon. 19 mins \u201cI\u2019m following this MBM but slogging my way through watching the England game\u201d says multi-tasking\u2019s Matt Dony. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun. And, thanks to that reminder, I might just put on Heathers instead. Thanks, Liam.\u201d What is all this Heathers talk? Is it any use? Better than Dazed and Confused? 17 mins Osvaldo is down, holding his face like he has been slapped with a pair of black leather gloves. In reality, he got a nudge from the shoulder of Ramos. The referee sees through his antics like Grandma\u2019s underpants and the Italian forward is soon back to his feet. 15 mins A corner to Spain. It is played short to Thiago who tries his luck from inside the book. Osvaldo hooks it away but Spain soon win another. This one is taken long but Osvaldo repeats his earlier heroic feats. 13 mins Spain have been doing their thing just outside the Italian box for the last few minutes, passing, passing, passing. They eventually spread it wide to the left in order to hang in a cross for Diego Costa to get his head on. This they do but the Italian defence hold firm and the present danger is swiftly eradicated. 11 mins We are back to the passing game. Tiki, taka. Tiki, taka. Tiki, taka. Tiki, taka. Yada, yada. Yada, yada. Yada, yada. Yada, yada. 8 mins \u201cIntroduced my newly teenage daughter to a couple of eighties classics in the last few months\u201d says Liam Rooney. \u201cThe Breakfast Club, which she got and enjoyed, Heathers, much my favourite, which she didn\u2019t.\u201d Big Breakfast Club fan. The movie, not the London-based coffee shop. They put too much avocado on their food. 6 mins This is a very open, eh, opening to the game. Pedro has just picked the ball up outside the box and snapped and effort at Buffon\u2019s onion bag. The Italian No1 saved easily enough. 4 mins How does Del Bosque reckon Casillas is good enough for Spain but Mourinho and Ancelotti reckon he ain\u2019t good enough for Madrid? I speak of the keeper as he was just almost caught out by a chip from Cerci (who ghosted past Ramos) which floated over him and hit the post only to come back into the keeper\u2019s welcoming arms. 2 mins Shock in Madrid as Spain spend the first few minutes passing the ball about the pitch in a neat and orderly fashion, forcing Italy to chase it as a dog would with a stick. On the left, Iniesta fashions a good chance for Alba but the full-back can do nothing with it. Spain get a corner. They do less with that than Alba did with his effort. 1 min Before we get the game going there is a tribute to Luis Aragon\u00e9s (which is impeccably observed and brings tears to the eyes of some fans) but once that is done, we are off and running. Spain are in black, for the first time in their history and playing left to right. It is they who get the game going. Italy are in their traditional blue. There is 99 problems days till the World Cup gets going but there is about 99 seconds until Spain versus Italy gets going. The stadium looks half empty \u2013 are Spanish fans not interested in friendlies with Italy or have they been priced out of it? \u2013 but that should not detract from the quality that is going to be on show for tonight. \u201cDiego Costa playing for two countries in one year?\u201d says Daniel Stauss. \u201cAllright allright allright. Can\u2019t blame the guy for wanting to keep a little change in his pocket. Just gotta keep livin\u2019, man, L-I-V-I-N.\u201d Brilliant stuff, Daniel. By the way, did you know that Matthew McConaughey\u2019s production company\u2019s name, JKL Productions, comes from Wooderson\u2019s life credo, just keep livin\u2019?\u201d So says the nice people from IMDB anyway. And the big news is that Diego Costa starts for Spain. That means that in less than a year he has done a debut for two countries with both matches coming against Italy. Unbelievable (Jeff). Rather unusually, Javi Martinez is starting in the centre of defence alongside Sergio Ramos. what could go wrong there, eh? As for Italy, Paletta of Parma also makes his debut but there is no Pirlo (boooooooo!), who is rested, and there is no Chiellini, who is not fit. Expect them to line up in a 4-3-3 with an interesting attacking trio of Candreva, Osvaldo, Cerci. Those teams in full then are: Spain: Casillas; Azpilicueta, Javi Martinez, Ramos, Alba; Busquets, Thiago Alcantara; Pedro, Fabregas, Iniesta; Diego Costa. Subs: the rest of the squad Italy: Buffon; Maggio, Paletta, Barzagli, Criscito; Marchisio, Thiago Motta, Montolivo; Candreva, Osvaldo, Cerci. Subs: the rest of the squad \u201cEvening Ian\u201d cheers Simon McMahon, who is eager to get stuck into tonight\u2019s topic. \u201cSometimes the obvious choices are the best. If we\u2019re talking high-school movies (and football) then Gregory\u2019s Girl is at the top of the list. Jake D\u2019Arcy, who played PE teacher and football coach Phil Menzies, also played one of the most memorably named characters in Scottish comedy - Fud O\u2019Donnell in Tutti Frutti. Although things are looking up under Strachan, it feels like Scotland have had quite a few Fuds playing for them in recent years.\u201d Have yet to see this, can anyone back up Simon\u2019s claim? There is this scene in Dazed and Confused. Cynthia, Tony and Mike are cruising around. Cynthia is driving, Tony is shotgun and Mike is in the back. Pickford was supposed to be having a party and the group gave up their usual game of poker to go. That got busted thanks to the work shy Ben though and since the trio are not cool enough to hang at the Emporium, they are driving around talking politics, life and engaging in teenage ennui. But Mike can\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to go out we shouldn\u2019t just drive around we should do something.\u201d Cynthia says they are \u201cbut what? I mean, God. Don\u2019t you ever feel like everything we do and everything we\u2019ve been taught is just to service the future ... if we\u2019re all going to die anyway shouldn\u2019t we be enjoying ourselves now? You know, I\u2019d like to quit think of the present, like right now as some minor insignificant preamble to something else.\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d replies Mike, \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody in this car needs. Some good old worth-while visceral experience.\u201d \u201cSome minor insignificant preamble to something else\u201d might just be the most apt description, not just of how teenagers see life, but of an international friendly in the middle of the season in a World Cup year too. Still, there is no reason why like Cynthia, Tony and Mike\u2019s trip to the party at the Moon Tower some good old worthwhile visceral experience cannot be had (Cynthia found Wooderson, Tony found Sabrina \u2013 weren\u2019t her parents worried that she was out that late? \u2013 and Mike found a fight). After all this is Italy and Spain, two of the greatest nations to ever send out 11 players with the expressed intent of trying to kick a ball in their opponent\u2019s net as many times as possible. Let\u2019s take a step back in time to when some of you were teenagers, shall we? It\u2019s 2008 and the European Championships. \u201cDespite the fact that Spain cruised through their group, despite the fact they have arguably the two best forwards at the tournament at their disposal, despite the fact that Italy failed to beat Romania, limped unconvincingly past a poor France, were unceremoniously whupped by Holland, have their two key central midfielders suspended and a striker somehow managing to avoid scoring despite the chances created for him, despite all this we all expect Spain to fail,\u201d wrote my colleague John Ashdown in his preamble to the quarter-final match between these two sides. He had a point. Italy were Spain\u2019s bogey team. They had not beaten them in major tournament since their first meeting at the 1920 Olympics and the Spanish broke out in a cold sweat at the very whisper of catenaccio. But that penalty shootout victory in Vienna changed that, changed Spain\u2019s mentality and changed football forever. Before it, Spain had been one long, steady disappointment to fans and friends, consistently under-performing on the big stage. Afterwards they were almost invincible and they have since become the greatest national team of all time. (Do holler if you think there has been a better one.) The man in charge of Spain that night was Luis Aragon\u00e9s. He passed away last month. \u201cLuis laid out the path for us to follow in his footsteps\u201d said the current Spain manager, Vicente del Bosque. \u201cThanks to his idea of football and his relationship with the group, the country has achieved continued success\u201d. Fittingly, tonight\u2019s game will take place in Aragon\u00e9s home from home, the Vicente Calder\u00f3n, and for the first time in their history, and as a mark of respect, Spain will wear black. It is worth noting that there are a number of high-profile Spanish players who will not be wearing black and will have to watch this game from the comfort of their sofas, biting their nails and being irritable with their kids as they worry about their place on the plane to Brazil. There is no Carles Puyol, there is \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa, there is no Fernando Torres (meh!), there is David de Gea (bit harsh?) there is no Fernando Llorente (very harsh!) there is no David Villa and there is no Juan Mata (not sure how to feel about that one). There is, however, deserved call-ups for C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta and Diego Costa, who is fully expected to make his debut for La Furia Roja at some stage this evening. Cesare \u201cI didn\u2019t want to play this friendly\u201d Prandelli has also called up some new faces to the Italian squad. Ciro Immobile, Gabriel Paletta and Mattia Perin all got the text saying that they were required for national service. (Perin, in particular, deserved his call-up.) Daniele De Rossi\u2019s phone remained textless after his dust-up with Mauro Icardi in the Inter game at the weekend. According to the Italian manager, the Roma man broke \u201cthe [team\u2019s] code of ethics\u201d. There is also no Mario Balotelli which is a shame \u2013 he is in pain with a shoulder injury \u2013 given Spain\u2019s paucity of quality options at the back but there is certainly enough Italian attacking might to worry that Spanish backline, not least Torino\u2019s Alessio Cerci and age-defying\u2019s Alberto Gilardino. \u201cMatches with the Azzurri are always exciting duels,\u201d said Sergio Ramos in his pre-match presser which is really just player speak for a good old worth-while visceral experience is on its way, right? Stayed tuned for that and stayed tuned for team news. Both are coming."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
