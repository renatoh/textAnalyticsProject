The flagship policy of George Osborne\u2019s summer budget was his \u201cnational living wage\u201d \u2013 a 50p increase in the statutory minimum pay rate for the over-25s from April, to \u00a37.20 an hour, followed by a series of stepped increases expected to take the rate above \u00a39 an hour by 2020. The policy has been widely welcomed, including by campaigners for a living wage. But Cridland will use a speech on Thursday, marking the CBI\u2019s 50th anniversary, to sound a note of caution, becoming the latest business leader to express concern about the chancellor\u2019s plan. \u201cA \u00a37.20 national living wage in 2016 and a \u00a39 national living wage by 2020 are laudable objectives, but they are a gamble,\u201d he will say. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to many CEOs who feel they may now have to make changes to their business models, which could result in fewer job and progression opportunities.\u201d Whitbread, the owner of Costa Coffee, warned on Tuesday that prices may have to rise in order to pay for the higher wage rates. Cridland, who will step down after the CBI\u2019s annual conference in November, will also reflect on the shifts in the economy over the past five years. He will play down the risk of the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d \u2013 the weak growth in output-per-hour achieved since the crisis \u2013 saying: \u201cIn our data-driven, knowledge-based economy, where services play a key role, it\u2019s less and less just about the quantity of widgets coming off production lines and more and more about the quality of customer interaction.\u201d Cridland will also question policymakers\u2019 enthusiasm for rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing and away from services, arguing that the dividing line between the two is becoming increasingly blurred. The CBI believes that manufacturing may account for up to 19% of economic output, twice the level that shows up in the national accounts, once contracts to service manufacturers\u2019 products, and the functions they outsource to other providers, are taken into account. \u201cA transformation currently taking place within the sector is rendering the distinction between services and manufacturing less and less meaningful,\u201d Cridland will say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
