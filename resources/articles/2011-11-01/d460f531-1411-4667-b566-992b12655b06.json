I could be accused of being prone to distraction and lacking in focus, but I frequently pick up the binoculars that I leave on my office windowsill. I find watching the birds on our seed-and nut-feeders good for the soul: a welcome antidote to the pressures of 21st-century life and something I must find a way of incorporating into my coaching \"narrative\". (You'll note that I have already chosen the image of the green woodpecker \u2013 a frequent visitor \u2013 for my profile photo). In recognition of the contribution that garden birds make to my general wellbeing, I decided to invest part of the working day yesterday in a trip to Costco in Watford to stock up on bird seed and nuts for the winter (12kg bags are just a fiver). I thought it would be quiet first thing on a Friday but at this point each week they offer free coffee and give away all the pastries past their sell-by dates. Hordes descend on the place as a result \u2013 I did find myself wondering why these people didn't have jobs to go to. Back at home, I filled the seed-feeder and hung it off the apple tree. Dave, our gardener, was at work with the leaf-blower. I say \"at work\", but he stopped every two minutes or so to do something with his mobile phone. I can't remember how much we pay Dave's company each month since, like so much else in the Wadhurst household, it leaves my bank account by standing order. I must speak to Sandra about it since we need a hard look at our cost base as I continue to invest in my start-up coaching business. Part of my growth strategy, as you know, is to embrace social media. Hot on the heels of Phil's seminar, I am delighted to announce that I am \"on\" Twitter. I was pleased to find that it's free to join and the first person to follow me was Jeremy of Chaffinch Chartered Accountants of Bovingdon. I was happy to follow him in return, and am now on my way to building up my audience. Derek Skyped me yesterday and put something of a dampener on things. He had his webcam on and looked a little rough \u2013 unshaven and in his dressing gown. \"Seth Godin has an audience,\" he said rather negatively when I updated him about Twitter. \"You and the accountant are just taking in each other's washing.\" I fear that Derek simply doesn't \"get it\" \u2013 I am determined to use social media to my advantage. Will make my first \"tweet\" just as soon as I've come up with something suitably enlightening. Last night, I turned in with the intention of sleeping on it in the hope that I would wander into the office this morning with a creative idea for my tweet. Sadly, the first thing I observed when I looked out of the window was the nut-feeder on the grass. A squirrel had prised off the lid and was cheerfully filling his cheeks. \u2022 Follow Geoffrey on Twitter and connect with him on LinkedIn"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
