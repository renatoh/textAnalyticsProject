It is often said, for example, that in terms of physical looks they resemble Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise. George, the taller, has the same high forehead and black-rimmed glasses as Eric, while Gilbert corresponds to a melancholy version of Ernie. Personally, I'm reminded more of Philip Larkin and Peter Lorre, but the Eric and Ernie model has a number of merits. Like that sublime duo, G&amp;G, as they refer to themselves, are indivisible, quintessentially British and very funny. They have their own funny walk (a robotic stride in tandem); their own funny dance (called the bend-it) and their matching funny suits (heavy worsted numbers made by a local tailor). They are never seen outside their suits, except in their art, where they have appeared naked and bent over with their buttocks displayed. I ask them if they wear the same suits when they go on holiday. 'Oh we have different suits for hot countries,' replies George. What do you wear then? 'Same thing, but a tropical weight,' he explains. 'We'd look silly in these suits.' The humour, of course, is in the idea that they don't look silly the rest of the time. Theirs is also a partnership, like Morecambe and Wise's, that through sheer longevity and hard work has reached a seamless perfection. Such is the honed entertainment of their performance that it's easy to be distracted from their work as artists. And such is the stark candour of their work that it's hard not to make judgments about them as people. It's a situation further complicated by the fact that the pair feature prominently in their art, and that they are as polite and circumspect in person as their work is provocative and explicit. On these taut ambiguities and subtle tensions G&amp;G have been skilfully playing for 35 years. To this party, the interviewer has very little to bring other than a tape recorder. They have heard every clever gambit and intrusive question and have fielded them all with practised aplomb. And when that fails, stubborn resistance. So it was with a sense of cheery resignation, like that of a weekend chess player taking on a couple of grand masters, that I entered their Georgian terraced house near Spitalfields in east London. An immaculate renovation of 18th-century architecture, it is decorated with a superb collection of late 19th-century British art and design. They have lived here, or hereabouts, since they met at St Martin's School of Art back in 1967. For decades it was a run down and forgotten corner of London, now the surrounding streets are filled with successful YBAs (Young British Artists). The trendification of their neighbourhood is symbolic of their changed position in the British art scene. For years they were viewed as either a sinister aberration or a quaint curiosity. But in the YBA era they find themselves at the centre of fashion, if not quite part of it. The aspects of their work that once set them apart - self-revelation, profanity and body fluids - are now standard in contemporary art. Last year, Jay Joplin, the owner of the White Cube gallery and the man behind Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, became their new dealer. 'We used to be with Anthony D'Offay,' says Gilbert, 'and sometimes we asked him to arrange a show and we always felt he loved coming back to say, \"They don't like you.\"' Not nearly as much, one could almost imagine, as G&amp;G loved it themselves. Even though they obviously can't abide disapproval, they seem to derive an almost masochistic pleasure in it, nonetheless. They are also constitutionally and emotionally incapable of being part of anything but themselves. That they enjoy enormous international renown, are collected across the globe and were winners of the Turner Prize in 1986 seems only to endorse their perception of themselves as outsiders. When I point out the obvious contradiction of this stance, over tea in their garden studio, George replies: 'We think we're very established, but we are not establishment.' I wondered if it hadn't become something of a full-time occupation not being part of the establishment. 'No,' says Gilbert, 'they do it to us. We want to, in some ways, but they never let us.' Who doesn't let you? Gilbert: 'All the establishment.' George: 'Editors, governmental agencies.' Gilbert: 'From the Tate down: the British Council, the Arts Council, that sort of stuff. We never did anything in the Tate gallery ever.' In fact, Tate Britain has a room devoted to their very early work, but it's true that the last major exhibition they had in this country was at the Hayward Gallery back in the 1987. The show that opens at the Serpentine next month is of The Dirty Words Pictures, a sort of pictorial Tourette syndrome that was created and originally seen as long ago as 1977. Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate, counts himself as a fan and believes their recent work is some of their best yet. 'It's always difficult for prophets in their own country,' he says. Gilbert was actually born and grew up in the Dolomites. And he retains an Italian accent which in an odd, Ealing comedy way makes him sound peculiarly British. George, a product of childhood elocution lessons, is the owner of impeccable vowels. The contrast is underlined by Gilbert's giggling delivery and George's cool precision. They are both, as George says, war babies - George was born in 1942 and Gilbert the year after. Their backgrounds have been the subject of much debate, although they maintain a blanket of secrecy over events prior to their first meeting. All the same, sparse details of their lives have been unearthed by various writers, most notably Daniel Farson. It seems very likely that George was once married and had two children, and that he left them a short while after meeting Gilbert. The artists have never said that they are gay - a term they dislike - but are open about being a couple. Out of journalistic duty, I ask about the rumours. George: 'We don't discuss them.' Why not? George: 'It's not helpful.' It would be helpful to me. George: 'We don't believe in it.' But if you have been married and had children then that is interesting. George: 'I can't think of an artist that hasn't had a complicated life.' If you have children that gives you a whole other emotional hinterland. George: 'Just like anyone.' Perhaps, but you don't present yourselves that way. George: 'That's because we're artists.' Or because you are the particular artists you are. George: 'G&amp;G. Extraordinary.' There is a pause. Um, I say, I'm not sure that's an answer. George: 'What was the question?' Do you have a wife and children? George: 'We never discuss family backgrounds. That wouldn't be helpful.' Checkmate. As has been noted before, George seems to be the most watchful guard of the G&amp;G story. While Gilbert is not exactly forthcoming, he is more prepared to clear up a misunderstanding. When I say it seems that, for all their bearing on their lives today, their past biographies could be entirely made up, Gilbert tells me that what Farson wrote was 'broadly true'. He also says that both he and George are 'from very poor working-class families with some childish idea of wanting to be an artist'. Class makes frequent entries in their conversation. They often set themselves up as victims of a petty and bureaucratic middle class. It's tempting, therefore, to see their work, with its depictions of disenfranchised youth, slums and excrement, as if not quite a critique of the British class system, then at least an attack on bourgeois values. George is not willing to be so readily defined. He points out that class is less of an issue in this country than it is abroad. 'If you stand at an [art] opening in London, you stand among people. If you stand at one on the continent everyone gives you cards with Countess Von Stufenberg on them. Who's this daft old bat sitting next to me? She's a princess? It's absurd.' Because they like to joke, G&amp;G have been accused of being one big joke, an epic but ironic piece of performance art designed to ridicule the art world, critics, the media and the very idea of being an artist. It's a suggestion they have little patience with. But you can see why some might come to that conclusion. They appear from time to time to say things for effect. Not long after The Dirty Pictures were first shown, they were quoted saying vaguely disparaging things about Asians. They now complain that they were misconstrued and that, as the saying goes, some of their closest friends are Bangladeshis. The problem, they argue, is that they once admitted to being Tories. 'You can discuss voting Conservative with your mother, with the waiter, taxi driver, but not with the art world,' says George. 'To say you are Conservative is to say you're a Nazi. It's absurd. We want the freedom to say that. We're more socialistic than those left-wing people anyway. We do art that reaches out to deal with issues that concern everybody. They just do this obscure, elitist art. They do conservative art.' But it's not only a matter of politics or aesthetics. Their whole approach to their work is dressed up in heightened opinions, manifestos, declarations and laws that seem too melodramatic to be true. A typical example would be George claiming, as he did last year, that, 'We don't want to be polluted by art. We don't want to read books, to look back in history.' In reality, they are well-read historians. And while they have published more material defining their artistic vision than any other artist in history, they insist their work is unplanned and intuitive. 'We want to fall into the pictures,' says George, 'not think how they should be. We don't discuss anything. There's some strange mysterious thing even to us. We feel that we have to go along two roads at the same time. One is completely orderly and methodical and the whole studio has to be exaggeratedly organised before we start anything. But at the same time we have to go down the road where we're completely crazed and mad in the head.' 'We're like overexcited scientists,' Gilbert adds, sniggering silently. The result has been a series of beautifully composed images that lay bare what we think of as the ugliness and mess of life: council tower blocks, urine, anuses, sweat, blood and giant, blown-up turds. These pictures, made of large photographic grids that look like stained-glass windows, have titles like Eight Shits, Spunk and Tears, Piss on Us and Blood on Shit. The gap between the cool composition and the heated subject matter has done nothing to dispel the notion that G&amp;G maintain an ironic detachment from the work. According to the artists, though, the opposite is true. Their work is born of a genuine commitment to change ideas about freedom, identity and sexuality. 'Our philosophy is simple,' Gilbert once said. 'We want more tolerance and more complexity.' And it's a commitment, they say, which involves a tremendous emotional cost. 'If the viewer has a problem looking at pictures of shit,' says George, 'it's nothing compared with the difficulty of actually creating those pictures. Imagine creating these in 1977,' he says, gesturing at photocopies of the Dirty Pictures, 'and then going out to the world.' 'One person on their own couldn't do it,' says Gilbert. 'I wouldn't be able to write up \"Cunt\" and stand up for it alone, or even the \"Naked Shit\". I couldn't do that alone.' 'It's very simple,' says George. 'We want to do it and we don't want to do it.' So the problem is the anxiety about how their art will be received? 'No, no,' they both say in unison. But the truthful answer is surely yes, yes. 'I think the work they do is very personal,' says Serota. 'It must make them vulnerable to criticism and comment.' Although the critical consensus is probably now in their favour, there has in the past been no shortage of brickbats sent flying in their direction. The late Peter Fuller spoke of the 'evil of banality'. Brian Sewell warned us to 'beware of strange men who do funny things' and Roger Scruton said in 1988 that G&amp;G 'are so devoid of artistic talent as to be capable of producing no emotion whatsoever'. Clearly, if Sewell and Scruton are against them, there's a good chance they are doing something right. But although they obviously crave recognition and approbation, it's not something they particularly cherish. Meticulous collectors, they showed me their large cupboard of carefully dated press cuttings. They read all the reviews and reports on them. 'But we only read the good ones once,' says Gilbert. 'We're not really interested in them. It's the bad ones that we think about.' This, I suspect, is where the psychological truth of G&amp;G is to be found, in their preoccupation with bad notices. It's the same instinct that draws them to taboo words and functions in their work. I used to think it was a rather childish need to shock, but now I see that's all about fear. They cling to the poor reviews because they represent the very thing they dread: rejection. In much the same way they expose their bum holes and the stuff inside because they represent their vulnerability, a vulnerability that in life they protect with an elaborate, if amusing, act. I ask them what it was that got them up in the morning after 35 years of producing art together. 'Because they never accepted us,' answers George. 'That's what.' 'We still want to win,' adds Gilbert. 'We don't think we've won.' So what then would demonstrate a victory? 'A big show at the Tate,' says Gilbert without hesitation. 'A big retrospective.' Serota told me that they shared that ambition with a number of artists. And although such a show was in the Tate's thoughts, there were no plans in the next year. What about in the next five years? 'I'd be really surprised,' he said, 'if it didn't happen within that time.' I had already asked G&amp;G what would happen if they did get the exhibition they wanted at the Tate. 'Nothing,' was Gilbert's reply. 'You have to invent yourself again. Always look forward. Never look backwards.' And soon after he said that, they retreated back into their 18th-century home, with its 19th-century furniture and files full of the past, to play out their hermetic present and start work once again on reshaping the future. \u00b7 Gilbert &amp; George, The Dirty Words Pictures, 1977, Serpentine Gallery, London (020 7298 1515), 6 June to 1 September 2002."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
