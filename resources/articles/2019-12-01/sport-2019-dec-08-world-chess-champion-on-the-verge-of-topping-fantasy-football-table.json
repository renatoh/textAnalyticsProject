The grandmaster is enjoying his best season ever in the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) game and after Sunday\u2019s results he climbed to the sixth position in a table of more than 7 million players worldwide. Carlsen, who is currently competing at the London Chess Classic at Olympia, puts his fantasy football success down to luck. But his FPL team, Kjell Ankedal, has consistently scored high in the overall rankings for the past four years, finishing among the top 3,000 players in the 2017\u20132018 league. This season, it took Carlsen just six weeks to make it into the top 1,000 and he has been climbing up the table ever since. It will not comfort anyone languishing in the FPL\u2019s lower millions to learn that Carlsen is also an occasional model. Asked to comment on his success this season, Carlsen cited the Opta data used by FPL players to track footballing form. \u201cIn fantasy football I\u2019m both an optimist and an Optamist,\u201d he told the Guardian in a one line email. Like many Norwegians, Carlsen is obsessed with both the Premier League and its fantasy league spin-off. In 2017, eight players from Norway were in the top 50 FPL players in the world. Norway has an advantage for FPL obsessives because of the relatively free availability of live matches on the country\u2019s TV channels, compared to broadcast restrictions in other countries. Carlsen likes to relax before matches by kicking a ball about and when he is not playing chess he spends hours watching English football, according to chess journalist Tarjei Svensen, who has known Carlsen since he was eight and follows all of his games. \u201cHis ability at fantasy league has been known for a couple of seasons now, but this season has been exceptional and he\u2019s had another good week,\u201d Svensen said. He added: \u201cHis rise up the charts is incredible. He had a really good year for a while last season and then he dropped a couple of hundred places at the end of the season, but he was still in the top 1,000.\u201d Svensen reckons Carlsen excels at FPL because of a phenomenal memory for Premier League details. \u201cHis level of knowledge about English football is amazing, which must help him a lot,\u201d he says. When a Norwegian film crew stumbled upon Carlsen celebrating France\u2019s victory over Romania at Euro 2016, he was singing a West Ham chant praising Dimitri Payet, the French player who was at the club at the time. In general, the cerebral skills of chess are thought to be a big advantage in fantasy football. Svenson says: \u201cIt is a similar game, it requires planning and strategy. And he has an incredible memory which helps.\u201d The 29-year-old reigning world chess champion tops an elite FPL made up solely of chess grandmasters and is dominating another where Martin \u00d8degaard, a Norwegian prodigy who became the youngest player to represent Real Madrid, is languishing near the bottom of the table. \u201cHe is really competitive at anything he does. Any competition he enters he really wants to win,\u201d Svensen said. This season Carlsen astutely chose Sheffield United\u2019s John Lundstram from the start, as well as bringing in both Liverpool forwards Mo Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 and Tottenham\u2019s Son Heung-min. He\u2019s also benefited from some good fortune \u2013 such as the moment Wolves\u2019 Leander Dendoncker came off the bench for Carlsen last week to score his only goal of the season so far. Svenson says: \u201cClearly there is some luck but when you do consistently so well, it isn\u2019t luck. He says he has a lot of time on his hands because he doesn\u2019t have a regular job. And he is just a huge football fan, he watches everything. I once went to White Hart Lane with him to watch Spurs. But he doesn\u2019t have a favourite English team, he supports Real Madrid.\u201d When he was asked about the success of his FPL team on Norwegian TV in October, Carlsen was worried such questions would jinx his performance. Still, he climbed from 162 in the table to the top three. Carlsen said: \u201cIn chess, you know when you\u2019ve done well and when you\u2019ve done poorly, but it\u2019s hard for me to take praise for fantasy league, when I\u2019ve just been lucky.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
