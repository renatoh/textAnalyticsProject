The head coach, Eddie Jones, has previously said he does not see Robshaw as an openside flanker but is running out of specialists before the Test with Samoa on Saturday. With Underhill stood down after he sustained his second concussion of the autumn, Tom Curry out having dislocated a wrist in training this month and James Haskell exiled from the squad, the other openside candidate currently in Bagshot is Exeter\u2019s Sam Simmonds. The two main names flagged up by Jones, though, were Itoje and Robshaw, who were first paired in an England back row during the third Test against Australia in Sydney in June 2016. England won that contest 44-40 but Robshaw was replaced in the third quarter by Jack Clifford in a game during which Teimana Harrison was also hauled off after half an hour. Itoje was subsequently viewed as a strong candidate to start at No7 last autumn only to fracture a hand and miss all of England\u2019s November Tests, offering an unexpected recall to Northampton\u2019s Tom Wood. With other alternatives such as Wasps\u2019 Sam Jones ruled out by injury and Exeter\u2019s Don Armand still studiously ignored, Jones had been hoping Underhill would nail down the position and establish himself as a regular starter. Unfortunately for all, the 21-year-old had to be replaced inside the first quarter against Australia, having hurt himself tackling the Australian No8 Sean McMahon. He was also concussed playing for Bath against Northampton in September. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the view that we won\u2019t risk him this weekend,\u201d Jones said. The upshot could be that both Robshaw and Itoje now start in the back row alongside Nathan Hughes against Samoa, who were beaten by Romania last weekend. \u201cRobshaw might get the six-and-a-half jersey out again,\u201d joked Jones. \u201cWe can roll that out or we can play Maro at seven. We can experiment because in the World Cup we might have to do that. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us.\u201d The better news for England is that the Harlequins full-back Mike Brown is fit having been concussed against Argentina. Jones is due to trim down his squad on Tuesday evening but does not sound inclined to give all his Lions the week off. \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have got to remember that if we don\u2019t play them they go back to their clubs.\u201d Jones has been further encouraged by fitness data showing the sprint times of his backs and the number of accelerations per match among his forwards have improved by up to 4% apiece since the last Six Nations. He remains wary, even so, of the Samoans having toured in the islands with Japan. \u201cWe went to Fiji and played in a monsoon. I never saw heavier rain. We got absolutely dished. I can still remember our scrum going backwards at a rate of knots. It\u2019s different playing there.\u201d The Australian was also a fan of the uncompromising Samoan centre Brian Lima and is keen to support Pacific islands rugby. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s important to keep island rugby strong because they bring a uniqueness to the game. They\u2019ve got fantastic natural skills that, when galvanised together, produces a game no one else can play. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re playing Samoa. It\u2019s going to help Samoan rugby.\u201d As yet the players have not yet collectively discussed Mako Vunipola\u2019s proposal that they all donate at least \u00a31,000 of their \u00a322,000 match fees to their counterparts, whose union has been declared bankrupt. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens this week but we haven\u2019t spoken about it,\u201d said Bath\u2019s Anthony Watson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
