These are the type of details that float downstream from generation to generation. But there were the kind of hard, glinting facts that one can only find by looking at a census and which will remain there, long after names and faces and stories have been forgotten. I went looking for these yesterday, as the 1841 census for England and Wales was published online for the first time. A collaboration between the National Archives and the subscription-based website Ancestry.co.uk, the census took four years to digitise, and those listed include Charles Dickens and Queen Victoria. It is the last census of any real use to historians and therefore will be the final one to appear online. I was not the only surfer. The publication of UK censuses on the internet, from 1901 and beyond, has sparked a phenomenal interest in family genealogy. Four years ago, when the 1901 census appeared, the system crashed after three hours because a million users had logged on. Websites such as Origins.net and Familyrelatives.org have sprung up all over the place. Interest was further fuelled by the spectacularly popular BBC series Who Do You Think You Are? which showed celebrities such as Bill Oddie and Jeremy Paxman discovering their origins. The 1841 census offers us just the bare bones of information to suck upon, however. Those completing the census on the night of June 6 1841 were asked for the name of their street, their house number or name, and the name of each person who had spent the night in that household, their age, sex, occupation and where they were born. In the published form, ages are usually rounded down to the nearest five years, places of birth are not given and family relationships are frequently vague. Another problem is that the returns were compiled in pencil rather than pen, which makes the microfilmed images occasionally difficult to read. Still, following the tributaries of my own family history is not so very difficult at first: I can trace back as far as my great-grandparents through a combination of online censuses and family anecdotes. Thereafter, it grows more difficult - there are names, places, rumours, but the hard facts dry up. I was born in 1977 in Billinge, Lancashire, at the same hospital where my dad was born on Christmas Day, 1942. His parents were Edith Bond, a sales assistant at Baxter's general store in Upholland, who married Norman Barton, an electrician who would eventually take over the family hardware store. My paternal grandparents are there in the births and marriages files I search online. As are my maternal grandparents, Jack and Dorothy Wilson, who had my mother, Stephanie Wilson, in 1948, and lived in New Springs outside Wigan. It's strange to see the names of those family members you know there in an official document: it's a little like seeing people you know well all dressed up formally in black tie. My maternal grandmother was born Dorothy Derbyshire in 1920 and married my grandpa in 1944 when they were both still in the army - he a captain in the Black Watch, fighting overseas, while she was a driver in the ATS. They are almost unrecognisable from the people who bathed my brother and me, fed us, held our hands as we walked over Orrell motorway bridge and helped us make cars out of cardboard boxes and paper plates. It's somehow less bizarre to discover the next layer of distant relatives, the first ones to appear on the available censuses - great grandparents and their parents; people I've only seen in sepia photographs wearing christening gowns and ridiculous moustaches. There's my grandad's parents, for example, Catherine Pilkington, who ran a hardware store and Andrew Barton, an electrician and sometime tinker. And my granny's parents, Sarah Lucinda Ferguson, a lady's maid at the rectory at Haigh, Major Thomas Derbyshire (not a real Major, I hasten to add; that was, curiously, his first name) a master painter and decorator, from Wigan. And even though I never knew them, I have seen where they lived, seen their gravestones up in the little church overlooking the fields in Haigh, and it gives me the strangest, lurching feeling to see there on my computer screen Sarah Lucinda Ferguson born in the first quarter of the year 1886, page 42 of volume 8c, her name nestled between Thomas Connolly and Abel Larkin. My granny knows little of her grandparents; she was a late baby, the last of three, and they had died by the time she was born. She knows only that her maternal grandfather was a confectioner, and that her paternal grandfather, John Derbyshire, worked in the mines, while his wife Elizabeth was a housewife. I tap his name into the census website and find 125 Lancastrian John Derbyshires, their household positions variously listed as \"son\", \"head\", \"servant\"or \"boarder\". They are largely coal miners; I do not know which one might be mine. So I try my grandpa's parents: Rosie McCusker was from a large family near Belfast in Northern Ireland (large enough, certainly, for everyone to forget the year she was born). She married Thomas Wilson from Haigh and had two children. He was a clerical worker at the colliery, had been in the Black Watch and later had an accident at work and lost his leg. My mother recalls that in latter years he worked at Addison's off-licence by the station in Wigan and she would help him bottle sherry. But I cannot find him, or his parents, John and Alice Wilson, from Kendal, online, though I know John was a blacksmith who took over the Bridgewater Arms pub at New Springs. In 1841, there were many John Wilsons and Jon Wilsons in Kendal. But I wade through them all and finally fish out the one who is mine. There he is: John with an \"h\", eight years old and the son of a saddler, swimming happily among the Dickenses and Victorias of 165 years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
