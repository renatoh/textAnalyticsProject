He meant \"unthinkable\" but after victories for Middlesbrough and Blackburn Rovers, and a disjointed, panicky performance here, it is time to start conceiving for a club whose Premier League spending is comparable to Liverpool's. There are other figures that sum up Newcastle's situation. One \u2013 the number of home wins in the past four months. Two \u2013 the number of saves the Bolton keeper, Jussi Jaaskelainen, had to make yesterday. Four \u2013 the number of managers Newcastle have been through since their last visit to the Reebok 18 months ago. Forty-two \u2013 the number of players who are still on the club's books. There is also \u00a370m \u2013 the amount of debt saddling Newcastle's parent company. And \u00a3234m \u2013 the amount theoretically owed to the owner, Mike Ashley. This ought not to have been a decisive weekend for Newcastle but it is the games that are to come that ensured this defeat sent a sliver of fear along the Tyne. Three of Newcastle's next four matches pitch them against Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea at St James' Park, while their final two away games are at Liverpool and Aston Villa. Although, historically, their home record against Arsenal and Chelsea is reasonably good, Newcastle's survival might come down to winning their six remaining matches \u2013 away to Hull, Stoke and Tottenham and at home to Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and Fulham. \"What smacks you in the face is when you look at the games we have to win,\" said Newcastle's caretaker manager, Chris Hughton. \"A lot has been spoken about the three home games we have against the big teams but the matches away from home are now equally as important. They are all tough. If you ask me if I would prefer not to play Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea, then the answer is yes. But what you can say in our favour is that we would rather be playing these fixtures at St James' Park.\" Newcastle's failure to score from 23 shots shows the extent to which they miss Michael Owen. Hughton is due to remain in charge until Joe Kinnear's return from heart surgery on 11 April, although the manager will be tempted to come back to the dug-out sooner. Had he been at the Reebok, Kinnear would have made far more of Alan Wiley's decision not to award a penalty for a clear handball by Jlloyd Samuel in a second half that Newcastle increasingly dominated without having the edge to force a breakthrough. When Hughton brought off the increasingly ineffectual Obafemi Martins, who had squandered two clear opportunities before the interval, those Newcastle fans who earlier had taunted Peter Reid \u2013 for his time with Sunderland rather than his record as manager of Thailand \u2013 and whose executive box was directly behind them, turned their derision on Hughton. There was a time, not very long ago, when this treatment was reserved for Gary Megson, who for the first time since he was appointed Bolton manager to a chorus of indifference, finally got round to signing a contract. As if to prove it was Megson's day, his decision to replace Fabrice Muamba with Ricardo Gardner was instantly rewarded. Gardner's first touch was unremarkable, his second produced three points as Matt Taylor exploited space down the right flank and cut the ball back to Gardner who as those who had travelled from the north-east would have noted with a weary familiarity, was unmarked. Gardner celebrated by making to fire an invisible arrow \u2013 echoing the celebrations of his fellow Jamaican, Usain Bolt. \"Managers get too much praise when these kind of substitutions work,\" said Megson who has virtually guaranteed survival for a second successive season. \"I was happy to work without a contract and I was still paid but the Premier League insisted I sign one. It's not something I want to dwell on, not with 2.5 million [unemployed] in a far worse situation.\" Man of the match Matt Taylor (Bolton Wanderers)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
