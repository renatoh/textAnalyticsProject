The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, told reporters in Melbourne that the Coag education council had unanimously agreed \u201cthere will be no year 13, there will be no mass repeating\u201d. \u201cEvery student will get an Atar [Australian Tertiary Admission Rank] certificate for 2020, so they can go to university, vocational education, or employment, next year,\u201d he said. The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, welcomed the move, saying it was \u201cnot in anyone\u2019s interest \u2013 neither the students, their parents, the schools or universities \u2013 to stop students from moving on\u201d. In early March, the national cabinet came under intense community pressure to close schools to respond to Covid-19, which it resisted due to expert medical advice children were less likely to transmit coronavirus and closures could last many months. Victoria brought forward school holidays, while other states and territories used pupil-free days to prepare for terms 2 and 3 being delivered through e-learning after the Easter break. In-person attendance has dropped to as low as 5% in New South Wales in the state system, with independent schools moving tuition online and Catholic and public schools scrambling to catch up, amid warnings of a \u201cdigital divide\u201d between schools. Australian universities are changing traditional admission policies to account for the disruption to year 12 students\u2019 studies. On Tuesday, Tehan told year 12 students in a statement that \u201cthe work you will do in year 12 this year is incredibly important and your results will be as valuable as any previous year\u201d. The states and territories will \u201cfollow national principles to support local decisions\u201d \u2013 with each jurisdiction responsible for awarding senior secondary certificates, he said. Tehan told reporters that each state and territory will decide the end-of-year assessment process in their jurisdiction, while the commonwealth will work with the university and vocational education sectors to determine how Atars will be assessed. \u201cWe want this year\u2019s Atar score to look like last year\u2019s Atar score and there is no reason we can\u2019t do that.\u201d Tehan said that primary school posed \u201cchallenges\u201d that put \u201cextra requirements on teachers and require parents to be patient\u201d but teachers will be given resources to teach at all levels. \u201cEveryone is committed to make sure that as much learning as possibly can will take place this year. \u201cCovid-19 is going to take a lot from us. But everyone is determined that it won\u2019t take education away from our children.\u201d Asked if schools will return in term 2, Tehan confirmed the Northern Territory will proceed \u201cas normal\u201d while Western Australia and South Australia are also considering their circumstances. Jackson said that universities use \u201ca wide range of methods to assess and admit students \u2013 in addition to the Atar\u201d. \u201cFor year 12 students, these include assessment of a student\u2019s results across year 11 and 12, especially in the subjects most relevant to the degree the student has applied for,\u201d she said. \u201cUniversities can review portfolios of students\u2019 work and take extra-curricular activities into account. \u201cWhere appropriate, universities use aptitude tests. All universities offer a variety of bridging, foundation and enabling courses to prepare students for university, providing another pathway.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
