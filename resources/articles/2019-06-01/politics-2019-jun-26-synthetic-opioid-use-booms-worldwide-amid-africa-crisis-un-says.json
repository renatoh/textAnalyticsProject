The estimated number of people using opioids \u2013 an umbrella term for drugs ranging from opium and derivatives such as heroin to synthetics like fentanyl and tramadol \u2013 in 2017 was 56% higher than in 2016, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime said in the report published on Wednesday. The report also said that global cocaine production reached an all-time high in 2017, breaking the previous year\u2019s record by 25%, as production soared in post-conflict Colombia. Newly established fields in remote areas boosted production in the world\u2019s top supplier, despite efforts to steer rural communities away from coca cultivation following a peace deal with Farc rebels. The surge in opioid use recorded by the survey to 53.4 million people worldwide, was partly due to more data being available from Nigeria and India. But it also highlighted the scale of the problem despite a drought-related fall in opium production last year in the world\u2019s biggest producer, Afghanistan. Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl continue to be the main cause of opioid overdose deaths in the US, where they rose 13% to more than 47,000 in 2017, further illustrating what Donald Trump has declared a public health emergency. \u201cThe opioid crisis that has featured in far fewer headlines but that requires equally urgent international attention is the non-medical use of the painkiller tramadol, particularly in Africa,\u201d the UNODC report said. \u201cThe limited data available indicate that the tramadol being used for non-medical purposes in Africa is being illicitly manufactured in south Asia and trafficked to the region, as well as to parts of the Middle East,\u201d it said. Seizures of tramadol around the world have surged from less than 10kg in 2010 to almost nine tonnes in 2013 and 125 tonnes in 2017, the report showed, adding that the problem was particularly severe in west, central and north Africa. Several west African countries have reported that tramadol is one of the most widely used drugs for non-medical purposes after cannabis, which remains by far the most popular globally, the report said, adding that reasons for using tramadol vary. \u201cSome consume tramadol for its calming, analgesic and anti-fatigue effects in order to improve intellectual, physical and working performances, and to lessen the need for sleep and decrease appetite,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn farming communities, there are reports of tramadol being used by humans and fed to cattle to enable them to work under extreme conditions. Others use tramadol as a recreational drug on account of its stimulant and euphoric effects, or to improve sexual stamina.\u201d Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
