A Bet365 account in the name of McCann, who was a 19-year-old student at the time, placed a stake of almost \u00a325,000 on 12 horses running in races at Bath, Kempton Park and Naas on 22 June 2016. Bet365 accepted the bets \u2013 a combined total of 960 \u00a313 each-way Lucky 15s \u2013 which were mostly successful and returned a total payout of \u00a3984,833. However, Bet365 refused to pay the winnings, claiming the original stake for the bets had been provided by a third party in contravention of the firm\u2019s terms and conditions. It also refused to refund the \u00a325,000 stake. McCann launched a legal action against Bet365 two years ago and the latest in a series of court dates working towards a full hearing of the case was scheduled for Friday morning. However, the listing was removed earlier this week and an administrator at Belfast\u2019s high court confirmed on Wednesday that McCann\u2019s legal team had lodged an official \u201cnotice of discontinuance\u201d in the case. While punters who have followed the case will be pleased if it transpires that some or all of the \u00a31m winnings have been paid, the news it will not reach a full hearing could also leave a lingering sense of frustration that significant questions about the robustness of a major bookmaker\u2019s T&amp;Cs will not be tested in court. McCann\u2019s statement of claim alleged Bet365 and other leading online bookmakers habitually engage in \u201cunconscionable practices\u201d when dealing with their customers, and that they actively discriminate against shrewd punters who are able to make their betting pay. Many successful punters find it almost impossible to get their bets accepted and their accounts are either closed or, more usually, restricted to stakes of \u00a31 or less. As a result, some are known to resort to using \u201cclean\u201d accounts opened by family members, friends and acquaintances to place stakes on their behalf. Bet365 did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
