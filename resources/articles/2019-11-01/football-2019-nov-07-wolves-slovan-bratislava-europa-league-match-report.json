One point from their two remaining games will send Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s men into the last 32 of the first major European competition that their club has contested for nearly four decades. But the football intrigue was overridden by concern for the Slovan Bratislava midfielder Kenan Bajric, who suffered a serious head injury after being caught by an attempted overhead kick by Jim\u00e9nez just before the goal. After lengthy treatment on the pitch, the concussed Bajric left on a stretcher. \u201cHe will not be coming home with us, he will stay to be observed,\u201d said the Slovan manager, Jan Kozak. Jim\u00e9nez said he prayed for Bajric while on the pitch. \u201cI hope he recovers well,\u201d said the striker. The teams had to put their thoughts for Bajric to one side to complete the game. Sadly for Slovan, Wolves used the additional time to earn victory. For a long time Dominik Greif stalled Wolves\u2019 progress. The goalkeeper turned away everything Wolves could fire at him, including R\u00faben Neves\u2019s penalty in the 51st minute. Jim\u00e9nez finally beat Greif from close range in the second of 12 minutes of stoppage time, heading in a cross from the right by Adama Traor\u00e9. \u201cWe had to be patient,\u201d said Nuno, who praised Greif but lamented his own team\u2019s finishing. \u201cGreif did a very good job but we have to improve,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cWe had chances where we could have done better. We arrived many times to the end line and the action must be finished.\u201d Neves provided the clearest example of poor finishing. Jim\u00e9nez is normally merciless from the spot but he shares penalty-taking duties with Neves and it was the latter\u2019s turn to step up after Pedro Neto was tripped by Vasil Bozhikov. \u201cHe kicked it very bad,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cYou have to give credit to the goalkeeper but it\u2019s the perfect spot to stop it: medium high and slow. Bad! He has to practise tomorrow. A lot.\u201d Slovan, two points behind Wolves going into this game, made it clear from the start that they had not come to play the saps. Wolves were the first to threaten, Neto blasting wide after Traor\u00e9 hurtled down the right. Then Slovan showed their menace but Bajric could not find the target after running on to a corner at the back post. Andraz Sporar had scored four goals in Slovan\u2019s three previous group games and had to be watched closely by a Wolves defence featuring Leander Dendoncker, the midfielder having been reassigned to the right-hand side of the back three owing to Willy Boly\u2019s injury. The Dutchman showed his defensive credentials by sliding in to cut out a dangerous low cross by Sporar in the fifth minute, denying Slovan a tap-in. Greif had to claw away a deflected shot by Jo\u00e3o Moutinho from the edge of the area. Then, as Wolves threatened to take control, Jim\u00e9nez ran on to a wonderfully measured pass by Matt Doherty and lashed a low cross-shot towards the far corner. Greif again reacted well, tipping it around the post. At the start of the second half Wolves got the perfect opportunity for a breakthrough but Neves flopped from the spot. Ten minutes later, with Wolves dominating possession, the goalkeeper was at it again, denying Doherty from close range after a chipped pass by Moutinho. That resistance looked set to endure until Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s late strike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
