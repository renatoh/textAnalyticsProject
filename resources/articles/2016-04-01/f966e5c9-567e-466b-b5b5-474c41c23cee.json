First, though, may I apologise in advance to those readers who concentrate on the actual newspaper, some of whom may be baffled, bored or both, by matters online? Not everyone lives and breathes every moment online. That said, some of these issues go beyond the medium into the realms of not only abuse, but also at times the degradation of an entire trade. And believe me when I say that if journalists want to be degraded, they can do it themselves. I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m frightened or disturbed by online comments, because I\u2019m not. For a start, I don\u2019t see the really offensive ones (which are removed by the hard-working moderators). Moreover, I started out in music journalism, where it was commonplace to field complaints, arguments, even threats, from disgruntled bands, managers, publicists and fans who didn\u2019t take kindly to your estimation that such and such artist\u2019s latest effort was \u201cglorified ear poo\u201d. After that apprenticeship, online nastiness seems very far away \u2013 a background, albeit toxic, hum. What does bother me is that other writers, especially female, gay or from an ethnic minority, may feel intimidated. And why wouldn\u2019t they be? While I haven\u2019t been the target of racist or homophobic abuse, I feel I know a little bit about misogyny. Know it? There have been times when I\u2019ve felt I\u2019ve showered in it, with sexism as my gritty soap and chauvinism my filthy flannel. Then there\u2019s the other more insidious form of intimidation \u2013 the attempts to make writers feel nervous about writing at all, most commonly with the assertion that anything written above the line (ABL) is \u201cclickbait\u201d, written purely to cause outrage and generate web traffic. I\u2019m confused by clickbait. Since when was using the most interesting idea available clickbait? What writer ever declared: \u201cI\u2019ve thought of something really dull \u2013 I must write it immediately\u201d? What editor ever said: \u201cWhat an interesting idea, but you mustn\u2019t write it in case people read it\u201d? No writer, no editor, that\u2019s who. Clickbait is now such a prevalent, dominant term that you\u2019d think you were living in some terrible clickbait era, when it is as it always was. Everything in a newspaper, from war reports to crossword puzzles, has always existed to be looked at by as many people as possible. In this new online era, this means that either everything is clickbait or nothing is. Personally, I listen hard to my comment editor and\u2026 that\u2019s your lot. I think it\u2019s crucial to block out thoughts of any reaction, including online \u2013 neither to court nor be cowed by it. Otherwise, you\u2019re either rising to the bait (Katie Hopkins syndrome?) or you end up being too spooked to write freely, qualifying your thoughts at every turn. Who\u2019s \u201cbaiting\u201d whom anyway? Having largely avoided comments under my columns, I went back for a peek and let me tell you, I\u2019m disappointed in some people\u2019s behaviour. Some commenters only read the headline and comment on that. Others appear to require therapy to get over stuff I wrote ages ago (as the Disney heroine sang: let it go). Others still seem confused that there are usually three unconnected pieces to my column (sweeties, if you ever just once shelled out for the actual newspaper, you might be aware of the layout). Elsewhere, there are accusations about straw men (finding fresh angles is part of a columnist\u2019s job) and people who stereotype you as privileged (amusing, seeing I was dragged up in a council house). Then there are those who appear to view columns like mine as meeting places for misogynists who can\u2019t spell \u201cmisogyny\u201d. And these are just the ones that haven\u2019t been moderated \u2013 lord knows what horrors are lurking beneath those sinister, greyed-out areas. I\u2019m no ABL diva (I don\u2019t want the comments turned off), but I imagine other writers go through similar comment trajectories. At first, flattered (it\u2019s all about me), then cynical (it\u2019s not really about me), then confused (what is this about?), followed finally by resignation and brain blur. You get to the point where you feel that looking at comments is akin to falling down an Alice in Wonderland-style rabbit hole, only with razor blades sticking out of the wall, slashing at you as you tumble down. Surreal, painful and pointless. And while I\u2019m not intimidated, I\u2019m furious that others might be. Nor would I deny a certain level of professional and personal embarrassment. I\u2019m mortified about how hard the readers\u2019 editor and the moderators have to work on my behalf. When I get sympathy from non-journalists, dealing with their embarrassment\u2026 is embarrassing. It says something that I\u2019ve avoided showing my youngest daughter my column online. \u201cThis is Mummy\u2019s job \u2013 being told she\u2019s talentless, stupid, ugly and insane by hundreds of strangers every week.\u201d I bet only sex workers hide their jobs from their children as much as I do. I was shocked when I realised that \u201cproper\u201d journalists (not this music press arriviste) receive similar treatment. This is what I mean by the degradation of a trade \u2013 pretty much everyone getting their work and reputation mauled as a matter of course. Amid all this, the crucial point that too rarely gets a mention is that, love them or hate them, hacks put their names to what they write. While I\u2019m not against pseudonyms, there\u2019s a dark irony to watching people with aliases harassing writers who have at least put their bylines where their gobs are. Is it hopeless? No. During my comment reconnaissance mission, under pieces I\u2019d previously avoided, amid the toxic swamp and greyed-out abyss, it was heartening to see a lot of clever, interesting people conversing with one another, sometimes strongly disagreeing with something I\u2019d said, but reasonably, normally, without resorting to insults. Thrilled, I thought: why can\u2019t it always be like this? You tell me. It\u2019s getting ugly in the new battle of the bulge A hotel restaurant in New Zealand has banned Lycra cycling shorts because of \u201cunsightly\u201d bulges, insisting that customers wear trousers. After I\u2019d finished laughing and texting my (cyclist) partner, I was conflicted. Aren\u2019t some cyclists already arrogant enough without hearing their bulges are too large? These types already think they own the roads and pavements. To hear them harp on, you\u2019d think they\u2019d invented physical exercise. The ones who go on mountain rides are the worst, returning radiating such an evangelical smug glow that you would think that Moses himself had descended on to the cycling path to hand over the Ten Commandments. So yes, some cyclists can be annoying. However, who cares if they sit their sweaty bottoms down in restaurants \u2013 and who\u2019s staring so hard at the front anyway? Those shorts are usually padded at the back (to prevent chafing) and, teamed with the helmets, day-glo tops and clunky pedal shoes, they make wearers resemble giant deformed insects. So if someone is choosing to ignore all that, to gawp at the front bulge instead, this may say more about them than it does about cyclists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
