We always have a tape recorder with us so we can get all our song ideas down, whether we're on a bus in London or off somewhere on holiday. If we don't have a dictaphone and we get a idea for a lyric or a tune, we normally have to sing to the answerphone. The only drawback is that people tend to think you're a bit daft if they happen to see you singing on the top of a bus. A luxury: Upgrades on our flights. We got upgraded when we went to New York once and it was great. But what we'd really like is some female backing singers. If the Corrs ever find themselves struggling with their work, we'd be more than happy to have them along with us... A lucky charm: A plectrum. If you've played some memorable gigs with a certain plectrum you tend to get attached to it. There's this one particular pick - a tortoiseshell one - that seems to bring us luck, so it's always kept close by. Amazingly, we've discovered that the small hip pocket in your jeans was actually designed just to hold plectrums. If only: Our own beds. It's not that cliche of living in hotel rooms when you're on the road, it's more the idea of having your own bed on hand whenever you want it and wherever you are in the world. That - or a nice selection of Alan Partridge videos. \u0095 brothernature's new album, Looking Down the Road, is released on Symphony Ray records on April 9. The band are supporting Jimmy Nail on his UK tour in April and May"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
