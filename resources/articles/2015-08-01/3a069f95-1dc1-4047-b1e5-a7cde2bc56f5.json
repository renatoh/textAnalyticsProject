Just three years later, the 19-year-old from north London hopes to face the great Kenyan in the 800m final at the world championships final in Beijing. And within two years, Langford intends to be the best two-lap runner on the planet. Clearly he is not short of confidence. Then again, he is not short of ability either. He won the European Under\u201123 title this summer and at the Anniversary Games last month he ran a personal best of 1min 45.78sec \u2013 a time that puts him 0.01 behind Steve Ovett on the British all-time junior list. And what makes Langford\u2019s achievements more impressive is that he only took up track and field four years ago after regularly getting injured playing football, cricket and rugby. \u201cOne day in 2011 my school needed people to do athletics and I just decided to do the 200m,\u201d he explains. \u201cI did it and then got asked to join a club and it kind of started from there.\u201d A year later he watched the sport properly for the first time at the London Olympics. \u201cI knew who Usain Bolt was, but that was really about it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve raced against Rudisha three times now and [the Olympic silver medallist] Nijel Amos twice. I\u2019ve got a bit of experience of racing against these guys so we\u2019ll just see how much more I can pick up at the world championships.\u201d When asked about how good he can be, Langford does not do qualifiers. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident I can run a lot faster,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look at the race [at the Anniversary Games] I was less than a second and a half behind guys who have run 1:42 this season. It shows I\u2019m in pretty good stead for where my season can end up. It\u2019d be good if I can get a PB and I will give my best to make it through the heat and the semi-finals. For me it\u2019s just a learning curve so one day I can better the guys like Ovett and Seb Coe.\u201d Those are strong words, especially for a runner who is ranked only 60th in the world. But Langford has improved his personal best by nearly two seconds in 2015 and feels there is plenty more to come. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in it to just be a good GB runner or a good world runner,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be the best.\u201d In the past Langford has suggested that he might be good enough to aim for gold at next year\u2019s Rio Olympics, but now he thinks the London 2017 world championships are more realistic. \u201cThat will definitely be the year I\u2019ll go for the gold,\u201d he says. \u201cNext Olympics it will just be about making the final and who knows what will happen, I might surprise myself, but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be happy to make the final. I still think I can get a medal, but it\u2019s about actually doing it on the day.\u201d And in Beijing, if he gets to line up alongside the world\u2019s biggest names, he insists he will not freeze. \u201cIn the call room I sometimes sit there getting my spikes on and just smile,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice being around these guys. And I feel like I was meant to be there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
