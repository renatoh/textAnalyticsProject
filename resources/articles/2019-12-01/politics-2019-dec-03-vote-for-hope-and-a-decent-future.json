We are shamed by extreme levels of inequality, neglect and environmental impoverishment resulting from decades of neoliberalism, in Britain and across the world. We are inspired by growing movements, from Chile to Lebanon and beyond, calling for dignity, accountability and economic justice. People are demanding a future that promises their children decent education, health, jobs and homes, and humane and sustainable solutions to the climate crisis. In the UK, Labour\u2019s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few. Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives have nothing to offer but the prospect of an ever more unequal and divided society, and dog-whistle politics. Between hope and despair, the choice before British voters on 12 December could not be more stark or more urgent.
