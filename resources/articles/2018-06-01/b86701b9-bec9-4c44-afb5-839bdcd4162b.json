London-based Somerset Capital Management (SCM) described Brexit as a risk in a prospectus to a new fund it launched in March, which has been marketed to international investors who want to keep their money in the EU long-term. The disclosure is embarrassing for Rees-Mogg, who works part time at Somerset Capital in addition to his work as an MP. The parliamentarian has repeatedly dismissed the concerns of those worried about the financial risks of Brexit and has argued the UK needs to quit the single market and customs union so the country is not a \u201crule taker\u201d from Brussels. But in reference to Brexit, the SCM prospectus warned: \u201cDuring, and possibly after, this period there is likely to be considerable uncertainty as to the position of the UK and the arrangements which will apply to its relationships with the EU.\u201d The document continued: \u201cAs [the firm is] based in the UK and a fund\u2019s investments may be located in the UK or the EU, a fund may as a result be affected by the events described above.\u201d Rees-Mogg is a non-executive chair at SCM and is paid about \u00a314,000-a-month for working 30 hours a month there. Earlier on Wednesday, he defended the decision by the investment firm to create a new investment fund in Ireland. \u201cA number of existing and prospective clients requested domiciled access to Somerset\u2019s products,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cThe decision to launch the fund was nothing whatsoever to do with Brexit.\u201d Rees-Mogg said that SCM had funds based across the world and that \u201cpeople outside the EU are used to Irish domiciled funds\u201d. The warnings in the prospectus, he said, were \u201cnot a policy statement by SCM\u201d, but guidance to investors that was drafted by lawyers. He has complained about \u201cendless scare-stories about project fear\u201d. In February, he was a signatory to a letter to the prime minister, Theresa May, demanding a hard Brexit that was described by one party colleague as a \u201cransom note\u201d. The MPs chairs the powerful European Research Group, which has consistently sought to put pressure on May to adopt a more antagonistic stance towards Brussels as the UK negotiates its exit from the bloc."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
