That, at least, seems to have been the decision made by My Morning Jacket: once makers of a defiantly backwoods, homespun country rock (they recorded in a silo, their trademark reverb emanating, apparently, from a grain elevator), they've lately decamped, Dick Whittington style, for what must be the musical equivalent of the bright lights of the city. Unfashionably enough, you might think of them as having \"ambition\". Since their great It Still Moves album of 2003 MMJ have certainly been heard in some odd places: in the Dylan biopic I'm Not There, on a major label, and even in the case of new song Highly Suspicious, in strange Robert Palmer-like music. It's an odd, vote-splitting scenario. But while their new LP Evil Urges may confuse, live, this is a band you'll always understand. \u00b7 The Leadmill, Sheffield, Wed 25; Carling Academy Bristol, Thu 26; Academy 2, Manchester, Fri 27 Franz Ferdinand On tour Always a clever bunch, Franz Ferdinand might right now be accused of over-thinking things. In danger of becoming less a band, more a vehicle for frontman Alex Kapranos's renaissance manhood - is he a singer, restaurant columnist, or record producer? - the pressure is undoubtedly on Franz Ferdinand to trump their own performances to date. Duly, having enjoyed pop success with their own unique style (let's call it \"camp Hitler youth disco\"), they've lately decided to move things on to a more adventurous level. Hence, one would suppose, the hiring of Girls Aloud producer Brian Higgins to pep up their game - but with these sessions unsuccessful, obviously a rethink is now in order. Sensibly, they've decided to reconnect with their fan base. Having taken the temperature of the situation at these low-key club gigs, you imagine they'll have a much better idea of where they're headed next. \u00b7 Barfly, York, Sat 21; Adelphi Club, Hull, Sun 22; Thekla, Bristol, Tue 24; Moles, Bath, Wed 25; Orange Box, Yeovil, Thu 26"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
