Umunna announced his decision to join the Liberal Democrats on Thursday, 10 days after leaving Change UK and four months after leaving the Labour party. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable, announced this weekend that he was appointing Umunna as the party\u2019s Treasury and business spokesman. \u201cChuka has agreed to work in the Commons with our business and economy team, alongside Susan Kramer and Chris Fox who speak on these issues in the House of Lords,\u201d said Cable. \u201cHis experience as shadow business secretary will be invaluable to the party in pursuing our shared values.\u201d Senior Lib Dem MPs including Jo Swinson, the frontrunner to be the next Lib Dem leader, and Ed Davey, the other contender in the leadership battle, were quick to welcome Umunna to the party last week. In the hours following his move the Liberal Democrats\u2019 head of membership and engagement reported a surge of 800 new members. In Umunna\u2019s south London constituency this weekend, many of his supporters remain undeterred by his latest political move, including the antiques shop owner Steve Wright, 67, who said: \u201cI think they should just leave him alone. He\u2019s doing a good job for Streatham anyway, so why rock the boat and elect somebody else?\u201d Wright said he did not think Umunna should face a byelection in Streatham as he felt a general election was imminent anyway. \u201cI would probably vote for him because he\u2019s a man of principle. He\u2019s doing a good thing to follow his heart. I think people should vote for candidates based on who they are and what they do, rather than which political party they follow the whip for.\u201d The designer Alex Lamb, 33, said he understood Umunna\u2019s reasons for quitting Labour. \u201cWhat he did was very brave. In my lifetime, it\u2019s pretty unprecedented. At least they [the Change UK defectors] were trying to find the centre ground in a quite fractured time. I think it\u2019s quite admirable that he admitted he made a mistake.\u201d Umunna was elected as a Labour MP in Streatham in 2010, but quit the party to co-found Change UK, in part as a reaction to Labour\u2019s antisemitism crisis and stance on Brexit. He abandoned the new group after they received only 3% of the vote in the EU elections. However, others were incredulous that their MP had been allowed to change political parties twice without resigning. Erica Martin, 42, said: \u201cI think we, as the constituents, should have a say on whether he remains our leader. At the moment the Conservatives are choosing a new leader to be prime minister and it\u2019s the same thing \u2013 we don\u2019t have a say as voters. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear standard of policy for anyone to follow. Where does he stand? It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t know his own mind.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
