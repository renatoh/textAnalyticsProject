Nigeria are currently third-ranked of the third-placed teams, with two more days to sit tight through. Only four go through. Next up, Norway face the runners-up of Group C - Brazil or Australia - in the round-of-16 on Saturday. Here\u2019s the Nigeria 0-1 France report. The feedback on that VAR is not positive. In fact, it\u2019s insurrectional. Evan Crocker: \u201cIt seems a bit absurd to punish a keeper for being two inches off the line when the penalty taker is allowed to dance, jump rope, and even stop for a phone call in the run up to the kick.\u201d Luke Jones: \u201cPlease say something that will make me feel like tedious VAR-check penalties and decisions like the Nigeria goalkeeper moving a foot off the line is not the future of football.\u201d Jon Collins: \u201cA prime example of why I dislike VAR a lot in the absolutely inevitable awarding of that penalty there; a good three momentum-killing minutes (that won\u2019t be added on) of pissing about because the ref is reluctant to give an obvious pen without the advice of a video assistant. Not a fan.\u201d Soluna Mar: \u201cI understood the guidance of VAR use was a clear and obvious error. If it takes several minutes for an official to review and take a decision doesn\u2019t that make it inherently not obvious?\u201d Dave Seare: \u201cBut she moved in front of the goal line on the re-take too! I\u2019d have just sat down for the second one.\u201d VAR is the story - again - and Nigeria\u2019s World Cup hangs on that infringement by Nnadozie that meant a weak penalty could be taken again. The Nigerian goalkeeper is utterly devastated and has to be helped up by her teammates. France break through Henry, but Chikwelu delivers a most tactical of foul on Geoyoro. She accepts the yellow card, her second of the World Cup. Should Nigeria get through, she will miss the next match. An injury to Geoyoro only prolongs the match, which nears its 100th minute. Norway are through in second, but can Nigeria find a goal that might cement a third-placed qualification for the last 16? They have a free-kick in a dangerous position, but one easily cleared. Oh! South Korea go so close to an equaliser. Yeo\u2019s header just goes wide when at last, the Norway defence had been breached....but that\u2019s that. Norway are through. South Korea have been granted just three extra minutes to find two goals. It seems unlikely. Not surprisingly, there will be eight minutes added on in the Nigeria-France game. That\u2019s VAR for you. Norway are hanging on so grimly that substitute Saevik is the lone player up front when the ball is cleared. She manages, to her credit, to force a corner. They now indulge in a bit of corner-hogging, keeping the ball down by the corner flag. France make a final change. Off comes Thiney, who blew a couple of decent chances, for Geyoro, the 21-year-old. South Korea chance! Ji\u2019s quick thinking steals the ball and Lee has the space to fire a shot at goal that was heading in had goalkeeper Hjelmseth not got her hands to it. Nigeria, who may be heading out after conceding that goal (they might have to get the abacus out), have made a double change. Ordega limps off with what looks a hamstring injury, while Oshoala also goes off. On come Nwabuoku and Imo. Clare Lawrence emails in, and I have to agree: \u201cThis VAR review of minor penalty infringements by goalkeepers is over governing the game. Poor use of the VAR given that the early movement had no impact on the miskick. Agreed with the penalty, disagreed with the redo.\u201d By the way, that France penalty farrago took a full six minutes. Renard can count herself very lucky that she got a second bite of the cherry. The goalkeeper was even booked for her movement. That\u2019s to the letter of the law, of course, but bloody harsh with it. Well hello there, a lovely flick from Lee in midfield and then Ji slots home. It\u2019s the least they have deserved. This time, Reynard roofs it, and the goalkeeper cannot move to save it. Oh no! Nnadozie has been shown to have moved before the penalty was taken and missed. Oh, that\u2019s harsh. Two goals in their first game, an own-goal in the next game, and now a dreadfully casual penalty. She hit the post. And all while Le Sommer was on the field... Another Renard header drifts over for France, but an infringement goes against her...what\u2019s this? France want a penalty and VAR is in session. Asseyi is baulked by Ebere. The ref missed it, but now she gets a look at the screen. As the last man/woman, Ebere has to receive a second yellow. Roger Wallace emails in: \u201cI\u2019ve been following your world cup coverage and just had a thought: in the (admittedly unlikely) scenario in which Nigeria not only continue to hold off France but actually score one on them, how would the group winner be decided, as Norway and France would be even on points and GD? Obviously away goals is not a thing.\u201d From wiki: The ranking of teams in the group stage is determined as follows:[37] Points obtained in all group matches (three points for a win, one for a draw, none for a defeat); Goal difference in all group matches; Number of goals scored in all group matches; Points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question; Goal difference in the matches played between the teams in question; Number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question; Fair play points in all group matches (only one deduction could be applied to a player in a single match): Yellow card: \u22121 point; Indirect red card (second yellow card): \u22123 points; Direct red card: \u22124 points; Yellow card and direct red card: \u22125 points; 8 Drawing of lots. Much of South Korea\u2019s life seems to have drained from them. A Norway goal looks more likely but they have just missed a big chance through Saevik, on as a substitute. France subs: Cascarino off for Le Sommer and Gauvin off for Diani. With Nigeria pinned back and needing to score five goals, it looks as if Norway are dead set for second place in Group A. What a miss from France! Cascarino gets down the right-hand side, and her vision allows her to find Thiney in open space. The finish is poor, with the shot drifting well wide of the post. Wasteful again. Over in Rennes, France continue to mount pressure without looking capable of scoring. They seem to lose the run of themselves once the goal nears. And meanwhile, Graham Hansen will not be risked any further. She looks in some pain and there look to be tears in her eyes. Norway\u2019s injury list is piling up. Graham Hansen can\u2019t take the penalty herself, as she is getting her sore ankle iced off the field. Up steps Herlovsen to take and she hits it low. The goalkeeper gets two hands to it, but the ball squeaks into the back of the net. Korea\u2019s World Cup looks to be over. Graham Hansen is fouled by Kang and that looks a plum penalty. Peter Campbell emails in: \u201cIn the replays I saw, I didn\u2019t see any contact between Gauvin\u2019s foot and the Nigeria player\u2019s face. Did you see any contact? If not, the defender seemed to have sold the ref on the card and I wonder whether VAR would get involved in such decisions?\u201d It did look a harsh yellow, but I wonder whether yellow cards can be overturned. A high kick is still dangerous play even if it doesn\u2019t count. Three teams here don\u2019t mind matters finishing as you were, while it is South Korea who need things to change. They have 45 minutes to save themselves. France almost begin their second half with another Renard goal, but this time her header is wide. The hosts have gone at it from the whistle. We are back underway... That early penalty separates the teams, but it is Korea, who need a win and for other results to go their way, who have been the team in the ascendancy. France have been unconvincing, it has to be said. France\u2019s Valerie Gauvin is booked for a high kick when trying to get perform an overhead in the Nigerian box. The crowd boo that one, but it was a little wild. Korea\u2019s Ji has another sighter for a free-kick, and again, it\u2019s over the bar. A clash of knees between Chikwelu and Bibault, with both players high in the challenge, but both will be OK to carry on. A drop-ball is awarded as neither was worse than the other. Oof, close for France! Cascarino wins the ball in midfield, surges on, and then whips a pass into the box. Gauvin, who had to improvise, got her heel to the ball but not on target. China and Spain both made it through after a game the Spanish might have won. Oof, nasty clash of head in Reims where Norway keeper Hjelmseth took out teammate Mjelde when reaching for one of those high Nigerian balls. Thankfully, after a bit of treatment, Mjelde is OK to carry on. Justin Kavanagh emails in: \u201cThe game is Rennes is a fine clash of couture between the African chic arrowheads and neon green shirts of the Nigerian strip and the classic French unadorned navy elegance of Les Bleus. BTW Neither Delphine (nor her twin sister Estelle\u2014also a player) Cascarino are related to Tony Cascarino, despite being born at the time when the Ice Cream Man (as forgetful Jack Charlton used to call him) was a player in France.\u201d When \u2018Cas\u2019 used to play for Gillingham, I used to think it highly exotic that they had an Italian playing in the Third Division. When Marseille flopped after their corruption scandal, it was Cas replacing Jean-Pierre Papin and the like. France have not been too impressive here, but their corner count is mounting. Okeke has been the pick of Nigeria\u2019s defenders on these set pieces and gets the ball clear. Sadly, Nigeria\u2019s chance of a break fails after a poor cross to the back post. Yet another Korean corner after Ji, of Chelsea, forces some evasive action from the Norwegians, who have been weathering the storm. The ball makes its way to Moon, the striker, but her shot is seemingly aimed at her namesake and flies way over the bar. Yellow card for Nigeria after Ebere is booked for a foul on Cascarino. Yet more pressure from the Koreans, who force another corner. Yet again, it comes to little. Nice flipped ball by France\u2019s Bibault just evades Thiney. The French really pushing for the win that would give them maximum points. And with those rotations, some will be looking to impress manager Corinne Diacre for the latter stages. South Korea win a free-kick in a decent position, but Ji\u2019s somewhat weak attempt - straight into the wall - was a waste. Norway under some pressure but the Koreans yet to find the last pass or shot to get back into the game. Germany cruised through to the next round and looked menacing in one of today\u2019s earlier games. Another chance for France as Henry makes the time and space to flash in a shot. It goes wide. Lovely skill to make the chance, less so the finish. They have been..excitable in front of goal. Yes, a Norway chance soon comes on the counter, and Herlovsen looked likely to score, only for a decent save from the foot of Nnadozie in the Nigerian goal. Gauvin flashes a header over for France. They have created plenty of chances this tournament, but are blowing far too many of them. The Koreans are playing for their lives here, keeping up the pressure though are in danger of leaving too much space at the back. France are making heavier weather of the first ten minutes, but the momentum is with them. Cascarino forces a corner, their second of the match. Renard is the target after those two goals in the opening match, but this time the ball goes back to Asseyi, who fails to get much purchase on her shot. Norway are chasing another in quick succession, forcing another corner. Thorisdottir comes up for it again, having been manhandled for the penalty. It reaches Mjelde this time but she heads over. As it stands, Norway will take second in the group, and the French will top the group. Four points should be enough for the Nigerians to go through in third, too. Hansen steps up and slots home, but only just. That\u2019s the earliest penalty in tournament history, and the earliest goal of this tournament. A mountain to climb for the Koreans. From a corner, Thorisdottir is fouled in the box, the ref has no hestitation in awarding it. As might be expected in Rennes, France begin on the front foot, with plenty of noise behind them, too. Nigeria, though, force an early corner. They take their time over it, and the French goalkeeper, Bouhhadi, flaps at it. With only France assured of their destiny, and even then not quite sure of winning their group, there is plenty to play for. All four teams are in the tunnel and it has to be said that the Nigerians\u2019 sing-song entry to the stadium took the eye. It\u2019s very loud in Rennes, perhaps a bit less so in Reims but that\u2019s always the way when the hosts are playing. The Marseillaise is pretty damned loud. Those teams from Reims in more readable fashion. South Korea: Kim, Lee, Shin, Kim, Jang, Kang, Ji, Cho, Lee, Yeo, Moon Subs: Kang, Jeong, Hwang, Lim, Lee, Jung, Kang, Lee, Lee, Kim, Jung, Son Norway: Hjelmseth, Wold, Mjelde, Thorisdottir, Minde, Hansen, Risa, Engen, Reiten, Utland, Herlovsen Subs: Hovland, Hansen, Thorsnes, Fiskerstrand, Asland, Eikeland, Maanum, Redisch Kvamme, Haavi, Saevik, Nautnes, Bogstad Referee: Marie-Soleil Beaudoin As expected and predicted, France have shuffled the pack, with four changes, including leading striker Eugenie le Sommer dropping to the bench along with Marion Torrent, Kadidiatou Diani and Elise Bussaglia. Eve Perisset, Charlotte Bilbault, Delphine Cascarino and Viviane Asseyi come in. Nigeria have made just one change, and that\u2019s midfielder Halimatu Ayinde, replacing Chinaza Uchendu. The Nigeria v France team news in more readable fashion. Nigeria (4-3-3): Nnadozie, Okeke, Ohale, Ebi, Ebere, Ayinde, Okobi, Chikwelu, Ordega, Oparanozie, Oshoala Subs: Oluehi, Okoronkwo, Nwabuoku, Imo, Uchendu, Kanu, Ajibade, Ihezuo, Jonathan, Ogebe, Chukwudi France (4-4-2): Bouhaddi, P\u00e9risset, Mbock Bathy, Renard, Majri, Cascarino, Henry, Asseyi, Bilbault, Gauvin, Thiney Sub: Durand, Torrent, Tounkara, Karchaoui, Geyoro, Le Sommer, Diani, Laurent, Bussaglia, Peyraud-Magnin, Debever, Clemaron Referee: Melissa Borjas And the teams for Nigeria v France. Here\u2019s the teams for South Korea v Norway. And for the match in Rennes. While we wait for the teams, here\u2019s the team guides for tonight\u2019s match in Reims. After Group B went first, it\u2019s Group A\u2019s turn to face the final curtain. With the hosts France already through, their task is gain a draw from Nigeria in Rennes to make sure they top the group and that they face one of the third-placed teams in the last 16. Nigeria are third in the group, and having lost to Norway last time out, need a result to force themselves into that third-place picture, with their goal difference being three goals inferior to the Norwegians, who must be expected to beat South Korea in Reims. The runners-up play the second-placed team in Group C, which looks likely to be Brazil. A draw would probably be good enough for both Nigeria and Norway. They could even lose and go through. Confused? You probably will be. It\u2019s times like this that are an argument for a 32-team (or even 16) tournament. What we do know is that only a win will be good enough for the Koreans. It might be expected that Corinne Diacre, the France manager, might make some rotations for tonight. The hosts have looked decent so far and have caught the public\u2019s imagination.
