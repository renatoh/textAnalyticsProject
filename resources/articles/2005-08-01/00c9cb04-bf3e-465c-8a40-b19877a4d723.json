Mounir el Motassadeq, 31, a Moroccan, was cleared, however, of abetting mass murder. He is one of only six men worldwide to have been tried or have trials pending in connection with the attacks on America in 2001. At his first trial, Motassadeq was convicted on all charges and given the maximum 15-year sentence, but an appeal court overturned the conviction, saying he had been unfairly denied evidence from al-Qaida suspects held in the US. His defence lawyer said yesterday that he would appeal against the latest verdict, which he described as a \"semi-acquittal\". Prosecutors at Hamburg state court had demanded 15 years in jail for membership of a terrorist organisation and being an accessory to thousands of murders. But Judge Ernst-Rainer Schudt said the second charge was not proven. He said Motassadeq was a lower-tier member of the group of radical Arab students led by Mohammed Atta, the man who rammed the first hijacked plane into the World Trade Centre. The evidence suggested that terrorist chiefs who assessed the group's members at an Afghan training camp had rejected Motassadeq for a leading role. \"Our impression is that he was too lightweight for this task,\" Judge Schudt told the court. \"He wasn't the same calibre as Atta.\" The outcome of the trial hinged largely on evidence from captured al-Qaida prisoners, which United States officials withheld from Motassadeq's first trial and made available only in limited form at his retrial. The case, which was complex at times, strained Berlin's relations with Washington as it tested how far the US was willing to go in providing sensitive evidence. The US declined, on security grounds, to let the court question three captured al-Qaida prisoners being held at secret locations, including a key member of the Hamburg cell, although it did hand over summaries of statements they had made under interrogation. \"The point is we would have liked to have questioned them ourselves,\" said Judge Schudt. The prisoners' statements did not constitute \"sufficient proof in either direction\", he said, and there was no way to check their veracity or to decide whether the information had been extracted under torture. He called this \"an unsatisfactory situation\". The judge said that under a \"division of labour\" inside Atta's group, Motassadeq played an important role in running the financial affairs of other cell members and covering up their absence from Germany while they were preparing the operation that killed nearly 3,000 people. He said Motassadeq must have known that Atta and the others were planning attacks using planes in the US, but there was no evidence he knew precise details of the plot. \"A general knowledge or an inkling\" was not enough to prove he was an accessory to thousands of murders, he said. The verdict came as a relief to the German government after previous failed prosecutions, including the acquittal of another man, Abdelghani Mzoudi, on the same charges. \"That a terrorist linked to the 9/11 attacks has now been convicted is proof that Germany is fighting Islamic terror with efficiency and success,\" said Otto Schily, the interior minister. Dominic Puopolo, from Florida, whose mother died on September 11 and who joined the trial as co-plaintiff, said he was ecstatic at the conviction, but added that he would consider appealing against the acquittal on accessory to murder charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
