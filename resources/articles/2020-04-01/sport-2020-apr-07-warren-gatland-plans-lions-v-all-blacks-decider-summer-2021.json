Gatland, who led the Lions to a series draw against the All Blacks in 2017, believes the match could generate \u00a35m and revealed he has held discussions with the New Zealand Rugby chief executive, Mark Robinson. The former Wales head coach has been pushing for a warm-up match for the Lions before they head to face the world champions as next year\u2019s series has been condensed to eight matches over five weeks rather than 10 over six, as was the case three years ago. The Lions have been in talks over facing the Maori All Blacks, while Japan and the Barbarians have been considered as other potential opponents, but Gatland believes that with unions around the world taking a huge financial hit because of coronavirus \u2013 NZR has forecast losses of around \u00a350m \u2013 the All Blacks would be the ideal candidates. The match would be slated for the same weekend as the Premiership final, scheduled for 26 June, but still at Twickenham \u2013 either the day before or after \u2013 while the Principality Stadium and Murrayfield are other potential host venues. Gatland, who is coaching the Chiefs in New Zealand, told Sky Sport NZ: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Mark Robinson about a warm-up game for the Lions and he was potentially talking about the New Zealand Maoris. But is it something that the All Blacks go up there for? A decider before we go off to South Africa at the end of June next year. \u201cPotentially it\u2019s an opportunity to make \u00a34m or \u00a35m from a game like that and put some money back into the coffers that we\u2019re going to need.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
