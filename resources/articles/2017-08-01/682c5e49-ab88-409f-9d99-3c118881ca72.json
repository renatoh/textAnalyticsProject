Growing up in France after moving there from Benin as a four-year-old, the budding striker idolised Didier Drogba and dreamed of emulating the Ivorian. So he was thrilled when Huddersfield recognised his talent and paid \u00a311.5m, a club-record fee, to prise him from Montpellier in July. At Selhurst Park Mouni\u00e9 and his new club introduced themselves to the Premier League in spectacular style, the striker producing two emphatic finishes to crown a triumphant individual and collective performance. \u201cNow people know who I am. I couldn\u2019t imagine a better start. It\u2019s a big confidence boost,\u201d said Mouni\u00e9 before revealing his long-held admiration for Drogba \u2013 and also for Christian Benteke, the Crystal Palace forward who enjoyed the opening day of the season rather less than him. \u201cMy idol is Drogba,\u201d says Mouni\u00e9. \u201cSometimes I just watch video clips of him, scoring goals over here. I think I have a similar style with him. I\u2019m big like him. Benteke as well, who is a great striker. I have to learn off them.\u201d \u201c What [Drogba] did here is an inspiration to me. He is also African and we almost have the same story. He was born in Africa and came to France and then to England. I will try and follow in his footsteps. He is a great player and man. I\u2019ve never met him but maybe I will in the future.\u201d Mouni\u00e9 has a long way to go if he is to follow in the footsteps of a player who won four Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League during nine years in English football but one cannot fault his ambition. And he has a head start on his hero, who was 24 when he moved from a Ligue 1 club, Marseille, to Chelsea in 2004. Mouni\u00e9 is 22. At 6ft3in the Benin international is also a tad taller than Drogba and he demonstrated his aerial power when scoring his first goal in the Premier League, an unstoppable header that put Huddersfield 2-0 up against Palace after Joel Ward\u2019s own goal had given the newly promoted team a deserved lead. He also showed his aerial strength in defence, heading clear corners at the near post just like Drogba used to do. And he then confirmed his clinical shooting by firing into the net to crown Huddersfield\u2019s victory when Palace were threatening to get back into the game. \u201cFor this year he has to confirm and make further steps but we should not forget he\u2019s 22, still very young, has a lot of space to improve,\u201d said David Wagner, the manager whose many qualities include an ability to recruit shrewdly. \u201cThe arrival of David Moss as Huddersfield\u2019s head of football operations in the summer has strengthened that ability and it was the former Celtic scouting expert who first mentioned Mouni\u00e9 to Wagner. \u201cThe good thing is that he isn\u2019t only a goalscorer, he is also a very good character, open-minded, who likes to learn and who likes to work,\u201d continues Wagner. \u201cThis, altogether, can give you everything you need to become a proper striker in the Premier League.\u201d Huddersfield under Wagner are a proper team, every player well chosen and well attuned to the manager\u2019s pleasingly bold approach. That was already clear from the way they played their way out of the Championship and, at Selhurst Park, it meant they compared favourably with a Palace side that struggled to adapt to the style cultivated by Frank de Boer, the newly appointed manager whose first match could hardly have gone much worse. Most tipsters make Huddersfield certainties for relegation but Wagner and his players are justifiably confident that they can confound the prophets of doom, as they did last season. \u201cI know that we have a real chance to stay up,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cI knew this before this game. We are in the Premier League and we have a real chance and it\u2019s up to us what we do out of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
