Three official teasers and trailers of season four have been forensically dissected, while shots of the shoot were gobbled up more than a year ago. This is in part because this season focuses on the 1980s, a time many of its core viewing demographic remember well; and in part because this season features the looming figure of Margaret Thatcher, played brilliantly by Gillian Anderson. But mostly, it comes down to the anticipation of seeing Emma Corrin as the young Diana. And while the series continues to revolve around the life of Queen Elizabeth, in this season \u2013 which lands on 15 November \u2013 she\u2019s eclipsed by Diana. On Netflix, as in real life. The Crown is not a documentary, of course: it\u2019s the fictionalisation of what feels like the world\u2019s longest running soap opera, compressed and magnified for maximum drama. And this season \u2013 The Windsors: Dynasty edition \u2013 has it all: the drama behind the royal engagement and that unforgettable wedding in 1981; the revelations of some disturbing Windsor family secrets; conflict between the Queen and Thatcher, and the brutal implications on British society \u2013 and the world \u2013 as Thatcherism unfolds. But if you\u2019re after the really good stuff, skip ahead to episode six, Terra Nullis, which focuses on Charles and Diana\u2019s 1983 six-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. It was a pivotal moment in real life, just as in the series. For the royals, the tour was to be all about Charles as heir apparent in a Commonwealth country with which he had strong links, and a show of strength to Australians who had begun to question the need for a monarchy. The Whitlam dismissal by the Queen\u2019s representative, Sir John Kerr, had taken place eight years earlier (a move Charles had privately endorsed), and the then recently elected prime minister, Bob Hawke, was pushing for a republic. For the couple, it was their first official overseas tour together. They\u2019d been married for two years, baby Prince William was on his first public outing (at Diana\u2019s insistence, and against royal protocol), and the strain between them had well and truly set in. For Australians who were there for it, episode six is great nostalgia. See the royal couple wilting in the Northern Territory heat; mobbed by crowds in Brisbane, and at the Sydney Opera House; joking around at a charity dinner in Tasmania. Spot Diana\u2019s iconic 80s outfits and recall the bullish Hawke \u2013 played by veteran Hawke actor Richard Roxburgh with collar-tugging, smirking gusto \u2013 scoffing at their appeal. It\u2019s also a sweet reminder that this couple were once enamoured with each other \u2013 when he twirled her awkwardly across the dance floor at a charity ball at the Sheraton Wentworth Hotel, when they held hands and laughed happily together in public, against an Australian backdrop. Things might have been fraying behind the scenes, but it\u2019s lovely to remember that on this tour they were the dream team trying to make it work while letting us indulge in our happily ever after fantasies. Before the carefully spun fairytale was dashed, and reality tragically intervened. As the episode shows, the 1983 Australian tour was the making of the then 21-year-old Diana: a demonstration of her star power, as well as her own realisation of that strength. This was apparently a surprise for the other royals, not least Charles who was both proud and perplexed when he realised that his wife was outshining him. According to Tina Brown\u2019s The Diana Chronicles, when Charles turned up to a tour function alone, he told crowds: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair is it? You\u2019d better ask for your money back!\u201d Even Hawke realised he would have to shelve his republican plans when he saw the Australian public\u2019s devotion to Diana. It also shows that the seeds of destruction of their marriage had already taken root: Prince Charles\u2019 much reported jealousy at being eclipsed by his young wife, the heartless way he treated her as she struggled, and their mismatch as a couple. We see the immense pressure Diana was under to live up to the public\u2019s image of her as \u201ca fairytale princess\u201d, and the toll this took on her mental health and in her battle with bulimia, the illness that she would later help to de-stigmatise by speaking out about it. So come for the drama, the 80s fashion, the recreation of so many unforgettable moments \u2013 but stay for the reminder that no one really knows what\u2019s going on behind closed doors for public figures, that scrutiny takes its toll, and that ultimately fairytales are complete nonsense. The Crown\u2019s fourth season arrives on Netflix on Sunday 15 November. The Guardian\u2019s full review will run Sunday in the UK, Monday in Australia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
