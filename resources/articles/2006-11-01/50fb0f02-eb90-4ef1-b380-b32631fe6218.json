The good news is you don't need an \"ology\" to start saving - you just need broadband. Skype is one of the many companies enabling phonecalls over the internet, otherwise known as Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP. In essence, all these companies do is to use the existing broadband network to route voice calls through - and all you have to do is download their software application to your computer. Free calls only apply to fellow users of the same VoIP service as you, be it Skype or your local supermarket - and to receive a call the person you're ringing has to be online at the same time the call is made. Phoning ordinary landlines and mobiles worldwide using VoIP isn't free, but at around 1p a minute, the savings are still huge. But unless you want to be stuck with a kind of Instant Messenger text service, you'll need either a headset or VoIP phone that plugs into your computer's USB port. If you've got a webcam, you'll also be able to chat face-to-face. Chargeable options include voicemail and having a Skype phone number that can receive calls from regular handsets. There is no provision for 999 calls, though, so don't tear up your landline contract just yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
