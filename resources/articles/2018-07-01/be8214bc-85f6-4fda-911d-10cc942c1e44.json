Their rivalry may well become the defining battle of this generation but it clearly does not weigh heavily with Vettel. Just how composed he is could not be better illustrated than when this intensely private man proves happy to talk about his life away from the wheel. Something that perhaps helps define why he has been so successful behind it. Vettel goes into Sunday\u2019s British Grand Prix one point clear of Hamilton. Both have four world championships apiece. Both want to be the one to equal Juan Manuel Fangio\u2019s tally with a fifth. Their battle, and how it plays out, will be the dominant theme at Silverstone. It is the second season in a row Vettel has been in a two-horse race with Hamilton and the Ferrari driver understands and revels in the excitement it has generated. \u201cIt is something you want, you want to be in close rivalry,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to be in a position so you can fight for victory, that is the ultimate satisfaction, of course it is more intense when it is closer.\u201d Yet much as this is important to the 31-year-old, he is equally as concerned that behind the intensity, he remains, well, simply, himself. \u201cObviously F1 is a big part of my life but it is not the most important thing. It is not who I am, it is what I do. They are linked but it is important there is a lot of time where it doesn\u2019t define who I am.\u201d Clearly this distinction means something to Vettel, who has enjoyed huge success, with four titles for Red Bull between 2010 and 2013. \u201cI don\u2019t feel special because of what I do for a job. It is part of me, my identity but it would be the wrong answer if I asked myself: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 and I said: \u2018I am an F1 driver.\u2019 I am a lot of other things as well. It doesn\u2019t define me as a person.\u201d At which point he opens up further. He has two children and yes they have been to races but only in the grandstands and not in the paddock. He is focused on them seeing him as who he is rather than what he does. It is the tip of the iceberg in his desire not be changed by F1. \u201cI am happy to do things that people think are boring but for me they are not, being at home, mowing the lawn. I cook, not so good, but from time to time. I do the school run, I go shopping, I take the metro and the bus.\u201d The contrast with Hamilton\u2019s jet-set lifestyle could not be more pronounced but for Vettel pursuing his quiet pleasures seems more important than anything. Visits to the cinema, galleries and museums are all accommodated when possible but he has a blunt appraisal of his fame. \u201cI am sportsman, I am not celebrity. So when I go somewhere and somebody recognises me I think they are interested in sport and not in how I do my hair, or which shoes I am wearing or that bollocks.\u201d He and Hamilton are very much contemporaries. Both made their debuts in 2007 and Vettel is only two years younger than Hamilton, but these past two years are the first time they have really gone head to head in equally matched cars. There is nothing to choose between them this season. The lead has changed hands between them five times in the past nine races and doubtless will do again before it is over. The pair have been open in their oft-repeated mutual respect for one another, and their relationship remains friendly. Their flashpoint in Baku last year when Vettel barged Hamilton has been put behind them. The German now says it was a \u201creaction\u201d which he concedes was wrong, unnecessary, and which he would not repeat. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intending to hurt him, or end his race, or my race,\u201d he says. Vettel has, however, also been accused of too much ambition, leading to errors. This season, his dash at Valtteri Bottas in both Baku and France proved costly as it did on the start in Singapore last year. Yet there is a verve to his driving that can be breathtaking. As it was when he took to the grass to pass Hamilton in Austria. A move similar to his extraordinary overtake on Fernando Alonso round the outside of Curva Grande at Monza in 2011. But he insists he is calm regardless of the situation. \u201cPeople would be surprised. They have the image that drivers under the helmet are all \u2018Arggh\u2019. You have to be calm in the way you drive because it takes all your concentration. But of course I am excited at times and feel the adrenalin.\u201d His battle with Hamilton has been fascinating as has been the apparent determination of both drivers to steer away from attempting to score cheap points from one another. It seems this civilised approach is just another facet of Vettel\u2019s determination to keep his real persona intact amid the sound and fury of the sport. He compliments Hamilton, saying: \u201che has great talent, he has great skill in the car,\u201d but interestingly declines to be drawn on Hamilton\u2019s strengths or weaknesses, simply unwilling for anything to be misconstrued or interpreted in the wrong way. For Vettel, this seems perfectly natural, his consideration a fundamental part of maintaining his balance out of the car, ensuring the intensity, the emotion, the focus is there when required behind the wheel. \u201cI think it\u2019s just normal to be normal,\u201d he says, still smiling, still relaxed as the pressure cooker of Silverstone beckons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
