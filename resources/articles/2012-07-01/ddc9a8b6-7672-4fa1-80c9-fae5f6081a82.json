The \"parfumeur exclusif\" at Herm\u00e8s, he created First for Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Eau Parfum\u00e9e au th\u00e9 Vert for Bulgari. It would, however, be silly to describe him, as Lucia van der Post does on the jacket of his new book, as the Mozart of scent. Ellena has yet to compose a truly exquisite fragrance: a Jicky, a Fracas, an Eau Sauvage. Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez, the unimpeachable authors of the unsurpassable Perfumes: the Guide, remain mostly unimpressed. First is \"humourless\", and the Vert \"hard to love\". Un Jardin sur le Nil (for Herm\u00e8s) is \"shapeless\", and Elixir des Merveilles (also for Herm\u00e8s) is a \"doomed creature\" which \"ages 20 years in as many minutes on the back of your hand\". For them, only his L'eau d'Hiver (for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle) passes muster: \"an elegiac, powdery, almonds-and-water accord that takes its place next to Guerlain's Apr\u00e8s l'Ond\u00e9e and Caron's Farnesiana among the fragrance Ophelias of the world\". Even so, they award it only four stars. The classics all get five. According to Turin and Sanchez, some time after 1976, Ellena caught a \"severe case of minimalism\" from which he never recovered. Alas, a version of this minimalism is very much on display in The Diary of a Nose, in which he tells the story of a year in the life of a perfumer in light spritzes of prose. Not only is his book extraordinarily short (145 half-filled pages, plus a few baffling formulae); it is thin, too, its loopy pretension unable to mask a fatal absence of content. Everyone knows that smells are difficult-verging-on-impossible to describe; such elusiveness is part of the magic of the bottle, the contents capturing sensations far beyond words. But still, you would have thought that Ellena, who began his working life in Grasse at the age of 16, and has been in the industry for almost half a century, might have worked up some effective metaphors down the years. Unfortunately, the best he can do is to tell us that when he was working on Terre d'Herm\u00e8s, he pictured a wooden post driven into the ground against the background of an Irish landscape. Apparently, the post symbolised \"man's presence\" \u2013 which is something you probably won't want to think about next time you swing by the duty free store. It goes without saying that Ellena has an acute sense of smell. \"I can detect and identify all sorts of odours that may be intended to be secret or hidden,\" he writes, noting that a woman on his plane is wearing First by Van Cleef &amp; Arpels in an effort to mask the smell of cigarettes on her clothes. After he has pushed his nose into a bunch of sweet peas, it is the work of mere seconds to jot down the seven components he will need to sketch their indefinable fragrance (it hovers \"somewhere between roses, orange blossom and sweet williams, with their hint of vanilla\"). But spending so much of his time being interviewed by reverential beauty journalists has obviously messed with his head. It's bad enough when he compares himself to C\u00e9zanne. But when he starts describing the \"appropriation spaces\" he leaves in his scents \u2013 \"gaps\" to be filled by the wearer's imagination \u2013 he lost me altogether; imagine Eric Cantona in a lab coat, a vial of blue iris in one hand and a fountain pen in the other, and you're about halfway there. What a wasted opportunity this book is. Couldn't his publisher have insisted he use a ghostwriter? I would have loved to hear more about Edmond Roudnitska, the late, great creator of Diorissimo, a scent based on the smell of lily of the valley (unlike rose or jasmine, lily of the valley cannot be extracted; Roudnitska's genius was to reconstruct it in his workshop). When he writes that, many years ago, Roudnitska told Ellena, his young admirer, to visit only when his clothes no longer stank of washing powder, you sense a fascinating world \u2013 rivalrous and eccentric \u2013 hovering at the edges of the page. But he never sparks it to life. Nor does he engage, except in passing, with the trashy decline of the perfume industry: the primacy of the marketing men, the creation of scents by committee, the disposable smells that hang about department stores for a few years, and then disappear to discount chemists to die. Most pitifully of all, he is unable to pin to the page the sheer joy of scent \u2013 the vistas it opens up, the myriad moods it can alter. I sometimes think I would rather go without supper for a week than forgo my six-monthly bottle of Mitsouko, a perfume which will soon celebrate its 100th birthday. But why? What is its secret? Like Tania Sanchez, I believe that writing about such mysteries \u2013 unpicking them, holding them up to the light \u2013 will only enrich them in the end. Or at least I did until I read Ellena. So perhaps, rather than complaining any more about him, I will quote her instead. After all, no one does it better. Perfume? \"It decorates the day. It makes you feel as though the colours of the air have changed. It's a substitute for having an orchestra follow you about playing the theme song of your choice.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
