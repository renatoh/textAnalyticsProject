A pianist, composer, conductor and, most recently, lecturer at the Royal Academy, her art is a collaborative process: Django Bates, Talvin Singh and Pierre Boulez have all written for her. She spends a good deal of her life abroad, and each trip acts as another excuse to find someone to work with. \"My criteria to work with someone are really rather simple and quite foolish,\" says MacGregor. \"I meet people and I get interested in them, and I ask them to write something for me. Sometimes I meet people and I haven't even heard their music; it sounds risky but I haven't been caught out by doing that yet. Especially with young composers. They may not have been published, they don't have an agent, they don't have backup, they don't have anything on CD, but you know that they're interesting and you know that there is something there.\" MacGregor's loose, intuitive modus operandi comes with a lot of experience. \"I'm trained quite classically but quite freely by my mum, so even when I was little, I had this rather freewheeling approach. When I trained more seriously in my late teens at college, it was: here are the notes, here is what is expected of you. I didn't mind because you need technique, particularly on the piano, which requires a lot of stamina. And it was natural that once I had done that, I would want to go beyond classical music. How can you be yourself if all you do is reproduce someone else's notes?\" MacGregor is currently taking note of non-western music. \"When I visit a country, I really want to find out about the musicians there,\" she says. \"I was in China recently, working with a group of dancers, and was curious to know what pop music they listened to. I always travel with CDs, so I played them Eminem to Miles Davis to African drumming music, and they hadn't heard any of those things, but what they really loved was Nitin Sawnhey's Beyond Skin, and most of all, they loved it when I played them John Cage on the piano. Straight away, they realised that it was a western instrument transformed into an eastern object.\" John Cage's far-reaching visions are the biggest inspiration for MacGregor. \"He's a person who was thought of as provocative and marginal, and turned out to be pivotal. I perform a piece of his called Water Music. On the score there is a minimal amount of things you have to do for piano, but you do have to put a radio on and constantly change the frequency, then you have to pour jugs of water and pick up a pack of cards and throw it down, and it's all notated. Invariably with the radio, it's brilliant because you never know what you're going to get. I got an advert for dandruff shampoo when I performed it. It's very good because it shows you that in classical performance you can only control so much.\" MacGregor's heroes are all maverick characters. \"In any field, I'm drawn to people who are original, but who don't give you this big thing about being a heavy genius - they're not dour. It's a marvellous attribute to be a complete visionary, but have a lightness and humour about what you do. It's a key thing to not be too worried about pleasing people, either.\" This fits Bob Dylan, currently finding favour in MacGregor's CD player. \"I saw Dylan recently, and he was rather like someone from the wild west - I was clearly seeing someone who had been on tour his whole life. He didn't care if you liked it or not, and it was so impressive - what is he now, 60? He was so totally unmanufactured, and you get the sense that he's lived an interesting life. Likewise with Nick Cave and Tom Waits.\" Most important of all, however, is the late Conlon Nancarrow, an Arkansas jazz trumpeter/composer who went off to fight in the Spanish civil war, returning to America to discover that the House Un-American Activities Committee were on to him. \"He went to Mexico immediately and stayed there for the next 50 years,\" says MacGregor. \"And that's when he decided not to write for human beings any more. He wrote for pianola. He started with a series of boogie-woogie studies that are just sensational and wild - as they go on, they get mathematically more complex and they're almost impossible to play. The machine itself becomes touchingly human as it's playing such difficult music: the pianola, a silly instrument really, attains this emotional gravitas.\" MacGregor plays us a CD of herself taking on Nancarrow's first composition, Player Piano Study No 11. It lasts two minutes, and it took him two years to write. \"You would need eight hands to play it, but now with multi-tracking you can do it,\" she explains. \"Pianola operates with a role of paper punched with holes, and Nancarrow punched all the holes himself. I think for later compositions he got a machine that could do it for him. He actually does what Bach used to: all the sets of hands are playing the same thing but at different speeds. I met him once. He looked just like Don Quixote.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
