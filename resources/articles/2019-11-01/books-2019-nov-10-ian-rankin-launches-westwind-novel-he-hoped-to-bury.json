Ian Rankin has revealed that he once disowned his novel, Westwind, and hoped it would \u201cnever \u2026 see the light of day again\u201d. When he first produced the manuscript, 30 years ago, he was told to change it so many times that he started \u201cto lose belief in my abilities\u201d and began \u201cdoubting my future as a publishable writer\u201d, he has said. Only 1,000 hardbacks were printed when it was first published in 1990. \u201cEvery time my agent or editor had asked me to rework it, I had acquiesced, until it felt like it wasn\u2019t really my book at all \u2013 certainly not the one I\u2019d set out to write,\u201d admits Rankin in an introduction to the new edition. \u201cSo I decided it would rest in a dark corner of my consciousness, never to see the light of day again.\u201d The Scottish writer, most famous for creating the Edinburgh police detective John Rebus, says his decision to revisit Westwind was prompted by praise from a fan. After re-reading his \u201clost\u201d book, which tells of life in a fictional contemporary Britain, the writer decided to bring it out again with a few minor changes. \u201cThe characters came to life, the plot was pacey, the villains were scary and the heroes believable,\u201d he said. Orion, the publisher, is to re-release the novel in hardback on 14 November, billed as a tale of spies, satellites and a global conspiracy of sinister surveillance that is \u201cstrikingly relevant in today\u2019s political climate\u201d. Rankin agrees that its concerns about the dangers of political isolationism now seem \u201cprescient\u201d. The novel is set against a backdrop of rising international tensions, as American troops are being pulled out of Europe. Above, in the skies, satellites circle the Earth and are \u201cpotentially being used to spy on everyone and everything\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
