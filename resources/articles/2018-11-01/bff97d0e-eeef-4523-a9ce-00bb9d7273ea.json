The Bank of England said on Wednesday that GDP would have been at least 1% higher in five years\u2019 time if the UK had voted to remain, while an official Whitehall analysis concluded that in all Brexit scenarios, including May\u2019s final deal, the UK would be worse off. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, added that in the worst scenario, an unlikely \u201cdisorderly no-deal\u201d Brexit, the economy would contract by 8%, house prices would tumble by 30% and interest rates would rise to combat inflation. \u201cOur job is not to hope for the best but to prepare for the worst,\u201d Carney said, as he described what could happen if MPs vote down May\u2019s deal on 11 December, and the government and parliament cannot agree on an alternative by next March. The official warnings will lead Jo Johnson, a pro-remain Conservative MP who wants a second referendum, to warn on Thursday that the economic credibility of the Tories was now at stake \u2013 while Brexiters accused the Bank and the Treasury of engaging in \u201cproject fear\u201d. \u201cThe Conservative party\u2019s reputation for economic competence would be undermined by implementing a botched Brexit, especially one that the government\u2019s own analysis suggests will cause economic harm,\u201d Johnson will say. Labour responded by tabling its own Brexit amendment rejecting May\u2019s deal on Wednesday night. Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cLabour will oppose Theresa May\u2019s botched Brexit,\u201d adding that her deal \u201cputs jobs, rights and people\u2019s livelihoods at risk\u201d. The proposed amendment said the party was opposing May\u2019s Brexit because she had failed to provide for a permanent customs union and a strong single-market deal. It would \u201ctherefore lead to increased barriers to trade in goods and services, would not protect workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards,\u201d the text added. May, meanwhile, insisted at a combative session of prime minister\u2019s questions that the country would be \u201cbetter off with this deal\u201d because the economy would still be growing, and accused Corbyn of having a vague Brexit plan of his own. \u201cWhat does Labour have to offer? Six bullet points. My weekend shopping list is longer than that,\u201d May told MPs. May and her leading ministers intend to highlight the advantages of her Brexit deal over the next fortnight, selecting a different issue each day. The idea is to try to persuade sceptical MPs and the British public to back May in the vote on 11 December, which the Conservative chief whip, Julian Smith, confirmed on Wednesday night would take place after six alternative amendments had been considered and following five days of debate. In its modelling, the Bank of England warned that even under May\u2019s deal, described as a close economic partnership with Brussels, the British economy would be at least 1% smaller by 2024 than it would have been under a remain vote in May 2016. Carney denied he was scaremongering and said the Bank was providing an analysis that was demanded by parliament. \u201cWe have to do it,\u201d he said, saying the Bank\u2019s task was to make the forecasts required. Carney did provide some support for the prime minister\u2019s Brexit plan when he said that May\u2019s deal could see GDP increase by as much as 1.75% over the next five years. But he added that the economy was nevertheless in a worse position than it would have been if there had been a remain vote in 2016. But officials also warned there were risks, and that if customs checks on UK-EU trade were introduced \u2013 although without a hard border in Northern Ireland \u2013 that would cause the economy to shrink by about 0.75% over the same period. Angry Brexiters \u2013 many of whom are among the 94 Conservative MPs who have said they would vote down her final deal \u2013 lined up to attack the Bank, the Treasury and other government departments. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the hard Brexit European Research Group, accused Carney of talking down the pound, and failing to understand his role. \u201cHe is not there to create panic,\u201d he said. Hours earlier, a Whitehall analysis, produced for MPs in the run-up to the vote, concluded that the UK would be significantly worse off under five possible Brexit scenarios in 15 years\u2019 time, including the Norway model thought to be favoured by some in the cabinet, and the Canada free trade model favoured by hard Brexiters. Officials did not produce a scenario that matched May\u2019s deal exactly, but the two closest models suggested that the economy would be somewhere between 3.9% and 2.1% smaller in 2035-36 when compared with remaining in the EU. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, conceded that the UK would be worse off regardless after Brexit, saying: \u201cIf you look at this purely from an economic point of view, yes there will be a cost to leaving the European Union because there will be impediments to our trade.\u201d Under the worst-case, no-deal scenario, GDP would be 10.7% lower than if the UK had stayed in the EU in 15 years\u2019 time. Under a Canada-style deal, supported by Boris Johnson and David Davis, the UK would be 6.7% worse off than remaining in the EU, the study concluded. But under a Norway EEA scenario, favoured by some Tory remainers, GDP would be 1.4% lower in 15 years\u2019 time, better than some of the forecasts for May\u2019s deal, although in that model free movement of people from Europe would continue. Officials were forced to compare the economic merits of the Brexit scenarios relative to staying in the EU after the government was forced to accept an amendment from pro-remain Labour MP Chuka Umunna and Conservative MP Anna Soubry in the debates on the finance bill last week. \u201cMinisters were forced today to publish analysis comparing different scenarios to our current arrangements. The data is clear: nothing beats the deal we have as members of the EU,\u201d Umunna said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
