No sooner had the R&amp;A confirmed that unprecedented step in peacetime than golf\u2019s other big three \u2013 the US PGA Championship, Masters and US Open \u2013 issued new dates for 2020 despite the coronavirus crisis. The Ryder Cup also remains in its designated position from 25 September at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin. Royal St George\u2019s, in Sandwich, will still have an Open slot but in July 2021. Martin Slumbers, the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI can assure everyone that we have explored every option for playing the Open this year but it is not going to be possible. \u201cThere are many different considerations that go into organising a major sporting event of this scale. We rely on the support of the emergency services, local authorities and a range of other organisations and it would be unreasonable to place any additional demands on them when they have far more urgent priorities to deal with.\u201d There are also commercial factors. Insiders have confirmed the R&amp;A has a pandemic insurance policy that is almost identical to Wimbledon\u2019s \u2013 cancelled last week \u2013 meaning it will be reimbursed for losses. The R&amp;A\u2019s funding of various grassroots projects will not be affected by a cancellation that ends the Open\u2019s unbroken run since it resumed in 1946 after the war. Mid-September had been cited as the most likely plan B but was ruled out on various grounds, including the fact the school summer holiday will have ended. About 200,000 spectators were expected at Sandwich in July and the R&amp;A will refund those who cannot, or choose not to, attend next year. St Andrews will host the 150th Open, as was always intended, but in 2022 as opposed to 2021. The likelihood is that Royal Liverpool and Royal Troon, initially due to host the Opens of 2022 and 2023 respectively, will each slip back a year. Most notable in a lengthy scheduling bulletin from golf bodies in the United States was a new Masters proposal. Augusta National typically hosts the year\u2019s first major in early April. The Masters now has \u201cintended dates\u201d of the week commencing 9 November in what would mark an historic shift. \u201cWe want to emphasise that our future plans are incumbent upon favourable counsel and direction from health officials,\u201d said Fred Ridley, Augusta National\u2019s chairman. \u201cProvided that occurs and we can conduct the 2020 Masters, we intend to invite those professionals and amateurs who would have qualified for our original April date and welcome all existing ticket holders to enjoy the excitement of Masters week. \u201cWe remain very mindful of the extraordinary and unprecedented challenges presented by coronavirus around the world. As such, we continue to keep in close contact with local, state and national health authorities to help inform our decisions.\u201d The US PGA Championship, to be held at Harding Park in San Francisco, is now due to tee off on 6 August. This appears optimistic given news from California over the weekend. After Donald Trump projected an \u201cAugust or September\u201d start for sport with spectators in the US, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, asserted: \u201cI\u2019m not anticipating that happening in this state. We have to be careful not to over-promise.\u201d The United States Golf Association simultaneously postponed the US Open, initially scheduled for 18-21 June at Winged Foot in New York, and delivered a revised start date of 17 September. This means the major would be played the week before the US hosts Europe in the Ryder Cup. That biennial joust has thus far been unaffected. The PGA Tour has announced plans to complete its regular season on Monday 7 September, with the conclusion of the Tour Championship at East Lake. \u201cThe Tour will seek to reschedule tournaments into the weeks formerly occupied by the US Open, the Open and the men\u2019s Olympic golf competition in June and July,\u201d it added. It has been suggested the PGA Tour may look to return to competition in June but without spectators. The European Tour will schedule revisions in the coming weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
