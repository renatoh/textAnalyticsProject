The civil servants told the the Times that Corbyn, 70, could be forced to stand down because he was not up to the job \u201cphysically or mentally\u201d. According to the newspaper, the future of the Labour leader was discussed at an event attended by mandarins earlier this month amid suggestions he was \u201closing his memory\u201d. Corbyn said in a statement on Saturday that the briefing given by civil servants against his suitability was \u201csomething that should be very concerning to a lot of people\u201d. \u201cThe civil service has to be independent. It has to be non-political and has to be non-judgmental of the politicians they have a duty to serve. \u201cI would make that very clear if we were elected to government. We have a very clear framework of things we want to do in this country \u2026 We would explain those to our colleagues in the civil service and expect them to carry out those policies. That is the way British democracy must work.\u201d Corbyn also denied suggestions he is considering resigning as party leader due to his health, insisting he is \u201ca very fit, a very healthy and very active person\u201d who enjoys his job. He told ITV News: \u201cThere must be an investigation into which senior civil servants are spreading fictitious information to the press and in the process compromising the integrity of the civil service.\u201d \u201cI think it is a farrago of nonsense that the Times have written. \u201cI think its diminishing of what was once a great newspaper that the front page should be full of tittle tattle from civil servants and people who either don\u2019t know me or don\u2019t understand me. \u201cI love what I do, I love my community and I love being outdoors.\u201d The Labour leader\u2019s comments came after MPs and activists rebutted the report, asserting that Corbyn ran more than 5km several times a week, cycled and exercised at an outdoor gym. Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the Labour MP for Slough, wrote on Twitter: \u201cGive us a break \u2013 where do they get these headlines from! \u201cAlong with his parliament duties, Jeremy Corbyn is campaigning up and down the country, enough to put many of us seasoned campaigners to shame. I see and chat to him almost every week - there\u2019s nothing frail about him.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told Sky News that Corbyn ran every day. Former Ukip MP Douglas Carswell said: \u201cI\u2019d rather have my country run by democratically elected Jeremy Corbyn than the smug, self-regarding, incompetent Whitehall officials that briefed this to the Times,\u201d adding: \u201cGet these vile Sir Humphrys out!\u201d Corbyn has been the MP for Islington North in London since 1983 and became Labour leader in September 2015. In March, Labour said he was receiving treatment at Moorfields eye hospital in London for muscle weakness in his right eye. In a 2017 interview, the Labour leader insisted he had \u201cloads of energy\u201d because he ate porridge and energy bars and avoided meat and alcohol. George Aylett, a Labour activist in Hull, tweeted: \u201cCorbyn goes on 5-7k runs, campaigns up and down the country and there are videos of him rock climbing. I hope I\u2019m that \u2018frail\u2019 when I\u2019m 70!\u201d A party spokesperson said: \u201cJeremy Corbyn leads an active life, running and cycling regularly, and is in good health. Reports to the contrary are scurrilous and a transparent attempt to undermine Labour\u2019s efforts to redistribute wealth and power from the few to the many.\u201d Labour figures also told the Times there was a culture of bullying and intimidation in the leader\u2019s office, with a former cabinet minister alleging there was a \u201cmoral malaise at the top\u201d. The party spokesperson said the allegations were \u201cclearly based on politically motivated anonymous briefings rather than fact. No complaint of this nature has been made through union or party processes, and if they were, they would be fully investigated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
