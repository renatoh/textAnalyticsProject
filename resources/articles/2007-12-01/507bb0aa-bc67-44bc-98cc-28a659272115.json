Ministers agreed to in effect insure about \u00a310bn of commercial loans and offer protection for several other important areas of the bank's mortgage business to head off downgrades in financial status by the main ratings agencies. The move was in addition to the guarantee on retail deposits and the Bank of England loans totalling \u00a325bn that the Newcastle-based bank has received since it almost collapsed in September. Shareholders in the bank saw the move as a sign of further government support for a sale to either Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group or their preferred bidder, the private equity firm Olivant. One of the two activist hedge funds to invest in the bank in the last two months, SRM Global, increased its holding to 9.5%. However, critics of the government's handling of the banking crisis said the move was a step towards nationalisation. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said the government was \"effectively nationalising\" the bank while shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Philip Hammond, called it \"a desperate move by a desperate chancellor\". Some Labour backbenchers said they were concerned that the taxpayer was being asked to accept more responsibility for the bank's liabilities without gaining control of the bank through a nationalisation process. One said he was concerned a backdoor nationalisation was happening \"by stealth\" \u2014 yet it could be scuppered by the shareholders who must vote on any proposals put forward by the board. This week it emerged the Treasury had approached several banks to put together a \"post-nationalisation\" package that would involve their buying tranches of Northern Rock's mortgages. This so called Plan B could allow the government to nationalise the bank for a matter of days or even hours before offloading its assets to a group of UK banks. Banks responded that the extra risk incurred by accepting the debts should be rewarded by ministers backpedalling on a series of reviews into the industry, many of which could curtail the bank's ability to impose charges on customers. A Treasury spokesman denied the move represented a huge extension of support to the bank. \"The previous announcements have created guarantee arrangements for all unsecured retail products of Northern Rock Plc and many of its wholesale deposits and borrowings,\" he said. \"This announcement extends these arrangements to a wider range of wholesale products.\" He said the government was giving support to protect high grade \"covered bonds\" which were \"almost bullet proof\". He estimated the new guarantees would cover only \"hundreds of millions\" of pounds of debt in terms of the risk they posed to the taxpayer. He also said Northern Rock would pay \"an appropriate fee\". The government wants the Northern Rock board to execute a sale of the bank in January before it needs to go back to the money markets and raise further funds. Virgin and Olivant, which is led by former Abbey National boss Luqman Arnold , are equal bidders and are deep in negotiations with the board and the Treasury. Some analysts said they expected the extra support offered by the government would give Northern Rock the foundation it needed to push through a sale in the new year. However, the plan gained only partial support from ratings agencies with Standard &amp; Poor's agreeing to hold its existing A- rating, while Moody's downgraded from D+ to E+. Moody's said it had to downgrade the bank's financial strength after it became clear that efforts \"to find a solution for the stricken British mortgage lender are more protracted than first expected\". S&amp;P said it would keep the bank on credit watch. \"We do not expect the extension of the guarantee to affect Northern Rock's funding profile in the immediate future. Assuming the extended guarantee remains in place following an acquisition, it may assist potential acquirers in refinancing part of Northern Rock's current borrowing from the Bank of England, however,\" it said in a statement. The extension of guarantees means only subordinated and hybrid debt is left uncovered. This is mainly held in the bank's controversial Granite securitisation vehicle which accounts for about 40% of the bank's assets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
