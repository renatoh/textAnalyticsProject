Speculation is rife that she will be unveiled as the new chief executive of Talkback Thames early next week, barring a last-minute hitch. It is believed that Ms Heggessey has offered her resignation to her immediate boss, BBC director of television Jana Bennett. However, Ms Bennett is believed to be making a last ditch effort to persuade Ms Heggessey to stay at the corporation, where she has been running BBC1 for more than four years. One executive close to Ms Heggessey said she had been given assurances from director general Mark Thompson that she could continue to run BBC1 for years to come, but she feels that she should leave on a high and that now is the right time to go. Talkback Thames are planning to make an announcement on Tuesday as to who will replace Peter Fincham as head of one of the UK's largest independent producers next week. A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation did not comment on speculation. Ms Heggessey said last year she wanted to be the longest-serving controller of BBC1 - which would take her to seven years - and she has only been in the job for four years and three months. The longest serving controller was Sir Paul Fox who was there for six and a half years. However, senior BBC staff say that if the right job came along she would be tempted, particularly because she is closely associated with the regime of the former director general, Greg Dyke. Under Ms Heggessey's controllership, BBC1 prospered in the early years of Dyke's regime, with extra money poured into drama, which paid for developments including a fourth weekly episode of EastEnders. BBC1 also benefited in the ratings from his decision to move the Nine O'Clock News into News at Ten's old slot in late 2000. However, BBC1's ratings success brought a backlash, with rival broadcasters complaining that the channel was losing sight of its public service remit in the chase for audiences. In the past year, as the BBC has moved back towards a more public service-oriented programming mix in the run-up to charter renewal, BBC1 has seen its ratings begin to slide. The Talkback Thames job became available last month when Mr Fincham announced that he would be leaving the company in June, after 20 years. Talkback was established by the comedians Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones in 1981, with Mr Fincham joining four years later as a producer. A radio commercials company, it expanded into TV in 1989 and was sold in 2000 for \u00a362m to Pearson, which later merged with Fremantle Media's parent company, RTL. Mr Fincham remained as managing director after the sale to Pearson, then in 2003 became the chief executive of Pearson's entire UK production arm, bringing together the operating divisions of Talkback and Thames TV. He moulded Talkback Thames from an umbrella for disparate niche producers into a production powerhouse, which was responsible for hit shows such as Grand Designs, Da Ali G Show and Smack the Pony. Talkback shows range from mainstream fare such as ITV's The Bill, to edgy comedy such as Monkey Dust and I'm Alan Partridge and BBC1 costume drama The Lost Prince."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
