The walk to Sawgrass\u2019s 17th tee, especially lively on a Friday afternoon, triggers thoughts of impending doom. The green is not, as widely depicted, an island, but the water that all but surrounds it makes this one of the PGA Tour\u2019s most treacherous holes. Recent years have seen a notable increase in heckling \u2013 alcohol-fuelled, typically \u2013 as Players Championship competitors reach the penultimate tee. Sergio Garc\u00eda was a high-profile victim of abuse in 2015. The level of noise that has already surrounded Patrick Reed this season, owing to a penalty incurred during a December tournament in the Bahamas, means it is hardly a leap to fear what he might encounter here. And yet Reed, routinely and somewhat amazingly, has the capacity to block out all discord. Reed answered with a firm \u201cno\u201d when asked on Wednesday whether criticism perturbs him. The evidence backs that up; he won a World Golf Championship in Mexico last month just days after Brooks Koepka publicly questioned his character. Sawgrass holds no fears for Reed. \u201cI think the PGA Tour has done a great job on the security and the fans,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI feel like, as a whole, the fans have been pretty good. You\u2019re always going to get a couple people here and there that are going to say something. That\u2019s normal, in any sport you play. For me, when I get inside those ropes I have a job to do and that\u2019s to go out and play good golf, to have a chance to win on Sundays and to provide for my family and to go out and represent myself the best way I can. And I feel like I\u2019ve been doing that.\u201d According to his own testimony, Reed is instead worried about the potential wrath of Kessler Karain, after events in the annual pre-tournament caddie competition at the 17th. \u201cKessler, it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s actually hit the green,\u201d Reed said. \u201cNormally he hits it in the water. So that means I cannot hit it in the water the next four days because if I do, if I hit in the water once, I won\u2019t hear the end of it until next year.\u201d Reed clearly does not believe altering the narrative around him is entirely within his own control. \u201cWell, winning always helps everything. But really at the end of the day the noise goes away once y\u2019all decide it goes away. I feel like the players and all of us have moved on, but at the end of the day all we can do is go out and continue playing good golf and doing what we\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d In competitive terms, this could be a key year for Reed. He invited some ridicule when classing himself as one of the world\u2019s top five players six years ago. He arrived at Sawgrass ranked No8, with that Mexican success his eighth on the PGA Tour. \u201cIt would mean everything,\u201d Reed said of hitting his top\u2011five goal. \u201cEvery golfer and every competitor that\u2019s out here playing, they\u2019re all trying to get to one spot and that\u2019s to be the best player in the world. All of us are working very hard to win golf tournaments to get to those positions, and the only way you get to top five, top one, or the best player in the world is by winning golf tournaments and winning big events. \u201cAll of us when we\u2019re on, we can go shoot some really low numbers. It\u2019s those days that you\u2019re not, when you don\u2019t quite have it there that you need to kind of be able to turn a three or four over-par round into even or one under. The top players in the world, that\u2019s what they\u2019re able to do. So that\u2019s more kind of where we\u2019re striving.\u201d Reed conceded it should \u201cdefinitely\u201d be easier for him at the upcoming Masters than in 2019, when he arrived at Augusta as the defending champion. \u201cYou feel like your day starts at 6am and doesn\u2019t stop until 7pm,\u201d he said of holding the Green Jacket. \u201cThen on top of it, you\u2019ve got to go out and play solid golf.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
