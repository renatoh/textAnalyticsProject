If an abracadabra goal from the manager\u2019s latest recruit, Gylfi Sigurdsson, 13 seconds into the second half was the best moment, Jordan Pickford\u2019s penalty save on 65 minutes further deflated Hajduk Split. Joan Antoni Carrillo\u2019s team, trailing 2-0 from last week\u2019s first leg at Goodison Park, had brought Stadion Poljud to the boil two minutes before the interval when a thunderous, dipping effort from Josip Radosevic beat Pickford in the Everton goal. The Merseyside club, unbeaten this season, controlled much of the half with another measured, disciplined performance but Radosevic\u2019s effort could easily have unnerved them. Koeman brought on Aaron Lennon at half-time for his first appearance since he suffered mental health problems in the summer. If that cheered Evertonians and neutrals in equal measure, Sigurdsson\u2019s stunning goal on his full debut went further. The Iceland international, a \u00a345m club record signing from Swansea, closed down a loose ball on the right and as he was falling backwards, sent a looping, angled volley over the goalkeeper Dante Stipica and into the back of the net from 50 yards. \u201cI saw Gylfi\u2019s goal, but I don\u2019t think everyone on the bench did. It was incredible. I don\u2019t have any other word for it,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cYou need to be clever to see that possibility and after two or three weeks of the season, it could be the goal of the season [already]. It was really important to be level so quickly in the second half.\u201d It meant Split needed three goals, a tall order against a team as well drilled as Everton, who had only conceded once, at Manchester City, before this game. Yet the hosts should have regained their lead on the night when Ashley Williams conceded a penalty for a clumsy challenge. Ahmed Said won a heated debate about who was going to take it, which did little for an eventual spot kick that was well saved by Pickford. \u201cThe penalty save was key as well because there were still 30 minutes to go at that time,\u201d said Koeman. Everton travel to Chelsea on Sunday and Koeman revealed the Senegal midfelder Idrissa Gueye had been rested with a slight hamstring problem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
