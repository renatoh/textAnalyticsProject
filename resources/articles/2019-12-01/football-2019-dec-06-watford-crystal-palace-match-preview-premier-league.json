Roy Hodgson will be confident his side can maintain their run against managerless Watford who are back in a rut. Seven points from safety could quickly snowball into being completely cut adrift if they do not hire the right man soon. Wilfried Zaha finding form escalates the danger of a fourth consecutive defeat.
