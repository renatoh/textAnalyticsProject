The Munster lock is understood to have been asked to take on the role and he is due to be unveiled at tomorrow's squad announcement at a Heathrow hotel. The Lions' head coach, Ian McGeechan, has made no secret of preferring a forward to lead his side and he will be looking to O'Connell to follow the example of another lock, England's Martin Johnson, who led the 1997 squad to victory over the Springboks. Furthermore, the 1974 tour, the Lions' only other series win in South Africa, was led by another totemic Irish lock, Willie John McBride. Once it became clear that the Wales No 8 Ryan Jones and the England prop Phil Vickery would not be automatic Test starters, the captaincy became a two-horse race between O'Connell and his compatriot Brian O'Driscoll, the centre who led the Lions' ill-fated 2005 tour of New Zealand under Sir Clive Woodward. As the captain who this season helped deliver Ireland's first grand slam since 1948, O'Driscoll can at least console himself that his place in the pantheon is assured. The only reason not to appoint O'Connell would be a concern that the captaincy might take the edge off his game or, conversely, that O'Driscoll performs better when he is in charge of a team. That theory ignores the imposing form O'Connell has shown while at the helm of a Munster team who are likely to provide the backbone of the Lions squad. They would follow O'Connell anywhere in the red of Munster and McGeechan is clearly hoping the same will apply when a Celtic-flavoured Lions squad comes together. To stand any chance the Lions will have to counter the physicality of the Springbok forwards, not least the world's best second-row pairing, Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha. O'Connell did not enjoy the best of tours in New Zealand four years ago but he was far from alone in that respect and the South Africans would be better advised to note his commanding presence in big games this season and brace themselves for the certain prospect of a no-holds-barred challenge in the forthcoming three-Test series. The only minor diplomatic hurdle to be jumped surrounds O'Connell's tart reaction to Warren Gatland's suggestion prior to the Six Nations decider in Cardiff that Welsh players disliked their Irish counterparts. O'Connell and Gatland, the Wales head coach who is a Lions assistant, have subsequently spoken. The Welsh contingent on the tour will find O'Connell a hard but fair presence who will care only about being part of a winning squad. As for the make-up of the rest of the party, it is understood that at least one unheralded name is being seriously considered. Keith Earls, the Munster utility back, has had little exposure at Test level but has been an increasingly sharp presence for his province on their march to the Heineken Cup semi-finals. McGeechan wants players who are finishing the season strongly and Earls' ability to play at outside centre and full-back clearly counts in his favour.Like O'Connell, Earls hails from Limerick and has graduated from the school of hard knocks. Mentally and physically, the Lions seek men who will not take a backward step."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
