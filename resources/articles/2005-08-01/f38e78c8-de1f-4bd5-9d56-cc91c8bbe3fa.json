Despite the best attempts of \"sources close to the company\" to quash rumours of a bid from Norway's Norsk Hydro, its shares still finished top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after a day of extremely heavy trading. More than \u00a3240m of Centrica stock changed hands. Speculation over a deal with Norsk Hydro is not new. The two companies held merger talks earlier this year but they stalled after pressure from the Norwegian government, which owns 44% of Norsk Hydro. By all accounts Norwegian politicians were reluctant to back a deal ahead of parliamentary elections, to be held on September 12. However, traders reckon the logic of the deal, which would create a \u00a320bn energy company, has not gone away. Norsk Hydro is one of Europe's largest gas producers and Centrica has 11.7m residential gas customers. Moreover, City dealers are inclined to treat comments from \"company sources\" dismissing takeover rumours with a degree of scepticism. And with good reason. Both plasterboard company BPB, yesterday unchanged at 728.5p, and mobile phone group O2 knew nothing of the recent bids plotted by France's Saint-Gobain and Deutsche Telekom respectively. With traders taking the view that Norsk Hydro could strike after the elections, Centrica closed 9.25p higher at 252.75p - the shares' best finish since December. All told, it was a good day for utilities as investors decided the time had come to switch out of high-flying mining and metals stocks. Scottish Power proved a particular favourite of the market. Its shares advanced 10p to 498.25p, helped by news that Warren Buffett's Mid-American Energy Holdings expects to complete the $9.4bn (\u00a35.2bn) acquisition of Scottish Power's American arm, PacifiCorp, in the first quarter of next year. Once the sale is completed, City analysts expect Scottish Power to be gobbled up by a European rival, most probably Germany's EON. Elsewhere in the utility sector, International Power rose 3.75p to 230p while United Utilities gained 7.5p to 638p. Those strong performances, however, were not enough to stop leading shares from closing lower. Unsettled by the persistently high oil price and profit-taking in the mining sector, the scores at the close of play showed the FTSE 100 index some 25 points lower at 5,275.2. The FTSE 250 meanwhile eased 2.9 points to 7,704.5, while the FTSE Small Cap index added 1.9 points to 3,082. In the bond market, the 10-year gilt closed around 104.180, yielding 4.234%. Back among the blue chips, hot money was pouring into BAE Systems, Europe's biggest defence contractor. Its shares gained 1.75p to 326.25p on rumours that BAE Systems will announce at next month's interim results the sale of its 20% stake in Airbus to EADS, the Franco-German aerospace company. This holding is currently worth around \u00a32.7bn, but EADS would have to pay a premium above this. A sale would bolster BAE Systems' balance sheet and give the company a war-chest to pursue further acquisitions in the United States. It would also pave the way for a merger between BAE Systems and Boeing. Lower down the market, Mowlem, the troubled construction and support services group, rallied 5p to 135p. The gains came as house broker ABN Amro made contact with the company ahead of next month's half-year figures. \"While clearly we couldn't talk about numbers, we did gain the feeling that at these results the group would be able to provide some finality to the contracts examination process that the new management has been conducting for some while,\" the Dutch broker said. Mowlem shares fell sharply in July after the company warned that profits would be about \u00a320m below expectations because of a new policy on profit recognition. Mowlem also refused to rule out the possibility of further write-offs as it completed a review of all its private finance initiative and construction contracts. Elsewhere, Innovation Group, which makes software for insurers, improved 1.25p to 27.75p on speculation of a major licensing deal. Earlier this month, Innovation warned that it needed to close two or three big deals during the next three months to meet City forecasts. Rumours of a big transaction where also swirling around Aim-listed FirstAfrica Oil. Its shares firmed 0.5p to 11p on rumours a Chinese oil company, possibly PetroChina, is to reverse its African oil assets into FirstAfrica. Speymill Group, the property management company that boasts Howard Flight, the former Tory MP, as a director, improved 4p, or 14.5%, to 31.5p. City speculators believe that the company, which is backed by fund manager Jim Mellon, is looking for a new broker and is about to launch a property fund in Germany with one of the country's leading architects. Alizyme, the biotech company that is working on a pill to reduce the weight of obese people, moved up 9.75p to 113p. Traders noted Alizyme's chief executive Dr Richard Palmer has good links to GlaxoSmithKline, which does not have a significant obesity treatment in its pipeline. Corvus Capital, the investment vehicle of financier Andrew Regan, held steady at 14p despite the sale of its holding in Lodore Resources, up 0.25p to 13.75p, for \u00a34.5m. Finally, keep an eye on Parity, the IT services company. Its shares closed unchanged at 7.3p yesterday but could rally today. Just before the close of business last night, traders said an overhang of 14m shares was cleared. Shield close to deal Shield Capital was on the move yesterday thanks to rumours the Aim-listed cash shell, which is backed by a number of serious City players including the top-rated fund management team at stockbroker Walker Crips, is close to announcing a reverse takeover. Originally set up to pursue deals in the financial services sector, Shield has changed tack and is believed to have reached an agreement to buy a Swedish clean fuel company for about \u00a314m. Due to the high oil price, alternative fuel companies are becoming increasingly popular with investors. London's two listed biodiesel producers, Biofuels and D1 Oils, have both enjoyed strong share price gains in the past three months. Shield, floated in March at 5p, closed 0.37p higher at 8.12p yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
