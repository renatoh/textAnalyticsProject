In the perverse way of the modern news cycle, it was just an intriguing blip, and then it was gone. The speech to which I refer is Abbott's address to the Institute of Public Affairs in April \u2013 the Garden of Eden speech. If you haven't read it, I recommend you do. Abbott summarised his intention in this outing as a celebration of \"the freedom that our civilisation has nurtured, and the faith that has nurtured our civilisation\". The occasion was the 70th anniversary of the IPA. People will interpret this speech in different ways. Some readers will doubtless be struck by an Australian political speech which makes such explicit religious references (from the Garden of Eden to Exodus to Matthew's exhortation: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"), and makes such an unequivocal assertion of the connection between the Christian tradition, political liberalism and contemporary culture. Abbott doesn't present that visage much these days. In pre-election mode, his demeanour reflects the maxim that leaders win elections in Australia from the secular centre. Like Kevin07 before him, he has become a product for political victory, buffed and polished, all sound bites and optics and colour testing: no texture or rough edges, nothing off-script to impede maximum acceleration between now and September 14. But the most intriguing element of the IPA speech was not the reminder that Abbott is a man of faith. Abbott's Catholicism might be minimised to suit his current strategic imperatives, but it is present and fixed. Perhaps it takes one to know one. Unlike Abbott, I'm a lapsed member of the flock, but if you are hewn and conditioned by the faith, that's who you are, whether you resist it or whether you accept it. Cultural Catholicism has no opt-out clause. It's your sinew and your compass, your way of being and of seeing. The interest for me was the line Abbott walked between sympatico and difference. Parts of this speech I read as an effort to balance his Catholic hard-wiring (and by that I mean the conditioned response of Catholics to be community people, to see themselves as part of an organic whole, a rising tide with obligations to lift all boats) with the small-government, individualistic libertarianism of the IPA, his audience. Abbott constructed a rhetorical mid-point in this speech between letting the market rip and the sort of economic liberalism he approves of: \"capitalism with a conscience\". But rather than owning it as his view, he attributed it to the IPA. The IPA was not ideological or dogmatic, but a discerning friend of freedom. These were capitalists with consciences. It was a projection and a deliberate one, a collective understanding was imposed between the speaker and his audience. The speech in some respects was a bridge between his articles of faith, and theirs. The bridge-building recognises the reality that the IPA has become an organisational hub for the renaissance of the right in this country. Presented with a Keynesian, interventionist, assertively progressive \"never mind the plutocrats\" Labor government in Canberra, the right in Australia has found a genuine rallying point. The IPA and its fellow travellers are powerful, either through their personal wealth or their cultural influence. Guests on the night included the reclusive mining magnate and media player Gina Rinehart and media baron Rupert Murdoch, and Abbott was introduced on the occasion by influential Melbourne columnist and broadcaster Andrew Bolt. Abbott couldn't ignore this group even if he wanted to (which of course he doesn't). Realpolitik, if nothing else, demands a certain degree of lock-step. Abbott has some points of easy agreement with this group, and has acquiesced already on a substantial proportion of the IPA's policy wish-list. But he has not bought in all the way. That's because it goes to the heart of who Abbott is. He's conservative Catholic right, not libertarian Christian right. He's not a slavish disciple of markets, or small government (although fiscal circumstances and periodic stiffening from economic dries within the Liberal party may make him something of a latterday convert on this score at least). He certainly talks the talk on freedom, amplifying the anti-regulation mantras of Murdoch and the IPA on these questions (never mind the inconsistencies in their arguments, which would take another column to tease out fully; in this instance we'll only note there are inconsistencies, and move on). But Abbott's freedom is not an unfettered thing, an article of faith so powerful that the cards are permitted to fall where they may. Freedom, in Abbott's view, is intrinsic to the best of humanity and human history, but it's iterative, cautious and hedged by morality. Freedom isn't just an individual right; to have value, \"the framework of law\" must ensure a measure of equality. Governments intervene to protect a community of interest. Take these passages from his speech. \"In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve could do almost as they pleased but freedom turned out to have its limits and its abuses, as this foundational story makes only too clear. Yet without freedom we can hardly be human; hardly be worthy of creation in the image of God. From the Garden of Eden, to the Exodus, Athenian democracy, the Roman Senate, Magna Carta, the glorious revolution and American independence, the story of our civilisation has been the story of freedom and our struggles to achieve it. \"Freedom, ladies and gentlemen, is what we yearn for but it can only exist within a framework of law so that every person's freedom is consistent with the same freedom for everyone else. This is what the poet Tennyson meant when he described England as \"a land of just and old renown, a land of settled government where freedom broadens slowly down from precedent to precedent\". It's notable that Bolt has already given Abbott a smack around the ear for being too Labor lite \u2013 and by that, he means too interventionist. Bolt's column is an interesting piece in that it provides sharp and specific edges to the tensions between Abbott and this constituency. In a subsequent column Bolt defined his role thus \u2013 not as adviser to Abbott, but as enabler to an agenda: \"My role is to help expand the cultural space so what was once thought too hard, too risky, becomes the easy and sane. It is also to point to what needs doing, before most people are ready for the bother.\" Bolt is a maven, opening new territory for political leaders. In an era when voice-of-God journalism has been not only routed but is in full-scale retreat, Bolt's sense of his place in the firmament is unshaken. What I think of all that doesn't matter a jot \u2013 it's Tony Abbott that's going to have to live within it, manage Andrew's disappointments and the rest. I wonder what he makes of it in the privacy of his own reflections. Voters and readers will watch with interest how Abbott manages his relationship with influential fellow travellers, both similar and distinctively different. Abbott, like all political leaders balancing inputs and interests, has a choice: to be his own man, or to allow himself to be characterised as riding placidly in the slipstream of an agenda defined and \"expanded\" by others."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
