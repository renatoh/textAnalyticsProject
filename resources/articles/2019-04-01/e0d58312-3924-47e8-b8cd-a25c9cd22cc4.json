Taking in different environments over the series, the first episode is about life in the mountains. \u201cI\u2019m two miles above sea level and it is brutal,\u201d says our narrator Bear Grylls, perched on a peak at the start. \u201cCold. Desolate. Hard to breathe.\u201d I know the feeling. From the opening sequence of a snow leopard launching itself at a blue sheep \u2013 and hurling them both off the mountainside to tumble 200ft down, embraced in a terrible grapple \u2013 to the golden eagles trying to pierce each other\u2019s bodies with their talons, these are heartstopping scenes. Next are some barnacle geese. You know the ones \u2013 here in their thousands over winter, a bit unremarkable, boring almost. Can\u2019t we get back to the snow leopard? Only what follows is the most unflinching sequence I have ever seen in a nature documentary. A chick pokes its head out from under its nesting mother, then another two pop out. The geese have built their nest on top of a 400ft pinnacle of rock in Greenland \u2013 silly, perhaps, but there are predators around. Between a rock and a hungry fox. The problem is that the chicks need to feed within 36 hours, but the grass they eat is a mile away, their parents can\u2019t feed them in their nest and they are still a month off learning to fly. The only thing they can do is jump. The first one goes over the edge, its tiny, fragile body ricocheting from rock to rock as it falls, before finally crashing to the ground. It lies still for a horribly long time. \u201cIncredibly, it survives,\u201d says Grylls. It feels miraculous. \u201cBut it\u2019s stunned and now dangerously exposed,\u201d he adds. The chick is snatched by a raven. The second fluffy basejumper is mercilessly broken against the rocks. By the time the third tips over the edge, I can barely watch. It falls in slow-motion, little legs dangling like socks on a washing line, useless stumpy wings flapping, until it smashes on the ground and skids heartbreakingly down the snowy mountain. At last, finding its feet, it hops alongside its parents to the river. Next time you see a barnacle goose at an RSPB reserve, consider what it might have gone through. The main adversary here, however, is climate change. Within minutes, this is clearly set out: \u201cNow, with the rise in global temperatures, life is even tougher,\u201d says Grylls. So the snow leopard in the Himalayas, its thick fur meaning it can overheat and not run far after its food, is going hungry. Those goslings in Greenland are born in an early spring, their parents forced to migrate. Mountain goats in Montana are crossing unusually high rivers, thanks to record levels of meltwater. An avalanche takes out life in its thundering path. \u201cAs weather patterns change, avalanches across the world are growing bigger,\u201d says Grylls, his voice deepening with doom. And the gelada monkeys in Ethiopia are having to climb higher for their grassy food. There are 1,200 of them, and the males jostle for status. Looking for food as the climate warms, theirs is a life, says Grylls, of \u201cmoving, feeding and fighting\u201d. This might be us in a few years. We end where we began, back in the Himalayas, with the extraordinary footage of the snow leopard. He stalks the blue sheep with a desperate, nihilistic look in his eye \u2013 he hasn\u2019t eaten for days. Then he pounces and they fly over the edge and tumble down the mountain for half a minute, the leopard never letting go of its prey. The ultimate survivor, the leopard is hunting again \u2013 if a bit painfully \u2013 three days later. \u201cIt takes true grit to survive in these desolate, unforgiving landscapes, but somehow animals still manage to triumph,\u201d says Grylls, in his positive-attitude way, before adding sentimentally: \u201cTo find shelter, food and, perhaps most importantly, each other.\u201d It\u2019s a trite \u2013 and inaccurate \u2013 ending, though I suppose they needed something to go with the footage of snow leopards mating. \u201cThey are living proof of mountain animals\u2019 amazing ability to succeed in a changing world. Their offspring will be the hope for the future,\u201d says Grylls, attempting to end on a cheerier note. Having repeatedly shown the effects of climate change throughout the past hour, it feels feeble. These days, it\u2019s not good enough for documentaries about the state of the natural world to be so timid or unthinkingly optimistic. We are all falling off a cliff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
