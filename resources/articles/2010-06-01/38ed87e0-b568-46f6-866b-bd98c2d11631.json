The World Cup? Sorry, mate, didn't know it was still on. Poor Andy Murray had it easy last week when England's sporting tragics were otherwise preoccupied but no longer. The dead weight of local expectation can no longer be side-stepped, the first signs of Murray-mania are now discernible. When it comes to incurable optimism in the face of recurring failure the British remain reliably world-class. Of course we should know better. Experience should have taught us to be more rational. Drinking more barley water and investing in a Jimmy wig are not going to help. But that's the way our national psyche works: the worse we do on the global sporting stage the more we crave something truly extraordinary. For a proud Scot like Murray it must feel perverse to be asked to atone for the performance of a bunch of Englishmen playing a different sport and managed by an Italian. This year, more than ever before, it is the saltire he has to bear. Murray's successful arrival in the last eight without dropping a set even dove-tailed nicely with the departure from the men's singles draw of the last German representative, Daniel Brands. A familiar nagging question, though, boarded the night flight from Bloemfontein to London. When it matters \u2013 when it really, really matters \u2013 are we kidding ourselves that the best of British can hack it with the elite? Is it primarily the media's fault for talking up people who, when it comes to it, are not fully equipped to put the Great in GB? Are we instinctively a nation of 'Waity Katies', endlessly sitting around awaiting the great leap forwards? Maybe it would be better to take the advice of an American friend who once recommended re-naming this country Regular Britain to avoid further misunderstanding. You suspect Murray, for one, would not be averse to such an idea. At times yesterday against his reputable American opponent Sam Querrey he looked wonderfully serene, picking off returns with skill and precision, cracking backhands off the top of the bounce like someone deftly slicing the top off his breakfast egg. Then, suddenly, he would disappear into his shell for no apparent reason, cursing to himself and looking agonised. He is hardly the first top sportsman to play in frustrating fits and starts but a defining period in his career now looms. The time has come to prove he has the mental steel to surmount the recurring flat periods which stand between him and something truly remarkable. This would be the ideal week to prove the doubters wrong. At which point, inevitably, the whole tantalising 'what if' game starts afresh. If you squint a little bit, the draw is opening up for the 23-year-old, particularly if Rafael Nadal's knees continue to creak. Roger Federer is not quite the irresistible force of yore and the weather is set fair, good news for young men with stamina as well as plenty of shots. True, self-doubt can still descend on Murray's mind as swiftly and silently as grey mist sweeping over a Scottish loch but, for the most part, he appears calmer and more assured. He can volley and Querrey was suitably impressed: \"He hits the passing shots as good as anyone so he's a tough guy to play.\" Forget the wobble at the end of the first set and those squandered set points, dismiss the ever-present spectre of Federer and you never know... Sorry, it's contagious. We were still predicting great things from English footballers a mere 48 hours ago. All we can do is keep it simple and take it, ahem, one match at a time. Good luck, Andy, and steer clear of the newspapers if you possibly can. Rest assured the nation is right behind you and dream on. The only thing the British hate more than abject sporting failure is poverty of the imagination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
