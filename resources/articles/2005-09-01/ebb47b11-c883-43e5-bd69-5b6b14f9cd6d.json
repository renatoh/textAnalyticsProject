The Guardian will move full-colour next week and become the first mainstream daily newspaper in the UK to adopt a Berliner format, which is smaller than a broadsheet but larger than a tabloid. The marketing campaign, which includes national TV advertising, outdoor posters, and online ads, was designed by DDB, with media buying and planning by PHD. Marc Sands, the marketing director at Guardian Newspapers, said the campaign focused on three key messages: the change in size and editorial integrity, photography and pictures, and the new daily sports section. Online activity includes \"takeovers\" on websites including Channel 4, which will feature an interactive 3D demo of the new Guardian. A London double decker bus dressed as a mobile photography gallery will stop at sites across the capital, while a number of outdoor art installations carrying the line \"Think in pictures\" will encourage people to view their surroundings as a photographer. Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of Guardian Newspapers, said: \"This has been the most significant investment for GNL - not simply in presses and print sites, but in our journalism, design and the way in which we have communicated with our readers. \"It is the greatest opportunity the Guardian has had to gain reappraisal, and with that aim we are launching the most integrated marketing and promotional campaign readers will have seen from the Guardian - including TV, press, outdoor, point of sale and sampling.\" Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, said: \"The new titlepiece is the final element of our redesign and completes the new modern look of the paper.\" More than 12,000 retailers will be offered a choice from a range of specially designed Berliner display units, together with a number of different posters, shelf stickers and till wobblers. Joe Clark, the director of print, distribution and circulation at GNL, said: \"Retailers play a vital role in our success and we aim to offer them unprecedented support. In addition to our above the line activity we have worked closely with our sales promotion agency, 141 Worldwide, to develop a strong retail strategy and provide retailers with an extensive range of bespoke point of sale material.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
