A video in which Julia Kl\u00f6ckner talks to the head of Nestl\u00e9 Germany about her government\u2019s \u201cinnovation and reduction strategy\u201d and his company\u2019s \u201cphilosophy\u201d was sent out via the ministry for food and agriculture\u2019s official Twitter channel earlier this week. In the video, Kl\u00f6ckner, a member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), thanks Marc-Aurel Boersch for his support for the government campaign, which she says translates into \u201cless sugar, less fat\u201d in products \u201cthat citizens enjoy\u201d. The video was immediately picked up by Rezo, a German YouTuber who is fast gaining a reputation as the CDU\u2019s nemesis on social media. \u201cFun fact\u201d, tweeted the 26-year-old music producer, whose one-hour \u201cdemolition\u201d of the conservative governing party\u2019s policies has been viewed more than 14m times since it was uploaded on 18 May, \u201cif I had posted the exact same tweet with such a video, I would have had to mark it as advertising\u201d. The clip also drew criticism from opposition politicians. The leader of the German Green party\u2019s parliamentary group, Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, accused the minister of having produced an \u201cad\u201d for the Swiss multinational food and drink company,which has in the past been accused of questionable business practices and complicity in environmental damage. In 2010 Greenpeace accused Nestl\u00e9 of driving the destruction of the Indonesia rain forest through its use of palm oil. The company says it is committed to using 100% responsibly sourced palm oil by 2020. Karl Lauterbach, a health policy specialist for the Social Democratic party, the CDU\u2019s junior coalition partner, said the video was \u201cembarrassing, bitter even\u201d. \u201cFirst Kl\u00f6ckner let lobbyists argue away the sugar tax and the food rating system, and then she participates in a Nestl\u00e9 PR event,\u201d the politician said. Kl\u00f6ckner dismissed her critics as \u201chate speakers\u201d and told them to check their own party\u2019s policies on sugar reduction. \u201cFirst you complain that nothing is happening. Then you flip out when we achieve something,\u201d she tweeted. But criticism also came from her own ranks. \u201cAs a directly elected MP,\u201d said the CDU delegate Roderich Kiesewetter, \u201cI say there\u2019s no way you can tie a ministry so closely to a company. Why not [make a video] with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s competitors? Why make one at all?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
