Andrew Caplen, who took charge of the UK's largest professional legal organisation this month, is urging the MoJ to recognise it is already spending far less than anticipated thanks to a sustained fall in crime rates. In a letter sent to criminal law practitioners across England and Wales on Monday, Caplen calls for the second round of 8.75% fee cuts due next spring to be reassessed and reductions in the number of duty legal aid contracts for solicitors to cover police stations and magistrates courts put on hold. At present, there are about 1,600 duty contracts but the number is due to fall to 525 under the new scheme overseen by a government quango, the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). Firms may form consortia to bid for each duty contract. Caplen, whose law firm is in Hampshire, believes the LAA has not provided sufficient information in time for the bidding process to go ahead on a fair basis. For firms already facing severe economies, he fears that poorly designed contracts, in particular those covering vast rural areas with little crime, could tip them over into bankruptcy. \"The risk is that large numbers of law firms will close,\" Caplen told the Guardian. \"Some firms just do crime. Those firms that do not obtain a contract will have to close. Hundreds of firms may have to close and it's very sad for those who have put a lot of effort into them. \"People care passionately about the law. If our members want to put in bids for these contracts then more time is going to be needed to make it work. The LAA is not yet in a position to open up the tender process.\" The next planned round of 8.75% fee cuts for criminal legal aid is due after the 2015 general election. Caplen urged the MoJ to \"take stock and wait\". \"The amount being spent [on criminal legal aid] is declining due to the falling crime rates and more people being cautioned,\" he said. \"If less money is being spent on criminal legal aid, what's the point of going ahead with a reform like this and taking a chance [on whether it will succeed]? We are asking the government to delay the 8.75% fee cut.\" Caplen's letter informs criminal solicitors that the latest accounts from the LAA show a 3% fall in the number of legal aid cases in 2013-14 compared with 2012-13 and that total spending on criminal legal aid was \u00a3908.6m as against an expected spend of \u00a3941m at the time of the 2013-14 business plan. Caplen, formerly chair of the Law Society's access to justice committee, is concerned about the impact of deep cuts to legal aid on the criminal justice system. \"Legal aid is really important,\" he said. \"Justice is the most fundamental need for citizens. It has to be more important than education or health. What use is the rule of law if you don't have access to justice.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
