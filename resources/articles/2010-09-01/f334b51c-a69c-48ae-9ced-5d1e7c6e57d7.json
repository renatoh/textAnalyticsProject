The manager, Giovanni Trapattoni, gave the players a couple of hours off after training on Saturday and Fahey was able to drop in on his cousin Monique's wedding. When the Birmingham City midfielder did what blokes often do before a big bash, it might have brought a smile to his lips. Wallet: check. Tie: check. Vital goal for country eight minutes into competitive debut as a substitute: check. \"I was only at the wedding for half an hour and I didn't want to be turning up when they had just started their dinner, so we rigged it so I just nipped in between courses,\" Fahey said. \"I got a great round of applause. The goal was a very emotional moment and it's just a great feeling for me and my family. When I went to the wedding, my dad's brothers were delighted.\" It is not difficult to imagine what Fahey's uncles said to him. The 27-year-old lost his father, Declan, to cancer a little over a year ago and he has said everything he achieved in his career would be dedicated to him. Fahey's father raised him and his older brother Marc from young ages after their mother had left the family home. \"I'm sure he's with me now,\" Fahey said. \"I had a chat with him before I came over [for the international break] and I talk to him regularly.\" Fahey is making the most of his second shot at the big time, after admitting he came close to quitting the game. The Dubliner was a trainee at Arsenal before he signed for Aston Villa as a 17-year-old for \u00a3250,000. But it was too much, too soon; he did not enjoy the seriousness of being a young professional and he suffered from homesickness. He returned to Ireland in 2003 and played for St Patrick's twice and Drogheda United, from where he was sacked for disciplinary reasons. In his second spell at Pat's he found himself at the crossroads. \"A couple of my close friends were telling me to look at something else, apart from football,\" he said. \"I thought, 'One more year and that's it,' although I didn't know what I would have done. I gave it one more bash in my last season at Pat's and, luckily enough, I got another shout.\" Fahey joined Birmingham in January last year and helped the club win promotion from the Championship. Last season he featured in 34 of the club's Premier League matches, 18 of them as a starter. One of his father's final memories was watching him on television in the season opener at Manchester United. \"When I was younger I didn't see the bigger picture and I didn't enjoy being away from home,\" Fahey said. \"But this time around I'm more determined to keep going. I'd also say that over the last year I've got a lot stronger, mentally.\" Fahey believes he has made his case for inclusion from the start against Andorra in Dublin tomorrow night, in Ireland's second Euro 2012 qualifier, although Trapattoni is expected to use him again as a substitute. His impact on the campaign, however, is indelible. \"You realise the impact that scoring such a goal can have. People that I haven't spoken to in a couple of years have been texting. I must have got about a hundred texts. It's been brilliant.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
