The owners were rich in neither spirit nor love, but they did have tonnes of free make-up in the stockroom, sent over by every cosmetics giant in Manhattan. A brave writer, sick of waiting for his cheque, went into the office with a hammer. My friend and I, before quitting, ransacked the make-up room. The office was up the street from Sephora, which had quickly become my crack den. You'll find me there to this day, snorting $100 pots of Cl\u00e9 de Peau. I'm a model New York City single girl, pushing to the back of my mind the question of how to pay the rent, pupils dilating, hands shaking, as I drop the latest lengthening mascara into my basket. And lip stain. And eye gloss. I'm putting up layer after layer of expensive wallpaper in a house that is probably condemned. If it wasn't, I wouldn't be here twice a week, searching for the lipstick that will not only change my life but possibly save it. I have always worn make-up to write: red lipstick for journalism, coloured mascara for novels, bronzer for screenplays. In my downtime, I used to get stoned and put on make-up with my friend Hilary, letting her draw all over my face with a lilac Hard Candy glitter pen. She died young and tragic. She never could stay within the lines. There are many rabbit holes to fall in and out of in life: religion, rock'n'roll, addiction, crime, insanity. For women, make-up is another. It has always been thus for me. When, as documented in my novel Thin Skin, I went totally mad, I took the make-up with me. Think of Edie Sedgwick sleeping in her layers of pancake foundation. Think of Betty Blue weeping black mascara into her spaghetti, of Isabella Rosellini in Blue Velvet. Standing in front of a mirror, I smeared lipstick across my cheek, the international sign of a woman going off the rails. When I got well, I listened loud and often to Fingers Of Love by Crowded House. I don't know what \"Colour is its own reward\" means, but the line has always moved me. It echoed in my head as I wrote my new, \"straight\" novel. The line made me think how much I loved make-up, of the meditation and solitude it brings. The possibilities it conjures up, not just through colour, but through names. Some girls used to write names for future children in the margins of textbooks. I used to think of lipstick names. So does Sadie, the heroine of my book, who has my dream job: naming make-up for a living. There is a lot of very good make-up out there that I, even with my addiction, cannot bring myself to buy. Shu Uemura and Make-Up Forever are brilliant brands, with stunning colours. But their wares are named by number, so they hold no allure for me. No names? At $25 a lipstick, that's not minimalist, it's just idle. Far more than pigment and moisturising power, it's what we pay the cash for. The fantasy. Red lipstick is red lipstick is red lipstick. They're all pretty much the same. But, by not giving them names, Make-Up Forever and Shu Uemura do not allow us to fantasise, to pretend that the right one, the one that can change us, will save us. The greatest lipstick name of all time, and therefore the greatest lipstick of all time (available since the 1950s, it remains Revlon's best-seller) is Cherries In The Snow. More flattering on me is the sheer brick-red Cherry, by Vincent Longo. But as flattering as it is, its name is not enough to keep me hooked. I mean, what kind of Cherry, Vincent? Give us a clue. Could you not have named it Marty Maraschino, the alias Marty in Grease gives herself as teen idol Vince Fontaine drops aspirin in her coke? Or Cherry Vanilla, the infamous 1970s super-groupie? Like a song lyric, the best make-up names stir deep-seated emotion, senses of time and place, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, nostalgia for things not necessarily experienced. Like \"Colour is its own reward\", I don't know what Nude Renaissance ( a metallic brown-red by Fresh) means, but I like the idea of it. Some great make-up names evoke synaesthesia, the neurological quirk that leads to a crossing of the senses, so that certain colours come automatically with tastes and smells - Cranberry Lemonade lipstick by Fresh, say, and Lemongrass, a concurrently sharp and delicate yellow-green eye shadow by Chantecaille. Benefit, a San Francisco-based cosmetics line founded in 1976 by twins Jean and Jane Ford, is a master of the inviting name, which the sisters still pick themselves. There's Glamazon bronzing lotion, Bum Deal and Jiggle Gel cellulite potions and the new range of eye jewels, my favourite being the subtly sparkling Throw Me A Vine. The names, like the packaging, are pseudo-cheesecake and postfeminist. Fresh, my favourite line, is more ethereal in its names, all of which are decided by founder Alina Roytberg. She has brought my make-up cabinet such gorgeous eye shadows as Mission Fig, Marine Escort and Kiss At Saint Cloud. Fran\u00e7ois Nars names most of his high-end range after films. You can wear them and watch them, have all-girl theme nights with DVD suggestions from Fran\u00e7ois. But I find it is often better to wear his make-up in blissful ignorance, like not knowing the real lyrics to your favourite song. I think I liked Butterfield 8 lip gloss better before I knew I was supposed to be invoking a lonely call girl. And I certainly liked the hot pink lippy Funny Face better before I knew I had to marry Fred Astaire at the end. I breathe a sigh of relief that a glaring Doris Day gap means I've never seen Pillow Talk, her 1959 comedy and my current favourite lip gloss in the world. Roytberg has a tried and tested process for coming up with her names. \"I think in expressions and monikers. I always pay attention to the titles of things, and sometimes jot them down. When I travel - planes, trains, automobiles - I think of names, and not necessarily before I need to work on them. Twice a year, when I work on the new seasonal collections, it's the colours that inspire me, and then all the names I've been collecting just fall into place.\" Like Nars, she often finds herself coming back to the golden age of cinema. \"This coming fall 2005 palette is called Winter Picnic, and the song A Few Of My Favourite Things from The Sound Of Music was just playing in my head. So the colours ended up with names like Raindrops On Roses, Loden Blanket, Dry Earth, Mist On Everest and Moonlit Path.\" Clearly the new Fresh season suggests a good girl. But for the most part in the world of cosmetics, the heroine is the bad girl, staining her lips in Wanton by Benefit, spraying herself with Dior's Poison. The world of make-up is more open-minded than that of fashion: while clothes are usually about conspicuous wealth, make-up is about shifting identity - not necessarily either upwardly or downwardly mobile, merely different. Perhaps my favourite cosmetic name of all time is the red nail polish I'm Not Really A Waitress by OPI. Great make-up names, you see, don't have to evoke happiness or even hope. They merely have to evoke. Make-up is highly personal - after all, men don't like make-up as much as women do. They'd rather see our faces bare (or, rather, the young Brigitte Bardot approximation of bare). The love and inspiration that go into the best names drive home the truth that, for women, make-up is essentially masturbatory. We lose ourselves in a fantasy world of colour and moniker. When you have a make-up bag as big as mine, it can be fun, even frightening, to try to imagine where the layering of identities might stop. Because to make Pillow Talk lip gloss by Nars work, I first have to put on Chalet Girl face bronzer by Fresh and keep my hazel eyes glinting in the green spectrum with Benefit's Eggplant mascara. Just a colour, maybe not their best name. But the shade's so awesome I give it the benefit of the doubt and utilise my imagination, conjuring the time, as a nine-year-old on Halloween, that I found, on a Brooklyn gravestone, a bag full of aubergines (aka eggplants) stuck with needles of coloured ribbons. A local member of the Haitian community told me it was voodoo. Sometimes to make make-up names work, you have to fill in the gaps yourself. Occasionally, the packaging alone of a brand makes it worth the money - for example, the Victorian kittens on Paul &amp; Joe lipstick and eye shadow cases. Sometimes I just like the name of the brand itself: Napoleon Perdis does a damned good mascara called boring old Chocolate Brown. But c'mon, Napoleon Perdis. The quotations inside Stila eye shadow cases tend to be more impressive than the make-up names. Inside Kitten is printed the Edith Sitwell line, \"I have often wished I had the time to cultivate modesty but I am too busy thinking about myself.\" This is the joy of today's make-up names in a nutshell - they make it clear that the modern woman can care about both make-up and literature. In making up the names for the make-up in my novel, I stole a phrase from a piece Vanity Fair wrote about me when I was 16, calling a lipstick Literary Lolita. I interpolated the title of a Public Enemy album (a bronzer called Yo! Bum Rush The Glow!). Reviewing an old photo shoot in Interview magazine with Rose McGowan, I couldn't help noticing that an artfully painted pink slap mark on her bum matched her lipstick (hence the lipstick Ass-Slapping Pink). I slipped in a tribute to Soft Cell: Say Hello (Wave Goodbye). I named things I'd never wear (such as Cabbage Patch Kid, a bright green eye shadow) and things I'd wear if they only existed (Mystic Jukebox, a signature fragrance that unlocks the keys to the universe). To my delight, when the book was published in the US, Nars serendipitously sent me a lip pencil named Miss Sadie. It made me very happy indeed. I mean, Philip Roth: good writer. But I've never seen a lip pencil called Nathan Zuckerman \u00b7 Cherries In The Snow, by Emma Forrest, is published by Bloomsbury on June 6.
