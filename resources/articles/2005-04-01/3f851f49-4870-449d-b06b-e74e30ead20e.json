Productivity matters because it is the ultimate driver of living standards. The more output each worker can achieve during a working week, the richer a society becomes. Britain has a problem. The average German works two months less a year than us, but produces nearly as much, according to a new report out today from the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. While output per worker in Britain has overtaken Germany recently, output per hour worked lags well behind. The CEP puts the gap between Britain and competitors such as France, Germany and the US at 10%-25%. The gap is mainly the result of our chronic shortfall in capital investment and research, and lower skills among workers. But there are signs that productivity has picked up, helped by economic stability, the overhaul of competition policies, and efforts to improve skills. \"There has been some improvement ... and this has been going on for some time,\" says CEP head John van Reenen. He says during the late 1990s Britain even managed to keep up with the US. But the gap with the US remains large. Both he and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which also brings out a report on productivity today, argue that the improvement began in the early 1990s rather than after 1997, and has been on a steady upward trend since, though it seems to have picked up speed in the past few years. But Mr van Reenen warns increases in regulation and tax could squeeze companies and make them less keen on investing in new ideas and products."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
