But he said he had never supported the aims of the paedophile group. Lord Justice Fulford said he had been \"briefly involved\" in the 1970s with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), to which PIE was affiliated. The appeal court judge said he had \"always been deeply opposed to paedophilia\" and felt \"extremely uncomfortable\" when the PIE founder, Tom O'Carroll, attended occasional meetings of the NCCL's gay rights committee. But he said he had \"no memory\" of being a founder member of the Conspiracy Against Public Morals, which the Mail on Sunday said was set up to defend PIE leaders facing criminal charges. The Mail on Sunday claimed he also planned demonstrations outside courts where defendants were on trial and wrote an article that stated PIE was a way for paedophiles to \"make friends and offer each other mutual support\". It also claimed he asked future Labour minister Patricia Hewitt, then head of the NCCL, for help with the campaign and attended meetings with O'Carroll, who was sentenced to 2\u00bd years in prison in 2006 for distributing child abuse images. In a statement, Fulford said his involvement in civil liberty campaigns in the late 1970s was concerned with \"the way in which minorities were treated in the judicial process\". He said: \"I have throughout my professional life been concerned that individuals, whoever they are, should be treated fairly before the courts,\" adding that he had \"no memory\" of founding the Conspiracy to Corrupt Public Morals or the details of its work. He said any contribution he made would have related to concerns about the nature of the charge of conspiracy to corrupt public morals, \"which could be used against a wide variety of people in potentially inappropriate ways\". He added: \"I have always been deeply opposed to paedophilia and I never supported the views or objectives of the Paedophile Information Exchange. \"I attended a few meetings of the NCCL's gay rights committee. I remember that for a short period Tom O'Carroll was sometimes present, which left me feeling extremely uncomfortable. In the main, I provided some legal advice in the context of general civil liberties objections to the wide-ranging charge of conspiracy to corrupt public morals.\" Fulford said he \"profoundly disagreed\" with those who sought an age of consent below 16. Recollecting his involvement with the NCCL, now known as Liberty, he said: \"It became apparent that for a period there was an attempt by PIE to infiltrate the NCCL gay rights committee, and I repeat that the attendance of any of its members at meetings caused me considerable disquiet. \"On reflection, the NCCL gay rights committee should never have allowed members of PIE to attend any of its meetings, and a clear and real separation should have been created between the two organisations. I am very sorry for what happened. I have never espoused or in any way supported the objectives of PIE \u2013 the abuse of children \u2013 which I consider wholly wrong.\" The Daily Mail has run a series of stories focusing on former prominent NCCL figures, including Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman, her husband and fellow Labour MP, Jack Dromey, and the former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt, after the group granted PIE affiliate status in 1975. Harman has said she \"regrets\" the existence of PIE and its involvement with the NCCL. Hewitt, former head of the organisation has apologised for having \"got it wrong\". Analysis A judicial lesson in saying sorry Harriet Harman, Jack Dromey and Patricia Hewitt could learn a thing or two from Sir Adrian Fulford. On being told that the Mail on Sunday was about to accuse him of having supported the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) in the late 1970s, the appeal judge issued a detailed rebuttal and apology in plenty of time for it to be reported by the newspaper. Fulford was a QC in 2002 when he was nominated by the foreign office for election to the international criminal court (ICC). His appointment shortly afterwards as a high court judge was seen as a move to improve the chances that the UK would win a seat at the new judicial body. But Fulford, who turned out to be one of the few members of the ICC with experience of running criminal trials, soon established himself as a robust and independent presiding judge. Any suggestion that he was lucky to have made it as far as the high court was dispelled last May when he was promoted to the court of appeal, ahead of more experienced colleagues. All members of the court of appeal are made privy counsellors, which explains why the Mail on Sunday imagined that Lord Justice Fulford was an \"adviser to the Queen\". He is; but so are hundreds of senior judges, politicians and others who never advise her. In his statement, Fulford said he had always been deeply opposed to paedophilia and had never supported the views or objectives of PIE. He had always been in favour of reducing the age of consent to its present level of 16. Fulford, who is gay, recalled attending a few meetings of the NCCL's gay rights committee. On reflection, he said, that committee \"should never have allowed members of PIE to attend any of its meetings; and a clear and real separation should have been created between the two organisations.\" Fulford continued: \"I am very sorry for what happened. I have never espoused or in any way supported the objectives of PIE \u2013 the abuse of children \u2013 which I consider wholly wrong.\" His concern at the time had been at the use by prosecutors of the judge-made, catch-all offence of conspiracy to corrupt public morals. The Director of Public Prosecutions brought that charge against Tom O'Carroll and two other PIE members in 1981 after they sent a booklet to MPs advocating acceptance of adult love for children. O'Carroll was jailed for two years. Although there was growing public concern at the existence of an organisation that prosecutors described as \"sick and a force for evil\", the Guardian reported that there was precious little evidence to show that PIE itself had done anything criminal. Writing in 1981, Alan Rusbridger said the DPP's decision to charge PIE members with conspiracy to corrupt public morals by publishing a contact magazine \"caused deep unease amongst people who, however much they disliked paedophiles' activities, disliked even more the resurrection of a notoriously vague law which had recently fallen into disuse\". We now know that Fulford shared those concerns about a \"charge which could be used against a wide variety of people in potentially inappropriate ways\".
