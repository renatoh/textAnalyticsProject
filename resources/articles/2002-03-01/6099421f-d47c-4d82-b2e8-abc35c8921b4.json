The midweek conquerors of Real Madrid enjoyed further celebrations on Saturday as Walter Pandiani broke past three defenders and swept Deportivo into the lead against relegation-threatened Rayo Vallecano after nine minutes at the Riazor Stadium. But Javier Irureta's side had their centre-back Cesar sent off only six minutes later and Deportivo's 10 men tired after their midweek exertions. Rayo took advantage to equalise through Elvir Bolic 10 minutes before half-time and secure a surprise 1-1 draw. In Seville, Barcelona also saw their title hopes set back before renewing acquaintance with Liverpool at the Nou Camp on Wednesday - a Champions League game the English team dare not lose. Liverpool, bottom of Group B, can take hope from Barca's display in falling 2-1 at Real Betis. Carles Rexach's team dominated possession after falling behind to a Dani goal inside three minutes but looked short of ideas up front. They equalised only through a blunder by the Betis defender Ito, who headed into his own net from a corner on 55 minutes. Barcelona then missed a couple of decent chances to go in front and were made to pay as Dani delivered the winner with his second strike 12 minutes from time. The victory took much improved Betis above their latest victims and Deportivo into third place in La Liga. In the capital, Steve McManaman, coming on as a substitute, chipped in with a goal as Real strengthened their claims to another title with a 3-0 defeat of Villarreal at the Santiago Bernabeu, scene of their midweek disappointment. Real, though below their best, will be happy with a win that takes them six points clear of their arch-rivals Barcelona going into next week's clash at the Nou Camp. And, already guaranteed a Champions League quarter-final place, they can take a relaxed view of their Group C game at home to Sparta Prague tomorrow. Raul was left unmarked to nod in the opener on 14 minutes. Fernando Hierro tucked away a penalty given for a foul on Zinedine Zidane to make the game safe on the hour. McManaman rounded the goalkeeper for the third five minutes later. In the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich enjoyed a last-gasp 2-1 derby win before preparing for their latest Champions League confrontation with Manchester United on Wednesday in the battle for Group A supremacy at Old Trafford. Bayern's midfielder Thorsten Fink hit the winner against Munich 1860 with a header from close range just before time at the Olympic stadium. Bayern's wing-back Michael Tarnat had hit a post from a penalty in the 32nd minute after the Brazilian striker Elber was brought down in the box. Another Brazilian, Paulo Sergio, eventually put the European champions ahead in the 72nd minute but the visitors levelled three minutes later through the Austrian defender Martin Stranzl after a defensive blunder from Ciriaco Sforza. Uefa has lifted its blanket ban on any European club matches being played in Israel. In a letter sent to Israel's FA on Saturday, Uefa said that it had reviewed its decision to suspend all European matches there because of fears of public disorder or terrorism. The decision not to allow Hapoel Tel Aviv to host their Uefa Cup quarter-final first leg against Milan in Israel still stands - that game will be played in Nicosia, Cyprus, on Thursday - but European football's governing body said it would now review each fixture on a match-by-match basis, according to Israel's state of security at the time. It means that if Hapoel overcome Milan and reach the last four they may be permitted to play their semi-final home leg in Israel. Hapoel lost 3-0 at Maccabi Haifa in their top-of-the-table clash on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
