Pickings were thinner than usual but there were still lots of novelties to be found, including a small Palm-compatible PDA you wear on your wrist, and a $99 Olympus W-10 digital voice recorder with built-in low-resolution camera. This is not a silly idea if you can use mug shots to help identify the people you have interviewed. Microsoft's Windows XP Tablet PC Edition took the overall Best of Show award, presented by the editors of PC Magazine. Toshiba's Portege 3500 Tablet PC was voted the best PC, and Corel's Grafigo program for the Tablet PC was voted best personal software, beating Franklin Covey's TabletPlanner for Tablet PC. But Fossil's Wrist PDA interrupted the Tablet PC's triumphal progress by taking the award for best mobile device. Acer, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba had already unveiled their portable, pen-operated Tablet PCs at the UK launch earlier this month. Tatung, from Taiwan, also showed a familiar-looking system: Tatung supplies the Tablet PC that RM (Research Machines) is selling to British schools. Xplore Technologies attracted attention by showing its military-specification iX104 Rugged Tablet PC outside the convention centre, mounted inside a police patrol car. It has illuminated function keys that can be programmed, so officers can summon maps or licence plate details at the push of a button (www.xploretech.com/ix104/iX104.html). Walkabout Computers also showed a ruggedised mil-spec Tablet PC for mobile workers, the Hammerhead XRT (www.walkabout-comp.com/). Viewsonic, best known as a monitor manufacturer, showed both a Tablet PC and two Mira remote screens. Its V1100 is a simple 1.55kg tablet with 256MB of memory, an 866MHz Intel Pentium III processor and a 10.4-inch screen. It is available now for \u00a31,699 in the UK (www.viewsoniceurope.com/UK/Products/TabletPDA/V1100.htm). The company also showed V110 and V150 Airpanel remote displays with 10-inch and 15-inch screens based on Microsoft's Mira design, with 206MHz Intel StrongArm chips running Windows CE. The V150 also got a Best of Show award. You can use an Airpanel as a standard monitor, the bonus being that you can pick it up and walk around with it. Both Airpanels use Wi-Fi wireless networking to display screens from Windows XP Professional running on a standard desktop PC. They should be out early next year for $999 and $1,299 respectively - prices that suggest most users would be better off buying a notebook PC instead. Dell Computer scored a hit with its first PocketPC, the Axim X5, with devices priced at $299 and $199. The competition included Hewlett-Packard's iPaq Pocket PC h5400 series with built-in fingerprint recognition for security, and View sonic's Pocket PC V35. CMC Magnetics Corporation from Taiwan showed two handhelds: the PPC-500 and PPC-510 running Microsoft's Windows CE (which is used in PocketPCs), and the EZ range of four machines running a \"Palm like\" operating system called Penbex. The PPC handhelds have 206MHz Intel StrongArm processors with 64MB of memory, while the EZ models have 33MHz Motorola Dragonball chips and 8MB of memory ( http://cmc.taiwanet.com ). In the mouse market, Gyration drew the biggest crowds with its ultra cordless optical mouse, which has a built-in gyroscope. If you get tired of pushing it around a desktop, you can wave it in mid-air, like a remote control. It works with PCs and Macs at distances of up to 25 feet (www.gyration.com). The Gyration is available from several UK suppliers, including Dabs. Evoluent had a simpler idea: the VerticalMouse. This is a tall, right-handed mouse with the buttons on the side. The company says the shape \"supports your hand in a neutral, relaxed handshake position that eliminates forearm twisting\" (www.evoluent.biz). Another ergonomic option is the Ullman PenClic Mouse, from Sweden, which looks like a pen stuck into a small holder. However well it works, it has two drawbacks: the company expects it to cost more than $100, and the online brochure is in Swedish (www.kondator.se/pdfarkiv/pdf/penclic.pdf). One unexpected feature of the show was the arrival of more business card scanners. This idea was pioneered by the Covox CardScan (www.cardscan.com), which used text recognition software to scan a business card and try to enter the data into the correct fields. Pushing a button sent it off to Microsoft Outlook, ACT or another address book. Now CardScan has competition. NewSoft showed the Presto BizCard reader (www.newsoftinc.com), and Taiwan's Penpower Technology showed the WorldCard English business card recognition system (www.penpower.net/enversion). Sadly for Penpower, my Guardian business card was too wide to fit its reader. But the gadget of the show was probably Philips' iPronto TSi6400 wireless home control panel, measuring 9.4 by 7 inches ( www.pronto.philips.com). This has both Wi-Fi (802.11b) and infrared capabilities so you can train it to control almost anything. It has its own Intel XScale processor, 128MB of memory, web browser and 640 by 480 pixel colour screen, so it can download and display TV programme information.You can also use it to surf the web to look up the football results, for example, or order a pizza. It even has a built-in microphone, headphone socket and stereo speakers. I asked the price and was told it cost \"sixteen ninety-nine\". This sounded either impossibly cheap ($16.99) or ridiculously expensive ($1,699). There are no prizes for guessing which of those is correct."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
