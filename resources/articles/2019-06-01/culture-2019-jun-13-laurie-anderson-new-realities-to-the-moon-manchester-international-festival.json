Since a cannon-propelled rocket pierced the moon\u2019s surface in Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019 1902 classic Le Voyage dans la Lune, Earth\u2019s only natural satellite has been a subject of fascination for film-makers and visual artists. It might be 50 years since Neil Armstrong\u2019s giant leap for mankind, yet the moon still captivates and inspires. The moon is the focus of the latest work from avant-garde pioneer Laurie Anderson, which is fitting, given that she\u2019s a former Nasa artist in residence. To the Moon, her new collaboration with Taiwanese artist Hsin-Chien Huang, has allowed Anderson to create a typically definition-defying journey. She says of the exhibition, which reaches Manchester international festival on 12 July: \u201cI\u2019m happiest when I can\u2019t really define the work. To the Moon is an experiment in hybrids, seeing how these various media can come together and share images, stories and music.\u201d Anderson has never shied away from the cutting-edge, or the unknown. When making her first foray into virtual reality (VR) with 2017\u2019s Chalkroom, she encountered new storytelling challenges in a medium that gave the audience a level of control over their own experience: \u201cYou have to forget everything you know about narrative. At first I was terrified about giving up that autonomy. I had to give up the idea of definitive structure.\u201d It\u2019s a format that Anderson has fully embraced, returning to VR for To the Moon. She sees it as escapism from the screens so central to everyday life: \u201cI spend [so much of] my day on my phone, looking at these rectangles, that I just want to get up and out. So, it\u2019s a relief to me to work in a medium that can be more physical.\u201d It\u2019s escapism for the audience, too. Throughout the 15-minute VR artwork and accompanying film, the audience traverse numerous lunar landscapes, encountering rubbish sent from Earth, or enjoying a donkey ride in space. In our chaotic, conflicted times, Anderson is keen to present a diversion, while not ignoring the world around us: \u201cThere are so many sad things in the world. If you pretend they\u2019re not there, you\u2019re an idiot. They\u2019re there, they\u2019ll find you. So acknowledge they\u2019re there, but don\u2019t become it.\u201d She sees the state of the world as an opportunity to explore alternative landscapes: \u201cIt\u2019s a very good time to be creating new realities. The moon is a great subject for that \u2013 it\u2019s a great way to investigate the unreal.\u201d As cutting-edge and future-facing as the exhibition may be, it\u2019s underpinned by the almost timeless notion of adventure, the dreams of space that have inspired humans for centuries. Anderson concludes: \u201cThe moon has a very inspiring, dreamlike existence. Secretly all I want to do is to let people fly.\u201d \u2022 To the Moon is at The Studio, Royal Exchange Theatre, St Ann\u2019s Square, Manchester M2 7DH, 12-20 July \u2022 The Guardian is a media partner of Manchester international festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
