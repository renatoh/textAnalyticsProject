His had to have an additional flourish. So, having rolled away the rock, he hit George Foreman on the head with it. Foreman, roughly disabused of his conviction that all his rivals were entombed in physical inferiority, is by no means the only one left stunned by the blow and that gives Ali a particular satisfaction. He said so more than once in that muted time early on Wednesday afternoon when the turmoil detonated by his achievement had subsided for a few hours. Lying back on the thick cushions of an armchair in his villa, with the windows curtained against an angry sun that was threatening to evaporate the Zaire River as it slid like a grassy ocean past his front door, he talked with the quiet contentment of a man whose thoughts were acting on him as comfortingly as the hands of a good masseur. \u201cI kicked a lot of asses \u2013 not only George\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those writers who said I was washed up, all those people who thought I had nothin\u2019 left to offer but my mouth, all them that been against me from the start and waitin\u2019 for me to get the biggest beatin\u2019 of all times. They thought big bad George Foreman, the baddest man alive, could do it for them but they know better now.\u201d As he started the next sentence, Ali remembered the presence of his aunt, Coretta Clay, and the other cook, Lanna Shabazz, who had just been asked to \u201cfix two steaks and scramble about eight eggs\u201d for him. He checked himself, then shaped rather than spoke the words: \u201cAh done fucked up a lot of minds.\u201d That he has, just as he has opened up new horizons for the misled among the faithful, for those of us who have long considered him the most remarkable performer sport has ever produced and yet \u2013 with logic, the boxing forecasters\u2019 Iago, spitting falsehoods in our ears \u2013 found ourselves fearfully predicting that Foreman would be too young and too strong to fall before him. When something as close to a miracle happens, awe befits the onlookers more than analysis but Ali for his part was happy to dissect and explain what he had done. With myself, one other journalist and his household staff as the only listeners, he rambled for more than two hours through a generally subdued monologue that left out little of what he felt about the fight and its implications. He had been satisfied with the briefest of rests after his pre-dawn exertions and, in the words of his chronicler, Budd Schulberg, had \u201ctalked up a storm\u201d most of the morning. He would do so again later in the afternoon as he ranted happily from one press conference to the next (\u201cNow I can really boast\u201d) around his training camp at N\u2019Sele, forty miles from Kinshasa. But, given his mood in his living quarters at lunchtime, two interlopers were not enough to evoke the usual theatrical reaction, to justify the self-perpetuating stage act. So the scene, despite its occasional hilarity, was an oasis of seriousness, the still eye of his verbal storm. He was dressed in a short-sleeved black shirt and matching slacks and had kicked off the heavy running boots that are his regular footwear in camp to show white boxing socks with black rings round the top. His wrists and hands were uncluttered by decoration, or even by a watch. Apart from a small bruise beneath the right eye and some flecks of blood surrounding the iris (which he attributed to Foreman\u2019s thumb), he was unmarked. But he admitted that a left-side rib, which was first cracked nearly ten years ago and has been troublesome since, was again giving him pain. His voice was slightly hoarse, not so much from overuse as from the residual effects of a slight cold that had bothered him before the fight. A fairly severe cough racked him now and again and when it did he grabbed his sore rib and doubled over. \u201cMuhammad Ali stops George Foreman,\u201d he muttered with his eyes closed. \u201cMan, that is a hell of an upset. It will be weeks before I realise the impact of this. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m champion again yet. I can\u2019t wait to see all them magazines. They got to say I\u2019m the greatest now, the greatest of all times. I fooled them all. They thought I\u2019d have to try and dance against George, that my legs would go and I\u2019d get tagged. George thought that too. But that was my main thing, not dancin\u2019. \u201cThe trick was to make him think he was the baddest man in the world and everybody had to run from him. Truth is I could have killed myself dancin\u2019 against him. He\u2019s too big for me to keep moving round him. I was a bit winded after doin\u2019 it in the first round, so I said to myself: \u2018Let me go to the ropes while I\u2019m fresh, while I can handle him there without gettin\u2019 hurt. Let him burn himself out. Let him blast his ass off and pray he keeps throwin\u2019. Let it be a matter of who can hit who first, and that\u2019s me.\u2019 This was a real scientific fight, a real thinkin\u2019 fight. For me it was. Everythin\u2019 I did had a purpose. \u201cThere he was wingin\u2019 away and all the time I was talkin\u2019 to him sayin\u2019: \u2018Hit harder, George. That the best you got? They told me you had body punches but that don\u2019t hurt even a little bit. Harder, sucker, swing harder. You the champion and you gettin\u2019 nowhere. Now I\u2019m gonna jab you.\u2019 \u201cThen pop! I\u2019d stick him with a jab. \u2018I\u2019m gonna jab you again sucker,\u2019 I\u2019d say and there it\u2019d go. Pop! \u2018Nothin\u2019 you can do about it, sucker.\u2019 He didn\u2019t like gettin\u2019 hit with those punches. You see his head go on his shoulders, you see it turn every time I connected? And when did I miss? \u201cI\u2019d jab, then give him a right cross, then finish with a jab. Nobody expects you to finish a combination with a jab. Those punches took the heart away from George. Joe Frazier mighta taken them but they sickened George. When he did all that talkin\u2019 about concentratin\u2019 on his defence because he was scary about takin\u2019 punishment, people thought he was just a big man kiddin\u2019 along. But he really don\u2019t like punishment and I proved it. \u201cBy the fifth round, you remember when I leaned back on the ropes and gave him all the free shots he wanted and he couldn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 to bother me, by then I knew George had shot his load. I knew he was through.\u201d Ali\u2019s eyes lifted suddenly and he smiled at Aunt Coretta and Lanna Shabazz, who had winced and drawn in their breath as he talked of that fifth round. \u201cWere you scared when I let him punch away at me like that? It weren\u2019t nothin\u2019. He weren\u2019t hittin\u2019 no spots, no place vital where he could hurt me. I was leanin\u2019 back over the ropes with my head out of the way and my arms was savin\u2019 me from real damage on the body. If he\u2019d hurt me I\u2019d have moved. I knew what I was doin\u2019. You know I wouldn\u2019t go in there to let no street fighter mess me around.\u201d Coretta Clay, a small woman with the firm-boned features of the world champion\u2019s father, abandoned herself to a high, ecstatic laugh at the door of the kitchen. \u201cThere\u2019ll never be another like him,\u201d she shrilled when she recovered. \u201cHe is the Alpha and the Omega.\u201d As far as professional boxing is concerned, he pretty well is. When all the outlandish trappings of an extraordinary event have begun to fade and gather dust in the memory, when we have grown vague about the wheeling and dealing involved, about how ethnic pride and financial avarice became ardent bedmates, when we scarcely smile at the remembered sight of Bundini Brown planting a kiss and a \u201cFloat like a butterfly\u201d biro on President Mobutu or the more appealing but equally unlikely spectacle of an attractive young black woman breast-feeding her baby in the third row ringside, where accommodation cost $250 a place without mention of meals \u2013 when that distant day comes, what will remain utterly undiminished is the excitement of Muhammad Ali\u2019s performance. And for this witness at least the most vivid recollection will not be the inspiration of his tactics or the brilliance of his technique, spellbinding though they were. It will be the glittering, flawless diamond of his nerve. Many will see what happened in the Twentieth of May Stadium as an exposure of Foreman\u2019s deficiencies, of the self-defeating crudity and lack of imagination that had begun to drain him of both energy and resolution as early as the third round. But we are only aware of the extent of those weaknesses because Muhammad Ali refused to be impressed by the punching power of a man who had not been taken beyond the second round in his previous eight fights and who had annihilated the only two fighters ever to defeat Ali. Despite being in the best condition he has known since being forced out of boxing by the US government in 1967, Muhammad at the age of thirty-two may have had suspicions about the limits of his legs and wind but his decision to invite Foreman to crowd in on him must be seen as an astonishing act of calculated bravery. And his ability to function at maximum efficiency, without the slightest impairment of concentration, while the bombs were flying around his head in the early minutes, testifies to a fearlessness that even the prize-ring has rarely produced. And all this after turning back for his dressing gown and arriving in the stadium less than half an hour before he was due to fight. The man could pick flowers in a minefield and never miss a bloom. He explains it as simple confidence in his own abilities: \u201cAn experienced pilot flies a plane through a storm without gettin\u2019 in a panic. If new things happen he is cool. I have been boxin\u2019 twenty years and I\u2019m a pretty good fighter. I can walk into the firin\u2019 line with a man like Foreman and I got no fear. Nothin\u2019 can happen that I don\u2019t understand. I been to school. \u201cI was a pro nine years before he was. When he got knocked down it was new to him and he was lost. I\u2019ve been down. I\u2019ve been humiliated. Had my title taken away. Had my jaw broke. Had so much trouble with my hands for seven years now the doctors been tellin\u2019 me to quit. This time they were strong. I was able to hit the heavy bag and I fought without Novocaine injections for the first time in years. But I been through all these things. I know the hard side. \u201cIt was an amateur against a professional, a kid against a man. I tell you somethin\u2019, if he had got up I could have humiliated that boy. George has been actin\u2019 up with fancy clothes and all that stuff with his dog, and misusin\u2019 people, runnin\u2019 the press around, talkin\u2019 funny when he does talk. He used to be a nice fella but he\u2019s changin\u2019. You know how big it makes me to get the title back ten years after I won it from that other big bad bully Liston, to be just the second man to regain the heavyweight championship and the first to win it twice without ever losin\u2019 it in the ring. Yet you can walk in on me here and talk to me, no sweat. Tomorrow I\u2019ll be back in the ghetto pickin\u2019 up black babies and drinkin\u2019 soda at a corner store. I talk plenty but I don\u2019t act up like George.\u201d At that moment Foreman was hardly a picture of arrogance. With reddening bumps around both eyes and in the middle of his forehead, and signs that the old cut on his eyelid had wept, he looked and sounded whipped and weary and uncertain as he rested in his Kinshasa hotel. \u201cI admit he amazed me,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the distance he could lean back over the ropes was amazin\u2019. And he out-thought me tactically, planned his fight better than I did.\u201d Foreman did not seem to be inventing excuses when he said he had not felt right for four days before the fight. He says he found himself having to take excessive amounts of liquid and this suggests a chemical imbalance in his system that could explain the swiftness of his physical deterioration on the night, though Muhammad would suggest that any man who swings sandbags will tire if he hits nothing but air. In the villa, having eaten his steak and eggs and drunk a few pints of orange juice, the champion was watching a television cassette of a fight preview with rapt, boyish attention, his mouth slightly open. When he wasn\u2019t arguing with the comments of others, he was calling for proper respect to be shown to his own contributions. \u201cShhhhh \u2026 Listen to me here \u2026 Watch this \u2026 I was right, wasn\u2019t I? ... I said I\u2019d stop him after seven and he went eight \u2026 I even cancelled the rain. It stayed dry for the fight, then an hour after it there was a storm that nearly flooded the place.\u201d This was all bewilderingly true. He bent over the set with a hostile concentration when Foreman\u2019s manager, Dick Sadler, came up on the screen. Sadler said his man was a thunderous, murderous puncher. \u201cNo he ain\u2019t,\u201d said Ali flatly. Sadler talked of Foreman putting one opponent, Gregorio Peralta, in bed for four days. \u201cI got outta bed after two hours,\u201d said Ali. \u201cI put him in the bed.\u201d Next we saw Sadler holding the heavy bag while the former champion went close to punching a hole in it. \u201cTrouble was,\u201d said Ali, as if they could hear him, \u201cnobody was holdin\u2019 me.\u201d Who can hold him now? Those marvellously timed punches he threw in the eighth round on Wednesday put the promoters as well as Foreman at his feet. John Daly, the English entrepreneur, has already offered him $10 million for a third fight with Joe Frazier, in Beirut, and the expansion of closed-circuit television makes even more enormous sums feasible. Frazier is the likely opponent, though Ali acknowledges the contradiction that he will always have trouble with a man who was pulverised by Foreman. Ali will certainly not retire, partly because he loves the drama of boxing and partly because the money is too good to refuse. He says he has two or three million saved already (for a man who was about to watch Bonnie and Clyde on cassette he retains a touching faith in banks, has none at all in investments), but needs more to feel secure. In a sense, that is a pity, for Wednesday would have made a fine exit. As Coretta Clay says, he is boxing\u2019s Alpha and Omega. Now we have seen him, what can it offer us? Maybe both he and boxing should quit while they are ahead. This article appeared in the Observer on 3 November 1974. Ali did fight Frazier a third time, but in the Philippines rather than Beirut \u2013 and Hugh McIlvanney was there, for the Thrilla in Manila"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
