Shaw\u2019s difficult start at Old Trafford featured nine different injury setbacks and, perhaps most damagingly, the disclosure from Louis van Gaal not long after he had taken over as the manager that he did not think the teenager was looking after himself properly. A statement like that can have lasting repercussions, especially when the player in question is young and struggling to live up to a \u00a330m price tag. Shaw\u2019s fitness has been under scrutiny ever since but there is a theory \u2013 one that Hodgson subscribes to \u2013 that too much has been made of it and that more allowance should have been given to his age. Shaw has started the season like he wants to make up for lost time and was arguably England\u2019s outstanding performer in the 2-0 win over Switzerland that saw Wayne Rooney take Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s record as the country\u2019s highest scorer. \u201cI think he\u2019s been a bit harshly treated, personally,\u201d Hodgson said of the former Southampton player. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look as if he was looking after himself too badly at Southampton when he played well enough to get the \u00a330m move. I\u2019m not certain I want to jump on that bandwagon. It\u2019s just nice to see him back, playing confidently and showing the form that got him the move to Manchester United in the first place.\u201d Shaw\u2019s improvement since the start of August falls in line with Van Gaal\u2019s proclamation that the defender has taken on board the criticism and is ready to establish himself as the best left-back in the country. Van Gaal believes it will be \u201cthe year of Luke Shaw\u201d and Hodgson is convinced England have a player who can fill the position for the next decade. Shaw already has six caps and, born in the same week that Robbie Williams left Take That, there is a feeling among his sympathisers that too many people have overlooked his age, and that it was unfair to expect his move from Southampton, then aged 19, to be seamless. \u201cWe\u2019ve always believed in him,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cHe played in the last game in the World Cup against Costa Rica and I thought he played very well bearing in mind that was his first [tournament] game. After that, he was pencilled in as the player who could give Leighton Baines a run for his money but he had a tough season and I think one thing will undoubtedly be proven true. That tough season \u2013 and it must have been tough for him and his family \u2013 might benefit him in the long run. \u201cHe\u2019s still only 20 and if he keeps going then he\u2019s on track to be another Ashley Cole \u2013 a 100-cap man. I would advise him to study Ashley Cole, look at what Ashley did for England and set my sights on the same thing.\u201d With Nathaniel Clyne looking increasingly impressive at right-back, England\u2019s defence for Euro 2016 is taking shape even if Hodgson was dissatisfied with the team\u2019s overall structure against Switzerland. \u201cIf you put me on the spot and said: \u2018Are you 100% satisfied with the performance?\u2019 I would have to say no, and that I wanted to see us do better than that,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cI\u2019m happy saying that having won 2-0, rather than it being 0-2, but it\u2019s got to be better. We\u2019ve still got work to do. Luckily we\u2019re not playing the first game in the Euros tomorrow. We do have some time and we will keep working at it.\u201d Hodgson can be encouraged by the performances of his full-backs whereas Chris Smalling, a player he remembers signing for \u201ca bag of balls\u201d when he was Fulham manager, has improved dramatically in the last year. \u201cWe signed him for nothing, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Hodgson said, thinking back to Smalling\u2019s arrival at Craven Cottage from Maidstone United in 2008. It was actually \u00a310,000 but the point still stood. \u201cI\u2019m delighted for him because he\u2019s a player who has really had to fight to get to the position that he\u2019s achieved today,\u201d Hodgson said. Equally, the England manager must feel satisfied Joe Hart has overcome that period where he had become worryingly accident-prone a couple of seasons ago and that his position as England\u2019s best goalkeeper can no longer possibly be disputed. Hart has not conceded a goal this season in four games for Manchester City and another two for England. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased for him,\u201d Hodgson said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
