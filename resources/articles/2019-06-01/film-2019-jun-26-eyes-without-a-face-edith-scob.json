Her agent confirmed the news to AFP, saying she had died on Wednesday in Paris. No cause of death was disclosed. Scob\u2019s role in Eyes Without a Face is one of the great breakout performances in French cinema. Playing the daughter of a surgeon who undergoes extensive skin grafts after her face is disfigured, she spends much of the film swathed in bandages or wearing a mask, only her eyes visible. Scob\u2019s ethereal, expressive qualities made a stunning impact and the film has remained a cult favourite. Modern audiences are more likely to know her for her appearance in Leos Carax\u2019s 2012 film Holy Motors, where she played a limousine driver taking Denis Lavant\u2019s mysterious Oscar to his \u201cappointments\u201d. At the end of the film she dons a mask in homage to her iconic role. Born \u00c9dith Scobeltzine in Paris in 1937 into a family of Russian immigrants, Scob studied at the Sorbonne and embarked on a stage career in the late 1950s. She quickly made headway in cinema, and was cast in a small role in Georges Franju\u2019s Head Against the Wall in 1959, before securing her first leading role in Eyes Without a Face. Scob would go on to make three more features with the director, including the 1963 revenge thriller Judex. On screen, Scob worked steadily, with roles in films such as Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s 1969 film The Milky Way (in which she played the Virgin Mary), Jacques Rivette\u2019s 1994 Jeanne la Pucelle (as Jeanne de B\u00e9thune). A resurgence in the late 90s saw her cast in the popular French hit Venus Beauty and Ra\u00fal Ruiz\u2019s Proust adaptation Time Regained, both released in 1999. Since the turn of the century she has been nominated for C\u00e9sar awards for best supporting actress for Olivier Assayas\u2019 family chamber piece Summer Hours in 2008 and Holy Motors in 2012. Scob maintained a high-profile stage career alongside her film work, with a string of roles in French drama, including Racine, Moli\u00e8re and Anouilh. In 1976 in collaboration with her partner, the composer George Aperghis, she founded the avant garde theatre group Atem (Atelier Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et Musique), designed to involve the disadvantaged in the deprived suburbs of Paris."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
