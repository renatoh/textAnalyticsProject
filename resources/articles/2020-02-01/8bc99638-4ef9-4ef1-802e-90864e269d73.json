Fear is no reason to be racist. Statistically, as a British citizen who hasn\u2019t been to China in two years, I have the same risk level as a white person.\u201d Coronavirus has spread to at least 16 countries including Japan, Thailand, Australia, France, the US and the UK. Hostility and racism directed by some people towards east Asians seems to be spreading faster still. Jess Kerntiff, who works in PR, said she was stunned when a friend sent her a viral Instagram post of \u201cbat soup\u201d falsely purporting to be a Chinese dish while making bogus claims that Chinese culture is to blame for coronavirus. \u201cShe kept asking me if I\u2019d eaten it, what was the weirdest thing I\u2019d eaten and so on. When I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, crab or something\u2019, she kept asking me what weird things people eat in Malaysia, which is where my family are from.\u201d Kerntiff said she couldn\u2019t quite articulate at the time why it was upsetting. \u201cIt bothered me though, she\u2019s a really good friend and I explained to her after a couple of days and then she got it, but posts like that deliberately dehumanise Chinese people. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being paranoid but there doesn\u2019t seem to be much sympathy for people who have lost their lives and are going through this trauma, the narrative is as if it\u2019s deserved. There is no compassion.\u201d London\u2019s Chinatown was uncharacteristically quiet last week, with businesses reporting a slump in trade. \u201cThe restaurants are less busy than normal,\u201d confirmed one manager. \u201cYou think, maybe it is the weather and people think it\u2019s too cold and rainy to come out. But maybe it\u2019s because people believe fake news and are scared [of] eating Asian food.\u201d One British-Chinese woman, who didn\u2019t want to give her name, said she felt anxious travelling on public transport. \u201cPeople have openly moved away from me on the train. Fear for me is having half my family in quarantine in Wuhan \u2013 the hysterical fear that many in western countries have is quite insulting to me.\u201d She was in daily contact with relatives in the Hubei province, who reported feeling well. \u201cMy parents here are not as panicked as some of the people I\u2019ve encountered on Twitter and in real life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe virus is being weaponised as a way to be openly racist \u2013 the French media have already called it \u201cyellow peril\u201d \u2013 as if there isn\u2019t a bigger health threat from parents who won\u2019t vaccinate their kids.\u201d The number of Chinese students at UK universities dwarfs those from other countries; in the 2016-17 academic year, there were 95,090 Chinese undergraduates and postgraduates in Britain. By comparison, the second-biggest international cohort is made up of 17,580 students from the US. At the Central Saint Martins campus, part of the University of the Arts London (UAL), the mood was muted. \u201cOur focus is to keep calm and carry on and avidly watch official guidance,\u201d said Julie Dark, associate director of communications. \u201cPanic is high but the risk is low, and we\u2019re supporting students who are worried.\u201d The standup comedian Ken Cheng, who encounters racial abuse frequently online, said he was not surprised at how the virus was exposing deeper prejudices. \u201cThere\u2019s been a bit of tension\u201d travelling on public transport, he said, but he was more concerned by how normalised anti-Chinese sentiment is. \u201cAround Chinese people, there has always been a thing where people think they can say whatever they want in a way they don\u2019t about other races, so you see all this stuff at the moment about all Chinese culture and people being dirty and barbaric, as if that\u2019s fair game.\u201d Cheng was circumspect about why this might be but wanted to point out that he was as anxious about the virus as the next person. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because we have a more submissive culture, we\u2019re not very aggressive and don\u2019t get into fights. Maybe we\u2019re just stoic. At the moment, the risk [of catching the virus] seems very low. For a major outbreak, it doesn\u2019t seem too bad. It\u2019s not a disaster movie.\u201d *Some names have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
