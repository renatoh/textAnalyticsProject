This fact may have surprised many who heard it, however. Though Alsop's programme consisted of music connected with Vienna, it contained not a single work written in the designated period - that exciting, if rocky, epoch in Austrian history that saw the emergence of expressionistic atonality, the flowering of Freudian psychoanalysis, and the country's shift to the political far right. Instead, Alsop focused on the influence of Viennese music on film, and what we actually got was a concert of classical pops that have found their way on to various soundtracks. One might have expected the usually dynamic Alsop to bring this off to perfection, but on this occasion her energy seemed dimmed. The low point came with the Adagietto from Mahler's Fifth Symphony, given a Death in Venice treatment and a performance of wavering slowness, and made worse by the fact that the CLS's string section couldn't attain the requisite plush sound. Johann Strauss's Blue Danube was blowsy and unyielding, while Beethoven's Fifth Symphony revealed a flaw in Alsop's methodology, a tendency to start at such a pitch of intensity that she leaves herself little space for emotional development. With the overture to Mozart's Die Zauberfl\u00f6te she settled a bit, admirably judging its balance between profundity and humour, though she only struck form with Korngold's Violin Concerto. Reworking themes from some of Korngold's film scores, the concerto elides Hollywood glitz with perfumed, secessionist opulence. The soloist was Benjamin Schmid, technically staggering and headily voluptuous in tone. Alsop, meanwhile, gets the work's extravagant combination of American razzle and Mahlerian sonic profusion absolutely right - a knockout performance that made an otherwise lacklustre evening worthwhile."}, "isHosted": false}}}
