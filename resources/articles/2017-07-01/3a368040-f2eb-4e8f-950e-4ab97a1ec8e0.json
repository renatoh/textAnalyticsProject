Ed Woodward, the United executive vice-chairman, spoke with Levy at the start of the close season and registered their interest in Dier, who sees himself as a defensive midfielder, although he played in Tottenham\u2019s defence for most of last season. It is understood Woodward made a bid for the England player \u2013 on the instructions of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 but Levy knocked it back. Furthermore, Levy made it plain he was not interested in selling Dier and United ought to take this as his final word on the matter. United, who have announced that Michael Carrick will take over as the captain after Wayne Rooney\u2019s departure, have refused to do so, particularly after their efforts to look elsewhere for the defensive midfielder Mourinho has demanded encountered problems. They thought they were close to a deal for Nemanja Matic but their hijacking of Chelsea\u2019s move for Romelu Lukaku has soured relations and made the Matic transfer difficult to complete. Lukaku joined United from Everton on Monday for a fee that could rise to \u00a390m. Dier, who admitted in 2010 while at Sporting Lisbon that it would be difficult to turn down United if the chance came to join the club he supported as a boy, has been Mourinho\u2019s No1 midfield target this summer and Levy may face a dilemma when United\u2019s offer is broken down. They are considering making a second offer of \u00a350m for the 23-year-old and would more than double his \u00a370,000 weekly wage, taking it beyond Tottenham\u2019s \u00a3100,000 ceiling. If Levy were to block Dier\u2019s transfer, what would he do about his salary? It would be impossible to come close to matching United\u2019s offer without breaking Spurs\u2019 wage structure and Levy will not do this for fear of encouraging other players to ask for large rises. Dier, who is under contract until 2021, was displaced as Tottenham\u2019s first-choice defensive midfielder by Victor Wanyama, who was signed from Southampton in June last year. Dier played mostly in central defence as part of a back four or back three but wants to secure one position \u2013 defensive midfield. He knows Mourinho would play him in his favoured role. Tottenham are prepared to sell one player from their first-choice XI \u2013 Kyle Walker, the right-back who is a target for Manchester City, but negotiations have become protracted as Levy believes he is in a powerful position, which is always bad news for the potential buyer. Levy wants at least \u00a350m and feels it is fair in terms of the market. The 27-year-old was the best right-back in the Premier League last season, according to the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, who named him in their team of the year. Walker is entering his prime years; he is tried and tested in English football and his Englishness adds a further premium. City, meanwhile, look to have missed out on another right-back target, with Dani Alves likely to join Paris Saint-Germain. Mauricio Pochettino could replace Walker, who has four years to run on his contract, with Kieran Trippier and the Spurs manager could use the fee from the sale to strengthen his squad. Pochettino would be less willing to cash in on selling Dier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
