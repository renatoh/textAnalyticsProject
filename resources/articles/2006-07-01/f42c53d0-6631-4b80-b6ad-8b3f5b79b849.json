Aleksandar Panic, 17, was stabbed to death in the \"prearranged\" brawl in a Belgrade suburb on Thursday night between dozens of fans of the capital's two most popular clubs - Red Star and Partizan, police said. Twelve people were arrested after the fight that involved knives, sticks, stones and fists, police said. Several men were slightly injured. It was not clear why the hooligans set the brawl for Thursday night near a local soccer stadium during the offseason. But such fights have been staged before between supporters of the two rival teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
