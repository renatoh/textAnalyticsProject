This five-piece from Rome (featuring members of noted Euro punks Taxi) play stompy, super-melodic garage-glam with a pitch-perfect level of cheap gloss, doting retroism and quite glorious silliness. From Wild Tiger Woman's honky-tonking strut via Yellow Dash's Slade-ish lollop to Teenage Rebel's faintly psych-pop shimmer, the hooks are relentless, the playing unfussily skilful and the charm unfailing. That's before you even get to the song about that time Giuda won the World Cup (it was 1-0; it's not entirely clear who they were playing against), or the sleek, almost spacey homage to the wearing of wheels on one's feet that is album highlight Roller Skates Rule OK (to be enjoyed in conjunction with that quite glorious album cover). Bright, brilliant and clearly actually rather big of heart, Giuda are beyond a joke, in the best possible way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
