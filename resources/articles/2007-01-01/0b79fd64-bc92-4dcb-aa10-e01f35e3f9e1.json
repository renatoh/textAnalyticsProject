It's the one hope we have to stem climate change, curb pollution and counter pandemic diseases. Some of us may not believe this, but many in power do. Just look at Africa. Once, aid was the answer. Then trade. Now it's science. Not brawn but brains will lift the ravaged continent out of poverty. How much African leaders believe in their own rhetoric will be clear at the end of this month when they gather in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to dedicate an African Union summit for the first time to science and climate change. African researchers on and off the continent may rejoice at this. Long have they watched their universities crumble and their grants dwindle. Many have left. Many would like to return. But it should also be good news to the world of science at large. Africa houses many questions, and potentially many answers, to problems facing mankind today. Diseases like malaria may spring up in Europe again if temperatures rise. HIV/Aids is a global problem, as is producing clean and cheap energy. Last month, the UK development secretary, Hilary Benn, launched a new body, the UK Collaborative on Development Sciences (UK-CDS) to coordinate the country's medical, agricultural and environmental research to assist development. The body, housed by the Wellcome Trust, will aim to boost the contribution made by UK science to poor countries. So far, so rosy. Except that it's not, not for Africans at least. While African leaders may agree that they need science, they are finding it very hard to agree on a common strategy. In fact, there are question marks over what the heads of state will actually be able to resolve. In November, African science ministers met to agree ambitious flagship projects for the presidents to endorse. They failed, and so far only a bland suggestion to create a pan-African intellectual property organisation has passed muster. One reason for the dearth of flagship proposals is political. Many science ministers are reluctant to pass the buck to their superiors - either fearing for their jobs or afraid to overload those who sign their paychecks with new duties. Another is to do with the rival interests of nations. Proposals to relocate the continent's best researchers to a handful of centres face opposition from those who fear it will usurp their national science budgets, and from those who worry about brain drain. Last, and most worrying, science in many parts of Africa is still kept in the silos of ministries, where it is unlikely to reach the areas of government in which it is meant to do good. If this is not changed, the outcome of this month's summit may still be good for Africa's scientists - but it will have been a wasted opportunity for everybody else. \u00b7 Linda Nordling is editor of Research Africa. ln@research.research.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
