Not to mention Andra and Cassandra and Claire and Diana (Krall, at the Albert Hall tonight) and Dianne and Eliane and Jacqui and Juliet and Liane (Carroll - terrific at the Barbican gala concert for Ronnie's) and Molly and Niki and edgy, sexy Patricia and Rebekka and Silje and Stacey and Tina. And Michael Buble - not so much a jazz star as a bad, sad Frank Sinatra tribute act. YABJS as in Yet Another Bloody Jazz Singer. Which is how you might greet singer/pianist Peter Cincotti. Fortunately his album On the Moon (Concord, \u00a313.99) is fresh, accomplished and much more likable than anything by Buble, though I found myself skipping all the slow \"date songs\". Cincotti, still in his early 20s, sounds good on swinging numbers such as St Louis Blues and Raise The Roof; maudlin on You Don't Know Me and the self-penned title track. Producer Phil Ramone, despite lapses into oily and unnecessary vocal double-tracking, makes Cincotti sound like a star. Lydia Lunch works with jazz musicians and sings (sort of) but she's hardly a YABJS. On Smoke in the Shadows (Breakin Beats, \u00a313.99) she comes across like Laurie Anderson's evil twin, snarling her way through tall tales told in a yuppie nightmare/femme fatale persona. On three tracks written and co-produced with guitarist Nels Cline (who recently joined Wilco) Lunch comes across like Tom Waits's little sister jamming with the Charles Mingus Jazz Workshop. The other songs employ semi-programmed punk-funk made with Tommy Grenas and Len Del Rio, and (for one track) Terry Edwards. The kasbah-reggae groove of Sway, vaguely evoking the chords to Summertime, makes her sound more like the evil twin of Bebel Gilberto. Similarly dark, but with a powerful shaft of musicianly daylight, is Christine Tobin's Romance and Revolution (Babel, \u00a313.99). The backing - just guitar (Phil Robson), percussion, double bass and drums - is modest but effective on songs such as Horses (Tobin's setting of a poem by Paul Muldoon) and John Martyn's Go Down Easy. She explores the blues and roots of jazz with a greasy, guitar-driven version of Young Woman's Blues (by Bessie Smith) and there's an affecting, personal reading of God Only Knows. Jamie Cullum, a YABJS himself only two years ago, covers the same Brian Wilson song on his DVD Live at Blenheim Palace (Universal, \u00a315.99), with a string arrangement \"in the style of Eleanor Rigby\". Cullum's version doesn't work as well as Tobin's, but you have to admire the ballsy way he attacks his material and takes risks as a performer. It's a highly enjoyable DVD, with extra backstage footage and a video of I Want to Be a Pop Star - one of the great jazz novelty records of the 21st century. The other one is Jazz Planet (Dune CD single and 12-inch, \u00a35.99) by Soweto Kinch. This is a monster track, with serious playing and hilarious rap lyrics that conjure up the delicious inverted scenario of cash-strapped boy bands and moaning DJs who struggle to make ends meet while righteous jazz musicians get all the best gigs and put the world's wrongs to right. Just buy it - each sale goes a little bit towards making Kinch's wild and crazy dream come true. He's a Young And Brilliant Jazz Storyteller."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
