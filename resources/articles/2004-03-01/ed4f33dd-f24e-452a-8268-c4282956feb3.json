At 101 for 4, West Indies could have been dismissed for 200. At 281 for 5, they might have got closer to 375. Join me tomorrow at 2.30pm for more live coverage. Thanks for all the emails, and good night. 85th over: West Indies 311-9 (Collymore 3, Edwards 1) The umpires have offered the batsmen the light, and they've taken it in a flash. There are still 5.2 overs to go, and we're already more than 35 minutes past the scheduled close. Slapped wrists for Michael Vaughan. 84th over: West Indies 311-9 (Collymore 3, Edwards 1) Edwards is almost decapitated by his first delivery - a beamer from Harmison that he manages to knock away with his glove. Harmison apologises immediately, which suggests there was no malice involved, but Edwards is still shaking his glove as Harmison runs in to bowl the next delivery. Edwards pushes a single to third man, before Collymore takes two through square-leg. WICKET! Best lbw b Harmison 20 (307-9) A great yorker from Harmison traps Best on the crease, but I think that was heading down leg. No matter - just one more wicket needed now. 83rd over: West Indies 305-8 (Best 18, Collymore 1) The umpires have had their first look at the light meters, which, with seven overs still to play, says a lot about England's tardiness in the field. Hoggard makes the same mistake as Harmison of pushing the ball too wide of the stumps to trouble the tail. A maiden, which is fairly irrelevant in the circumstances. 82nd over: West Indies 305-8 (Best 18, Collymore 1) Harmison gets to use the new ball at the other end, but he wastes it, bowling too wide outside off stump to trouble Corey Collymore. A pinched single completes a disappointing over. \"Rest assured, Tom Walden-Jones, I had a lovely time at the pub, but I'm a loyal over-by-over reader and didn't want to miss it for the whole evening,\" reports Andrea Lowe. \"Either that or I've got to be at work early tomorrow. As for my Ashes success, whatever happened to a woman having a bit of mystique?\" Say no more. 81st over: West Indies 304-8 (Best 18, Collymore 0) Hoggard takes the second new ball, but Best swivel-flicks him superbly over square-leg for four. Quite a shot from a No8! \"Thanks for posting my mail (77th over),\" writes Ashley Mills. \"But having re-read the first-session notes, my team-mate Andy got in before me (2.27pm). I am now making plans to leave the country.\" 80th over: West Indies 300-8 (Best 14, Collymore 0) Ten overs to go. England's openers could face a tricky couple of overs if they bowl the Windies out before the close. WICKET! Sanford c Trescothick b Flintoff 1 (300-8) At last, Flintoff finds Sanford's outside edge after numerous prods-and-misses. The ball flies low to Marcus Trescothick, who makes no mistake at first slip. \"I've got one more,\" exclaims Lee Linthicum. \"Laurence Harvey, the actor. From The Manchurian Candidate. He was the hypno-killer who put a bullet in Angela Lansbury's brain.\" Walking encyclopedias, the lot of you. 79th over: West Indies 300-7 (Best 14, Sanford 1) Up comes the West Indies 300 as Sanford flinches a single to long leg off Jones. Play should have finished for the day by now, but England have bowled their overs so slowly that we're about 40 minutes behind schedule. \"Thanks for brightening up the evening with the cricket,\" writes Matt Grime. \"We were driven from the pub so they could watch Liverpool draw some dull game of football. Had I known you were doing this I wouldn't have even bothered with the pub... Well, ok, that might not be true.\" Talk about building a man up, only to knock him down, Matt. 78th over: West Indies 298-7 (Best 12, Sanford 0) Flintoff replaces Giles at the Headley Stand End, but Best pinches a single into the covers. Sanford is content to survive, which he manages. Just. With 12 overs to go, it's drinks here at Sabina Park. Always wanted to say that. \"I see that Ms Lowe is back,\" writes the ever-observant Tom Walden-Jones. \"Her late night appearance would suggest that the Ashes matchmaking (see over 38) was (sadly...) unsuccessful. Did she have a good time at the pub?\" The nation awaits the answer with baited breath... 77th over: West Indies 295-7 (Best 10, Sanford 0) Jones senses blood here, and who can blame him with a rabbit like Adam Sanford in his sights. That over was fast and straight, but to his credit Sanford gets everything behind the ball. A maiden. \"Just logged on but I will win \u00a3100 if I am the first player from Lockers FC to get a mention today,\" writes Ashley Mills. \"My penalty if I fail is to kiss Homer who is a huge and ugly team-mate, so I am practically begging for your help. Top work so far, I have no more meetings planned this week so will have greater loyalty.\" Looks like the dosh is yours, Ashley. 76th over: West Indies 295-7 (Best 9, Sanford 0) Best goes down the track to loft Giles for a glorious straight six - the first of the series. A revenge shout for leg-before later in the over is missing leg stump as Best goes on the sweep. \"Andrea has got it spot on,\" writes Tristan H-B. \"I am the very same. I thought she was in the pub. I am listening to Sigur Ros, and heading to a local hostelry myself in about 15 minutes.\" 75th over: West Indies 289-7 (Best 3, Sanford 0) Maybe 300 wasn't so wide of the mark after all. WICKET! Jacobs c Vaughan b Jones 38 (289-7) A real gift for Jones as Jacobs clips a leg-stump half-volley straight to Vaughan at mid-on. England are just clawing their way back into things here. \"I just thought I'd email you as a) I'm bored and b) I thought you might be, too,\" writes the highly considerate Dan Herbert. \"It's just not cricket that you are paid to watch England futz around for five days. I'm in Paris and watching a devastatingly dull TV show called \"100 minutes to convince\" -- a political debate show ahead of regional elections. I was convinced many minutes ago that I ought to be watching the football - do you feel the same way or are you generally happy with your lot?\" That's all a bit deep for this time in the evening, isn't it, Dan? If you must know, I'm moderately content, although I'd be much happier if the West Indies tail did the decent thing and surrendered quickly. 74th over: West Indies 287-6 (Jacobs 37, Best 3) Jacobs pinches a single with a tuck round the corner off Giles, who is bowling with a lot more composure than he did when his first two overs were costing 20. Best works him through midwicket for two with a neat clip off his toes. 73rd over: West Indies 284-6 (Jacobs 36, Best 1) Not much doing in that Jones over. I'm not flagging, honest. \"Is Tristan Haley-Burrows the same Tristan Haley-Burrows whose two friends from London went to school with Michael Vaughan?\" wonders Andrea Lowe. \"Although, being realistic, how many Tristan Haley-Burrowses can there be?\" 72nd over: West Indies 281-6 (Jacobs 34, Best 0) England are into the tail now. They could still be batting before the day is out: there are still 18 overs to go on a day of lethargic over-rates. \"Larry the lamb,\" points out Kat Brown. \"Someone had to say it.\" Thanks, Kat. WICKET! Hinds c Butcher b Giles 84 (281-6) Hinds goes on the sweep, but he gets a top edge and Butcher is waiting at short fine leg, where he takes a good, tumbling catch. Giles has now got rid of the two top-scorers. \"With play in the South Africa vs NZ game due to recommence in 10 minutes, your blokes biffing the Windies through the wee hours and the Aussies stuffing the Lankans over night, there is Test cricket being played almost every hour of the day and night. Life doesn't get any better than this,\" coos the possibly Australian Mike Thorn. \"Am taking my girlfriend to a romantic cottage in the country for the weekend. Am seriously considering taking my laptop to keep in touch with all this cricket. Do you think this is wise?\" No. 71st over: West Indies 276-5 (Hinds 83, Jacobs 30) Hinds is upright in the crease as he drives Jones though mid-on for four - a stroke that purrs all the way to the boundary. That brings up the fifty stand, which means that I'm now reassessing my estimate that the Windies should be bowled out for less than 300. Make that 350. \"Laurence Welk,\" suggests Lee Linthicum, who has a name to be proud of himself. I reckon you're all just doing Google searches. Laurence Welk? I ask you! 70th over: West Indies 270-5 (Hinds 78, Jacobs 29) Jacobs goes down on one knee to caress Giles through the covers for four - a stroke of unusual delicateness. \"How can somebody by the name of Tristan Haley-Burrows talk about being gypped at birth?\" wonders Andi John Thomas. 69th over: West Indies 264-5 (Hinds 77, Jacobs 24) The highlight of that over is a Jones beamer that wasn't even on target. It looks like a slower ball gone hideously wrong, and everyone has a laugh. Except for Hinds, who would have picked up four runs if he had made contact with his cut shot. The game's going through one of its rare quiet phases. \"Paul Headon (62nd Over) is correct in assuming I don't remember that one fight,\" writes Mark Tookey. \"However, I do remember when Colin \"Nutter\" Evans decided it would be a good idea to play darts standing not at the oche but some 10 yards further away (ie behind the bar). Quite how that evening didn't end with someone needing 63 stitches is beyond me.\" 68th over: West Indies 262-5 (Hinds 77, Jacobs 23) Giles returns and that's a better over to Hinds, who is getting jumpy in sight of his maiden Test hundred. Just one off the over. \"Llewellyn-Bowen,\" points out Tristan Haley-Burrows. Yes, yes, but apart from etc etc. And thanks to the tens of thousands who have emailed in to point out the existence of Laurence Olivier. It's the sort of oversight a man can make after 65 overs of non-stop commentary... 67th over: West Indies 261-5 (Hinds 76, Jacobs 23) Jacobs tonks - for that is the only word - Jones over wide mid-on for three, and Jones looks to the heavens as if to say, 'why my boyo?' Jacobs has played a crucial little innings here - just ensuring that the Windies lost no momentum following the demise of Smith. \"Laurence Fishburne?\" suggests Andi Thomas. \"Sir Laurence Olivier? Erm ... that's about it, methinks.\" Ok, ok. But apart from Fishburne and Olivier, name me a single famous Laurence. 66th over: West Indies 257-5 (Hinds 75, Jacobs 20) Jacobs is in no mood to hang around. He flukes a couple to third man with a sort of lofted outside edge off Flintoff, before working him in more orthodox fashion through midwicket for two more. The run-rate shows no sign of abating. Your emails, however, are another matter. 65th over: West Indies 249-5 (Hinds 75, Jacobs 12) Back comes Jones, who was earlier called \"the strong Welshman\" by Bob Willis. Fans of elegant variation will understand why I've even bothered to mention that. Anyway, three singles edge the Windies closer to 250. Tristan Haley-Burrows plainly has too much time on his hands. \"I have variously wondered through the day whether you feel the good lord gypped you, by the spelling of your given name,\" he twitters. \"Lawrence always seemed quite ITV to me, with Laurence a much more stately BBC.\" On the contrary, Tris. All the best Lawrences are Lawrence: DH, TE, and many more I could mention but don't have the time to. Name me a single famous Laurence. 64th over: West Indies 246-5 (Hinds 73, Jacobs 11) Flintoff overpitches and Hinds plays a sumptuous drive for four through mid-off. Great shot. A leg gulley is posted for Jacobs, but the predictable rib-tickler is helped fine for a single. 63rd over: West Indies 240-5 (Hinds 68, Jacobs 10) Jacobs frees his arms to smash Harmison over the top of mid-off for four. That was a typically unfettered Jacobs shot - as is the flick over square-leg two balls later. That was a poor ball. 62nd over: West Indies 231-5 (Hinds 68, Jacobs 2) Flintoff replaces Harmison (17-5-46-1), but is immediately greeted with a Hinds cover-drive which bounces awkwardly in front of Jones and away for four. England need to break this partnership quickly. \"Mark Tookey clearly wasn't at Aidan's when one of the Cuth's team decided to prove how hard he was by breaking a bottle over his own head,\" writes Paul Headon. \"Fun for all the family, that was - 63 stitches, if I remember correctly.\" 61st over: West Indies 226-5 (Hinds 63, Jacobs 2) Hinds moves to his highest Test score of 63 with a scrambled single off Harmison that almost results in the run-out of Jacobs as Vaughan slides in from short midwicket. Jacobs can bat, but there's not much else. England should still be looking to dismiss the Windies for less than 300... 60th over: West Indies 225-5 (Hinds 62, Jacobs 2) That brought to an end a stand of 122 between Smith and Hinds. Next man in is the wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs, who pushes his first ball through the covers for two. \"Just thought you might like to know it's not just Oxbridge inter-collegiate darts that's so exciting and violent,\" reports Mark Tookey. \"My old college's (St. Aidan's, Durham) darts team had a few famous evenings, most notably when a match had to be abandoned due to fighting caused by a supporter of the rival College team insisting to one of Aidan's porters that his wife was of less than perfect sexual fidelity.\" WICKET! Smith st Read b Giles 108 (223-5) Soon after dancing down the track to hammer Giles through extra cover for four, Smith overbalances on the sweep and isn't aware that his back foot is in front of the line as Read whips off the bails. England needed that. Desperately. 59th over: West Indies 214-4 (Smith 104, Hinds 57) Harmison almost gets a yorker through Hinds's defences, but he squeezes it out to third man for one run. Some of the devil seems to have gone out of the pitch, so it's probably just as well that Brian Lara was dismissed before lunch. \"The most expensive restaurant in the UK is Sketch in Belgravia,\" reports Andrew Belgrave, before lapsing into near-despair. \"How often have England done this? Started strongly and then let the game slip away in the second and third sessions.\" All too often, Andrew. All too often. 58th over: West Indies 213-4 (Smith 104, Hinds 56) England just need to remember that two more wickets and they're into a very long tail that begins with Tino Best at No8. All is not lost, even if my commentary occasionally hints at doom and gloom. For the time being, though, Giles is doing his best to give his figures a respectable sheen. He's not turning it much - no tittering at the back - but he conceded only a single off that over. Steve Hart has an update on the latest odds: \"13/8 West Indies, 5/4 Draw, 5/2 England.\" Thanks, Steve. 57th over: West Indies 212-4 (Smith 104, Hinds 55) Harmison switches ends, and even manages to bowl a maiden. Things must be looking up. \"You're late,\" says RJ Pharoah. No I'm not. 56th over: West Indies 212-4 (Smith 104, Hinds 55) Vaughan is chopping and changing now, and it all feels a bit desperate. Giles is the latest bowler to enter the line of fire. Two off the over is a minor miracle. Here's that bundle of joy, Dave Tarrant. \"Wondering if you keep a counter of how many people are actually logged in at any one time?\" he asks. \"Probably a little risky for morale - I mean, how enthusiastic would you be if you discovered that only four people were on-line and three of them were using you as a noticeboard to discuss varsity darts?\" Only four, Dave? I'd kill for half as many. 55th over: West Indies 210-4 (Smith 103, Hinds 54) Smith's hundred took 167 balls, by the way, and included 17 fours. I tell you this only for the record. A Hoggard no-ball, harshly called by Umpire Harper, brings up the West Indies 200, before Hinds hammers Hoggard through extra cover for four. What a shot! Next ball, Hinds moves to fifty with a work for two through midwicket. He needed just 68 balls - and he's helped turn this game round. Next ball disappears for three through mid-off. Groan. \"Seeing how this is going, do you think we should click over to Barry's minute-by-minute coverage?\" asks Kevin Hession. Barry says that no matter how bad the cricket gets, Kevin, it can't be as bad as his minute--by-minute. If I know Barry, and I'm sorry to say that I do, I reckon he's just being modest. 54th over: West Indies 200-4 (Smith 103, Hinds 45) Hinds plays an elegant uppercut for four off Harmison, then repeats the stroke for a single that brings up the Windies 200. It's been one-way traffic since Hoggard bowled Chanderpaul. \"What've yer had for tea, Lawrence?\" asks Steve Hart, showing a touching interest in my wellbeing. I've been nibbling since about 6pm, Steve. A yoghurt, an apple, a brie-and-cranberry baguette and a banana. And I'm still hungry. 53rd over: West Indies 195-4 (Smith 103, Hinds 40) Hinds moves to 99 with a dab for two, then pulls Hoggard for four to complete his maiden Test century. A great shot to complete an increaingly fluent hundred. He was lucky to escape a shout for leg-before early on in his innings, but he's gone for his strokes since then. Well played. \"Sadly I represented the Wadham 2nd team darts, ie less skilful but more witty with the banter. I played in 1998, 1999 and 2000, if that helps. That said, I don't recall any such fights with Corpus; only with Magdalen who cheated.\" Oxbridge darts has never had such exposure! 52nd over: West Indies 189-4 (Smith 97, Hinds 40) Right, here we go again. Steve Harmison is into the attack, and immediately concedes a single to Hinds, who gloves him unconvincingly to square leg. Smith moves to 97 with a dab to third man for one, before Hinds takes two more to square-leg. If everything goes to plan, the Windies should pass 300 easily before the day is out. Matthew Sackman plainly has little regard for my professionalism. \"So if you're in London then are you getting paid extra to spend half the night there?\" he asks. \"If not, are you allowed to drink? If so, are you allowed to drink?\" I fear I might need a stiff brandy come the end of the day's play, Matthew."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
