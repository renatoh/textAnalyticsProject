The issue of how best to respond to Trump\u2019s announcement is at the centre of a series of emergency meetings of senior Palestinian leaders, which began on Saturday. They are expected to conclude early next week with a rare meeting of the PLO central council, and have already concluded that Abbas should not meet vice president Mike Pence when he visits Israel and Palestine just before Christmas. Confirming the decision that Abbas would not meet Pence, the Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki said Palestinians would also seek votes on resolutions at the UN security council and Arab League. Although the US has a veto on the security council, support for drafting a resolution would be seen as pressuring the US. The fraught Palestinian deliberations \u2013 which are taking place amid widespread Muslim and international anger over Trump\u2019s unilateral move that broke international diplomatic consensus \u2013 come as Palestinian medical sources confirmed two members of Hamas had been killed in an Israeli air strike following a missile launch from Gaza, bringing the death toll in the last two days to four. Despite widespread fury, however, the Palestinian leader has been caught between his anxiety to avoid an escalation of violence, amid calls by some for a new intifada \u2013 or uprising \u2013 and his need to make a meaningful response. But in a boost for Abbas, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron agreed they would work together to try to persuade the United States to reconsider its decision, following a phone call focusing on the risks to stability in the region. The conversation between Erdo\u011fan and Macron followed hard on the heels of a meeting of the UN security council in which an isolated US struggled to defend accusations from European countries that its action was in breach of UN resolutions. And as the diplomatic crisis continued, an increasing chorus of voices was asking precisely what Trump had actually achieved, as evidence of damage to the US standing in the Middle East and international forums continued to mount. If there was one place at the weekend where no doubt had been allowed to enter, however, it was in Trump\u2019s estimation of what he had achieved. On Thursday, as he greeted his guests to mark the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, he indulged himself again with a moment of invited congratulation. \u201cWell, I know for a fact there are a lot of happy people in this room,\u201d he told the guests, before adding to a ripple of applause: \u201cJerusalem.\u201d While Trump has been basking in both self- and mutual admiration of his decision to upend decades of US foreign policy by recognising Jerusalem \u2013 a city claimed both by Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 as the Israeli capital, across the Middle East US diplomats, their families and other citizens were contemplating the coming holidays in a region suddenly more hostile to America. In Jordan and elsewhere \u2013 according to reports \u2013 diplomats\u2019 children were advised not to go to school, other movements were heavily restricted and meetings cancelled as the anger over a 13-minute speech continued to reverberate in flag burnings and demonstrations. In Israel \u2013 beyond the euphoria of the rightwing political elites \u2013 the decision was greeted with little more than an anxious shrug, the rain-slicked streets of west Jerusalem empty of celebrations even in the immediate aftermath of Trump\u2019s declaration. Instead, the emotional energy has been concentrated almost exclusively on a single side \u2013 the sense of outrage among Palestinians and the wider Muslim community that Trump had sought to give away something that was not his to give. There have been condemnations, statements and threats from groups as diverse as Hezbollah, Hamas, al-Qaida and Iraqi militias both against the US and Israel. But the real impact for now is more likely to be felt at a more granular level in a city where even the smallest perceived changes to its status or the status of its religious sites can detonate sudden explosions of violence. In recent years there has been a wave of stabbing attacks attributed in part to fears that Israel planned to change the status of the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount compound, and there were two weeks of street protests this summer after Israel installed metal detectors at the entrances to the same site following a lethal attack in the same compound. \u201cJerusalem is a time bomb,\u201d explained Hamdi Dyab, a Palestinian activist in Shuafat refugee camp, the only camp within the city\u2019s municipal limits last week, on the evening of Trump\u2019s speech. \u201cThis is an unprecedented escalation by the US president and it will detonate a third intifada. History will not have seen an intifada like this. Unfortunately it will jeopardise the interest of the US and the lives of US people all over the world if he does this. \u201cThe declaration has destroyed the peace process and all the agreements that have been signed. This will be met with a wave of public reaction. \u201cThe day before yesterday we met with Mr Abbas and we told him, as the people of Jerusalem we had won the 14 days of protests over al-Aqsa mosque [over the Israeli installation of metal detectors] and we are telling the Americans that, as the people who ran those protests, Jerusalem will always stay Islamic with its heritage and its culture. \u201cWe had a meeting between all the Palestinian factions in Ramallah headed by Fatah, and Hamas also. If Trump declares Jerusalem as capital of Israel an intifada will spread all over the West Bank and also including the green line.\u201d For many Palestinians last week \u2013 already deeply disillusioned with the international policies of the weak and ageing Abbas \u2013 Trump\u2019s speech was seen as final evidence of failure. Even those not critical suggested the time had come for a new approach. \u201cAbu Mazen [Abbas\u2019s nickname] is 83 but it is time to take a courageous decision and write his name in history. They have left no choice for him. All he can do is lead a third intifada,\u201d said Sheikh Abdullah al-Qam, a coordinator of the Jerusalem committee representing Palestinian factions in east Jerusalem. And while Israel so far does not see the risk of Abbas\u2019s Fatah party taking the kind of active role seen during the second intifada, what it does fear is that Hamas \u2013 which called for an intifada last week \u2013 might seek to exploit anger to bolster its own position. More likely still, security officials fear, is a return to the sporadic deadly violence of the wave of knife attacks, often launched by Palestinian individuals without warning, that only recently died down. Another unintended consequence, and potentially more serious, is how Trump\u2019s move will affect a wider region where Sunni Arab allies have complained about America\u2019s declining influence even as Russia and Iran have rapidly extended theirs. In the final analysis, there is only one clear beneficiary of Trump\u2019s controversial speech, as Aluf Benn, editor-in-chief of the liberal Israeli daily Haaretz, argued in a commentary on Friday. In it, he wrote that Trump had both helped Benjamin Netanyahu deflect attention from a series of corruption investigations, and reflected a US shift in focus from the Middle East to Asia. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t give the Palestinians anything in return,\u201d wrote Benn, \u201cand even weakened America\u2019s commitment to the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state. \u201cNetanyahu knows that Israel\u2019s existence and security depend on US support, so he fears an American withdrawal. But he also knows that Israel can\u2019t stop this process or even delay it, so instead he\u2019s trying to mine it for opportunities to improve Israel\u2019s position in its uncompromising conflict with the dying Palestinian national movement. Trump\u2019s speech on Wednesday was just such an opportunity.\u201d Writing for the Israeli site Walla, Amir Oren was even more damning, warning that Trump\u2019s declaration would have a \u201ccost in blood\u201d, either in the form of a \u201cTrump intifada\u201d or in a series of terror attacks. \u201cEvery needless fatality that follows in the wake of this childish whim \u2026 will be Trump\u2019s responsibility, and indirectly the responsibility of those who encouraged him, by action or inaction.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
