In the past decade, they have challenged Shell, Trafigura, BP, Xstrata, Anglo American and Unilever, as well as the British and Japanese governments. In that time they have carved out a reputation for being the scourge of the corporates and a fierce upholder of human rights. \u201cWe work in the dark, inhospitable corners of the world where miners, oil and mineral companies and governments can often get away with what they could not if they were working in Britain,\u201d says Day. \u201cThe multinationals recognise now that if we take them on, we do so seriously. We put the spotlight on them because they should be treating people in places like Bodo in Nigeria in the same way as they would people in Birmingham.\u201d The former chairman of Greenpeace UK now has 10 teams working in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Peru, Kenya and elsewhere. The firm will invest millions in a case and take up to 50 lawyers and paralegals to a country to collect witness statements. It has worked for children with leukaemia near Sellafield, former British prisoners of war in Japan and Kenyan people imprisoned during the Mau Mau rebellion. As one of the very few international law firms prepared to take on the most powerful companies over human rights and the environment, Leigh Day specialises in Africa and developing countries. \u201cHistorically, our judiciary used to hate these cases. Now the judges are more internationally aware and interested,\u201d says Day, who runs the international team of around 80 lawyers. \u201cI lived in Zambia as a child. It was the beginning of what I became. I got angry seeing blacks being treated like shit.\u201d While Day has seen some major coups, wringing \u00a315m last year out of Shell for pollution in the Niger delta and an undisclosed settlement for 30,000 Ivorians affected by chemical pollution, the firm has lost major cases, too. The most embarrassing was the al-Sweady inquiry in 2014, when Leigh Day represented nine Iraqi soldiers who claimed that the UK army had tortured and murdered detainees following the Battle of Danny Boy in 2004. But the case fell apart with the disclosure of a letter showing that some of the Iraqis were part of the Mahdi army. The judge concluded that the most serious allegations were \u201cdeliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility\u201d. Day says: \u201cMaybe the Iraqis were fantastic liars. It seems they hoodwinked us. We were criticised by the minister in parliament. Perhaps I am a shit lawyer, but I stand by the fact that [the allegations] warranted an inquiry. If you put your head above the parapet, they will shoot. We do high-profile cases. We make big enemies. When they get a chance, they have a go at us.\u201d Day started with a trade union law firm, from which he was sacked \u201cfor causing trouble\u201d, and went on to London law firm Bindmans, where he went on strike for a day over what he thought was the clerks\u2019 low pay. \u201cI was a bolshie bastard. My skill in life is as a troublemaker,\u201d he says. But the firm has grown by 20% a year for a decade, now has 400 lawyers and 34 partners and is Britain\u2019s largest firm of criminal neglect lawyers. Day now receives almost one request each day to investigate a potential corporate or government wrongdoing. \u201cWe attract driven young lawyers. We have fabulous contacts with NGOs. I need people who are driven,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do big and unusual cases. We want to act for people who have serious problems.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
