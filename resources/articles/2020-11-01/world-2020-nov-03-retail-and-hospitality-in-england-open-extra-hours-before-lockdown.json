Gary Grant, the chairman of toyshop chain The Entertainer, said shoppers were \u201cclearing the shelves like it\u2019s Christmas Eve\u201d with sales on Monday double that of the equivalent day last year. The chain is extending opening hours until 7pm or 8pm from 5.30pm as it expects strong trading to continue right up until Wednesday night. From Thursday, nonessential retail in England will close for a month, along with gyms, cinemas, hospitality venues and places of worship. Dixons, the owner of PC World, Currys and Carphone Warehouse, and some branches of bookseller Waterstones are also extending opening hours ahead of four weeks of closure in what would normally be a peak trading period. Queues formed outside Primark in some cities over the weekend as the chain, which does not sell online, prepared to close its doors on Thursday. Across England there was a near 9% rise in shopper numbers compared with the previous week. However, the number of high street visitors is still well down on last year, including 45% down in central London. Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of the New West End Company trade body for London retailers, described the scene as a \u201cmini rush\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of the best Sundays since we reopened,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people want to get some shopping done as they are not certain shops are going to reopen in December.\u201d Hairdressers around the country were also busy. Regis, which owns 56 hair salons, said bookings were up 30% since the lockdown announcement on Saturday and the 60-strong Saks hairdressing chain said it had extended opening hours to include Sunday, early mornings and late evenings to cope with demand. Janet King, the head of marketing at Saks, said: \u201cPhones are ringing off the hook and our online booking app has struggled a little with the volume of traffic.\u201d Darren Messias, the managing director of KH Hair Salons, said its 20 salons in the Midlands would be doing a week\u2019s appointments in three days by bringing in extra staff and opening late in some cases as clients booked in for emergency dyes and trims. \u201cThe fear is that the government might extend the lockdown. People are panicking about getting their colours done for Christmas,\u201d he said. Pubs were also expecting a late rush. Peter Borg-Neal, the chief executive of Oakman Inns, said its 28 pubs were fully booked through to Wednesday night, from when the group will only be able to sell takeaway meals. He said the group was hoping to sell as much beer as possible before the lockdown as pubs will not be able to sell takeaway alcohol from Thursday as they were allowed to do in the spring lockdown. \u201cWe will have a big lump of stock left over. Probably 200 pints per pub. Why don\u2019t they at least let us try to make some form of living. Why do they always favour the supermarkets?\u201d Borg-Neal said. Restaurants also reported a surge in bookings. Gaucho said it had taken 8,000 bookings for its steakhouses on Sunday, four times its usual number, while Rick Stein Group said its bookings on Sunday were up by 25% week on week. Ben Tish, the culinary director of hotel and restaurant owner The Stafford Collection, said its Norma restaurant in central London was fully booked for evenings until Thursday with minimal space at lunches. \u201cPeople absolutely want their last hurrah,\u201d he said. Many galleries, museums and arts venues also reported a rise in inquiries from those wanting a last minute cultural hit. The Wigmore Hall in London, for example, experienced a flood of phone calls about coming to what is the final performance in its series to socially distanced audiences. \u201cPeople are desperate to get in,\u201d said the artistic director, John Gilhooly, \u201cbut unfortunately they can\u2019t because we\u2019re sold out.\u201d Instead, they can watch the free live stream of a grimly appropriate last performance: Schubert\u2019s Winterreise (Winter Journey), a downbeat song cycle about entering the abyss. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s not where we\u2019re heading,\u201d said Gilhooly. All the business owners said the short-term surge in trade would not offset a difficult year with the latest four-week shutdown a further blow after at least three months of closure from March. \u201cThis year is going to be shocking,\u201d said Messias at KH. \u201cEverybody is in the same boat. The high street is being absolutely murdered. It is very, very tough.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
