The move by the Institute of Fundraising follows the scandal that last month hit two breast cancer charities, sparking intervention by the charity watchdog and the courts. Breast Cancer Research (Scotland) had its assets frozen by the courts after it was found that \u00a35m of the \u00a313.2m it raised had been paid to a commercial fundraiser, Solutions RMC. The charity commission sent in a receiver and manager to run another Solutions RMC client, English charity Breast Cancer Relief, which spent less than 10% of its multi-million pound income on charitable work. The institute is proposing that commercial fundraisers should be regulated by the new body, as should individual professional fundraisers and charity fundraising. The head of the independent commission will be Rodney Buse, vice-chairman of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and a former member of the Deakin commission on the future of the voluntary sector. The first stage of his work will be a two-month scoping study, examining a range of options from ensuring compliance with \"basic acceptable standards\" to imposition of fines and active assessment of donors' experiences using \"mystery shoppers\". Buse says the regulatory body is likely to award \"some sort of visible quality mark\". It will look also at whether to adopt a similar model to the office of fair trading. The institute, which will fund a third of the project costs, currently relies on members agreeing to abide by its fundraising standards. \"We recognise that there are weaknesses in the models we have been involved in developing,\" says chief executive Lindsay Boswell. A self-regulatory body was first mooted last September in a review of charities by the government's strategy unit. The review report highlighted public concern about fundraising and proposed an independent scheme with accreditation, a code of good practice and a logo to be used by accredited organisations. The report said the body should investigate complaints from the public and, if necessary, apply sanctions - \"naming and shaming and ultimately expulsion from the scheme\". The strategy unit called for statutory measures should self-regulation prove \"ineffective\". The charities minister, Lord Filkin, welcomes the institute's initiative. \"It is important that the public have confidence in fundraising charities and other voluntary organisations,\" he says. \"This means ensuring good practice in fundraising. Fundraising, after all, is the public face of charity.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
