Even at the end the US champion, playing in the form of his life at age 32, was one up with two to play before Carlsen won the final blitz game then set up an impregnable fortress with the black pieces in the Armageddon game, which gave him a draw on the board and the full point under the match rules. It was a truly remarkable success for Nakamura, whose surging career as a streamer has gained him half a million followers on Twitch. This contrasted with his years in slow classical chess when he was Carlsen\u2019s customer with at one time 12 defeats against a solitary win. Nakamura is a different animal at 15-minute rapid and five-minute blitz and even more so at one-minute bullet, and in this match he adopted a psychological approach which paid off brilliantly. His technique was to prepare the opening well, then play reasonable moves that took little time on the clock. Carlsen is normally faster than his opponents but in several games he seemed rattled by his opponent\u2019s confidence and played too slowly. A second factor that aided the American was his resilience in difficult positions, a former weakness in his game which he has worked hard to improve. Both players had offboard problems. During the second set Nakamura\u2019s webcam failed and this contributed to his defeat, while just before the start of the sixth set Carlsen injured his back while on the beach in Denmark. He grimaced frequently, but still played some of his best chess of the match. With online audiences estimated in the tens or hundreds of thousands, the match captivated the spectators. There are problems for the future, though. Only a handful of players are involved in the top online events, while most of the grandmasters whose over-the-board careers have been derailed by the virus are excluded. Fide, the global chess body, is still struggling to find a way to complete the Candidates which was stopped at halfway in April and which should produce an official challenger to Carlsen. England\u2019s chances of reaching the knockout stage of the 163-nation online Olympiad hang by a thread after the first day (of three) brought a lucky narrow 3.5-2.5 win over Turkey, a 1-5 disaster against Croatia, and a hollow 4.5-1.5 victory over Algeria, who defaulted three of the six games. Russia, the No 1 seeds, have cruised through their three matches, while Armenia look set for second. The final qualifying place is likely to be contested among Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. England have just a slim chance, further diminished by their inferior game points tie-break. The Olympiad is the England team\u2019s only event in 2020, following their vintage 2019 silver medal performance at the world teams. However, the Olympiad\u2019s format of six-player teams with two men, two women and two juniors favours the Russian, Asian and east European squads where women\u2019s chess is a serious professional game. After three rounds India lead group A, Azerbaijan group B, and Russia group C, with group D, where the United States are top seeds, to be decided late on Friday. England\u2019s 3.5-2.5 win over Turkey consisted of five draws and a win on the junior board by Matthew Wadsworth, who recovered from a bad position. The failure against Croatia even included England\u2019s normally reliable grandmaster duo of Michael Adams and Luke McShane. Adams lost in his favourite Marshall Gambit to Ivan Saric, the 2018 European champion. England\u2019s No 1 woman, Jovanka Houska, was unlucky against Croatia when, a pawn up, she overstepped the time limit. Earlier, in last weekend\u2019s preliminary pool, Houska won a highly entertaining game where her opening knowledge of an offbeat variation (4 Nc3!) led to a lively king hunt. England\u2019s matches this Saturday and Sunday start at 3pm, 4pm and 5pm.
