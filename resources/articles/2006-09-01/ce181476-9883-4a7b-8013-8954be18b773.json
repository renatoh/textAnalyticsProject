The overwhelming majority of scientific opinion recognises that global warming is a reality and that humankind is responsible. As a result of carbon compounds emitted into the atmosphere the world, on its current trajectory, will get up to six degrees hotter this century, with drastic consequences. One example: the Arctic ice sheet receded by 280,000 square miles between 2004-2005. At that rate the North Pole will be ice-free in the lifetime of many of us. The oceans will rise faster than even pessimistic environmental campaigners have feared. Apocalyptic pictures can sap the will to take urgent action. But there are grounds for optimism. First, we know what the problem is. Global warming has not been visited upon us like a biblical plague. We are able to cut the amount of carbon we produce. It may be politically complex, but it is scientifically possible. Second, the political obstacles are fewer than they were even a year ago. In Britain, environmental debate is mainstream. The Liberal Democrats, whose conference runs this week, deserve the most credit for a long-standing commitment to the environment. They have detailed green policies and deserve credit for their honesty in identifying the most effective instrument for bringing about change - the tax regime. David Cameron has made the Tory party a late but zealous convert to the environmental cause and for this he, too, deserves credit. His photogenic Arctic explorations and enthusiasm for cycling have been dismissed by rivals as stunts, but the net effect has been to up the ante among all parties in the competition to be greenest. This is no bad thing. Labour's record is mixed. Britain is on track to meet its targets on carbon emission under the Kyoto Protocol, but the government has abandoned the more stringent targets it set itself. Tony Blair fought to put environmental issues on the agenda when he chaired the G8 summit last year, but international accord to cut emissions is barely closer as a result. There is no denying the awkwardness of decisions governments have to make on energy provision. They often reflect tangled arguments within the environmental movement. Nuclear power stations, for example, may not contribute as much as coal burning to global warming, but the waste is still toxic. However, complexity is not an excuse for inaction. Devising realistic policies always requires a trade-off between lesser and greater evils. Britain needs new nuclear power stations. This is the only way to provide the volume of power that the country needs at an environmental cost that is, relatively speaking, manageable. Similarly, stifling the cheap flight boom will hit tourism. But the effect of carbon emitted at altitude by thousands of planes criss-crossing the globe is too great to ignore. Aviation fuel, currently untaxed, must have a green levy put on it. Only when airlines come under financial pressure will they look in earnest for alternative ways to fuel flying. Meanwhile, major investment is needed in alternative energies such as tidal and wind power and in carbon capture and storage. Planning regulations need to be completely rewritten so that new houses and businesses are developed to emit less carbon. Such steps have already been taken in Northern Ireland, as Secretary of State Peter Hain writes in today's Observer Road use can no longer be free. While some rural drivers depend on their cars, many journeys are not necessary. Their environmental impact should be recognised in tolls. These are not perfect policies, but they could make a positive difference to all of us. And that, surely, is what the political parties drawing up plans in conferences over the next three weeks, should be trying to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
