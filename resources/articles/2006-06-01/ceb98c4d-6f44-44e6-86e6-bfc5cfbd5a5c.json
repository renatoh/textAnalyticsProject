For Argentina, the outstanding team of the first round, Javier Mascherano is the almost invisible but highly effective shield in front of the back four. For Ghana it is Michael Essien, fulfilling for his country the role that he may one day inherit from Claude Makelele at Chelsea. For Germany the job is done by Torsten Frings, while the Brazilian-born Marcos Senna is the man for Spain. Selecting the right player, or sometimes players, is crucial to the overall dynamic. Nothing has contributed as much to France's manifold problems in their opening games as Raymond Domenech's decision to restrict Makelele's influence by pairing him with the sadly diminished Patrick Vieira. And Brazil's failure to turn the ageing Emerson and converted winger Ze Roberto into an effective double pivot has been among the factors hindering the full expression of the team's gifts. In this respect England's adherence to a flat midfield quartet has made them look prehistoric -- although that might be unfair to the past, since even Alf Ramsey recognised the need for a Nobby Stiles. But the best of today's ball-winners are far more flexible, adaptable and discreet than the men who created the old stereotype. The likes of Mascherano and Makelele are so attuned to the rhythms and angles of the game, and so adept at anticipation and interception, that they seldom need to commit a foul. Their presence can go almost unnoticed, particularly since their redistribution of the ball is achieved without the flamboyance that is the preserve of those who play higher up the field. Until today, at least, England have shown no signs of getting this message, partly because Sven-Goran Eriksson appears wedded to the generally admirable principle of picking his best individuals in their best positions, which means attempting to harness Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard as a midfield duo. Since both are physically strong, and since Gerrard never shirks a tackle, Eriksson chose to trust the pair's ability to compensate for the absence of a holding player. The final demolition of that idea came last Thursday, when England's midfield so manifestly failed to function effectively against Trinidad &amp; Tobago. At that point even the Swede's best friends in the media wondered what on earth had been the point of spending about \u00a320m on a former Serie A coach who had failed to bring even such a basic element of strategic sophistication to the team. As recently as three weeks ago, in England's final warm-up games, Eriksson was still experimenting with the notion of a holding midfield player and dickering with the choice between Michael Carrick, Hargreaves and Jamie Carragher. Players of vastly differing skills and talents, all three have been known and available to him throughout his time in England. A great holding midfield player -- which the French call a r\u00e9cup\u00e9rateur and the Italians a mediano incontrista -- can sometimes be manufactured but their instincts are surely inborn. Self-expression is not their goal, much less personal glory. Whether things are going well or badly, the very quietness of their game is a source of reassurance for their team-mates. But they are specialist players who need a coach committed to the importance of their role. Hargreaves, who replaces Gerrard in the line-up against Sweden tonight, believes he is just such a specialist, having served Bayern Munich in the role with some distinction for several trophy-winning seasons. \"That's my position, playing in that holding role, getting stuck in and winning tackles and laying it off,\" he said this week. \"Those are the things I can bring to a team and that I've been looking forward to doing. We've got incredible individuals in this squad. Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard are two of the best midfield players in the game. We need to make it so that we use their strengths, because they're so gifted going forward and passing. The ingredients are all there. It's just about finding the right mix.\" Uli Hoeness, Bayern's general manager, looked at the midfield alignment with which Eriksson began the tournament and believed it could never work. \"How can you have Joe Cole, Beckham, Gerrard and Lampard? It makes me ask, 'Who will be the defensive midfield player?' Everyone wants to run forward. If people had taken the time to watch Owen Hargreaves they would have seen that he has done extremely well for FC Bayern. He can do the same for England when he is given the chance.\" Hargreaves has won 31 caps since starting his international career five years ago but he has started a mere six games in that time. Usually he is brought on to plug a gap or solve a problem, not always an enviable task, and he has not always excelled, which is why his arrival against Paraguay, with seven minutes to go and the defence under severe pressure, was booed by some England fans. \"It was 1-0 when I came on and it was 1-0 when the game finished,\" he said, meaning that he had done his job. Given the opportunity to start a match, he believes he can do even better. Tonight will be his chance to show that it is not too late for England to catch up with the rest of this World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
