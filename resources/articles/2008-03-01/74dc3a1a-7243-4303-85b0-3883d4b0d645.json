The Chicago-based aircraft maker vented its fury as it filed a formal protest today with the US Government Accountability Office \u2013 a congressional body which has the power to order a re-think of the award. \"We felt there were serious flaws in the process,\" said Mark McGraw, head of Boeing's tanker division. \"We continue to believe we offered the most capable aircraft. We believe we were lower risk and we offered a lower price.\" The surprise decision to place the work with a European-dominated contractor has sparked a row in Washington, with influential members of Congress arguing that the deal is of strategic importance to national defence \u2013 and that it should be kept in America to protect jobs. Boeing said its victorious rival, a consortium of Eads and US-based Northrop Grumman, was given credits for excess capacity in its proposed tankers, even though this was outside the specifications set by the military. In its complaint, Boeing accused procurement officials of encouraging a \"stretched schedule\", only to mark Boeing down for its proposed timeline. It added that officials had inflated perceived Boeing risk factors and had altered its own assumptions to help the European consortium \u2013 including last-minute \"unrealistic\" changes to the where aircraft could be parked and the capacity of runways. \"We weren't complacent \u2013 we dotted every 'i' and crossed every 't'. We worked this very hard,\" said McGraw, rejecting suggestions that Boeing had suffered from arrogance in assuming it would be chosen. The Gao has 100 days to consider the protest but experts say that Boeing's move is a long shot. The Gao only sided with 27% of the 1,411 complaints about contract awards which it received last year. These contracts were sent back to government procurement officials for reconsideration \u2013 and only about three of them resulted in any relief to the plaintiff. However, even if Boeing loses its protest, the deal could still fall victim to political critics. Boeing has enlisted a powerful crew of allies on Capitol Hill, some of whom are ready to block the Eads award through legislation. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, the congressional chairman who shares control of the Pentagon's purse strings, threatened such a move last week. \"[A]ll this committee has to do is stop the money,\" he told US military officials. \"And this programme is not going to go forward.\" Boeing supporters in Congress have made an unabashedly protectionist case. Republican congressman Todd Tiahrt of Kansas singled out the UK's nationalised healthcare system as an unfair advantage to Eads. \"We give advantages to the UK, to France, to Germany that we don't have in America,\" Tiahrt said. Murtha and his colleagues are slated to unveil the annual defence spending bill next month, and a provision stopping the Eads contract may well be included. Today Eads chief executive Louis Gallois shrugged off Boeing's protest. \"We have the feeling that the process was very transparent and fair and professional,\" he said at the company's annual results conference in Paris. \"It is not by chance that we won, having won the last five (international) competitions for tankers. That is all I can say.\" Gallois insisted that he expected the $35bn contract to be profitable for Eads. \"We are not selling airplanes at a loss and we want to make money on every contract we have.\" Gallois was speaking as Eads unveiled a net loss of euros 446m compared with a net profit of euros 99m in 2006 after what the Eads chief executive acknowledged had been a \"tough year with many high profile challenges.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
