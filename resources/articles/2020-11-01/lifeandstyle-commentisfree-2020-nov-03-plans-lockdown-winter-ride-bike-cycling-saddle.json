But I would like to learn to ride a bike", "bodyText": "As England heads into lockdown again, I have one serious aspiration, and perhaps committing to it here will force me to follow through: I want to learn to ride a bike properly. Despite living in flat, cyclist-filled places for most of my 45 years, I am terrified of bicycles: oily, capricious bringers of danger, humiliation and mashed shins. Now, though, my lockdown bubblemate lives a 40-minute walk away, but a quick bike dash along a pretty cycle path. The streets are quiet, the erratic kids on scooters are back at school and there will never be a better time to face my fears. I can grasp the basic mechanics of how to make the pedals go round, but my abysmal coordination and balance mean that I have the dubious distinction of being the only person I know to have failed their cycling proficiency test. The memory of an embarrassed, incredulous maths teacher pulling me out of the flowerbed into which I had fallen (I was attempting the part of the test where you have to look over your shoulder to manoeuvre) is one of those scenes that replays on a loop in my mind on sleepless nights. I feel like the only adult alive who can\u2019t ride a bike, but I don\u2019t think I am. In non-pandemic times, many local authorities offer courses for adult beginners. In 2020, though, I am on my own, so my attempt to master the iron murder-horse started with a wobbly circuit of a car park, riding my husband\u2019s bike, last weekend. A few days later, I headed off for a tentative first solo trip. I pushed until I got to the cycle path, hopped on when no one was looking and pedalled nervously to my friend\u2019s house. It was \u2026 great? Fresh air, speed and, so far, no shin injuries: this bike business could catch on. I haven\u2019t tried looking over my shoulder yet, but maybe today is the day? Mr Robinson would be thrilled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
