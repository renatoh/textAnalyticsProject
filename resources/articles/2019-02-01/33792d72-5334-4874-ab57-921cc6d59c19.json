Perhaps a little part of that is due to the year in which Newcastle\u2019s midfielder of the moment spent every spare hour virtually living on an ice rink in Stockholm where his father, David, starred for Djurg\u00e5rden, one of Sweden\u2019s leading ice hockey teams. By the time he returned to north-east England and began playing football for North Shields juniors, Sean was still only five but, already, his game seemed unusually well calibrated. For one so young, his calmness under pressure suggested that something of the Stockholm ice had transported itself into his veins. Unbeknown to a primary school prodigy swiftly recruited by Newcastle\u2019s academy, his father\u2019s career had reached a sliding-doors moment. David Longstaff\u2019s talent was much coveted \u2013 he would become the first Great Britain ice hockey player to win 100 caps \u2013 and there were offers to emigrate to Canada from NHL sides. A new life on another continent beckoned but he and his wife Michelle \u2013 an excellent netball player \u2013 could not quite break the ties to north Tyneside where David, 44, is the player-coach of Whitley Warriors. Staying put dictated that Sean and his brother Matty \u2013 two years younger and another midfielder, impressing for Newcastle\u2019s Under-23s \u2013 were destined to concentrate on football rather than ice hockey. Already, Sean has emulated his uncle, the former winger Alan Thompson, in breaking into Newcastle\u2019s first team. The 21-year-old has spent part of this week telling television interviewers he is \u201cliving the dream\u201d after earning lavish plaudits in the course of the 12 appearances \u2013 eight in the Premier League \u2013 he has made for Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side this season. Since making his league debut as a substitute in the 4-0 Boxing Day defeat at Liverpool, highlights have included a key role in a January home win against Manchester City and his first league goal, scored in Tuesday\u2019s 2-0 home victory over Burnley. Longstaff\u2019s two-footed central-midfield skills have attracted the attention of the England Under-21 manager, Aidy Boothroyd, who seems certain to call him up to his next squad, not to mention numerous comparisons with another Geordie, the former Manchester United and England midfielder Michael Carrick. If the similarities in the pair\u2019s straight-backed running style are irresistible, they also share a certain serenity, namely that invaluable knack of appearing to always find time on the ball and rarely looking rushed or snatching at passes. Throw in vision and a varied passing range and we are in doppelg\u00e4nger territory but Ben\u00edtez emphasises some differences. \u201cI can see that [the Carrick likeness],\u201d says Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cBut, at this stage, Sean has more mobility and stamina. Certainly he has the technique and he can use both feet as well.\u201d There is always a danger in over-hyping a player, however promising, with such little experience, but there appears minimal danger of Longstaff\u2019s head being turned. \u201cFirst and foremost, Sean\u2019s a great lad,\u201d says the Newcastle winger Matt Ritchie. \u201cFrom the first day he came into our group to now he\u2019s exactly the same guy. Sean\u2019s going to have one hell of a career if he keeps his feet on the floor and keeps working. But he\u2019ll do that, no doubt about it. He\u2019s a top player and a fantastic lad.\u201d Longstaff has no England youth caps and had an unremarkable loan stint at Kilmarnock before being borrowed by League One Blackpool last season. It would prove a watershed. Gary Bowyer was particularly impressed by his goalscoring ability \u2013 with both feet. \u201cIt was Sean\u2019s goal return from midfield [nine] that was outstanding,\u201d says Blackpool\u2019s then manager. \u201cHe has this unbelievable knack of scoring, often from long range. He\u2019s got a fantastic engine and fitness, and his knowledge of the game is very good. He did brilliantly for Blackpool.\u201d Portsmouth wanted Longstaff on loan last summer but Ben\u00edtez retained him as midfield cover. When Jonjo Shelvey and Mo Diam\u00e9 were sidelined by injury and Ki Sung-yueng headed to Abu Dhabi with South Korea for the Asian Cup in late December, a big chance materialised. A little over two months on, Shelvey, Diam\u00e9 and Ki are sitting on the sidelines, while Ben\u00edtez\u2019s decision not to pursue a long-mooted January loan move for Benfica\u2019s Greece midfielder Andreas Samaris appears vindicated. \u201cRafa made a shrewd decision in keeping Sean in the fold,\u201d Bowyer says. \u201cSean\u2019s learned a lot from training under him and he\u2019s grabbed his chance. Now, there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be allowed to get carried away. That inner drive is there in Sean. \u201cAt Blackpool he had to cope with living away from home and he learned a hell of a lot about himself but, mentally, Sean is tough. He\u2019s also very level-headed; he\u2019s always looking to improve. There is so much more to come from him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
