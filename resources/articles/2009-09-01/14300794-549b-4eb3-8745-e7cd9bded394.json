In fact, it equates to an increase of about 3.6% per household. The 37% increase applies purely to the small portion of council tax that is retained by the borough council itself (after other bodies such as police, fire and county council get their share). This core portion, kept by the borough, is 9.58% of a household's council tax. The fares scheme would raise this to 13.1% of the pot (The day-tripping pensioners who are costing local councils dear, 1 August, page 9). \u2022\u2008An obituary of the writer Frank Deasy (21 September, page 35) gave his birth year as 1960.
