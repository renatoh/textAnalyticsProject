It tastes buttery and melts in the mouth, thanks to the ratio of coconut oil to flour. Make sure to include the sugar, as it gives the pastry a little more flavour and helps it to brown. I prefer the tofu-based filling to egg-based quiche; all the vegans and non-vegans I\u2019ve served it to love it. Makes eight 10cm tartlets Prep time: 20 mins for the pastry, plus 20 mins for the filling Bake time: 30 mins For the pastry 360g plain flour \u00bd tsp salt 20g caster sugar 215g organic extra-virgin coconut oil (not liquid \u2013 it should be room temperature and scoopable) 65-80g cold water A little vegan margarine For the filling 1 medium red onion, diced 150g tenderstem broccoli, chopped small 2\u00bd tbsp olive oil 430g soft or silken tofu (after water is drained) \u00bc tsp turmeric 2 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes \u00bc tsp Indian black salt (kala namak) Small handful of fresh basil \u00bd-\u00be tsp salt \u00bd-\u00be tsp black pepper To decorate 5 baby plum tomatoes 5 black olives Handful of pine nuts A little extra olive oil Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/375F/gas mark 5. For the pastry, mix all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add the coconut oil and use your fingers to rub it in until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the water to combine and form a ball. Try to work the pastry as little as possible. Place on to a lightly floured surface. Lightly flour the top and roll to about 2-3mm thick. Stamp out eight 12cm circles and use these to line your 10cm tart tins, lightly greased with the margarine. Trim off the excess pastry. Use the side of your finger to press the pastry around the fluted edge. Prick the bottom of the tart using a fork. Place in the fridge to chill. Fry the onions and the broccoli over a high heat with 1 tbsp oil, until softened and much reduced in size. Drain the water from the tofu, and add to a bowl along with the turmeric, nutritional yeast (crumble to a powder between your fingers), black salt, the remaining olive oil and the torn basil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the cooked vegetables and stir together. Set aside. Line the tart shells with aluminium foil then fill with baking beads or rice. Blind bake for 15 minutes with the foil on, then five minutes with the foil and beads removed. Add the filling, pressing it down to fit in as much as possible. Slice the tomatoes and olives and arrange on top, then brush with a little oil. Add the pine nuts to complete the face. Bake for a further 10 minutes or until the filling feels springy. Leave to cool in the tins for 10 minutes before removing and serving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
