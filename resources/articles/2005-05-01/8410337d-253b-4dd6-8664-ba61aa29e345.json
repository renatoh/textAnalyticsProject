Triumphant in his own eyes, perhaps. Yet, while it is true that he is generally loathed on all sides of the house, there is a sneaking admiration for his performance this week in front of \"the world's greatest deliberative body\", as the United States Senate styles itself, apparently without irony. We may be a minor power these days, and nobody much bothers to follow our debates, but when it comes to bombastic brow-beating, hectoring, bellowing, rant and cant, plus half-truths delivered with the weight and effect of stone tablets hurled at the senators, then your traditional British MP is still a world-beater. It's like our ceremonial. Nobody does it better than us, but we haven't yet noticed that no one else bothers to do it any more. Mr Galloway fell into friendly conversation with Gerald Howarth, who is the MP for Aldershot, and so represents many of the soldiers whom Mr Galloway accused of \"falling on Iraq like wolves\". It was this view - and his more or less open encouragement for people to shoot at British soldiers - that got him kicked out of the Labour party, though it didn't cause Mr Howarth to ignore him or even indicate any resentment; like the US senate, this is a very collegiate place. Was Galloway's permanent rage going to be banked by a great gungy outpouring of slavering goodwill? Possibly so. When it was his time to take the oath, he signed the book, then went on to chat animatedly to the Speaker, who grasped his hand, held it in a firm grip, and shook it five times. Whereas the other MPs who were clocking in got only four shakes (Dan Norris) or even three (Patrick Hall). Then Mr Galloway revealed the most important decision he had made - where to sit. He selected a bench on the opposition side, behind the Lib Dems, where he stayed for around two minutes. It was the political equivalent of a dog announcing its presence by peeing on a garden wall. And he was gone. I can't wait for his first speech. No doubt he will denounce all his fellow members as \"whores, poltroons, drunkards and lackeys of the baby-bombers Blair and Bush,\" after which they will line up to buy him drinks. The other event of the day was the discovery of laughing Geoff Hoon. The former provincial solicitor, who sent soldiers east with all the unexcited deliberation of a man reading out the result of a search, is now leader of the house and is reinvented as relaxed, amiable and funny. The mantle of dreariness has been handed over to his Tory opposite number, Chris Grayling. Mr Grayling has the air of one who is so bored by what he is saying that he might fall into the arms of Morpheus before he says it. There should be a verb for this: to grayle. \"I'm afraid Chris is being as grayling as ever,\" colleagues would say, banging their temples in a vain attempt to stay awake. But Mr Hoon was nimble, deft and lithe, smoothly deflecting trouble from everyone, including a Scottish Lib Dem, Alexander Carmichael, who, in the most predictable intervention of the day, complained that the new BBC weather map was unfair to Scotland. So successful was the new image that at one point the Tory MP Andrew Mitchell felt able to reveal that he had been one of Mr Hoon's closest friends since their days at Cambridge 30 years ago. This was such an unusual gesture of amity across the benches that we were not surprised when Mr Mitchell left his seat and went to chat with George Galloway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
