After giving ground earlier this month on schools admissions and the role of local authorities, the education secretary, Ruth Kelly, today rejected demands to further water down the legislation. Demands by rebel Labour MPs that local authorities should have the power to set up new schools without reference to the education secretary were rejected by the government. But the words \"trust schools\" - which ministers have adopted as the brand for their plans - do not appear anywhere in the legislation. Trust schools would instead be legally known as \"foundation schools with a foundation\". As MPs were left to digest the 200-page bill without a Commons statement by Ms Kelly it was unclear tonight how many of the potential 100 Labour rebels had been brought back onside by the government. Rebel MPs opposed to the bill under centre-left Labour thinktank Compass are meeting at Westminster to discuss how to take forward opposition to the bill. Organiser Neal Lawson said: \"There are still a pretty substantial figure - 80, 90 even a 100 MPs - opposed to this bill. There have haven't been any fundamental changes. \"Tonight's meeting will discuss tactics on where and how we go from here.\" Before publishing the bill in Westminster, Ms Kelly visited a school in west London. She said: \"I'm confident that this is a bill that my colleagues should be able to unite around. \"It is a very good bill. It gives schools the freedom they need to raise standards.\" The education secretary will tonight address the northern group of Labour MPs as ministers undertake a fresh round of lobbying. The proposals cover reforms to the way schools are run, measures to improve classroom discipline and new rules to make school meals healthier. The department for education said every school would have the chance to become a trust school, free from local authority control and able to manage its assets. Trust schools will be backed by businesses, faith groups, universities or other successful schools under the proposals, which were first outlined in a white paper last year. The original white paper proposals set out moves to strip local authorities of their power to create new community schools. Instead, local authorities were to have a new \"strategic\" role. The bill published today makes it clear that a local education authority in England, may with the consent of the secretary of state set up a new community school. Ms Kelly has insisted she would only use this power of veto rarely, and \"will not normally intervene\" where the council in question has a good track record and parents in the area want the new community school. Vera Baird, Labour MP for Redcar told Guardian Unlimited: \"I wasn't one of the original 100-strong rebels but I was somewhat unhappy at the bill and the concessions have gone some way towards solving that. I'm inclined to think the bulk of the problems are out of the way but I'm still worried about the veto.\" Schools minister Lord Adonis defended Ms Kelly's decision to retain her power to veto plans for local authorities to set up new community schools. \"Local authorities will only be able to set up those schools where they have a good track record in education, otherwise others who have the capacity to set up a good school will be in a better position to do so,\" he said. Clive Efford one of the 100 Labour rebels MPs who signed the alternative white paper promoted by Compass, said he wanted time to consider it. \"I picked up this bill five minutes ago with the intention of not voting for it. I will now go away and read it, but it is very difficult to confirm that the government have moved as far as it's said it has. I'm still concerned about getting the resources into low performing schools but we seem to have moved a long way away from the free for all disaster it would have been,\" he said. With the Conservatives indicating they will support the bill with reservations it was left to the Liberal Democrats to officially oppose the legislation. The Lib Dem education spokesman, Edward Davey, said: \"Despite the hype, these are limited reforms, containing hidden dangers that ought to alarm parents and schools across England. \"We will now study the fine print, but if ministers want the votes of Liberal Democrats they would be strongly advised before second reading to refocus on reforms proven to raise standards. \"Schools don't need to become trusts to get the benefits ministers promise, but if your local school adopts Labour's trust model you could find your children don't get a place. Labour wants schools to choose pupils, not parents to choose schools. That's a threat to parental choice.\" The 25-strong Socialist Campaign group of MPs immediately signaled they were still unhappy with the bill. Chairman John McConnell said: \"The bill remains unacceptable to any Labour MP seeking to ensure fair access to a decent education for all their constituents, rich or poor. \"Having secured a series of concessions so far, our strategy will be to await further government shifts - as even with those concessions the government cannot be sure of its majority.\" The chair of the education select committee, Barry Sheerman, said tonight: \"The bill is what I expected, and really we've had a very encouraging process and chronology of listening from the government. They've listened to my committee and they've listened to the people demanding clarity.\" Asked about the Compass meeting of rebels tonight, he said: \"The Labour party is a democratic party and if people have objections they shouldn't hold private meetings and chunter away, but come to the meeting of the parliamentary Labour party.\" Meanwhile the Tory education spokesman, David Willetts, confirmed that the Tories will be backing the bill - but warned that his party would be tabling an amendment to it. He said: \"This is a timid step in the right direction. Tony Blair said Labour was at its best when at its boldest. This bill would have been better if it had been bolder. \"We will try to improve the bill as it goes through the house so it lives up to the ambitions Tony Blair set out just a few months ago.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
