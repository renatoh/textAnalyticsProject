The Jambos have only conceded two goals in Premier-league matches at Tynecastle this season and look overpriced to share the points with Martin O'Neill's team. Gillingham to draw with Brighton in the Championship on Sunday at 9-4 with Bet365. The Gills beat Rotherham 3-1 at Priestfield last Saturday and were well backed to do so. Stan Ternent's men could follow up against Brighton, who have only won one of their last five matches. An away win is a top-priced 5-2 with Bet365 but a draw looks the safest call. West Ham to beat Nottingham Forest in the Championship on Sunday at 4-7 with Hill's. Forest are still without an away win in the Championship this season whereas the Hammers have won eight and drawn two of their 12 contests at Upton Park. Sheffield Wednesday to beat Walsall in League One on Sunday at even money with Bet Direct. Wednesday have won more games on the road than at home this season but they should beat the Saddlers who have managed just one away win from 11 league matches. Lincoln City to beat Boston United in League Two on Sunday at 11-5 with Hill's. The Imps are frustratingly inconsistent but only last month they recorded convincing wins against Yeovil and Darlington and are as short as 15-8 with Ladbrokes to be successful at Boston. Harchibald to win the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton Park on Sunday at evens with Stan James. Paul Carberry's mount was an impressive winner of the Fighting Fifth Hurdle last time out and the form of that race looks strong. Kempton's flat track should suit him and he is likely to have too much speed for the former champion Rooster Booster. The Houston Texans to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday at 10-11 with Bet365 receiving a 7.5-point start. The Texans are finishing the season on an upward curve and were a winning tip against Chicago last weekend, beating the Bears 24-5. They look favoured on the handicap in Florida. The Detroit Lions to beat the Chicago Bears on Sunday at 10-11 with Gamebookers conceding a 5.5-point start. Chicago were poor against Houston and the Lions, who came within a point of an upset against Minnesota, should be able to cover the line. Futures England, currently a best-priced 4-11 with Blue Square to win the Test series against South Africa, can be backed at 6-4 with Coral to be victorious in the second Test which begins in Durban on Boxing Day. But bad weather is forecast and a draw looks the sensible option at 6-4 with Stanley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
