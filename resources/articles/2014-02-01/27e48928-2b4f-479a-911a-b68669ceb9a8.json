It shimmers in the distance, and seems closer as parliaments are elected, governments set up, and meetings held, but somehow the country never gets there. So it is no wonder that the men and women voting on Thursday for a 60-member assembly which will draft a constitution were, according to many reports, in a less than enthusiastic mood. The constitution is supposed to provide a solid foundation for the country's future by laying out the rights and duties of citizens, protecting minorities, defining the legal system and deciding on the form of government. But the problem is that each institutional innovation since 2011 has been accompanied by hopes that it would lead to a normal and, above all, a truly national political life, and none have made much difference. The hard truth is that power in Libya has been captured by armed militias, who control much of what goes on in each region. Some are tribal or local. Others are the armed wings of political parties which did not do well in elections but insist, at the point of a gun, in having their say in all decisions. They do not govern or administer in any full sense of the word. That is work for which they have neither the inclination nor the capacity, expecting the task of keeping the streetlights on and the water running to be done by others, but reserving the right to intervene in an arbitrary or predatory way whenever they wish to do so. The militias have blocked the export of oil, kidnapped politicians and officials, including the prime minister, and burst into meetings to demand that the vote on an issue goes the way they want it to go. Two of the biggest have recently demanded that parliament be dissolved, putting them on a collision course with other armed groups which back Prime Minister Ali Zeidan's government. The army is too small, and also perhaps too divided, to be an effective counterweight. Ominous developments of this kind have been complemented by comic opera episodes like the one a few days ago when a retired general declared that a military coup was under way and spoke grandly of a \"road map\" for Libya which he would soon put into effect. Nothing at all then happened, and the affair remains mysterious. But Libyans would be too sanguine if they were to expect it always to be the case that the many threats to their fragile state will just fizzle out. The vacuum in Libya has allowed Islamist groups, notably Ansar al-Sharia, to establish themselves, and that in turn has brought American and Nato attention and surveillance. It will take more than a new constitution to overcome this dangerous legacy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
