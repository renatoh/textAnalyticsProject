Further down their descent, Yates was forced to abandon Simpson on the mountainside. Simpson\u2019s book about his improbable survival, Touching the Void, has sold more than 1m copies and in 2003 became a Bafta-winning film. (In the process, Simpson became a hero and Yates an arch villain \u2013 both of which notions Simpson strongly rejects.) Now the events have also inspired a play, which opened at the Bristol Old Vic last year and this month transfers to London\u2019s West End. Simpson, 59, lives in the Peak District, and is the author of eight books. What\u2019s been your involvement in Touching the Void, the play? Well, my first reaction was: \u201cGood luck! How the hell are you going to stage that?\u201d Then [writer] David Greig and [director] Tom Morris came up to see me and I made it clear that I didn\u2019t want any involvement in the writing or the creation of the work. So if it succeeded, it was their success, and if it failed, it was their failure. A coward\u2019s way out! Then I sat back and watched these five-star reviews coming in and thought: \u201cBloody hell, here we go again\u2026\u201d It\u2019s strange. In fact, it\u2019s more than a bit strange. What next? A bloody musical? Are you able to judge it as a piece of entertainment? In short, no. I\u2019m really the worst person to ask for an opinion of a version of Touching the Void. But the play tries, I think, to delve deeper into the nature of mountaineering and individuals putting their life at risk for something they love, and possibly paying a heavy price. Why does this story, 35 years on, continue to captivate people? I was reading somewhere there\u2019s a notion that\u2019s very embedded in our cultural history called the myth of the returning warrior. It\u2019s in the sagas of Beowulf, everything from Robert the Bruce, even Jesus Christ: of somebody going away to a very dark, scary place, often death or into Hades, and coming back. Of course, I might just be talking out my arse, because I\u2019ve been asked this question so many times, but I\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s more than just an adventure story. Did you see Free Solo, the Oscar-winning documentary film about Alex Honnold\u2019s attempt to climb El Capitan in Yosemite without ropes? Holy shit, I couldn\u2019t watch it! I did, but crikey, that just scared the crap out of me. Honnold tells his girlfriend he has no obligation to stay safe for her. Did you recognise that single-mindedness? Yeah, to a degree. Alex Honnold is an exception on various levels, but I was always struck by how selfish serious mountaineering is: you might love it, you might get killed and you have accepted that risk, but it\u2019s your loved ones that pay. To do something like that, you have to be a little bit unhinged. That\u2019s not an insult. I think all top sportsmen are mad as a bag of ferrets, frankly; they are doing things to an obsessional level that many people would regard as quite unhealthy. You went back to climbing after your accident, and only stopped in 2009. What\u2019s taken its place? Nothing. Nothing ever will. I actually surprised myself, I sat up on this peak in Nepal in 2009 and I could see however many 8,000-metre peaks: Everest, Lhotse. It was a gorgeous day. I knew I had a three-and-a-half-day descent and it was going to be murderous on my knee. So I thought: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much better than this. This is the time to stop.\u201d And I just went to Kathmandu and sold all my gear, and I never climbed again. But it was like grief in a way, and it\u2019s because it\u2019s something you spent your entire life doing. It\u2019s what you live for and then suddenly it\u2019s not there. What\u2019s recreation now for you? I\u2019ve done various things like paragliding and they\u2019re fun, but they haven\u2019t come near replacing climbing. So I took up cabinet making. And, in fact, this morning, I was just teaching myself to weld. To weld? To weld. I just like learning new skills, I think. I absolutely adore working with wood. And I\u2019ve realised I\u2019m an absolutely crap cabinet maker. On Desert Island Discs in 2004, you said you never expected to find a life partner, but you\u2019ve since got married to Corrinne. Did you surprise yourself? Yeah, I bloody did! But it\u2019s not a coincidence that it was after I stopped mountaineering. While I climbed, I was too selfish. But it just proves how completely wrong you can be all the time. Which is rather wonderful. You\u2019ve described what happened to you in the Andes as a privilege but also a regret. How do you look back on it now? With some degree of amazement, actually. You think you\u2019ve got some plan for your life and that\u2019s the first thing that goes out the window, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s that famous Mike Tyson saying: you have a plan until someone punches you in the face. On one level, if I hadn\u2019t had that experience in Peru, I would never have become a writer, which I love. I wouldn\u2019t have become successful and I would not have the comfortable life I now have. So it\u2019s a bit ripe to start moaning about it. But on another level, there is a regret that I never really did find out what I could do from a mountaineering point of view. I sometimes wonder, \u201cwhat if\u2026?\u201d But, actually, the most likely \u201cwhat if\u201d is that I\u2019d be dead. \u2022 Touching the Void is at the Duke of York\u2019s theatre, London, from 9 November to 29 February 2020.
