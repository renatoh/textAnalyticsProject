The Kiwis are ranked the world's No1 team and have not lost to Martin Johnson's side since 2003, winning the past eight encounters. Yet Smith, the former Northampton coach, is refusing to underestimate the home side ahead of the clash at Twickenham. \"Every time you play England, Scotland, Wales or Ireland you have to be up for the physical contest,\" he said, barely 24 hours after stepping off the plane from Hong Kong, where New Zealand lost in a thriller to Australia on Saturday. \"There's no hiding from that. If we're not up to engaging them physically we're going to get hammered.\" Not that it stops at the physical hammering, apparently. Those boys in white can play a bit, too. \"They will be more expansive [than usual] because of the laws, and they've got some players like [Chris] Ashton and [Ben] Foden who like to counterattack and are good at it. They showed in Australia that they can compete with southern-hemisphere teams \u2013 and that was away from home. We're in their backyard and coming off not a very good performance. It's going to be a real challenge for us.\" A closer examination of Smith's state of mind revealed more in the way of acute pain at the loss on Saturday and a burning hunger to set things right straightaway \u2013 which means against those physical, counter-attacking Englishmen. The All Blacks had set their sights on the record their 1969 predecessors shared with the 1998 Springboks of 17 consecutive Test wins \u2013 although that record was actually surpassed by Lithuania in April this year, when they beat Serbia and Montenegro to record their 18th in a row. Either way, the All Blacks had hoped they might surpass them all by completing a clean sweep on this end-of-year tour. Alas, Australia's win has ended the All Blacks' run on 15. \"You hope you're going to be special,\" said Smith when asked to reflect on the defeat. \"I'm sure we were all hoping we'd be something special and beat that record. But we proved on Saturday that if we don't get it spot on we're like everyone else. You get to the point where maybe the intensity that got you there isn't quite what it should be. Pat Riley [the American basketball coach] calls it the disease of me. I guess that's why the record is 17.\" It will be fascinating enough just to see how the All Blacks respond at Twickenham on Saturday. But yet more intrigue will centre around what is likely to be a first appearance in black from Sonny Bill Williams. He was one of two players put up before the media today, which, loosely translated, means he will almost certainly be involved on Saturday, probably from the bench. The celebrated convert from rugby league is on his first All Blacks tour, but is being talked about even more than the Dan Carters and Richie McCaws. \"It's tough,\" he said, \"but I've just got to learn. I don't put myself in the media. I just try to keep it simple. I'm the new boy on the block here, and I've got no runs on the board. I'm just trying to do my best.\" An immaculate start, then, from the All Blacks on their tour of the British Isles. If only they played as modestly as they talk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
