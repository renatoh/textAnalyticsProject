Former Scotland striker Mark Burchill fired Dunfermline ahead on the stroke of half-time with a fierce low drive from inside the area and his strike partner Noel Hunt doubled the advantage 13 minutes into the second half with a looping header. Darryl Duffy gave the home team hope with a goal in the 68th minute, but despite intense late pressure, it was to prove only a consolation. A dramatic late winner for Motherwell by Kevin McBride sent Livingston back to the foot of the table. Motherwell midfielder Ritchie Foran opened the scoring when he capitalised on a slack pass by Richard Brittain on the half-hour mark, but seven minutes later, the Livingston midfielder atoned for his error when his cross was headed home by Harald Pinxten. However, a tremendous drive by McBride from the edge of the penalty area with seconds remaining gave the visiting team the points. Inverness extended their unbeaten sequence in the league to nine matches after a spirited display held Aberdeen to their third goalless draw in their past four matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
