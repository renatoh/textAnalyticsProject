The 34-year-old smooth-striding Kenyan ran 2hr 4min 55sec through the streets of the German capital to take 43 seconds off the mark set by America's Khalid Khannouchi in London last year. The usually modest Tergat celebrated wildly as he crossed the line ahead of 35,000 runners under the pillars of the Brandenburg Gate, waving his arms and hugging his wife. The record is validation of Tergat's greatness. He had won five consecutive world cross-country titles, set a world record in the 10,000 metres and finished second in the Olympics twice, thwarted only by the brilliance of Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie. When he turned his talents to the marathon two years ago, most experts thought it was inevitable he would one day break the world record, especially as he was already the fastest half-marathon runner in history with a time of 59.17. But in his first five marathons, although he had run fast, averaging a phenomenal 2:07.27, he had not won. He finished second to Khannouchi when the American ran his record race of 2:05.38 in London, coming in 10 seconds behind. There were moments in the final stages yesterday when Tergat feared history was about to repeat. Sammy Korir, the pacemaker, made a late charge at his compatriot after falling back over the final mile. The two had matched each other stride for stride through much of the race on Berlin's pancake-flat course before Tergat edged ahead. Korir finished only a second behind to take second on the all-time list. \"At last,\" said Tergat. \"I have been training to have this result for a long time. I'm very happy to be able to get it. I knew that we were headed toward a great time and made sure the pace didn't get too fast. That paid off at the finish.\" Tergat ran the first half in 63.01 - as he had planned - before picking up the pace in the second half with consistent times of about 2min 55sec9 per kilometre. Surprisingly, considering Kenya's dominance of distance running, Tergat is the first Kenyan man to hold the world record for the marathon and only the third African, following the Ethiopians Abebe Bikila and Belayneh Dinsamo, although Khannouchi was born in Morocco. It was the fifth world best to be set in this race and the fourth in five years. Tergat had turned down a much better financial offer from organisers of the Chicago Marathon to run here. \"I never put money ahead of achievement,\" he said. \"My passion is the sport.\" Yasuko Hashimoto won the women's race in 2:26.32, the fourth consecutive time a Japanese runner has won the race. Liz Yelling, a Bedford clubmate of the world record holder Paula Radcliffe, finished eighth in 2:30.58 on her debut at the distance. That is more than a minute inside the Olympic qualifying time and should book her a place in Britain's team for Athens next year. Radcliffe, who followed the race via the internet from her home in Loughborough, rang her former training partner to congratulate her on the achievement. \"She was really delighted and actually rang me a second time to tell me again how chuffed she was,\" said Yelling. She had sought advice from Radcliffe before the race, although she still suffered stomach problems that necessitated two toilet stops. \"I saw a public toilet and rushed in and later in the race I had to go again,\" she said. \"I'll just have to look at my diet again. I probably had too many power bars and carbohydrates on Saturday. \"It hasn't quite sunk in yet and, although I was comfortable throughout the race, I'm now feeling a bit knackered. \"But I came here and achieved what I had aimed for. Once I've settled down, I'll probably sit down and have a little cry.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
