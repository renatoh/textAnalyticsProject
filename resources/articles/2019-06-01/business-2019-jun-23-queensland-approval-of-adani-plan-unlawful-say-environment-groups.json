Environmental groups are now considering a legal challenge to the approval, partly because the state\u2019s Department of Environment and Science (DES) appeared to negotiate a last-minute compromise with Adani rather than applying strict conditions. The DES insisted on Friday that it had not changed its position when granting approval for Adani\u2019s groundwater dependent ecosystems management plan \u2013 the final hurdle that will allow the company to begin construction of the Carmichael coalmine. But documents obtained by Guardian Australia, and an email sent by a DES spokesman on 9 April, indicate that the department softened its interpretation of a key requirement in the politically charged weeks before clearing the proposal. The email of 9 April says the department believed the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia had highlighted \u201cuncertainties\u201d about whether Adani had identified the source aquifer of the Doongmabulla Springs complex. \u201cBased on the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia report, it would appear that a number of uncertainties remain, including whether the (groundwater plan) definitively identifies the source aquifers of the Doongmabulla Springs Complex, which has always been a requirement for state approval,\u201d the email says. Four days after the federal election, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, insisted on a timeframe for DES to make a decision about the groundwater plan. When the clock ran out on 13 June, Adani\u2019s plan was approved, and DES had subtly changed its language. It said Adani had \u201csufficiently\u201d identified the \u201cmain source aquifer\u201d. The miner\u2019s conditions require it to identify the \u201csource aquifer(s)\u201d. DES said its decision to approve the management plan was made after it received legal advice. It also took into account additional advice from the federal science agencies, received on 7 June, which said that \u201csome level of uncertainty\u201d would always exist with conceptual groundwater models. As part of the approved plan, Adani has committed to future work to \u201cimprove the understanding of source aquifers\u201d. But environmental groups say the condition required Adani to identify the source of the springs before any groundwater plan could be approved; and that the process was designed to safeguard the springs from potential damage caused by the drawdown of groundwater during construction or mining operations. On 11 June, two days before the approval was announced, Lock the Gate wrote to DES saying it would be \u201cunlawful\u201d to approve of Adani\u2019s groundwater plan because expert advice clearly outlined that the source aquifers had not been established. \u201cBy pressuring [DES] into approving the water plan without doing the required research and identifying beyond doubt the source aquifer for the Doongmabulla Springs Complex, Adani and the Queensland Government have found themselves in legally questionable territory,\u201d Lock the Gate campaign coordinator Carmel Flint said. The Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s Stop Adani campaigner Christian Slattery said the group was considering the decision and examining legal avenues available. \u201c(The process) seems to show how politics has completely trumped science and the Queensland government has sold out the long-term interests of regional communities, traditional owners, and the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe watering down of that interpretation of that environmental authority condition is a clear demonstration of how the government is afraid to stand up to big mining corporations.\u201d Slattery said the groundwater plan deferred critical scientific research until after mining would commence and \u201cwhen irreversible impacts may already have occurred\u201d. A DES spokesman said the department\u2019s assessment of Adani\u2019s various plans had \u201calways been rigorous and based on the best available science\u201d. \u201cAs the independent regulator, the department made its own decision after receiving Adani\u2019s final version of the (groundwater plan) on 12 June, which addressed previous feedback the department had given. \u201cThe department and Adani met regularly \u2026 to ensure the plan was robust and provided the maximum environmental protection.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
