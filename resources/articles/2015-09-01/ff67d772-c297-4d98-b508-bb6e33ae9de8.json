Public Health England, which released the results on Wednesday of screening that took place over the summer term at Teign school, an 11-18 academy in Kingsteignton near Newton Abbot, said the majority of transmissions occurred during the 2013/14 school year. Many of those who tested positive are receiving treatment for latent TB infection to prevent the development of the disease in the future. Health authorities stressed they do not have the disease and are not infectious. Dr Sarah Harrison, deputy director of health protection for Public Health England South-West, said: \u201cThe situation is under control and the risk of further infection within the school is now no greater than that in the general public.\u201d She said that the year groups primarily affected were those of two students with infectious TB, adding: \u201cOf those screened as school contacts, fewer than 10 people are being treated for active TB. These were all diagnosed in the early stages of disease. There have been no further infectious cases at the school. \u201cConsequently, we do not anticipate the need for any further screening at the school and it can continue to operate as normal.\u201d Mark Woodlock, headteacher of Teign school, added: \u201cAs a school, we are greatly relieved that this process is drawing to a close and that there is unlikely to be a need for further testing of students. \u201cIt has been a very difficult time for many individuals \u2013 students, teachers and their families. They have had to cope with the demands of a positive test, whilst continuing to try live as normal a life as possible. For many, that involved taking examinations and it is testament to their strength that their results have been so strong. \u201cThe school is very grateful to Public Health England for the time they have devoted to working with the school. We are also grateful to the wider community for their continued support. For those still undergoing treatment of some description, they continue to have our best wishes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
