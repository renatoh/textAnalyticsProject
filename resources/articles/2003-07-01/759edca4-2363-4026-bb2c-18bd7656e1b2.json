Imagine, too, that some weeks earlier, to give added spice, his Defence Secretary had said that he wanted to reform the command structures in the British armed forces so they slotted better into the command structures of the fledgling European rapid reaction force. There would have been bedlam. You can see the front pages of the tabloids and the editorials in the Right-of-centre broadsheets. Yet, as Mr Blair did just this in Washington, running up the white flag over any attempt to sustain a defence infrastructure independent from the US and making a mockery of possible plans for Britain to participate in European collective security arrangements, there has scarcely been a peep. The lack of debate, however, does not correspond to the importance of the moment. We are to become a satrapy of the Pentagon, with all that implies. BAE's industrial dilemma as Britain's largest manufacturer and biggest defence contractor employing 100,000 people - how to control the widening gap between the US defence industry and Europe's as the Americans dramatically tighten their willingness to allow any form of technological transfer - is forcing an answer to the strategic question of whether Britain defines itself as European or American. Until now, successive Prime Ministers have been able to avoid the choice. They have had access to high-level American technology such as the Trident and the Tomahawk missile systems as well as collaborating on European defence projects such as the Eurofighter. The US indulged us, regarding the risks of technological leakage as minimal; BAE could, thus, be a big player on both sides of the Atlantic. Not any more. The Bush administration was determined on the unilateralist militarisation of American foreign policy even before 11 September and, intent on widening US defence leadership, clamped down on even the slightest risk of its technological leadership being accessed by others, even the loyal British. Thus, when BAE became a subcontractor to build the new American jet-fighter, the F-35, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in 2001, the Government had to accept that it would not have automatic access to the key codes allowing us to adjust the plane's weapons systems to changing future threats. We are to put \u00a32 billion up to share the development costs of the aircraft, but can only adapt its use if the US agrees. The rules on the Trident and Tomahawk were tough, but the rules on the F-35 are even tougher. The Pentagon and the conservatives on the key Congressional committees want to go further. BAE faces the prospect of getting work from the Americans that cast it as a technological pygmy. Unless it can become a trusted contractor in its own right to the Pentagon, it believes it might as well throw in the towel. European defence spending is growing at a fraction of the rate from a lower base. If BAE wants to secure its future, it believes it must merge with one of the American companies, as Mike Turner, BAE's chief executive, openly argues and, he hopes, as an equal partner. Fat chance. Boeing, touted as the most likely partner and with whom BAE has had talks about talks, is four times its size. It would be swallowed up whole. BAE's investment, research and employment policies would be dictated from Boeing's new HQ in Chicago, but only after close consultation with the Pentagon. Contracts and development work from Europe would dry up. Britain's armed forces would operate largely with American kit. And, as Geoff Hoon has signalled, their command structures would be adapted to permit American battlefield direction and control. The argument is that as America's and Britain's foreign and security ambitions are identical, and that as there is little prospect of being in any significant conflict where the Americans are not fighting as well, we should have compatible military equipment and command structures. We should simply ride the technological coat-tails of the US, accept its draconian rules for technological transfer and cede 100,000 British jobs and defence capability to whichever American company is prepared to buy BAE. Doubtless, if the terms are right, members of the BAE board will make a small fortune through their share options. Blair, Hoon and Straw are signed up to the cause. This, I think, is the gravest betrayal of our national interest. The argument turns on two false premises. British and American interests are not always and everywhere identical, as should be obvious after Iraq, where we are committed to a long-term, expensive and potentially murderous engagement for precious little gain and without UN support. The object of American foreign and defence policy is to sustain US hegemony. The object of British foreign policy is to sustain multilateralism and the rule of international law; where we don't, we risk another Iraq. As a result, we are highly likely to want to commit to military interventions to enforce either UN or EU will, and to have to do so without the US or, even occasionally, in the teeth of its hostility. To wreck our capacity to act in this way because our weapon systems are all masterminded by US codes and built by US contractors is the height of folly. It is also a kick in the teeth for any hopes of developing a distinctive EU defence and security capacity of which Britain is part - and with whose interests Britain is more closely aligned. The EU needs to develop the military capacity to intervene in today's short wars and the difficult job of peacekeeping, a very different and complementary capacity to the US. The air, naval and ground requirements are distinctive and need to be supported by an appropriately customised defence manufacturing infrastructure. To become part of the US defence complex serving very different needs is lunacy, even if it enriches BAE directors and gives a short-term fix to redressing the company's technological weakness. You would have thought that pro-European Mr Blair would see these arguments - and first-term Blair certainly did. Half-way through his second term, he seems to have lost his bearings. Curiously, entering the euro is more reversible than abandoning our capacity for autonomous military action to deliver our security and our interests. We may want access to American technology, but let's not sacrifice our integrity as a country to gain it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
