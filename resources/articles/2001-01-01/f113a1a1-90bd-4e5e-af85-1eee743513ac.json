How Lee, the latest to make the return journey through the revolving managerial door that comes as standard at Molineux, could have done with the benevolence dispensed by the Stockport midfielder Jarkko Wiss when he expertly sidefooted an own goal to put the hosts 2-0 ahead. Similar good fortune, which was conspicuously absent earlier in the season, could have helped Lee keep his job. Likewise Taylor, if the Wolves board had shown the patience to allow him to benefit from the youth scheme he set up five years ago. The product of Taylor's foresight, honed and nurtured by the coach Terry Connor, Lee and his assistant John Ward, was evident as County were swept aside. Adam Proudlock and Lee Naylor, the respective scorer and architect of the Wolves opener, Keith Andrews and Joleon Lescott have all risen through the ranks and all had fine games. So did the scorer of the decisive third goal, Michael Branch, a youngster brought up at Everton but whose potential was spotted by Lee. Patience, though, is an unfashionable virtue in modern-day football, especially at Wolves. After the all-conquering days of the late 1950s and early 60s plus some high-profile sorties into Europe a decade later, supporters see a place in the Premiership as the club's right and their 15-year exclusion from it rankles. No one remembers the glory days more clearly than the club's benefactor and chairman Sir Jack Hayward. Now in his mid-70s, the multi-millionaire is understandably in more of a hurry than most to restore them. The worry is that if Wolves opt for a quick fix and hire the promotion specialist Dave Bassett then, unless Sir Jack once again dips into his millions, promising youngsters will have to be sold to raise the cash to bring in the experienced players he would need. It is a scenario the caretaker manager Ward fears but, whichever route is taken, he is adamant the club should make their intentions clear. \"Whatever happens now I think the club should set out and decide the policy and strategy for what's going to happen over what might be the next four or five years,\" he said. \"If they want to go with young players then that graph line is not going to go straight up. There will be blips and people will have to be patient, positive and consistent. If there is money to spend then it could be different. But I think that policy needs to be defined by the people who run the club. That would settle the whole club down.\" Bassett, the favourite to succeed Lee, has already been spoken to by the Wolves board and declared his interest in the job. So too has Ward after being invited to apply by the managing director Jez Moxey before Saturday's kick-off. What followed will not have done his prospects any harm: an adventurous 4-3-3 formation that saw George Ndah and Branch as wingers-cum-strikers, and Proudlock, down the middle, proving too hot for County. So Shane Nicholson's penalty and a late Wiss header were minor inconveniences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
