In 2010 his acclaimed album Countryman gave us the heartbreaking, confessional She Cried. A single, simple acoustic guitar line becomes the delicate thread running through Yamma\u2019s raw and plaintive vocals, full of yearning, with sections of naturally delivered spoken word. In his fifth studio album Uncle, released in October, he experiments with fuller sounds, without ever losing his trademark emotional honesty. Sydneysiders can catch Yamma with the hip-hop artist Radical Son (here\u2019s his video for Human Behaviour if you\u2019re after a taster with a touch of reggae) at the Newtown Social Club on Thursday, with both artists launching their albums. Vacant Space \u2013 George Maple Sydney\u2019s George Maple, aka Jessica Higgs, makes dance music that steers clear of cheap thrills. Songs like Fixed and Talk Talk (the latter of which has racked up more than 2m listens on Soundcloud) walk that fine line dividing the moody, experimental spectrum of electronica from the more radio-friendly electro-pop hits. Fans of her label mates Flume and Chet Faker, on Future Classic, will appreciate Maple\u2019s introspective dancefloor fodder, with the new EP Vacant Space a good place to start for those yet to be acquainted with her whispery vocals and futuristic production. The title track has been burning up Hype Machine and iTunes charts, and this year she landed herself on the radio DJ Zane Lowe\u2019s Next Hype list. I Wish I Was Him \u2013 Noise Addict In honour of the Lemonheads\u2019 return to Australian shores this week, we\u2019re revisiting this tribute to frontman Evan Dando, penned by a pubescent Ben Lee and his first band, Noise Addict. It was the early 90s, the Lemonheads were at the height of their powers (Mrs Robinson and It\u2019s a Shame About Ray were clogging the airwaves), Dando was the grunge heart-throb du jour, and Lee and his young bandmates from Bondi were in thrall. \u201cI wish I was him/ He gets the girls at his feet/ With all his cool friends/ He gets his records for free,\u201d squeaked a starstruck Lee. The track changed everything for Noise Addict, catching the attention of the Beastie Boys, who signed the band to Grand Royal Records. As the years rolled by, the tables turned for devotee and idol: Lee dated Claire Danes, married Ione Skye and had a successful solo career, while Dando developed a drug habit no one would wish for. In 2003 Lee paid the ultimate tribute to his idol, writing two songs \u2013 Hard Drive and All My Life \u2013 for Dando\u2019s solo album Baby I\u2019m Bored. In the Lemonheads\u2019 live sets, Dando sometimes returns the favour \u2013 by covering I Wish I Was Him. I\u2019m a Fantastic Wreck \u2013 Montaigne There are some \u2013 dare we say many \u2013 artists who bob in the rivers of modern music and, in drinking from the same waters as others, produce work that is rigorously on trend. But those like 19-year-old singer Montaigne (real name Jessica Cerro) from Sydney have a musical identity too distinct to allow them to blend into the crowds. In I\u2019m a Frantastic Wreck there is a Kate Bush-ness about the dramatic delivery, with a surprising forcefulness and a clean, pop finish. But see her cover of Sia\u2019s Chandelier to witness how she radically changes the feel of that song with her unusual delivery. Cerro was a Triple J Unearthed High finalist in 2012, and since then has finished her HSC, studied songwriting under Michael Szumowski of Alberts music and released her first EP, Life Of Montaigne. Amexica \u2013 Trujillo With immigration from its Hispanic neighbours likely to be a crucial US election issue in 2016, this hymn to the Americas\u2019 Latino heritage is timely, providing as it does a kind of sonic briefing dossier for the whole debate. Freddy Trujillo was born into a musical family in east LA but has forged a career in Americana\u2019s broad hinterlands, most recently with the sublime Delines. On this new record he takes inspiration from musical heroes such as Doug Sahm and Los Lobos. Mas Macho que Macho sets the tone with its classic Tejano feel, while Assimilation Blues moves that sound into the present day and the beautiful, flowing Freddy Fender pays tribute to the late-Tejano star. It\u2019s great stuff and although some of the lyrical phrasing jars a bit, this is not only a topical record but a very cool one too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
