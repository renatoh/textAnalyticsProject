According to documents published in the San Francisco Chronicle, the American told the grand jury investigating drug use in sport last year that Victor Conte, the founder and owner of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, gave weekly doses of HGH and a substance known as \"the clear\". That turned out to be tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), the designer steroid for which Britain's Dwain Chambers tested positive. Montgomery was formally charged with committing a doping offence by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on Wednesday night, along with fellow American sprinters Michelle Collins, Chryste Gaines and Alvin Harrison. Marion Jones, the triple Olympic champion and Montgomery's partner, who has also been under investigation, was not charged. She has always denied taking drugs but Montgomery's testimony appears to contradict her claims that she had little to do with Conte. The United States Anti-Doping Agency filed the charges based on documentary evidence recovered during the FBI investigation into Balco and Montgomery's testimony. The documents did not form part of USADA's case, which they already believed compelling enough to call for Montgomery to be banned for life and for his performances since February 2000 to be annulled. On November 6 last year Montgomery told the grand jury that he knew HGH was a banned substance and that he was taking \"the clear\", which Conte told him was a steroid-like substance that was not banned. \"This was the magic potion,\" Montgomery told the grand jury. Montgomery said he learned of Conte through Harrison, who had told him Conte provided nutritional supplements. Montgomery testified that it was his understanding Conte could not help Jones unless he received approval from her 100m rival Gaines, also alleged to be a Conte client. \"So Chryste, from my understanding, had told Mr Conte that: 'Whatever you charge her, if you give me a cut of it, then I don't mind',\" said Montgomery. \"So, I don't know how much the cheque was for, I don't know if she ever got her cut, but that's how the agreement came for him to work with Marion.\" When Montgomery met Conte at the Sydney Olympics he claims Conte told him: \"Watch what Alvin is going to do in the 400. And watch what Marion is going to do . . . You will see how powerful it is.\" Jones won three gold medals at the games. Harrison won silver in the 400m and gold in the 4x400m relay. Two months after the Olympics, Montgomery alleged Conte convened a meeting to begin \"Project World Record\". Steroids were never discussed but soon after Conte began giving Montgomery \"the clear\" - a liquid administered with a syringe by placing drops under the tongue. He also took HGH, a powerful undetectable substance, of which Conte sent him four vials a month. Montgomery said his relationship with Conte ended in September 2001, a year before he broke the world 100m record. He claimed he was not taking steroids at the time. Montgomery's lawyer Cristina Arguedas refused to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
