I have enjoyed Mr Halpin's work since I started to travel to London extensively and would see \"TOX 06\" emblazoned on mile after mile of train carriages, railway sidings, bridges and buildings. Its ubiquity, regularity and apparent pointlessness is what makes the work a powerful critique of the monotony and triviality of the many signs and notices put up by the state which bear instructions, prohibitions and statements of the obvious. When I walk down a street and see in the space of half a mile 20 metal plaques bearing all manner of petty injunctions \u2013 \"No drinking in this area\"; \"No parking on matchdays 6.30pm\u20138.30pm\"; \"Dogs to be kept on leads in the park\" \u2013 I feel, to borrow vocabulary from Detective Constable Livings, the state has committed a selfish vandalism which scars the environment and contributes to a sense of oppression, anxiety and lack of personal agency. As artist Ben Flynn says, Mr Halpin's work is indeed \"incredibly basic\" and lacking in \"style\". I think that's the point.
