The Worcester prop, who qualified for Wales by residency last month, will appear before an Rugby Football Union disciplinary committee in Bristol on Tuesday charged with stamping in the win over Leeds last week. If found guilty, he faces a ban of one to three months, which would rule him out of Wales's four internationals next month. Meanwhile, Mike Ruddock has arranged a meeting with his centre Gavin Henson. The Wales coach is reported to be concerned about the impact of some passages of Henson's book on the national squad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
