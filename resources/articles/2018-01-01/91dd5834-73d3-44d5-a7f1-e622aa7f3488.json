The shadow human services minister, and first Indigenous woman elected to the federal lower house, said on Wednesday that the Greens were turning Australia Day \u201cinto a political issue\u201d and called for a renewed focus on the Uluru statement for constitutional recognition and a voice to parliament. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, started 2018 by campaigning to move Australia Day from 26 January, which has prompted accusations from the Turnbull government that the party is attacking national unity. But Burney \u2013 who told Radio National that 26 January was \u201cextremely painful\u201d to first Australians \u2013 is an unlikely critic of the Greens campaign because she is sympathetic to the idea of moving the date. Asked about Labor\u2019s position, Burney said there was \u201cno proposal to change the date\u201d and it won\u2019t change \u201cany time soon\u201d. But the opposition wanted Australians to \u201cthink deeply about the truth and true history of this country and [have] it be a day of reflection\u201d, she said. Burney said 26 January was not a day of celebration for first peoples, and represented the usurping of Aboriginal culture and \u201cthe attack on sovereignty\u201d. \u201cThe Labor position is very clear and it is broader than just whether we\u2019re going to change the date \u2026 that\u2019s a very narrow way to look at the issue of Indigenous affairs. \u201cWhatever happened to the Uluru statement that Malcolm Turnbull cut down, that has to be part of the discussion as well.\u201d Burney said issues of health, education, incarceration and employment were \u201cat the top of the agenda for changing the life chances of Indigenous Australians\u201d. Burney said she had difficulty celebrating Australia Day, and while she attended official functions she noted they now included elements of official Aboriginal history and culture. She also attends the Survival festival in Sydney. The shadow human services minister said she was worried by \u201cthe jingoism that\u2019s coming into Australia Day\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes you any more Australian if you wrap a flag around you and tattoo the Southern Cross on your neck.\u201d Burney noted that 26 January did not officially become the Australia Day public holiday until 1994 and said within Labor she was advocating for a national public holiday to recognise first Australians. The assistant immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has said he has not heard a \u201creasonable argument\u201d to support changing the date of Australia Day. Hawke said the national day should not be moved \u201cjust because we have some elements of our history that we\u2019re not proud of\u201d. On Wednesday the trade minister, Steven Ciobo, told ABC\u2019s AM that the push to change the date was \u201can attempt to delegitimise the significance and cultural impact of Australia Day\u201d. Ciobo said that Australia Day should not \u201cbe an excuse to mourn what has happened, that it should downplay or delegitimise \u2026 valid community expectations that Australia Day is a day for celebration\u201d. He said the day \u201cisn\u2019t about commemorating or celebrating white oppression \u2026 it\u2019s about what Australia is today, it\u2019s a celebration of the values we share as people\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
