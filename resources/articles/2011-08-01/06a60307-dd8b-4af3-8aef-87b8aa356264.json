As limitless as the human imagination. Gazing at the stars and the planets has inspired all sorts of flights of fancy. Hell, entire religions and belief systems have been based on staring into space. Musicians, too, have been captivated by the movements of the heavens \u2013 and of course by human explorations of space, such as the Apollo moon landings. What are your favourite songs about space? I'll gather the best of them in a blog posted here next Thursday. The toolbox: * Listen to others' suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist * Guide to \"donds\", \"zedded\", and other strange words used by some of the RR regulars (courtesy of the Marconium) * The Marconium (blog containing a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \"zedded\") * The 'Spill (blog for the RR community) Please do: * Post your nominations before midday on Tuesday if you wish them to be considered. * Write a few lines advocating the merits of your choices. But please don't: * Post more than one third of the lyrics of any song. * Dump lists of nominations. If you must post more than two or three at once, please attempt to justify your choices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
