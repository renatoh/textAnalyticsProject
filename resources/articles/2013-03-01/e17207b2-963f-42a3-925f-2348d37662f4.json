Also escaped with a handball against Higuain. 7 Rio Ferdinand Something of a risk to play both of United's elder centre-halves but his composure was impressive until the extra man told. 7 Nemanja Vidic Unlucky not to open the scoring with a first-half header against a post. Over-stretched once United were reduced to 10 men. 6 Patrice Evra Scant protection from Nani and unable to venture forward so often. Took a booking after a poor Nani corner. Defended well. 6 Michael Carrick Crucial in nullifying Ronaldo and Ozil for 59 minutes but when Modric joined Kak\u00e1 in midfield, was overrun as Real turned the tie. 7 Tom Cleverley Snapped into every challenge for almost an hour but was ultimately swamped by Real's numerical advantage. 7 Ryan Giggs Rolled back the years. First touch, vision and tackling shone with 10 team-mates. Unable to impose himself as much alongside nine. 8 Danny Welbeck Directness, pace and awareness troubled Real, subduing Alonso, but the finishing does not complement the rest of his game. 8 Nani Did not justify his surprise inclusion. Only moved from the margins of the game when he fell victim to a harsh red card that changed the course of the tie. 4 Robin van Persie A few attacks were disrupted by his awkward first touch and could not take the half chances that fell his way. 6 Substitutes Wayne Rooney (Cleverley, 73); Had one chance to set up a great finale but blazed over. Ashley Young (Welbeck, 80); Antonio Valencia (R Da Silva, 87). Real Madrid Diego L\u00f3pez Crucial in denying United a remarkable recovery. Vital saves plus some time-wasting, killed United's hope. 8 Alvaro Arbeloa Offers no support in the final third but his job is to prevent anyone getting in behind. Booked for late foul on Evra. 7 Rapha\u00ebl Varane Impressive for 19 but struggled against Vidic, tried over-ambitious passes and lost out to Nani ahead of Ramos' own goal. 6 Sergio Ramos Unlucky to divert Welbeck's shot past own keeper but otherwise superb in reading the threat from United. 8 F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o Involved in an engrossing tussle with Giggs. Tucked in alongside Ramos to stifle United in the second half. 7 Sami Khedira Strong presence in midfield although it took arrival of Kak\u00e1 and Modric for him to gain an advantage over Carrick and Cleverley. 6 Xabi Alonso Picked out as \"the controller\" of Real by Ferguson and detailed by a mix of Welbeck, Giggs and Cleverley as a result. 7 Angel Di Mar\u00eda United offered no room for Real to hurt them on the counter-attack and the Argentine duly suffered. 5 Mesut Ozil Tireless in and around the United defence, his midfield runs posed a genuine threat, and helped create the all-important second. 8 Cristiano Ronaldo Moved by the reception and repaid them with the goal that knocked United out of Europe. Handled well until Nani's red. 8 Gonzalo Higua\u00edn Forced to drop deep but never stopped and earned his reward with the cross-shot that produced Ronaldo's winner. 7 Substitutes Kak\u00e1 (Di Mar\u00eda, h-t) Came on to strengthen central midfield and linked up well with his fellow substitute, Modric Luca Modric (Arbeloa, 59) Key to the Real recovery with a stunning finish and a part in the second goal. Pepe (Ozil, 71)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
