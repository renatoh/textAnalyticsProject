The Press Freedom House will provide persecuted journalists with accommodation, training opportunities, medical and psychological support and help to rebuild their careers. The campaign is being spearheaded by the Exiled Journalists' Network (EJN), an organisation run by and for media workers who have been forced to flee their home countries because of persecution. The Daily Mail, Financial Times, Guardian, Reporters sans Fronti\u00e8res (RSF), Reuters Foundation and the Society of Editors are all supporting the plan. The idea comes from Paris, where a safe house opened in May 2002, offering protection to up to 30 journalists every year. Housed in a three-storey hostel with 15 bedrooms, a communal kitchen and social and study areas, La Maison des Journalistes provides accommodation and support for up to six months. It was set up by Dani\u00e8le Ohayona, a journalist with France Info, and film producer Philippe Spinau, with backing from RSF. The rooms are named after the top French media organisations, which provide half of the running costs. The remainder comes from the European Commission. EJN, which was officially launched in October 2005, says it is in touch with 167 journalists who have fled here to escape persecution. Six of them, who are having difficulties with their applications for asylum, are destitute. The project is being coordinated by Dr Ibrahim Seaga Shaw, former editor of the newspaper ExpoTimes, who was forced to flee Sierra Leone in 1998 after his name was published on a death list circulated to government militias. He had been subjected to imprisonment and torture because of his work since 1992. \"The Press Freedom House will provide accommodation and other support facilities to help exiled journalists adjust to their new environment in the UK,\" he says. \"Above all it will provide them with assistance in their asylum applications and the integration process \" The idea is supported by media organisations across the UK. In a letter to EJN, Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: \"With Britain recognised worldwide as a bastion of democracy and free speech, media professionals here must be happy to welcome journalists who have been forced out of their countries because of their work. Having a Press Freedom House to provide basic initial support could certainly be a first practical step to achieving this. I am sure that editors everywhere will be pleased to know that a project like this existed if any of their colleagues were to get into difficulty with the authorities.\" Chris Elliott, managing editor at the Guardian, says: \"Alan Rusbridger and all journalists at the Guardian wholeheartedly support efforts to provide a refuge and a new base from which people can rebuild their lives and careers, ensuring they can continue the fight for the fundamental values which all journalists share.\" EJN was set up with the help of the National Union of Journalists and the media ethics charity MediaWise Trust. Its patrons include journalists Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, the head of Channel 4 News's China bureau Lindsey Hilsum, journalist and Royal African Society director Richard Dowden, and former president of the National Union of Journalists Tim Lezard. In recent years there has been a frightening increase in the number of media professionals killed, imprisoned or harassed. According to RSF, 63 journalists were killed in the line of duty in 2005. The figure already stands at 53 this year.

A \u00a35m revamp was announced, but advertisers complained they had not been consulted, and departing journalists said editorial standards would be compromised. The results of the revamp are revealed this week. The outcome is certainly fresher: the earnest tone is modified, there is a splash of colour on every page, and the masthead comes in red, green and blue. The most eyecatching detail is that it also includes an aspirational glossy magazine, targeted at style-conscious younger female teachers - and consumer advertisers. \"It's about you as well as education,\" says veteran editor Judith Judd, who adds that the relaunch is the result of a major piece of reader research. Accordingly the page 5 feature captures the mood, with a big picture of a head teacher, Julie Rose, riding her chestnut thoroughbred through the surf on a Dorset beach. A sidebar called \"fact and fiction\" rams home how pay has changed - teachers earned an average \u00a32,360 in 1974, now it is \u00a332,760. The new magazine has plenty of practical advice - how to integrate Polish children, handle disruptive parents, where to go for computer training and what to do about children who always arrive at lessons late. The relaunch edition has 48 pages of job ads, the paper's bread and butter, and the website has also been refreshed.As is to be expected from a redesign led by the former Guardian designer David Hillman, it all looks very good. The question for the discerning TES audience is whether there is enough substance to support the style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
