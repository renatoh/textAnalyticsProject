Given the volatile climate he arrives, straight bat at the ready, intent to defuse and dampen. It was all steady and predictable enough before this weekend\u2019s visit of Manchester United when the line of questions suddenly took an unexpected bounce. What did Wenger think of Mesut \u00d6zil renewing the Tarmac on his driveway? Pause. Was this a trick question? Wenger looked momentarily baffled. What does Tarmac on a drive have to do with Arsenal\u2019s predicament? The inquisitor clarified with the suggestion that maybe doing some home improvements meant \u00d6zil wanted to stick around a while. A promising sign for the contract situation, perhaps. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good conclusion,\u201d Wenger replied cheerfully, enjoying a brief moment of levity. Here is the thing, though. \u00d6zil\u2019s form has dipped to the point where the handsome offer, on the table for ages, has become a serious debating point. Arsenal are not in the business of routinely offering players in the region of the \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3300,000 per week mooted to tempt \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez. So when they do it really needs to be worth that extra push. There was a point earlier in the season when \u00d6zil began to look more than ever like the technical leader and inspirer-in-chief Arsenal were eager to pin their hopes on. On 1 November he scored a virtuoso goal that was the talk of Europe, a matchwinner at Ludogorets that seemed to crystallise a new sense the player was keyed up to score goals and influence games more directly than the stereotype of \u00d6zil the floating, vulnerable muse. He scored nine goals in 20 games leading up to December. It felt different. More anchored in notable determination. Arsenal allowed themselves to wonder whether he had evolved enough to be their cake as well as the cherry on top. But the subsequent months \u2013 retreating to a period of quiet ineffectiveness on the periphery as the team struggled desperately for mojo \u2013 have allowed all the old reservations to resurface. There are too many divisive figures at Arsenal these days and \u00d6zil has again become a figure that splits opinion. The purists cling to his inherent ability. The doubters wonder how he invariably seems to stay on for a full 90 minutes when he drifts through games. Is that form convincing enough to merit one of the most expensive salary offers the club has ever drummed up? In his autobiography, Die Magie des Spiels [The Magic of the Game], \u00d6zil noted how Jos\u00e9 Mourinho accused him of not giving everything during their time together at Real Madrid, quoting the manager as saying: \u201cYou think two beautiful passes are enough. You think you\u2019re so good that 50% is enough.\u201d Wenger agrees \u00d6zil is a character who benefits from some tough love. \u201cWe had some good conversations with him as well, you know,\u201d he says. Not for the first time, Wenger is compelled to offer up a defence of \u00d6zil while the critics sharpen their opinion of someone who can be an easy target because of his languid style. \u201cBig players have to carry the responsibility of the team. People look at it like that,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cLast Sunday [at Tottenham] to just criticise Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s performance does not reflect exactly what happened on the pitch. I think he did fight very hard in recent games \u2013 we looked at his physical performance and they were at a very high level. But like the rest of the team on Sunday we were below what we produced recently. The big players get more criticised than the others. His style is more fluid, less aggressive, but it doesn\u2019t mean you want it less than others. \u201cAt the end of the day his style is his style and what you measure with Mesut \u00d6zil is the efficiency. His basic quality is retention and the creation of goal chances.\u201d Even in this patchy season \u00d6zil is currently the Premier League\u2019s top passer in the opposition half, with a success rate that exceeds Eden Hazard and Christian Eriksen. Wenger had an intriguingly evasive reply to a question about whether it suits \u00d6zil to carry the kind of responsibility usually handed to the highest-profile players. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he embraces the challenge to play big games. Does he embrace the challenge to be criticised? I\u2019m not sure. Does he like to be criticised? I\u2019m not sure. \u201cYou want all your players to be at their best in every single game so when they don\u2019t achieve that of course you are frustrated but we all played football. We know we are only human beings and you have to accept the ups and downs.\u201d Does this drop in form make Wenger reconsider the sense in the massive contract on offer? \u201cBefore we spend big money we analyse all the aspects of commitments, because we have not only Mesut \u00d6zil and S\u00e1nchez to extend. We have many other players to extend and you have to make sure you have the resources available to extend the other players that you think are needed to be successful in the future. For example, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is part of that.\u201d The great \u00d6zil debate becomes a broader Arsenal-related discourse with the bigger picture question: can you build a team around him? The answer should be yes \u2013 as long as the other component parts are complementary and forgiving of the foibles of a delicate craftsman. Would \u00d6zil have flourished more in a Wenger team which had a midfield with the power and precision of Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit behind him rather than the struggles of Granit Xhaka and Aaron Ramsey? Would he have produced more with the runs of Thierry Henry to aim for instead of Olivier Giroud? The lack of balance in the team this season has not made for a perfect environment for \u00d6zil, even if he has not helped himself to the point that a tough old timer, Martin Keown, pulled few punches in his newspaper column this week when he claimed Arsenal \u201care simply carrying Mesut \u00d6zil and they cannot afford to\u201d. If too many big games are passing him by, \u00d6zil might remember that one of his best performances came in this fixture last season, when Arsenal defeated Manchester United 3-0. \u00d6zil was the architect of the opening goal and scorer of the second. He made a similar impact with Arsenal\u2019s highest-calibre display this term when they beat Chelsea by the same margin. The challenge to eke out more of those performances remains an Arsenal riddle, and it\u2019s one that will be under consideration during the summer if \u00d6zil\u2019s contract extension stays unsigned. That begs the question of which clubs might queue up to spend lavishly on this gossamer talent and match or exceed those big wages for class that has not shone consistently for Arsenal. Have there been any offers, any signs of interest from other clubs? \u201cNo,\u201d says Wenger bluntly. After another pause he offers a cryptic addendum. \u201cNot officially.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
