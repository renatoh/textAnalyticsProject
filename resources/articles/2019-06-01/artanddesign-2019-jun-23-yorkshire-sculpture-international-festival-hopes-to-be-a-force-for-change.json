Back then politicians weren\u2019t interested, local residents and businesses didn\u2019t understand it and the only people in favour seemed to be artists, says Murray. \u201cIn the early days there was the constant battling and fighting for funds. Then there\u2019s the politics of the art world and the politics of regional and national government. We had to be incredibly strong willed and bloody minded.\u201d More than 40 years later the stubbornness appears to have paid off. The YSP is at the heart of Yorkshire Sculpture International (YSI), a new festival taking place across Leeds and Wakefield. There\u2019s a Damien Hirst statue in the middle of Briggate, the main shopping street in Leeds. Down the road there\u2019s new work by Rashid Johnson and Cauleen Smith. Five Yorkshire-based sculptors are being supported throughout the 100-day event. The official line is that the Rhubarb Triangle has become the Sculpture Triangle with Leeds Art Gallery, the Henry Moore Institute and the award-winning the Hepworth Wakefield making this area of West Yorkshire arguably the best place in Europe to see sculpture. Murray is hopeful the event will help to further the area\u2019s credentials as an arts mainstay. He uses the German city of Kassel as an example of a place transformed by hosting the Documenta international arts event. There was controversy in Kassel last year over Olu Oguibe\u2019s 50ft (15-metre) obelisk, which the words \u201cI was a stranger and you took me in\u201d written on it in Turkish, Arabic, German, and English. The city was proposing to buy the sculpture to keep permanently, but there were protests by far-right politicians before it eventually returned to the city. In the febrile Brexit atmosphere any use of public space or money can become similarly politicised. Brian Alexander is looking up at Huma Bhabha\u2019s Receiver, a green and black humanoid figure that stands between the city\u2019s county hall, its police headquarters and a statute of Queen Victoria. \u201cIf you want people from Wakefield to be onside, this is an old-fashioned mining community and this doesn\u2019t wash,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the civic centre of the town and I think you need something more \u2026 civic.\u201d Alexander shows me a Facebook exchange he had the night before with a young woman who said she was happy about YSI coming to the area. He disagreed with her and thinks the average Wakefield resident would question the need for the event when the city has lost \u00a3171m of council budget cuts over eight years. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have the right idea,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re saying \u2018why has the council spent so much money on that? The money could be spent better on something we need more\u2019.\u201d Funding for the festival comes in the form of a \u00a3750,000 grant from the Arts Council, which covers around half of the cost. The other half comes from partners including Wakefield council, 2023 Leeds, the University of Leeds and more than a dozen others. Godfrey Worsdale, the director of the Henry Moore Foundation, says there would be collective disappointment if fewer than a million visitors saw YSI, and he wants local residents to make up a large portion of attendees. \u201cPeople in Yorkshire have got to be involved,\u201d he says. \u201cIt needs to be internationally ambitious and locally relevant, and sculpture feels like something everyone can get around.\u201d For Simon Wallis, the director of the Hepworth Wakefield, the Brexit referendum result in the city \u2013 66.4% of voters were in favour of leaving the EU \u2013 means his gallery has to play a bigger role in keeping the city outward facing. \u201cWhen Nigel Farage came here people were over the moon, the turnout was incredible. It\u2019s terrifying, it really is,\u201d Wallis says. \u201cIt makes me think that with this place we need to redouble our efforts and fuck the notion of coming up with lowest common denominator to please lots of people. You need to keep it international to keep people\u2019s minds and imaginations open.\u201d Wallis\u2019s uncompromising approach could be informed by the fact he has had to face and overcome pessimism before the Hepworth Wakefield opened in 2011. \u201cI arrived in 2008 and the financial crash was happening and people were saying \u2018no one will ever come\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we have 250,000 visitors a year and a third of them are from the local area.\u201d Murray echoes Wallis\u2019s sentiments about art \u2013 and sculpture in particular \u2013 being a potential force for change, reiterating that people now embrace the YSP after not understanding it initially. \u201cNow 99% of people who come think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes time and if you\u2019ve never had contemporary sculpture in the centre of Wakefield or the centre of Middlesbrough or Leeds, it makes people sit up. But art can be and should be provocative.\u201d Wallis sees a potential positive for the arts in West Yorkshire after the current political situation calms \u2013 a move to a more devolved system. \u201cOne of the good things that could come out of this is the notion of a devolution outside of London, and that these world class and challenging experiences could be there for everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to water something down just because it\u2019s in the regions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
