The Welsh team were unbeaten in nine league matches coming into this game but first Andrea Orlandi, a Spaniard formerly of Swansea, and then Argentina's Jos\u00e9 Leonard Ulloa slowed down their charge towards the Premier League \u2013 one with a smartly taken goal just before the interval and the other on the break in the last section of stoppage time at the end. For a long time it was impossible to envisage such an outcome, especially as after two minutes Fraizer Campbell threatened to make it four goals in four games since his \u00a3600,000 transfer from Sunderland, clipping the top of the crossbar with a shot from six yards. Cardiff were dominant throughout, their scoring chances running into double figures, but they ran into Tomasz Kuszczak in the sort of form that once made him Manchester United's goalkeeper. The 30-year-old Poland international was man of the match by a country mile, producing one save from Craig Conway of the highest class. By the time the match was 20 minutes old Kuszczak had hurtled to his right to keep out a curling 25-yarder from Peter Whittingham and enjoyed a remarkable slice of luck when he fumbled a left-to-right shot from Craig Bellamy and looked up, beaten, to see the ball bounce on to his crossbar and out again. He deserved his good fortune, going on to redeem himself in style with a double save from Bellamy, first thwarting the veteran's attempt to take the ball round him, then repelling his follow-up attempt. It was good goalkeeping but Bellamy should have scored. When Brighton at last fashioned a decent chance, David Marshall distinguished himself with a reflex save to keep out a thumping drive. Diligent last-ditch blocking by their central defenders kept Brighton on terms until the 43rd minute when, to general amazement, they took the lead. A right-wing cross from David Lopez found the Cardiff defence wanting and Orlandi stole in to slide the ball across Marshall and inside his far upright. Campbell, at the far post, should have done better with his header from Bellamy's corner, then the one-cap England striker was culpable again with an inaccurate shot. Even after the goal it was all Cardiff but, when Kuszczak was not thwarting them, their final pass or their finishing let them down. That said, credit is due to Brighton for their assiduous defending. Typically on the night Aron Gunnarsson shot straight at the goalkeeper, then headed an inviting cross from Conway horribly wide at the far post. Cardiff maintained the pressure and Conway, with a siege gun blast, was denied by Kusczak's save of the night. As a last throw of the dice Mackay sent on Heidar Helguson in place of Campbell but the old campaigner could not succeed where younger men had failed and in added time Ulloa fastened on to a centre from David Lopez and scored through Mark Hudson's attempted block. The identity of the referee had not helped Cardiff. Keith Stroud had refereed Cardiff's 5-4 defeat at Charlton in November, not to mention the 6-0 drubbing at Preston on the last day of the season that cost Dave Jones' team a place in the play-offs four years ago. He further alienated himself from the Cardiff crowd after an hour when Bellamy, cutting into the penalty area from the left, was brought down by El-Abd two feet inside the box. The referee awarded a free-kick just outside and it came to nothing. His birthday ruined, Mackay said: \"We penned them in and ended up with 22 attempts on target, which is incredible. I thought a goal was coming because of the pressure but it became one of those nights. Their goal led a charmed life. \"Sometimes it was poor finishing, sometimes it was the goalkeeper who kept us out. It was a bit of everything. We should have had a penalty, the referee got that one wrong. It was a big decision and he got it wrong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
