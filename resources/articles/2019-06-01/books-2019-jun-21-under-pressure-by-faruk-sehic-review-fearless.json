Originally published in 2004 but only now available in English, Under Pressure is a collection of short stories inspired by his time as a combatant in the Bosnian war of the 1990s. They tell of towns devastated by aerial bombing, of streets and rivers littered with corpses. A dead soldier has had his eyes pecked out by birds: \u201cHis eyelashes looked monstrous, trimming two empty eye sockets like sunflower petals bordering the pistil.\u201d One war-weary narrator pours scorn on nationalist songs that urge people to \u201cbe part of a stained glass window where the dominant colour is that of human mince\u201d. \u0160ehi\u0107\u2019s protagonists purge themselves of trauma by bingeing on whatever they can lay their hands on \u2013 beer, weed, diazepam and the Bosnian fruit brandy, rakia \u2013 and regaling one another with cringe-inducing sexual banter. Scatological allusions abound. One story features a \u201cdog licking the haemorrhoid blood off the turd I shat out behind the shed this morning\u201d. \u0160ehi\u0107 pummels the reader with crassness and filth in order to convey the brute ugliness of war. Under Pressure was \u0160ehi\u0107\u2019s prose debut \u2013 he was 33 when it was first published \u2013 and it bears the telltale signs of early work. The prose is lively and fearless, but the narrative voice, with its distinct nod to the louche swagger of Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller, feels decidedly secondhand. The translator, Mirza Puri\u0107, has sought to render \u0160ehi\u0107\u2019s dialogue in an approximation of English working-class diction, for added realism. The execution is a little overcooked: a conspicuous superabundance of colloquialisms such as \u201cwell dodgy\u201d, \u201cyonks ago\u201d and \u201cbint\u201d, combined with a preponderance of studiously dropped consonants and aitches (\u201c\u2019E\u2019s not even a \u2019uman bein\u2019 any more\u201d), lends the speech a parodic quality redolent of the early days of Jamie Oliver. Rendering the vernacular with subtlety and conviction is the holy grail of literary translation; Puri\u0107 doesn\u2019t quite pull it off, but he is in good company. \u2022 Under Pressure by Faruk \u0160ehi\u0107, translated by Mirza Puri\u0107, is published by Istros (RRP \u00a39.99).
