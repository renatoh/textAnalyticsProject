On the eve of first practice for Sunday's US grand prix Max Mosley, president of the FIA, the sport's governing body, has published a discussion document aimed at cutting costs dramatically while bringing skill back to the race track. The sport has been criticised, particularly in recent years, for being soulless and dominated by technology. The FIA package represents the most dramatic raft of changes for a generation. They include: \u00b7Independent teams to be permitted to purchase \"complete cars, or any part of a car, from another constructor\". This is intended to save smaller teams considerable sums of money in the design and development of their cars and would allow, say, Minardi to purchase complete cars from McLaren. \u00b7A return to manual gearboxes and a total ban on traction control, which would put an added emphasis on driver skill. Gearboxes would be stan dardised and come from an approved supplier. \u00b7Strict limitations on electronics, with the use of FIA-approved software. This would not only provide the means to police the ban on traction control but also prevent teams from spending millions of dollars on their own electronic programmes. \u00b7Aerodynamic downforce levels to be cut by 90%. \u00b7A single tyre manufacturer to supply the championship, a sensitive issue since the performance of the Bridgestone tyres has particularly handicapped the Ferrari team this season and those teams using Michelin have benefited. The FIA said it was possible that some $2bn (\u00a31.15bn) was \"being completely wasted\" each year by formula one car manufacturers. Last year the Fiat-backed Ferrari squad spent $426m, Toyota $392m, McLaren-Mercedes $360m, BMW Williams $343m and BAR-Honda $340m, sums which all agree cannot be sustained. \"Formula one must not be allowed to become a money-spending competition,\" said Mosley. \"We need more emphasis on rules which allow a clever but underfunded team to defeat a less competent but richer rival. It must not be possible simply to buy success. This is essential for the survival of the independent teams which rely on sponsorship and income from the commercial rights holder.\" Mosley also claims his changes are seeking to address \"the manufacturers' dilemma\" whereby, however much the six car makers collectively spend, only one can win, and each season one at least is going to finish with cars in 11th and 12th places or worse in the drivers' world championship. \"We are not satisfied with the sixth and seventh place [in the races] and we are in intensive discussions on how to do better,\" Dr Helmut Panke, the chief executive of BMW, said recently. The FIA hopes the cost-cutting measures will head off the threat of a breakaway championship which has been mooted for 2008 at the end of the current Concorde agreement. It is 23 years since formula one had such a seismic realignment, when ground- effect aerodynamics, relying on inverted-wing-profile underbody sections to generate downforce, were banned by the FIA. On that occasion, at the end of the 1982 season, the governing body wanted to control spiralling lap speeds by limiting the cars' grip. \"Formula one has become divorced from reality,\" warned Mosley. \"If you ask a man in the street how many people devote their entire working lives to putting two formula one cars on the grid 17 times a year, he will probably reply 20 or 30. \"The reality is about 300 for a small team and up to 1,000 for a top team, all full-time employees. Most of these expensive people add nothing to the spectacle or the sporting contest. They are working on things the public never see. It is difficult to justify this on any rational basis.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
