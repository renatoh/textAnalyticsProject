He spent two years at Arsenal warming the bench, a spell at Southampton occupying another and when he arrived at Fulham it seemed merely a stopping-off station on a slow train down the Nationwide. Now he is a hot property. \"I wake up on Tuesday and people start calling me from Portugal linking me with Benfica,\" he said. \"But my agent knows nothing, so it is all speculation and I'm not going to give more words about that.\" Benfica are probably just the first of many clubs he is going to be linked with. The Portuguese, just 23, is on a season's loan from Southampton and if the Saints decide to cash in the Cottagers are determined to be first in line. \"You don't want to talk about individuals but there's a lot of top players in the team as far as I can see and there's no doubt in my mind, they won't be going anywhere - they'll be staying,\" the player-coach John Collins said. Boa Morte prefers to do his talking on the pitch. Gone is the radarless rocket that used to zoom through defences and then self-destruct. Now, under the patient priming of Jean Tigana, he has re-emerged as a smart missile, capable of destroying the tightest defence. Nottingham Forest had arrived with five across the back and a defensive midfielder Riccardo Scimeca making a sixth, but it only took an instant for Boa Morte to pick up a long clearance, tear in on goal, then lob the ball across to Louis Saha who only had to swivel his hips to notch his 19th league goal this season. \"I think he is a very good player and it's a good partnership because we have a good understanding and every game we play better,\" said Saha. More importantly as the young Frenchman struggles to retain his touch after a draining winter the more physical Boa Morte, with 13 goals of his own, is assuming the responsibility for leading the line. Fulham are now 10 points ahead of Bolton and 19 clear of third-placed Blackburn. David Platt's much-improved side remain one place off the play-offs. There is still a suspicion that the Forest manager over-complicates their tactics in the hurly-burly of the First Division but in the second half at least they were a match for Fulham, almost stealing a point when Chris Bart-Williams' rasping free-kick came back off the underside of the crossbar. \"I think we did enough to take something out of the game but we didn't do so, perhaps because of a lack of quality with our final ball. If we play like that until the end of the season we'll win more than we lose and there's a good chance we'll get into a final play-off position,\" Platt said. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
