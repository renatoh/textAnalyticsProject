With Toulon on course to win Pool Three and all the second-placed teams in the other four pools better placed than the Tigers at the start of the fifth round, victory may not even be enough \u2013 and Leicester are unlikely to meet a defence akin to that of the Scarlets, which resembled unset putty. The Welsh team were without six injured international players and were reduced to their fourth-choice hooker in their quest for a first away victory for 11 months. Their defence was fourth-rate, as first-up tacklers were brushed off far too easily. The first five of Leicester\u2019s six tries all came as a result of the Tigers opting for set pieces rather than taking kickable penalties. Leicester\u2019s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, reckoned in the build-up to the game that his side would need two bonus-point victories to have a chance of qualifying from the pool, and it took the Tigers 53 minutes to achieve the first bonus point. They had led 14-11 at the interval through tries from Miles Benjamin and Jordan Crane from lineouts, the first after the ball was moved wide and the second after the forwards drove a maul at speed. It was only the home side\u2019s indiscipline, especially at the breakdown, that kept the Scarlets in touch. Even allowing for their absentees and a playing budget some way below Leicester\u2019s, the Scarlets were inexcusably deficient without the ball. They were slick when in possession, Scott Williams especially creative in midfield, but they fell off too many first-up tackles, starting with the first of the game, when Jordan Williams went half-heartedly high rather than slamming into the wing on the touchline and injured his shoulder in the process. Leicester took an early grip on the game, 14-3 ahead on 15 minutes after Rhys Priestland had given the Scarlets the lead with a penalty. But when Graham Kitchener, a sixth-minute replacement for the second-row Brad Thorn, was sent to the sin-bin because of his side\u2019s constant infringing at the breakdown, the Scarlets scored a try from a driving lineout through the prop Rob Evans to supplement Priestland\u2019s second penalty. Hope at the interval quickly turned to despair for the Scarlets. Adam Thompstone\u2019s try seven minutes into the second-half was too simple for a tournament that includes the word \u2018champions\u2019 in its title, the ball passed along the line without any deception and there was little resistance to a driving maul shortly afterwards as Tom Youngs scored a try moments after coming off the bench. The hooker had his second three minutes later, again from a lineout after his brother Ben had made ground too easily. Having secured the bonus point they coveted, Leicester started conserving energy for the trip to Belfast. Their final try was scored by the replacement scrum-half Sam Harrison after Robert Barbieri\u2019s break and, though the wing Harry Robinson claimed two for the Scarlets, the match had long been won and lost. The Scarlets\u2019 defeat means that for the third successive year Wales will not be represented in the knockout stage. They had two of the match\u2019s stand-out players in Scott Williams and the second-row Jake Ball, but their injuries meant they were stretched too far, especially up front \u2013 not that they should be excused some of their terrible tackling. Leicester are never more dangerous than when their runners rampage their way over the gainline and the visitors struggled to contain the prop Logovi\u2019i Mulipola, making his first start since September. The Scarlets\u2019 flanker John Barclay left the field with a burst eardrum in the second-half. \u201cHaving watched the incident on video it was the result of a swinging arm, a cheap shot,\u201d said the Scarlets\u2019 head coach Wayne Pivac, who refused to name the alleged culprit. \u201cLogo made a big difference to us,\u201d said Cockerill, who added that he did not know whether the England centre Manu Tuilagi, who has not played since October, would be fit to play against Ulster, his last chance of playing time before the start of the Six Nations. \u201cWe were clinical but we will need another five points against Ulster and, depending on how the other groups pan out, even that may not be enough.\u201d Leicester Tait; Thompstone, Goneva, Bai, Benjamin (Smith, 71); Burns (Williams, 60), B Youngs (capt; Harrison, 60); Rizzo (Ayerza, 51), Ghiraldini (T Youngs, 51), Mulipola (Balmain, 55), Thorn (Kitchener, 5), Parling, Croft, Salvi (Barbieri, 60), Crane.
