Now the in thing is to have your house blessed. It emerged this week that the Church of England is so desperate to fill its pews that it has joined forces with that unholiest of professions - the estate agent - to offer people moving house the chance to have their new home blessed. Churches across Manchester have placed cards with local estate agents, inviting people who are interested in the service to get in touch with their local vicar. People can have prayers said in their new home, holy water sprinkled in rooms and blessings given to family members. Brazilian experts wax lyrical: Would you be nuts to buy an investment property in Brazil? Not according to property investment company Prestige Group, which this week launched a new \"international hotspots index\". It reckons the top overseas hotspot at the moment is Warsaw because it offers excellent value for money and strong price growth (18% last year), but the firm's boss Paul Coghlan says Brazil is the place we will be hearing a lot about over the next year or two. \"Brazil has great potential for the future. It is embryonic for foreign investors at the moment but is definitely one to watch.\" London-based Brazilian real estate firm Property Bond says you can pick up two-bedroom detached villas and apartments from \u00a325,000, and claims some parts of north-east Brazil are seeing annual price growth of 20%-plus. Shaken and stirred: He may be 75 years old, but Sean Connery still holds a licence to thrill, according to a new \"sexy pensioners poll\" in which he trounced the UK opposition. Mr Connery received a massive 52% of the votes - well ahead of second-placed Patrick Stewart, who took 19% of the votes. Somewhat alarmingly, racing commentator and ex-Celebrity Big Brother inmate John McCririck made it into the top 20 - albeit with a score of 0.3%. In the UK female category, the poll revealed that Helen Mirren is still the nation's favourite mature pin-up, receiving 21% of the votes. Sexiest Hollywood male and female pensioner were Paul Newman and Goldie Hawn respectively. The research was carried out for Virgin Money Pensions. Red letter days: The Prudential this week became the latest big insurer to announce it is setting final deadlines for customers to complain about being mis-sold endowment policies - as predicted in Guardian Money two weeks ago. The company will be soon writing to the 110,000 Prudential and Scottish Amicable mortgage endowment policyholders who have in the past received \"red\" letters warning them there is a high risk that their policy will not grow sufficiently to pay off their home loan. The letters, which are going out over the next few weeks, will warn these people that in most cases they have just six months in which to lodge a complaint. After that, they will be barred from seeking compensation. Dirty jokes: Some of Guardian Money's more politically correct readers may want to skim over this item. For it is our duty to report that the good people at Asda have decided to quiz the nation about a matter of vital importance to us all. No, not \"When should Tony Blair go?\" or \"Was Eriksson right to pick Theo Walcott?\" but: \"What's your favourite slogan that you've seen scrawled on the back of a dirty white van?\" And the nation's answer was... \"If only my wife was this dirty\". Asda's financial services arm has a new service aimed at helping van drivers find the best insurance deals on the market. Braving a storm: One of Britain's oldest friendly societies, Hearts of Oak, is in a spot of financial bother. The 164-year-old mutual with almost 50,000 policyholders has written to members to say it has failed to meet the Financial Services Authority's solvency requirements. \"Assets continue to exceed liabilities,\" says the letter. \"However, that excess does not currently meet the minimum required by the regulator.\" The Leicester-based company says it is working hard to address the situation and that members \"can have full confidence that the society's position is being kept under constant review by the board of directors\". However, it acknowledges this might be a good time for policyholders to seek independent financial advice as to what they should do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
