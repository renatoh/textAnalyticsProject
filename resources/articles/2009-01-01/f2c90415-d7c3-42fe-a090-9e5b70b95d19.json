Many of his Premier League peers are control freaks who struggle to delegate but Sunderland's new manager is worried that he is not spending sufficient time on the training pitch with his players and wants to off-load certain responsibilities. \"Management is much more difficult than I ever thought,\" admitted Sbragia yesterday, who has experienced a sharp culture shock since succeeding Roy Keane. \"Being a caretaker was a doddle as I didn't have total responsibility. \"I am thinking about bringing somebody in, possibly above me, to take a lot of that load off me so I can spend more time on the training ground. I don't want to be office bound and I think it is important that the manager is out on the training pitch. That's where the manager should be.\" Keane, particularly during the latter stages of his time at Sunderland, typically took training only once or twice a week and began commuting from his Cheshire home by helicopter rather than by car. Extremely hands-on when it came to transfers, Keane would have been outraged at the idea of devolving such duties to an intermediary but his successor is a very different managerial animal. \"I have discussed it with my chairman, Niall Quinn, and we might need a continental type structure,\" said Sbragia. \"We will consider bringing someone in above me. It wouldn't be someone to become my boss but to deal with the agents and everyday matters so as to let me get out on the training field. It would be someone I trust and know.\" Stressing that any appointment would be made on his terms and aware that continental style hierarchies often provoke controversy in English football, Sbragia explained that, although the new man would boast many of the powers enjoyed by a typical director of football, he would lack a grandiose title to match them. \"When I say above me, I don't mean in terms of title, I mean in the sense he would deal with the ugly stuff,\" said Sbragia. \"It would be an assistant manager. The big thing is that it's someone I know. Trust is important to me. It won't be anyone the people upstairs have suggested. I have someone in mind and I'm discussing it with him.\" With Tony Loughlan, Keane's former assistant, on gardening leave while his severance settlement is finalised, Sbragia's backroom is essentially two bodies light. Accordingly he may also look to recruit a new first-team coach to assist Neil Bailey, who is currently training both the senior squad and the reserves. If Bailey feels he is being stretched thin, Sbragia, who is close to signing at least one new defender, presently struggles to find sufficient hours in the day. \"The manager's workload has always been a concern to me,\" said the former Sunderland, Bolton and Manchester United coach. \"I do enjoy the job but yesterday, for instance, I had a morning training session and then, from 3pm until 10pm I was on the phone to agents about players and a lot of it was what I regard as wasted time. \"I am a novice, though, so maybe when the transfer window closes it will be much better for me and I just have to suffer this until the second of February.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
