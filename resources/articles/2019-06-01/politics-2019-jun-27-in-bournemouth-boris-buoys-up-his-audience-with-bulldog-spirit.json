Two men repeating the same unchallenged lines at different hustings around the country in a format designed to stifle debate. Not so much an election as a coronation march. They\u2019d been queuing round the block outside the art-deco Pavilion Theatre in Bournemouth two hours before the start. Six hundred Tory members \u2013 mostly retired and overwhelmingly white. And almost all of them had come to hear just one man. In recent weeks Boris Johnson has looked under the cosh. Disconnected from himself, distracted both by the emptiness of his ambition and the psychodrama of his private life. He had been far from convincing in the first hustings in Birmingham and his two most recent radio interviews could both best be described as car wrecks. The Bournemouth audience had made it their mission to make Johnson whole again. For only if he was whole could they themselves be complete. Their need is mutual. Johnson cannot survive without applause and the ovation he received when he walked on stage gave him a visible lift. The relief was almost tangible as Johnson went into one of his standard Boris rants, full of bad puns, classical allusions, empty promises and outright lies. No one cared that he clearly didn\u2019t have a Brexit plan. All that anyone wanted to know was that he was feeling better about himself. As so often with Johnson, this really was all about him. After indulging in a little call and response with the audience, Johnson sat down to be interviewed by CNN presenter, Hannah Vaughan Jones. Why did he want to be prime minister? Everyone knew that the real reason was because he believes it to be his birthright, but everyone just played along as he mumbled something about having \u2018an overwhelming sense of responsibility\u2019. Something no one \u2013 especially his friends and family \u2013 had ever previously detected in him. The sense of collective delusion was maintained throughout. He couldn\u2019t think of any downsides to his immigration points system because he hadn\u2019t actually given the idea much thought at all. It was just some idea dreamed up by his team to move the conversation away from his character. At one point he couldn\u2019t even remember he was in Bournemouth. Then why should he? Bournemouth was where the little people lived and they should just be grateful he was donating them an hour of his time. On and on the nonsense went. Brexit just needed a bit more resolve. If the UK displayed some more bulldog spirit then the EU would cave in. He had it on the highest authority \u2013 his imagination \u2013 that he was hugely respected in Brussels. The reality is that everyone there thinks he\u2019s a bit of a tosser and doesn\u2019t trust him an inch. He wouldn\u2019t prorogue parliament, but then again he might. No matter. He carried on bluffing his way through, promising tax cuts for the rich but higher spending on the NHS and schools. \u201cWe need to love up those we want to lead,\u201d he declared. Under the circumstances not the best choice of words, but the audience didn\u2019t care. They felt loved up. At the end of the hour Johnson bounced off stage, his ambition to be \u2018World King\u2019 one step nearer. It hadn\u2019t been a vintage performance but it had been good enough. Boris knows that all he has to do to become prime minister is not screw up. Lies and evasion wins the day. There was one lone cheer \u2013 possibly from his wife \u2013 and a smattering of polite applause when Jeremy Hunt got his turn. Ken Doll came out determined to give it his all. Jacket off, he channelled his inner Action Man and walked about the stage trying desperately to find one person with whom to engage. He drew a few grudging claps but he quickly sensed he was sucking the energy out of the room. The audience hadn\u2019t come to hear his routine and he knew it. There was nothing he could do to change people\u2019s hearts and minds. Even if Boris was to sleep with their wives and murder their pets, he\u2019d still get their vote. That was precisely the get up and go spirit the Conservative party had been missing. Though they might draw the line if he declared he was a Muslim. Long before the end, people began to sneak out. It was nearly 8.30 and getting late. Ken carried on gamely, buoyed by a few loyal cheerleaders from his campaign team, but he looked relieved when it was all over. Most of his answers had been more truthful and realistic than Johnson\u2019s but that was his problem. The Tories don\u2019t want truth and realism. They want someone who peddles nostalgia and lies. And in Boris they have their guru."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
