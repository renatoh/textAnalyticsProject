This 40th birthday celebration of Richard Branson's baby spans two discs (plus a six-track bonus disc), and at its very heart there is, as the liner notes state, \"a desire to challenge conceptions and be risk-takers\". Post-1977, the danger appears to have petered out \u2013 in fact there's something a little Jeremy Clarkson about this drivetime-pop pick'n'mix. But there is always that lustrous Virgin sheen, a cinematic ostentation to the music \u2013 from Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight through Massive Attack's Unfinished Sympathy to Air's Sexy Boy. Its latter half \u2013 the economy-saving Emeli Sand\u00e9, the new EDM overlords \u2013 does prompt the question: will we be listening to Deadmau5 in 40 years? Probably not. But will Virgin still be releasing hit records? Absolutely yes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
