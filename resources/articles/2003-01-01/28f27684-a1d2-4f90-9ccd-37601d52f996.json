So what a surprise then that it has in fact fallen from the trustworthy and in-no-way-slavering lips of everybody's favourite football hero, Franchise FC chairman Charles Koppel. Koppel was in the process of announcing that his club, which can slide down the divisions into oblivion passing AFC Wimbledon on the way up for all the Fiver cares, could well play their first game in Milton Keynes before the end of the season. This is because he's sold everyone up the river, sorry, agreed a deal to move into the National Hockey Stadium. Which is in Milton Keynes and not Merton, you'll note. \"We are delighted that the National Hockey Stadium will be our temporary home,\" he said in a pre-prepared statement, almost as if he was ashamed to show his weasely face in public. \"This agreement has created a win-win situation for all concerned,\" he laughably added, possibly without reference to anyone who ever supported the club he took away from them. Koppel is confident of attracting an average of at least 6,000 fans to watch Franchise FC in Milton Keynes. Now if he's right, there are 6,000 people who should feel very ashamed of themselves. In fact, there are 6,001 if you count Koppel. Which we do. Oh we do. IT ALL COMES OUT IN THE WASH When Gerard Houllier has his big bulging washing-machine eyes on spin cycle, he can whiz through heavy loads of work at top speed. Which is just as well, for today he was so busy his eyeballs very nearly span out of their sockets. First of all, he had to see some people from the RSPCA about his alleged mistreatment of club dog Abel Xavier. They ended up finding the peroxide Portugeezer a new home at Galatasaray, so long as he makes it through quarantine. \"We will bring the player to Istanbul after he has signed the agreement but Xavier has to go to Portugal first to pick some stuff up,\" said his new owner and Galatasaray director of football Burak Elmas. Then the FA rang up and told Houllier to log on to their jazzy website, www.thefa.com, so they could inform him of the date set to find out why Steven Gerrard took a leisurely stroll across Gary Naysmith's scrotal area last month. \"We can confirm that Steve Gerrard's hearing will take place on February 3 at a venue to be confirmed,\" the site began, freestyle. Then the fretless bass set off on a meandering, funkadelic solo in 23/7 to add: \"The FA has requested a video ... to examine an incident involving Neil Warnock and Stephane Henchoz.\" Suddenly, the whole ensemble crashed in a cacophony of cymbals, allowing Houllier's eyes to slow until they fixed on just one thing: Southampton's French fancy Fabrice Fernandes. Not that Houllier is at all interested, of course. \"I have been linked with four or five players this morning which is quite good for someone who has said there will be no transfers at this club before January 31,\" he said, secreting a dossier entitled 'Fabrice Fernandes: All You Need to Know' down his y-fronts. Fabrice isn't bothered either. \"I owe all this interest to Gordon Strachan who has helped me find my belief again!\" As well as a new club? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I think he's a great defender ... I like playing with him ... it would be nice to play some more games with him\" - The talents of Jonathan Woodgate are analysed in stark simplicity by Leeds team-mate Dominic Matteo, 6, who stops just short of opining that Woody is really, really brilliant and the bestest ever. A LOAD OF PONY ABOUT TONY A cleft palate and club foot meant the Fiver didn't have many friends as a child. While other kids were scrumping apples and microwaving puppies, your informative daily football e-mail could be found sitting at home with only his trusty Rothmans Football Facts For Freaks for company. Small wonder, then, that recent weeks have seen the Fiver achieve unprecedented popularity among his peers around the globe, who have been bombarding it with requests in their thousands, looking for the answer to one particularly difficult doing-the-rounds teaser: \"Name the player who has played in all five of these derbies: Arsenal v Chelsea, Internazionale v AC Milan, Atletico Madrid v Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund v Borussia Moenchengladbach and Liverpool v Everton.\" The Fiver's original answer, that there is no answer because Borussia Dortmund v Borussia Moenchengladbach is not a derby, was roundly scoffed at by several breakfast-cereal buffs (corn flakes?) who claimed that - derby or no derby - feline Frosties figurehead Tony Tiger had played in all five fixtures in assorted adverts broadcast around Europe during the 1970s! \"It's a trick question, there's your answer, now let it lie,\" they snapped, crackled and popped. Determined not to be bested in the football trivia stakes, however, the Fiver started relentlessly haranguing a poor sod called Steve Bradley who speaks for Kellogg's to find out the truth. \"No, the answer is not Tony Tiger,\" he chortled, showing none of the gravitas such a serious query clearly merits. \"Tony never appeared with teams as such, and certainly not with all the ones you mentioned.\" Which means those of you who have been telling the Fiver otherwise aren't half as grrrrrrrrreeeeeaaaaat as you think you are after all. THE RUMOUR MILL Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has been giving \u00a34m-rated Portuguese World Cup hat-trick hero Pauleta the glad-eye. Tikka-tinged Terry Venables has admitted he will consider his position at Leeds United if Jonathan Woodgate is sold to Newcastle. Marcos thinks he's coming to Arsenal this month. Arsene Wenger knows otherwise. \"It was very premature to say he was signing,\" he said NEWS IN BRIEF Tottenham have signed Japanese World Cup star Kazuyuki Toda, subject to the midfielder passing a medical over the weekend. The 25-year-old Shimizu S-Pulse player has agreed terms on a one-year loan deal, and has been granted a work permit. Bordeaux defender David Sommeil has joined Manchester City on a three-and-a-half-year contract. \"I committed myself to Manchester for three seasons this morning and had my first training with the team,\" the French player said. Bolton manager Sam Allardyce has revealed he cannot afford to sign Derby striker Malcolm Christie. \"He's a player we have admired for a long time,\" said Allardyce. \"But we haven't the funds to bring him here.\" Paul Durkin will referee the Worthington Cup final between Liverpool and Manchester United on Sunday March 2. Nottingham Forest have completed the loan signing of Marseille midfielder Benjamin Gavanon. Aberdeen have signed of defender Michael Hart from Livingston. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV1: World Football (4:10am) \"To continue the pub/fallen hero sportsman theme, I have a non-snooker-related anecdote, but seeing as it involves snooker's first cousin once removed - darts - I thought you may be interested,\" writes Liam Kirwan. Actually, we still want your Alex Higgins stories, but we're prepared to make an exception in this case. Sky Sports 1: Soccer AM's All Sports Show (11pm) \"About four years ago, Mike Gregory, a one time world darts finalist and regular nine-dart charity chucker on Bullseye, was taking his exhibition matches around Bass pubs. In my local, the dog-rough Railway Hotel, the arrival of Gregory had been built up over several weeks. In a place where the ashtrays being emptied is a seminal moment, you can perhaps understand why the locals were all too easily whipped up into a frenzy. FA Cup Classics (1am) \"Prizes were promised for the regular who gave the best showing against Gregory and ham sandwiches were being laid on. To describe the night as a disappointment would be an understatement. It may be hard to imagine a darts player who has let himself go, but ... Sky Sports 3: FA Cup Classics (10pm) \"... Gregory turned up, in a battered old Vauxhall, wearing a battered old darts smock, which appeared to have been worn for his previous 24 exhibitions. The sandwiches had been constructed entirely from crusts, and their fillings stolen by a dozen drunken construction workers who'd stumbled into the pub. Newstalk 106: Off The Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) \"My showing of 54 as Gregory achieved his 501 made me look an idiot, but when you saw the sole prize he'd brought with him was a faded Bullseye t-shirt (size small) you had to smile. I pitied the man as I watched him eat the crust sandwiches and sausage roll carcasses, all minus their fillings. As a sporting performance it was woeful, as a performance of This Sporting Life it was theatrical tragedy.\" BBC Radio 5 Live: Sport On 5 (7pm) \"I don't know what he got paid for the night but I'd have been loathe to give him anymore than his BFH, as Jim Bowen might have said. That's black ... black again ... and ooh ... black again. Unlucky Mike.\" Talksport: Football First with Chris Cooper Your stories make it worth coming into work of a morning.
