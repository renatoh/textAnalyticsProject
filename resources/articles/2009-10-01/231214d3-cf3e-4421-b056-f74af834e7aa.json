Adrian Grenier plays a movie star on the show, but you can't imagine him opening on 3,000 screens nationwide over July Fourth Weekend in the real world. When Kevin Dillon steps offscreen, he simply goes back to being his big brother's little brother. Kevin Connolly is big-cast fodder, crowd-filler, too ginger to play in the big leagues (you doubt me? I give you \u2026 David Caruso), and Jerry Ferrara is just Turtle (not that there's a thing wrong with that). Jeremy Piven? Whole different story. The actor who plays Ari Gold, Grenier's ethically-challenged agent, is stepping out this week in The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard, which gives him his first starring role after a good two decades in Hollywood and some 80 movies and TV shows. It showcases the nasty, driven, wormy side of his work and has a little too much in common with Bob Zemeckis's Used Cars for my money. Somehow Ari, venomous, vengeful, venal and vile, has become one of the secret heroes of this our Second Gilded Age. It's the role of a lifetime for any actor willing to play loathsome at full tilt. Piven knows exactly how to do that, having built up a fine catalogue of creeps, losers, minor villains and bent cops over the years. Usually you see him in the lower reaches of big-budget studio projects: he's the crooked doctor in Heat who patches up Val Kilmer, and a cop in Kiss The Girls, he's in the mix in The Runaway Jury (who wasn't?), and in the dust-choked crowd somewhere in Black Hawk Down. (It's interesting to track the progress of his hairline backwards and forwards up his forehead in his old movies; presumably his hair is now on full, Sean Connery-level rug-drill.) And he makes a lot of movies with his childhood friend from back in Chicago, John Cusack who, along with his two sisters learned to act under the tutelage of Piven's acting-teacher parents. The Cusack connection tends to be problematic for Piven. He certainly has played a lot of small roles in movies starring his friend. I've been moved in the past to suggest that Piven's relationship with Cusack reminds me of gangster Dutch Schultz and the midget he kept on the payroll to tell him jokes when he was getting a shave. I think this may have been unfair. After all, Piven was in the cast of The Larry Sanders Show and in the Seinfeld pilot episode, either of which makes him some kind of royalty in my Pantheon of Telly Greatness. And if Robert Altman liked him enough to cast him in The Player, who can argue with his talent, even if he does drop out of a David Mamet play now and again for reasons that stink of \"dog-ate-my-homework\"? I'm glad for Piven. Two years before Entourage came calling he was playing people with names like \"Interviewer\" and \"Versace Salesman.\" These days, even the president knows his name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
