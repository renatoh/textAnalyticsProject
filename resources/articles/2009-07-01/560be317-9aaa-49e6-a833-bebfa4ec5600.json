Waiting for her the next morning was a book of rides she thought she might not see again for a whole year. \"I'd had so many nights of wondering,\" she says. \"I had one drink but I knew I was riding the next day so I knew I wanted an early night. Racing was all I wanted to do. There was no way I was going out on the drink the night before my first day back. I just lay there, thinking, oh my God, I'm riding tomorrow. I kept waking, really early.\" The smile was still on her face, a week later, as we talked. She spoke through a fixed mask of joy. Turner is Britain's best ever woman jockey. In December she became the first to ride 100 winners in a calendar year. Alex Greaves, her predecessor as female No1, took 15 years to reach 300 victories. Turner is the country's first champion apprentice, a title she shared, in 2005, with Saleem Golam. The trainer Marcus Tregoning has called her \"one of the top 10 jockeys in the country\". But in March this year it was almost snatched away from her, for ever. Imagine an average morning on the Newmarket gallops, where Turner routinely rides work before heading off to the track in search of winners. On this day, there will be blood. There will be life-threatening trauma and a 12-month suspension and a desperate appeal to have the long banishment overturned. First, though, there is the dead thoroughbred and the ambulance dash to Addenbrooke's hospital. Turner takes up the story: \"I was just jumping a horse out of the stalls, feeling surprised because it jumped well and I hadn't expected it to, getting it into stride then trying to pull it up, but it just broke its shoulder. I don't remember anything about that but apparently I was bleeding from the ears and nose, and I don't know if I was knocked out, but when they got to me I was wide awake, and I got up and walked to the ambulance. \"I never felt pain or anything, I don't remember a lot about it to be honest. I was in Addenbrooke's for three days. I was just eager to get back, I was down to ride one at Wolverhampton that day, and I was asking, am I going to get racing today?\" Tests showed memory loss and bruising to her brain and the British Horseracing Authority's medical specialists concluded that she should not ride for an entire year: a brutal setback for someone addicted to the thrill of flashing past a winning post. On a bench outside a weighing room, racetrack regulars stop to say well done, welcome back. She beams. Twelve months out might seem, on the scale of human tragedy, a minor inconvenience, but to Turner, 26, it removed the great animating force of her life. \"They explained the reason behind it, but I just think a year was too long. I can understand being stood down for that sort of injury. You'd definitely be off for three months to let the bruising go down, but a whole year was hard. I felt, 'What am I going to do for a whole year?' \" Three months after the media had proclaimed her a pioneer for women in a male-dominated sport, Turner might have feared the glory days were already over. \"No, because I didn't realise how serious it was,\" she says, dismissing that suggestion. \"It probably went through my mum's mind, and the friends who saw me there [in the hospital bed]. I felt fine, though I obviously wasn't.\" Banned from the weighing room, she was soon back riding work for Michael Bell, the Newmarket trainer who retains her, which only added to the anomaly of a pilot being allowed to ride half a ton of horse on the training ground but not round a track. The neurosurgeons at Addenbrooke's told her she had made a full recovery, so her thoughts turned to an appeal, to stave off mounting boredom and her deepening despair. Did she think the BHA's doctors treated her differently because she is a woman, considered her to be more delicate, or a greater PR risk? \"No. Not because I was a woman. No difference.\" The edge in her voice reflects her stern reluctance to play the female card. On 9 July she followed her two specialists, solicitor and barrister into a room where a three-man panel sat to consider her appeal. \"There was a crew. A big crew of us in there.\" Two and a half hours later she was told she could expect a call from the licensing authority soon. The liberation came five minutes into the ride home. \"Oh, it's just so good to be back. I've missed it so much. The last four months have just been horrible, not riding, because I'm so used to being busy all the time, and all of a sudden I'm doing nothing, waking up every morning thinking \u2013 what am I going to do today, how am I going to kill today? Just awful. \"If I wasn't 100% to ride there was no way they would have pushed me to appeal. There's no way my mum would have let me out. There's no way she would have let me race ride if I wasn't quite right. Everyone knew I was 100% and it was only fair for me to be back riding. \"All my friends and family have been so kind over the last four months, because I've been so fed up, I haven't been myself. They tried to keep me entertained, and my poor mum, she's been on the end of the phone, she's been very good.\" On the day of our conversation, the Racing Post carried a report of a seven-horse pile-up at Ayr, a broken jaw for one jockey, a cracked collarbone for another. Turner studied the pictures of sprawled legs and tumbling riders without anxiety. \"It [her accident] has made me safety conscious about things, like making sure my helmet and everything's done up properly. Stirrup leathers, things like that, but you can't think about things like that when you go out to ride. If it happens it happens. Everyone does their best to make it not.\" On her first day back, Turner drove to Ascot. \"There were no nerves because the excitement just took over. I thought there might be but there wasn't. I just couldn't wait to get back on a horse. In the weighing room everyone was kind, I got a cheer when I finished second. Everyone in the crowd was cheering. I'd been beaten a head. I'm very self-critical, always saying maybe I should have done this, maybe I should have done that, so I was bound to be a bit annoyed.\" The next day she rode a winner, at Nottingham, on only her second ride back. Turner's good looks are incidental to her talent but racing, a sport desperate to retain its place in the sporting culture, was bound to want to promote her as the new face of the game, as she is for the Derby. The billboard holds no appeal at all: \"I'm a jockey, nothing else. I did the face of the Derby and that wasn't up my street. I'm just rubbish at things like dressing up. I'm really not a clotheshorse at all.\" To complete her education, Bell sent her first to New Orleans and then Dubai. To toughen her up might have been one of his intentions, the neutral would assume, except that she was plenty tough enough already. \"I just learned so much in New Orleans. I was so focused on racing that boyfriends and friends and family were irrelevant. I said, 'I'm going to work over there for two months, it's beneficial.' I learned about the clock and about fitness. I rode 13 horses one morning. \"Some things just click when you're getting that much practice. You learned timing per furlong. It's really good experience. Any apprentice should go to America. In Dubai, Godolphin very kindly gave me a ride. Very similar. I got to sit on some really good horses. Get a feel of them.\" Inevitably we skirt the subject of her gender, and here she proves her inability to see herself as a novelty or special case. \"Sometimes I feel quite guilty because I get quite a lot of publicity and I think, 'there are guys in there [the weighing room] who've ridden Group winners and Classic winners and I get all this attention and I haven't even got close to what I want to achieve yet.' There's so much more I want to do and I don't' feel I've done enough to deserve it all. \"When I had a hundred winners at Wolverhampton I thought I might get 'star performance' in the Racing Post report, but then there was all this press and I couldn't believe it. George Baker did it two weeks before me, and another friend did it the week before, and I thought it would just be, 'Oh, well done.' Then there was all this attention. Obviously because I'm a girl, a bigger deal is made of it but I haven't done anything different to them. \"I don't really see myself that way. I see myself as a jockey, not a woman jockey.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
