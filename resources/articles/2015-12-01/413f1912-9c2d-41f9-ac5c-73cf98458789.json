On Sunday, the day before both he and Platini are expected to learn their fates, Swiss newspaper Blick asked Blatter about last week\u2019s eight-hour hearing with German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. \u201cThe judge told me at the start \u2018the corruption charges have been withdrawn,\u2019\u201d Blatter is reported to have said to the Swiss newspaper Blick. Both Blatter and Platini have said they believed their verbal contract was legal under Swiss law. However, Swiss law places a five-year time limit on such payments. The fact that the payments did not feature in Fifa\u2019s accounts is believed to form part of the case against them. In addition to the alleged corruption, the charges are based on four other potential breaches: mismanagement, conflict of interest, false accounting and non-cooperation with the ethics committee, amy of which, if proven, could lead to a substantial ban. Ethics investigators accept that proving corruption, which carries a lifetime ban, will be difficult. Investigators are very confident that other charges will be proved after a file running to more than 50 pages was submitted. Sources with knowledge of the case say sanctions handed down to other Fifa officials previously provide an indication of the level of the bans faced by Platini and Blatter. In July, Harold Mayne-Nichols, the official who headed the inspection team for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, was banned from all football-related activity for seven years for conflict of interest and breach of confidentiality. Former Fifa vice-president Chung Mong-joon from Korea was banned for six years in October for ethics code breaches that he said related to matters such as duty of disclosure, and confidentiality. Platini boycotted his hearing in Zurich on Friday in protest, claiming a decision already appeared to have been made. His lawyers attended, but it looks as though the Frenchman is already preparing to take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. His slim hopes of running for the Fifa presidency on February 26 would be finally ended by any sort of a ban however. The provisional suspensions imposed on him and Blatter in October mean he has been unable to carry out any campaigning. Blatter is unlikely to go quietly either as he faces an end to his four decades at the top of Fifa. The 79-year-old has called a news conference for Monday morning in Zurich in the same building that used to house Fifa before it moved to its new headquarters in 2006. He has already claimed in media interviews that the ethics committee has no power to remove him as president. The 2million Swiss franc payment at the centre of the case was made to Platini in February 2011. The Frenchman and Blatter deny any wrongdoing and say the payment was honouring an agreement made in 1998 for work carried out between 1998 and 2002 when Platini worked as a technical advisor for the Fifa president. The payment was not part of Platini\u2019s written contract but the pair have insisted that it was a verbal agreement which is legal under Swiss law. The timing of the payment has raised eyebrows however - it took place nine years after Platini had stopped working for Fifa, and was made while Blatter was seeking support for a fourth term as president and facing a major challenge from Qatar\u2019s Mohamed Bin Hammam. The payment was made less than a month after a meeting between Platini and Bin Hammam where it is understood they discussed the presidency. Two months later, Platini and UEFA\u2019s executive committee endorsed Blatter\u2019s candidacy. Blatter and Platini say the payment was completely unconnected with the presidential elections. Platini has said he had not been paid the full amount agreed in 1998 because of Fifa\u2019s financial situation at the time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
