A fiercely independent talent, in every sense, he's been a fixture of US cinema for decades now and has quietly and consistently stuck to his guns. This collection delivers his first three features, starting with the picaresque Permanent Vacaction, made shortly after he ditched film school. The technique is crude but Jarmusch's hand is evident throughout. Things improve drastically with Stranger Than Paradise, the film that first brought him to international attention. Low-key and smoulderingly funny, it finds tension in tedium and humour in boredom. No matter how bleak the setting, Jarmusch's characters never really excessively suffer or complain. In fact, they seem to have fun. The disc includes 15 minutes of silent behind-the-scenes footage shot on Super-8, making it the most lo-fi, uninformative DVD extra ever, which is totally appropriate. Down By Law confirms him as a master of his craft, with Tom Waits, John Lurie and Roberto Benigni teaming up for a very odd prison break - which is barely shown. This film would be the highpoint of most directors' careers; Jarmusch went on to top it with Dead Man, Mystery Train, Ghost Dog and others. Also out Eyes Without A Face Classy and gory 1960s French horror, in which a scalpel-happy doctor seeks the skin of young ladies for his experiments. \u00b7 \u00a318.99, Second Sight Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story John C Reilly does a sterling job (and sings rather well) in this agreeably silly Walk The Line musical biopic spoof. \u00b7 \u00a314.99, Sony A Man Escaped/Lancelot Du Lac/The Devil, Probably Three distilled dramas by celebrated French director Robert Bresson. \u00b7 \u00a318.99 each, Artificial Eye The Indiana Jones Trilogy Brush up on your Indianology before Harrison Ford's big return. \u00b7 \u00a329.50, Paramount"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
