As the dust settles on the furore caused by his resignation three weeks ago, those left behind in the FA's headquarters have come to the opinion that Crozier's vision was an expensive one that is threatening to bankrupt English football's governing body. The essential problem facing the FA is that it is committed to a number of costly, high-profile projects and has huge running costs. There is serious concern over whether it has the money to continue operating as it has since Crozier took over more than two years ago. The FA's yearly running costs stand at \u00a393m, most of this down to a wage bill of almost \u00a318m and the huge expense involved in moving to and renting the Soho offices. Just four years ago, when the FA was located in Lancaster Gate in west London, its running costs were \u00a343m while the wage bill was \u00a36.6m. The number of staff employed by the FA has also increased by more than a third to over 200, and there is widespread anger within the Premier League at what it claims is an over-staffed communications department assembled by Crozier at huge cost. Under Crozier, the FA also acquired a more fashionable image that involved hosting expensive parties and funding a large amount of first class foreign travel for officials in an attempt to improve the organisation's international standing. The running costs combined with Crozier's commitment to costly projects has left the FA facing a perilous financial situation. It has more money than ever in its coffers thanks to a \u00a3400m television deal with BSkyB and the BBC, and a commercial deal with five partner sponsors - currently four are committed - which, according to some estimates, could be worth as much as \u00a3200m. However, for those picking up the pieces of Crozier's legacy the crucial question is whether the FA has enough money to continue with its commitment to those projects he started. There is serious concern over how much the FA will earn from its next television deal given the current state of the market, while they have still to find a fifth commercial partner to join McDonald's, Nationwide, Umbro and Carlsberg. This has raised concerns that potential sponsors are not showing any interest and that the scheme might not earn anywhere near its \u00a3200m estimate. The biggest financial burden is Wembley. Less than a year ago Crozier claimed the development of a new national stadium would not cost the FA anything as he went to the government in search of funds. However, following concerns raised by the City and politicians, the FA has had to commit \u00a3100m of its own money up front plus another \u00a348m, still outstanding. The FA board is concerned over whether it will be able to meet the interest on any Wembley loans given that the stadium will have to generate \u00a340m per year in revenue and that its commercial success rests on the sale of 18,500 premium seats, expected to be the world's most expensive way to watch live sport. The first casualty of the FA's cutbacks could be the new National Football Centre in Burton-on-Trent, which is expected to cost between \u00a350m and \u00a360m. So far, the FA has spent \u00a320m on initial work and buying the site, and while there is general support for it from within the game, questions are being asked as to whether the FA has enough future income to pay for it. Crozier also had a cyberspace vision for the FA and was responsible for two costly internet projects that could face the axe. The first, costing \u00a33.5m, is designed to link up all county associations while another, costing \u00a312m, aims to link up all footballers and clubs in the country from professional to amateur level. The FA's executive team has to present its budget for 2003-2004 to the board in three weeks and has already started to plan savings, such as possible job cuts and trimming running costs as they attempt to save the organisation from the impact of Crozier's costly vision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
