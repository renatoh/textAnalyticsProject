Witnesses said people screamed in panic and some were thrown into the air by the car as it crashed through the shopping zone. Shortly before 2pm on Tuesday a 51-year-old man turned his silver-grey SUV on to the pedestrianised Brotstrasse shopping area, police said, where he \u201chit and ran over people at random\u201d. Public prosecutor Peter Fritzen later told reporters the driver had drunk a significant amount of alcohol and there was no sign of a religious or political motive. In a short press conference at the scene, police said the driver had been arrested and his vehicle seized. \u201cThe car was stopped by us on Christophstrasse,\u201d said a police spokesperson. \u201cInside the car was a 51-year-old German citizen from the Trier-Saarburg administrative district, who was arrested.\u201d News outlet Der Spiegel named the driver as \u201cBernd W\u201d. Brotstrasse and Simeonstrasse, a 1km-long, straight street lined with shops and cafes that lead up to the Porta Nigra, the largest Roman city gate north of the Alps, remained sealed off on Tuesday afternoon as police searched for evidence. Schools in the city were informed of the incident at about 2pm local time (1300 GMT) and parents were told to pick up their children rather than let them walk home on their own. Malu Dreyer, the premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate where Trier is located, said she was shocked that a baby was among those killed by the driver\u2019s \u201cbrutal act\u201d. \u201cThis is a terrible day,\u201d she said, adding that her thoughts and prayers were with the child\u2019s parents and all the other victims. Germany has tightened security on pedestrian zones across the country since a truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12 people and injured dozens. \u201cWhat happened in Trier is shocking. Our thoughts are with the relatives of the victims, with the numerous injured and with everyone who is currently on duty to care for the victims,\u201d wrote Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert on Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
