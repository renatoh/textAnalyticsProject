The New Hampshire senator, Kelly Ayotte told CBS's Face the Nation that the proposal, under which a path to citizenship would be provided for millions of undocumented immigrants, were \"tough but fair\". Meanwhile Rand Paul, a conservative Republican whose support is being courted in an attempt to forge a wide consensus, suggested that he was also open to voting in favour of the measures. But he told Fox News Sunday that he would want to see a tougher line on border security before giving his backing. \"I'm really trying to make immigration work, but they are going to have to come to me and they're going to have to make the bill stronger if they want me to vote for it,\" Paul added. The comments come as the draft immigration bill \u2013 the result of lengthy negotiations amongst a bipartisan group of eight senators \u2013 prepares to go to Congress. Proposals have already been given support by the White House, along with the main union and business organisation in the US. But its passage through Congress is uncertain. Although it is expected to get widespread support in the Democrat-led Senate, it will need several Republican backers to get past the 60-vote mark needed for passage. It will face a tougher audience in the Republican majority House, with many conservatives expressing concern over the proposals, suggesting that it amounts to an amnesty for those in the country illegally. Paul suggested Sunday that he could be the conduit between Republicans in the House and moderates in the Senate. At its core, the proposals will see around 11 million undocumented immigrants put on a 13-year path to citizenship. They will also set border security goals for the government. The bill is set to be debated in the Senate later this month. In his weekly address, Obama preempted criticism of the immigration blueprint, stating that opponents \"are going to do everything they can\" to block \"common sense\" reform. \"The bill before the Senate isn't perfect, it's a compromise. Nobody will get everything they want, not Democrats, not Republicans, not me,\" he said. But the president added that the bill represented the best opportunity to \"finally fix an immigration system that is badly broken.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
