The committee suggested that the British government's attitude towards Afghanistan was one of simply hoping for the best, since it would have little influence over the country's future. Former British ambassadors to Afghanistan told the committee that Nato's understanding of the Taliban was limited, that \"corruption and abuse of power was intrinsic in Afghan society\" and that the country's economy depended heavily on the drugs trade. The MPs warned that the start of an Afghan-led peace settlement with the Taliban was vital to ensure the country's stability and security after the withdrawal of British troops next year. But they added that coalition forces' lack of progress in reducing violence in the country \"does not augur well for improving security and economic development on a long-term sustainable basis\". The committee also criticised the government for failing to combat the perception that the pullout amounted to \"withdrawal through fatigue\". Publication of the report came a day after the government announced that the last group of Royal Marines to be deployed in Afghanistan was returning to the UK. Troops from 40 Commando Royal Marines were based in the Nahr-e Saraj district. The 7,200-strong Royal Marine Corps has deployed commandos to Afghanistan 12 times since 2001, and 40 Commando were the first British troops in the country that year, securing Bagram airfield and patrolling the streets of Kabul. The defence committee said that the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office took an optimistic view of the future yet gave very little information about how they planned to be involved in Afghanistan beyond 2014, James Arbuthnot, chairman of the committee, said: \"We have received starkly opposing predictions for Afghanistan's outlook, post-2014. The fact is that the UK has limited influence.\" The report concluded: \"We hope that Afghanistan can become a secure, prosperous and flourishing country but we are concerned that Afghanistan could descend into civil war within a few years.\" Some ground may have to be given in negotiations with the Taliban but the committee stressed the importance of open and free elections and said the rule of law and human rights should not be compromised in any settlement. The committee said that all Afghan people, including women, must be involved in the peace process. If women were excluded as a consequence of negotiating with the Taliban, the progress made could easily unravel, the MPs warned. \"If the UK is to continue to provide financial and training support to Afghanistan post-2014, there needs to be a clear articulation of the areas the UK will fund and support and the outcomes it expects to achieve\", the report said. \"It must be clear to those engaged in the peace negotiations that, in providing support in the future, the UK will be paying close attention to the progress on the rights of women, children and minority groups, the tackling of corruption and the furtherance of the rule of law\". The report also claimed that not enough was being done to train and equip Afghan security forces properly. Concerns remained over the capability of Afghan forces to fill the gap left by withdrawing coalition forces, particularly in terms of helicopters, close air support and logistics, the committee said. \"We are concerned that the ANSF [Afghan national security forces totalling about 350,000] will reduce its strength by over a third on current plans based on the expectation that the insurgency will have been diminished,\" the report added. \"The government should urge the international community to develop a contingency plan in case the level of the insurgency does not diminish\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
