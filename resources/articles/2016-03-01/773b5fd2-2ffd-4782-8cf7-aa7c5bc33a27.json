I am dizzy and annoyed and I want those three hours of my life back. Did we really have to go through all that to get to the resolution we had known was coming from the first moment? And not a sniff of the best character in the entire last episode. Where, for the love of Lovejoy, was the pug? \u201cFrank and Mary\u2019s happiness hangs by a thread, as Louis Scatcherd prepares to seize the Greshamsbury estate,\u201d read the blurb for this last outing. And by golly did we have a lot of pointless and easily guessed plot to get through. Plinky-plonky waltz music topped and tailed this series finale as an orchestra went wild 99% of the time, diluting much of the dialogue. At every turn, the emotional response was dictated by the score, signalling what we should be feeling when. And all because there was no room for the actors to control that response themselves \u2013 which is wrong, all wrong. I hate to say anything against the actors who must do battle with Uncle Julian\u2019s scripts. But, really. They all looked so bored here. At least we had Louis\u2019 shenanigans to distract us. And, quelle surprise! Louis hasn\u2019t stopped drinking. Indeed, now he has a snifter surgically attached to his hand, which he carries from household to household. I liked it when Louis ate the bread. But apart from that, these scenes were excruciating. Partly because they were meant to be so, but partly because there was nothing surprising or delightful or genuinely menacing. It was all just Louis being a boor. Where was the sense of the family\u2019s future at stake? But what\u2019s this? Oh no! Louis\u2019 birthday is approaching and he is getting litigious! \u201cAh, my boy, you arrive at a melancholy hour!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in love with my niece!\u201d \u201cAnd now the chance to render his rival penniless and landless is compelling!\u201d It was the battle of the exclamation marks. Honestly, why is everyone so far behind? I can\u2019t believe that Doctor Thorne wouldn\u2019t have worked all this out a lot sooner. On and on it went, until Louis had the inevitable drunken misadventure we had been waiting for. \u201cHis lung was punctured in the fall. His struggle will soon be over.\u201d In real life, of course, his own mother would have pushed him into the fireplace ages ago. At least the ketchup-fest was fairly entertaining. And the sudden death. And what\u2019s this? Mary is actually the heir to the fortune! And they still have her baby trousseau! Huzzah! (Lady Scatcherd\u2019s blanket has lasted well, I must say. Top marks for knitting. Zero marks for producing decent offspring.) Cue more dramatic music! Watch out, Frank! Don\u2019t commit suicide until you\u2019ve found out the good news! (Now that would have been a good story. Apologies to Shakespeare.) \u201cWe\u2019ll take a new look at things tomorrow.\u201d What? Are you mad, Doctor Thorne? Tell her now that she\u2019s rich so she can go and tell Frank, for goodness sake. \u201cHer fortune is approaching half a million pounds!\u201d Yay! Cue soaring violins and a dissolve into the wedding breakfast. \u201cHere\u2019s a happy ending for you. Any number of happy endings.\u201d I thought I needed a lie-down (by which I mean \u201cfull medical sedation\u201d) after Downton. But after this I need some kind of horse tranquiliser. Or a memory drug to forget it ever happened. Corset corner Some quality simpering went on here. But there was little much else for the ladies to do. And there are no flowers left now in the south of England, as they have all been picked for use in this programme. Augusta\u2019s daffodils were fresher than ever. The secret smiles between she and Mr Gazeby were most excellent. As was this line: \u201cWe shall have to talk in a dumb show if you keep this up.\u201d Brilliant, blink-centric response from Alexandrina to Augusta\u2019s proposal: \u201cWha-a-a-aaaa-aat?\u201d I thought there was more to Alexandrina\u2019s disdain than met the eye. Meanwhile the Countess de Courcy won the bonnet prize with flowers on the outside and the inside. And Miss Dunstable was back, flirting with our eponymous hero as she always should have been. Just what the doctor ordered. The Rebecca Front fan club The queen of the disapproving countenance rides again. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d \u201cTolerably well, thank you.\u201d Feel the ice behind the response to Louis\u2019 request to guess how much his father bought his house for! \u201cI never guess.\u201d Witness the sickness on the face as she held back the bile: \u201cYou know how fond we are of you \u2026 Only you can give him back what his life might have been. By withdrawing from the field.\u201d All just an appetiser for the main course, though: the epitome of smugness at the news that Mary had thrown Frank over. And then the screaming and the smashing of glass. But why didn\u2019t we get to see it? Why put the best emotional response in the whole thing behind closed doors? So unfair. I do wish we could have seen some rending of garments and rolling around in the dust. But it was all so understated and rushed in the end. The fan club demands a director\u2019s cut, focused entirely on Lady Arabella\u2019s reactions. Pug watch Where was the pug? Augusta was forced to play the role of the pug here, as Lady Arabella\u2019s canine companion was mysteriously absent. Augusta turned pug very nicely, especially in the final scene, where Alexandrina had been awarded Best in Show. More pug consistency next time, ITV. What self-respecting costume drama promises primetime puggery, then pulls it away at the last moment? Disgraceful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
