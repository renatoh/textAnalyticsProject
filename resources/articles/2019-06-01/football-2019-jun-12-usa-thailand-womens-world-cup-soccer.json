Here are the big takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s resounding win. We still don\u2019t know if the American defense is good enough to win the World Cup Thailand were never going to test the USWNT\u2019s defense, and lingering concerns about the American backline have certainly not been absolved by Tuesday\u2019s rout. If anything, the Americans played on Tuesday like they knew they wouldn\u2019t be tested in the back. They started the match with seven attackers pushing toward goal and just three defenders at the back. Becky Sauerbrunn was officially left out because of a quad issue, but she may have actually been rested to conserve the minutes of the oldest and arguably most important defender on the team. The fact still remains: in the five matches USWNT have played against teams ranked in the top 10 this year, they have conceded multiple goals in all but one of those games. Thailand, ranked 34th in the world, are not reflective of the competition the US will face in the later rounds. Everyone already knew the US have an incredibly potent attack and a shaky defense. That viewpoint hasn\u2019t changed after the Thailand game. The scoreline shows there is work to be done around the world While there was certainly much hand-wringing over the Americans pummeling their opponent and celebrating every step of the way, the lopsided 13-0 score reflects a larger issue. The Thailand women\u2019s team just isn\u2019t supported financially in the way the US women\u2019s team is, and that\u2019s true of plenty of teams at this World Cup. There are haves and haves-not throughout women\u2019s football, particularly because federations prefer to divert funding to their men\u2019s programs. Megan Rapinoe said it is well-within Fifa\u2019s power to remedy the situation. \u201cThere are some teams here that have only played a handful of games since the last World Cup or only in the qualifiers,\u201d said Rapinoe, who was one of the US goalscorers against Thailand. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, not only for the federations but for Fifa. Just mandate it \u2013 they mandate all kinds of things.\u201d These types of scores, while unusual, are more common in the women\u2019s World Cup than the men\u2019s version. Germany beat Ivory Coast 10-0 in 2015, and put 11 past Argentina in 2007. The US said they there was no malice in their victory. The players insisted it was just business as the World Cup includes a tiebreaker based on goal difference. Alex Morgan could be seen comforting American-born Thai striker Miranda Nild after the game, telling her to keep her head up. \u201cI told her it\u2019s a dream of all of ours to play in a World Cup and \u2026 she has two more games to showcase herself \u2013 she\u2019s a quality player \u2013 and to stay encouraged,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cShe\u2019s living out a dream that most women and girls don\u2019t get to.\u201d The rest of the competition better watch out The USA were already considered tournament favorites alongside hosts France, but Tuesday\u2019s win was a clear statement of intent. The USA players had been asked all week about France\u2019s impressive 4-0 win over South Korea in the tournament opener. Now, the US have turned in a performance that France may be asked about as well. \u201cWe had to wait so long to play, so we were chomping at the bit,\u201d Kelley O\u2019Hara said. \u201cWe wanted to come out here and make a good first impression.\u201d The Americans now have not only a strong performance under their belt, but some of the team\u2019s key members, such as playmaker Rose Lavelle, goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher and center-back Abby Dahlkemper, have been eased into the World Cup with reason to feel good about what comes next. \u201cThis game is a huge confidence builder, especially for those who had never played in a World Cup before,\u201d said Julie Ertz. \u201cWe had a few of those girls score tonight. That builds confidence but I hope they\u2019re also happy with their performances on top of their goals because they did well.\u201d Criticism of the US celebrations is not new This is not the first time the Americans have been lambasted for running up a score against a weaker opponent and celebrating furiously along the way. In the 2012 Olympics qualifying campaign, the Americans steamrolled their opponents, including a 14-0 win over the Dominican Republic. Then-coach Pia Sundhage celebrated each goal by leaping off the bench or cheering, and the local broadcasters in Canada criticized Sundhage live on air for lacking class. When the 2012 Olympics in London arrived, the Americans doubled down. The players unveiled planned and choreographed celebrations, like group cartwheels in a 2-0 win over New Zealand and a hip-hop dance in a 1-0 win over North Korea. After New Zealand\u2019s coach complained, Sundhage responded: \u201cWe score goals and you\u2019re happy. What the players want to do, whatever they do, it has to be fun.\u201d The Americans went on to to win the gold medal. This time around, coach Jill Ellis also defended her players, who did not have choreographed dances but did celebrate each goal enthusiastically. \u201cFor four years they have been working, and some of them longer if it\u2019s their first World Cup,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAs a coach, I don\u2019t find it my job to harness my players. This is what they\u2019ve dreamt of. This is it for them. This is a world championship.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
