Gay grabbed at his left hamstring and fell to the track after running only 12 strides. 'It appears to be a severe cramp,' Mark Wetmore, Gay's agent, said. With places awarded strictly according to the finishing order in the trials, there is no way back for Gay in this event, although he will be among the favourites for the 100m in Beijing, after winning that event last Sunday. He is also world champion in the shorter sprint. The United States also lost 1996 Olympic 110-metres hurdles champion Allen Johnson to injury on a costly day. The 37-year-old Johnson cleared only four hurdles in the opening round before succumbing to a season-ending tendon injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
