Now entering their third week of occupying the Malheur national wildlife refuge in rural Harney County, leaders of the militia appear to be testing the patience of the local sheriff\u2019s department and the FBI by brazenly commandeering and in some cases destroying public property while escalating their anti-government rhetoric. Community leaders and government officials in Oregon and beyond say they fear there could be major damage at the refuge and elevated safety risks for employees and local residents if the militia continues to stand its ground, seemingly emboldened by the continuing lack of consequences. \u201cFor these people to go in and just be destructive, they\u2019re really trying to get a rise out of somebody,\u201d said Charlotte Rodrique, chairwoman of the local Paiute Indian tribe, who has argued that Native Americans have much more of a claim to the public land in question than the out-of-state militiamen running the takeover. \u201cThey really want a confrontation.\u201d On Friday evening, Rodrique said she was horrified to learn that the militia, led by Nevada rancher Ammon Bundy, had paved a road through part of the wildlife sanctuary. That move came days after occupiers destroyed part of a US Fish and Wildlife Service fence, to allow cattle to freely graze on public lands the federal government controls. Militiamen have also removed cameras at the refuge they claim the FBI was using for \u201csurveillance\u201d. LaVoy Finicum, an Arizona rancher and one of the main spokesmen for the militia, showed up to a Saturday morning press conference carrying a basket filled with black cameras. \u201cDo you not get tired of the mass surveillance in this country?\u201d Finicum told reporters. \u201cThis, in my opinion, is unreasonable search.\u201d He added: \u201cI want to call out the FBI and their harassment of neighborhood families.\u201d Finicum and other militiamen seemed undeterred by the Oregon state police\u2019s arrest on Friday of occupier Kenneth Medenbach, 62, who drove a government vehicle off the refuge to the local Safeway supermarket in the town of Burns, 30 miles away. \u201cSometimes we make dumb choices,\u201d Finicum said of the arrest. When driving their own vehicles, however, high-profile militia leaders have had no difficulty entering and leaving the compound. In fact, Finicum and Ryan Bundy, Ammon\u2019s brother, recently left the refuge and drove out of Oregon and were then able to return to the occupation without facing any contact with law enforcement, Finicum told the Guardian. Finicum said he and Ryan Bundy met out-of-state ranchers interested in mounting a similar protest against the federal government, but declined to say where the meeting took place. During his short trip, he said, he felt confident that law enforcement would not approach or arrest them. \u201cWe did watch our mirrors a lot,\u201d he said. In addition to his criticisms of the federal government, Finicum slammed Harney County officials for denying the militia access to a community building in Burns, where the occupiers want to present their plans to local residents. Members of a so-called Harney County Committee of Safety, who have worked with Bundy and say they want to take over his cause, are threatening to file a complaint against the county for refusing to allow the militia to use its buildings. Regarding the wildlife refuge, the Burns Pauite Indian tribe and federal government officials said they were worried about possible damage to cultural resources, artifacts, sensitive records and local wildlife habitats. The US Fish and Wildlife Service strongly condemned the occupiers for building the new road. \u201cIt\u2019s deplorable,\u201d spokesman Jason Holm said in an email. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what part of the [occupiers\u2019] interpretation of the constitution promotes the destruction and desecration of culturally significant Native American sites \u2026 This is disgusting, ghoulish behavior.\u201d Holm also said the fish and wildlife service had received reports that the occupiers were accessing federal records at the refuge, raising concerns about a possibly dangerous data breach. He said the government was now contracting with a data protection and credit monitoring service to safeguard refuge employees whose personal data may have been compromised. Rodrique said that when refuge officials undertake projects that disrupt the land, they consult the tribe\u2019s leaders and archaeologists to ensure that there is no damage to burial sites or potential artifacts. \u201cThere is so much history in that area,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a point where everyone is cooperating and working together to preserve archaeological historical sites.\u201d If the militiamen damage or steal tribal artifacts or confidential documents related to Native American history, Rodrique said, she hoped federal officials would prosecute the men to the fullest extent of the law. Asked about the tribe\u2019s concerns, Finicum said Native Americans should be working with the militia. \u201cWe\u2019re here for the natives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe federal government has been their biggest oppressor.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
