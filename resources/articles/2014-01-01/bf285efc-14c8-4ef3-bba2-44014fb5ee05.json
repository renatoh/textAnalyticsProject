In Georgia and Alabama, some children faced the prospect of spending the night at their schools because parents were unable to pick them up. Outlying parishes in usually mild New Orleans were preparing for three inches of snow and utility officials in Mississippi warned of widespread power outages as the storm moved to the east. In parts of northern Florida, where temperatures plunged more than 30F below average, government offices, courts and schools were closed until at least Thursday, giving workers and students unexpected \u201csnow days\u201d. \u201cThe storm is bringing a long swath of freezing rain, sleet and snow from south-east Texas to the Gulf coast, Georgia, the Carolinas and south-east Virginia,\u201d said meteorologist Chris Dolce of weather.com. \u201cNo matter what type of precipitation falls in any given location, travel conditions are likely to be dangerous into Wednesday. Part of south-east Georgia and coastal South Carolina are of particular concern for significant amounts of freezing rain, which could cause tree damage and power outages.\u201d Two people were reported killed and others critically injured in a seven-vehicle crash on a frozen bridge in Wetumpka, Alabama. Four others died in a mobile home fire in Mississippi blamed on a malfunctioning heater. Troopers in both states closed hundreds of roads and Alabama governor Robert Bentley declared a civil emergency, sending more than 350 National Guard troops to the south of the state. Officials in Atlanta, Georgia, reported that every interstate in the city was gridlocked even before the evening rush hour began. \u201cWe are doing all we can to maintain mobility on literally hundreds of highways. That effort is complicated in some areas by the heavy traffic of individuals trying to get home,\u201d said Natalie Dale, spokeswoman for the Georgia department of transportation. \u201cAs people get home from work, we ask them to stay there and not drive again unless necessitated by an emergency.\u201d Georgia\u2019s Cherokee County was one of several in which education officials promised to keep schools open overnight for students who could not be picked up. \u201cSchools will be in direct communication with parents of students still in their care and are prepared to shelter students as necessary this evening,\u201d schools superintendent Frank Petruzielo said. Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal also announced a state of emergency. New Orleans\u2019 Louis Armstrong airport and the busy Lake Pontchartrain causeway bridges were closed and power companies brought in 2,000 extra workers to deal with lines downed during the storm. The governors of North and South Carolina also issued emergency declarations. Meteorologists said that the storm, the second deep freeze to sweep across the US midwest and states to the east this month, was driven on a path similar to the one taken by the polar vortex that brought cold temperatures to much of the US earlier this year. Unusually powerful ice storms in the Arctic push frigid air further south than usual, resulting in record low temperatures across large swaths of the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
