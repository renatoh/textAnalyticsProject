The Czech FA announced late on Friday night \u2013 after the team defeated Slovakia 3-1 \u2013 that the fixture was cancelled. The first the Scottish FA heard about this was via social media. Uefa subsequently insisted the game in Olomouc must take place. European football\u2019s governing body has released rules that state international games should be played if a team can call upon 13 players, one of whom must be a goalkeeper. The Czechs now say their \u201cteam will consist [of] new players and staff members\u201d, with numerous clubs reluctant to let their players join the setup. The West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek and the Roma striker Patrik Schick are self-isolating after coming into contact with a backroom staff member who tested positive for Covid-19. The Czechs delayed their departure for Slovakia by 24 hours while the entire squad was retested and the players made the 200-mile journey by road after splitting up into small groups. \u201cWe are in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d said Clarke, \u201cand you just have to react to certain situations. It would be unfair to go any further than that.\u201d When asked whether any clubs had asked that their players do not travel to the Czech Republic, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Ian Maxwell, the Scottish FA\u2019s chief executive, subsequently admitted: \u201cObviously clubs are concerned.\u201d Clarke gave the impression he was not altogether happy with the curious buildup but insisted his players have not lost focus. Scotland toiled for long spells of Friday\u2019s 1-1 draw with Israel, a rehearsal for next month\u2019s Euro 2020 play-off semi-final. \u201cThe game is going ahead, nothing has changed for us,\u201d Clarke said of the match in Olomouc. \u201cThe [postponement] announcement didn\u2019t affect us in any way whatsoever. We just told the players they had to prepare for the game as normal. If Uefa hadn\u2019t called off the game, it was going ahead. There was never any doubt in our minds that the game would go ahead. What squad the Czech Republic would have, we couldn\u2019t influence. \u201cWe have top people looking after us and we are following all the protocols. We have had assurances from Uefa and the Czech Republic that the new boys coming into the squad and the staff will be tested properly. Everything will be done properly and we are going there in a bubble, we don\u2019t need to come across anybody. I have had four Covid tests in the last 12 days. We are good to go and we have to take at face value that everything is good on the other side.\u201d Clarke and his players are due to fly to the Czech Republic on Sunday evening. In a statement issued on Saturday, Maxwell said: \u201cWe were as surprised as Uefa to learn of the statement posted on the official FACR channels. Following extensive conversations late last night and this morning we have received categorical assurance that the match goes ahead. \u201cCzech Republic have confirmed they will be able to fulfil their obligations to the match and, more importantly, to the stringent Covid-19 testing regime that is sacrosanct to ensure the safety of our players and staff. \u201cWhile we empathise with all national associations during this period of global uncertainty, nonetheless we required and received absolute assurance that we will be entering a safe and secure environment having worked diligently in Scotland to maintain safety and adherence to Uefa\u2019s necessary Covid-19 protocols.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
