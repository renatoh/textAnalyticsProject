In a speech to the Unite Against Racism conference at Stamford Bridge today, Bates outlined the huge strides that have been made in English football but said more needed to be done across Europe. Bates said: \"When I took over as Chelsea chairman 20 years ago this club had one of the worst reputations for racism in English football. \"It was a rallying point for our local fascists - the National Front. We had never had a black player in our history and violence associated with racism was prevalent. \"I remember when we picked the first black player, Paul Canoville. In his first match at Crystal Palace he was warming up when he had a banana thrown at him. \"In his first home game I escorted him off the pitch and for my pains got some hate mail, including razor blades sent through the post. I would have lost the tips of my fingers if I had opened the letter the wrong way. \"The National Front used to meet before the match in the pub across the road and wait for the team-sheet - if there were black players in the team they would stay in the pub drinking all afternoon.\" Bates said he took \"enormous pride\" from the changes that had been brought in to Chelsea. He added: \"We have achieved a great deal but not as much as we would have liked to do. Now we have black players but more importantly black, Asian and Chinese season ticket holders. \"I am delighted by that as it means they are comfortable here and feel safe and part of the family.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
