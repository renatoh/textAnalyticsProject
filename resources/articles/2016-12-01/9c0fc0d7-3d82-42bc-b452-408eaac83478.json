Bilic acknowledged his side\u2019s continuing struggle for goals before their visit to free-scoring Liverpool on Sunday. West Ham have scored 15 times in 14 Premier League games this season and only two of those goals have come from strikers. Andy Carroll and Diafra Sakho have one apiece, Carroll\u2019s goal the consolation in last Saturday\u2019s 5-1 thrashing by Arsenal, but each of the three forwards signed in the summer \u2013 Jonathan Calleri, Ashley Fletcher and Simone Zaza \u2013 has yet to score in the league. \u201cThe strikers didn\u2019t score enough goals or as many as we expected but it is not only down to them,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cI never want to divide the team into strikers and the rest. Although it is the strikers\u2019 job to score goals, it is also the responsibility of the whole team.\u201d When asked about Sturridge, who is currently out for an unspecified time with a calf injury and will not feature at Anfield, Bilic said: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the biggest talents, he\u2019s a great player. The talent is there, the touch, the finishing, everything is great. The only thing that\u2019s stopped him being regular for club and country are the injuries. \u201cHe\u2019s just a player that has been linked with us, basically, and we\u2019ve been linked with almost every player,\u201d Bilic added. \u201cWe\u2019re always there in contention. Most of the time it\u2019s absolutely not true, 95% of the time. But you\u2019re asking me about Sturridge and I have no problem about that. All the clubs are thinking about him because he is that kind of player. I don\u2019t know his work rate, I don\u2019t know his dedication to his job or whatever but unfortunately for England and for Liverpool and especially for him he\u2019s injured. That\u2019s his problem.\u201d West Ham\u2019s top scorer Michail Antonio, who has six goals to his name, is expected to return from injury on Sunday, alongside full-back Aaron Cresswell. Carroll will also continue his return to match fitness, with Bilic keen to have the striker back given West Ham face three games in eight days. \u201cIt\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot in the past few days,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cThe last game he played before Arsenal was in Romania at the beginning of the season. That\u2019s a long break and we have three games and need him in all three of them. He can\u2019t be that ready and we can\u2019t be naive enough to expect that he is. It would be crazy to think he could last three 90 minutes in one week. But we are going to use him probably, or most definitely, in all three because we need him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
