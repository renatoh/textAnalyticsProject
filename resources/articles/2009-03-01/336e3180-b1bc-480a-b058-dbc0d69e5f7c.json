The captain, Steven Gerrard, who had a cousin among the 96 fans who died as a result of the crush at the Leppings Lane end of the ground before an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, has added his voice to those who have called on Uefa to ensure that there is no clash with the anniversary of the tragedy. The club has exchanged a series of letters with the European governing body but has received no guarantees. However, it is understood that when the draw has been made, Liverpool's desire not to play on Wednesday 15th will be fed into Uefa's fixture computer and it is \"extremely unlikely\" they will be forced to do so. The clash with the anniversary will be treated the same way as other factors that prevent certain teams playing on specific nights. In the past these have included practical concerns such as stadium clashes, for example if Internazionale and Milan were both drawn to play at home or if it were recommended that Chelsea and Arsenal should not play at home on the same night on police advice. Uefa sources said last night that Platini was unwilling to give a guarantee ahead of the draw for fear of setting a precedent. In the past Uefa has received requests for matches to be moved because they coincide with significant anniversaries or for religious reasons. It argued that the organisation schedules more than 1,600 matches a year and that it was important to ensure there could be no perception that the draw was in any way being fixed. But once it has been made, barring a series of unforeseen scheduling problems that would make it impossible, it will ensure Liverpool play their opening tie on Wednesday 8 April and the return leg on Tuesday 14 April. Platini said yesterday that Uefa would \"do our utmost\" to prevent the tie having to go ahead on 15 April. \"We are aware of the huge significance of the April 15 date for both Liverpool FC and their fans, and that is why we will do our utmost to make sure that the club does not have to play its Uefa Champions League second leg quarter-final match on that day,\" said Platini. \"I have been in regular correspondence with Liverpool on this matter for some time now and fully sympathise with the club's feelings as to the importance of respecting the date for those who lost their lives at Hillsborough. This being the 20th anniversary of that tragic disaster in 1989 makes it even more relevant and we will take this into account.\" It is believed that the culture secretary Andy Burnham is among those who is sympathetic to Liverpool's stance. \"We hope that Uefa show some common sense,\" said Gerrard, who will lead Liverpool players and officials at a memorial service scheduled in the city for 15 April. \"You would think they would accept the significance of the date for the people of Liverpool but unfortunately feelings like that don't always come into it,\" he said on Sunday. \"Hillsborough is always on my mind because I lost a member of my family there and any success we get as a club this year will be dedicated to those people who lost their lives.\" The FA is planning to host representatives of the victim's families at Wembley on 18 April, when Chelsea play Arsenal or Hull City in the first FA Cup semi-final. The FA chairman, Lord Triesman, will present relatives of the victims with flowers before the game. There will also be one minute of applause as a mark of respect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
