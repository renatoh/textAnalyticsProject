The late managers are East End royalty, having been responsible for the only meaningful trophies West Ham have won in their 115-year history. That was recognised last year when the main gates to Upton Park were renamed in Lyall's honour and a Greenwood and Lyall Lounge was opened. Both families had received complimentary directors' box tickets but, following the takeover by David Sullivan and David Gold - who have made great play of their credentials as West Ham fans \u2013 last season, that privilege was downgraded to a pair of season tickets. The families only learned that these too had been taken away when calling the club in early August to ask what the arrangements would be for the new season. \"I fully appreciate the financial plight of the club and can understand the reasoning why the season tickets have been withdrawn,\" said Lyall's son, Murray. \"But what I do find unacceptable is that no one in authority had the decency to contact us and explain in person.\" Lyall's widow, Yvonne, added: \"After my husband's 34 years' loyal service to the club in a playing, coaching and managerial capacity, I feel my family should have been shown greater respect and understanding given our tragic loss four years ago and the legacy he left behind.\" It has \"appalled\" Amanda Jacks, a lifelong Hammers fan, who said: \"West Ham trade as a family club but no supporter would treat their family this way. The strength of feeling from the West Ham support will only demonstrate what an ill-considered decision this is.\" Portsmouth's paperwork The transfer of Portsmouth's Football League share to a company said to be controlled by Balram Chainrai was not rubber-stamped by the League's board yesterday. And so the club remain in administration, which is not the outcome anyone would have expected when the administrator, Andrew Andronikou, was talking about \"blue sky ahead\" and how the club would soon be \"out of the clutches of the Football League\". It is believed there was insufficient paperwork for the League to ratify the club's takeover by PFC Realisations. If so, it would not be the first time Pompey have had a problem with their paperwork this week, with Liam Lawrence's loan from Stoke City to Fratton Park also held up over late filing of documents. \"From our end, all documentation was sent on time, well before the 6pm deadline,\" Andronikou said. \"I was there myself to see it.\" According to what Digger has heard, from the League's end it did not arrive until after 8pm. Who to believe? Friends in high places Aston Villa fans may be underwhelmed by the arrival of G\u00e9rard Houllier in the Second City but his appointment can have done the club no harm in the eyes of Uefa. The former Liverpool manager has served as a technical assessor for the European football body and has a close relationship with its president, Michel Platini. Indeed, he was having dinner with Platini when the latter was taken ill at the World Cup in South Africa. Indeed it is believed he even accompanied Platini to hospital. With Platini widely expected to succeed Sepp Blatter as Fifa's president in a few years, it surely cannot hurt Villa to have friends in such high places. West Brom Kick It Out West Bromwich Albion supporters have teamed up with the anti-racism campaign Kick It Out to create banners hitting back at Lokomotiv Moscow fans who directed a banana jibe at the Nigeria international, Peter Odemwingie, when he left to join the Baggies. One has a picture of Odemwingie celebrating his winner against Sunderland last month with the words \"Thanks Lokomotiv\". The other, with pictures of Lawurie Cunningham, Cyrille Regis and Brendon Batson \u2013 the club famously broke new ground by fielding three such influential black players \u2013 as well as Odemwingie, states: \"The only colours here are blue and white.\" Redknapp court hearing Harry Redknapp faces a court hearing over alleged tax evasion within 24 hours of his club's home Champions League tie against Werder Bremen. A scheduled hearing involving lawyers for Redknapp, Peter Storrie and Milan Mandaric \u2013 who deny charges of tax evasion \u2013 was due at Southwark Crown Court next week but has been postponed after legal teams requested more time. It will now take place on Thursday 25 and Friday 26 November, meaning it begins the day after the Bundesliga side travel to White Hart Lane. Southwark Crown Court's diary clearly does not pay too much heed to Redknapp's football commitments. Next week's scheduled hearing would in any case have clashed with his club's trip to Werder Bremen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
