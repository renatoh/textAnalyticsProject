Navratilova and Kralik with a 'tennising' artwork. Photograph: Damien Pleming Where does one go after professional tennis? To selling pants, \u00e0 la Bj\u00f6rn Borg? To endorsing American Express, like Andre Agassi? Or perhaps to a more creative endeavour? Nine-times Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova, who retired from the professional circuit 18 months ago, has decided to pursue a career in art. Specifically, Navratilova is carving out a new career in \"tennising\", which is, as you might surmise, just like painting but with a tennis ball and racket in lieu of a brush: the ball dipped in paint and kapowed at the canvas. It was not the tennis star's own idea, but one put to her several years ago by the Slovak artist Juraj Kr\u00e1lik, who had found himself inspired by the marks left on clay courts by tennis balls after a match. Since then, the pair have created 300 such works in a variety of sizes and produced in a range of locations - Kr\u00e1lik creates the fake grass and clay backgrounds and decides where Navratilova should aim the balls; she obligingly thwacks them from 12 feet away. The results of Navratilova and Kr\u00e1lik's efforts hover tantalising between a Jackson Pollock, one of Damien Hirst's \"Spot\" series and the pointillism of Seurat, Signac and Cross. At other times, they resemble an advertisement for Smarties. In any case they are rather pleasing to behold: confetti-strewn tennis courts and crude black thumps mingled with turquoise sploshes. It is, of course, a messy business, but one that Navratilova has described as \"just the greatest fun\", and that has met with considerable praise from both art critics and the general public. The pair will soon unveil their first commercial exhibition in the UK, fortuitously staged during Wimbledon fortnight. Prices will range from \u00a31,500 to \u00a3126,000 - though, for those without that sort of cash available, there will be an affordable range of T-shirts on sale too. Navratilova's new career direction should not perhaps come as a tremendous surprise; in the early 90s she revealed a creative inclination when she began writing mystery novels set in the cut-throat world of tennis and offering a \"deadly combination of murder and tennis that will take you to break point\". She has also pursued photography and woodwork. \"I just love that sense of creating something with my own hands,\" she told this newspaper in 2003, shortly after having made two wooden tables. \"Now, I sure ain't gonna be as good a carpenter as I am a tennis player, but that doesn't mean it won't give me pleasure.\" \u00b7 See Navratilova and Kr\u00e1lik's tennis art here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
