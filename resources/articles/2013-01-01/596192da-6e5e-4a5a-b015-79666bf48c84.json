Bearing in mind that two of the best-known occupants of the Palace of Versailles ended up on the guillotine, I'd have thought that anyone might see it was tempting to fate to build a 30 bathroomed (no one seemed to know exactly how many other rooms it was due to have) replica just for themselves. Even in Florida. And having seen his own father lose most of his money in Las Vegas when he was a kid, I'd also have thought David would be aware, in that particular city, that the bank always wins. Hubris can be expensive. When Lauren Greenfield began work on Storyville: The Queen of Versailles (BBC4) she envisaged making a very different film: a story of excess, consumption and the American Dream taken to its limits by America's timeshare king. Then came the financial crash of 2008 and the documentary instantly turned many shades darker, as tumbleweed started to blow through both the unfinished palace and the Siegels' marriage. As a portrait of public and private decay, it was mesmerising. The brilliance of this film lay not just in its remarkable access to the Siegels' daily lives, but also in its delicate balance between the intimate and the objective. Never once did Greenfield pass judgment on the Siegels; she let them construct and drive their own tumbrils. David railed against the banks that were seeking to foreclose on the cheap money they had lent him for his Las Vegas tower; he never stopped to think he had been selling on the same cheap debt to timeshare buyers as sub-prime mortgages for properties they couldn't afford and probably didn't really want. \"The stress has made us a great deal closer,\" said Jacqueline, David's third wife, a pneumatic former Miss America. \"It's like having another child,\" said David. One of the most telling moments passed almost without notice, when Jacqueline discovered that one of the family's many pets had died some time in the past week because no one had bothered to give it any water. \"I didn't even know we had a lizard,\" said one of the eight children, wandering off to watch TV. If you could get past an understandable desire to see the Siegels get their comeuppance, then here was a shattering vision both of the corrosive power of money and emotional and physical neglect. By the end of the film, David had given up the unequal struggle with the banks in Las Vegas, but was still desperately trying to hang on to his crumbling Versailles empire. For the sake of his soul and his family, he might be better off embracing the revolution. We're still a month and a half away from Red Nose Day and it's already beginning to look as if the prime purpose of this year's Comic Relief is to provide the BBC with a steady stream of cookery programmes to fill the schedules. After last week's four Great British Bake Off celebrity specials, we now get Great British Menu (BBC2), in which various top chefs from around the UK \"battle\" to create a dish that will appear on the menu for a Comic Relief gala dinner. This being Comic Relief \u2013 see, I can do my bit to raise awareness for Red Nose day by dropping the charity's name into every sentence; please give generously \u2013 the emphasis for this menu is less on the British and more on the comic. So each dish has to reflect the chef's wacky sense of humour. The drawback is that for most of us food is really not inherently very funny, so watching one chef smile as he cut beetroot into \"funky beets\" and served glitterball chicken liver parfait on a flashing dancefloor plate, while another toyed amusingly with the idea of \"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\" felt a bit like gatecrashing a party for five-year-olds. It wasn't the chefs' fault. They are paid to make exceptional food, not jokes, and some of the cooking did look breathtaking. The problem was all in the format. When chefs are cooking recipes of such difficulty that no one at home will try to reproduce them, then the show has to sparkle. This felt like just another hybrid bolted together, that will do nothing much for people who like cookery shows or Comic Relief. Not that hybrids can't be comic. The cricket commentator John Arlott once said of the New Zealand bowler, Bob Cunis: \"Funny Name. Neither one thing nor the other.\" If only the chefs had tried to cook a Cunis. \u2022 Tonight's TV highlights \u2022 Full TV listings"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
