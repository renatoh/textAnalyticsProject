The first is those in the heart of this crisis. The prime minister fighting for his life. The heroic out-of-retirement doctors going back and not returning. The underpaid nurses leaving behind families. The care workers, the bus drivers, the victims \u2013 those final breaths surrounded by ventilator machines and masks instead of wives, husbands and children. The news. The three lecterns, the Skyping journalists, the sheer numbers lost \u2013 they start to become almost meaningless when they get so high. The second world is the rest of us. The lucky ones. Untouched directly \u2013 so far. Each with our own petty lockdown frustrations. Zooming permanently out\u2011of\u2011shot parents, dodging joggers who hurtle round blind corners, the endless washing-up. Eye-rolling at people out in parks complaining about other people who are out in parks. And in the middle of all of it is football just not quite getting it right. As someone put it so perfectly the other day, football is being used as, well, a political football \u2013 amplified even more than normal by social media as we have nothing to do but scroll, refresh, scroll, refresh until our allotted outside time. Twitter bios updated to read: \u201cProud Dad, amateur virologist, keen interest in Football Finance specifically in times of a Global Pandemic.\u201d Everyone is losing at the moment. The Football Association, the Premier League, the EFL, the broadcasters, the players, the fans. Some maybe more than others, but no one benefits. This is the weirdest and most complex situation of our lifetime, none of us know what is going to happen \u2013 and that includes owners, players, broadcasters, MPs \u2026 all of us. Surely we are all going to get it wrong at some point. That doesn\u2019t mean giving people a free pass but it does mean patience, flexibility and understanding: three words seemingly absent from the debate. Until a month ago I would have guessed a reverse furlough was something Jos Buttler might pull out in the IPL. Liverpool\u2019s about-turn appears correct. Is it too simple to suggest that every pound the government puts into furlough is taken away from purchasing or building ventilators or PPE equipment? Probably. But it\u2019s another pound the government won\u2019t have. Liverpool are a business with rich owners and not too many staff \u2013 they can afford it, in a way that perhaps Norwich and Bournemouth can\u2019t. They deserve credit for changing their mind. It\u2019s OK to screw up and admit your mistake. If \u2013 as some seem desperate to see \u2013 you want a league table of who deserves praise right now then they finish below Leeds and the Manchester clubs and above Tottenham and Newcastle. But ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter. They no longer have the government\u2019s money. Park that and let\u2019s move on to the next thing. The question about whether it\u2019s fair for some clubs to furlough when others don\u2019t appears legitimate. And where do you draw the acceptable line \u2013 above or below Newcastle? The answer is more complex. It is going to be different for every club in the pyramid. There won\u2019t be a line. Some League Two clubs won\u2019t need to; some Premier League clubs will. And what of Spurs? You have to hand it to them for continuing their dismal form even when football has completely stopped. Furloughing staff while players run arm in arm in a park in Barnet. Even former players (Kyle Walker) and players who haven\u2019t joined yet (Jack Grealish) are getting involved in damaging the brand. Joe Lewis is a billionaire. Daniel Levy is paid millions of pounds. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters\u2019 Trust put out a very sensible and measured statement asking for an explanation, and followed up saying: \u201cDo not further damage the club\u2019s reputation, listen to your fans.\u201d Surely there was a meeting where Spurs weighed up both options. Now is the time to be crystal clear \u2013 if stadium debt, or whatever, is an issue, then be open about it. Some fans have threatened to give up on their club. Is that even possible? Could you give up on your football team? Surely the subconscious will take over when Hugo Lloris leads them out for their next Premier League game behind closed doors on a training ground in the Midlands? What about the broadcasters? They are due \u00a3762m back if the season isn\u2019t completed. Do they need that money? All of it? Straight away? With no live sport, their subscription numbers will decrease, not to mention the loss of advertising revenue and sponsorship around live games. Everyone loses. And what of the players? The last few days have made us realise that they might actually be like a large group of real humans \u2013 different, impossible to cover with just one label. Most with good intentions, engaged, thoughtful and in touch. A few less so. And while thousands of people who aren\u2019t being asked to give up their wages ask footballers to give up theirs, surely it\u2019s OK for those footballers to at least spend a bit of time working out exactly where their money might go. Of course at the very moment footballers seemed to be winning the PR battle, Walker picked a pursuit completely unachievable while maintaining physical distancing. But others, like Jordan Henderson and Marcus Rashford, are going above and beyond. Footballers leading the way. It\u2019s refreshing. The truth is that football \u2013 like the rest of society \u2013 is struggling to work out how to proceed. So many vested interests, all wanting to do the right thing, but trying to protect themselves at the same time, which is probably what we\u2019re all doing right now. Perhaps I am the only hypocrite. Because while I\u2019ve tweeted Spurs telling them not to take the government\u2019s money, I\u2019ve just bought an exercise bike from a tax-avoiding delivery company. I despair at those stockpiling, but when there was no hand sanitiser three weeks ago I ordered 10 bottles online that have just arrived. (I will give most of them away.) We are all going to get things wrong. And football is no different. Perhaps the key is to realise that some will get more help than others, that it won\u2019t be exactly fair, and no one will get it right all of the time. It never was and they never did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
