Joes Edge and Paris Pike have won the race for Murphy in recent years and the trainer also looked set to go close with Granit D'Estruval, a last-fence faller in 2004. Nine De Sivola is Murphy's leading hope according to jockey bookings but Graham Lee's mount has had a strenuous season. Hot Weld (3.35), by contrast, has had a light campaign. The 18-1 shot broke the course record for 4m1f when winning the National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham last year and his preference for fast ground is a big plus today. After two photo-finish reverses here in the past two years, Paul Nicholls and Ruby Walsh have scores to settle. Napolitain should go well for jumping's top team, as he shaped well when staying on strongly in the Kim Muir Chase at Cheltenham. Newbury 2.10 With blinkers replacing his usual visor, Maraahel can step up on his close third behind Mubtaker and Munsef in this race last year. Ayr 2.25 Fast-ground specialist Yes Sir looked to be returning to form last week when fourth to Aces Four at Aintree, when Faasel was second. He is more reliable in a finish than the runner-up. Newbury 2.40 A straight mile on good ground brings out the best in Plum Pudding, who had a nice warm-up for this on the all-weather last month. Ayr 2.55 It is no surprise to see blinkers on the reluctant Ouninpohja for the first time over hurdles, but a visor did little for him on the Flat. Premier Dane, just a neck behind Ouninpohja in the County Hurdle, can turn the tables on this easier track. Newbury 3.15 Indian Ink is likely to be all the rage and there could be value in siding with Sesmen. Clearly over the top for the season when disappointing at Ascot, she is best judged on her fast-time win in the Prestige Stakes at Goodwood. Newbury 3.55 Though he may not be 100% for this, Dutch Art is so far ahead of his rivals based on juvenile form that his class can see him through. This seven-furlong trip should be well within his powers. Ron Cox's tip of the day Hot Weld 3.35 Ayr It requires something of an act of faith to row in with Ferdy Murphy's stayer, given his unprepossessing form figures this season, but Hot Weld has rarely had ground conditions to his liking. He showed when winning the 4m1f National Hunt Chase last year that he has the necessary attributes for this race and first-time cheekpieces should help Hot Weld continue his return to form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
