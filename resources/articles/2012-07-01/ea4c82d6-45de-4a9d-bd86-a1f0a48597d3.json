And how topical, given the looming holiday season. I have seen one too many tube posters featuring Mummy, Daddy and the little moppets throwing their heads back in laughter against a Photoshopped beach to suppress my gag reflex any more. It's a swiz. I must have been on more than 50 family holidays and I've come to the conclusion that each member of the group subtracts from the pleasure of the others. This is a cruel paradox, understandably not mentioned by travel companies \u2013 but \"holidays\" and \"families\" tend to be incompatible because each person has contradictory aims. The word holiday, from \"holy day\" implies a day of rest. Which, as a working definition, is blackly comic. What I want on a holiday is simple. First, I want to get there and back with the minimum of stress. Children agitate against this. They fight with each other in the car. They demand to be entertained on the train. They are sick on the plane. They ask whether we are there yet. As a general rule, we are not. Having endured the journey, what I hope for is a bit of peace and quiet. I want to read the books I've been waiting to read, lob myself like a side of beef on to a sunbed, and not have to worry about anything. In the evening, I want to have a sumptuous dinner, then fall asleep, slightly drunk, between crisp, white sheets. What my daughters want is different. Primarily, they want to immerse themselves in water. Children love a pool. But they are not content to do 50 lengths and stretch out on the lounger. They want to throw balls to you for hours on end, or play \"here comes the shark\" or \"hold your breath\" or any of a limitless number of aquatic larks, which can exhaust the patience of the most dedicated parent, let alone a 56-year-old grouch with a short attention span. Is that it, when the swimming's over? No, it is not. They want you to do other stuff they enjoy. Teaching them to play tennis, or table-tennis, or beach volleyball or canoeing. This is fun for them. It is dull for you. And made worse by the fact that you have to strenuously pretend that it isn't dull. You may try to catch a break by taking them to a nice art gallery or museum, or by going shopping, but they do not like this. They get bored. They need to be entertained. Given the absence of all their friends, who exist for this purpose, the task falls to you. Then there's the joy of mealtimes. The food may be unfamiliar and the children will insist on eating the sort of crap that is publicly embarrassing. I remember going to a five-star hotel in Mauritius and from the most amazing buffet I've seen in my life, two of my daughters returned with crackers, some butter and a can of cola. It's remarkable how annoying this can be. I know this must seem curmudgeonly, and it is, and I actually have very many happy memories of holidays with my family. Walking on the beach with them, watching them play in the sand, flying kites together, searching for crabs under distant rocks. Seeing their untrammelled happiness, and to be free under open skies is an incredible gift and privilege to witness. In fact, if you think of it as extended childcare, or a very long and expensive Sunday, or an exercise in bonding, then it's a big success. Just don't confuse it with a holiday and you won't be disappointed. \u2022 Follow Tim on Twitter @timlottwriter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
