This, after all, is a 24-year-old who walked straight off at the end of England\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifier with Slovenia in June because Roy Hodgson did not start him at right-back. Clyne has since proved his worth by becoming first choice for Liverpool, whom he joined for \u00a312.5m in the summer, and England, for whom he started five of the final six qualifiers. And now the appointment of Klopp, who replaced Brendan Rodgers at Anfield, has given Clyne a further boost. \u201cWhen you come to a new club you may hold back and don\u2019t take so many risks, but now I\u2019ve played a few games I can take more risks,\u201d he says. \u201cI can go out there and express myself and because he has confidence if you lose the ball you don\u2019t worry. You just go out and do it again. \u201cHe\u2019s tried to make me more confident in my ability as a player to go and express myself \u2013 not to hold back and keep going forward. He said openly: \u2018Don\u2019t hold back, you\u2019re a good player, go forward.\u2019 He\u2019s been just working on my confidence really. He\u2019s extra confident in my ability to get forward and to develop as a player.\u201d Of his role under the German, Clyne says: \u201cI\u2019ll say definitely pressing on the front foot, setting the trap for the opposition team, and getting more forward on the pitch, and [being] solid defensively as well.\u201d Despite a near-perfect performance when Liverpool handed Manchester City a lesson in high pressing and relentless energy during their 4-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium on 21 November, Klopp never stopped shouting on the touchline. This is the German\u2019s default mode during games: a waving, berating, demanding taskmaster. As the man nearest the manager for one half of each match Clyne is aware of the act. \u201cYou can definitely hear him on the sideline,\u201d the defender says. \u201cIf he\u2019s got something to say you can hear him \u2013 he always shouts out tactics and [is] always encouraging players to run faster and put more effort into the game.\u201d Like all the very best managers, Klopp has a softer side. \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t want to make a mistake when you\u2019re playing,\u201d Clyne says. \u201cHe\u2019s a good manager and obviously he can be a good friend as well.\u201d In Wednesday evening\u2019s Capital One Cup quarter-final at Southampton, Clyne could line up alongside Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren to make a trio of former Saints making a return to their former club. \u201cThe fans are always good to me, so I am hoping for a good reception,\u201d Clyne says, before reality kicks in. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it will be good to see the fans, they booed Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren [in previous encounters], so hopefully they\u2019ll get the stick. I hope I get a good reception, I guess it will make a good atmosphere.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s 1-0 victory over Swansea City on Sunday was a first home league triumph under Klopp. It left them only six points behind the leaders, City, and Clyne believes they could make a charge for the title. He says: \u201cWe have just got to keep on putting in performances like we\u2019ve done in the last few games, keep getting wins, and see where we end up. No one has taken the league by storm, so we have to keep focusing on our game, try and get up there and compete for the league. If you can beat the best at the top it definitely gives us the confidence we can go all the way.\u201d The Capital One Cup also offers the prospect of silverware in Klopp\u2019s first campaign. \u201cI definitely think this is a good chance to win a trophy,\u201d says Clyne. \u201cGet a win over Southampton and we will be in the semi and another step towards the final.\u201d And for him personally? With the Euro 2016 finals in France in the summer, there could be a memorable few months ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s a big target, definitely. I want to put in big performances because I know people will be watching and you get picked on form,\u201d says Clyne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
