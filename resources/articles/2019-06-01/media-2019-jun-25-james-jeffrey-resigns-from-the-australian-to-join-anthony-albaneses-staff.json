Jeffrey, who has worked for the News Corp publication for 16 years, is the editor of the humorous daily column Strewth and the author of several books. Jeffrey and Albanese are friends and the Labor leader launched his memoir, My Family and Other Animus, last year. His is the latest in a series of recent departures from the national paper since the election, including social affairs reporter Rick Morton, investigative reporter Anthony Klan, business reporter Ben Butler and veteran football writer Ray Gatt. While Klan and Morton have been critical of the paper\u2019s direction under editor-in-chief Chris Dore, Jeffrey has not disparaged the paper publicly but has never been a cheerleader for the Coalition either. Butler has resigned to join the staff of Guardian Australia. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Australian media company just made 55 journalists redundant across all its mastheads \u2013 on top of dozens of staff in non-editorial areas of the business. Production staff were targeted for redundancy as the production processes have been streamlined. As well as his memoir, Jeffrey has written The Wonks\u2019 Dictionary, with cartoonist Jon Kudelka, and Paprika Paradise about his Hungarian heritage. Morton left the paper after opening up in a public forum about working for the Australian during the election and at a time when the \u201ccraziness has been dialled up\u201d. \u201cThere is a real mood that something has gone wrong,\u201d he said in a podcast posted online by UTS last month. \u201cPeople will tell you going back a decade it used to be a very great paper, and in many ways it still is, but some of the craziness has been dialled up. \u201cWe know what the empire is, we know what the papers do, but something has changed in the last six months. I don\u2019t know what it is. Death rattles or loss of relevance? And journos pretty much spend all day talking about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
