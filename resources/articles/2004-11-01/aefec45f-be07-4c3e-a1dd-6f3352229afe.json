Rudolf Straeuli will watch his Bedford side take on Pertemps Bees in National League One, but he could be forgiven if his thoughts stray 60 miles to a higher profile encounter in south-west London. The 41-year-old Straeuli is back at the East Midlands club where he made a big impression before coaching the Springboks for two controversial years. While reluctant to talk about the Springboks' build-up to last year's World Cup at the infamous \"Camp Barbed Wire\", he thinks much of the criticism that came his way was unmerited. Straeuli compares the goldfish bowl of South African rugby, with its moral maze of rugby and racial politics and often unrealistic expectations, with Sven-Goran Eriksson's stewardship of the England football team. \"The expectations are great in South Africa and for a coach that can be a double-edged sword. It's good that you are made accountable but sometimes perceptions are skewed. It is getting more like South Africa over here since the World Cup, because the game now receives a much much higher profile and expectations are so much higher. Sir Clive [Woodward] was given time in the job to make mistakes and build the team, but I don't think Andy Robinson will find the public so patient. I like Andy and I wish him well, but it will be fascinating to see how he copes without Sir Clive. Before he could concentrate on coaching; now he may have to deal with clubs and get involved in all sorts of peripheral things.\" Straeuli's low-key move back to England began last February, and he is moving back \"bit by bit\". The Bedford director of rugby's wife and two children will join him here from their home in Durban next month. \"I've always remained a shareholder at Bedford and now I help administer and coach the club,\" he said yesterday morning in a break between supervising a session on the scrummaging machine at a rainswept Goldington Road. After Bedford's match tomorrow, Straeuli will travel to London to catch up with the Springbok players. \"I will video the game and I think it will be very, very close, with not more than seven points between the sides. England are a side in transition and they will miss the important players like Johnson, Wilkinson and Hill. But Jonno's loss will be the greatest. In Perth during the World Cup I got the message from my doctor that England were starting to panic a bit after about 20 minutes. But Johnson was able to draw the team together, to settle them down so they could survive the storm. \"We thought we knew how to beat England, to attack them through the outside centre channel, to spread the ball wide, just as Samoa and Wales were to do in the World Cup and Ireland this year. We knew we had the method to beat them but we couldn't do it. \"But the South African pack has now come of age. John Smit and Os du Randt and the two locks give them a real power up front. The English pack is strong but they are rebuilding. Behind them Jaco van der Westhuyzen has learned a lot about the English players from his time in England and Percy Montgomery will also have a fund of information to pass on. Van der Westhuyzen is not a kicking fly-half but he gets the backline moving and Du Preez at scrum-half is very talented and a good kicker of either foot. \"England will play with a lot of enthusiasm and with a new style and will be hard to beat. South Africa will be very motivated after losing in Ireland. Of course I want the Springboks to win but that's not to say I think they will win. And it's difficult for me, I'm trying to develop young English players here, to get Bedford back in the Premiership.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
