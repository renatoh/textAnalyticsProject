Labour's national executive committee (NEC) picked Matt Carter - the party's assistant general secretary with responsibility for policy - to replace David Triesman, who steps down in the new year. After the NEC meeting Mr Carter said: \"I am delighted to have been appointed to this role by the NEC today. The Labour party is a great organisation and I am looking forward to working in my new role with members, stakeholders and staff.\" Labour's chairman, Ian McCartney described Mr Carter's appointment as \"excellent news\". \"Matt brings to the job a breadth of experience working proactively with party members, trade unionists and the party in government,\" he added. \"He is taking up this key role at an important time for the party. We face a busy year of elections in 2004 and I look forward to working with Matt as we prepare for the many challenges we face together.\" An academic, Mr Carter established Forethought, Labour's own thinktank, and has published a study of the political philosopher TH Green, in which he argued that his rejection of classical liberalism influenced RH Tawney and the ethical socialism tradition. His bookish reputation - which comes complete with a history PhD - is understood to have been seen as much as a handicap as an advantage in regards to his application. Mr Triesman was felt to be insufficiently involved in the campaigning side of the party's work - his resignation came after the party's disastrous byelection in Brent East. Mr Carter, however, was able to point to his record as a Labour party organiser - he was previously regional director of the party in the south-west - during his interview by the NEC. Labour's regional director for the north-west, Kevin Lee, and Karen Bartlett of Charter88 were also shortlisted for the post. Mr Carter will now run the party's machine in the run-up to next June's council and European elections, as well as the poll for London mayor and the 2005 general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
