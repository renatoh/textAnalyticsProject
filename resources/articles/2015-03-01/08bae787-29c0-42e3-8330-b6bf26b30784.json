Gosling spoke with Pan\u2019s Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro in Austin about how the film was partly autobiographical. The film features Billy, a single mother (played by Christina Hendricks) who falls behind on her mortgage payments and ends up taking a job in a bank manager\u2019s seedy cabaret club. \u201cI think when you\u2019re a kid and you have a single mom, in a way, all men feel like wolves,\u201d he said, during the engaging back and forth with del Toro. \u201cI remember walking with my mother and guys would whistle at her or cars would start circling. It\u2019s very predatory and very threatening especially when you\u2019re a little kid.\u201d Gosling also spoke about growing up in Canada and fantasizing about Detroit, saying: \u201cwhen you\u2019re Canadian kid, America\u2019s like a bit of a pinup girl you put in your locker. I had all these fantasies about it and Detroit embodied those\u201d. But as parts of the midwest city began to fall into decline, Gosling found the inspiration for Lost River, which was described as a \u201cneon-punk fairytale\u201d by Del Toro and a \u201cdark Goonies\u201d by cinematographer Beno\u00eet Debie. The film premiered at Cannes in May before being panned by critics and was cut to a limited theatrical release. The pair discussed the idea of \u201cfinding the magic in the ruins of society\u201d, and Gosling talked about not wanting to get bogged down in the political arguments that often dominate the discussion about Detroit\u2019s decline. Del Toro also made a series of jokey digs at Gosling, saying he was taking part in the Q&amp;A in order to \u201cshow you the film-maker, not just the meme who says \u2018Hey Girl\u2019\u201d. They also discussed Del Toro\u2019s property Bleek House, which the Mexican director called a \u201cstrange man cave of monsters and books\u201d, while Gosling described a place where \u201ceverything comes to life and follows you\u201d. But despite the jovial atmosphere the film has been a failure for Gosling with Peter Bradshaw describing it as \u201ccolossally indulgent, shapeless, often fantastically and unthinkingly offensive and at all times insufferably conceited\u201d and other critics found fault with the project despite the stellar cast that also includes Matt Smith, Eva Mendes, Saoirse Ronan and Ben Mendelsohn. Lost River screens Saturday night at SXSW (Topfer, 9.30pm)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
