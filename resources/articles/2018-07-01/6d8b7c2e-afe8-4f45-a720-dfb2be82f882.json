Wild left her move characteristically late but overtook her Dutch compatriot in the final few metres of the 64.1km Women\u2019s World Tour race. Marianne Vos finished second ahead of the 2016 Junior World Champion Elisa Balsamo. The British rider Dani Rowe won the intermediate sprint competition, but Wild stole the show by ignoring her team\u2019s woe to become the first woman to win this event twice. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ride so much together,\u201d Wild said afterwards. \u201cBut I have to say it worked really well, it is something we can be really proud of. It\u2019s a nice feeling, and something Wiggle High deserved, to show that we are a team at a really high level.\u201d Wiggle High5 announced this week they would be shutting down at the end of this season after failing to find a new title sponsor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
