According to a new report from Unicef UK, 345 children under the age of 20 could die from violence each day over the next year if the world fails to agree a commitment to safeguarding young people in their homes, schools and communities. The study, which identified El Salvador, Guatemala, Venezuela, Haiti, and Lesotho as the countries with the highest child murder rates, found that more than 75% of child deaths due to violence each day are the result of interpersonal violence, rather than conflict. It also found that children living in poverty \u2013 wherever they are in the world \u2013 are most likely to be victims of violence. The effects of abuse, says the study, are long lasting: not only do child victims of physical, sexual and emotional abuse show brain activity similar to that of soldiers who have seen combat, a third of them are likely to develop long-lasting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Although Unicef estimates that a billion children live in areas affected by conflict, its child protection chief, Susan Bissell, said the violence experienced by boys and girls was far from confined to the battlefield, or to poorer nations. \u201cWe see violence associated with armed gangs \u2013 particularly in Central America \u2013 but what\u2019s shocking is that we\u2019re really talking about everyday acts of violence, including sexual violence, corporal punishment, bullying in playgrounds, violence at the hands of a teacher and violence in the online community,\u201d said Bissell. \u201cThis is part of everyday life for children everywhere around the world. But none of it is inevitable: it is preventable. The wake-up call is to say this is happening in your backyard, this is happening around the corner, this is happening across the ocean and we need to take charge and do something about it.\u201d The report \u2013 Children in danger: act to end violence against children \u2013 says the world\u2019s failure to tackle the issue has made it impossible to deliver the millennium development goals (MDGs) in full, leaving young victims and survivors of violence socially and economically stranded. It urges governments to make a firm commitment to child protection as they discuss the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will replace the MDGs at the end of next year. A target on the issue has already been suggested as part of the proposed goal on promoting \u201cpeaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development\u201d. The report calls on the world to \u201cend abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence and torture against children\u201d. Failure to agree and support such a target, says Unicef, risks reversing the gains made in health and education. According to the report, only 41 countries have implemented an explicit ban on violence against children, while only 2% of countries have a comprehensive legal framework to prevent violence. Noting the UK\u2019s record of campaigning against female genital mutilation, child marriage and sexual violence in conflict, Unicef UK urges Britain to take its place \u201cat the forefront\u201d of moves to protect children from violence. The foreword to the report, written by Baroness Doreen Lawrence \u2013 whose son, Stephen, was murdered in London 21 years ago \u2013 urges the British government to \u201cshow global leadership by ensuring the new [SDG] framework includes an unequivocal commitment to ending violence against children\u201d and by ensuring that commitments are translated into action. \u201cViolence can touch every child\u2019s life \u2013 whether directly or indirectly \u2013 in every part of the world,\u201d said Lawrence. \u201cThe scale of the problem, and the extent of its reach, must not lead to inaction. Without ending the epidemic of violence, vital progress in areas like health and education \u2013 all over the world \u2013 will be undermined and millions more children will be placed at risk.\u201d The report proposes six strategies for tackling \u201ca global problem of epidemic proportions\u201d: supporting parents, caregivers and families; helping children manage the risks they face; changing attitudes that encourage violence and discrimination; promoting and providing support services for children; implementing laws and policies that protect children, and carrying out data collection and research to highlight the scale of the problem. Failure to act quickly and multilaterally, says Unicef, could result in a substantial increase in the global child murder rate, while also raising the prospect of another generation growing up with the notion that violence is acceptable. \u201cWe live in a world where some children are too scared to walk out of their own front doors or play on their streets,\u201d said David Bull, executive director of Unicef UK. \u201cWe want children living in fear to have a chance of feeling safe and secure. A global target would galvanise action to make the world safer for children. We know from Unicef\u2019s work on the ground that violence can be prevented and survivors supported to rebuild their lives \u2013 but this work needs to be rolled out on a wider scale. Each day we delay more children will be exposed to the corrosive impact of violence.\u201d A DfID spokesman said: \u201cWe fully support Unicef\u2019s campaign to end violence against children. Good governance, peaceful societies and the rule of law are all key UK priorities for negotiations post-2015 and are key to protecting children globally.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
