New hotels built on the beach are just a 15-minute trip away from the WWII cemeteries and museum, but it won't just be battlefield tourists here - El Alamein could become 2005's new holiday hotspot, hopes Peltours, the only UK operator offering the historic destination. MD Stuart Lewis said: 'People are always looking for new destinations, and this is great value for money. It's already an upmarket resort for rich Egyptians so it's good for families and couples as well as people wanting to see something of British history.' \u00b7 Peltours (020 8371 5200; peltours.com) launches packages to El Alamein in March 2005; prices start at \u00a3389pp for direct flights and seven nights' half-board accommodation at the five-star Movenpick Hotel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
