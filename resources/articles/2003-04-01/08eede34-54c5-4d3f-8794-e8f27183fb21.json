The dashing journalistic maverick who shocked a nation by exposing the fact that some football fans are violent and, if you stand on a Brixton street corner long enough waving a laptop around your head, someone might steal it. He is Donal MacIntyre, below, the undercover reporter whose ability to infiltrate criminal gangs was tragically hamstrung by the fact that he decided to front his own programme. Indeed, such a brave, some might say narcissistic, decision has come back to haunt our man. Fearing for his life, these days Donal goes nowhere without a bodyguard. Absolutely nowhere. Last Sunday, the great man took it upon himself to run the London marathon and, sadly for the goon who has to protect him, Donal decided he couldn't bare to be apart from his minder, who also had to don singlet and sneakers. Let's hope for his sake that Donal doesn't decide to take up free diving. Or line dancing. Vanity cases And so a weary Diary turns to its current obsession: the burgeoning online industry that is borne from hacks' irresistible urge to set up their own vanity websites. Following Diary's report last week concerning the magnificent efforts of political journalist Ben Leapman to share his life story with his numerous fans, we are startled to report that the Evening Standard ace has a rival on his own paper, no less. 'I'm Mira Bar-Hillel and this is my cat, Minnie,' runs the introduction on the website for the Standard's property correspondent. Free from the shackles of sub-editors, it is clear that hacks know no bounds. Artless Alan To the opening of Saatchi Gallery last Tuesday evening, and Diary for one was startled at the sheer vulgarity of such naked exhibitionism. No, not the scores of nude bodies that bedecked the gallery floor, but BBC supremo Alan Yentob, who, standing at the edge of this veritable orgy of art, turned his back and spent the best part of the evening barking into his mobile phone. Oh Alan, Diary never thought it would have to label you a Philistine. Piers unchequed Much excitement at the Mirror when those in charge of trying to work out how much money the paper's appeal on behalf of Iraqi children had raised stumbled across a cheque from a Mr P Morgan. The amount - \u00a37 - raised a few eyebrows until it was pointed out that the sender was not the well-remunerated Mirror editor but a reader. 'How much has Piers contributed?' went the cry. 'Er... nothing,' the bean counters replied. Plenty of time, though. Half-baked Conrad Black's right-hand man, Dan Colson, attempted to ease any concerns there may have been over at the Telegraph that the paper's parent company, Hollinger, was about to do an Enron. Such a suggestion is of course unfounded, although recent financial manoeuvres by the company have led to speculation it was facing a liquidity crisis. 'These reports are half-truths and innuendo,' Colson told staff in an email. Unfortunately, his soothing words seem to have backfired. 'So we're half-screwed,' worries one insider. Believe... or not Diary is counting the days to the mass gathering of leading newsfolk in Dublin this June. No fewer than 1,000 newspaper publishers, chief executives, managers and editors from more than 90 countries will attend this four-day shindig at swanky Berkeley Court - one of Dublin's top hotels. The hot topic will be 'projections for the future'. Given the amount of Guinness that will inevitably be consumed, Diary can't wait for the results of such blue-sky thinking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
