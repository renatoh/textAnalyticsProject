Daley quit after only one year in his post. Jack Lew, the administration's budget director, will become Obama's third chief of staff as president \u2013 an unusually high turnover in the post. The president praised Daley as an \"outstanding chief of staff during one of the busiest and most consequential years of my administration\", adding that he was intimately involved in decisions on Iraq and Libya, job creation and deficit reduction. \"Obviously this was not easy news to hear,\" the president said. \"No one in my administration has had to make more important decisions more quickly than Bill.\" But there were signs that the administration was losing confidence in Daley, who was brought in to exercise tighter control over a sometimes ill-disciplined White House staff and ease tensions with Republicans in Congress. Disgruntled administration officials told Politico in September that he failed to do either. Daley had indicated he wanted to leave in October after he failed to help Obama forge an important budget deal with Congress, and some of his responsibilities were farmed off to another official, Pete Rouse, who had served as interim chief of staff. Daley said at the time he would stay in his post through Obama's re-election campaign but over the Christmas holidays he apparently changed his mind. He handed in his resignation to the president last week. Obama said he asked Daley to think it over for a day, but Daley remained determined to go. Daley will leave his post at the end of the month, once Lew has completed the administration's budget proposal for congress. Lew served as President Clinton's budget director, and deputy director at the state department under Hillary Clinton before once again becoming budget director in the current administration. The administration appears to be looking to Lew to improve relations with a hostile Republican leadership in Congress, but Obama was at pains to focus on Lew's economic experience. \"Jack's economic advice has been invaluable and he has my complete trust, both because of his mastery of the numbers, and because of the values behind those numbers,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
