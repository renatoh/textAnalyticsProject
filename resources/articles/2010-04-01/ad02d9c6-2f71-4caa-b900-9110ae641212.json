Barely into their 20s, softly spoken, dressed head-to-toe in black, not big on eye contact, the three members of the xx \u2013 singer and guitarist Romy Madley Croft, bassist and vocalist Oliver Sim and drummer Jamie Smith \u2013 have about them something of the suburban goth. It's easier to picture them sitting under a provincial town's war memorial with a bottle of cider than it is to imagine them hanging out with the kind of celebrities who have started turning up at their shows: Courtney Love in New York, REM's Michael Stipe in Paris. This is not a suggestion that goes down very well with Madley Croft. She's been dressing entirely in black since she was 13, she says. \"I lived with my auntie and my cousin when I was growing up, and they always wore black, and I thought it was quite chic. It wasn't a goth or a social group sort of thing.\" \"We ended up with a similar look because we spend all our time together, but it's not a uniform,\" Sim says. \"If I turned up at a rehearsal in bright orange, they wouldn't send me home and make me get changed.\" By current standards, the xx's success seems rather steady and organic. They weren't skyrocketed into the public consciousness by a tidal wave of hype. Partly, you suspect, because their music isn't terribly immediate \u2013 subtle, hushed and, given their youth, strangely mature, the songs on their eponymous debut album don't stun the listener so much as slowly work their way under your skin \u2013 and partly because they are so reticent and shy. Any other band might make a selling point of the fact that Sim is male-model handsome, but the xx decline to appear on their own record sleeves. \"We're very keen,\" Madley Croft says, \"not to be\u2026\" She searches for the right word. \"Flash,\" she decides. The first time I saw them live was on a sweltering late summer night in a tiny London venue. They gave every impression they were going out of their way not to draw attention to themselves, a pretty odd thing to do when you're performing in front of 500 people. That said, the disparity between what was happening on stage \u2013 or, rather, what wasn't happening, unless you count watching black-clad, motionless figures wearing expressions that run the emotional gamut from morose to I-was-forced-here-at-gunpoint an unmissable visual feast \u2013 and what came out of the speakers held the audience rapt. It sounded languid, satiated, postcoital. Sim and Madley Croft's vocals were softly yearning. It was all deeply mysterious and bewitching. Madley Croft looks slightly horrified at the notion that their songs appear largely to be about sex \u2013 which seems a bit rich coming from a woman who appears to spend most of the debut album on her knees, being subsumed beneath various raging tides, asking if she can make it better with the lights turned on or repeatedly begging persons unknown to go slow. \"I can honestly say that I've never sat down and thought, 'This song is about sex'.\" She frowns. Really? \"We were writing these songs when we were 17,\" she says firmly, the faintest hint of what-are-you-some-kind-of-pervert entering her voice. \"I don't think we were sitting down and overtly being like, 'This song is about my sex life'.\" In fact, she says, she couldn't say for certain what the songs are about, thanks to the peculiar way they construct their duets: Sim and Madley Croft each write the lyrics they sing, never telling each other what they're writing about. \"It always felt very comfortable and natural to be sort of sharing and collaging our lyrics,\" Madley Croft says. \"We don't really have to explain to each other what we're singing about, because I already have such an emotional attachment to things Oliver is singing. It's in the same way that, with your favourite songs, you don't really want to know what the artist is writing about, because then you can put them into your own life, like, 'Oh, this is my song.'\" They have managed to maintain a degree of mystery, no mean feat in an age of internet messageboards and gossip websites. For Jamie Smith, this comes via the simple expedient of not saying anything. At one point during the interview, he yawns and mentions that he prefers playing electronic drums to real ones; it slowly becomes clear that this represents a dizzying pinnacle of soul-baring loquacity that he will never again scale in my company. Madley Croft and Sim, meanwhile, have developed an impressive sideline in drawing a discreet veil over things. A couple of early interviews openly referred to the pair as gay, which would certainly add a whole extra level of intrigue to their lovelorn duets, but these days a veil is drawn over their sexuality: interviewers are minded not to ask, because they're not going to get an answer. They used to be a quartet, but just as the xx's success snowballed, keyboard player Baria Qureshi departed in slightly mysterious circumstances just before a London gig. They still played, and Sim seemed close to tears on stage as he announced her departure, but a veil has been drawn over that as well. \"Things had changed between us,\" Sim says. \"The social dynamic wasn't working.\" So no one really knows that much about them, beyond the fact that Sim and Madley Croft were thrust together as toddlers by their parents and have been best friends ever since \u2013 their earliest memory is of playing together in a sandpit when they were two or three. And that all the band's members attended Putney's Elliott school, a comprehensive that has in recent years, for reasons no one seems entirely able to explain, turned out a remarkable number of left-field musicians: its list of alumni includes Hot Chip, experimental electronic producer Kieran \"Four Tet\" Hebden, Mercury-nominated dubstep producer Burial, indie band the Maccabees and \"folktronic\" singer-songwriter Adem. Given the amount of time they now spend together in the cramped confines of a tour bus \u2013 a state of affairs that frequently drives bands to murderous distraction \u2013 you might reasonably expect Madley Croft and Sim to be sick of the sight of each other, but apparently not. \"We've been at school together virtually every day, all of our lives,\" Madley Croft says, \"so it feels quite natural to see Oliver every day.\" Sim nods: \"I think it would be weirder if we didn't.\" Elliott school is a topic they seem heartily sick of discussing. \"It gets mentioned all around the world,\" Madley Croft says. \"You just don't expect to hear so much about this average comprehensive school where there's lots of different types of people, with different backgrounds, and different interests and styles and music tastes. I'm really glad to have gone to such an eclectic place, but it's not this holy grail of music.\" No, they say, the xx never appeared at the school's Friday lunchtime \"performance sessions\" that Kieran Hebden set up to nurture incipient musical talent: \"To perform in front of a room full of people you go to school with would be terrifying,\" Sim says. \"I couldn't do it now.\" Indeed, they didn't even bother to tell their schoolmates they had formed a band. This was perhaps unremarkable in the early days, when their musical ambitions, encouraged by their music-loving parents \u2013 Sim's mother, who \"developed this massive passion for Jack White\", took them to the Reading Festival and Brixton Academy to see the White Stripes when they were 14 \u2013 extended no further than crudely fashioning covers of songs by Pixies and, more surprisingly, Wham!'s Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go (\"Our version was pretty dark\") in their bedrooms. But they didn't even tell people when they began playing gigs around London and attracting record label interest. \"I don't know why,\" Madley Croft says. \"By that point I already felt a bit dislocated from the school and the people there anyway, so it didn't feel necessary to brag or show off that we were in a band.\" Perhaps their reticence had something to do with the fact that the gigs they played were, in Madley Croft's words, \"a bit soul-destroying\". Their songs were so quiet \u2013 not least because they recorded them at the dead of night, playing and singing softly so as not to wake her father \u2013 and so \"everyone would talk the whole way through our set\". \"If there were three people in the front row who were into it,\" she says, \"that was a success.\" No one talks during their gigs now, but success has brought its own problems. Sim was recognised in Sainsbury's the other day: from the way he tells the story, you get the impression this was not an event that filled him with joy. He worries how he'll write lyrics now that he knows people other than the band will hear them. \"This album was done with no expectations,\" he says. \"No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will\u2026\" His voice tails off and he smiles: \"I might feel I have to be a bit more private.\" \u2022 The xx's self-titled debut album is out on Young Turks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
