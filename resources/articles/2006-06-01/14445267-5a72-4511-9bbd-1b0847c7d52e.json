Yes, it has been a tough few weeks. There have been self-inflicted wounds and the Tory party, helped by a media temporarily missing all critical faculties when it comes to David Cameron, is on the up. But no matter how tricky the present period, none of this means that some of our MPs are already \"dead-meat\" at the next election, as Jackie remarkably claimed. If, as Harold Wilson said, a week is a long time in politics, then Jackie is premature in writing MPs off three to four years out from the next general election. Nor do I recognise Jackie's description of a party where \"discipline seems to be fraying\". We are, however, in danger of making our task a lot harder if our own MPs go round suggesting the game is up. When they next get the urge, I suggest a pinch of historical perspective might be a helpful antidote. Jackie is right to note that people no longer dismiss Cameron as \"a flash in the pan\". We should take him seriously. But I believe the shine will soon come off the new-look Tories when people discover that the substance is not so new after all. More importantly, I believe that the government will get credit for taking the hard decisions needed to provide security and justice for our country in the long-term. That's the way you win and retain trust and support. That should be the focus of Labour's conference in Manchester this autumn, not as Jackie suggests yet more leadership speculation. She's right to say \"the usual pattern won't work\" for our conference - which is why we are planning a conference which looks and feels different from the normal format. I don't believe the merchants of doom speak for the rank and file of our membership. I am afraid that I put rather less weight than Jackie on a survey of party attitudes which actually included more ex-members than current ones. The members I speak to are desperate for Labour's representatives to settle down and get on with it. They look at the newspaper headlines, scratch their heads, and wonder what on earth we are doing. They know from their own streets and estates that there is still a huge task ahead of us if we are to create a socially just society. They are proud of what we have achieved but can see there is more to be done to improve school results and discipline, to bring NHS waiting lists down even further, to get more police in the community and to tackle anti-social behaviour. As Labour party chair, I am not afraid of debate. Discussing ideas with people who share your values is one of the reasons we all joined. But we should never forget there is a difference between a debate and an argument. The former gives us vitality and strength. The latter simply assists the Tories. One thing all Labour party members can agree on is that a fourth term for Labour is infinitely preferable to a first term for the Conservatives. \u00b7 Hazel Blears is chair of the Labour party blearsh@parliament.uk \u00b7 If you wish to respond, at greater length than in a letter, to an article in which you have featured either directly or indirectly, email response@theguardian.com or write to Response, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
