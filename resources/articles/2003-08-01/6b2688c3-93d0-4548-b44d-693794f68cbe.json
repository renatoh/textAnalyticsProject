Three races remain and three drivers are separated by two points. Formula one has the finale it craves. With 30 points to race for, Michael Schumacher has 72, one ahead of Juan Pablo Montoya and two ahead of Kimi Raikkonen. There is every chance that the championship will not be resolved until the final race of the year at the Suzuka circuit in Japan, the scene of so many dramatic championship shoot-outs. This extraordinary situation resulted from Raikkonen finishing second in his McLaren-Mercedes, Montoya third in his Williams-BMW and Schumacher a disbelieving eighth, lapped by Alonso's Renault in the closing stages. It is doubtful if the five-times world champion has ever had to work so hard for a single championship point but Ferrari remained tight-lipped last night after a disastrous showing from their tyre supplier Bridgestone. Schumacher was their best-placed finisher. The Italian team's misery was compounded by Rubens Barrichello crashing out of yesterday's race in spectacular fashion after a major rear suspension breakage after 19 laps while running fifth. Starting from the second pole position of his career Alonso, driving for Renault, led all but one of the 70 laps to enter the history books with his first win at 22 years one month, three months younger than Bruce McLaren when he won the 1959 United States grand prix. \"It's too early; it's like a dream at the moment,\" said an ecstatic Alonso. \"With 10 laps to go hearing noises from the engine and the gearbox in my mind. It was fantastic. I need this victory to grow up this year and have more chance next season. \"I came here with a good feeling. I love the track here and after qualifying I knew there was a good chance of finishing on the podium, then in the first stint I started thinking that I could win, because after 12 laps or so I was 20 seconds ahead. \"We are not fighting for the championship but my Renault was fantastic here this weekend. The chassis was excellent and, although the engine may not be the quickest, it is light, with a low centre of gravity which helped on these tight corners.\" The Hungaroring is all about lack of grip, unpredictable track conditions and a treacherous spin into the barriers awaiting anybody who strays off line. And that is before taking into account the variations of grip experienced by the cars on newly laid extensions to this tight little track near Budapest. The main straight had been lengthened in the hope that it might produce a touch more overtaking. It was not enough to prevent Mark Webber from keeping his Jaguar in a seemingly impregnable second place to the point that Alonso was 20 seconds ahead after only 11 laps. By the time the midfield pack had muscled past the dogged Australian, the remarkable Alonso had vanished into the distance. Webber eventually finished a strong and deserved sixth. Once ahead of the Jaguar, Raikkonen drove his McLaren-Mercedes flat out the whole way to take second place: \"Of course you want to win, but second place was the best we could do here today,\" he said. \"Webber's Jaguar was holding me up by about a second a lap. The car is basically the same as at the start of the season but we will have a new aerodynamic package for the next race so we're hoping that things will be even better.\" In the BMW-Williams camp Montoya and Ralf Schumacher crossed the line separated by just over a second in third and fourth places, good enough to propel the team into the lead of the constructors' championship with 129 points to Ferrari's 121. The younger Schumacher holds fourth place in the championship on 58 points. \"I backed off a little bit when I was keeping an eye on Ralf,\" said Montoya, who survived a quick spin in the closing stages. \"If we'd had a good start I think we had a big speed advantage in the street, so I think it was a matter of strategy. But by the second corner I was eighth and Ralf was last.\" Ferrari and Bridgestone are planning a vigorous counter-attack at a three-day test starting at Monza on September 2. Bridgestone have been working away behind the scenes of their technical department in Japan during the testing ban of the past six weeks and are confident they can bounce Ferrari back into contention in time for the Italian grand prix on September 14. Yet it may all be too late. Many formula one insiders believe the momentum has passed to Raikkonen and Montoya and that Schumacher has been stripped of any tactical margin in which to operate. The remaining three races of the season promise to be electrifying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
