The business, which is controlled by Dragons\u2019 Den panellist Peter Jones, has been considering a restructure for several months and first warned it may have to call in administrators in October. Jones, who bought Jessops out of administration in 2013, is thought to want to cut costs by renegotiating rents and closing loss-making stores. The chain has 46 outlets. Administrators from advisory firm ReSolve were appointed to JR Prop earlier this week. The retailer\u2019s main trading company, Jessops Europe, is not affected by the administration and Jones is thought to want to keep the business going. The most recent accounts for the parent company Jessops Group, covering the year to the end of April 2018, show it bounced back from a \u00a3765,000 loss in 2017 to make a profit of \u00a3722,000as sales rose nearly 20% to \u00a3120m. However, times on the high street have got tougher in the past year and a string of high street chains have called in administrators or been forced to restructure amid rising costs, lacklustre consumer spending and the switch to online shopping. Jessops is thought to have called in administrators after failing to win backing from landlords for an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement which would have enabled store closures and rent cuts. Its collapse into administration comes after a similar move by Clintons, the card retailer. It was bought out of administration in a pre-agreed deal with its owning Weiss family earlier this week. The deal, which safeguards 2,500 jobs, came after Clintons also failed to win support from landlords for a CVA to close up to 66 stores."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
