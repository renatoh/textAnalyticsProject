According to new research from Datamonitor, the London-based market research company, sales of organic produce are likely to increase to almost \u00a33bn by 2005 in the UK. Britain's market for organic food is the third largest in Europe - Germans are the biggest con sumers - but the UK market is likely to grow faster than the US and any other European country. \"UK consumers are expected to become the largest consumers of organic food by 2005, with per capita expenditure set to total $69.5, well above the European average of $42,\" says Datamonitor. The growth is fuelled by widespread concerns about genetically modified organisms, food scares and a growing interest in healthy eating, according to the research company, which was established in 1989 and made its debut on the stock market earlier this year. The demand is also driven by changing consumer attitudes - people have been willing to spend more on food to guarantee better quality. \"Consumer confidence in food production methods has been eroded and a demand for improved food safety checks has arisen. Organic values will increasingly make their way into the non-organic supply chain and force food manufacturers to refocus on safety, as opposed to quantity and price.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
