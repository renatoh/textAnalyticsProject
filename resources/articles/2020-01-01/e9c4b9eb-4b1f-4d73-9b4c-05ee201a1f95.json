But just 78 days on from the humiliating 9-0 home defeat to Leicester, Southampton will face Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side at the King Power Stadium on Saturday in the return fixture, having turned their season around in spectacular style. Ditching a three-man defence in favour of the high-energy 4-2-2-2 formation that served him so well in guiding RB Leipzig to second place in their debut Bundesliga season in 2017, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has navigated Southampton away from the bottom three and towards safety after collecting 16 points from their past eight matches. Yet the Austrian, who spent most of the summer in 2013 riding between Borussia Dortmund\u2019s and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s training camps on his mountain bike and spying on their sessions with a pair of binoculars when he was out of work, admitted even he had his doubts about his methods after that traumatic night at St Mary\u2019s. \u201cThere was a moment when I also must be self-critical and see that I was on the wrong path,\u201d says Hasenh\u00fcttl. \u201cThis was the not the way I wanted to play normally. When you lose the path it\u2019s like with a player \u2013 you must be self-critical and honest with yourself. \u201cI think you have to find the right decision and the right solutions. And then you must say: \u2018OK you\u2019ve got no more stable in going back deeper, deeper, deeper, so you must come again on the front foot.\u2019 This was a brave decision \u2013 when someone has to be brave then it\u2019s first the manager. \u201cAnd then the players can follow. But if you\u2019re not brave how can they follow? I think it\u2019s important that I showed the right direction again and the players are following.\u201d The 52-year-old former centre\u2011forward who won eight caps for his country once had a trial at Chelsea under Glenn Hoddle and had always wanted to manage in the Premier League before he was finally handed the opportunity by Southampton in December 2018. Having steered the Saints away from relegation trouble last season with two games to spare, Hasenh\u00fcttl had been expected to build on their momentum. But the defeat against Leicester \u2013 the worst in the club\u2019s 134-year history \u2013 was stark evidence that something needed to change, even if the thought of resigning never even crossed his mind. \u201cNo, never. I never thought about walking away,\u201d he says. \u201cI only thought about whether my club trusts me and I want to show that I am not at the end of my ideas and how I wanted to turn the tables. I can tell you that we have never stopped trying everything and, finally, the success came back.\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl adds: \u201cA few days ago I had an interview with a German newspaper and they asked me if I feared I could get sacked after this match. I said: \u2018If you lose one match 9-0 and you still stay alive you lose any fear you have.\u2019 This is exactly the moment I have. I feel I have a club which is absolutely behind me and the way we want to work here. They can see our philosophy and I\u2019m happy that my team is showing we can be more successful. For sure it makes it more fun in the moment.\u201d The reintroduction of the tried and tested system honed in Germany has certainly helped Southampton\u2019s cause, having seen his side concede just 13 goals in 11 Premier League games since they last faced Leicester. While fringe players such as the defender Jack Stephens and the wide man Stuart Armstrong have stepped up in recent weeks, it has been the performances of the captain, James Ward-Prowse, and the forward Danny Ings \u2013 who, as Gareth Southgate will surely have taken note, has 13 league goals this season \u2013 that have offered tangible proof Hasenh\u00fcttl is finally getting his message across. \u201cIt took a long time to not only get the right shape but the right behaviour in this shape,\u201d he admits. \u201cAnd this is a lot about being brave and on the front foot. It\u2019s not enough to show them and speak about this, it\u2019s to live this system and live this behaviour. It took a long time and finally in the last month I had the feeling that it clicked in the minds. You could feel it. \u201cEvery player is now absolutely convinced about what we are doing. Even against the big teams we play with a back four, we changed the shape and stood on the gameplan and were successful.\u201d Southampton lost their next three matches after the defeat to Leicester, before two morale-boosting home victories against fellow strugglers Norwich and Watford. Now unbeaten in their last five, they will travel to the east Midlands having won 2-1 there last season despite Yan Valery\u2019s red card just before half\u2011time. \u201cPlaying the last two games against them with one man down is enough I think!\u201d says Hasenh\u00fcttl with a laugh. \u201cThe way we play now is a different one not just because of the shape but because of the behaviour. We are back to our basics, our automatism, and this is the only way to be successful again. Let\u2019s have a look at how good we are.\u201d There will no hiding from what happened last time, however. \u201cWe will speak about it definitely as a topic in our preparing for the game,\u201d he adds of the 9-0 defeat. \u201cIn what way I\u2019m not so sure at the moment. But we cannot make it unhappen, this result happened and as I said we can take energy out of this result. What the team showed after this result, where we knew it was an absolute disaster for us, was absolutely outrageous from the mentality and character to fight back to a successful way. When you look now how the team is playing it looks completely different and I cannot praise them enough for the reaction they\u2019ve showed. Maybe a thank you for this evening because it was an important one for us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
