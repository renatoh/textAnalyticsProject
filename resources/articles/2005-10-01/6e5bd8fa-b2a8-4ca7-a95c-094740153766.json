Speculation has surrounded the spa and gambling town of Baden-Baden but other venues are being considered. Andy Battson, the government's football attach\u00e9 in Germany, said Baden-Baden was one of three possibilities. \"My understanding is that the choice was narrowed down to two possible venues. A third was added at the last minute. No final decision has been taken yet as far as I'm aware.\" Football Association officials visited Germany in advance of England's qualification this month to look for locations but the announcement could be delayed until after the draw on December 9. An FA spokesman said: \"There has been no final decision.\" Jonathan Woodgate's chances of making England's World Cup squad received a boost last night when David Beckham revealed that Sven-Goran Eriksson has monitored the defender's progress during his 17-month injury ordeal. Woodgate made a scoring Champions League debut for Real Madrid on Wednesday, his fourth match of the season, and the England captain said he was high on Eriksson's agenda. \"The manager always asks me how Woody is. He is never out of his thoughts,\" said Beckham, who has urged the Swede to visit Madrid to see Woodgate, who has won five caps, the last against Sweden in 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
