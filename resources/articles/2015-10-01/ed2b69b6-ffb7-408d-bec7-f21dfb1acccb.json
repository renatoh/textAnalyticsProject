An increasing number of women are choosing to specialise in menswear \u2013 and doing so very successfully. Perhaps they benefit from knowing what makes a man look good through the eyes of a woman; perhaps they can be more objective. I went to meet three designers at the forefront of everything that is good and exciting about menswear at the moment, mainly to ask their advice on how I should be dressing. If nothing else, I\u2019m self-interested. The three are producing wildly different collections, but covering some of the biggest trends right now: sportswear, functional workwear and pared-back simplicity. Whistles Menswear has only just celebrated its first birthday, but has already established itself as a destination for high- quality classics; Lou Dalton is a mainstay of LC:M with her beautifully constructed, often worker-inspired collections, and Astrid Andersen is pushing streetwear forward with her innovative use of fabric and colour. Rosamund Ward Rosamund Ward joined Whistles two years ago and set about creating its menswear division. When I pitched up she immediately recognised that my grey marl sweatshirt was from British menswear brand Albam. She worked there for almost five years and remembered getting the cuff detail made. No doubt those eagle eyes come in useful. She describes working at Albam as being a \u201ccomplete education into the design and manufacturing of really quality clothing\u201d. Her collections for Whistles are all about the detail. \u201cOur customers are everyday men looking for really simple pieces, done really, really well,\u201d she says. \u201cWe make pieces that you want to become favourites. Everyday tees, perfect jeans and amazing knits. Garments that become faithfuls.\u201d She dressed me in some of those \u201cperfect jeans\u201d, a new collaboration with much-loved Japanese denim brand Edwin, teamed with a bang-on-trend shearling-collar deck jacket. Ward points out that in menswear you can take something like a classic overshirt and make it in suede to become something completely new. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that far away from a wardrobe essential \u2013 it\u2019s not like a three-legged monster or anything.\u201d Ward finds inspiration in what men are wearing on the tube on the way to work, checking out where their shoes are from, how their trousers fit\u2026 And if there is one mistake that men should avoid? \u201cDeep-V T-shirts.\u201d You know who you are, and now you\u2019ve been told. Astrid Andersen If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Astrid Andersen\u2019s label, she makes sportswear-inspired luxury items like lace hoodies, oversized vests and, memorably, a carnation-pink floral velvet tracksuit for a Topman capsule collection last year. I was curious to see how she would dress me. I\u2019m a confident man, but I know my limits. When I arrived Astrid gave me a hoodie, and to my relief there was no lace in sight. While it might not be for me, she tells me that in the last collection the rose-pink lace hoodies (to be worn over a T-shirt) were among her bestsellers, behind easier pieces like the logo tees. \u201cSportswear is no longer a trend,\u201d said Andersen. \u201cIt\u2019s here to stay.\u201d There has, she says, been a generational shift, where success is no longer always associated with a suit. \u201cI can see a guy in a tracksuit and know that he\u2019s successful.\u201d She dismisses the notion of \u201cunisex\u201d as outdated. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to put a label on whether a piece is for men or women.\u201d Andersen\u2019s whole ethos is really refreshing and based around putting men in clothes that make her find them attractive. She thinks confidence and comfort are the same thing. \u201cI cringe at the thought of a guy wearing something and you can tell it\u2019s restricting him \u2013 it\u2019s so unsexy. So don\u2019t do that,\u201d she advises. \u201cBe comfortable.\u201d Lou Dalton \u201cMy clothes are not for a shrinking violet, but they won\u2019t scare the horses either,\u201d says Lou Dalton. Her collections are intriguing without being too showy. She is obsessed with the construction of her garments and puts that down to a three-year apprenticeship she did from the age of 16, making mainly shooting attire \u2013 traditional sportswear and workwear \u2013 for Purdey &amp; Sons. For the first year all she did was work on pockets \u2013 getting the tension right between a piece of lining and some wool fabric. That education was worth it. \u201cThe only thing I can\u2019t make is a pair of underpants and a pair of shoes,\u201d she says. Given her background it\u2019s no shock that she often references workwear in her collections, although she was keen to point out that she\u2019s \u201cnot here to rehack something that\u2019s already been done. We want to create a classic of our own.\u201d Her favourite pieces for AW15 are double layered to show off the exterior and interior of the garment so the construction is visible. \u201cI was on a bit of a mission \u2013 you wanna see construction? I\u2019ll give you construction!\u201d Lou\u2019s one piece of advice for men is this: invest in a really good pair of shoes. On her way to work she goes through the City on the bus. \u201cThe number of blokes who are wearing all-right suits but the shoe\u2026 is just shocking! A way to a woman\u2019s heart is through a good shoe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
