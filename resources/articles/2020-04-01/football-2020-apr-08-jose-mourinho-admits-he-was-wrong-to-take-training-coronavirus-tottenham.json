The Tottenham manager was pictured on Hadley Common with Ndombele \u2013 in breach of the government regulations that permit people to exercise outdoors during the coronavirus pandemic only with members of their household. Elsewhere on the common two other Spurs players \u2013 Davinson S\u00e1nchez and Ryan Sessegnon \u2013 were pictured running together, failing to respect the two-metre physical-distancing requirement. A witness has told the Guardian he saw Ndombele, S\u00e1nchez and Sessegnon walking off after they had finished their workouts and they were 20 metres apart. The players live locally. The witness also said he saw Juan Foyth \u201con his own about a mile down the road\u201d and Serge Aurier \u201cabout a mile after that\u201d. There is no indication Foyth and Aurier breached the guidelines. Spurs were moved to remind their players to respect physical distancing when exercising outdoors and Mourinho issued a statement on Wednesday. \u201cI accept that my actions were not in line with government protocol and we must only have contact with members of our own household,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt is vital we all play our part and follow government advice in order to support our heroes in the NHS and save lives.\u201d The Portuguese is understood to be adamant that he adhered to physical distancing when with Ndombele and two other unidentified men on the common, even if that rather missed the point about his being there with them in the first place. Mourinho has publicly criticised Ndombele since he took over last November, struggling to hide his frustration at the poor fitness and erratic performances of the club\u2019s record signing. But everybody at Spurs has seen Ndombele\u2019s quality in training and it has been noted that Mourinho would have taken such a strong line with the player only because he cares about drawing the best from him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
