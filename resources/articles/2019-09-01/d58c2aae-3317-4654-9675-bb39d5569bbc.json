For the second time in three years, Spain has stood between Australia\u2019s male basketballers and a historic achievement. Twice now, the Spanish \u2013 for so long the unchallenged second power in global basketball \u2013 have been run close by the Boomers. But in Beijing as in Rio de Janeiro, the Australians were unable to overcome them. A frustrating case of de ja vu. Friday\u2019s double-overtime loss in the Fiba World Cup semi-final will not easily be forgotten. But for some questionable refereeing decisions, or had Patty Mills\u2019 converted both of his late free-throws, Australia would be in the World Cup final for the first time ever. Instead, they must regroup for the bronze medal match. That won\u2019t be easy. \u201cThey\u2019re crushed and furious,\u201d the team\u2019s assistant coach Luc Longley said afterwards. It might be easy to cast responsibility elsewhere. Boomers\u2019 star Andrew Bogut was incensed, yelling post-match: \u201cGoogle where the headquarters of fucking Fiba is ... it\u2019s a fucking disgrace\u201d (Fiba\u2019s headquarters are in fact in Switzerland, not Spain). But this is Australia\u2019s third consecutive major tournament ended by a tight loss: a one point defeat against Turkey in 2014, a one point loss to Spain in 2016 and now this double-overtime thriller. The Boomers\u2019 recurring inability to see out close games is curious, given the high-level experience possessed by some members of the Australian squad. Four players have NBA championships to their name \u2013 Bogut, Mills, Aron Baynes and Matthew Dellavedova \u2013 all veterans of high-pressure, late-game scenarios. Yet that experience went missing in the final minutes on Friday. It might be tempting to point the finger at coach Andrej Lemanis, but players speak highly of the long-time national team coach and his tactical decision-making in China has been astute. Whatever the cause, it is an area in desperate need of improvement. A smarter Australian team would have iced Friday evening\u2019s encounter in the final quarter of regular time. While some refereeing decisions may have been frustrating, ultimately the Boomers have only themselves to blame. Another tournament, another case of what could have been. Despite the disappointment, there are plenty of positives for Lemanis and company. Local NBL star Nick Kay has been an unexpected standout, while the ever-reliable Mills is a contender for player of the tournament. His foul-mouthed rant will likely land him in disciplinary trouble, but 34-year-old Bogut has been a stable defensive presence for the Boomers. A bright future may do little to salve the immediate wounds of the semi-final defeat. \u201cI feel fucking stabbed in the heart by that,\u201d quipped Longley. But the Boomers\u2019 run in China is a cause of optimism ahead of the 2020 Olympics. With the likes of Ben Simmons, Dante Exum, Thon Maker, Ryan Broekhoff and Jonah Bolden likely to the bolster the squad next July, Australia\u2019s star power in Tokyo will be eclipsed by only the United States. Another deep run can be expected, and possibly yet another opportunity for redemption against Spain. But before Australian eyes turn to the Olympics, the Boomers\u2019 work in China is not yet complete \u2013the team now face France in the bronze medal match. While Australia defeated the French by two points in the second round, the Rudy Gobert-led side were buoyed by their quarter-final victory over the United States. They were no match for Argentina in the other semi-final, but will pose a stern test on Sunday. The Boomers are no strangers to bronze medal encounters; this will be the fourth for assistant coach Longley, twice as a player and now his second from the bench. Yet Australia have never won bronze at either a World Cup or the Olympic. Will 2019 be the year that medal drought ends? Patrick Hunt is one of the coaches who established the Australian Institute of Sport basketball program four decades ago, a system that has proven pivotal to Australia\u2019s success in the sport. A majority of the current Boomers players went through the AIS program, many of whom would have heard the veteran coach\u2019s favourite phrase. \u201cWe should aspire for perfection, but excellence will be tolerated,\u201d Hunt likes to say. Their heart-breaking loss to Spain may have cruelled the Boomers\u2019 hopes of perfection at the Fiba World Cup. But if Australia beat France on Sunday, the nation\u2019s first ever medal in international basketball would still be a truly excellent result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
