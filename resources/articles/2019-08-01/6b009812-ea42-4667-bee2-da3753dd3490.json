I\u2019ll leave you with the brilliant Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from Molineux. Night! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks \u201cWe knew they would come out like a house on fire in the second half, and they got the goal they probably deserved. We took control again after that and we could have won it. I thought we finished the game the strongest. The first half was a mature performance, the second was a bit sloppier. We\u2019re a young team and we are improving. You have to learn on the pitch. \u201cPaul and Marcus are the designated penalty-takers, and it\u2019s up to them to decide there and then who feels, \u2018This is mine.\u2019 That\u2019s our system, you can see the slides on the Powerpoint. [Will it change?] No, not at all. The two of them have been very confident and I like players with confidence. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a booking [for Daniel James]. I haven\u2019t seen the video; if you\u2019ve got it, show it me, but when I saw it live I didn\u2019t think it was a dive. He gets kicked a lot because of his pace.\u201d Ruben Neves speaks \u201cWe had to adjust at half-time. Man Utd started really well, pressed us high up the pitch, and we found it difficult to control the game. We adjusted, took some risks and did well in the second half. \u201cWe worked on that corner during the week, and fortunately I scored. I\u2019m really happy. It\u2019s horrible, honestly [waiting for VAR], but that\u2019s football now. Thankfully this time they gave us the goal.\u201d Sky\u2019s football coverage is great, part 431242342389 Gary Neville: \u201cIt\u2019s not like ... spin the bottle.\u201d Jamie Carragher: \u201cWho\u2019ve you played spin the bottle with?!\u201d That was Pogba\u2019s fourth penalty miss in a year. He\u2019s missed 36 per cent of his Premier League penalties. Marcus Rashford, I think, has missed 0 per cent of his in senior football. Neville is properly on one about the penalty. He\u2019s said \u201cthis is not right\u201d umpteen times. \u201cThis is a Manchester United penalty. This is not a tombola. This is not under-5s on the playground.\u201d Here\u2019s Gary Neville on Paul Pogba \u201cBefore he even took the penalty I was fuming. I\u2019m not sure whether Rashford took the one off Pogba last week or vice versa tonight. Why is there a debate on who takes a penalty? There should never be a debate. There wasn\u2019t a leader on the pitch tonight. Something\u2019s not right there. At first I thought, \u2018It\u2019s typical you, you\u2019re selfish, why are you even thinking about taking a penalty off a player?\u2019 But we\u2019ve looked at the footage of last week\u2019s penalty and Pogba and Rashford had a long chat before that as well. It\u2019s weird. Only Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can tell us what happened.\u201d Well, that was a lot of fun. Martial scored a fine goal, Neves equalised with a scorcher and Pogba missed a penalty. Both teams will feel they could have won, United in particular, but both will be reasonably happy with a point. United almost stole it at the last, when Pogba\u2019s low cross just evaded Martial. Shaw spanked the loose ball at Patricio but by then Pereira had been penalised for blocking a defender. Peep peep! 90+3 min Nothing much is happening. 90+1 min Another Wolves sub: Patrick Cutrone replaces the marvellous Raul Jimenez. 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. Neto tries to run Wan-Bissaka, who stalks him and makes another fine interception. 90 min Maguire slides a nice pass down the inside-left channel to find Martial, who is wrongly flagged offside. 89 min A double change for United: Greenwood replaces James, Pereira replaces Rashford. 88 min \u201cThe incessant moaning about VAR is worse than any amount of time \u2018wasted\u2019 on getting correct refereeing decisions,\u201d says Gustav Bj\u00f6rklund. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have VAR tonight, former top 6 club players turned pundits would be zooming in on still footage with evidence of error in refeering, complaining that it was missed, or saying they got away with it, based on which club they played for. That is not a better system. It doesn\u2019t matter if someone is 5 millimeters or 5 meters offside - the rule still applies, and he same goes for handball or any other offence. It\u2019s the same as before, where a human referee makes a judgement call, helped by the three other officials in the stadium, only now the ref on the pitch is helped on by yet another ref, this one in a shed near Heathrow. The moaning has to stop.\u201d But what about the people moaning about the people moaning? 87 min A Wolves sub: Neto on, Jota off. 86 min Wolves break superbly down the left through Jota, whose deep cross is screwed over the bar from a tight angle by Dendoncker. 85 min And this is no different, Mata failing to clear the first man. 85 min James beats Jota superbly and finds Wan-Bissaka, whose cross deflects behind for a corner. United\u2019s set-pieces have been poor tonight. 85 min \u201cI\u2019d prefer to see VAR quietly buried and never spoken of again,\u201d says Ciar\u00e1n McCabe. \u201cBut if it is here to stay, how about a time limit? If the VAR team cannot decide within 30 seconds of the incident with the aid of replays there was no clear and obvious error. Play on!\u201d I like the idea in principle, but I\u2019ve a feeling there would be unforeseeable fiascos. 84 min Wan-Bissaka is booked for blocking the ball with his shoulder. Jon Moss, the referee, hasn\u2019t had a great game. 82 min Traore beats Shaw yet again and swings a high cross towards Jota beyond the far post. He tries to head the ball back into the far corner but plants it straight at de Gea. 81 min Juan Mata replaces Jesse Lingard, who had a fair-to-mediocre game. At his best Lingard is a deceptively dangerous player, but he hasn\u2019t been at his best for a while now. 80 min Traore beats three players on a storming run before driving a dangerous low cross that is cleared by Lindelof. 79 min I certainly don\u2019t think Rashford bottled the penalty - he took one in a World Cup match, and also scored the winner against PSG. I suspect he is slightly in awe of Pogba and deferred to him. 78 min An execrable pass from Shaw gives Wolves the chance to break, but Wan-Bissaka makes an important interception. He\u2019s had an outstanding game. 77 min Rashford\u2019s curler from the edge of the box is blocked by Bennett, and then James - who has had a good second half - wins a corner. 75 min I did Pogba a disservice. What seems to have happened is this: Pogba picked the ball up, having won the penalty, and Rashford was happy for him to take it. It\u2019s still a load of nonsense, though, because Rashford is a far better penalty taker. 73 min Wolves are chasing not just a hat-trick of wins, but a hat-trick of 2-1 wins against Manchester United at Molineux this year. I don\u2019t think this game will end 1-1. 72 min \u201cSurely VAR has got to bring in the equivalent of the \u2018umpire\u2019s call\u2019 rule in cricket - either that or hire an anatomist to decide where a shoulder becomes an arm,\u201d says Dan C. \u201cThe theatre of the Neves goal was ruined by 2 minutes watching someone move a line a few pixels back and forth, it\u2019s kind of pathetic.\u201d I\u2019d get rid of the whole sorry shambles. But assuming we are stuck with it, they should definitely introduce something like that for offsides. 70 min James scurries into the box and has a shot blocked by Coady. This has been a cracking second half. 69 min I would suggest that Gary Neville\u2019s views on that penalty may be worth watching after the game. It seems Pogba pulled rank on Rashford, even though Rashford is a much better penalty taker. 68 min Nice one, Paul. He bulleted the penalty towards goal, and Patricio flew to his right to beat it away. It wasn\u2019t a terrible penalty, but it was at a saveable height. And when you pull a stunt like, you\u2019d better score. Marcus Rashford took the penalty last week - but Pogba is going to take this. 67 min Coady is penalised for fouling Pogba, and there are no complaints. 67 min Bennett is booked for an inept challenge on Rashford, who\u2019d skinned him on the break. 65 min United have responded reasonably well to the equaliser, and are having a lot of the ball again. But they look much less composed than they did in the first half, both with and without the ball. 63 min Rashford tries to score from a ludicrous angle and distance on the left, and cracks it miles wide of the near post. \u201cWhat the bloody blazes was that?\u201d chant the Wolves fans. 62 min The primal roar when Neves scored was a thing of beauty. 61 min McTominay has a crack from 25 yards; Moutinho blocks. 59 min Traore dances into the area from the right before dragging a left-footed shot well wide. Wolves are all over United, who must be starting to wonder whether it\u2019s happening again. The goal is given! And it\u2019s worth repeating that it was a storming goal. Moutinho may have been offside when the corner was played back to him, after which he drilled it to Neves on the edge of the area. VAR check for offside Oh lord. That was a stunning goal. Moutinho took a short corner on the right and hammered the ball back towards Neves, in space on the edge of the area. As the United players charged out, Neves got the ball out of his feet in a hurry and smacked a gorgeous, booming curler that brushed the fingertip of the stretching de Gea and flew in off the underside of the bar. It hit the back of the net and then bounced back up onto the underside of the bar on its way out. Great goal. What a goal from Ruben Neves! 54 min: Jimenez hits the post! It was a brilliant effort, a flicked header at the near post from Moutinho\u2019s outswinging free-kick. It clattered of the inside of the post, hit De Gea and bounced to safety. 54 min Traore is fouled just outside the area by Maguire, who isn\u2019t impressed with the decision. 52 min After a patient passing move from United, Wan-Bissaka shapes to shoot and then plays a disguised through pass that just evades Lingard in the area. Wan-Bissaka has been the best player on the pitch so far, for mine. 51 min Neves is booked for a foul on James. 50 min Wolves have made a much faster start to the second half - but they almost go 2-0 down when Lingard completely miskicks an inviting cross from Wan-Bissaka. It was a slightly awkward ball, which bounced in front of him, and he shanked it completely. 47 min James slips and plants his studs into Jota\u2019s ankle. He\u2019s on a yellow card, so he needs to be careful. I think that was an accident; if not, he\u2019s lucky to be on the pitch. 46 min Peep peep! The second half is underway. Wolves have made a change, with Traore replacing Doherty. Half-time reading Peep peep! Manchester United deservedly lead through Anthony Martial\u2019s excellent goal in the 27th minute. That was their only real chance, but they dominated possession throughout and played with confidence and authority. Wolves can play better, though, and probably will in the second half. 45+1 min Martial almost gets a second on the stroke of half-time. He scooted onto a half-arsed backpass from Bennett, pushed the ball away from the last man Boly with his right foot - but his left foot landed on the ball and sent it spinning behind him. 44 min Wan-Bissaka is having a cracking game at right-back. He looks so hard to beat one against one. 42 min James\u2019 clipped cross is chested down near the penalty spot by Martial, but he can\u2019t find any room for a shot at goal. 41 min Shaw shows surprising pace to scoot past Doherty and win a corner. Rashford\u2019s inswinger is headed back across goal by Maguire and eventually cleared. 39 min Pogba is penalised for a foul on Moutinho. There\u2019s a VAR check to see whether Pogba deserves to be sent off. He doesn\u2019t; it was just a tangle of legs. 37 min Wolves had a little flurry of possession after the goal but United have resumed control for the last five minutes. 36 min Rashford sweeps a sharp pass into Martial on the edge of the D. He turns smartly and wriggles away from Boly but not the last man Coady. 35 min Pogba plays a lovely pass down the right to James, whose first-time cross is intercepted by the stretching Coady. James is being booed, with feeling, every time he gets the ball. He\u2019s looked slightly nervous in possession, but his work rate without the ball has been impressive. 33 min We\u2019ve seen almost nothing of Ruben Neves so far. 32 min Moutinho\u2019s corner rebounds to Jimenez, whose stinging snapshot is blocked by Pogba. 31 min Human nature being what it is, Wolves have had much more of the ball since the goal. Jota wins a corner off Wan-Bissaka. After 27 minutes of probing, United finally got behind Wolves for the first time. Lingard pushed the ball infield from the left to Rashford, who slid a nice short pass down the side of the defence into the path of Martial. He ran away from Boly and crashed a rising shot past Patricio with his left foot. Anthony Martial gives Manchester United the lead with a thumping finish. 25 min Lindelof shanks the ball towards his own goal, but redeems his error with a header back to De Gea. It\u2019s an interesting game, but not yet an exciting one. 24 min Dan James has been booked for diving. That looked a good decision from Jon Moss, although replays suggest he might have been caught. It\u2019s hard to be sure. What we do know is that he\u2019s going to be booed for the rest of the game. 23 min \u201cGiven both teams\u2019 strengths on the counter,\u201d says Oliver Atkinson, \u201cthis feels like the sort of game where Wolves are having the better of it on account of United having all of the ball.\u201d Yes, Wolves have looked the slightly more dangerous team, even though they\u2019ve only had about a quarter of the possession. 19 min Here\u2019s Sean Clayton on the subject of bogey teams. \u201cIt feels like a long time ago but Sheffield Wednesday absolutely owned Man United for several seasons in the late 80s and early 90s. In retrospect, that late brace of injury time goals by Steve Bruce was the beginning of a long decline for the mighty Owls...\u201d Nigel bloody Jemson. 18 min Pogba sprays a long crossfield pass to Rashford on the left. He twists Bennett one way and then the other before curling a wicked inswinging cross that just evades Martial in the six-yard box. 18 min Wan-Bissaka makes a good tackle to stop Jota\u2019s run down the left. Jimenez and Jota look really sharp on the counter-attack. 16 min Pogba fouls Jota 40 yards from goalk. Moutinho\u2019s inswinging free-kick is headed away by Harry Magnet. 14 min United are struggling to get behind the Wolves defence, which is so well organised. There\u2019s so much pace in this United team, but there isn\u2019t. Pogba excepted, a huge amount of guile. 12 min Under normal circumstances you\u2019d say this has been an excellent start for United, who have dominated possession (72 per cent) and played with breezy purpose. But given their recent history with Wolves, they might wonder whether they are walking into a trap. 10 min \u201cObviously, I\u2019m no United fan,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201c But I am a very big admirer of Dan James. He is terrifyingly fast, with a decent end product, and just seems like such a damn nice young man. I\u2019m looking forward to watching him tear up trees for Wales, and hoping he gets the chance to develop at United. And, you would need a heart of stone not to smile at the sheer, unadulterated, childlike joy in his goal celebration last week. Go on, son.\u201d 10 min Shaw\u2019s corner is headed clear at the far post. 9 min Now it\u2019s United\u2019s turn to counter, from that Wolves corner, and James wins a corner at the other end. 9 min The corner is slabheaded away by Maguire. 8 min James loses the ball on the right - I thought he was fouled, but Jon Moss didn\u2019t - and Wolves spring forward to win a corner at the other end. 5 min United have had almost all of the ball in the first five minutes, though Wolves won\u2019t really mind that. They are lethal on the break. 3 min \u201cI like Lingard, he\u2019s a decent player who always puts in a shift,\u201d says Sandile Xaso, \u201cbut how much better would this team look with a class act like James Maddison in it? It was startling to see him not only be the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge yesterday, but by such a large margin.\u201d Yes, I really like Maddison, who looks a class act. I suspect he will have a lot of suitors next summer. 2 min A couple of lively early challenges, first from McTominay and then Coady. Both were fair tackles, but they were also meaningful. 1 min Peep peep! Wolves, in the old gold, kick off from right to left. United are in red. We\u2019re having a few technical issues, but they\u2019ll hopefully be sorted before kick-off. The players have just emerged to the usual cracking atmosphere. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks \u201c[Dan James] has made an impact from day one. We\u2019ll chop and change at times this season. Andreas played very well last week but we think Dan is the right choice for tonight. He gives us the X-factor of his pace, and he\u2019s incredibly hard working off the ball. \u201cThis is not a happy hunting ground for me \u2013 three games here [as a player and manager], three defeats. I was thinking of staying at home tonight! We know Wolverhampton are a tough side; they maybe deserved more than finishing seventh last season. We know they don\u2019t concede many goals and we\u2019ll have to be clinical when we get chances.\u201d \u201cDo you know if the average age of this United team remains the youngest in this week\u2019s round of PL fixtures?\u201d says Matt Richman. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m impressed with the repeated faith in the team\u2019s youth.\u201d It is, yeah. It\u2019s also slightly younger than the Chelsea team, with James (21) replacing Pereira (23). Nuno Espirito Santo speaks \u201cIt\u2019s a big game, a big challenge for us. We did a lot of things well against them last season. I expect a tough game \u2013 they are confident, so we have to take care of everything and look for our chance. The answer of the players has been very good [to the extra workload]. The idea is to be united and embrace everything in front of us.\u201d Some pre-match reading Daniel James makes his full debut for United, replacing Andreas Pereira. Wolves are unchanged from their last Premier League game, the 0-0 draw at Leicester eight days ago. Wolves (3-5-2) Patricio; Bennett, Coady, Boly; Doherty, Dendoncker, Neves, Moutinho, Jonny; Jimenez, Jota. Substitutes: Ruddy, Vinagre, Gibbs-White, Saiss, Neto, Cutrone, Traore. Manchester United (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw; McTominay, Pogba; James, Lingard, Rashford; Martial. Substitutes: Romero, Young, Tuanzebe, Mata, Pereira, Matic, Greenwood. Referee Jon Moss. Hello. Manchester United have had some unlikely bogey teams down the years. West Brom in the late 1970s; Norwich in the late 1980s; Southampton in the mid 1990s; Middlesbrough in the early 2000s; just about everyone since 2013. Their newest nemesis is Wolves, who tonight are aiming to beat United at Molineux for the third time in less than six months. Their two 2-1 wins last season \u2013 one in the FA Cup, one in the league \u2013 sent United into a tailspin after that amazing start under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They showed the first signs of recovery with a stirring 4-0 win over Chelsea last weekend, but this is a different - and arguably tougher - test. In those two games last season, Wolves dictated the match by not dictating it \u2013 both teams prefer to play on the counter-attack, and Wolves had less of the ball each time. They rode their luck a little in the league, but the FA Cup performance was a masterclass in playing like the away side at home. They will use exactly the same tactics tonight. It\u2019s up to United to do something about it. Kick off is at 8pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
