Google told its staff of approximately 100,000 last week that the employees were fired for \u201cclear and repeated violations of our data security policies\u201d, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. But in defiant interviews with the Guardian on Monday, the workers rejected that justification as a pretext. \u201cGoogle fired us not just to target us, but to send a message to other employees in the company,\u201d said Sophie Waldman, one of the fired software engineers. \u201cIt\u2019s not about us, but intimidating everyone else,\u201d added Laurence Berland, another of the fired Googlers. \u201cThey want us afraid, they want us resigned, and they want us cynical.\u201d A Google spokeswoman said: \u201cWe dismissed four individuals who were engaged in intentional and often repeated violations of our longstanding data security policies, including systematically accessing and disseminating other employees\u2019 materials and work. No one has been dismissed for raising concerns or debating the company\u2019s activities.\u201d The four will file charges known as unfair labor practices (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board, the government agency tasked with enforcing US labor law. US law generally prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for engaging in collective activity around their working conditions. The firings represent a serious escalation in long simmering labor unrest at Google, which has seen growing discontent from employees over issues such as the corporate response to sexual harassment, the treatment of the vast \u201cshadow workforce\u201d of temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs), and the ethics of some of Google\u2019s projects and clients. The firings were announced less than a week after the New York Times revealed that Google had hired an anti-union consulting firm. While employee activism at Google has burst into the public view over the past two years, it has long been a tradition at the company, the fired workers said. The company\u2019s code of conduct concludes with a statement that many Googlers take to heart, \u201cAnd remember \u2026 don\u2019t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn\u2019t right \u2013 speak up!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we were doing,\u201d said Waldman, who was involved in a petition calling on Google not to provide services to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). \u201cWe used to be able to engage in these issues and give feedback,\u201d said Berland. \u201cAt some point that stopped,\u201d he said. Paul Duke, another of the fired employees who had been at Google for more than eight years, said he believes Google has become less willing to engage with employees\u2019 objections to company decisions. \u201cThe company at one time was willing to listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understood that their employees were their best assets; they took feedback. Now, Google is no longer listening to its employees. It\u2019s consolidating power.\u201d Three of the fired workers \u2013 Berland, Waldman and Rebecca Rivers \u2013 identify as LGBT, and some of their activism involved organizing within employee resource groups (ERGs) for trans or gay Googlers to push the company on issues such as equal benefits for same-sex partnerships. \u201cFrom the beginning, queer and trans people at Google have banded together to make sure we have great benefits and a strong community,\u201d said Waldman. \u201cA lot of us feel very directly that it\u2019s us and people like us that are on the line\u201d when it comes to the company\u2019s ethical decisions. Berland recalled successful efforts organizing with other \u201cGayglers\u201d for equal health insurance benefits for same-sex partners before gay marriage was legalized across the US. \u201cBack then, the results of our workplace organizing were successes,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember a time when we got real wins from our employer.\u201d Now, much of the goodwill has been broken. \u201cGoogle is a lovely place to work if you are transgender and don\u2019t care about what is going on in the world,\u201d said Waldman. Rivers said that she first got involved in activism at Google when the company appointed Kay Coles James, the president of the Heritage Foundation who has a track record of fighting trans rights and LGBT protections, to its AI ethics council. At a public protest just days before her firing, Rivers told the 200 Googlers who rallied in opposition to her suspension that Google had wiped her personal phone when it suspended her, erasing many months of photographs documenting her gender transition. The fired workers said that they plan to continue their activism. After he was fired, Duke said, the first response he heard from co-workers was, \u201cWe need a union.\u201d \u201cThe faith hasn\u2019t been broken with all of the workers, it\u2019s been broken with executives,\u201d said Berland. \u201cPeople are more geared up and ready to fight. We\u2019re all going to continue to fight and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
