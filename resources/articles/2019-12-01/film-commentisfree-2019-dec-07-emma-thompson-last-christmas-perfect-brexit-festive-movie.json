I\u2019m all right, Emma. Keep it for yourself. Last Christmas is one of those films that is so deranged it feels like a strange fever dream. In this sense, it\u2019s like the 80s comedy Mannequin, a charming romantic comedy about a man finding true love with a plastic doll. Or maybe it\u2019s closer to Soul Man \u2013 another movie, like Last Christmas, that ruined a good song by stealing its title \u2013 in which a white kid takes a load of tanning pills in order to baggsie a Harvard scholarship for African Americans. Yes, this is a movie that actually exists. Unlike Soul Man, Last Christmas does not feature \u201ccomedy\u201d blackface. But on the bus home afterwards, I had a debate with myself about which was its most bonkers moment: Thompson casting herself as a depressed former Yugoslavian immigrant? The faintly depressing onslaught of cameos from people who are really too good for the script? (Patti LuPone, for God\u2019s sake. Patti LuPone.) In fact, never mind Soul Man, Last Christmas is more reminiscent of those bewildering comedies that were once the mainstay of the British film industry before Four Weddings And A Funeral made everyone up their game. Ever seen Wilt, starring Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith? Or Blame It On The Bellboy, featuring Dudley Moore, Richard Griffiths and Patsy Kensit? No? Don\u2019t worry too much about it. And then there\u2019s the plot twist. Regular readers will know that I have very strong feelings about what constitutes a good Christmas movie, and I have similarly firm ideas about plot twists. A good twist will make everything in the movie come together. A bad one makes the entire film fall apart. Despite Last Christmas\u2019 best attempts to copy the \u201cChazz Palminteri dropping his coffee cup as he realises the truth about Keyser S\u00f6ze\u201d moment in The Usual Suspects, you cannot jazzhands away the fact that the plot twist is the most ludicrously WTF moment in a film since Donald Trump strolled up to have a chat with Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2. And yet, Last Christmas is the No 1 movie in Britain. That\u2019s right, a film best described as \u201cThe Sixth Sense, directed by Richard Curtis on ketamine\u201d is the one everyone wants to see. It\u2019s never a good look for journalists to express bewilderment about the choices of the general public, whether that\u2019s political parties or Christmas movies. It\u2019s the writer\u2019s job to find out why people feel the way they do, not to sneer at them for not feeling otherwise, and I reckon that the success of Last Christmas says quite a lot about Britain 2019. Most obviously, this will be a pretty depressing Christmas. Not in your home, which I\u2019m sure will be lovely. But we\u2019ve had three and a half years of a political hellscape and it\u2019s unlikely anyone\u2019s going to be feeling any less exhausted after this godforsaken election. So I blame no one for seeking light escapism in a movie about a woman permanently dressed as an elf. Is that really more mad than anything Jacob Rees-Mogg says or, for that matter, wears? Jukebox stage musicals, in which a musician\u2019s oeuvre is hung around the most dubious of plots, have been joined by jukebox movies, with Last Christmas (which pillages poor George Michael\u2019s back catalogue) following in the lucrative steps of Mamma Mia!, Bohemian Rhapsody, Yesterday and Rocketman. Jukebox movies are the ultimate populist movies, in that the people love them and the elites \u2013 the critics \u2013 hate them. It\u2019s this that makes Last Christmas the perfect Brexit Christmas movie. Thompson would, I suspect, be horrified to hear that, given the way she shoehorns her dislike of Brexit into the movie. But, like Brexit, everyone comes out of Last Christmas badly. Once, Thompson wrote Sense And Sensibility, possibly the greatest film adaptation of all time. Now she literalises Wham! lyrics. Similarly, I am \u2013 as I may have mentioned once or a million times before \u2013 no fan of Love, Actually, but not even I can deny that film\u2019s magnitude and glossiness. Next to that, Last Christmas looks second-rate, absurd, inexplicable. A bit like Britain after Brexit, in other words. Last Christmas is us. It would be bizarre, right now, to release a big shiny movie about the perfection of Christmas, because no one in this country is feeling big, shiny or perfect. We\u2019re feeling small and confused, and Last Christmas is small and confusing. I saw it on a rainy night, and at first I could sense the confusion among the audience. But when the twist was revealed, we all burst out laughing. God, it felt good: the first moment of collective connection many of us had felt with our fellow citizens for a while. So thank you, Last Christmas, for showing us who we are, and for allowing us to laugh at ourselves. Whether you meant to or not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
