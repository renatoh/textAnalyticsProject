He writes about the \u2018squalid and grim\u2019 reality of the precarious life of Trevor Young, 30, a farm labourer, and his wife, Jenny, despite living in a picture-postcard thatched cottage. \u2018There isn\u2019t a thing in my wardrobe that didn\u2019t come from a jumble sale,\u2019 says Jenny. \u2018I make a daily list of shopping, and I daren\u2019t go a penny over it.\u2019 Trevor was as unflinchingly honest: \u2018You\u2019re just like a piece of machinery to the guv\u2019nor. I\u2019ve heard about one bloke being carried out on a stretcher after an accident \u2013 and the farmer just put his cards on his chest.\u2019 Bill Mahon, 48, started working as a miner when he was 14. On day shifts he was up at 4am and at the bottom of the pit by 5.45am. Both his sons followed him into the same work. \u2018There is more than resigned acceptance in this seemingly inevitable progress of the local youth to the pit,\u2019 says Hopcraft. The pit is their life, they say: \u2018Nearly all we talk about in the club is the pit. There\u2019s not much talk anywhere about politics or the unions.\u2019 Hopcraft ends with the similarly narrow horizons of factory worker Eileen and alludes to the coping mechanism of alcohol: \u2018She has been to several nightclubs in Manchester. Her favourite drink is Tia Maria and she also likes cherry brandy, sherry, and port and lemon. Stuart [her boyfriend] drinks pints of bitter.\u2019 The possibility of escape feels remote and Eileen sounds understandably depressed. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t mind leaving Oldham altogether,\u2019 she says. \u2018There\u2019s nothing here, really. But I don\u2019t suppose we will.\u2019 And even if she wanted to talk about it, there were class differences. \u2018The middle class get psychotherapy,\u2019 concluded one psychiatrist rather pithily, \u2018and the working class get pills.\u2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
