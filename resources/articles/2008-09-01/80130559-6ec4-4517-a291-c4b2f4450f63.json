Now Ian Hislop and Paul Merton are to go head to head in the battle for viewers as they front rival documentary series for BBC4. Executives at the digital service said both would become key figures as the channel attempted to build on recent successes and establish a closer working relationship with BBC2. Merton, who previously presented a series on silent cinema for the channel, will examine Alfred Hitchcock's early pictures. Ian Hislop Goes Off the Rails, part of a Golden Age of Steam season, will appraise the impact of the 1963 Beeching report, which led to swingeing cuts and the closure of many rural lines and stations. As he travels along ghost lines and through overgrown stations, Hislop will examine whether Beeching's solution was necessary to save the transport system or a ruthless attack on industry and culture. BBC4 has enjoyed some success in bringing viewers to its themed seasons and science programming will be a particular focus this autumn. Its controller, Janice Hadlow, who is seen as a leading contender to replace Roly Keating as controller of BBC2 when he moves to oversee the BBC Archive this year, said the channel was \"proud to be passionate about challenging subjects\". The child psychologist, Laverne Antrobus, will examine the development of babies before and after birth in Growing Babies, while Professor Jim Al-Khalili will trace the lives and achievements of scientists in the medieval Islamic world in Science and Islam. Another mini-season will mark 100 years since Mills &amp; Boon published its first bodice-ripper. A drama starring Jodie Whittaker and Patrick Baladi will tell the story behind the birth of the publisher, while the novelist Stella Duffy will try her hand at writing a Mills &amp; Boon novel. Hadlow is considered to have done a good job at BBC4, with a mix of intelligent drama, comedy, documentary and acquisitions such as Mad Men and Flight of the Conchords, both of which will return."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
