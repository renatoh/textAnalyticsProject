I walked the whole thing. It ends in the town of Santiago de Compostela, where you stay in a huge former monastery. It was lovely. Glastonbury feels like an extension of that, because you\u2019re walking all the time. I went to my first Glastonbury in the 80s but I don\u2019t remember who the main acts were, or even if I had a good time. That was kind of irrelevant back then. You just sort of took off on these suicide missions. That would destroy me now. I can\u2019t go full-on nuts any more. These days, I\u2019ll have some red wine, meet some friends, have some posh food. There is something distinctly British about Glastonbury, but then there\u2019s something distinctly British about music festivals. You don\u2019t really have anything like it in America. They\u2019ve tried to get them to catch on, but they are for local people, always in or near cities and people mostly go home at night or stay in hotels. I\u2019ve been to them all \u2013 Coachella, that big one in Chicago. They\u2019re a bit like American football: couples and families go along together. Britain really knows how to do festivals. I love the way you can bump into a bunch of lassies and it feels like a hen party, or a bunch of guys behaving like they\u2019re in Ibiza. You do get families, though, and there\u2019s stuff for them. That\u2019s the beauty. You just sort of build a city in the middle of a field and make your own rules. It\u2019s utopian postindustrial life as it should be \u2013 a guide to where we are going. I am DJing this year. Glastonbury isn\u2019t chin-strokey. It\u2019s party tunes, everyone having a good time. I play Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, some Donna Summer remixes, Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way. Make it upbeat, make it party, make it fun, and close with Born Slippy, one of the best tunes ever. Glastonbury really comes alive when the bands are finished. That\u2019s when I like it most, when all these mad acid house clubs get going. There\u2019s millions of them, I forget their names. I was going to see the Proclaimers this year but they were on too early, at midday. I\u2019m just going to bed then.
