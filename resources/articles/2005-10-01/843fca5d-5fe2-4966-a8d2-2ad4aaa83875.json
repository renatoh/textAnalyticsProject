But last month, newspaper publishers outdid themselves on the seduction front with DVDs, recipe books and extra helpings of Sudoku puzzles as the relaunch of the Guardian in its new, smaller format forced its rivals on to the offensive. Their efforts have paid off, with all the quality daily papers enjoying month-on-month sales rises and between them they sold a total of 70,000 more copies than in September 2004, according to September figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Combined sales of the Guardian, the Times, the Daily Telegraph, the Independent and the Financial Times increased by 2.6% year-on-year in September, a remarkable feat in a market that is shrinking rapidly in every developed market in the world. That coincided with a decline in sales for all the popular dailies in September, traditionally the month in which newspaper circulation directors breathe a sight of relief as readers return from their holidays and the evenings start to draw in. The Guardian, which last month became the first national newspaper in the UK to publish in the Berliner format used by several continental papers including Le Monde, enjoyed a 7% year-on-year sales boost to 404,187 (with bulks included). Carolyn McCall, chief executive of Guardian Newspapers Ltd, said the performance had exceeded the Guardian's expectations and indicated that the paper's sales for October - its first full month in the Berliner format - will also show a significant rise. The figure takes the Guardian above the psychologically significant 400,000 mark for the first time since March 2003 and reverses the steady decline that accelerated in November of that year after the relaunch of the Independent and the Times as tabloid. It compares with sales of just 341,968 copies in August, the newspaper's lowest ever average monthly sale. The relaunches of the Independent and the Times two years ago took their rivals by surprise. But the Guardian's plan to become the first British national newspaper to publish in the Berliner format had been well signposted, and its competitors were prepared. The Times revamped its T2 features section, making it more female-friendly, while the Independent had its new Bridget Jones column and - at the other end of the spectrum - a serialisation of a new book by its respected Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk. The Times's ABC figure was up at 699,425, nearly 6% up on the figure for September 2004, while sales of the Independent fell by less than 1% year-on-year to 262,552. The Daily Telegraph, which delayed its relaunch until earlier this month, also held steady at 904,283. But the main driver behind the sales increases were the Saturday editions, a discrepancy the ABC's statistics disguise by averaging out Monday to Saturday sales. All four mainstream quality dailies spent heavily on promotion last month, with Guardian readers treated to a DVD of The Madness of King George and a sneak preview of Jamie Oliver's new recipe book and Telegraph readers enjoying yet more Helen Mirren in the form of a Prime Suspect DVD. The Independent treated its Saturday readers to a Sudoku CD-rom and a Swimming with Sharks DVD, and anyone buying the Times got a DVD of Moby Dick. Only the Financial Times held out against the temptation to pull readers in with the lure of a freebie. At the other end of the market, sales of the red-top papers proved immune to the traditional September fillip. The Daily Mirror, the Daily Record, the Daily Star and the Sun were all down on their August figures and not even the Daily Mirror's Kate Moss scoop could break the pattern, although the paper does appear to be over the worst of its declines. Sales of the Mirror were 3% down year-on-year at 1.74m, slightly down on the August figure. The Sun was down 1% on September 2004 at 3.3m. But Richard Desmond's Express suffered the worst of the declines, down a worrying 13% year-on-year, the biggest fall of all the popular papers. Even Jordan's wedding, it seems, was not enough to pull the readers back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
