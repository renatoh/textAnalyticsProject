The former managing director of Go North East fell 200ft on Sunday afternoon near Blea Water, the deepest mountain tarn in the national park which is overlooked by steep crags. He was getting fit for a planned fund-raising expedition to the North Pole when he lost his footing in snow on the path from the summit of High Street, the 828m (2718ft) mountain topped by a Roman road which lies between Ullswater and Haweswater in the eastern Lakes. A team from Penrith mountain rescue tried to save the 55-year-old with medical care at the scene, which was hard to reach because of the conditions. Although it was a bright day, the snow and ice at high levels made access difficult and potentially dangerous for the rescuers. But he died at 4pm. He left GNE in December after six years which saw the company's fortunes turned round and earned him a formidable reputation among his staff, customers and in the UK transport industry more widely. He was contemplating new challenges at the time of his death. A statement from the company said: It is with great sadness that we confirm the tragic death of former managing director Peter Huntley. This has come as a great shock to all his former colleagues. Above all Peter was a lover of life and lived it to the full. He will be sadly missed by us all. A Tweet from Bus Users UK said: Shocked and saddened to hear about the death of former Go North East MD Peter Huntley. One of the bus industry's true forward thinkers. And tributes on GNE's Facebook page included: Tragic news. Peter made what GNE is today, with bright and colourful buses, we should now have a bus with his name blazed across the front. R.I.P. Huntley, who lived in Preston, was a lifelong enthusiast for public transport, co-founding the magazine Transport Today in 1989 and a specialist transport consultancy, TAS, which is one of the most highly-rated in the country. He worked in local authority transport in Hartlepool, Grampian and Lancashire before taking on the challenge at GNE, while remaining chair of TAS and helping it become an employee-owned firm. He was a keen walker, climber and cyclist and an imaginative charitable fundraiser. Among the many organisations which benefited was the North West Air Ambulance which was involved in the attempt to save him. He also recently backed Barnados' North East Poverty Declaration, saying: Young people form a key part of our customer base and, in more ways than one, represent the future of our region. It is essential that they and their parents, are able to access opportunities for education, health, leisure, employment and social contact. From ensuring easy access for baby buggies to providing cheap travel for all those under 18, Go North East strives to recognise its responsibilities to families and children. Mobility is a critical part of avoiding poverty and buses are essential in providing mobility for many families. We are proud to commit to reducing child poverty in North East England. He had been aiming to raise \u00a310,000 for Transaid, the national transport charity, by trekking to the Arctic circle from Russia in two months' time. He was walking with a former colleague from TAS, John Taylor. Another friend an TAS director Chris Cheek said: Our only consolation is that he was doing something he loved on a beautiful day, full of plans and optimism for the future. His family and the Coroner have been informed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
