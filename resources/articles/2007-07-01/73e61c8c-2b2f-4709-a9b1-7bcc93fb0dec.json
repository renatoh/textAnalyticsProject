People feel strongly about The Sopranos, the television show that lasted eight years and showed us that gangsters are just ordinary people with extraordinarily large fridges, therapy, little league, interior decorators, problems managing and motivating staff, and an excellent record in debt recovery. The final series is yet to be shown on British TV but in the US it's all over and Tony is ... but I mustn't give the game away. Before the final episode was seen by American audiences there was a buzz about the finale. The Guardian published two pieces, one before and one after the final programme, which was shown to US audiences on June 10. Our New York correspondent wrote them. He told me: \"I know there's a huge interest in The Sopranos back home - it was a story we had to do because there was such a head of steam over here in America about it. The question was: how to write about it without giving anything away?\" The first article reported on speculation about the last episode. The journalist indulged in some speculation of his own, \"Will [Tony] take a leaf out of his son's book?\" he asked, recounting an incident that didn't spoil the ending but gave another bit of the game away to British viewers who don't yet know what happened to Tony's son. This was accompanied by a photograph - a scene from the final series, but not the last episode, showing Tony sitting on a bench. In hospital? In custody? It wasn't clear what he was doing, but some readers were extremely annoyed. One sent this short, Soprano-style message: \"That picture on page 19 today. You tossers.\" I don't think he was joking. The second article reported US audience reaction to the final episode. The Guardian's New York correspondent didn't want to ruin things for fans. He wrote, \"to describe why Chase [the director] inspired such virulent reactions in his usually devoted fan base would give away the ending for those who have not yet seen it\". But the article was accompanied by what appeared, at first glance, to be a screen grab of a funeral scene with rows of people looking at a picture of Tony lying in a coffin. There were complaints about this and two days later the paper published a letter, which said: \"Why oh why show a picture of Tony Soprano in a coffin if you didn't want to give away the ending? May you swim with the fishes.\" I'm pretty sure that was ironic. The letter made Guardian columnist Jon Ronson very cross. He emailed: \"So there's a letter in today's Guardian in which a reader criticises the paper for giving away the ending of The Sopranos. And the letter gives away the ending! So the Guardian has now given away the ending twice, which is great for someone like me who missed the first spoiler but - to my dismay - has today caught the second one. It is unbelievably stupid and annoying!\" On closer inspection the picture was less clear. As someone pointed out in a letter we published two days later, \"Tony Soprano is probably not in a coffin. He is casually dressed, so he may be having a postprandial nap.\" The pictures editor explained that we hadn't in fact shown Tony's funeral: there was no caption and readers might have been less annoyed if they'd been told that what they were looking at was a picture of US fans watching the final episode in a cafe. I spoke to the deputy letters editor, who told me that the letters desk made sure that the \"coffin letter\" didn't take things beyond speculation. They followed up with another letter, two days later, from a reader in Los Angeles, which said, \"That Tony Soprano pic is a still from a dream sequence. Not saying what happens - but the Guardian didn't squeal.\" So it was all a dream. Hang on, wasn't that how they ended a series of Dallas (when Bobby Ewing was killed in a hit-and-run and reappeared, alive and well, in the next series)? I hope that clears things up without spoiling anyone's fun. reader@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
