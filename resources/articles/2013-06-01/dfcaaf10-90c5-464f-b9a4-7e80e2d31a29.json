You don't half go on, eh? I know, bloody hell, I was surprised there wasn't any pictures. I thought they would put a few in but they didn't want to. It started off as something I was going to do at Palace, about me and looking behind the scenes of how managers cope with different problems, but when they went into administration, all of a sudden I found I had even more problems. I thought, well, I'll put it in writing and then I went from the frying pan into the fire at QPR, with all the things that were happening there. You should have stayed up north and well away from the Big Smoke. Ha! I always thought if you went below Watford it was the pits, the end of the world. But I went to Crystal Palace and QPR and absolutely loved London \u2026 I never realised how beautiful and interesting it is. Cycling round Richmond Park \u2026 it's amazing. I really don't regret a single thing now about leaving Sheffield United because I've had so many experiences since. HQ for the Warnock family is in Cornwall, which is a mite more peaceful than London. Oh, I love Cornwall, it's so special. We bought the house when I was with Plymouth Argyle and we've just kept that on and kept modernising things. It's a lovely part of the world, really \u2026 you want your kids to grow up in Cornwall if they can. The number of professional people that retire there is ridiculous. I don't think you can put a price on coming out of the rat race and living in a place like that. Are you out of the rat race now? You didn't seem quite sure at the end of the book. Yeah, I think 24 hours a day I am. Last week I went to Scotland with the kids and the phone never went football-wise. When I woke up in the night I wasn't thinking about agents or different managers, or players I was signing or selling, or whether I was talking to directors about getting different players or pre-season friendlies. I was just thinking that we were going quad-biking the next day, or we were going fly-fishing or canoeing. It was great. But \u2026 But I'm sure when the fixtures come out I'll start thinking of how we beat Tottenham in the Cup last year. Knowing you've beat a club with Gareth Bale and Aaron Lennon and the satisfaction your fans have got. When that final whistle goes, it's hard to see how you'll replicate that. I still think there might be a role for me at a club between the manager and the directors or the new owners, as there's so many coming into the game now. There's got to be a role for an experienced football person helping the manager; not being a threat to the manager, but helping and sorting out a lot of the hassle he has, you know? Letting him concentrate on managing the football side. Ah now, you wouldn't be able to help yourself. Small Talk reckons you would stick your neb in and annoy him. A lot. [Laughs] No, I think I could take a back seat. A lot of clubs now are cutting back and thinking of the pennies and thinking that they don't need anybody else, but sometimes you've got to spend a bit more to win. I think there are so many clubs now where you've got people without any experience making big decisions \u2013 I worry for some of them. Back to the book, is it true you recorded the audio version yourself? Yes, I had to do! They sent me a copy of a chapter that they'd had done and it sounded to me like a young, Lancastrian actor telling my story. You can't re-tell my stories if you've got a Lancaster accent or you're under 25 or whatever. He sounded terrible and my wife Sharon said: 'You've got to do it! It's the last one you're going to do, it's the only one you're going to do!'. So I spent three days doing it and I don't regret it. I was doing the audio book and, at least four times when I was doing it, I got goose-pimples from reading my own book! An actor couldn't have a feeling like that from a book. I could feel, when I was talking, how important it was to me and so I was really pleased that I managed to get through it all. You probably wish it hadn't been 354 pages long with no pictures. The publisher told me after I'd finished that I was only contracted to do about 250 pages! The Great Gatsby is only about 180 pages long, nowhere near as entertaining and that's flying off the shelves at the moment. You could have saved yourself a lot of trouble. I know. Still, at least it's out for Father's Day. I've been signing a lot saying 'Happy Father's Day'. There's a quote on the cover from Harry Redknapp saying \"this book tells you what managing is really like\". Can you categorically confirm that Harry has read all 354 pages? I spoke to him about a few of the chapters and I know he's read some, but I won't tell you which ones. Small Talk can guess which ones the QPR manager has read. Yeah, ha-ha! And I think we just appreciate each other because he's had a great career as well, hasn't he? This book, it goes behind the scenes. I was hoping it might give everyone a sense of what it's like, 24 hours a day, to manage a club, even at Championship level. It's a very time-consuming job. Large tracts of the book seem to consist of you arguing with yourself over whether or not Adel Taarabt is a complete pain in the arse and you don't ever actually seem to reach a conclusion. Would his existence have been such a source of internal conflict if he was no good at football? If Adel was no good at football I wouldn't have touched him with a bargepole! But right from the start I made up my mind that I was going to have a go with this kid, which is unusual for me. Yes and you persevered and look where it got you: slung out on your ear. Adel's a lovely lad. You have to take him as you find him if you want to use him in your team and that's what we did in the end; we built a team around him. Will he ever come good? I think it's difficult for him in England. I think England was probably the wrong place for Adel. You get one or two bad results and people like Adel are always a target. I think they're an easy target because they have so much ability and if you don't get him in the right areas, he's not going to contribute much to the team. If he's not contributing to the team he is a bit of a passenger in that respect, so I think you have to be committed totally to having him in your team. At one point, things were going badly at QPR and you ended up in Richmond Park talking to a deer. What did you discuss? Yes, I was riding around on my mountain bike and its head just popped up and frightened me to death. It was a massive stag. Our eyes just sort of met and I said \"It's alright for you in here; you're not having to decide who you're going to drop on Saturday!\" It was things like that. Did he have any advice for you? No, he just stood there. He never ran away or anything, it was so amazing. I can see the funny side of it now but I didn't say anything at the time because people would have thought I was round the bend. But it was just appropriate at the time, you know? Talking to a stag in the park about my team selection. It was one of those moments that you don't forget. You had to get your own credit card out a lot as a manager at financially struggling clubs to pay for things like coach travel and, in one instance, a player's surgical procedure. What does Mrs Warnock make of this largesse? I don't think she knew until she read the book. If I'm honest, it wasn't something that I'd sort of \u2026 really, tell people. Especially Sharon. People might be surprised to read about that side of you. Yeah, look, it was important at the time, really, and I had to make quick decisions. You're a cricket buff: by what score will England win the Ashes series? I think probably one draw and three wins. I think the Aussies might win a Test. Will you be going to any of them? I'd like to think so, but it's difficult. Unless I get posh seats it's difficult going with Joe Public because I get pestered \u2013 they either don't like me or they love me! I'm like Marmite; love him or loathe him! It's difficult going to cricket matches. I went to The Oval with mates one night and it was okay until the rain came down. Everyone's drinking lagers except me, because I don't drink lager and all of a sudden there's 10 West Ham fans, there's 10 bloody Millwall fans, there's 10 Arsenal fans and you're in the middle of it. It does get a little bit nervewracking and hair-raising. Did you get any pleasure from seeing QPR relegated this season? None whatsoever. I've looked on with interest and I do wish that I'd been supported when I left, but I don't have any bitterness about that at all. They made a decision and I wouldn't want to be at a club where I'm not wanted. You settled a few scores in your book: the Palace administrator, Pascal Chimbonda, Gary Megson, Gary Johnson, Rob Styles and Graham Poll all got a little bit of flak. Was that fun? I think they've all spoken well of me in the past. I could've left them out but I didn't see any reason to. Most of the people you've mentioned have had a dig at me at some stage or another, but I keep my own counsel. I think there's a right place \u2013 they don't have to buy my book and they don't have to have anything to do with me. The people who buy my book will want to buy it and you can't have a book without some controversy. You claim to eat very healthily in the book and threaten to go on MasterChef some day. What three-course meal would you prepare to impress the judges? My three-course meal would be: smoked salmon with capers and a few prawns on there as well. Then it would be a dover sole grilled on the bone with a portion of green beans. And if I wasn't dieting or looking after myself, my favourite pudding would be bread and butter pudding with custard, ice cream and clotted cream all together! That sounds genuinely fantastic. Small Talk's mouth is watering. I know! When I'm out in a restaurant and they say would you like ice cream, clotted cream or ordinary cream, I always say 'Yes please!' You're going to need some guests around to eat this feast. Who would be your top four dinner party guests, alive or dead? Brian Clough would be one and I'd invite the Queen, because I've always been a royalist. Now, who else would I invite? You're going to need some eye candy \u2026 Eye candy? Some totty, Neil. Somebody nice to look at. Oh right, I'll have Barbra Streisand; I love Barbra Streisand. And I'd probably have Peter Kay too. I'd have Peter around for my dinner party because I like him and his humour and the way it doesn't go over the top language-wise; I think he's everybody's cup of tea. I just think he'd bring a little bit of humour to the table, although I'm not sure the Queen would like him. Doesn't matter, it's your dinner party. Yes, but I think she'd decline the invitation anyhow! I'd have to have a reserve for the Queen! Who would I have? Let me think \u2026 erm \u2026 no, I can't bloody think. As soon as you put the phone down I'll think of somebody. You have our number, Neil. Now, we know what the last book you wrote was, but what's the last book you read? Ian Holloway's autobiography. I do like reading autobiographies, if I'm honest. I've read a couple of Cloughie's books, and Kenny Dalglish and that kind. I don't really read much fiction. You're into Motown artists and forced the players at QPR to listen to them on the dressing room stereo. Who's your favourite? I love Lionel Richie, but Motown-wise I love Junior Walker and The Allstars, the Four Tops, The Isley Brothers \u2026 that type of era. They were all of my time really. How did they go down with the lads? Are Clint Hill and Shaun Derry big fans of The Commodores? Well, they had no option. I used to go in and they'd be listening to some of the headbanging stuff and I'd tell them \"Listen, you won't put this on in 50 years, say 'this was a song in my day' and bang your head, whereas you will put on How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You) by Marvin Gaye. Bloody hell, you'll remember that in 50 years because that's a song!\" You're a qualified chiropodist. Would you still know what to do if Small Talk pulled off our socks and asked you to treat our bunions? Oh yes, of course I would. I still do bits and bobs. My speciality was ingrowing toenails. I don't mind blowing my own trumpet \u2013 I was very good at them. I would look at one or two of the players when the physio saw something he wasn't sure about. We're in the shop and Small Talk is giving you 70p. Which bar of chocolate would you buy? Lately it's been a Bounty. I like the \u2026 not a Snickers \u2026 what do you call it? The Chunky? Not a Kit Kat, probably a Snickers. But I do like the Bounty, the blue one. While Small Talk was waiting for your call, we were idly perusing paparazzi snaps of Theo Walcott on his stag do in Las Vegas. Where did you go on your stag-do? Oh my god, I don't know. I can't remember having one. Oh, I do! I remember, we only went out the night before, not for a week like they do nowadays. About three or four of us just had a quiet drink. I had a good night but we never went too far away. It certainly wasn't Vegas; I've never been to Vegas. Small Talk has and we don't think you'd like it, all those slot machines pinging and ringing all the time, not to mention all those fat Americans stuffing their faces. And the heat, Neil \u2026 good god, the heat. Still, I'd like to go for a couple of days, just to have a look. Well, perhaps Theo will invite you next time he's over. Thanks for your time, Neil. No problem, Small Talk. \u2022 The Gaffer: The Trials and Tribulations of a Football Manager, by Neil Warnock is out now in hardback, paperback and on audio book. And Small Talk doesn't mind joining Harry Redknapp in saying it's a fascinating read that provides some great insights into the life of a football manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
