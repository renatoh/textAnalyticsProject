It's a maiden and England will have to come back tomorrow, don their face paint, and finish this match off. 84th over 232-6 More cheeky appealing from Gaffer and co, trying to claim a little deflection off the back of Laxman's bat which the poor umpire wouldn't have been able to see. Koertzen waves them off with distain. 83rd over 230-6 Laxman and Agarkar both nudge singles off Freddy. That is to say that they score single runs with cleverly-placed shots, not that they encountered the England all-rounder in a nightclub and stop him from pulling. I'm labouring now. 82nd over 228-6 Another good maiden from Giles. Almost claims Agarkar, caught at gully by Butcher, but umpire Koertzen adjudges that the ball came off pad, not bat. 81st over 228-6 Freddie gets battered all over the park by, er, Agarkar. Three boundaries are followed by another two runs, as the heretofore unexceptional bowler displays some real technique. Freddie, meanwhile, looks shattered. Must have been all that fielding earlier. 80th over 214-6 Jones again, but he appears to be losing it slightly. He pitches one bouncer too short which even Agarkar has no problem swatting for four. He then follows that with a wide, and the next ball gets hit straight down the ground again, this time by Agarkar. 79th over 205-6 A sweet sweet drive from Laxman splits two fielders and steams to the boundary. Two balls later and he switches the stroke flicking the wrists to drive the ball out to mid-wicket for four. The 200 is up which, if nothing else, is a nice round number. 78th over 192-6 Simon Jones comes back at the pavilion end and bowls a little loose and wide. Laxman drives his first ball back down the ground for three, and Aji Agarkar manages to keep up what for him, is an impressive innings (he has six, so you realise what kind of a batsman we're talking about) despite being done by the bounce two balls in a row.. 77th over 189-6 Another maiden for Giles whose line and length appears to be spot on. 76th over 189-6 Michael Vaughan gets in for a bit of wrist-spinning action. He's unlucky not to take Agarkar lbw after umpire Tiffin claims the ball was heading outside off-stump when it patently wasn't. In the film Carry on up the Khyber they use the word 'tiffin' as a code word for a bit of, you know, that. I wonder if this was in the mind of his wife when they got hitched. 75th over 185-6 Another maiden for Giles. Stewart goes for a comedy stumping and lets out a big \"ooh!\" when he knocks Laxman's bails off. Giles appears to find it amusing; it's pure Gaffer. 74th over 185-6 Hoggard's figures for this innings currently stand at 17-3, not bad at all. His pace and placement is seemingly unrelenting, and it might be better to keep it that way as the one deliberate slow ball in this over is cut by Laxman for four. 73rd over 181-6 Hussain brings the field in rather tight to put the pressure on Laxman, the last recognised batsman. Laxman seems a little troubled by this, opting to play with his pads once or twice too often for comfort. He does manage to get away one drive which is steaming for the boundary until intercepted inches from the rope by a rather athletic Freddie Flintoff. Does this bloke have a diet book he wants to flog? 72nd over 178-6 Hoggard hit for a boundary by Laxman. 71st over 174-6 My machine crashes. I swear heartily, then kick my desk, then slap the monitor. It doesn't make me feel better. Giles gives up some runs that's all I can tell you, but every other ball seems to produce a half-chance for the field. Alison, I have to point out that there is no way I could leave my desk. The thought of you migrating to Channel 4 would be bad enough, but the prospect of losing my job would be even worse. Plus, I plan to make the computer endure a whole world of pain before I leave. 70th over India 170-6 Hoggard strikes again taking the wicket of Ajay Ratra. A full length delivery tempted the wicketkeeper into giving a leading edge claimed by Mark Butcher in the gully with a diving two-handed catch that resembled a salmon picking somebody's pocket. 69th over India 170-5 Giles gives up just the one run to Laxman, and is getting a fair degree out of turn out of the pitch. 68th over India 169-5 Ratra comes to the crease and immediately Hoggard gets after him, forcing him into a defensive drive on his off-side that almost carries to Stewart. Alison Jeeves, you are indeed the only person in the office in the entire country. I'm not even in the office, I'm dictating my report from a sun lounger in Hastings (which also explains the brevity). 67th over India 169-5 Ashley Giles comes into the attack and tempts Dravid into shedding his wicket. A short ball, pitched just inside leg stump, spins away from the batsman and with an inside edge he crashes the ball back onto his stumps. Giles does a little jig to celebrate; it is rubbish. I wasn't joking about the ecosystem plan by the way. 66th over 165-4 And concocting a sinister plan to destroy the world's ecosystem! Meanwhile, Laxman lofts one from Hoggard. The cries go up but the ball eludes the chasing Vaughan and runs to the boundary. 65th over India 160-4 Now I am dressing up in women's clothing! 64th over India 155-4 Hoggard offers one loose ball and is punished for four by Dravid. Whilst watching the cricket, and writing, I am also reading Viz. And no-one can stop me. 63rd over India 151-4 A maiden for Craig White (her name is Elspeth de Joogen and she lives in castle Montafiore, in case you're wondering). 62nd over India 151-4 Another tight over from Hoggard who, on today's evidence at least, is back to top form after a disappointing summer so far. 61st over India 150-4 A not so impressive effort from Simon Jones, who offers more than one short ball to Rahul Dravid, which the batsman snaffles. How hot does the world have to get before it all catches fire, or at least starts to sizzle? 60th over India 140-4 Matthew Hoggard claims his 50th Test wicket, and it just happens to be that of Sachin Tendulkar. Another full length ball running about 90mph encourages the little master into a shot he can't make. He plays, he misses, and his leg stump comes flying out. Oh, forget that, he's just claimed his 51st Test wicket, taking Sourav Ganguly lbw for a duck. The ball pitches outside leg stump and gives umpire Rudi Koertzen a dilemma but, after a short pause, his finger comes up. VVS Laxman survives the next ball, the last of the over, to deny Hoggy a hat-trick. I'm pooped, how are you?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
