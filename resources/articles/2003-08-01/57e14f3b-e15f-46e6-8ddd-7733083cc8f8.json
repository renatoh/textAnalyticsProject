Bowie, a regular on the US tour for three years but with a best finish of third - twice - had a six-under-par 66 yesterday to add to her first-round 70 and, at eight under, leads by two from the American's compatriot Wendy Ward and the Korean Se Ri Pak. There is a formidable group on five under: the champion Karrie Webb from Australia, Grace Park of Korea, Mexico's Lorena Ochoa, Akiko Fukushima of Japan and France's Patricia Meunier-Lebouc. When a gentle north-westerly blows at Lytham, the front nine becomes a teddy bear, leaving the back nine to protect the course's reputation by growling like a grizzly. Yesterday Park went to the turn in 29, six under par, with a run of five successive birdies from the 5th, but took 36 home; Ochoa went out in 31, and got back in 34, and the Spaniard Paula Marti had similar fortunes with 31-39. Florence Descampe, the former Solheim Cup player who prior to this season had not touched a club for seven years, took only 32 to go out. But the Belgian, who now has two children, took 36 to come home and after a first-round 85, she will be spending the weekend with her family. The 17 shots difference between Descampe's two rounds was, though, just beaten by the 19 managed by Diana Luna, a tall, slim, blonde Italian, who has done modelling work for her sponsors, the clothing company Conte of Florence. Luna recorded an eminently respectable 76 in the first round but 40 to the turn indicated that maybe all was not well yesterday. It wasn't. At the 14th she hit her second into a bunker and one of the four shots she took to get out hit her, adding two penalty strokes to her score. Out in eight, she chipped on and almost inevitably three-putted for her 12. Then, at the 18th, she drove into one of the bunkers on the left and, notwithstanding all her previous practice, managed to hit herself with the ball again. Out in five, she found yet another bunker, had to come out backwards, chipped on and two-putted for her 10. It meant 55 home, a total of 95 and the worst round, by three, in the history of this championship. The previous worst was Kristi Albers' 92. It also meant a surprising verdict from Luna herself. \"It's a beautiful course,\" she said. \"I reallyenjoyed it. And, you know, I'm normally very good out of bunkers, really good.\" Pak has a remarkable record in majors. She won the sixth and seventh in which she played and has since added two more, plus four top-10 finishes. She needed an interpreter for the first two but has since acquired a delightfully fractured form of English. She did not enjoy her first experience of Lytham in 1998, her second year as a professional, and came to England \"expecting lot of raining\". She was also expecting to be mis erable. \"Last time weather, food, everything makes me hard time,\" she explained. Since then she has had to adjust to American food and, once that is done, all things are possible. Good players are usually grouped together, for the benefit of television, but it is still unusual to see three golfers play 18 holes together and record only one bogey between them. Angela Stanford had none, Ochoa had none and Pak spoiled the perfect record when, rather than making a birdie on the long 11th like most of the field, she dropped a shot. Attempting to punch her third shot under the wind, she said: \"As soon hit it, winds get really calm.\" The ball sailed over the green and that was a six. Meunier-Lebouc, winner of the first major of the year, the Kraft Nabisco Championship, is five weeks pregnant and yet, as a current champion, is almost certain to get into the Solheim Cup team in September. By then she will be in her fourth month but, if she plays, will hope to follow the example of Carin Koch who played in the US two years ago while two months gone - and got 4 points out of five."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
