But by lunchtime Rojas was dead \u2013 shot in the head at close range by an unknown assassin whose attack pushed the number of homicides here to almost 1,800 so far this year, and nearly 26,000 nationwide. When first responders arrived they encountered a fearful scene: the victim slumped backwards in a black swivel chair, her arms flopping downwards towards a pool of blood as if she had been caught completely by surprise. \u201cShe was a decent girl, a good-looking girl \u2013 she was always smiling,\u201d said her longtime boyfriend\u2019s father as shellshocked relatives gathered outside and crime scene officers prepared to transport Rojas\u2019s body to the city\u2019s overburdened morgue. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating what is happening here,\u201d said the man, who asked not to be named. \u201cIt is out of control.\u201d Pacifying Mexico When Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador became Mexico\u2019s president last December he vowed to \u201cpacify\u201d one of Latin America\u2019s most violent nations by waging war on the social roots of crime. But nearly a year later there is scant sign of progress, as the country reels from a series of humiliating high-profile attacks and murder statistics surge to levels not seen even during the darkest days of Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s 2006-2012 \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. Last month Mexico\u2019s security chief, Alfonso Durazo, claimed the crisis was reaching \u201cinflection point\u201d \u2013 only for his upbeat message to be imploded by a week of mayhem which saw cartel gunmen slay 13 police officers and then paralyze a major city in order to free the son of Mexico\u2019s most famous drug lord, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. In the first nine months of this year, Mexico suffered an average of close to 100 murders a day. Tijuana has seen a methamphetamine-fuelled murder epidemic which produced a record 2,518 murders in 2018 and looks set to cause even more this year. \u201cThe state has lost control,\u201d said Victor Clark, a security expert and activist based in the city. \u2018Killings that matter to no one\u2019 To explore the violence blighting Latin America\u2019s number two economy the Guardian spent seven days reporting from Tijuana \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most deadly cities \u2013 between 4 and 11 October. The Guardian\u2019s week had an unusually peacefully start, with not a single murder recorded in the first 24 hours, according to the newly elected mayor, Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez Cruz. Gonz\u00e1lez, a L\u00f3pez Obrador ally, claimed that had not happened in several years and voiced frustration the media had ignored the achievement. But by day two the slaughter had resumed. At 6am a man\u2019s body was found dumped in the eastern neighbourhood of Emperadores. At 11.35am a decomposing pair of legs were spotted on wasteland in the city\u2019s south. And at 2.45pm an unidentified killer barged into a home on Calle Tamaulipas, pulled out a gun and brought an unidentified male\u2019s life to an end. \u201cMunicipal police officers mounted an operation to track down the person thought responsible for the attack,\u201d one local tabloid reported \u2013 though in a country where more than 90% of crimes go unpunished there was no indication they had succeeded. Outside Tijuana\u2019s general hospital a bullet-riddled people-carrier bore witness to the latest gunfight. What had happened? \u201cAn accident,\u201d a police investigator snapped, shooing reporters away as forensic science officers marked each of the entry holes with white cards marked A-K. The next evening 30-year-old Jes\u00fas Bernal staggered into an alley off Calle Belice, blood oozing from at least four separate gunshot wounds in his legs and wrists. As ambulance technicians strapped the blood-spattered man to a stretcher with silver duct tape, a police officer claimed he was a convicted burglar probably shot while trying to rob a local home. \u201cIt\u2019s a punishment \u2026 a message,\u201d speculated one of the first responders. But like so much of the bloodletting, the case would go unreported by newspapers, unnoticed by society and unsolved by the police. \u201cThese are killings that matter to no one,\u201d Clark said. \u2018An era of great psychological terror\u2019 It has been just over a decade since a savage turf war for control of drug smuggling routes into the United States made Tijuana one of the most ill-famed cities on Earth. There was an explosion of carnage in 2008 as El Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa cartel tried to muscle in on what had long been the domain of the locally based Tijuana mob. Corpses were hung from bridges and shootouts raged, even in the city\u2019s most glitzy corners. In one of the most disturbing episodes 12 corpses were abandoned with their tongues hacked out and placed nearby in a black plastic bag. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t go out because you were scared of what might happen,\u201d recalled Dora Elena Cort\u00e9s, a local journalist whose Agencia Fronteriza de Noticias chronicled the butchery. \u201cIt was an era of great psychological terror.\u201d Negative headlines sparked government action and by 2012 the number of annual murders had plunged. But Tijuana\u2019s murder rate is now soaring once again with the slaughter so routine that one local newspaper features a muert\u00f3metro (deathometer) to help readers keep track. Authorities and academics blame the new wave of violence on a largely hidden dispute for Tijuana\u2019s drug trade \u2013 particularly that of crystal meth \u2013 although Brianna Rojas\u2019s murder did not seem to fit that mould. \u201cThese deaths aren\u2019t about the fight for control of the routes into the US. They\u2019re fighting over the local market,\u201d said Clark. That appeared to be what was at stake on the night of 8 October when dozens of heavily armed police descended on a petrol station after a drive-by shooting left four men injured, one critically. Illuminated in the the red and blue lights of emergency vehicles, a half-naked man lay in a pool of blood, shot through the thigh and fighting for his life. After a 10-minute race to the hospital, he was carried in past police with white skulls stamped on to their black uniforms and rifles slung from their shoulders. Investigators barked questions at the man\u2019s three accomplices as they lay bleeding in the corridor. Mayor Gonz\u00e1lez admitted it was \u201cunreal\u201d to expect an immediate end to Tijuana\u2019s murder crisis but hoped the body count could be reduced and insisted the city\u2019s \u201ceconomic dynamism\u201d remained unaffected. During an interview at Tijuana\u2019s brutalist city hall he reiterated the president\u2019s doctrine that crime would only be stopped by rehabilitating Tijuana\u2019s \u201csocial fabric\u201d and eradicating corruption. \u201cCorruption is the mother of all evils, because it affects everything,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. Clark, the expert who has spent decades tracking Tijuana\u2019s security situation, was pessimistic such tactics alone would work. \u201cSo far nothing has changed \u2013 absolutely nothing,\u201d he said of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s first year in power. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt he has good intentions. But what they are doing isn\u2019t enough.\u201d For residents of Boulevard Fundadores, where Tijuana\u2019s public mortuary is located, change cannot come fast enough. On the afternoon of 9 October, as Brianna Rojas\u2019s mother came to recover her daughter\u2019s corpse, the cloying stench of decomposing bodies hung in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. Every single day we breathe death,\u201d fumed one local woman who has been campaigning to get the morgue moved. The woman reached for her smartphone to show a series of macabre images depicting conditions inside. One showed perhaps two dozen naked corpses sprawled on the floor, a putrid tangle of bloodied limbs. \u201cAt night it\u2019s like there are 60 dead dogs lying out here,\u201d the woman complained of the reek. \u201cWe can\u2019t open our windows.\u201d Forty-eight hours later \u2013 as the week reached a bloody peak - emergency workers from Mexico\u2019s Red Cross raced westwards to collect their latest cargo from a tumbledown community called Francisco Villa. A man was hauled semi-conscious from a hillside shooting gallery and hoisted into the ambulance, his arms bound with bandages to prevent him lashing out. \u201cHe got shot in the skull,\u201d one of the team said. Would he survive? \u201c50-50,\u201d they replied. Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
