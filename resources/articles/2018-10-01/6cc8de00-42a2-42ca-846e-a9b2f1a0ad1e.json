When South Africa scan their hosts\u2019 team-sheet on Thursday they will find no sign of the Vunipola brothers, Joe Launchbury, Chris Robshaw, Nathan Hughes, Dan Cole, Joe Marler, Sam Simmonds nor, potentially, Courtney Lawes. In the back row, in particular, there is scaffolding up everywhere. One name, however, will leap out at the Springbok forwards. Not so long ago, before his move to Saracens in 2015, Michael Rhodes was their provincial teammate, plying his trade for the Stormers in Cape Town without ever tempting the South African selectors. Three years later he is eligible for England on residency grounds and is on the brink of colliding with the land of his birth this Saturday. The permutations remain many and various at No 6 \u2013 Maro Itoje, Brad Shields and Mark Wilson are also candidates for Robshaw\u2019s vacant jersey \u2013 but Eddie Jones is clearly a fan of Rhodes\u2019s no-nonsense physicality. \u201cWhen he hits he hurts,\u201d the head coach said last week. England have little option but to fire some shots up front if their powerful Bok visitors are to be subdued. In the meantime Rhodes is still getting his head around the idea of lining up in a white jersey at Twickenham. He came to the UK with no thought of representing England and freely admits that this weekend will feel a touch surreal. \u201cThree years ago I\u2019d have never believed you if you\u2019d said: \u2018You\u2019ll be in the England camp leading into a possible game against South Africa.\u2019 It is strange how things work out but I\u2019m very happy how it is.\u201d Even his father, who runs a fruit farm on the edge of Kruger National Park, has not yet told him which team he will be cheering. \u201cI think my old man\u2019s been getting more flak than me from his mates about who he\u2019ll be supporting.\u201d At Saracens his fellow England squad member George Kruis has been joking that Rhodes\u2019s version of the national anthem \u2013 \u201cGod save our lekker Queen, long live our lekker Queen!\u201d \u2013 will be somewhat different to everyone else\u2019s. Long gone are the days, though, when international rugby players had to be entirely locally grown. Rhodes is among the last players to qualify under the old three-year residency rule \u2013 it is now five \u2013 but believes any doubters should judge him on his commitment to the England cause. \u201cTo those people I would say that my goal is to win rugby games with England,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are supporting the team, then the winning is what they should be concerned about. \u201cI am going to play as hard as possible \u2026 when it comes down to it there should be no doubt where my commitment lies. One or two other guys have done it. I am quite comfortable, it is not something that bothers me.\u201d Plenty have indeed trodden a similar path, with the Kiwi-reared Shields and former Scotland age\u2011group cap Zach Mercer vying for places alongside Rhodes this weekend. With his 31st birthday looming in December, the latter can hardly be accused of premeditated opportunism. \u201cI left my international aspirations in South Africa when I left there. I didn\u2019t even know there was a three\u2011year qualification period. It wasn\u2019t a case of thinking \u2018I want to play for England\u2019; that was never on the table when I first moved here.\u201d Rhodes, who grew up idolising Natal\u2019s Gary Teichmann and the spiky former Bok winger James Small, has certainly made the most of his fresh start, having already tasted domestic and European glory with Saracens. His time in England has been marred only by injury, which required him to undergo no fewer than six operations last season to repair shoulder, collarbone and hamstring problems. It has not diminished his appetite for the game\u2019s physical aspects: \u201cI do enjoy the defence and the confrontational side of things. Being able to stop the momentum of the other side is huge in the modern game. It\u2019s something I take pride in.\u201d It could be that England also turn to Ben Morgan for extra physical support, and not just because the Gloucester No 8 has started a family scaffolding business. Whether Rhodes starts or is picked on the bench, however, a fascinating weekend looms. As an Afrikaans speaker he is already braced for the odd barbed comment from his old mates. \u201cThey might try to niggle and get under my skin but I think I can just ignore that and get on with the game. Hopefully we\u2019ll play hard and then catch up afterwards.\u201d And the anthems? \u201cWe\u2019ll wait to see if I make the side and then I\u2019ll start thinking about things like that. I haven\u2019t really thought about what it would be like to be stood there. I don\u2019t want to jinx myself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
