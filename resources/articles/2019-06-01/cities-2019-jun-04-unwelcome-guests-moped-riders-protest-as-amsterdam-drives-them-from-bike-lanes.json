This isn\u2019t some strange Dutch festival, though. These were protests from some of the thousands of furious moped riders ahead of a new city regulation which came into force this week to force them out of bike lanes, on to main roads and into helmets. The cycling city of Amsterdam is stepping up a gear \u2013 with plans to ban petrol and diesel vehicles from the centre by 2030, the removal of 10,000 car-parking spaces, a hike in parking charges and a wide range of measures to take from the car and give to pedestrians, cyclists, green space and children. Even in a city where 35% of journeys are by bike, not everyone is happy. Almost 50,000 people have signed a petition protesting about potential accidents for mopeds in much faster-moving traffic, and 4,000 commented on the policy when it was at a consultation level \u2013 an unheard-of response. Motoring organisations such as RAI Vereniging are furious about the threat to diesel and petrol vehicles from the Clean Air Action plan, and one Amsterdam resident, Frank Bakker, even tried to take the city mayor to court last year to enforce traffic regulations and stop bikes running red lights. Mopeds have been blatantly flouting the new law by riding in the bike lanes and without helmets, risking a \u20ac95 fine. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been properly thought through,\u201d said one woman defiantly riding a moped on the bike lane, who asked not to be named. \u201cIt\u2019s very unclear when we are allowed on the bike lane and where we aren\u2019t, and there are certain junctions where there\u2019s just not enough space on the road. I find it absolutely terrifying.\u201d Paul de Waal, a spokesman for the BOVAG transport retailers\u2019 union, goes further and calls putting mopeds on the road a \u201cdangerous, life-threatening experiment\u201d. \u201cIt effectively blames one group of riders for all of the problems,\u201d he says, \u201cand you haven\u2019t solved the bike lane overload. We think it would be far better to widen the infrastructure for two-wheeled vehicles \u2013 at the expense of space for cars. The car isn\u2019t holy, but nor are the cyclist or the pedestrian: you need to look at it all together.\u201d None of this is stopping the green-left city government, though, which points out that nine streets already break EU air pollution limits and that the city is predicted to steadily get larger and busier. \u201cI think that the car is a symbol of freedom,\u201d acknowledges the municipal head of transport, Sharon Dijksma. \u201cMany people are attached to the symbol even if they in their daily life don\u2019t use it a lot. I\u2019m not fighting cars but what I do fight for is more space for pedestrians, children to play on our streets, for cyclists, public transport and trees. \u201cWe really want to make a change and people need to see the change on the street: a fundamental improvement of public space. Public space is probably the most scarce item we have \u2013 like a jewel \u2013 and we need to take care of it. That\u2019s not so easy sometimes as there are a lot of interests.\u201d The protests are a good sign, according to some academics. \u201cThe fact that there is resistance is a perfect sign that people are [implicitly] aware that there is much more at stake than just a technical engineering question of optimising the traffic system,\u201d says Marco te Brommelstroet, associate professor in urban planning at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cIt is about lifestyles, and about what cities and society should be.\u201d Some residents believe the city is not going far enough, and needs to send an even clearer sign that cars should play \u201csecond fiddle\u201d to active mobility. \u201cThe challenge is that the current infrastructure isn\u2019t just good enough \u2013 it might have met the needs of 20 years ago, but cycling has grown enormously,\u201d says Martijn van Es, a spokesman for the Fietsersbond Dutch cyclists\u2019 union. \u201cThere are a lot more types of bicycle like cargo and e-bikes, which go a lot faster, and Amsterdam\u2019s narrow bike lanes aren\u2019t built for them.\u201d Katelijne Boerma, the bicycle mayor of Amsterdam, says the 100,000 people on bikes every weekday between 8am and 9am clearly do not have enough space. \u201cIf there\u2019s a lack of space \u2013 which is the case for cyclists \u2013 then people start behaving badly and the bike lanes and a lot of pavements in the centre for pedestrians have a kind of \u2018surviving the jungle\u2019 attitude. We all need to work on our fietsfatsoen, which is an old-fashioned word for courtesy. The taxi driver blames the cyclist, the tram driver blames the car driver \u2026 but at the end of the day traffic is all of us.\u201d Te Brommelstroet points out that there has always been resistance to transport innovations in Amsterdam, and that the city\u2019s residents actually voted in favour of a car-free inner city in a referendum in 1992. \u201cNow the time is ripe for a more radical next step, taking back the street as a \u2018sticky\u2019 place where society flourishes and motor vehicles are a guest,\u201d he says. \u201cAn unwelcome guest.\u201d And while car-heavy areas such as the Zuidas business district have been weighing up how they could get people into shared, possibly self-driving electric transport in the future, some Amsterdammers are convinced they have the future of transport right in front of them in the form of the bicycle. \u201cEvery time they talk about autonomous cars, we say we already have such a great invention,\u201d says Boerma. \u201cThe best mobility solution is already sitting in your shed.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
