But in just a few minutes the sun had risen behind a dark, blue-grey band of dense cloud that was to herald a gloomy day with bone-chilling temperatures. My friend Stephen Sampson recalled that 67 years ago tomorrow (the notorious December 12 1940 in these parts) he and his wife had driven down the dale from the farm to visit his father, a pioneer Sheffield veterinary surgeon, at the edge of the city. Stephen and his wife had planned to visit the cinema that night, but fortune smiled on them as things turned out. First Stephen's sister was delegated to take her father's car down the road to park it at the surgery. While she was away the air raid siren sounded and, when she didn't return on foot, Stephen set off in the \"black-out\". By chance he found her wandering, quite lost in the dark streets, just as the first bombs dropped on the city centre. Back at his father's house he decided a cinema visit was not a wise excursion on that particular night, so moved his own car down the road and remembered to drain the radiator as a hard frost set in. The family retreated to the father's wine cellar for a disturbed and chilly night, as bombs rained down on the city, which was not very far away. The car was covered in ice next morning, but eventually Stephen and his wife were able to set off up the dale towards home. The live-in cowman, showing great relief, met them in the yard because he had spent an anxious night when his boss didn't return from the planned cinema trip. The cowman's anxiety had been compounded by the distant cacophony of Sheffield's worst night blitz of the war."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
