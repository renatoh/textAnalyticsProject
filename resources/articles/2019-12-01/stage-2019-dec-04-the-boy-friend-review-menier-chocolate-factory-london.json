Although set in the 1920s, it seems to exist, like the work of PG Wodehouse, in its own exquisitely fabricated world where wealth proves no obstacle to true love and where the sun always shines. It also gets a pitch-perfect revival from Matthew White in which light irony never descends into camp knowingness. The Riviera-based story, involving the romantic entanglement of a millionaire\u2019s daughter and an aristocrat\u2019s son, is simply a teasing trifle. What really counts are Wilson\u2019s melodic gift and verbal dexterity. His delicious score, embracing tap, tango and a two-step, is a positive invitation to dance that Bill Deamer\u2019s choreography eagerly accepts: Won\u2019t You Charleston With Me? is the showstopper with Gabrielle Lewis-Dodson, as one of the young ladies at a French finishing school, doing some of the highest kicks you could wish to see. The one potential pitfall is a comedy number in which Adrian Edmondson as an ageing aristocrat hymns the virtues of mature passion assuring us that \u201ca fiddle that\u2019s old is more in tune\u201d. The difficulties of the sentiments are awkwardly circumvented, but that\u2019s the only blot on a richly pleasurable evening. As the young lovers, Amara Okereke and Dylan Mason, dwelling on the imagined delights of A Room in Bloomsbury, have the right air of rhapsodic innocence. Janie Dee, sporting a bandanna and sunglasses, invests the school\u2019s French owner with a charm that never galls and sings her big number, Poor Little Pierrette, with memorable plaintiveness. Robert Portal, as her long-lost beau, delivers the line: \u201cI was a fool to pretend the old Percy was dead\u201d with an admirably straight face and Tiffany Graves, as an all-purpose maid, puts across It\u2019s Nicer in Nice with great zest while reminding us that Wilson cleverly deployed the Cole Porter technique of creating lyrics out of a long list. A special mention should go to Paul Farnsworth\u2019s costumes that with their ostrich-plumed headdresses and organdie frocks ideally match Wilson\u2019s exuberant period pastiche. \u2022At Menier Chocolate Factory, London, until 7 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
