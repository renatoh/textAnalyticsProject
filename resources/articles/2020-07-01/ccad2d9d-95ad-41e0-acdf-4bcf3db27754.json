Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial took their combined tally for the season to 44 goals as they scored either side of half-time at Selhurst Park to ensure United remain behind fourth-placed Leicester on goal difference with two games to play following the earlier victory for Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side against Sheffield United. United face Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday at Wembley before rounding off their Premier League campaign at home to West Ham in midweek and travelling to the King Power Stadium on the final day. But having now gone 19 games unbeaten in all competitions to surge into contention for the top four \u2013 a run that stretches back until January \u2013 Solskj\u00e6r admitted their destiny is now in his players\u2019 hands. \u201cWe need to smile and go into this, we have earned this right,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one thought in January that we would be in with a shout for top four. We have done fantastic since the restart. These are the games that matter. That is the thing at Manchester United, you have to step up and show your personality.\u201d The Palace chairman, Steve Parish, questioned the decision not to award Wilfried Zaha a penalty after he appeared to be fouled by Victor Lindel\u00f6f just before Rashford opened the scoring, but Solskj\u00e6r insisted the referee, Graham Scott, had made the correct call and praised his side\u2019s resilience. \u201cToday was about getting three points again,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re at that stage of the season where you don\u2019t get extra points for how it looks.\u201d Writing on Twitter, Parish compared the decision not to award Palace a penalty to a disallowed goal from Mamadou Sakho in last week\u2019s loss to Aston Villa: \u201cIs the VAR broken? Serious question. How can they look at Sakho \u2018handball\u2019 for minutes to make their \u2018mind up\u2019 and not even give that a glance! It\u2019s a stonewall nailed on penalty even the most one eyed Man U fan knows it.\u201d Jordan Ayew also had a goal disallowed for a marginal offside when United led 1-0 and Roy Hodgson admitted he is no fan of technology after Palace\u2019s sixth straight defeat. \u201cI\u2019m still finding it hard to come to terms with it all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not helping my feelings during the game or after the game having to stand here and talk about these type of things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
