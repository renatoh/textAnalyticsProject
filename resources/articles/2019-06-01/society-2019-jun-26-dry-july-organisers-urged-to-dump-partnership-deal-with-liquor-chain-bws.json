BWS announced its support for the charity last week saying it will help promote no-alcohol beers, ciders and spirits and sales staff will participate in the annual fundraiser. Its press statement announcement was headlined: \u201cBWS becomes \u2018Because We\u2019re Sober for Dry July\u2019.\u201d The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education chief executive, Michael Thorn, described the arrangement as \u201cill-conceived\u201d and said it should be dumped immediately. Thorn said it was akin to big tobacco companies supporting a lung cancer charity or arms dealers sponsoring the Australian War Memorial. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cUnless every BWS outlet shuts up shop for the month, this stunt will do nothing to reduce alcohol harm,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cThis is a cynical marketing exercise by BWS designed to push the Woolworths\u2019 alcohol brand and normalise alcohol.\u201d Alcohol is responsible for one in 20 deaths globally, according to the World Health Organisation. Dry July asks people to give up alcohol for a month and get sponsorship from family and friends with funds raised going towards improving the comfort and wellbeing of cancer sufferers. In 2019, 24,222 Australians have signed up and $1.7m has been raised so far. BWS operates more than 1,340 stores around Australia and says it is encouraging its sales staff to join the fundraiser and is hoping to field the largest corporate fundraising team to date. So far BWS staff have raised $3,418.22 and are ranked 13th on the team fundraising ladder. Since 2008, 160,000 Australians have gone sober in July raising $37m which has funded projects at 75 cancer organisations across the country. The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education has written to organisations that benefit from Dry July fundraising, including the Cancer Council of Australia, about their concerns. The Dry July Foundation chief executive, Brett MacDonald, defended the partnership with BWS, saying the charity was selective about teaming up with organisations. \u201cWe have partnered with BWS as they recognise the shift in attitudes and behaviours to alcohol consumption in Australia, and stock many non-alcoholic options in their stores for our participants,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cPrior to the partnership being confirmed, we consulted with our major cancer charity beneficiaries and informed them of the partnership with BWS.\u201d MacDonald declined to comment on the monetary value of the partnership arrangement. The BWS chief executive, Guy Brent, reiterated the alcohol chain was proud to be on board. \u201cUnfortunately many of our team members have been affected by cancer and the partnership with Dry July Foundation gives them an opportunity to raise funds for a cause close to their heart,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBWS believes in giving consumers choice, which is why in recent years it has increased its range of low and no alcohol drinks for those reducing their alcohol intake, taking part in Dry July, or choosing to abstain entirely.\u201d Comment has been sought from fundraiser beneficiaries the Cancer Council of Australia, the Leukaemia Foundation, the McGrath Foundation, Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, Look Good Feel Better and Redkite. The Cancer Council WA CEO, Ashley Reid, said: \u201cCancer Council is a third-party beneficiary of the Dry July campaign, owned and operated by the Dry July Foundation. BWS have partnered with the Dry July Foundation, not Cancer Council. We are not linked to the partnership or any associated promotion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
