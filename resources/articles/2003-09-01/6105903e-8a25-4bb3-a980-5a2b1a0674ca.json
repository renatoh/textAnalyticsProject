It's the same age as its owner and is about the oldest thing he possesses. His flat was built in 1979, within a small, low-rise development, in what my taxi driver tells me is a very nice part of town. Certainly, once inside the spacious apartment, looking out through the wall of glass in the living room, it feels more chic Palm Springs than grimy Steel City. Mellor comes from one of Sheffield's more prestigious families. His surname is stamped into cutlery made from local steel, and used in households and restaurants up and down the country. His father, David, is one of Britain's most prolific and consistent designers - the king of cutlery, no less. The David Mellor shop on London's Sloane Square, is to knives and forks what Manolo Blahnik down the road is to shoes. Father and son now work side by side, overseeing a surprisingly small production line of just 10 skilled workers at the Round House, the ingenious circular building constructed out of local stone by architect and family friend Sir Michael Hopkins. Corin has a short drive to work over the heathery Peak District, while David literally lives next door. He's always lived on-site. Before the Round House, the business was run from the family home, Broom Hall, an old mansion house that Mellor senior rescued and converted into a factory in the early 70s. 'I remember being tiny and playing about on a lathe,' says Corin. Design runs through the Mellor family's blood. 'I've always been in a design environment,' says Corin. His mother is the design writer Fiona MacCarthy, while his sister, Clare, runs her own graphic design company. It seemed almost inevitable that Corin should follow in his father's footsteps, and become a designer. He studied furniture and product design at Kingston Polytechnic and has been part of the family business for the past 15 years, doing everything from designing kitchen knives to overseeing the new website, avidmellordesign.co.uk. So you can imagine that when Corin Mellor does a bit of DIY, it is done to absolute perfection. The word 'bodge' is not part of his vocabulary. As well as pouring his own resin floor in the living room and kitchen, he made a lot of his own furniture including the dining table. The Arne Jacobsen chairs around it are part of his collection, most of which is in storage at his parents' warehouse. Then there is the futuristic looking glass-and-steel coffee table in the living room. It was inspired by the marble one that takes centre stage, which was designed by an Italian whose name he says he can't remember. He bought it at Bonhams for \u00a390. In true Mellor fashion, his own version uses local steel and local expertise. 'The cast iron base weighs about 30 kilos,' he says. It is one of the designs he would like to show as part of the 100 % Design show which opened yesterday, but he's not quite sure how to get it there because it is so heavy. He would also like to show the series of benches he has designed for the Lowry Centre in Manchester, and Sheffield's Millennium Gallery and Winter Gardens. One of them now resides outside the living room on his balcony. Alongside the heavy goods, there will be the more domestic items that David Mellor is well-known for. There's a new circular tray made by 'a little company in Sheffield that used to be a chopping-board manufacturer'. They still make boards for Mellor, as beautifully crafted as a chopping board can be. 'There are still places left in Sheffield that will make you things,' says Corin. And he has a bit of a passion for having things resprayed. There's the old cutlery cabinet in the living room, for instance, which came from the Manchester shop and has gone through a few colour changes, but is now powdery lilac. The shelves in the study, which he made out of RSJs, have been powder coated. And there are the jungle-green panels on the bathroom ceiling. Corin shares the home with his wife, Helen, a graphic designer and photographer, but there is little of their clutter on show. The kitchen is all state-of-the-art David Mellor perfection, from the kettle to the shiny 'minimal' cutlery in the drawer. When they bought the place, it was far from the ideal home it is today. There were olde worlde kitchen units, lots of luxurious carpet, doors everywhere, and flock wallpaper on some of the walls, which no amount of tongue-in-cheek designer irony would persuade Corin to keep. Instead everything is now cool, sleek and comfortably modern. And for a Mellor, that's just as it should be. \u00b7 The David Mellor stand is at 100 % Design, Earl's Court 2, London; public day is 28 September, 10-6.
