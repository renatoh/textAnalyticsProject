Wales, the defending champions who had lost their opening match against Ireland in Cardiff, have away matches against Italy and Scotland before ending the campaign against England in Cardiff. North, who sealed the match in the 73rd-minute, said Wales were not conceding their title. \"The media gave us a lot of flak after Ireland, but we stuck together and will move forward together,\" the wing said. \"The title race is not over. There is a lot for us to play for and achieve. We always felt that our fitness would tell against France and it was an important try. It was a great chip by Dan Biggar and I think we both saw what was on at the same time, shouting at each other to go for it.\" The victory lifted some of the pressure on Wales's interim head coach, Robert Howley, who since taking over from Warren Gatland last summer had tasted success only against the Barbarians. \"We knew we had not become a bad team less than a year after winning the grand slam,\" Howley said. \"We defended well tonight and put a lot of pressure on France when they had the ball. This will give us belief and we can go into our next match with Italy with confidence.\" Ryan Jones, leading Wales for a record 30th time in the absence of the injured Sam Warburton, was one of only three players in the starting lineup who had tasted success in Paris. \"It is one of the most difficult places in rugby to come and win,\" he said. \"We talked beforehand about the battle we faced and while it was by no means a flawless display, we worked incredibly hard and fronted up. We were braced and tackled them head-on.\" The defeat leaves France with thinking to do ahead of their next game against England at Twickenham. They have lost their past four matches in the Six Nations, their worst run in the tournament, and were booed off the pitch by those fans who had stayed until the end. \"It is a difficult time for us,\" said the France coach, Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9. \"We know we cannot win the Six Nations now and it is very frustrating. We had chances to score but did not take them whereas Wales had one opportunity and took it. We are bottom of the table but we will not give up and we will not be scared of England. We will fight and show desire.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
