Woods was in clear discomfort throughout his time on the course, the 39-year-old routinely holding his back after shots and limping. Even his playing partner, Billy Horschel, took to lifting Woods\u2019s tee peg from the ground and picking his ball from the hole on occasion. Remarkably, Woods played his first 10 holes in level par but he slipped to a double-bogey six on his 11th. This was painful viewing. By the 3rd green, Woods\u2019s 12th, he decided enough was enough. This marks Woods\u2019s third mid-tournament withdrawal in eight starts and the fifth time since 2011 he has been forced into such a move. Woods drove straight from the California venue, rather than heading for on-site physiotherapy treatment. The timing could barely be worse, with the first major of the season, the Masters, nine weeks away. Woods missed the cut in his first event of the year, the Waste Management Phoenix Open, last weekend having shot a second round of 82 \u2013 his worst as a professional \u2013 but insisted his health was fine. Back surgery caused him to miss a chunk of last year, including the Masters, so there will be obvious and deep-rooted concern regarding his latest setback. Speaking from the car park at Torrey Pines, Woods insisted that a delay of two and a half hours for fog had played a part in his problem. Onlookers described him as looking uncomfortable during his warm-up. \u201cIt\u2019s just my glutes are shutting off,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t activate, hence it goes into my lower back. It is frustrating that I just can\u2019t stay activated. It just got progressively tighter.\u201d The former world No1 had started this week as 56th in the PGA Tour rankings. His position will now drop further, decreasing his chances of featuring in the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Doral at the start of March. Not for the first time, however, Woods has bigger issues with which to concern himself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
