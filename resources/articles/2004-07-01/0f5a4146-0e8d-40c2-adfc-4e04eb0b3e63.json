The 10% funding gap publicly quoted by ministers and officials fails to take into account the much severer financial penalties colleges suffer when students drop out or reduce the number of courses they pursue, according to Nigel Robbins, principal of Cirencester College. He says he has made a detailed analysis showing he gets 37% less in funding than a local school sixth form running similar programmes. Having alerted Ivan Lewis, the adult skills minister, to his calculations at a recent conference, Robbins is calling on the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) urgently to set up a working group to address the discrepancy. A spokeswoman said the DfES is \"willing\" to investigate the funding issues. Colleges' grievances about being less generously funded than school sixth forms have been exacerbated by the end-of-year shambles over their cash allocations for 2004-05. Local learning and skills councils not only failed to tell colleges their allocations by the end of May, but at least one college had not received official notification by June 30, the deadline set by the further education minister, Alan Johnson. Colleges have now had a letter from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) warning them that, despite halving the time they have for getting their budgets approved by the governing bodies and submitting them to their local LSC, it is not going to extend the July 31 deadline. Many colleges will now have to haul in governors - all volunteers - in a month's time, when many will have booked holidays, to hold extraordinary budget meetings. \"We understand the reasons for the delay in getting allocations out to colleges but . . . yet again, colleges are being forced to set their budgets at short notice,\" says Julian Gravatt, director of funding and development at the Association of Colleges. \"Governing bodies cannot do their jobs effectively if the government takes them for granted.\" According to Robbins, comparisons that have been made between school and college funding have gone little further than the different \"tariffs\" each gets for teaching the same qualification. For instance, the junior education minister Stephen Twigg recently said the funding rate for an A-level in a school (\u00a3734) was about 10% higher than in a further education college (\u00a3663) in 2002-03. \"Nobody has scratched under the surface to see how the tariff is applied,\" says Robbins. \"There are different rules. When a student leaves in our sector, we lose funding almost immediately.\" After a student has been absent for four consecutive weeks he or she is deemed to have left and the college loses the funding for that student for the rest of the year. Drop-outs and course reductions typically cost Cirencester College \u00a3500,000 a year. Schools do lose money, Robbins adds, but at a lesser rate. This happens if they lose 10% or more of their sixth-formers by Christmas, and if student achievement is particularly poor at the end of the school year. Schools submit their students' figures in September and that is the basis for their funding in the academic year beginning the following autumn, he says. \"This is when student numbers are highest and programmes are at their fullest. \"Heads have told me that the game they play is to maximise their student numbers in September and get them to take as many programmes as possible.\" Robbins accepts there is a logic in the funding approach to colleges and says he is not advocating either methodology. But it is unfair, he says, that colleges are funded strictly on the students they have and what they actually do, while schools are funded for the maximum potential work their students might achieve. The result is that schools can afford to pay their staff better and colleges continue to lose staff to them, says Robbins. \"There should be a level playing field.\" A DfES spokeswoman said: \"Wider reviews of the differences in funding between schools and FE have been undertaken in the past and the department is of course willing to work with the LSC and partners in the sector to take a wider look at the issues.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
