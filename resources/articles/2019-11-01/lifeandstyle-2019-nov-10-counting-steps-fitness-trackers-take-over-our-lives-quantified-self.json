How fitness trackers can take over our lives", "bodyText": "Martin Lewis owns his obsessiveness about counting steps with something approaching pride. \u201cI\u2019ve never done less than 10,000 steps in any day for the last three years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut to be honest, if I do just 10,000 steps, I\u2019m never happy. My average is nearer 25,000. It\u2019s an obsession.\u201d It\u2019s not as though the founder of Moneysavingexpert.com has nothing else to do. Lewis is seldom off-air, and returns to present another series of The Martin Lewis Money Show on ITV later this month. He tracks his steps, has a graph of his weightlifting routine, and even keeps track of the Scrabble games he plays with his wife, the TV presenter Lara Lewington. He credits his step obsession \u2013 which includes running 25 miles a week \u2013 with losing weight and helping him reduce symptoms of repetitive strain injury. \u201cIt\u2019s not coincidental that I\u2019m the guy who knows credit rates off the top of his head,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is how my brain works.\u201d Lewis is one of a substantial number of people who has embraced the idea of a \u201cquantified self\u201d (QS), a term invented by former tech journalist Gary Wolf to describe people who measure themselves \u2013 their bodies, their behaviour \u2013 in pursuit of things like weight loss, better sleep, great fitness: \u201cself-knowledge through self-tracking\u201d. The movement was prompted by the emergence first of smartphones and then wearable tech \u2013 fitness trackers such as Fitbit, the Apple Watch, heart rate monitors and cycling computers. When Apple launched its watch in 2014, it seemed as though the quantified self could be the route to solving problems such as obesity. It hasn\u2019t quite worked out that way. Breathless investor reports about wearables focus mostly on the popularity of headphones and earbuds. The number of smart watches sold worldwide in 2018 was 45 million, a tiny number compared with the 1.43 billion smartphones sold in the same year. As for the wearables manufacturers, Fitbit, which had been plateauing, was bought by Google last week. Jawbone went out of business two years ago. Withings was bought by Nokia in 2016: two years later they sold it back to its founder. But QS isn\u2019t dead \u2013 about a third of smartphone users track their health using technology, and there is some evidence that it can work. Vitality, the life insurer, provides discounted Apple watches to members and rewards them if they stay active. A study last year found people on the scheme increased their activity by about 34%. \u201cIt can have benefits. It can help people be more mindful of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d says Dr Josie Perry, a sports psychologist. Some wearable devices include a social element, such as Nike+, where users can track their performance against friends, she says. \u201cIt seems that the sticky element is the community element, rather than the data element.\u201d She could be talking about Lewis. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly competitive,\u201d he says. \u201cThe poor people who are friends with me ignore me these days. One of my sister\u2019s best friends, Meital, is generally number two, and she\u2019s very happy when she beats me. I remember once I called my sister on a Sunday night when I was walking round the sofa getting steps. She said, \u2018you know Meital is walking round the sofa to beat you this week\u2019? But I was ahead.\u201d Lewis admits he scaled things back two years ago, when he was doing well over 25,000 steps a day. \u201cIt was controlling my life too much. I would say, \u2018well, we can\u2019t go out there because I won\u2019t get my steps in\u2019. I genuinely found it dictating where I was going.\u201d Not everyone has the same motivation as Lewis, though, and some QS acolytes have given up, saying they have learned nothing. The problem is that people using tech often measure the wrong thing, says Jakob Eg Larsen, an associate professor in cognitive systems at the Technical University of Denmark who has been following the QS movement since it was founded. \u201cYou only need a pen and paper, writing things down in a notebook, putting numbers on a spreadsheet,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the reasons why people eventually give up on their fitness trackers is because they might have a question, but they don\u2019t necessarily get an answer if it\u2019s not baked into the technology from a commercial vendor.\u201d People who report good outcomes tend to have a more scientific approach, Larsen says: asking a question, forming a hypothesis, gathering data, then analysing it. He mentions a case of a man with severe allergies who tracked every meal on a spreadsheet to see what coincided with episodes of allergic reaction. After isolating different types of food and changing his diet, he no longer needed to take medication, Larsen says. Another QS practitioner discovered that her tinnitus seemed less pronounced the more she monitored it. And the hope is that these individual anecdotes might inform medical research. \u201cThere are lots of cases which could be inspiration for academic researchers,\u201d Larsen says. But people should be cautious about the outcomes of experimenting on themselves, according to Dr Tom Calvard, a senior lecturer in human resource management at the University of Edinburgh Business School. \u201cWe\u2019re all becoming lay psychologists, folk psychologists, and that\u2019s troubling because we\u2019re not statisticians, and we\u2019re not expert in interpreting our own data,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we can jump to the wrong conclusions.\u201d There are other ethical issues, such as raised by the technology writer Evgeny Morozov. By measuring ourselves, and taking responsibility for our own health, does this give licence to the authorities to sideline more vulnerable people? For Calvard, the experience of elderly people given a panic button is evidence that this is already happening \u2013 it allows the state to narrow its responsibilities to a specific, measurable response rather than a more holistic approach that can\u2019t be proved with data. When wearable tech is deployed by companies to monitor their own staff, things can become more sinister. Many companies routinely monitor the location of their drivers, which has the twin effect of establishing their safety but also reducing their control. \u201cSurveillance capitalism\u201d, as described by Shoshana Zuboff, leads to Amazon warehouse employees being tracked with wristbands and warned if they are not meeting productivity expectations. The experience of James Bloodworth, who went undercover as an Amazon picker for six months, was that some employees had no time for toilet breaks so used bottles instead. Last year, a US vending machine company even asked its employees to be implanted with microchips. But is this data worth anything? Does it help a company to know how long it takes an employee to get round a warehouse if it doesn\u2019t also know about the bottles of urine, or how many customers cancel their Amazon accounts when they read about them, or how many politicians decide to attack the company\u2019s tax arrangements as a result? Even people tracking themselves can discover negative effects from the monitoring alone. \u201cI did a study last year and one of the athletes I spoke to had been injured,\u201d Perry says. \u201cShe went for her first run back and it was a beautiful morning, running by the river, and she loved every second. She got back, uploaded her time to [fitness network] Strava, and she could see that her brother had run a bit further, and a friend had run a bit faster. And she said she felt like a failure, all that joy wiped out.\u201d Lewis insists he could give up. \u201cI\u2019m aware it\u2019s an obsession but it\u2019s not an addiction. I\u2019m deliberately making a choice not to break the obsession because I think it\u2019s a healthy obsession.\u201d But it has had one unexpected effect. Lewis has rearranged his schedule so that he walks to and from work most days \u2013 about two hours of steps. He fills the time with phone calls and was embarrassed during one conversation with a cabinet minister that couldn\u2019t be heard above the traffic. \u201cI bought an expensive set of noise-cancelling headphones,\u201d he says. \u201cSo my fitness tracker has actually made me break my own money-saving rule.\u201d Analyse this L\u2019Or\u00e9al My Skin Track UV A pendant that claims to measure things that harm your skin, such as UV, pollution, pollen and humidity.
