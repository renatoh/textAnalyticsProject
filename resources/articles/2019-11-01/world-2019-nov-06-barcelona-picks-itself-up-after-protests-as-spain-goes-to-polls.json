Three weeks after violent unrest greeted the Spanish supreme court\u2019s decision to jail nine Catalan separatist leaders for sedition over their roles in the failed push for regional independence two years ago, the city is slowly returning to something resembling normality. While sporadic roadblocks set up by protesters have become just another irritation of urban life and rubbish piles up on the streets after most of the bins in central Barcelona were burned on the barricades, the true impact may be more accurately measured on Sunday when Spain holds its fourth general election in as many years. The Catalan question is once again dominating the political debate and could help the far-right Vox party surge into third place, its best-ever result. The socialist government of the caretaker prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has sought to cool tensions while also criticising the pro-independence Catalan regional government for taking too long to condemn the violence and for continuing to peddle what it terms secessionist fantasies. But its stance has angered rightwing Spanish parties, who have demanded a much tougher approach and attacked S\u00e1nchez for being too soft in the face of the enduring threat to Spain\u2019s national unity. Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), said in a debate on Monday night that S\u00e1nchez did not believe \u201cin the Spanish nation\u201d, while Santiago Abascal, the Vox leader, referred to events in Catalonia as \u201ca permanent coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d. S\u00e1nchez retaliated by laying into Casado and Albert Rivera, the leader of the centre-right Citizens party, reminding them they had both enlisted the support of Vox \u2013 the first avowedly far-right grouping to win more than a single seat in the national parliament since Spain returned to democracy after the death of Gen Francisco Franco in 1975 \u2013 to take power in regional governments, including in Andaluc\u00eda and Madrid. \u201cYou two represent the cowardly right in the face of an aggressive far right,\u201d he said. Polls suggest S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialists will win the most votes on Sunday but again fall short of a majority, as it did in April\u2019s election. The PP appears to be bouncing back from its disastrous showing last time when it lost more than half its seats, but things look bleak for Citizens, which has lurched further to the right and which refused to help S\u00e1nchez form a government. Its loss seems to be Vox\u2019s gain: with support for Citizens plummeting, the far-right grouping could move past it and the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos to become the third biggest force in Spanish politics. Three years after Podemos was widely \u2013 but incorrectly \u2013 predicted to leapfrog the Socialists to become Spain\u2019s leading leftwing party, the talk is once again of a sorpasso (overtaking). \u201cIt\u2019s clear that everything that\u2019s happened in Catalonia in reaction to the sentence has completely captured the public agenda,\u201d said Guillem Vidal, a postdoctoral researcher at the Berlin Social Science Centre. \u201cWhat it\u2019s done, deep down, is polarise the whole national political agenda. If you look at the polls, the consequences of this level of polarisation have been the reinforcing of the parties most deeply involved in the issue.\u201d Vidal said both Vox and the Catalan Republican Left, the region\u2019s more moderate pro-independence party, were likely to benefit from the current climate. He said Abascal\u2019s participation in the party\u2019s first debate on public television had helped normalise Vox\u2019s narrative and allowed it to set out its stall. Vidal added that Abascal seemed to be aiming to emulate the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen by adopting \u201ca more chauvinist, European far-right attitude when it comes to economic protectionism\u201d. Earlier on Monday, Roc\u00edo Monasterio, Vox\u2019s leader in the Madrid region, headed to a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors in Seville to argue that such young people made the streets unsafe and posed \u201ca serious problem in our neighbourhoods\u201d. She was met with cries of \u201cFascists out!\u201d. The following day, her husband, Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros, a Vox spokesman, suggested \u201cforeigners are three times more likely to commit rape \u2026 than Spaniards\u201d. He was speaking after Abascal falsely claimed in the debate that 70% of gang rapes in Spain were committed by foreigners. Figures from Spain\u2019s National Institute for Statistics show that 312 Spaniards and 96 foreigners were convicted of rape last year. Berta Barbet, a political scientist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, said that while the tumult in Catalonia had undoubtedly favoured Vox, a sorpasso depended on rather more than a single party surging forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Vox rising \u2013 it\u2019s about Citizens falling,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Citizens\u2019 decline has less to do with Catalonia and more to do with its ambivalent strategy over whether it\u2019s a centrist party or not, and with its stance on negotiating with S\u00e1nchez.\u201d Barbet added: \u201cIt needed to decide whether it was a centrist party that could make a deal with S\u00e1nchez or whether it wanted to be to the right of everyone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
