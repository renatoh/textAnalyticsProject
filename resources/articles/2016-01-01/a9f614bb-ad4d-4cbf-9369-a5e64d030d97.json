Snyder announced the action on Tuesday. It makes available state resources in cooperation with local response and recovery operations. Federal prosecutors also said on Tuesday they are working with the US Environmental Protection Agency on an investigation into problems with lead in Flint\u2019s water supply. The city temporarily switched from Detroit\u2019s water system to Flint river water in a cost-cutting move in 2014, while under state financial management. Residents complained about the water\u2019s taste, smell and appearance and children were found to have elevated levels of lead. Last week, Snyder apologized and Michigan\u2019s top environmental regulator resigned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
