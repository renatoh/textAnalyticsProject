After Wales began their World Cup qualifying campaign with a 2-0 home defeat to Belgium, Coleman is already on the defensive. The main bone of contention centred around the direct style Wales employed against Belgium, although Coleman suggested that the football played under his predecessor, Gary Speed, was occasionally too predictable. \"I looked at some of the games and although there were results there was not always a plan B,\" said Coleman. \"We said for the first 15 minutes we will play in Belgium's half and we did that. We were not in any trouble and had one or two half chances. Getting the man sent off changed things, and in the second half we tried to pass and keep it more. \"We have to mix it up. Of course we want to keep the same pattern, but we have to earn the right to get in the spaces. Sometimes you have to stretch the pitch and stretch teams to get the space to pass the ball. \"We will score goals. We have creative players and we have players who can finish. We do have to put the ball in the net, we are aware of that.\" Containing a talented Belgium side was always going to be a daunting task, one that was made impossible by James Collins's red card for a rash challenge after 26 minutes. While Wales did their best to frustrate the visitors, goals either side of half time from Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen ensured Belgium left with three points. Collins's dismissal undoubtedly defined the match, although Ashley Williams felt his team-mate, who caught Guillaume Gillet with a studs-up tackle, had nothing to apologise for. \"Ginge apologised and everyone said don't worry,\" said Williams. \"It wasn't anything stupid, he hasn't punched someone in the face. He tried to make a tackle but the referee was very quick to get the red card out.\" The West Ham United defender is suspended for the away game against Serbia on Tuesday, although Joe Allen will travel with the squad after missing Friday's match with illness. Against a strong Serbia side, Wales will have their work cut out if they are to avoid a fifth defeat in a row but Williams remains optimistic. \"We know you don't qualify in the first game,\" he said. \"We could have easily thrown the towel in but we showed determination and desire. If we show that again I am sure we will get wins. \"We put pressure on ourselves to qualify. It is no good saying we had a good campaign and we missed out and we are not going to Brazil. We will go to Serbia confident. As long as we stay in the game we have match winners.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
