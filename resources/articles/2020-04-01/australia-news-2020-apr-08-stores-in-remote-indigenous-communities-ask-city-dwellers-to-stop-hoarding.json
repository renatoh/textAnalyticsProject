Mai Wiru, a not-for-profit corporation that supplies 11 community stores in remote South Australia and the Northern Territory, said stockpiling and hoarding in towns and cities had made it hard to source and supply the basics to remote communities. \u201cWe have been trying to buy toilet paper for weeks now,\u201d said the CEO of Mai Wiru, Dennis Bate. \u201cI\u2019ve had buyers out there scouring the countryside to buy bulk toilet paper and not much luck. \u201cWe have to supply 5,000 people. Thirty cartons a week is just not enough.\u201d Mai Wiru operates a weekly road train from Adelaide which takes several days to deliver to all the community stores. \u201cSo if our load is picked on a Monday, we have to make do with what we can get on that day. We get one bite of the cherry. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get it then, we are never going to see toilet paper,\u201d he said. Mai Wiru has doubled its road train service, but Bate said he was \u201cworried about how we are going to keep this up\u201d. The demand in communities was greater, he said, because so many people were sent home under biosecurity measures, but those same measures meant shipping supplies into those communities was more difficult. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the ramifications; it\u2019s quite complex. There are restrictions on who can go out to the stores. As CEO, I have to get special police permission. That takes out half of our regular freight companies, and those who remain have their own set of priorities. \u201cIt\u2019s an uneven playing ground. My long-term worry is the hoarding. That\u2019s the issue. \u201cWoolies and Coles are making a killing out of this, and the silly punters have brought on themselves. But there are ramifications for people down the line. Stop hoarding, let the manufacturers catch up and it\u2019ll all go down again. \u201cShare it out. There\u2019s enough to go around.\u201d A spokesperson for Woolworths said it appreciated \u201cthe current situation is frustrating for our customers in remote communities\u201d. \u201cThere has been an unprecedented level of demand for groceries, which has put enormous pressure on Australian supply chains. \u201cWe are working hard behind the scenes with a number of key stakeholders, including the government, to improve the situation for the benefit of these communities.\u201d Coles said it was \u201clifting restrictions on all known remote groups for Coles online deliveries\u201d, was making weekly deliveries to some communities in isolation, including Yarrabah in Queensland, and was working with the Western Australian government to provide a remote order service. The Central land council said the big supermarket chains also need to lift item restrictions so that remote communities could buy in bulk and spare themselves trips into towns like Alice Springs for supplies. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt met with the big supermarkets, the NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, and community store operators to guarantee supply chains for the expected months-long duration of the Covid-19 lockdown. Wyatt said there was a lot of goodwill to resolve the situation. \u201cWe will meet again in two weeks time to see how the goodwill is translated into outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a focus on the top items stores provide to communities, and the challenge also is the changing season, which means that if there\u2019s rain, then some of them will have challenges in having access to food supply. So we\u2019ll look at options as to how we get food into those communities. \u201cAs the chief minister [Gunner] said, this is about the way in which governments at all levels ensure food continuity to Aboriginal communities in remote areas. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked them to stay in their communities so we also have to ensure that food safety or access paramount.\u201d Wyatt said he has asked the national Covid-19 coordination commission to work with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to monitor the cost of goods in remote communities, and ensure that enforcement measures are communicated to store operators."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
