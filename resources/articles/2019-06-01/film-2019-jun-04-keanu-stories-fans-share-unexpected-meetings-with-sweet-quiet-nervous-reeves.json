A casual chat about motorbikes at the end of night of bartending. A wink in a Sydney cinema. Fans of Keanu Reeves have been sharing stories of unexpected, fleeting interactions with the actor. The outpouring of stories intensified after a New Yorker story in which writer Naomi Fry proclaimed Reeves to be \u201ctoo good for this world\u201d and the \u201cunlikely antidote to everything wrong with the news cycle.\u201d The story ended with an endearing anecdote about the author spotting Reeves squeezing into a chair in the cheap seats at a local theatre. In a tweet, Fry dubbed him \u201cAmerica\u2019s crush\u201d, although commentators were quick to point out the Canadian/American actor, who was born in Beirut to a British mother and a Chinese-Hawaiian father, is in fact \u201cthe world\u2019s crush\u201d. Reeves is back in the spotlight thanks to his role in the new Netflix film Always be my Maybe. In the film he plays a version of himself as lead actor Ali Wong\u2019s new boyfriend, and gets to deliver lines like: \u2018The only stars that matter are the ones you look at when you dream.\u201d After the editor of the New Yorker website put out a call for Keanu Stories, fans jumped online to share their encounters. But there were already many circulating, thanks perhaps to Reeves frequently travelling alone. One Twitter user remembered meeting the actor 15 years ago after the success of The Matrix as a bartender and described the actor as \u201cthe nicest of people\u201d. \u201cWe talked guitars, motorcycles and scotch for about 30 minutes,\u201d he wrote. PJ Quint recalled bumping into him in New York City: \u201cI was almost at my apartment building in NYC, and Keanu was walking toward me. I look at him and it registered who he was, he smiled, gave a little wave and said, \u201cHey, how are you?\u201d It was a quick moment of connection, but I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\u201d This was quickly seconded by Lauren Murdoch: \u201cI had the same moment, in a restaurant in Sydney. Never forgotten it either.\u201d New Zealand actor Melanie Lynskey said she hung out on the fringes of a party with Reeves and talked about animals. \u201cHe asked if I had any photos of my dog in costume. (I did.) He seemed like a very beautiful soul from that brief interaction.\u201d Amanda Meynke said she worked with Reeves on reshoots of the John Wick film and once \u201ctold him shyly how much his work meant to me in my life.\u201d \u201cHe was incredibly kind to me, thanked me so genuinely, kissed me on the cheek.\u201d Australian author Rosie Waterland remembered when she was a struggling university student working at a Sydney cinema when Reeves appeared. Waterland was charged with escorting him to the stage and said Reeves appeared \u201cso sweet and quiet and nervous.\u201d \u201cI was holding a cinema torch and was way out of my depth. He turned to me, while an entire cinema full of people were cheering for him, and said, \u201cwish me luck\u201d and I laughed, because I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. \u201cSo I said, \u2018you won\u2019t need it.\u2019 And he looked at me, winked, and said, \u2018wanna bet?\u2019 Then he walked down to the front of the cinema, charmed everyone in the fkn room, and left.\u201d Her story prompted a slew of replies. Amber Robinson wrote about serving Reeves at a bistro in Sydney, saying he was \u201cvery sweet and apologetic and super polite\u201d after realising there was no table service and he had to order at the counter. Karina shared her story of seeing him play in his band Dogstar in the Western Australia capital Perth in the mid 90s: \u201cHe dropped his water bottle. I picked it up, handed it to him, touched his hand. He said thank you. Bliss.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
