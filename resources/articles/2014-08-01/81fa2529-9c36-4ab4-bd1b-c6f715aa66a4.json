As well as setting Blake, Byron, Keats, Binyon and the Earl of Rochester, the Sussex-born composer also wrote some of his own texts, sometimes using a pseudonym. The mood of these songs is wistful, fairly conventional and often with intricate piano parts, elegantly played by Stephen Barlow. Mark Stone's performances are assured and persuasive. A sensitive Old Etonian, of frail physical and mental health, Quilter's talent tends to be dismissed as \"English Edwardian\", though he lived until 1953. You'd have to be a serious devotee to need the full collection, but this Volume 2 is full of pleasures, not least the song cycle To Julia, to poems of Robert Herrick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
