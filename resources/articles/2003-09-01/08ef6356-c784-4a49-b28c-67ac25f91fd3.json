Crestor was approved by the US food and drug administration last month and will go head to head with Lipitor, the world's best-selling drug, which recorded sales of $8bn (\u00a35bn) for Pfizer last year. AstraZeneca would not be drawn on how much it plans to spend on marketing Crestor - \"whatever it takes,\" chief executive Tom McKillop has said in the past - but City analysts forecast the sum could reach $1bn in the first year. Even that figure, however, might be dwarfed by Pfizer's spending in defence of Lipitor, which is thought to have had a promotional budget of $2bn in each of the last two years. The battle could spill on to American television screens under rules that allow direct advertising of some prescription medicines. Pfizer, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, has a much larger salesforce at its disposal - 11,000 staff compared with AstraZeneca's 6,500. Yesterday's formal launch means AstraZeneca's staff can now visit doctors and healthcare practices to promote Crestor's claimed clinical superiority. \"There has been sampling in the last few weeks, but now our sales representatives are out there talking to doctors and establishing Crestor in the medical community,\" said a spokesman. The market for cholesterol-lowering drugs is seen as one of the most attractive for pharmaceutical companies. It was worth $13bn last year and about 36 million Americans are reckoned to suffer from high cholesterol, although only 23% of potential patients are being treated. Crestor has already been launched in several countries, including Britain, and has rapidly achieved market shares of 30% in some cases. That figure is regarded as out of reach in America, where 20-25% would be seen as a success in Pfizer's backyard. The uncertainty over AstraZeneca's chances is reflected in City forecasts of Crestor's peak annual sales, which range from $2bn-$5bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
