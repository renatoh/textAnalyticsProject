Dr Paul Finlay has been working at Sydney airport screening passengers with health checks, including pregnant women and people with dementia and severe mental health conditions. He said state and federal governments had not responded well to the crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s no coordination between even departments at the same level of government. The interaction of state and federal government is hostile.\u201d Finlay said while it was true the majority of coronavirus cases in Australia to date had come from returned travellers, a small number of returned travellers now being taken to hotels for enforced quarantine should be allowed to quarantine in their homes on compassionate grounds. Finlay said health workers could flag vulnerable people, such as the elderly or severely mentally unwell, with NSW Health for exemption from the enforced 14-day quarantine in city hotels. \u201cUntil today the ministry of health had told me that everyone I\u2019d flagged as vulnerable was given their exemption,\u201d Finlay said on Saturday. \u201cToday I learned this was a lie. It hadn\u2019t actually been done.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all still in the hotel rooms. And it\u2019s worse than prison. They have cramped rooms with windows that don\u2019t open, no balcony and are not allowed to leave even for some fresh air and exercise. Some hotels aren\u2019t cleaning the rooms for the two weeks and aren\u2019t offering people products to clean their own bathrooms.\u201d Finlay said one person had been told they could have a food package delivered by a family member. The family member included a bottle of wine, which the hotel confiscated. He described those in the hotels as \u201cdetainees\u201d and said many did not have access to a laundry. One hotel, the Hilton, was charging some $20 to do the washing, he said. This is not covered by the government. One of the vulnerable passengers Finlay flagged for medical exemption from staying in a hotel was a man who had survived being in a fifth floor hotel room in Kathmandu during the deadly Nepal earthquakes in 2015. He\u2019d been trapped for some time with dead bodies nearby. \u201cUnderstandably he didn\u2019t want to end up in a hotel with windows that didn\u2019t open, no balcony and no scope for getting out of the room to exercise and feel normal,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cHe held grave fears for his mental health and I agreed. I escalated his case a few times to the ministry of health with no communication back to me and no action taken.\u201d Another vulnerable woman found out she was approximately 15 weeks pregnant. Due to being on a remote island prior to returning to Australia, she has so far had no antenatal screening and this is her first pregnancy. She had arranged to be seen by an obstetrician in her home city of Hobart but was unable to travel to Tasmania due to strict travel restrictions which meant that, even after completing two weeks isolation in NSW, she and her husband would be required to do the same again in Tasmania. \u201cShe works in an emergency service,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cShe was very anxious about not having any antenatal screening until the end of another four weeks. She reported to me that she spoke to the onsite doctor and that she is not allowed out of her room so she could get antenatal screening.\u201d Finlay also shared concerns for other quarantined arrivals, including a woman with a newborn baby who he said is a high risk for developing post natal depression, and an older couple where the husband has dementia. \u201cThey were to be isolated in a hotel despite having a home in Sydney,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cThe unfamiliar environment and confinement is likely to result in behavioural disturbances for her husband.\u201d He said a paraplegic woman with a catheter and needing an air mattress so that she doesn\u2019t get pressure sores, and who has a carer who helps her with tasks such as bathing, was not allowed to be driven to Wollongong to her house that her friends had ensured was stocked with supplies for her return. \u201cTo my knowledge she is still languishing in a hotel in Sydney,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience sit and wait for the authorities to rectify any of this because there\u2019s evidence that they know and still won\u2019t do anything. I\u2019d prefer to be in prison than turn a blind eye after days of trying through official channels to have all of this addressed.\u201d A remote and regional tropical emergency doctor, Amy Neilson, who was among the doctors placed into quarantine after returning from Peru, agreed with Finlay\u2019s assessment of the situation in hotels. Communications have been changing regularly particularly between police and the hotel, with lack of clarity given to those in isolation, she said, adding there was uncertainty on the date and time people will be allowed to return home. Neilson said people would cope better if they were given clear information. \u201cSome people really are struggling and lonely, particularly older people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disorientating for them.\u201d She added that \u201cpolice are running\u201d the hotel operations. \u201cThe communications between border force, police, the hotel and the army appear to be a mess,\u201d Neilson said. NSW police and the Hilton have been contacted for comment. In a statement, NSW Health confirmed The Public Health Order has provisions for exemptions. The department did not respond to questions around how many of these exemptions had been granted. The statement said the minister of health has delegated the authority to grant exemptions to a panel of experienced doctors. \u201cEach exemption request is individually considered, and a significant number of exemptions have already been granted,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEach hotel has on site nursing and a daily medical presence. Travellers can access this medical service. Requests for exemptions are also escalated by this avenue. Applications for an exemption on medical or compassionate grounds can also be made by travellers to the Australian department of health, which sends these onto NSW Health.\u201d Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
