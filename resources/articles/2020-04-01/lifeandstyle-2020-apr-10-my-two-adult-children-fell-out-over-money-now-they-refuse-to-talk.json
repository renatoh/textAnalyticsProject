They are in their mid-30s, with spouses and young children. They fell out over money, but I think the real reason was sibling rivalry. I fear this fracture will be permanent and that I will never have all my children at my table for dinner again. It saddens me that the cousins won\u2019t know each other, or their aunt and uncle. I am close to my siblings and am afraid my children are making a huge mistake by alienating each other. I have let them know my feelings and urged reconciliation, but to no avail. Family unity is so important to me; I cannot believe they have so little regard for it. How can I help them forgive each other and move on? Neither will consider counselling, and both have partners who support their views. \u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
