We must also take into account the other ways unions operate. Most obviously, there are the number of ballots for strikes and industrial action. Since these became required by law, unions have cleverly used them as a way of creating bargaining leverage. By balloting where a \"yes\" vote is likely, unions are able to use ballot mandates to get most of what they want without taking the action. This must surely be a case of \"thinking\" trade unionism. Secondly, no data, government or otherwise, exists on the frequency of industrial action short of a strike, such as overtime bans and work-to-rules. But my impression is that this is not insignificant, again suggesting a thought-out approach is being used by unions. So despite all the shackles, unions have innovated as they have seen fit. If the legal shackles were removed we would probably see a rise in strikes, but we would also see a rise in employers giving in before strikes took place. Prof Gregor Gall University of Hertfordshire Anne Perkins implies that because unions now rarely organise mass strike action and are impotent when it comes to preventing the closures of businesses, they are therefore redundant. The media always choose to portray unions through strikes and conflict. However, it is the largely unseen and unheard daily negotiations about pay, terms and conditions, as well as health and safety, that are the unions' bread-and-butter work. Without these behind-the-scenes negotiations, there would be no equal-pay claims, pensions or decent maternity leave, and more workers would be maimed and killed at work (at present Britain has one of the best records in this area). Every year thousands of workers who have been underpaid, unfairly dismissed and bullied at work are represented by trade unions at tribunals, and millions of pounds in compensation is won for them. As long as there are employers and workers, there will be a need for trade unions, even when, as now, they have been shackled by Thatcher and her successor Blair. Brunhild de la Motte London The articles by Lord Steyn (This all-powerful government is prone to creeping authoritarianism, April 22) and Anne Perkins underline an increasing trend within British society towards the emasculation of the power of ordinary citizens to alter their circumstances. We witness the powerlessness of trade unions to defend workers' interests in the face of a labour market rigged against them. We see the continuous encroachment of civil liberties by successive governments through attacks on the jury, appeal and detention laws. Local government, once the counterweight to centralised power, has been neutered since the Thatcher era, while big business buys influence through political donations. Membership numbers show that the political parties have become divorced from the populace. Meanwhile, election turnout rates tell us we have no faith in the political system to deliver, but these are dismissed by our politicians as public apathy. Keith Maton Llanellen, Monmouthshire Lord Steyn's otherwise excellent wake-up call on the threat to our democracy unfortunately reiterates the myth that Hitler was democratically elected. In the last relatively free elections in November 1932, the Nazis lost around 2m votes, and the combined vote of the Communist and Social Democratic parties was far more than the Nazis'. The Nazi party had no majority in parliament, even with allies, but Hitler was nevertheless made chancellor by Hindenburg under pressure from big business and the ruling elite, who were frightened of the growing strength of the socialist parties. Even after the Reichstagsbrand, the banning of the Communist party and the illegal exclusion of its elected MPs, the Nazis were unable to win a majority in the elections of March 1933, despite being the largest party represented in the Reichstag.
