The detainees, who have either committed no crime or completed a prison sentence for a crime already committed, are facing the same \u201cshielding\u201d protocol as those serving a prison sentence with health conditions that put them at risk, the Guardian understands. The Home Office is only supposed to detain people if there is a realistic prospect of removing them from the UK. Yet two people who have received letters telling them to stay in their cells for the next three months come from countries on a Home Office list of about 50 that officials cannot currently remove people to because of coronavirus. A letter from the Home Office\u2019s director general of immigration enforcement, Tyson Hepple, dated 26 March, says: \u201cThe Home Office is, as always, mindful of our legal obligations in respect of immigration detention to ensure that it is used sparingly and only where removal or deportation is a realistic prospect.\u201d The letter from G4S, sent to vulnerable detainees in Brook House immigration removal centre, near Gatwick airport, on 27 March instructs them to avoid face-to-face contact for at least 12 weeks. It states: \u201cDo not attend any gatherings, do not attend work, activities or the gym.\u201d It gives no firm guarantee about access to fresh air and exercise, saying it will be arranged by officers \u201cas the regime allows\u201d. While it is unknown exactly how many detainees are deemed to be vulnerable and have received letters, those incarcerated estimate that in Brook House around 80 are detained and more than 10% have received them. One man, who served a 10-month sentence for burglary and received the letter because he has a compromised immune system, said he was very upset about the prospect of solitary confinement. \u201cI\u2019m scared for my life in here. If just one person brings Covid in we could all get it. I know there is lots of Covid outside detention too but if I get it I want to die at home with my family by my side, not in a cell in Brook House,\u201d he said. A second man, who served a three-year sentence for grievous bodily harm, said: \u201cI have asthma. I have good days and bad days. It will be very hard to stay in my tiny cell for three months. I know that I could die from Covid in detention 100%.\u201d Another detainee, who does not have underlying health issues, said many in detention had committed minor crimes or no crime at all and should be released during the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m a trained engineer. I\u2019ve lived here for 27 years and I was convicted for cultivating cannabis plants,\u201d he said. Bella Sankey, director of the charity Detention Action, said: \u201cDetention is a double and discriminatory punishment which is unjustified at the best of times and in the worst of times it\u2019s a brewing public health disaster.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe high court ruled just last week that the Home Office are taking sensible, precautionary measures in relation to coronavirus and immigration detention. This is in line with the public health guidance and these measures are in place to protect staff and detainees during these unprecedented times. \u201cPublic protection is paramount which is why we are working to maintain law and order and protect the public from high-harm individuals. This is why the vast majority of those currently in detention are foreign national offenders.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
