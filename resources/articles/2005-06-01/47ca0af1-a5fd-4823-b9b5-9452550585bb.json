The cross-channel train operator believes the number of people using the service will rise to 14 million a year within five years of the switch to the \u00a360m interchange at St Pancras. The new station in the north of the capital will open to international services in 2007, making it easier for passengers travelling from the north to catch Eurostar trains. Paul Charles, director of communications at Eurostar, said the 14 million target was \"achievable\", though still well off targets set before the service started running. \"Forecasts made in the late 1980s and early 1990s were ridiculous,\" he said. \"They assumed people would travel from Manchester to Barcelona by train.\" Under the original predictions, Eurostar would already have broken through the 14 million barrier. Mr Charles also said that Eurostar was still looking at proposals to start running direct Eurostar services to Amsterdam and Cologne, though not for a further three years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
