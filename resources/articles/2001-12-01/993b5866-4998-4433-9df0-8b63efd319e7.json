In the latest strikes, Israeli attack helicopters reportedly fired five missiles at the Palestinian police station in the middle of Ramallah, a few hundred meters from the West Bank headquarters of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. No serious injuries were reported. Earlier today, in military moves apparently calculated to have symbolic significance, Israeli forces took over the house of one of Mr Arafat's top lieutenants and bulldozed the transmitter of the official Palestinian radio station, putting it off the air for several hours. Three Palestinians were killed by the day-long Israeli military actions, which included incursions into the West Bank town of Ramallah. Palestinian Health Ministry officials said 40 people were hurt in Gaza. Elsewhere, the Israelis hit a security building in the West Bank town of Jenin and fired missiles at a structure in Gaza City, witnesses said. Ambulances were attending the scene. The Israeli military would only confirm that there were attacks in Ramallah and Jenin but would not elaborate. The new round of violence and retaliation brought the conflict to a fresh crisis and appeared to sink immediate hopes for a US-brokered truce. Israel is taking military and political actions after Palestinian militants attacked a bus in the West Bank on yesterday, killing 10 Israelis, while two suicide bombers blew themselves up next to Israeli vehicles in Gaza. Arguably the most ominous move was the Israeli security cabinet's announcement that contacts would be cut with Mr Arafat, charging that he was \"directly responsible\" for yesterday's attacks on Israelis. Mr Arafat's spokesman called the Israeli retaliatory strikes \"an official declaration of war\", and another top Palestinian official said they had rendered the Palestinian Authority unable to fulfil its commitment to crack down on terror. A decision to close the offices of the militant Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups was suspended. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Israeli announcement complicated the mission of peace envoy Anthony Zinni. The official said Mr Zinni would ask the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to clarify whether the Israeli ban covered indirect contacts with the Palestinians, such as using himself as a conduit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
