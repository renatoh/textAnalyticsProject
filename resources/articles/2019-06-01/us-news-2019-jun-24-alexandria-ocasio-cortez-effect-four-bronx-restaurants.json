When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 the New York congresswoman, progressive rising star in the Democratic party and local Bronx celebrity \u2013 tweeted about her visit to MangiPasta earlier this month, Cerrato saw an almost immediate uptick in visitors. \u201cThey were like \u2018you know why I\u2019m here?\u2019 I\u2019m like \u2018no\u2019. Even take out, they\u2019re like \u2018I want to try your food because Ocasio-Cortez mentioned you, said you have quality food,\u2019\u201d says Cerrato, 33. The restaurant, which specialises in homemade pasta, was one of four Bronx establishments recommended by Ocasio-Cortez, 29, after she was asked for tips of local food spots in her home borough on Twitter \u2013 describing MangiPasta as \u201cSUPER fresh, handmade Italian, family owned\u201d. Embarking on a tour of the four restaurants, the Guardian spoke to Cerrato one lunch time last week, as she paused intermittently to bid farewell to customers. Cerrato said she did not immediately recognise the Bronx-born congresswoman, but her husband Estevan, who is American, and their customers soon did. \u201cThe clients that we had that night here, they took a few pictures,\u201d says Cerrato. \u201cShe was very nice, she even got up, she went to the table of some customers who were asking her questions, she stood there, spent some time with them, so very polite, very nice person.\u201d Cerrato said she likes that the politician has not lost touch with her local community since relocating to Washington after taking office in January. \u201cI understand that, because I\u2019m from Naples and I don\u2019t forget my background,\u201d says Cerrato. The next two stops on the list \u2013 both described by Ocasio-Cortez as \u201cincredible\u201d \u2013 are a 30-minute bus ride away in Parkchester, where she used to live. At family-run Mexican restaurant Taqueria Tlaxcalli, there\u2019s a friendly atmosphere as staff chat and the chefs make a burrito order in the open kitchen behind the bar. Rosa Gomez, 23, whose father opened the restaurant 13 years ago, says she has seen Ocasio-Cortez in the restaurant a couple of times. Her order, she says, is \u201cusually a chicken burrito, not spicy, and she usually cuts it in half and shares it with someone\u201d. Gomez, who has lived in the area her whole life, likes the attention she is bringing to the area. \u201cParkchester itself, the Bronx, is not very talked about and when it is it kind of has a negative aspect to it, so I feel like it\u2019s definitely a positive attention that she\u2019s bringing to the Bronx and to areas like ours.\u201d At Neerob, a Bangladeshi and Halal Chinese restaurant across the road, owner Mohammed Khokon greets the Guardian enthusiastically from the table where he\u2019s eating lunch. After offering tea and samosas, he says that Ocasio-Cortez used to live across the road from him. \u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful lady. She came before the election to our restaurant.\u201d He says he is sceptical of most politicians but likes new people entering mainstream politics. \u201cI don\u2019t like it to be same guy over and over \u2026 I see their promising, they never keep their promise,\u201d he adds. But Ocasio-Cortez, he says, is standing up for her community. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting for us.\u201d When she comes, he says, she \u201clikes everything\u201d they serve at the restaurant. AOC is not his only high profile visitor he\u2019s had. On the wall is a framed picture of Khokon and the late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. Khokon, who started out as a delivery person when he moved to New York in 1991 from Bangladesh, launched his business in 2009. When he started he made $200 a day, but now he says the restaurant is successful. \u201cI never give up,\u201d he says. In five to six years, the Bronx, he predicts, will be \u201canother Manhattan\u201d. The final stop on the tour, Louie &amp; Ernie\u2019s Pizza \u2013 a \u201ctop NYC pizza spot\u201d, according to Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 is a short subway journey away. Owner John Tiso, 52, said Ocasio-Cortez has been there a couple of times \u2013 after appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and most recently two weeks ago. His daughter Victoria, who has a photo of herself with Ocasio-Cortez on her phone, says her order consists of: \u201cChicken slice, peperoni slice, regular slice, it\u2019s usually the same thing.\u201d Tiso, who bought the business with his brother 32 years ago, says the Bronx is becoming known as a foodie destination. \u201cBefore it was mostly always pizza, Chinese food, but now we\u2019re starting to see a lot of different urban foods like Cuban food, Mexican food, Puerto Rican food, starting to see a lot of that. So it\u2019s getting a really diverse neighbourhood here. No more just bars and hamburgers and fries.\u201d While he doesn\u2019t necessarily see eye-to-eye with Ocasio-Cortez on politics, he is happy that the community is being represented. \u201cI\u2019m glad that she\u2019s doing a lot of stuff for the community. I know that she\u2019s trying to help all areas, all aspects that the other gentleman didn\u2019t do. I don\u2019t agree on all her stances, but you know I think she\u2019s doing the right thing \u2026 for now,\u201d he adds with a laugh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
