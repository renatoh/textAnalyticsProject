The Granada executive chairman declared his position was not under threat and City analysts agreed it was not the right time for him to go. They said investors might be sceptical about Mr Allen's long-term position but the current tough trading conditions were not his fault. Mr Allen received a roasting from shareholders today but remained confident of his position. \"I have had meetings with my top 10 shareholders and that issue has not been raised,\" he told Reuters. One analyst said: \"There's a lot of distaste in the market because of where Granada's share price is. A lot of money has been wasted on ITV digital. \"People are sceptical about whether Mr Allen is the man to lead the combined ITV forward. \"A two-year rolling contract is rather bull-market and probably not appropriate in these conditions. The industry standard is nearer a year. I can see why people thought that might not be appropriate.\" The analyst's remarks come after a difficult annual general meeting in which shareholders protested against Mr Allen's a two-year contract. Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis, said it was important the heads of Granada and Carlton remained in place during the vital period ahead of a potential merger. \"ITV is a very complicated animal. It's not the right time to get rid of [Carlton boss] Michael Green or Charles Allen. You certainly need one of them to get the combined company through the merger process and the integration if it goes through,\" he said. Mr Richards added: \"It's a difficult and highly complicated business and you need someone with experience.\" Simon Mays-Smith of JP Morgan said today's protest was \"a good thing for shareholder activism\". \"The current tough trading is not Mr Allen's fault, the vote is more of a reflection of the significant investment in, and the ultimate failure of, ITV Digital for which he was partly responsible,\" said Mr Mays-Smith. \"He has to prove he can run the core ITV business. Some evidence that the core ITV franchise is beginning to improve. We should not write them off. If Mr Allen can prove he can turn the business around he should get credit for that.\" Another analyst, who preferred not to be named, predicted problems in the future. \"I don't think Charles Allen has much support in the government,\" he said. \"Government people think ITV has milked the franchises and not invested, with some pretty outrageous strategic blunders along the way. There's certainly a case for saying Allen should go.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
