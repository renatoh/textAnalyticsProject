Mexico\u2019s attorney general, Arely G\u00f3mez, said that Penn\u2019s journey to the rugged Sierra Madre mountains was \u201cessential\u201d to tipping them off to the drug lord\u2019s whereabouts, according to Reuters. Her comments came after the Mexico City daily El Universal published a series of photographs that appeared to show Penn and the Mexican actor Kate del Castillo as they arrived in Guadalajara and prepared to fly on to the encounter. Castillo, who had starred as a fictional cartel boss in a TV soap opera, was first approached by one of El Chapo\u2019s lawyers in October 2014, with a request from the drug lord for advice on making a feature film based on his life, the newspaper said. Castillo and the lawyer Andr\u00e9s Grandos Flores then met in a Mexico City restaurant in July 2015, supposedly to discuss the payment of royalties and film rights, El Universal reported. The next time they met \u2013 in Guadalajara on 25 September \u2013 Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s legal team gave Del Castillo a \u201cspecial\u201d telephone, with which she could contact Guzm\u00e1n directly, said the newspaper, citing a Mexican intelligence report. Del Castillo returned to Guadalajara on 2 October, this time with Penn. Photographs in El Universal show Penn, wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap, meeting a group of men who took him and Del Castillo to an airstrip in Nayarit state from where they flew in a small aeroplane to El Chapo\u2019s jungle camp in the municipality of Cosal\u00e1, in Sinaloa. Shortly after the meeting, Guzm\u00e1n narrowly escaped capture in a raid, but his luck ran out on Friday when he was apprehended by Mexican marines in the coastal city of Los Mochis. According to a report by the broadcaster Televisa, Guzm\u00e1n initially eluded capture through a reinforced door hidden behind a mirror, and descending into a tunnel leading to the city\u2019s drains. The marines took 90 minutes to find the opening mechanism for the concealed door, which was hidden in a dressing room light. Items found inside the house included DVDs of La Reina del Sur, a soap opera about a female cartel boss which starred Del Castillo. Penn\u2019s rambling account of his meeting with the fugitive drug lord appeared on Rolling Stone\u2019s website on Saturday. Penn has been widely criticised for meeting Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 and giving him copy approval for the Rolling Stone article \u2013 but on Monday he expressed no regrets over the episode, telling the Associated Press: \u201cI\u2019ve got nothin\u2019 to hide.\u201d On Sunday night, Interpol said it had begun the process to extradite Guzm\u00e1n to the United States, though Mexican authorities admit the process will proceed slowly, giving the recaptured cartel kingpin at least another year in the same high-security prison he once escaped from. The head of Mexico\u2019s extradition office, Manuel Merino, told Radio Formula in Mexico City that no mechanism exists to expedite Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s extradition, and the drug lord was free to seek injunctions against the process. Lawyers for Guzm\u00e1n say they have filed six motions against extradition. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s past escapes \u2013 once in a laundry cart wheeled out of a Guadalajara-area prison in 2001 and most recently through a mile-long tunnel under his cell-room shower \u2013 were prompted in part by fears he could face trial in the US. Analysts say he was able to continue running his cartel from behind bars in Mexico and enjoyed privileges such as conjugal visits. \u201cI think El Chapo, like other big capos, fears extradition more than anything,\u201d said Malcolm Beith, author of the 2011 biography The Last Narco. \u201cHe\u2019ll never get out of a US prison and won\u2019t enjoy any luxuries there.\u201d But the extent to which the arrest will weaken El Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa cartel remains uncertain. An unverified but widely followed Twitter account in the name of Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 El Chapo\u2019s son and presumed successor \u2013 said: \u201cNothing changes here, we will continue working because as my father said, although they\u2019re shafting us we have to hold our heads high.\u201d The capture has been a boost for President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whose embattled administration has been battered by corruption scandals and questions of competence. \u201cMexico today confirms that its institutions have the ability necessary to face and defeat those who threaten the tranquillity of Mexican families,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto told a meeting of Mexican diplomats on Monday. The president also said that overall crime had dropped 12% during his three years in office and that 98 of the 122 most wanted criminals had been captured. It was a change of approach for an administration, which has previously preferred to keep quiet on issues of security in an attempt to improve Mexico\u2019s international image. Analysts says the boasting over bagging El Chapo is warranted, though not likely to last \u201cIt is a win,\u201d says Alejandro Hope, security analyst and former intelligence official in Mexico City. \u201cPrevious cartel capo captures produced an increase in the approval rating, then there\u2019s a return to the mean.\u201d Not everyone expressed enthusiasm over the capture or Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s praise for the work of Mexico\u2019s security institutions. Two-time leftwing presidential candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador contrasted the capture with the authorities to discover the fate of 43 student teachers who disappeared and are believed to have been murdered after the buses they were travelling on came under fire from municipal police officers. \u201cThey can detain El Chapo, but not able to find 43 missing Ayotzinapa students,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
