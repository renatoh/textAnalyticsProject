Trotsky: The Prophet Armed by Isaac Deutscher Trotsky: The Prophet Unarmed by Isaac Deutscher Trotsky: The Prophet Outcast by Isaac Deutscher I have not read these for years, but I found them inspiring as a student for their historical sweep, their depiction of ideas in action, and the sympathetic portrait of a brilliant and humane but ultimately doomed revolutionary. 2. Disraeli by Robert Blake Blake's book set the standard for the modern genre of political biography. It might seem a little old-fashioned today, but it is a classic which still reads as elegantly as when it first came out in 1966. 3. Gladstone Vol 1: Peel's Inheritor - 1809-1865 by Richard Shannon An immensely subtle and detailed account of Gladstone's tortuous intellectual, spiritual and political journey. This volume remains both comprehensible and convincing; I found the second volume much less so. 4. Asquith by Roy Jenkins Another classic, a perfect match of biographer and subject and a fine blend of research and political insight, written before Jenkins declined into self-parody. 5. The Young Lloyd George by John Grigg Lloyd George: The People's Champion, 1902-1911 by John Grigg Lloyd George: From Peace to War, 1912-1916 by John Grigg The early volumes of this ambitious project brought an unequalled freshness, insight and lightness of touch to a well-trawled and complex subject but, sadly, Grigg faltered before he reached the summit, and the series now seems unlikely to ever be completed. 6. Ramsay Macdonald by David Marquand It was a brave undertaking for a Labour MP in the 1960s to attempt to rehabilitate the party's most vilified traitor. Marquand's book is a revelatory account of how much Macdonald did to create the Labour party before his tragic and pathetic decline. 7. John Maynard Keynes: Hopes Betrayed, 1883-1920 by Robert Skidelsky The Economist as Saviour, John Maynard Keynes1920-1937 by Robert Skidelsky This is a true intellectual biography, tracing Keynes's thinking from its roots in late-Victorian Cambridge to its elegant flowering between the wars. It is also an intimate personal study which revealed his dangerously promiscuous homosexuality and his surprising marriage. I regret that I have yet to read the final volume. 8. Hugh Dalton by Ben Pimlott Another surprisingly intimate biography, it draws heavily on Dalton's very candid diary which succeeds in relating the ups and downs of a political career to the crises of private life better than any other biography I have read. 9. Mandela by Anthony Sampson Inevitably perhaps, Sampson is still a little reverential, but his close knowledge of South African politics makes this the most authoritative account so far of Mandela's early life and his extraordinary human and political triumph through 27 years of imprisonment. 10. Jeffrey Archer: Stranger than Fiction by Michael Crick Not a major subject, but Crick's biography is a wonderfully entertaining, meticulously-sleuthed expos\u00e9 of an apparently indestructible chancer on the fringe of politics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
