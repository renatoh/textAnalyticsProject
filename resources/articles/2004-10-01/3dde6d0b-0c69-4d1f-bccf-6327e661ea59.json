It was brilliant, with all these double meanings between the celestial entities and the birth of rock'n'roll, ie Bill Haley and the Comets. I was really nervous. I'd been writing ever since I started secondary school, but this was the first time I'd performed speaking poetry. Cath came up afterwards and was really complimentary. I'm pretty sure the poem was a load of rubbish, but it went down pretty well.Jo's always putting her poetry down but she's actually very good. I tell her it's very hard to judge yourself - let the audience decide.We began to hang out together from then on. We're both great fans of the Beat poets and The Doors and the counterculture of the Sixties. We feel the world has got a bit too cynical. We hark back to a more stimulating, revolutionary time. At the same time, we don't much like the druggie aspect of the scene.We love to go walking on the Wirral. I've got a dog, Snowy - we love taking him out in such a beautiful area. He's such an intelligent dog. We also have a shared love of the Lake District, which we've both visited with our families when we were younger. We went on holiday there last year with Snowy and some other mates - it was the most blissful time. We've gone on all the anti-war and anti-occupation marches together too.You need solidarity in the mad world of today; you need people to tell you it's not you who is insane; you need people to help put your shoulders to the wheel. Friends are what make life worth living."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
