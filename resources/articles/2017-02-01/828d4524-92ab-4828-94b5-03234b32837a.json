No longer will John C Calhoun\u2019s name disgrace the city and the university.\u201d The school is being renamed for Grace Murray Hopper, a trailblazing computer scientist who also served as a rear admiral in the US navy. Like Calhoun, Hopper, who was posthumously awarded the presidential medal of freedom by Barack Obama in November, is a Yale alumnus. \u201cThis decision, especially in these fraught times, is a monumental step forward,\u201d said Christopher Lapinig, a 2013 Yale Law School alumnus and member of the New Yale Colleges group. University officials said on Saturday that the school will not remove symbols of Calhoun on campus, such as engravings and a statue that tops the landmark Harkness Tower. It also will not discourage alumni if they want to continue associating with the Calhoun name instead of that of Grace Hopper College. In 2016, after sustained discussion and controversy, the Yale corporation decided to retain the name. \u201cThe decision to change a college\u2019s name is not one we take lightly,\u201d the Yale president, Peter Salovey, said on Saturday. \u201cBut John C Calhoun\u2019s legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a \u2018positive good\u2019 fundamentally conflicts with Yale\u2019s mission and values.\u201d Calhoun, a senator from South Carolina who was separately secretary of state, secretary of war and vice-president under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson, was a champion of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d in the years before the civil war. In 1837 he argued, beyond the rhetoric of many 19th-century pro-slavery politicians, that slavery was neither a necessary evil nor a moral conundrum but a \u201cpositive good \u2026 indispensable to the peace and happiness\u201d of both races. \u201cNever before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually,\u201d Calhoun falsely stated from the Senate floor. Chris Rabb, a 1992 Yale graduate, has spoken out against the name since his own days living at Calhoun College, when he successfully lobbied for the removal of a stained glass window depicting a black man in shackles kneeling before Calhoun. He said this week that just changing the name would do little. \u201cTo me the real issue is context,\u201d said Rabb, now an educator and state representative in Pennsylvania. \u201cHow do you contextualize the choice made in the 1930s\u201d \u2013 when the college was founded \u2013 \u201cand the choice it made ever since to keep it? \u201cWhat does it mean now in terms of Yale\u2019s connections to slavery and issues of social and racial justice in a diverse city?\u201d The controversy flared again last summer following the arrest of a black dining services worker, Corey Menafee, who used a broomstick to smash a stained-glass window at the college that depicted slaves. Criminal charges were dropped and Yale rehired Menafee, who had described the image as offensive. Matos cited Menafee as one of the reasons the administration changed course on the name. \u201cThis victory happened because of the courage of community leaders, faith-based leaders, faculty, city residents and students who came together to seek change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is New Haven at its best.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
