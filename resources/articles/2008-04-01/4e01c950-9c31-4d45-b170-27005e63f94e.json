Novo slid the ball home from close range after 27 minutes, before Burke headed the second beyond Jonny Tuffey to settle the match. Partick passed up a glorious opportunity to get back into the tie when Simon Donnelly sent a penalty wide. Donnelly later hit the bar, whereas Rangers wasted a spot-kick of their own, Daniel Cousin's casual effort being saved by Tuffey. Rangers now face another First Division team, St Johnstone, at Hampden Park on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
