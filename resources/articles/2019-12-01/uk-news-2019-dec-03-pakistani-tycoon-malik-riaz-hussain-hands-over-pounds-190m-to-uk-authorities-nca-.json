On Tuesday, the National Crime Agency said Malik Riaz Hussain had agreed to the multimillion-pound settlement that did \u201cnot represent a finding of guilt\u201d. NCA investigators secured nine freezing orders that covered \u00a3140m in funds held in UK bank accounts after allegations that the cash may have been the proceeds of crime. The money and ownership of the central London property will be handed over to the government in Pakistan, where Hussain had been charged with fraud and corruption. The freezing orders were on the cash and assets rather than against any individual. Hussain is the owner of Bahria Town, Asia\u2019s largest private property developer . He had been the subject of an unexplained wealth order, which froze eight of his UK bank accounts containing \u00a3120m the NCA \u201csuspected to have derived from bribery and corruption overseas\u201d. Included in the \u00a3190m settlement is a grade-II listed 10-bedroom mansion that includes a cinema, swimming pool, gym, steam room and spa. The seven-floor property on Hyde Park Place was previously listed for rent on property website Zoopla for \u00a386,667 a month. On Tuesday, Hussain tweeted: The NCA described Hussain as the boss of \u201cone of the biggest private sector employers in Pakistan\u201d. Bahria Town specialises in properties that replicate famous buildings such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and even whole squares, such as Trafalgar Square in London. They are aimed at wealthy Pakistanis as well as immigrants. The agency first froze \u00a320m of Hussain\u2019s funds last December, and in August secured a court order that covered \u00a3120m across eight further bank accounts. It is the largest amount frozen in a NSA investigation since the Criminal Finances Act 2017 came into force. The legislation gives police greater powers to crack down on people attempting to launder money through the UK. The NCA is also investigating the assets of a former Azerbaijani state banker\u2019s wife, who was found to have spent \u00a316m in a decade-long spending spree in Harrods dep. Duncan Hames, director of policy at the anti-corruption charity Transparency International UK, said: \u201cWe welcome news that UK law enforcement have secured a substantial amount of funds for return to the people of Pakistan. \u201cThe size of funds in this case is a step change from previous efforts and shows the importance of changes introduced by the Criminal Finances Act 2017. Although there is scant information about the specifics of the case, returning seized funds to the country of origin, as is proposed, is an obligation under the UN convention against corruption.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
