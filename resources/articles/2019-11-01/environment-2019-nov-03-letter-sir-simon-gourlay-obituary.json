While he was still deputy president, in 1983, he agreed to brief our freshly appointed staff of some 25 journalists in a converted church in Knightsbridge, central London. Just as Simon entered the room, a thunderstorm broke and amid claps of thunder and shafts of lightning he looked the very prophet. He maintained close contact with us as president, strengthening our coverage of union affairs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
