Rough sleepers defy anti-begging law", "bodyText": "Sporadic downpours have not stopped Mark*, penny whistle in hand, trying his luck near cashpoints in the centre of Birmingham. The 47-year-old rough sleeper sits crossed-legged playing a jig opposite a supermarket entrance. \u201cI\u2019m not begging, I\u2019ve found the loophole,\u201d he says sincerely after a member of the public drops a pound in his plastic container. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anyone for anything. I\u2019m providing entertainment.\u201d But the law is not on Mark\u2019s side. A police officer could decide he is violating section 3 of the Vagrancy Act, which outlaws begging in England and Wales, and arrest him. If convicted of the offence, Mark would be judged a criminal \u201crogue and vagabond\u201d, liable to a maximum fine of \u00a31,000. In Birmingham, arrests and charges under the Vagrancy Act have fallen markedly in recent years despite a surge in rough sleeping. West Midlands police made 17 arrests for begging in a public place in 2018, compared with 141 in 2014, according to figures obtained by the Guardian under a freedom of information request. But rough sleepers in the city centre say police regularly use the law to move them on. It is an experience shared in other parts of the country, where banning orders for begging convictions under the act have prevented rough sleepers from getting emergency accommodation in freezing weather. Nationally, there were 1,320 prosecutions under the Vagrancy Act in 2018, a 6% increase from the previous year. Pudsey, who left care aged 15 and moved to Blackpool for a fresh start, told a report by the charity Crisis \u2013 which is calling for the repeal of the act \u2013 that a banning order from the town centre meant rough sleepers could not access local homelessness services. \u201cSince coming to Blackpool I\u2019ve now had 13 charges under the Vagrancy Act and I\u2019ve also been taken to court twice for it. Five of those warnings I was even asleep when they gave them to me, so how could that have been for begging? I just woke up to find it on my sleeping bag,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf the homeless in town have been given Vagrancy Act papers now, and most of them have been fined about \u00a3100 and then given a banning order from the town centre. If they get caught coming back, they get done again and could go to jail, but that means all those people can\u2019t get into town to use the few local services there are for rough sleepers.\u201d In Birmingham the council is planning a new approach, turning to civil measures as use of the Vagrancy Act falls. It is considering using public space protection orders (PSPOs) under which people found begging or obstructing footpaths in the city centre could face a \u00a3100 fine. More than 60 councils in England and Wales already do so. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking ridiculous. What\u2019s the point in that?\u201d Mark says incredulously. \u201cWell I\u2019ll have to beg for more money to get it. How is a beggar going to pay \u00a3100? That\u2019s just an excuse to put people in prison.\u201d He has a point: although violating a PSPO is only a civil offence, not paying the fine can begin a cycle that ends in criminalisation and prison. Mark and his dog are sitting opposite cashpoints, which would be considered aggressive begging under some PSPOs in other parts of the country. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anyone for anything, I\u2019m just playing a whistle. Aggressive begging is all those advertisements in the window saying buy this, buy that,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was to beg, I don\u2019t see how asking people for money from this distance could be considered aggressive. I mean, people are quite happy to ignore me and be aggressive to me. Tell me to fuck off, \u2018get a job you tramp\u2019.\u201d Birmingham had the second highest number of recorded rough sleeper deaths in 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available. But apocryphal tales of professional beggars who are not homeless making hundreds of pounds a day in the city have hardened attitudes to rough sleepers. Asked about fake beggars, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not what we are picking up. There are people with mental health problems that have basic accommodation of some sort and head into the city centre for company. Some of them do some begging at the same time.\u201d Jamieson hit national headlines last year for his opposition to posters put up by his police force that said giving money to beggars could inadvertently kill them by supporting drug addictions. He called the posters \u201cinsensitive\u201d and \u201ccrass\u201d. He has given his \u201creluctant\u201d support to the planned PSPOs on condition that the council provides extra support for rough sleepers. John Cotton, a Birmingham councillor overseeing the plans, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken any final decision about this.\u201d He said the measures were about dealing with antisocial behaviour that put off shoppers and affected businesses. \u201cA red line for me is that while we need to take measures to tackle antisocial behaviour \u2026 I do not want to end up targeting and criminalising vulnerable homeless people,\u201d Cotton said. In the city centre, Mark has had enough of talking and returns to playing penny whistle to the sodden, sparse high street, not caring if it could be a criminal act. \u201cIf I can\u2019t make money off this, how am I meant to fucking live? Really, how am I meant to? Should I just go to prison so I can stay alive? Fuck that.\u201d * Mark\u2019s name was changed to protect his identity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
