This is difficult enough but I need to be at home in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on the 15th to receive my A-level results and then leave at least a day to sort out any problems that may arise if I've missed my grades. Could you advise on the cheapest, quickest way to get to Salamanca within this time frame? Also, any suggestions as to what I should try and see in the Castille and Le\u00f4n region? Charlie Sutherland, Newcastle Salamanca is easily accessible by train from Madrid, so if you're in a hurry, head for the capital by plane. Leaving Newcastle on the 18th should mean you have ample time to sort out any issues relating to your exam results - or lose the sore head after getting the right grades. A cheap flight is the best option; it will probably involve a change of planes in Europe. ebookers (0870 010 7000) offers tickets from Newcastle to Madrid for around \u00a3160 depending on the time of day and who you fly with. You can either overnight in Madrid (www.madridman.com is a fun starting point for research into that city) or press on to Salamanca (www.renfe.es for train times, fares and bookings). You'll make it in plenty of time to scrum down. Salamanca itself has a wild nightlife, due in part - as you'll soon discover - to the large student population, as well as enough architectural masterpieces to keep you occupied for a long time. A few hours away is the world heritage city of Segovia, with its Roman aqueduct, late Gothic cathedral and imposing fortified alcaz\u00e1r (which inspired Walt Disney when building his fairytale castle). Le\u00f3n offers more historical wonders mixed with pleasant modern development. Other highlights of the region include Avila's old centre and the Sierra de Gredos mountains for outdoor activities. Salamanca is European City of Culture this year; for more on this great destination, check out www.salamanca2002.org. Sailing to Toronto I've spent the past two weeks searching the net for how to get to Toronto for a wedding in May 2004 by sea (I don't like flying). Time is not a problem as I'm retired, so a tramp steamer or cargo boat to the mainland - either the US or Canada - would be acceptable. The QE2 seems to do a New York run, but is there any other shipping company apart from Cunard? Leaving from and returning to continental Europe - Hamburg or Rotterdam - would not be impossible either, but I'd prefer the UK. Mavis R. Smith, Gateshead Canada Maritime offers passage on a freighter to Canada. Its service leaves roughly three times a month from Thamesport, Kent, to Montreal. The outward journey makes a few stops at ports in Europe and takes 10 days; the return trip is direct and takes seven days. The cost is \u00a3995 either way. Though there are no firm guarantees that the company will still be doing this in 2004, it is a well-established route. Strand Travel (020 7836 6363) is the UK booking agent for this crossing and many other freighter journeys. It advises that you should be prepared for a lot of spicy food as the chef cooks to the tastes of the Indian crew. By the time you're travelling, Cunard (0800 052 3840) should have the new Queen Mary 2 making its second crossing from Southampton to New York - there are sailings scheduled in both directions in May 2004. This new vessel will be an absolute whopper - see Cunard's site or above for full details. Travelling on the Queen Mary 2 will cost from \u00a31,669 each way, but you will be sailing in the most luxurious setting imaginable. Book early if you're keen. Dogs in France I'd like to go to France next year with my dog (who has been microchipped) but I don't know how to find somewhere that caters for dogs. Also, will he need a passport? We expect to go through the Channel tunnel and drive south. Kate and Mike Millington, by email There are lots of companies offering canine-friendly accommodation. UK-based www.preferredplaces.co.uk and www.hidays.co.uk both allow you to search listings according to destination - there are plenty of options for France. Pets Welcome is a US-based company with extensive listings for France. You will need to get your dog his own passport. The fact that you've already had him microchipped will make the process easier, but you'll still need to arrange a vaccination against rabies, a blood test to check the vaccine has taken, and a certificate stating that he is fit to travel. You need to start this procedure about seven months prior to departure. For all you need to know about the PETS travel scheme, see Defra's website or call the PETS helpline on 0870 241 1710. The excellent www.dogsaway.co.uk has sections on pet travel insurance, suggested travel routes and listings for vets overseas. New Orleans by wheelchair My husband is confined to a wheelchair with MS. He's a great jazz fan and his lifetime ambition has been to visit New Orleans. I have just inherited enough money to realise this ambition. Hot, humid weather is the worst possible climate for MS sufferers so when would be the best time to go? Are there any authentic jazz bands/venues left? How wheelchair-accessible is the old quarter and does anyone conduct historic walking tours? Can you advise on companies who specialise in holidays for people with disabilities? Mrs S.E. Hall, Lincolnshire In terms of an agreeable climate you'd be best off heading to New Orleans in the clear and temperate months of September and October. If you want to bypass the crowds, try and avoid the first Monday in September and the second Monday in October - both public holidays. You'll be pleased to know that there are plenty of authentic jazz venues still operating. Preservation Hall on St Peter Street draws large crowds not only thanks to the talented line-up but also the great atmosphere - the hall is fairly dilapidated but this just adds to the appeal. Please note, however, that no food or drink is served on site (see the website for further details). Palm Court Jazz Caf\u00e9 (1204 Decatur St) is another favourite, popular with both tourists and locals. It has a packed and varied calendar and its own restaurant and bar. Facilities for the disabled are being improved around the city and you'll find that many hotels are suitable for wheelchair users. You may, however, experience problems getting around. The Riverfront Streetcar Line has platform ramps and wide doors but the St Charles Avenue Streetcar Line has yet to be modified. You may find the French Quarter is the least accessible, largely due to uneven pavements and very few easy-access facilities. Lots of companies offer walking tours. For historical information try Historic New Orleans Walking Tours (00 1 504 947 2120). The website has a host of information about travel with disabilities, including worldwide agents and destination-based facts. Over to you... readers' feedback In response to Ian Hall's query about a rail trip to Eastern Europe (Letters, 4 August): Although trains are undoubtedly the best (and cheapest) way of seeing the Czech and Slovak Republics, it's worth bearing in mind that even their 'InterCities' are about as fast as British suburban trains. Beautiful though eastern Slovakia is, I would suggest going straight to Poprad from Bratislava. From there you can catch a bus over the Polish border to Zakopane and travel on to Krak\u00f3w by train. There are two direct trains a day from Krak\u00f3w to Prague; the journey takes nine hours, including an overnight option. However, breaking your journey in the pretty medieval city of Olomu\u00e7 will save your legs and possibly your sanity. Note that due to engineering work on the Prague to Ostrava mainline, some delays are inevitable. Steve Baines, London \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall and Rachel Suddart from Lonely Planet address as many as possible here. Email travel.tips@observer.co.uk or write to Escape, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
