England will finish second if Wales secure the grand slam by defeating Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday but Jones is focused on finishing the campaign on a high and avenging last year\u2019s 25-13 loss at Murrayfield, which was the start of a run of five successive defeats. \u201cWe cannot control what happens in Cardiff but we can control how we play against Scotland,\u201d said the head coach after victory over Italy took England past 100 points in their two home matches this tournament. \u201cWe know we will have to be at our absolute best against them. \u201cIt is their game of the season and we know how they carried on after they beat us last year. I remember everything that was said then and all we have to worry about next week is playing well against Scotland. I was really pleased with the response against Italy after the defeat in Cardiff, even if we did leave two or three tries out there.\u201d Jones said he accepted the blame for what happened in Cardiff, when England collapsed in the final 13 minutes having held a 10-3 lead at half-time, with the half-backs George Ford and Dan Robson left on the bench. \u201cI did not coach the side well against Wales and I was filthy about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have adjusted quicker and I let down the players by not doing so. It was a very disappointing final 30 minutes in Cardiff and it is hard to recover from something like that. Players get a lot of criticism and you have to stick to your guns.\u201d Jones picked a hefty three-quarter line against Italy, who were unable to cope with the pace and power of Manu Tuilagi and Joe Cokanasiga, although he will be having words with the latter who for much of the match carried the ball in one hand while fending off tacklers with the other. \u201cOne-handed stuff is great for you guys [the media] but sometimes it is better with two,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe is a young kid with great potential. When we took him to Argentina in 2017, he could not complete a training session but now he can challenge Israel Folau as the best player in the air. I am delighted for Manu after his long time out with injuries. The game is getting more and more physical and it is an advantage to have big players who are skilful and move fast.\u201d Italy slumped to their 21st consecutive Six Nations defeat. Their head coach, Conor O\u2019Shea, praised the resilience of his side on an afternoon when they lost three centres and finished with a prop in the back row. \u201cThey could have thrown in the towel but kept getting stuck in against a powerful side who, in my opinion, are the best in the Six Nations,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
