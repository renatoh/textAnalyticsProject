It sees the UK's change of approach as \"a major and unwelcome shift\". Unwelcome for the commission, perhaps, but good for those who want to see EPAs work for poor people. These potentially disastrous free-trade deals have only got so far because no EU member state has yet given them the scrutiny they deserve. The UK has taken a strong leading developing its own position, but that will not be enough. It must now use its EU presidency to table a full review of the EPA talks to ensure development is at the heart of the debate and reconsider the mandate, if necessary. It must ensure the old-style mercantilism and pressure that still characterises the commission's approach to trade negotiations with poorer countries does not continue to put the lives and livelihoods of 750 million of the world's poorest people at risk. Paul Chandler Chief executive, Traidcraft Charles Abugre Head of policy, Christian Aid Tom Sharman Trade policy officer, ActionAid Phil Bloomer Head of advocacy, Oxfam GB Matt GriffithTrade policy analyst, Cafod The Conservative party sees the British presidencies of the EU and G8 this year as a unique and historic opportunity to take decisive action on global poverty. It is essential the government is not blown off course by lobbying from the notoriously protectionist EU. EPAs should be used as vehicles for development, not to promote selfish mercantilist interests which do not accord with free and fair trade. The election campaign showed the consensus that now exists on development issues. The stumbling blocks are likely to be other EU and G8 countries, notably the US. Tony Blair has a lot of political capital with the US. He should be willing to draw down some of this to help make poverty history in 2005. Andrew Mitchell MP Shadow secretary of state for international development Research by the Institute of Development Studies undermines the claim that the UK position is incompatible with WTO requirements. Applying the commission's own interpretation of WTO rules, we find that most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean could continue to protect sensitive sectors under the EPAs - unless the commission uses force majeure to prise markets open. But we also find that EPAs raise concerns for African regional integration and government finance. It is a pity that instead of discussing these issues, the commission prefers to stifle minor dissent by a member government. Christopher Stevens IDS, University of Sussex Peter Mandelson has certainly been talking a good game on trade and development, but it is clear that he and his commission colleagues have so far shown no interest in pro-poor policies and every interest in helping European multinationals. The UK government must respond. It needs to demonstrate that its change of heart on EPAs will be actively pursued in Europe. It must also reverse its vociferous support for other damaging free-trade agreements on industrial tariffs and trade and services. Peter Hardstaff Head of policy, World Development Movement For centuries Europe has taken from the world. Now the Eurocrats want to stop attempts to level the playing field. This isn't my vision of the EU, Mr Mandelson. Malachy Pakenham London Colney, Herts"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
