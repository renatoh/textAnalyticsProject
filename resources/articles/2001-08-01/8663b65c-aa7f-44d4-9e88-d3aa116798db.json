In her new play at the Cottesloe she seeks to update Hamlet, apply the superstring theory of physics to human relationships and write a comedy of country matters. But the play lacks a single, governing, passionate idea. Jones's hero, Felix Humble, constantly echoes Hamlet. He is a Cambridge fellow who has returned to his Cotswold home on the death of his father, a biology teacher and bee keeper to find that his mother is contemplating marriage to her lover. And the jittery Felix is confronted by his own discarded mistress who, unbeknown to him, has borne his child. Felix even has Hamletesque chats with a ghostly gardener. The problem with using Hamlet is that it deals with state turmoil as well as dysfunctional families. Jones answers the point by wheeling in big issues. The idea of the bee colony as utopian metaphor is constantly invoked. Felix is desperately searching for a way of resolving the tension between Einsteinian relativity and quantum mechanics; Jones implies that he needs to apply the scientific \"theory of everything\" to his own life and reconcile intellect and feeling. I like plays that deal in big ideas. The problem is that Jones jumps promiscuously from one to another and that the gap between the Cotswold antics she displays and the intellectual world she invokes is often ominously large: it's a giant leap, for instance, from the big-band bore Felix's mother is about to marry to the big-bang theories that preoccupy Felix. John Caird's production, sumptuously designed by Tim Hatley, also distances the play from economic reality. I kept wondering how a biology teacher could have afforded a garden that looked as it belonged to the National Trust. But Jones has created a great central role in Felix, which Simon Russell Beale avidly seizes. He gives the impression of a man ill at ease in the world: his movements are never fully co-ordinated, his clothes look as if they belong to another body, he giggles nervously when seduced. This is a richly imagined performance complemented by those of Diana Rigg as his waspishly perplexed, sexually glamorous mother, Cathryn Bradshaw as his one-time mistress and Marcia Warren as a devoted neighbour. But, beautifully acted as the play is, you feel that Jones's Cotswold comedy is slightly too frail a barque to carry so much intellectual cargo. \u0095 In repertory. Box office: 020-7452 3000.
