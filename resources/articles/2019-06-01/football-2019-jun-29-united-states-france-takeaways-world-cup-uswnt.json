It was the biggest match of this Women\u2019s World Cup yet, both in the hype leading up to it and the quality on the field. The defending champions continue to look unstoppable while the hosts will feel they missed an opportunity to win over their home nation more. Here are the key takeaways from the game. Jill Ellis gets it right, despite her critics It was a big decision. Lindsey Horan, long the USWNT\u2019s preferred starting No 8, would not be starting against France. She wasn\u2019t injured \u2013 it was a pure coaching \u2013 and Samantha Mewis would take her place. Why? \u201cJust playing Sam \u2013 that was kind of it,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI think Sam is in-form.\u201d It\u2019s hard to quibble with Mewis\u2019s form. She had a strong game, disrupting France\u2019s play and serving as a reliable passing outlet, and generally did what she needed to do, other than a dive that could\u2019ve been booked for simulation. But Horan is arguably the best, most impactful midfielder in the world \u2013 at least when she is given the chance to find the game. For the Portland Thorns, she\u2019s been their single most influential player with everything flowing through her, and it\u2019s why she was named the MVP of the American domestic league, the NWSL, last year. If the US had lost many would\u2019ve pointed to Ellis\u2019s decision not to start Horan. Ellis and her coaching staff also did a fine job managing the game, making necessary adjustments to keep France from working their way into the game, including dropping from a 4-3-3 to a more defensive 5-4-1 shape. \u201cThe coaching staff thought the momentum was shifting in France\u2019s favor, so they wanted to make it more difficult for France,\u201d Becky Sauerbrunn said. \u201cAdding more people in the backline allowed us to spread out a bit more and take away even more of their flank space.\u201d Although the US has tested it out several times before in the middle of friendlies, it still took French coach Corinne Diacre by surprise, she admitted. Mark that down as a win for Ellis. Alyssa Naeher acquits herself well enough It was perhaps the biggest storyline before this World Cup began, and it wouldn\u2019t go away through the USWNT\u2019s first four games: the US had a goalkeeper problem. It wasn\u2019t just that Alyssa Naeher can\u2019t match up to her predecessor, Hope Solo, who was a generational talent in net. It was that Naeher kept making worrying mistakes. Against Chile, she wildly misjudged an effort to rush an attacker and let in a goal that was, luckily for her, waved offside. Against Spain, it was another mistake \u2013 a miscommunication in passing the ball to defender Sauerbrunn, who was under pressure, that allowed Spain to score an equalizer. But against France, easily the best attacking team the US has faced yet, Naeher stepped up in the big moments, making four saves on the day and looking steady when cutting out crosses or coming off her line. There was a nervy moment from Naeher in the 58th minute \u2013 she came out and misjudged a cross, giving Eugenie Le Sommer an open chance on goal, that went wide. But to Naeher\u2019s credit, she didn\u2019t let the moment rattle her and continued to be a decisive presence in net for the remainder of the game. France falter again, but it\u2019s the burden of being host After Friday\u2019s quarter-final, both sides agreed that France were, in many ways, the better side. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret we have to get better on the ball,\u201d Megan Rapinoe said. \u201cPlaying better with it, better offensively, better in our possession and our passing \u2013 they were clearly much better than us in that tonight.\u201d France doubled the US in attempts, 20 to 10, and they controlled the possession, 60% to 40%. But the US still found a way to win. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever dominated the US that much,\u201d captain Amandine Henry said afterward. \u201cBut still, dominating them still isn\u2019t the same as winning.\u201d There is a narrative about this French team that they haven\u2019t managed to shake: they crumble under the pressure, and there\u2019s a reason they\u2019ve never done better than fourth place in a World Cup. Henry denied the pressure of being host got to the French but every single team hosting the Women\u2019s World Cup has been knocked out in the quarter-final round \u2013 except for the United States in 1999. The pressure looked far more comfortable for the US than it did for France. As Ellis said before the match: \u201cOther teams visit pressure, but we live there.\u201d The loss means that France are now only not out of the World Cup, but they have also failed to capture one of the European slots for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Asked whether France\u2019s finish was a failure, Diacre did not try to defend their performance. \u201cIt is a failure,\u201d Diacre said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should shy away from that. We didn\u2019t win, we didn\u2019t qualify [for the Olympics], so from a sporting perspective, it really can\u2019t be anything other than a failure.\u201d A warning to the field: The US can\u2019t score first The Americans have scored first in every match of this World Cup \u2013 and not just first, but quickly. The USA\u2019s opening goals have happened, so far, in the 12th, 11th, third, seventh and fifth minutes. The US have never lost when scoring first in a World Cup, now through 39 matches. France, meanwhile, has lost every time they conceded first in a World Cup. That\u2019s not a coincidence. The American game plan is clearly to score as early as possible, taking an ultra-attacking posture in the opening minutes of a match. That could be the time for opponents to capitalize, but instead they have only tended to look overwhelmed by the USA\u2019s aggression. In France case, Rapinoe\u2019s fifth-minute goal changed the game and forced the hosts to try to chase the Amerians, a position they didn\u2019t want to be in. \u201cWe had obviously analyzed the statistics, which said the US tend to come out firing in the opening 15 minutes, and we paid very dearly for switching off there,\u201d Diacre said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
