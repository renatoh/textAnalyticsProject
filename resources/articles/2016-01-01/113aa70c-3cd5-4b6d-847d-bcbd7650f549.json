The S&amp;P 500, which closed at 1,890 points, suffered its worst day since September and has fallen by 10% since its November peak taking it into \u201ccorrection\u201d territory, something that has not happened since August 2014. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 364 points, or 2.2%, to 16,151, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 159 points, or 3.4%, to 4,526. This deepened the New York stock exchange\u2019s already worst start to a year on record. Wednesday\u2019s stock market declines were triggered by new figures showing US gasoline stockpiles had increased to record high, which caused Brent crude prices to fall as low as $29.96, their lowest level since April 2004, before settling at $30.31, a 1.8% fall. The oil price has fallen by 73% since a peak of $115 reached in the summer of 2014. Industry data showed that US gasoline inventories soared by 8.4m barrels and stocks of diesel and heating oil increased by more than 6m barrels \u2013 confirming the forecasts of many analysts that a huge oversupply of oil could keep prices low during most of 2016. Analysts said that growing fears of a weakening outlook for the global economy, made worse by falling oil prices, was behind the steep falls. Some oil analysts this week predicted that the price could fall as low as $10. In recent days several analysts have warned that the global economy could suffer a repeat of the 2008 crash if the knock-on effects of a contraction in Chinese output pushes down commodity prices further and sparks panic selling on stock and bond markets. Amid the turmoil, a $48bn bond offer by brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev \u2013 to fund its takeover of SAB Miller \u2013 attracted a record $110bn of offers as investors sought relatively safe investments. Earlier in the day China\u2019s stock market fell more than 2% after officials played down the significance of better-than-expected trade figures for December, saying exports could sink further before they find a floor. The numbers surprised the markets, where economists had been forecasting a much weaker reading. Traders were also cheered when the numbers were translated into the weakening local currency, the yuan, which showed exports reaching a record value in December, up 2% on the previous year. They appeared to offset gloomy predictions of a stock market rout in 2016 made by several investment bank analysts, including RBS\u2019s credit chief, Andrew Roberts. Roberts warned earlier this week of a possible 20% drop in stock markets and a period of turmoil that would knock the prospects for global GDP this year. His advice to investors was to sell everything except high quality bonds. China\u2019s stock market rallied almost 20 points initially, but comments by officials that weak demand for Chinese goods would continue to hurt the country\u2019s economy in 2016 sent the Shanghai composite down 2.4% by the end of the trading period to 2949. Some economists argued that the figures showed trade with China was beginning to stabilise after a year of contraction. Daniel Martin, an economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cChina\u2019s trade data support our view that, despite the turmoil in Chinese financial markets, there has not been a major deterioration in its economy in recent months. \u201cMeanwhile, another large trade surplus last month provides a cushion for the People\u2019s Bank in the face of soaring capital outflows.\u201d Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit said: \u201cChina\u2019s improved trade data in December will probably act to reassure global investors unnerved by the recent volatility in the country\u2019s financial and foreign exchange markets. \u201cThe data is in line with other indicators that suggest China\u2019s economy is stabilising on the back of sustained stimulus measures.\u201d The country\u2019s global trade surplus widened by 21% to $60bn in December. Over the whole year it was $594bn. The country\u2019s trade surplus in December with the European Union, its biggest trading partner, increased 36.8% to $15.6bn. The surplus with the US contracted 6% to $19.4bn. Some analysts questioned the trade figures, saying they were suspiciously buoyant after an unexplained 10% surge in exports to Hong Kong. That rise meant that the former UK colony imported more from mainland China than the US. Iris Pang, a senior economist for Greater China at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg that the increase in exports to Hong Kong and China\u2019s imports from the city probably indicated \u201cfake invoicing\u201d. The invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said. Albert Edwards, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who has predicted that global stock markets will tumble this year, said moves by the Chinese authorities to devalue the yuan to boost exports would have profound consequences for the global economy. He said that despite a large trade surplus, the huge capital flight from China, as savers take their cash out of the country, was forcing the hand of regulators. \u201cI have always thought that in order to revive a spluttering Chinese economy, the authorities would have to devalue, but not just because an overvalued exchange rate was squeezing their manufacturing sector. \u201cInstead I felt that an overvalued exchange rate had steadily undermined competitiveness to the point that it had undermined the balance of payments. This was compounded last year by an accelerated capital outflow as anti-corruption measures intensified, and an unprecedented unwinding of dollar-denominated borrowings by Chinese corporates. All these factors have combined to take the Chinese balance of payments into deep deficit.\u201d Optimists also pointed to a rise in Chinese crude imports to a record 7.82m barrels in December, up more than 21% from November, as a reason to believe that China\u2019s ailing manufacturing sector was gearing up for better days. It appeared, however, that the world\u2019s second-biggest oil consumer was simply taking advantage of the oil price rout to stock reserves and increase exports of refined products."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
