The five-game series continues in two days time at Wellington. Thanks for your company for the first leg of this T20I OBO double header. I\u2019ll be back in three hours for Australia v Sri Lanka at the MCG. And I can tell you, it\u2019s looking a treat. Until then! Tim Southee speaks. \u201cAll three elements of the game not at our best. Score wasn\u2019t a bad one and felt competitive at halfway but were off with the ball and in the field.\u201d Eoin Morgan\u2019s turn. \u201cGame was won in the first innings; bowlers did an absolutely outstanding job, especially men on debut Sam Curran and Pat Brown. Took advantage of a two-paced wicket and were chasing 20 below par. Vince played outstandingly well. Have had a great time in New Zealand so far in the lead up. Very happy with the depth, as shown by having three debuts today. We need 15 or 17 guys who can start in a playing XI to win a World Cup. All our planning is geared towards the World Cup next year. A couple of places up for grabs in that 15-man squad and now new guys get to stake their claim. Isn\u2019t happy with how he hit them, though.\u201d James Vince is player of the match. He speaks. \u201cNice from a personal point of view to make a contribution and get the tour off to a winning start. Would like to have the ball again where he got out but happy with how he played. Morgs did a good job to see it home.\u201d Never in doubt. Not really. There were times when the required rate was edging towards nine an over, but the home side needed early wickets for that to matter in this day and age of T20 chasing. Vince\u2019s innings was defining, striking the ball beautifully from the get-go, his 59 in 38 balls made when the game was there to be won, stroking seven fours and two sixes along the way. Eoin Morgan (34* from 21 balls) did the rest, with Sam Billings (14* off 11) finishing it with him. 18.3 overs: England 154-3 (Morgan 34, Billings 14) Target 154 The captain seals it with a six over midwicket off his opposing number. They\u2019ve done it with nine balls in hand. Nicely chased. 18th over: England 144-3 (Morgan 24, Billings 14) Target 154 Top shot, Morgan down to Ferguson, lifting him over mid-off for four. Nothing wrong with the ball - it\u2019s resourceful, experienced batting. His bad luck continues later in the set, winning Billings\u2019 inside edge, running away for another four. Ten runs left, two overs to get them. 17th over: England 133-3 (Morgan 18, Billings 9) Target 154 Sodhi is a wicket taker. If he can get rid of Morgan, New Zealand have a sniff. If they don\u2019t, they can\u2019t win. Simple. Forget about the skipper for now though, Billings has backed himself to play a full-blooded reverse sweep and has nailed it, helping ease any squeeze. Two more to midwicket and another in that direction, then Morgan finishes with one to cover. Ten off it and the captain is back on strike. All over. 16th over: England 123-3 (Morgan 16, Billings 1) Target 154 Billings soaks up one, two, three Santner dots before retaining the strike with a single to finish the over and the spinner\u2019s spell - he took 3/23. 31 from four overs the job left for England captain and his new deputy. Good grief, you talk a bloke up! Look, it was still a fantastic innings, probably a matchwinning one, but he\u2019s popped a legitimate half-tracker straight into the hands of Martin Guptill at midwicket. He really should seen this chase through to the end. Oh well. 15th over: England 121-2 (Vince 59, Morgan 15) Target 154 When you see James Vince bat like this, it is hard to understand how he hasn\u2019t bossed international cricket at all levels. This time around, he\u2019s charged at Southee before flat-batting him over his head for SIX. That sounds brutal, and it was, but he managed to make it look well pretty. Earlier, Morgan showed his own class with a steer not too dissimilar to the shot his number three played in the previous over, beating everyone with immaculate placement. 33 off 30 needed. 14th over: England 108-2 (Vince 52, Morgan 9) Target 154 Right, Southee has turned back to his speedster Lockie Ferguson. This might be just about last roll of the dice stuff. It doesn\u2019t bother Vince though, who leans back and carves another lovely boundary, splitting the gap and beating the sweeper. Gorgeous batting. It takes him to 50 in 33 balls - the defining innings of this game. It\u2019s Morgan\u2019s turn to now get into the act, happily uppercutting over the cordon to narrow the gap yet further. Ten off, making 34 from the last three. 13th over: England 98-2 (Vince 47, Morgan 4) Target 154 Vince has owned this chase from the moment he walked out at the fall of the first wicket. In the previous over, he took the initiative at an important time. This time around, he\u2019s backed himself to smash Kuggeleijn over the long-on rope and has delivered with ease. Big. Later in the over, the seamer tried to go upstairs at the Hampshire captain but didn\u2019t get it anywhere near high enough, gifting him another four. It makes 13 off the over, the task now 56 from 42. 12th over: England 85-2 (Vince 35, Morgan 3) Target 154 Just a Sodhi is edging towards another frustrating over for England, James Vince plays a couple of lovely strokes on the trot. He\u2019s down the track to the leggie, driving him through the air into the gap at cover for four - shot. Next ball he waits, goes back and forces another four with perfect timing. 11 off it, leaving England 69 in eight overs. 11th over: England 74-2 (Vince 25, Morgan 2) Target 154 Southee returns to Kuggeleijn, who is far more effective this time around, going for just four singles as Morgan opens his account. Clever from Santner! The spinner spotted Bairstow making room and pushed it through a touch quicker. The opener went through with his premeditated shot anyway, picking out the hosts\u2019 best fielder at deep midwicket. Not quite level pegging yet but not far off it. 10th over: England 70-2 (Vince 23, Morgan 1) Target 154 9th over: England 63-1 (Bairstow 32, Vince 19) Target 154 Yep, those kind of overs. Vince smashes Sodhi straight down the ground and Bairstow sweeps him with ease. Ten off it. Your move, Tim Southee. 8th over: England 53-1 (Bairstow 27, Vince 14) Target 154 Santner is bang up for this, vocal throughout his set, which goes for just the four singles and ends with three accurate dots. England are still only a couple of hefty overs away from breaking the back of this, but the Kiwis will be well in it themselves if they can get Bairstow asap. \u201cThere are teams and leagues here,\u201d adds Julian Menz of cricket in Sweden. \u201cMet an Aussie who had played for the national team. I used to turn out for the local team a few years back, but the oppostion consisted mainly of Indian ex-pats, and I am useless facing twirlies. I met my Swedish wife in London, and she scored points (runs?) early by pretending to be interested in cricket when I interupted a Hampstead Heath-to-Camden walk with a long stop at the Bull and Gate in Kentish Town to watch the cricket (2001, forget which series). Her parents still get confused between cricket and croquet.\u201d That\u2019s a great pub for a Sunday roast/session. 7th over: England 49-1 (Bairstow 26, Vince 11) Target 154 Some players can look the part the moment they walk into any game, and Vince is one of those. His second boundary is just as attractive as his first, this time timing Sodhi through cover off the back foot. Three further singles makes seven from it. But New Zealand need wickets. 6th over: England 42-1 (Bairstow 25, Vince 5) Target 154 Vince plays a beautiful shot off the back foot to immediately open his account All told, ten runs and a wicket from Santner\u2019s first over. England have gone at seven an over through the power play and now require exactly eight an over from here to win. I like those even numbers. Spin does the trick, Malan dancing but slicing to backward point. 5th over: England 32-0 (Bairstow 20, Malan 11) Target 154 So close to another of those ridiculous Guptill diving catches, unable to drag down a one-handed effort at backward square. Malan gets four for it. Otherwise, it\u2019s another very good set from the veteran seamer. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Adam.\u201d begins Gavin Twedily. I like that opening. Please go on. \u201cThere is something special about an overnight OBO. Admittedly, it\u2019s only 11 pm here in a very wet Montreal, but I\u2019ll be seeing this game out before turning in. I mention it\u2019s raining in Montreal because it was deemed by the city of Montreal to be too wet for the traditional trick or treat. Yes, they cancelled Halloween! It will now take place tomorrow night when hopefully the costumed weans won\u2019t melt. And unlike Julian in Sweden, I\u2019m drinking cheap red Aussie wine and can say cheers! to you and all of the cricket loving night owls.\u201d Cheers to you. I realised something last night. Given my girlfriend is having an actual baby in February, my dedicated opposition to all things Halloween is going to have to end in about four years, isn\u2019t it? 4th over: England 26-0 (Bairstow 19, Malan 6) Target 154 Malan\u2019s turn, lifting Ferguson over mid-on for a boundary of his own to start the new over. Oh, and I did Bairstow a disservice in the previous set: one of his boundaries, the second, actually went for six not four. Bairstow isn\u2019t far away from adding another boundary, driving hard out of the slot but straight to mid-off. Good fightback from Ferguson. 3rd over: England 21-0 (Bairstow 19, Malan 1) Target 154 Kuggeleijn is more appealing to Bairstow, the opener breaking the shackles with a controlled drive down the ground for four before clipping over square leg for another. He makes it three for the over when pulling a slower ball into the gap at midwicket - easy peasy; stand and deliver. Oh, make it four - crunching a square drive past point. 18 off it. 2nd over: England 3-0 (Bairstow 1, Malan 1) Target 154 Lockie Ferguson, everyone\u2019s favourite player from the World Cup (now that Shakib has been sullied), is sharing the new ball. Malan gives the strike back to Bairstow, who finally gets a run from his eighth delivery, cutting a single to the sweeper at point. He\u2019s too quick for Malan with a full ball; they appeal for lbw but it has pitched outside leg. He\u2019s immediately up at 90mph, two singles the lot for England\u2019s openers. The start the hosts needed defending this middling total. 1st over: England 1-0 (Bairstow 0, Malan 0) Target 154 As Southee begins, the camera pans to Ben Stokes, who is watching the game from the hospitality tent with his family. Fair enough, too. Good start, getting to movement away then finding Bairstow\u2019s inside edge with consecutive deliveries. Five dots now, followed by a legside wide, denying him a maiden. But the skipper closes it out with another delivery demanding defence from Bairstow. Fine work. The players are back on the field. Jonny Bairstow is opening with Dawid Malan. The captain Southee has the ball in his hand. PLAY! That shouldn\u2019t be enough. Granted, the track did hold up a bit, which didn\u2019t help the Blackcap bats, but England did plenty right with the ball from the very start. We\u2019ll find out in 15 minutes. \u201cGreetings from Sweden,\u201d writes Julian Menz, \u201cwhere I am currently up late trying to translate an academic paper from Swenglish to English. After the joys of summer, I had completely forgotten about the NZ jaunt. Sweden is not the greatest place for live cricket coverage, Summer consisted of TMS and the wife\u2019s family wondering why I was screaming \u201dSTOKES!! YES!!\u201d when I was supposed to be grilling and not throwing my beer in the air infront of our impressionable 4-year old daughter. Was following the baseball last night (under-rated sport in my opinion) but glad to have the cricket back. Adam, thanks for being there for us cricket-loving night owls. If I had a beer I\u2019d say Sk\u00e5l. It doesn\u2019t work with lemon mineral water, but it\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d Great to have you with us, Julian. There is definitely something special about an overnight OBO. Plenty to come in November. 20th over: New Zealand 153-5 (Mitchell 30, Santner 1) Pat Brown would have won a lot of new fans for that performance, getting out of the 20th over on debut giving six runs away and no boundaries. Really well done. England need to go at 7.7 an over in their chase. Brown earns his first international wicket, Bairstow taking the very same catch that Vince put down in the previous over. Added style points too, completing the take with an athletic dive. 19th over: New Zealand 147-4 (Taylor 43, Mitchell 26) Vince drops Taylor at deep midwicket. It was hit hard and low but the Hampshire stylist usually has a dependable pair of hands. \u201cPaul Collingwood will not be amused,\u201d says Nasser Hussain of the fielding coach on tour. Taylor responds to the let off the only way he knows how: hammering Jordan over midwicket for six to being up the 50 partnership between this pair. Jordan responds well though, a dot and a single to cover. 2/28 from his four with Brown to bowl over 20. 18th over: New Zealand 138-4 (Taylor 35, Mitchell 25) Tom Curran\u2019s stock delivery at this stage of an innings is that back-of-the-hand number, which he lands so consistently. With pace off, well wide of the off-stump, neither man can beat deep point early on. But when he goes full and straight, Mitchell responds with a conventional, and blistering, straight drive for four. He\u2019s really looked the part since coming to the middle. Curran goes back to Plan A with his final two balls and gets out of the over giving up nine runs - he\u2019d take that. These two have put on 45 in 29. Jordan and Brown to finish it off. 17th over: New Zealand 129-4 (Taylor 32, Mitchell 19) Jordan does as you would expect, landing his full balls in a shoe box, so Taylor gets resourceful in the crease before delivery to make some room, slapping firmly past the bowler for four. It\u2019s the sort of stop Jordan often makes off his own bowling but his hand doesn\u2019t get down in time. A very bad delivery follows, a full toss on the pads of Mitchell, clipped with ease for six. 170 is still in range if these two see it out. NOT OUT! After about 25 replays, the TV ump is satisfied Taylor hit the ground rather than the ball. Dot ball; play on. IS TAYLOR CAUGHT BEHIND? Jordan thinks he found and edge with a quick, wide yorker. It was given not out so they have sent it upstairs. It looked like the clock expired but they\u2019re taking a look. 16th over: New Zealand 116-4 (Taylor 26, Mitchell 12) This is what Brown is mostly here for: his mad skillz at the death. It works a treat, neither batsmen able to really free their arms in response to deliveries that are typically dying as they reach the crease. But Mitchell gets out of the over with a bang, lofting a checked-drive over long-off for six. \u201cThat\u2019s perfection,\u201d says Nasser on telly, noting that he was able to back his timing, hitting with the wind. 11 off it. 15th over: New Zealand 105-4 (Taylor 23, Mitchell 4) Taylor brings up the New Zealand 100 with a very fine leg glance, beating the man on the 45. There is no doubt that the 35-year-old will be required in next year\u2019s World T20, one of the early IPL superstars. Determined running from Mitchell keeps the board ticking in the right direction for the locals, with a couple to midwicket. Can be finish the Tom Curran over with a bang? Nup. Instead, Taylor is nearly run out with an athletic dive-and-throw from the bowler. He\u2019s been very good. \u201cNot 19-7?\u201d asks Simon Clark. \u201cI thought England only won 19-7? Oh, wrong sport.\u201d Being a Melburnian, I\u2019m not qualified to comment on the sport you are referring to. Indeed, it\u2019s against the law. 14th over: New Zealand 96-4 (Taylor 17, Mitchell 1) Daryl Mitchell is the new man and has to find a way to go hard from the get-go. That\u2019s not easy against a bowler of Jordan\u2019s skill though, England\u2019s most experienced operator allowing just three singles after the wicket. He\u2019s unlucky there, right? Seifert miscues Jordan\u2019s full toss to Bairstow at midwicket and immediately signals to the umpire that they should check it and they do. The TV ump takes a couple of views of the replay and sticks with the original call. Felt high to me. 13th over: New Zealand 93-3 (Seifert 32, Taylor 15) Taylor\u2019s experience is on show when capitalising on a Rashid delivery that\u2019s only slightly off the mark, sweeping expertly for four. With that boundary banked early in the over, they\u2019re happy picking out the sweepers for the rest, adding ten risk-free runs from it. 160? 170? 12th over: New Zealand 83-3 (Seifert 30, Taylor 7) Slammin\u2019 Sammy Curran is back for his final over, and gets through it giving up just seven runs in ones and twos, operating exclusively in slower balls. 11th over: New Zealand 76-3 (Seifert 29, Taylor 2) The veteran Taylor in at No5, off the mark to long-on after missing Rashid\u2019s wrong\u2019un first up. Just four runs from the successful over. Just when de Grandhomme looked well placed to shift gears, he\u2019s miscued Rashid down the throat of Vince at deep midwicket. 10th over: New Zealand 72-2 (Seifert 27, de Grandhomme 19) Brown again, who is taking the pace off each ball until he slams a bouncer in at full tilt. A lot to like. But de Grandhomme\u2019s patience has run out, electing to climb into the next shorter slower ball, waiting so long for it to reach him that he only had one hand on the handle when contact was made, still strong enough to clear the square leg rope. 9th over: New Zealand 61-2 (Seifert 26, de Grandhomme 9) Better from Adil Rashid, the wrong\u2019uns biting harder than in his first over. Granted, it all comes after Seifert lifts him around the corner for four to start the set, but it looked better. And we all know that wrist spin is all about how it appears. Why else would you do it? 8th over: New Zealand 53-2 (Seifert 20, de Grandhomme 7) Pat Brown is let down from his first ball in international cricket, Gregory turning one into three with a misfield. He\u2019s straight back on it though, beating de Grandhomme with a clever little legcutter. We see a knuckle ball later in the over, very nearly pushed to Morgan at extra cover by Seifert. Nasser is a huge fan. Five from it. Nice start. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Steve Richards. \u201cLovely to see NZ cricket again on live TV - they have nice \u201cstadia\u201d - better than the half-empty \u201cenormo-domes\u201d when Aus are/will monster Sri Lanka.\u201d Couldn\u2019t agree more. They will do decent numbers here tonight because of the massive Sri Lankan community in Melbourne, but as a rule, I wonder whether some of the smaller venues should be looked at for T20Is at this time of year? Food for thought. 7th over: New Zealand 48-2 (Seifert 16, de Grandhomme 6) Adil Rashid is back for his first bowl for England since the World Cup Final. He gives de Grandhomme a chance to free his arms early in the over with a short wrong\u2019un, put away with easy to square leg for four. Five singles around the sweepers makes nine from it. Just when Munro looked to have got it together, he\u2019s given Morgan an easy catch at midwicket, clipping a low full toss to the England skipper. The perfect way to end the power play for the visitors. 6th over: New Zealand 39-2 (Seifert 13) 5th over: New Zealand 36-1 (Munro 20, Seifert 11) Shot! Tim Seifert has a big opportunity here at No3 with Williamson resting and he\u2019s into his work here, slamming Sam Curran\u2019s short ball, off the front foot, well into the stand. It inspires Munro, who dances at a slower ball later in the over, clobbering it over long-on for a second six in the over. Make it three, the best of them, Munro getting down on one knee to lift Curran over the fine leg boundary. 21 off it. [Superintendent Hastings] Now we\u2019re cooking with gas. [/Superintendant Hastings] The TV wideshots of Hagley Oval are a real treat. One of my favourite grounds on the circuit, that\u2019s for sure. Of course, Lancaster Park was the international venue in Christchurch before the 2011 earthquake. 4th over: New Zealand 15-1 (Munro 7, Seifert 3) Sam Billings is on the TV mic, England\u2019s wicketkeeper and vice-captain in this tour. Thrilled to see him back in business after a tough 2019 where he missed most of the season with a bad shoulder injury. He makes a handy diving stop down the legside, Tom Curran missing his mark for the first time so far today. Munro tucks into the next offering, finally middling a swipe, nailing the off-cutter over square leg for New Zealand\u2019s first boundary of the match. Curran bounces back with expert Ian Harvey back-of-the-hand slower ball. Short-form cricket might be about big bats most of the time, but the skills these fast bowlers now bring to the crease really is something to behold. 3rd over: New Zealand 7-1 (Munro 3, Seifert 1) The new man Seifert is off the mark first ball with a well-timed push to point. Munro is battling hard out there, his three runs coming from ten balls. Chopped on! The result of pressure built up by the Currans at both ends. A wonderful start from the visitors. 2nd over: New Zealand 4-0 (Guptill 1, Munro 2) Tom Curran is opening the bowling with his brother - isn\u2019t that nice? He\u2019s right on it too, Munro unable to get anything away. The southpaw is driving and flicking and charging but none of it works, an excellent maiden the result. Top pace and variety from the older Curran. From our man at the ground, Ali Martin, he confirms the new ICC regs mean that there will be no boundary countback in the event of a tie into the future. We\u2019ll Super Over and Super Over until we have ourselves a winner. RIP boundary countback - we hardly knew you. 1st over: New Zealand 4-0 (Guptill 1, Munro 2) Tidy start, Guptill beaten by a Curran delivery that shaped away nicely with his second ball. He\u2019s off strike via his thigh pad, Munro getting the first run from the bat to backward square, Guptill off the mark in the same direction. Munro has a big dip at the final ball but doesn\u2019t get much of it, hacking away to midwicket to keep the strike. Well bowled. Anthems for a T20I? Unorthodox. But if it means getting five renditions of God Defend New Zealand over the next week, I\u2019m all for it. I doubt we\u2019ll get them at the MCG tonight, mind you. I\u2019m actually reporting from the MCG at the moment. Yes, since OBOing the 2nd Australia v Sri Lanka T20 on Wednesday, I\u2019ve flown here. Bottle of wine, couple of rom coms, cry - I\u2019m good to go. THE PLAYERS ARE WALKING ONTO THE FIELD TO ZOMBIE NATION! Wonderful areas from the Cricket Ground DJ. Sam Curran has the ball in his hand, bowling the first over in T20I debut. PLAY! National anthems shortly. But first, a moment of silence to remember the 51 people murdered in Christchurch eight months ago in the mosque attacks. Today\u2019s ticket sales are being donated to a fund encouraging the participation of minorities in sport. \u201cWe are all beautifully the same and wonderfully different.\u201d Nicely done. \u201cGuptill is the one in this XI who will be hurting the most,\u201d suggests Abhijato Sensarma in an email to me. You can write me too. Or tweet. \u201cThose few missed inches in the last moments of the World Cup final must be playing on his mind. These things can become distractions (as Maxwell rightly said in an interview recently), but with enough clarity of thought they can motivate better than anything else too. Time to start regaining form and show the world his worth again? No better place to begin than here, and I don\u2019t see why he won\u2019t be up to the task!\u201d Having watched Marty G make bulk runs against Australia last year in this format, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to worry about. Hard to believe this is Sam Curran\u2019s debut. I\u2019m sure you all know plenty about him. Pat Brown, perhaps less so unless you\u2019ve been watching him dominate for Worcs in the Blast. He\u2019s earned this chance. Lewis Gregory too, probably in at number six, the finisher role Morgan has said he\u2019s looking for ahead of the T20 World Cup. \u201cHe looks about 11 years of age,\u201d David Lloyd, on TV, says of Brown. \u201cBut he has all the slower balls and can also bowl at 90mph too.\u201d Both captains agree the track is a belter. Different format, of course, but this is where Brendon McCullum slapped a 54-ball Test ton to finish his amazing international journey in 2016. Eoin Morgan said at the toss there is a short boundary one side. This should be fun. Debuts everywhere for England. Three of them to be precise: Lewis Gregory, Sam Curran and Pat Brown. This should be fun. New Zealand: Martin Guptill, Colin Munro, Tim Seifert (w), Ross Taylor, Colin de Grandhomme, Daryl Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, Scott Kuggeleijn, Tim Southee (c), Ish Sodhi, Lockie Ferguson England: Jonny Bairstow, Dawid Malan, James Vince, Eoin Morgan (c), Sam Billings (w), Sam Curran, Lewis Gregory, Tom Curran, Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, Pat Brown They are having a bowl. Teams in a tick. Take a look Ali Martin\u2019s preview from Christchurch, which went more in the direction of rugby than cricket. Understandbly! The clocks have changed, the weather is grim, the summer is gone. On the bright side: it means international cricket - and the OBO - coming to you at all hours through the course of the next month with England\u2019s men in New Zealand for five T20s and two Tests. The series opener is at Hagley Oval in Christchurch, one of the most beautiful grounds on the planet. Being a lovely little place in the middle of the parklands, there are no floodlights - thus the Friday afternoon timing; unusual in the shortest form of the game. Of course, the last time these teams met was the greatest finish in the history of the sport. This won\u2019t be that. It is, however, where the starters\u2019 pistol is being fired on the sides T20 World Cup campaigns, that major tournament to be held this time last year in Australia. Eoin Morgan won\u2019t have Ben Stokes or Jos Buttler at his disposal here, his two World Cup heroes having a breather, but there are young players everywhere looking to make their bow. More on those after the toss. The locals are also without their superstar, Kane Williamson, the armband instead with veteran quick Tim Southee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
