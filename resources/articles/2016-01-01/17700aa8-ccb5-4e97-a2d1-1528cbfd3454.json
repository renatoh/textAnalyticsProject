By that yardstick there was strikingly little to please the voters on parliament\u2019s first day back of the new year. In one part of the Westminster forest gathered the Conservatives, a party so enduringly divided against one another over Europe that rebel ministers will now be allowed to campaign against their own government in the EU referendum. In another part huddled Labour, so haplessly at odds with itself over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership that the party leader had to struggle all day to make a single shadow cabinet change that his colleagues did not block. For one party to mislay its instinct for self-preservation may be regarded as a passing misfortune. For both main parties to do the same suggests that a more fundamental process of fragmentation is at work in British party politics. Although both of these party cleavages may be very important in the long run, there can be no argument about which one matters more in the short term. Britain\u2019s place in the European Union is a fundamental national interest, whether in terms of the UK economy, the security of the nation or Britain\u2019s place in the world. It is not to be messed with, even though much is wrong with the EU. We should remain inside the union, whether or not the renegotiation on which the Conservative government is embarked produces the sought-for changes. Anything that threatens our EU membership is in one sense a risk to the national interest, even the referendum for which the country has nevertheless now voted. But the decision to let ministers campaign on either side is a risk too. Seen in that light, David Cameron\u2019s decision is another regrettable act of weak leadership on a vital interest. At one level, Mr Cameron recognises the importance of UK membership, as he made clear in his keynote Bloomberg speech in 2013 and his Chatham House speech last year. His meeting with Angela Merkel this week is set to re-emphasise the importance for both nations of UK membership. There will also, as the prime minister said in the Commons on Tuesday, be a clear government position in the referendum on where Britain\u2019s interest lies, presumably in favour of continued EU membership. Given the importance of the issue, and the prime minister\u2019s stance on it, there is something reckless aboutTuesday\u2019s decision to allow ministers to campaign on whichever side of the argument they choose. Yet there is another way of looking at the decision which cannot be dismissed. The public is weary of too many characterless on-message politicians. Independence of mind in politics is rightly highly valued. Most people understand that such decisions are complex and that reasonable politicians are likely to see them differently. Moreover, although parties have in reality to be coalitions, no one wants to see politicians forced to argue a case they do not believe in. There is also the important precedent of the 1975 referendum on EU membership, when the Labour government suspended collective cabinet responsibility over Harold Wilson\u2019s terms and lived to fight another day, after a fashion. And Britain has now had the experience of a coalition government, in which collective disciplines were looser, and which the nation also survived. For these reasons it is hard to argue that Mr Cameron\u2019s failure to carry his cabinet and his party is the political equivalent of the end of civilisation. It was in practice inevitable that Mr Cameron, being the kind of politician he is, leading the party he does, and having to cope with the press we have, would take the decision that he has. All the same, Britain\u2019s need to be part of Europe is not just a point of view but an enduring reality. There can be no two ways about the outcome of the EU referendum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
