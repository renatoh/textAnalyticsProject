However, the first priority, British defence and security sources said yesterday, was to gather sufficient intelligence to identify the terrorists, a task, they added, which could take time. The enormity of the horrific attacks made it essential for the response to be right, independent analysts cautioned. Britain is using the intelligence-gathering facilities of GCHQ and its listening post in Cyprus, as well as MI6 and MI5, to try to discover the culprits. They are facing a unique challenge. Even pro-western Arab countries were pointing out yesterday that given the time it took to plan the attacks, the network of Osama bin Laden - the Saudi-born millionaire living in Afghanistan accused of coordinating the attacks - is present in the US as well as elsewhere in the Middle East and other countries. \"We are entering unchartered territory,\" said Michael Clarke, director of the centre for defence studies at King's College, London, yesterday. He said the best course to follow would be to find the evidence and then demand that the perpetrators be handed over by those harbouring them to an international criminal court. But Professor Clarke conceded that was unlikely. Effective military action against Afghanistan would be extremely hazardous. The easiest, but not necessarily the most effective, action would be strikes by unmanned cruise missiles from US aircraft carriers. Two such carriers, the Carl Vinson and the Enterprise, are already in the Gulf and they could be joined in an attack by the British submarine, HMS Trafalgar, which is armed with cruise missiles and is now making its way to the Gulf for a major military exercise. Afghanistan could be reached by cruise missiles fired from the Gulf. They and other bombs could be dropped on either Afghanistan or Iraq by US B-52 aircraft based in the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia or at the US base at Fairford in the Cotswolds. More extensive military action such as close-quarter bombing and the use of ground troops, notably special forces - which, defence sources insist, form part of contingency plans now being drawn up - would, if directed at Afghanistan, need the cooperation of neighbouring countries. Russia would oblige, western defence sources say. Pakistan presents a more difficult problem. Pakistan's military dictator, General Pervez Musharraf, yesterday pledged his \"unstinted cooperation\" to the US but refused to specify whether he would allow a possible retaliatory raid on Afghanistan to take place from Pakistan. Sources said Pakistan's senior generals were still discussing how much assistance to give amid concern of a fundamentalist backlash from the thousands of Islamic militants inside the country. No formal request from the US had been received, they added. Gen Musharraf yesterday issued a strident statement condemning Tuesday's bomb attacks in New York and Washington. He described them as \"barbaric acts of terrorism\". Concerted international effort was now needed to fight this \"evil\", he added. \"Everybody would be very unhappy if without any justification Pakistani soil is to be used [by US troops]. This would be no ordinary protest,\" Qazi Hussain Ahmed, head of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's largest Islamic party, warned last night. During the last US cruise missile attack on Afghanistan three years ago Pakistan was not consulted, and afterwards lodged a formal protest. Gen Musharraf yesterday held a 40-minute meeting with the US's new ambassador to Pakistan, Wendy Chamberlain, for what officials said were \"frank and forthright\" talks. A Pakistani military delegation set off for Kandahar, the home of the Taliban's leader Mullah Omar, on Wednesday night. Pakistani diplomats have already urged Taliban officials in Kabul to come up with a \"goodwill gesture\". But they believe there is little chance that the Taliban will hand over Osama bin Laden, it is understood. Pakistan is one of only three countries that recognises the Taliban regime. Most analysts now believe that Pakistan's military rulers have little choice but to offer the US full assistance in the wake of Tuesday's attacks. \"These events have been forcing a rethink,\" Rifaat Hussain, head of defence and strategic studies at Islamabad's Quaid-I-Azam University said. \"The Pakistani leadership is realising the grave implications of guilt by association with the Taliban. They recognise now that Pakistan cannot afford to be put on the wrong side of history because of this,\" he added. \"The cost of not co-operating with the Americans would be absolutely horrendous.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
