The clubs' collision in the Premier League in mid-September saw Adebayor stamp down on a grounded Van Persie, raking his face, which left the Dutchman bloodied and eventually earned the Togo international a three\u2011match ban. The City striker, the subject of fierce abuse from the travelling support following his \u00a325m defection in the summer, then scored the hosts' third goal in a 4-2 success before sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate on his knees in front of his former club's fans. One steward required treatment as Arsenal supporters reacted furiously to that perceived provocation, and the player was subsequently given a suspended two-match ban and a \u00a325,000 fine by the Football Association for his inflammatory celebration. Van Persie issued a statement immediately after the match expressing how \"sad and disappointed\" he was at Adebayor's stamp, which he said was \"mindless and malicious\". \"He set out to hurt me,\" he said at the time. \"He has shown a real lack of class, to me and the fans.\" \u2022 Wenger: Van Persie is a mixture of Henry and Bergkamp \u2022 Stats centre: Catch up with all the latest standings \u2022 In pictures: the best of the north London derby \u2022 All today's stories on our breaking news wire The Carling Cup would normally see Wenger select a youthful second-string \u2013 a line-up consisting of youngsters and fringe first-team players defeated Liverpool in the competition last week \u2013 though Van Persie, upon being told of the draw, indicated an eagerness to feature in what has inevitably now become a mouth-watering fixture. \"What's the draw? Manchester City away?\" he asked on Saturday. \"Nice. I want to play that one. If the boss decides to let me play, I'm happy. I'd love to play. \"It will be a good game because City have a good side, and I think it's a real challenge for the youngsters. If we can find the right mix, like we did last time against Liverpool, and play like that then we have a big chance of winning. The team showed some quality [last week], and we fancy winning that competition.\" Last week Adebayor revisited the furore whipped up by his behaviour at Eastlands, tempering an admission that he regretted his stamp on Van Persie with an attempt to justify his sprint from one end to the other to celebrate his goal in front of the seething visiting support. \"I see Robin in the tunnel and I told him: 'I'm very sorry for what happened,'\" he told CNN International. \"He's like: 'Why, why you do that?' and I told him: 'Robin, I don't know, that does happen, I'm sorry.' And, at the time, he told me: 'OK it's fine.' \"For me it was a special game because you're playing against your former team and [I] was coming up against people who were like brothers. When I get to the tunnel and see my friends, I try to shake their hands, but they don't want to shake my hand and it was a shock: what is going on? I felt very hurt. \"After that, when I get on the pitch and when I hear some [Arsenal fans] singing insulting my dad, insulting my mum, I think, we can't take everything. We are only human beings and I think that is something that you cannot take. We all got our limit. You can insult me, you can judge me on the football pitch, that's normal. But don't touch my family, don't touch my parents, I love them more than everything on this earth.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
