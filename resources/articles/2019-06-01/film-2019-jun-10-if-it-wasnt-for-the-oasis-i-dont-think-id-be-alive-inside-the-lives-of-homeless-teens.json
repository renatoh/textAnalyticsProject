Directed by Ian Darling and Sascha Ettinger-Epstein, the film brought with it a notable political and social impact: it led to a live televised forum hosted by Tony Jones and sparked media coverage from major network stations, with the DVD distributed to every high school in Australia. Perhaps most significantly it caught the attention of federal parliament. \u201cIt felt like a really optimistic time,\u201d director Ettinger-Epstein says, recalling the Rudd government\u2019s commitment to halving homelessness by 2020, and the landmark white paper on youth homelessness, The Road Home. \u201cAt the time there was such a groundswell of goodwill towards the issue and we thought something really was going to happen. But once something else gets a bit of traction, [homelessness] gets bumped off the agenda. This was a crying shame.\u201d One year shy of 2020 and the statistics for those living without stable housing hasn\u2019t come close to halving. In fact, social inequality has only worsened, with the number of people experiencing homelessness jumping 14% to 116,000 between the Census years of 2011 and 2016. And youth homelessness has increased disproportionately, with approximately 40,000 people under 25 homeless every night. For Ettinger-Epstein and Darling, these bleak figures \u2013 and the lack of political action around the issue \u2013 was the catalyst for their follow-up documentary, Life After the Oasis. Once again putting faces to the statistics, the sequel presents a candid portrait of how its original teenage subjects have spent the past decade. The documentary returns to a few familiar faces \u2013 most no longer homeless, though one of them, Hayley (one of the most charismatic personalities of the first film), is found still living on the streets of Melbourne. The others have made steady recovery journeys: Darren, last seen battling mental health issues and a drug addiction, is now several months sober and living in his own unit; Emma has since split up with her partner, Trent, and is now raising her children as a single mum; Owen, one of the most troubled teenagers in the original film, is working with the Salvation Army and pursuing his passion for music; and Chris, who was abused by his father as a child, has reconnected with his estranged mother. Ettinger-Epstein says she was deeply moved by the strength of the participants. \u201cI was astounded that [some of them] came out the other side \u2026 and really happy that they are genuinely making a quality of life for themselves.\u201d Cutting between flashbacks and the present day, the sequel \u2013 which premieres this week at Sydney film festival \u2013 is less gritty and chaotic than its predecessor. Its mood echoes the more mellow, lucid reflections of its now-adult subjects as they contemplate how far they\u2019ve come, and revisit locations from the original film \u2013 including the Salvation Army\u2019s Sydney Oasis Youth Support Network, previously run by Major Paul and Captain Robbin Moulds. Nowadays the husband and wife team work with asylum seekers and refugees in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs \u2013 but for 13 years, they played an integral role in reshaping the lives of many children who entered the centre, offering a personal, empathetic approach alongside critical intervention support services. Darren calls Paul Moulds a \u201cfather figure\u201d, whose generosity and compassion went beyond his job title. \u201cHe took the time to get to know us and took time out of his own life. If it wasn\u2019t for the Oasis, I don\u2019t think I would be alive right now,\u201d he tells the Guardian. There is no single reason why these young people were once on the streets. The complexities of their backgrounds vary from childhood trauma and abuse to mental health issues to family violence and neglect. Chris describes the experience of watching the original documentary as \u201cnumbing\u201d, but thinks it helped him identify what he wanted to change in himself. \u201cI was quite surprised by the whole picture of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what actual [homelessness] was until watching that \u2026 [I didn\u2019t understand] what made me homeless. Because you can end up homeless from many things.\u201d He hopes his appearance in both documentaries will provide audiences with an illuminating and more empathetic attitude towards homeless youth. \u201cI wanted to show that I\u2019m a normal person. Everyone\u2019s got their own problems. I wanted to show that anyone could end up here \u2026 and that if you gave some of us a chance, some of us would do good in our lives.\u201d Ettinger-Epstein hopes the documentary will reignite public interest in the issue of youth homelessness. \u201cThe stories illustrated the failure of policy and where society was heading,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are hoping to make people care again, show people that over time change can happen and that their lives can go somewhere.\u201d \u2022 Life After the Oasis premieres at Sydney film festival on 13 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
