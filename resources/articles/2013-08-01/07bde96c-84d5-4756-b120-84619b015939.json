At the heart of Labour's August of angst is this: many in the party doubt their capacity to win a parliamentary majority at the next election. Mr Miliband himself has said that he must \"defy history\" to take Labour from opposition to majority government in a single leap, a feat no British political party has pulled off since before the Second World War. It is not just old stagers such as John Prescott and David Blunkett who worry. Many in the party contemplate an underwhelming poll lead and a leader with poor personal ratings and struggle to see how that can add up to a history-changing combination. Labour's consolation is that it is not alone in this crisis of confidence. Exactly the same fear runs down the spine of the Conservative party. People who know them well report that neither David Cameron nor George Osborne has any genuine confidence that they will succeed in 2015 where they failed in 2010. Shrewd Tories quietly think that the highest they can realistically aim for is to be the largest party in another hung parliament. We can't, of course, be sure that there will be a second one. Nor certain whether that outcome would definitely entail further coalition. A lot is contingent on the performance of the Lib Dems. If they can cling on to at least 40 MPs, it increases the chances that neither of the bigger parties will secure a majority and makes more likely power-sharing of either the Con-Lib or Lab-Lib variety. Below that sort of level of Lib Dem representation, Labour or the Tories might be more inclined to take office as a minority government and then try for a majority at another election a bit later. The Lib Dems might also be minded to go into opposition rather than coalition if they are left with too few MPs to have much clout within government. Those caveats duly entered, it makes sense for the parties to think about what they would do if the electorate again declines to give anyone a majority. To an extent, this scenario is already concentrating some minds. According to one senior figure who ought to know: \"Everyone is doing much more planning for it this time than they did last time.\" Labour insiders say that they won't be repeating Gordon Brown's 2010 mistake of not doing any advance contingency planning. Senior Tories are also thinking quite hard about it. I'm nevertheless sceptical that they have fully appreciated the extent to which this is a challenge to many of the traditional ways of doing British politics. One thing they will have to dispense with is the hoary old ritual of each party leader insisting that an unequivocal victory for him is both the essential outcome of an election and the only possible one. In the past, even Lib Dem leaders have taken this approach rather than be candid about the implications of a hung parliament. I can recall Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy and Nick Clegg all gamely protesting to incredulous interviewers that no one should write off their chances of being elected as prime minister at the head of a Lib Dem government. That will sound even more ludicrous at the next election. Rather than try to sustain a pretence that they could be a majority government, a better way \u2013 really, the only plausible pitch \u2013 for the Lib Dems will be to argue the merits of coalition. That will mean urging voters to make a hung parliament happen on the grounds that neither Labour nor the Tories can be trusted with power on their own and having Lib Dems in the cabinet ensures that Britain is governed from the centre. The blue and red tribes are never going to be cheerleaders for coalition. But they will have to rewrite their campaign scripts. During the 2010 election, David Cameron travelled the country issuing what he hoped were blood-freezing warnings that a hung parliament would be the most gruesome catastrophe to engulf Britain since the Black Death. Having presided over a coalition for five years, a coalition he will want to present as an overall success, he won't be able to beat the same drum in 2015. Ed Miliband will come under pressure to be much clearer than he is at the moment about what Labour would do in the event that the voters decline to reward anyone with a majority. Both will have to mind their language about the Lib Dems. The Tories and Labour can be \u2013 and, you bet, will be \u2013 as rude and personal as they like about each other because the outcome no one expects is a German-style \"grand coalition\" of left and right. But David Cameron and Ed Miliband will have to calibrate with care what they say about Nick Clegg as he will have to modulate the levels of abuse he issues in their direction. Mr Cameron can hardly slag off Mr Clegg as \"not fit for government\" when they will have spent five years sitting in the same cabinet. The Lib Dem leader cannot credibly condemn Mr Cameron as a completely useless prime minister when he has been his deputy for half a decade. During the early phase of this parliament, when the Labour party was often more vituperative about the Lib Dems than it was about the Tories, Ed Miliband used to say that he could \"never\" imagine himself being in coalition with Nick Clegg. You have not heard Mr Miliband repeat that for some time, another indicator that he is mentally preparing himself for the possibility that he might need to strike a Lab-Lib deal. The central thrust of Tory propaganda is the claim that Labour \"can never be trusted with the economy again\". The Lib Dems cannot say the same if they want to leave the door open to going into government with Labour. So their formulation will more likely be: \"Ed Miliband and Ed Balls cannot be trusted with the economy on their own.\" One of the more difficult dilemmas in an age of coalition politics is how you write a manifesto. Traditionally, the manifesto has been treated as a sort of sacred text: the solemn covenant of pledges that a party promises to deliver if the people confer it with power. We all know it frequently doesn't work out like that in practice. The conventional manifesto pledge was increasingly discredited before 2010 by the regularity with which single party governments broke them. Multi-party governments, formed as a result of coalition negotiations during which policies have to be traded, guarantee that some promises won't be delivered. Nick Clegg has been preoccupied by this problem, and the implications it has for policy-making and retaining the trust of voters, ever since he was burnt in effigy for busting his party's pledges on tuition fees. You will recall that his subsequent apology was not for betraying his word, but for making a foolish pledge in the first place. The Lib Dems, as the advocates of pluralist politics, have a particular duty to be clear that coalition means you won't deliver on every one of your promises. As the time approaches when the parties will start to draft policies for their manifestos, it is now something for all the leaders to ponder. One answer is for them to order their priorities clearly by publicly distinguishing between those policies on which they will never compromise and those they regard as desirable but potentially dispensable in the event that they find themselves in a negotiation with another party. This will be extremely tricky to get right. Have too many policies on which you say you'd never budge and you risk making it impossible to reach agreement with another party. \"I tell my colleagues we shouldn't talk about having red lines,\" says one Lib Dem. \"You could red line yourself out of government.\" On the other hand, a party with no red lines exposes itself to the charge that it will haggle away any of its principles to get its hands on power. I can see this being one of the bigger obstacles to a second term of blue-yellow coalition. The sort of Tory, and there are a lot of them, who thinks that David Cameron has made too many concessions to the Lib Dems would like to bind him down with red lines. Just one example will do. Many Tories would want the abolition of the Human Rights Act to be among their areas of no compromise. For most Lib Dems, keeping the Human Rights Act would be a deal-breaker. Conscious of the danger of talking themselves into a corner, I expect all three leaders will try to avoid being too dogmatic in order to leave themselves with some negotiating wriggle room. But it will be much harder for them than it was at the last election. After one experience of coalition government, and with a reasonable chance of the next election leading to another, the media are bound to heap great pressure on the parties to spell out which of their policies are non-negotiable and which are merely bargaining positions. It is likely that the question will be most aggressively focused on Nick Clegg, but it will have to be faced by Ed Miliband and David Cameron as well. They'd all be wise to start thinking about it now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
