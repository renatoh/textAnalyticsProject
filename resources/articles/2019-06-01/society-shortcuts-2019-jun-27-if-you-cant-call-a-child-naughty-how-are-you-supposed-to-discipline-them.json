Whenever your child misbehaved, you could simply smack them until they stopped, safe in the knowledge that any behavioural problems this caused wouldn\u2019t fully manifest until they had grown up and left home. But then society decided that smacking was bad, which led to the creation of the naughty step; a system of banishing your toddler to a period of terrifying isolation until they gained the capacity to fully comprehend the intricacies of socially acceptable behaviour. But now that is apparently out as well. A study of nursery workers by daynurseries.co.uk has determined that the overwhelming majority of childcare providers no longer use the naughty step as a tool of discipline, because of its \u201cnegative connotations\u201d. Furthermore, 95% of nursery workers reported that they weren\u2019t even allowed to call a child naughty any more. Crazy, isn\u2019t it? I thought we had all agreed that the best way to get a child to behave was to tar them as an outcast and deprive them of all human interaction until they realised that the universe is nothing but a cold and dispassionate vortex of random cruelty. But I don\u2019t make the rules. So, if naughty is out, how on earth do you control a badly behaved toddler? The answer, awful as it is, seems to be treat them with basic respect. Calling a child naughty, especially one that only has a fundamental grasp of language, is a pretty brutal thing to do. They are slapped with a label they know means bad, but they don\u2019t necessarily understand why what they did was wrong. It is much worse if this happens in a nursery scenario, because as soon as you label a child as naughty, their peers start to see them as one-dimensionally bad, which affects how they are treated, which in turn affects their future behaviour. Call a child naughty, and all you\u2019re doing is creating a naughty child. Which isn\u2019t to say that you can\u2019t use the word naughty. Kids do naughty things all the time. This morning, I went to the toilet and discovered that someone had submerged an entire toilet roll in the bowl. That was a naughty thing for my child to do, but it doesn\u2019t mean he is an inherently naughty person. So that is what we told him. The difference between \u201cThat was bad\u201d and \u201cYou are bad\u201d is immense. It is the difference between asking someone to behave and taking a hammer to their entire sense of self-worth. It is inconvenient, I know, to have to patiently explain things to a child while reminding them that they are loved, especially when you could just scream at them to go and sit on the stairs, but that is the world we live in now. Like I said, I don\u2019t make the rules."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
