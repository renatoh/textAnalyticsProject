The double Olympic 800m champion stepped up her attacks on the International Association of Athletics Federations after the court of arbitration for sport released its 163-page judgment explaining why it decided to rule against her in a landmark case last month. Semenya is appealing against Cas\u2019s decision, which requires athletes with differences in sexual development (DSD) to take hormone suppressants to lower their testosterone below five nmol/L if they want to compete internationally between 400m to a mile. And she made it quite clear that whatever happens she would never again take medication \u2013 something she was forced to do between 2010 and 2015. \u201cThe IAAF used me in the past as a human guinea pig to experiment with how the medication they required me to take would affect my testosterone levels,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though the hormonal drugs made me feel constantly sick, the IAAF now wants to enforce even stricter thresholds with unknown health consequences. \u201cI will not allow the IAAF to use me and my body again,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I am concerned that other female athletes will feel compelled to let the IAAF drug them and test the effectiveness and negative health effects of different hormonal drugs. This cannot be allowed to happen.\u201d Among the revelations in Cas\u2019s full report are that the IAAF did argue that Semenya \u2013 and other athletes with similar DSD conditions \u2013 should be regarded as \u201cbiological males\u201d, which contradicts what the IAAF told the Guardian in February. The full report also reveals that Semenya told the judges that testosterone-suppressing medication in the past had affected her mental and physical health, and in addition to the feeling of sickness she endured, \u201csuffered from regular fevers and had constant internal abdominal pain\u201d. However, Cas also explains in more detail why it ruled in favour of the IAAF. It accepted that high testosterone in female athletes confers significant advantages in size, strength and power from puberty onwards and therefore ruled the policy was \u201cnecessary, reasonable and proportionate\u201d to ensure fair competition in women\u2019s sport. In its decision it also said that 46 XY 5-ARD (5-alpha-reductase deficiency) athletes \u2013 such as Semenya \u2013 have \u201ccirculating testosterone at the level of the male 46 XY population and not at the level of the female 46 XX population. This gives 46 XY 5-ARD athletes a significant sporting advantage over 46 XX female athletes.\u201d The IAAF said it welcomed the publication of the report. \u201cHaving the arguments of all parties in the public domain will help to foster greater understanding of this complex issue,\u201d it added. \u201cSport is one of only a few, narrow sectors of society in which biology has to trump gender identity to ensure fairness.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
