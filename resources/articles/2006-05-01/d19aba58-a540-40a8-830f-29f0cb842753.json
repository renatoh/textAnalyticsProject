It doesn't come around too often, so take a good look. Ken Loach's Palme d'Or triumph for his Irish civil war drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley was sensational - or at any rate, sensationally unexpected. Pundits had been backing Pedro Almod\u00f3var for his soapy melodrama Volver or Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Babel, a grandiloquent essay on global pain. Those two big players were rewarded respectively with best screenplay and best director. But Loach jinked through the middle to score the winning goal, and today he's entitled to thumb his nose at critics who damned his movie with faint praise. Was Loach a compromise choice? Or a \"lifetime achievement\" award for a Cannes favourite who has been in the running for the big prize on seven previous occasions? Such speculation is by the way, and perhaps churlish. Loach has made a fine and powerful film, trenchantly acted by Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delaney as two brothers who join an IRA guerrilla unit in 1920, but find themselves on opposite sides of the civil war that followed the signing of the treaty in 1922. It is furthermore a film which subtly asks its audience to consider how the treaty-ite spirit persists in 21st century geopolitics, and how an imperial possession can be prevailed upon to collaborate in its own subservience. However much Loach deserves this recognition, this was a subdued ending to a slightly subdued festival. Neither Almod\u00f3var nor I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had produced his very best work. The American Richard Kelly's interminable sci-fi fantasy spectacular Southland Tales was one of the most embarrassing films ever to be shown at Cannes. This was a quietly satisfying outcome for Loach, however, who in an age of irony and infotainment has toughly pursued an unfashionably political, engaged cinema."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
