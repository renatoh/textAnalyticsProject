In 2017 Florida-based APR Energy became the first company to attempt to sue the Australian government under the Australia-US free trade agreement, demanding $344m in compensation for Australia\u2019s treatment of its gas turbines. The action was made possible by deeply controversial provisions contained in many trade deals \u2013 known as investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS \u2013 that allow foreign corporations to sue a government for actions or policies that hurt them commercially. Such provisions allowed the tobacco giant Philip Morris to sue the Australian government over its plain-packaging laws under a Hong Kong-Australia investment treaty. Australia won the case but was left with a total $39m bill, including for the ISDS case and related proceedings in the high court and World Trade Organization. The APR Energy case \u2013 the first and only such case under the US-Australia trade deal \u2013 alleged that Australia had expropriated two gas turbines in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara region. The company said it was invested in the turbines and demanded compensation. \u201cIn this case, the compensation necessary to wipe out the consequences of Australia\u2019s conduct is not less than US$260,000,000,\u201d APR Energy said in a letter to the Australian government, according to the Australian newspaper. APR Energy issued Australia with a notice of arbitration in 2017. But Guardian Australia can reveal the case has gone nowhere, and that the Australian government now regards it as over. \u201cDespite serving the Notice of Arbitration, APR Energy did very little to progress the claim,\u201d a spokesman for the Attorney General\u2019s Department said. \u201cThe Department has taken steps to clarify the status of this matter and no longer considers the proceedings to be on foot.\u201d APR Energy declined to comment, saying: \u201cAPR Energy\u2019s policy is to not comment on legal matters.\u201d Despite the case\u2019s relatively short and uneventful journey, taxpayers have still been charged tens of thousands of dollars to defend it. Documents obtained by the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick show the total legal bill to Australia was $44,000. The bill is small but Patrick says it is further evidence that ISDS provisions leave Australia vulnerable. \u201cThese are the dangers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe matters have been discontinued but it has cost the taxpayer. Last time it was $39m, this time it was $44,000. Who knows what it will be next time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
