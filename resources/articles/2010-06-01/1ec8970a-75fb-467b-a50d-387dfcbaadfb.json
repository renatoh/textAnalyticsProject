But at the end of it, as Graeme Swann belted Clint McKay over mid-off for six to bring things to the most emphatic conclusion, England had beaten Australia by four wickets for the second time in two days, this time with 28 deliveries in hand. Asked to make 240 to win, they lost a frenetic Craig Kieswetter early on to Bollinger before Andrew Strauss, who hit a brace of sixes in his 51, and Kevin Pietersen, batting with massive assurance for 33, added 68 for the second wicket. Both fell within three overs of one another, Pietersen to a brilliant leaping one-handed catch by Ricky Ponting at mid-wicket that belied his age but not his eyesight or coordination. By then, though, they were so far ahead of the required rate that Morgan and Collingwood could consolidate and simply keep the score ticking along. It was not the most scintillating cricket but utterly pragmatic and the crowd, being largely Welsh, sang along happily enough. In any case there was a job to be done and before Collingwood dragged Bollinger on to his wicket and Morgan edged a lifter to the keeper their fourth-wicket stand of 83 had knocked the top from it. The teams now move on to Old Trafford for the third match of five with England having equalled their most successful run of one-day victories and Collingwood overtaking Alec Stewart as England's highest limited-overs run maker. Three straight wins over a side that beat them 6-1 last time they met would be the stuff of dreams but such is the confidence in the England camp and so poor is the injury-hit Australian bowling, weakened further by a groin strain to Ryan Harris, that they must be considered favourites to achieve it. There is no reason to change the side for that game but one more win would wrap up the series and present an opportunity to try other faces in the squad, such as the returning Ian Bell, who is said to be batting superbly, and Ajmal Shahzad. Earlier, having won the toss, Australia came bursting from the blocks against Jimmy Anderson, with Shane Watson brutally powerful on the drive as the bowler sought early swing. The advent of Stuart Broad, celebrating his 24th birthday, changed the complexion of the innings as first he broke the opening partnership of 51 and then dismissed Ponting and Michael Clarke before adding the wicket of Steve Smith towards the end to finish with 4 for 44, fiery stuff on a pitch that had some pace and bounce to exploit and sufficient to be man of the match. The rest of the bowlers settled down and responded as crucially Watson, when well set, lost the strike for all but four balls of the second five-over power play and then slogged Luke Wright vertically. Only Cameron White, who made an excellent and well-judged unbeaten 86, and Smith, more robust for his 41, moved Australia towards a total that was competitive, their sixth-wicket stand worth 84. No passage of play will have pleased Andy Flower more than that which brought about the downfall of Clarke, whose 87 at the Rose Bowl on Tuesday had seemed to indicate a return to form. Broad had tried the bouncer and Clarke's response had been an uncontrolled hook in the air to fine-leg. Strauss brought in Swann to hover at short-leg, a brave decision, and three balls later another bouncer took his glove and lobbed in the air. Any juice in the pitch in future and he might find half-volleys in short supply. The development of White as a one-day cricketer represents one of the few bonuses for Australia. This is a shark in the waters of the Australian batting. A Great White, of course, a middle-order predator. He lurks. He is dangerous. On Saturday, in their warm-up game against Middlesex, he gave an indication of his skill with a century. Yesterday this ubiquitous limited-overs batsman, capable of the most destructive power hitting but possessing an almost gentle deftness as a contrast, showed both sides in facing 98 balls, with seven boundaries and two sixes \u2013 one a cudgel from Swann and the second a baseball home-run over long-on as Anderson sent down a low full toss."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
