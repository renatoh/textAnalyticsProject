In an interview with Sinclair TV, Trump said Sessions had not been \u201cmentally qualified\u201d to be his first attorney general. Now running for his old Senate seat in Alabama, Sessions continues to doggedly protest that only he could properly implement the president\u2019s agenda. The undignified exchange began on Friday night. Still sore over Sessions\u2019 recusal from the Russia investigation in early 2017, and having recorded the Sinclair interview at the White House earlier that day, Trump told voters not to trust his former ally. Sessions objected but insisted, loyally, that he was the right pick for Trump supporters. Then on Saturday Trump hit back harder, saying Sessions \u201cruined many lives\u201d and appearing to equate his former aide with the \u201cdirty cops\u201d of the Russia investigation, whom the president referred to as \u201cslime\u201d. Sessions recused himself from the investigation into Russian election interference after failing to inform Congress of contacts with the Russian ambassador during the election campaign. His deputy, Rod Rosenstein, appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel after Trump fired James Comey, the director of the FBI who had overseen the investigation since its beginnings under Barack Obama. After a near-two-year investigation, Mueller did not find a conspiracy between Trump and Russia but did lay out links with Moscow and possible instances of obstruction of justice by the president, whom he did not exonerate. \u201cMr President,\u201d Sessions began a Saturday tweet. \u201cAlabama can and does trust me, as do conservatives across the country. Perhaps you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d The message did not calm Trump, who spent his White House evening firing off abuse and retweeting messages in questionable taste about Sessions, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Stacey Abrams, Hillary Clinton and others. \u201cThey trusted me,\u201d Sessions went on, \u201cwhen I stepped out and put that trust on the line for you. You and I fight for the same agenda. Tommy Tuberville [his Senate opponent, ahead in the polls, endorsed by Trump] is so weak he won\u2019t debate me and too weak for Alabama. \u201cAlabama will vote for you this fall, but Alabama will not take orders from Washington on who to send to the Senate.\u201d The message was in keeping with Sessions\u2019 campaign tactic of maintaining extreme loyalty to the man who regularly humiliated him in office and, after the 2018 midterm elections, fired him. He succeeded only in poking the bear. \u201cJeff,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cyou had your chance and you blew it. Recused yourself \u2026 and ran for the hills. You had no courage, and ruined many lives. The dirty cops, and others, got caught by better and stronger people than you. Hopefully this slime will pay a big price. \u201cYou should drop out of the race and pray that super liberal Doug Jones \u2026 gets beaten badly. He voted for impeachment based on \u201cZERO\u201d. Disgraced Alabama. Coach Tuberville will be a GREAT Senator!\u201d Tuberville, who once coached the Auburn Tigers, a college football power, will face Sessions in a run-off in July. Jones won Sessions\u2019 old seat in December 2017, beating a hugely controversial Republican, Roy Moore. The Democrat faces an uphill battle to keep the seat in November. Doggedly, Sessions still wasn\u2019t done. \u201cI will never apologize for following the law and serving faithfully and with honor,\u201d said the immigration hardliner who was once denied a federal judgeship over accusations of racism, who was the first senator to endorse Trump and who mentored Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s far-right White House adviser. \u201cNeither of us knew about the phony investigation into our campaign until after I was sworn in. As you will recall, I recommended firing James Comey from the very beginning.\u201d That was Saturday night. Sunday morning brought cold comfort. \u201cJeff Sessions was a disaster as attorney general,\u201d the president told the syndicated Full Measure show, in a rambling complaint about the Russia investigation. \u201cShould have never been attorney general, was not qualified. He\u2019s not mentally qualified to be attorney general. He was the biggest problem.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
