Depp is in hot water with the Department of Agriculture after failing to declare his two Yorkshire terriers when he flew into Australia on his private jet last month for the filming of the fifth instalment of the Pirates of the Caribbean movie franchise. \u201cHe has decided to bring to our nation two dogs without actually getting proper certification and the proper permits required. Basically, it looks like he snuck them in,\u201d agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce told reporters on Thursday. \u201cWe found out he snuck them in because we saw him taking them to a poodle groomer.\u201d The penalties for breaching Australia\u2019s biosecurity laws are severe, according to the agriculture minister. \u201cMr Depp has to either take his dogs back to California or we are going to have to euthanise them. He\u2019s now got about 50 hours left to remove the dogs.\u201d Australia\u2019s strict biosecurity measures are in place in order to keep out canine diseases such as the bacterial infection leptospirosis and rabies. The agriculture minister said no one should be able to bypass biosecurity rules, even if they had been voted the world\u2019s sexiest man twice. \u201cIt\u2019s time that Pistol and Boo buggered off back to the United States,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cHe [Depp] can put them on the same chartered jet he flew out on to fly them back out of our nation.\u201d Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said Joyce was making Boo and Pistol \u201cwalk the plank\u201d. \u201cHow was the breach of our border security allowed to occur in the first place?,\u201d he asked. \u201cInstead of grandstanding before the media, Barnaby Joyce should be answering the hard questions about the breach and what role his biosecurity funding cuts may have played.\u201d The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, admitted there had been an error somewhere in the customs process in letting the dogs in. \u201cThey should be screened like everyone else,\u201d Dutton told 2GB radio on Thursday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re having a look at this at the moment.\u201d Speaking earlier to ABC local radio in Brisbane, Joyce said keeping diseases such as rabies out of Australia was no trivial matter. \u201cThe reason you can walk through a park in Brisbane and not sort of have in the back of your mind \u2013 what happens if a rabid dog comes out and bites me or bites my kid \u2013 is because we\u2019ve kept that disease out. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how close it is, it\u2019s in Bali, it\u2019s just next door, so this is not fanciful stuff and therefore we\u2019re very diligent about what comes into our nation.\u201d Within hours, Depp\u2019s Gold Coast residence was surrounded by media waiting for a sight of the dogs. An online petition calling on the minister to save the dogs was signed by more than 600 people in its first hour. The author of the petition, 27-year old Sydney woman Namita Sopal, told Guardian Australia she hoped it would start an online movement to put pressure on the government to withdraw its \u201ccruel\u201d threat. \u201cI love dogs and I thought it was crazy, so that was my motivation,\u201d she said. The United States embassy in Canberra released a statement warning citizens of Australia\u2019s strict customs and quarantine regulations and advising potential travellers with specific concerns to contact the Australian embassy in Washington DC for more details. Lianne Kent, the owner of Happy Dogz, the grooming service where Depp and his wife Amber Heard had taken Pistol and Boo at the weekend, posted on the business\u2019s Facebook page that it had been \u201can honour\u201d to attend to the pets. \u201cTheir hair was really long and they needed a trim. She [the celebrities\u2019 handler] desperately wanted them trimmed back and their faces styled,\u201d she told the Gold Coast Bulletin. \u201cThey wanted the dogs groomed somewhere that\u2019s a bit more private and we\u2019re right near the set anyway.\u201d Kent did not return Guardian Australia\u2019s calls. Joyce acknowledged that his tough stance on the issue would come with consequences. \u201cAfter that, I don\u2019t expect to be invited to the opening of Pirates of the Caribbean,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, animal welfare groups called on the environment minister, Greg Hunt, to deny film-makers permits for two capuchin monkeys who were due to perform in the new Depp movie, which is in production on the Gold Coast. The activists said importing the animals from the US to Australia would cause them significant physical and psychological distress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
