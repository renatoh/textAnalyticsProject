Disturbingly, the BNP bandwagon has crossed the Pennines, moving from Lancashire to west Yorkshire. The party now holds the former Labour ward of Mixenden - a predominately white working-class area outside Halifax, which suffers some of the worst poverty in the country according to the government's indexes of deprivation. So why has the BNP had such a run of electoral success, even if it is only in low turnout council elections, and how worried should we be about it? The obvious but nonetheless valid explanation is the rise in racial prejudice fostered by the Sun and the Mail's campaign against \"bogus\" - and now terrorist - asylum seekers. The home secretary, David Blunkett, was entirely right to ask the tabloids not to exacerbate \"fears and concerns [that] can so easily turn to a desire to find scapegoats\". But our political parties are also partly responsible for the rise of the racist right. In the last parliament the Tories used the sensitive issue of asylum to try to shore up their core vote. So far the shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, has resisted pressure from colleagues to adopt William Hague's old policy of promising to lock up all asylum seekers although he hasn't ruled it out altogether - he told Guardian Unlimited this week he would prefer a \"less draconian solution\". The Conservatives' decline has also contributed to the BNP rise in another way. Repeatedly, a collapsing Tory vote has allowed in the BNP across the north of England. The first ballot box opened at the count last night was from the predominantly middle class, \"white flight\" village of Mount Tabor; scores of BNP votes poured out. Labour is also partly responsible. The problem of constantly trying to appeal to the prosperous floating voter is that many of Labour's traditional supporters feel left out. Of course, Labour cannot abandon the C2s, that path leads back to the political wilderness of the 1980s, but it needs to strike a careful balance in terms of its appeal. No 10 seems to know that, hence the prime minister's speech last night, in which he argued that the government's reform programme is the only way to achieve greater equality. But old as well as New Labour is also to blame. In many of its northern strongholds, the party is run by local councillors whose idea of a campaign headquarters is wherever the whisky bottle is. They make little effort to sell their achievements to an electorate they take for granted, and even less to build party membership. For instance, the ward party membership in Mixenden is just 17. Labour staffers can come in and work extremely hard to get the Labour vote out during difficult elections, as they did in Burnley and Mixenden, but local party members need to be out campaigning all year round. On the matter of whether last night's BNP victory really matters, the answer is a definite yes. Though a BNP councillor can make little difference on how a council is run, they make a big impact on the community they represent. Not only are the minibus-loads of BNP activists terrifying for anyone who is not white - 150 were out campaigning yesterday in Mixenden - the party's victory means a heightening of racial tension and sharp rise in racist attacks for years to come. One of the difficulties mainstream parties face is that, when canvassed, people refuse to admit they intend to vote BNP - in other words they are still ashamed. Perhaps something positive can be taken from this: most of the party's supporters are not irredeemable. If only the Tories could reverse their national decline and Labour could sort itself out locally, it should not prove impossible to return the BNP to obscurity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
