So if you're not especially sure of your haggling skills, or you always seem to be the only one who pays the sellers first price while everyone else pays half, then ease yourself into it. If you're shopping in a market, stroll around first, take a look at what's on offer, see what might interest you. And at the same time, advises Tom Hall of Lonely Planet: \"Look at what the locals are doing.\" Take a few lessons in haggling from people shopping in the market, watch how they bargain, try to see (without being too overtly nosy) what sort of prices they are paying for items, get a feel for the place. If you see something you like, then ask the trader or shopkeeper for his or her price. However, Gwyn Topham, editor of Guardian Unlimited Travel, says: \"Only ask the price if you are seriously interested in buying. If you're not, then asking might be considered impolite.\" Whatever the trader asks for may well be at least twice the price you could pay for it, and sometimes far more. \"The price the trader will accept is almost always far lower than you'd expect,\" says Gwyn. Whatever the trader says, be friendly and polite and come back with a far lower price, and look like you mean it. The chances are they will look outraged. Keep smiling, this game of price ping-pong will probably go on for some time. If you reach the point where they really won't budge and you really want to buy the item then give in gracefully. There's little worse than seeing an overheated tourist getting worked up over 50p. After all, this is a pleasant afternoon on holiday for you, but it's a full time job for them. If you want the item but you're sure they could drop a bit still get a fair price, you can always try the walk away game. Seasoned backpacker Robin Johnson, from London, says: \"Let them start very high, you start ridiculously low - with a smile on your face, always treat it as fun - then keep swapping prices until you've started sticking and they're only lowering a bit, if any. Then if you feel they're holding out too high, just walk away. You'll nearly always get called back with a price matching what you were offering, or nearer to the true value at least.\" Get into the habit of thinking in the local currency when bargaining, and don't switch from, say, Moroccan dirham to pounds mid haggle. And always assume the trader is more on the ball than you, this is their territory and they almost certainly are. No-one likes to feel they're being swindled, but for the sake of a relaxing trip, it might help to resign yourself to the fact that in most cases you won't be paying the same prices as the locals. After all, the chances are you're not earning local wages either. Of course, in many destinations you won't just be haggling over souvenirs, you may also have to argue over the price of getting around. Taxi drivers the world over have a bad reputation for giving their fares the runaround, but there are ways to make sure you get a trip at a decent price. If you arrive at the airport, tired and disoriented, then you will be fair game for any taxi drivers on the make, and in some destinations there will be plenty. However, in a lot of popular tourist destinations where the problem has become serious, the authorities have taken action. At Bangkok airport, for example, there may be a welcoming party of unofficial drivers touting for business, but if you make it through you will find a booth where they should allocate you a driver with a working metre. \"Always ask the driver to turn the metre on, and where possible use an officially licensed taxi,\" says Tom Hall. You will need to be equally alert once you get away from the arrivals lounge. Robin Johnson says: \"Make sure you make yourself clear, especially with numbers. We got a bemo [a small pick up truck with seats in the back] in Indonesia. \"We agreed a price of 17,000 rupiah [about \u00a31] or something. At the end of the journey we found out, or at least the driver claimed, we had agreed 70,000 rupiah [about \u00a34.10]. It was probably a rip-off on his part, but possibly just a genuine mistake from us,\" says Robin. With hindsight, Robin advises: \"Try to learn at least the basic numbers in the local language to help you verify prices beforehand, and use hand gestures and hold up fingers to count if necessary.\" Lonely Planet's Tom Hall adds: \"If in doubt, ask them to write down the price to make sure you both understand.\" Of course, agreeing a price in the first place is not always easy. \"As an obvious tourist, you are going to get ripped off,\" says Penny Rance, who is another experienced traveller. \"But there are certain measures you can take to minimise this.\" Back to Bangkok, where it's common to hire a tuk tuk, a small motorised rickshaw, to get around town. \"The initial price quoted for any journey will be anything from three to five times what the driver is actually prepared to accept,\" says Penny. \"It also depends on your apparent level of desperation. The height of the water in monsoon season, and the prevalence of any other mode of transport will directly affect how much they think they can get out of you.\" \"Look nonchalant, point out that you have previously been taken much further for less, and that you have no doubt there'll be someone along in just a minute who'll be happy to ferry you for less. Stick to your guns, and you'll get a better price. And your feet will stay dry,\" she says. Once you get used to haggling over souvenirs or journeys, however alien it may feel at first, it gets easier. As Tom Hall says: \"It's part of the holiday, so enjoy it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
