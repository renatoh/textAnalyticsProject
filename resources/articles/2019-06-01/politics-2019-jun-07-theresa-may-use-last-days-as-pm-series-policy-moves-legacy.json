The prime minister is keen to salvage some semblance of a domestic legacy from her three-year stint in No 10, which has been overwhelmingly dominated by Brexit. May\u2019s spokesperson said on Friday: \u201cYou heard from the PM recently in setting out that for the remainder of her time in office she will be focused on delivering and building on the domestic agenda that she has put at the heart of her premiership, since she became prime minister.\u201d May has already responded warmly to the Augur review of higher education funding, suggesting that maintenance grants should be restored. However, Whitehall sources suggest No 10 has clashed with the Treasury about making costly pledges. Philip Hammond has repeatedly made clear that with a full-blown spending review coming up in the autumn, decisions should be made in the round. Giving evidence to the Treasury select committee in April, Hammond was asked about whether extra resources could be found for key priorities before the spending review kicked off. \u201cIt would be possible, but I do not think it would be a good idea at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe point of a periodic spending review is an opportunity for government, parliament and society more widely to debate priorities, to look at how we allocate scarce resources across the vast range of potential avenues for spending those resources, and to decide what our priorities are for the next period and how we want to allocate resources.\u201d However, that approach did not apply to the \u00a320bn of extra funding for the NHS May announced last year. Hammond is also nervous about the idea that some of the \u00a327bn of \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d he set aside for Brexit contingencies could be spent, despite the fact that none of the frontrunners for the Tory leadership have ruled out no deal. Asked whether May had clashed with the chancellor, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cThey meet regularly to discuss spending priorities. I wouldn\u2019t get into the nature of the discussions.\u201d A Downing Street source played down the idea that any announcements would amount to a spending splurge, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll want to keep delivering for people, but what we haven\u2019t said is whether/how much that costs.\u201d No 10 slapped down the chancellor on Thursday, after the Financial Times revealed a leaked letter in which he had said May\u2019s promise to hit net zero carbon emissions by 2050 would cost \u00a31tn in lost economic output. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m not getting into the contents of the letter, but broadly there are a lot of figures out there on this issue that don\u2019t factor in the benefits or consider the costs of not doing this,\u201d said the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson. Hammond and May have had a rocky relationship. During the 2017 general election campaign, she pointedly declined to say whether he would continue as chancellor, while he was standing alongside her. The chancellor once suggested \u201cfiscal\u201d, when asked to choose one word to describe himself. But he has repeatedly irritated colleagues by reining in their plans. One cabinet minister described his reticence about May\u2019s final announcements as: \u201cEeyore strikes again. He just likes to shoot everything down.\u201d May will resign formally as Tory leader on Friday: a move that will be cemented by a private exchange of letters with the chairs of the backbench 1922 Committee. However, she will remain in place until her successor is chosen, a process due to be completed in the week beginning 22 July. All the leading contenders for the premiership have made high-profile spending pledges. Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock have focused on education, while Jeremy Hunt has suggested the UK needs to spend more on defence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
