The infection may have been a factor in his defeat by Sir Des Champs, the second-favourite for the Gold Cup, in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Leopardstown on Saturday. Peter Casey, Flemenstar's trainer, said on Monday night that the Melling Chase at Liverpool's Grand National meeting in April is now his most likely target. \"He'll be out for two to three weeks,\" Casey said. \"It's a bad lung infection. The vets found he had it today. \"He's going to be all right in the long term but I would say Cheltenham is very unlikely now. The jockey [Andrew Lynch] thought something was wrong on Saturday and it looks as if he was right. We'll probably look at Aintree now.\" Flemenstar was the leading novice chaser in Ireland last season but missed the Cheltenham Festival as he had not been entered for any of the races. The hope was that he would be a more mature steeplechaser at the 2013 Festival but Casey's long-term planning now seems to have been in vain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
