Age 7+ In Shirley Hughes's A Brush with the Past, food-related tableaux depict the first half of the 20th century. A relaxed tea in the sunshine of an English country garden in 1914 is followed by a scene showing mugs of tea being drunk in the trenches. In 1950, a cheerful group of young white Americans enjoy ice-cream sundaes, while on the other side of the street a poor black family look on longingly. Alternating spreads laid out to suggest pages from a catalogue, each covering a two-year period, are filled with snippets of social and political information, around the author's conversational account of life at the time. There is much to reflect on, not least the pervading sense that, despite social and political upheavals, people themselves remain unchanged: a seaside picnic is as much fun, a soup kitchen as wretched, today as it was in the 1920s. This is a fascinating book for children and adults.
