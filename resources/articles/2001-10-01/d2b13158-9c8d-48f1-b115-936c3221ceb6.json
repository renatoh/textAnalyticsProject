He counts the leading lights of Britain's glittering set among his friends. This week Jonathan Yeo, son of the Shadow Cabinet member, Tim, will be welcomed on to the A-list of fame when the first official portrait of the Prime Minister is unveiled. Yeo, one of the band of ultra-fashionable young British artists, painted it. The question now is whether the guest of honour will be there. Although William Hague, the former Tory leader, and Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats - whom Yeo has also painted - have agreed to appear at the official unveiling ceremony at Westminster on Wednesday, Tony Blair has yet to confirm whether he will be there. 'He is an oddly shy man and was worried that having a portrait done would somehow appear self-indulgent,' Yeo said. 'If he doesn't make it we've asked Cherie to come along and she knows his face even better than he does.' A friend of the Prime Minister said it was likely that the man who is at present prosecuting a war in Afghanistan would find the whole process 'acutely embarrassing'. Even Yeo, 30, admits that seeing portraits in which the sitter's head appear more than twice lifesize can be a 'little unnerving'. Blair agreed to the portrait through Tony Banks, the Labour MP who is chairman of the House of Commons Advisory Committee on Works of Art. Banks told him that it was a tradition stretching back to Robert Walpole for Prime Ministers to have their portraits painted. Blair reluctantly agreed to Yeo accompanying him during the election campaign. Yeo was given remarkable access to Blair, travelling on his private election bus and accompanying him in his jet back to London on the night of the election. Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of communications, got so used to having Yeo around he even got undressed in front of him after a trip to the gym. 'Alastair would sit around making jokes about what I was doing,' Yeo said. 'He said things like \"Call that a real job?\", and generally made out that he found the whole thing faintly ludicrous.' But Downing Street's infamous 'gate-keepers' - the staff who keep prying eyes away from the Prime Minister - made sure it was as difficult as possible for Yeo to do his job. 'They were very suspicious of me,' Yeo said, particularly given that his father was at the time berating the Government over its handling of the foot-and-mouth crisis. 'I was sitting in on private meetings so that I could sketch the Prime Minister and they had never met me before.' After a number of frustrating days, Yeo finally had to call in the services of his friend Ross Kemp, the actor, whom he has also painted. 'Ross introduced me to the Prime Minister at an event in Norwich and he immediately made a joke and that seemed to break the ice,' Yeo said. He hopes his portraits reveal much about the personalities of the sitters. 'Blair has a slightly manic energy and has that Clinton knack that when he is speaking to you, you feel you are the most important person he has ever met,' Yeo said. 'But then five seconds later you see he is doing exactly the same to the next person and you feel let down.' Banks doubts that the Commons will be getting Yeo to do any more official portraits. 'To tell you the truth we couldn't afford him again,' the Labour MP said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
