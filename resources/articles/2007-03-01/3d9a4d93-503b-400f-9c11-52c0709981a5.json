Personalities clashed through the mix of generations and musical attitudes - but for 16 months, it randomly slammed together the 1950s jazz world of swing/bop symmetries and the 1960s one of free-jazz rule-breaking. Scott's preferences for richly voiced horn parts, ballroom-clinch slow music, Blue Note soul-bop groovers and Latin jazz are clear in tracks such as Kenny Wheeler's Second Question and Joe Henderson's Recorda Me. But a young John Surman, with the slippery cymbal beat of the great Tony Oxley behind him, is in a different world on the riffy blues of King Pete. Kenny Wheeler's trumpet sound is exquisite on Lord of the Reedy River, while soulfully funky altoist Ray Warleigh contrasts Scott's shapely swing-tenor lines. The two-drummer lineup of Oxley and the much straighter Kenny Clare creates explosive, if eventually self-destructive, excitement. This live set is more than a history lesson - it's a hit-and-miss experiment that turned into a great UK jazz record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
