The government's Highways Agency is offering \u00a31.6bn to a private consortium to widen around 60 miles of the M25 to four lanes in each direction. It will take five years to build, will swallow tens of thousands of acres of greenbelt land, encourage yet more people to travel by car - and it will end up costing the taxpayer more than \u00a35bn. But the widening of the M25 in Kent, Surrey, Hertfordshire and Essex is just one of 150 privately or publicly funded road schemes that have now been quietly approved or are already under construction. That is more than four times the number of major schemes on the books than when Labour came to power nine years ago. In what critics are describing as the biggest U-turn since Tony Blair came to power, ministers have abandoned their post-1997 election commitment to cut back on new roads, and are presiding over a massive expansion of the motorway and trunk-road network . It all looked so different back in 1997, when environmental campaigners had every reason to feel optimistic, having won the argument that new roads were environmentally destructive, did not solve congestion, and encouraged traffic. Then, the Conservatives had been forced to retreat from what had been heralded by Margaret Thatcher as the \"biggest road-building programme since the Romans\". When New Labour took over, it cut back further what was left of the Tories' road plans, and a 1998 transport white paper promised to look at more sustainable alternatives. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, famously declared: \"I will have failed if, in five years' time, there are not many more people using public transport and far fewer journeys by car.\" The idea of reducing demand for roads was in line with academic studies which conclusively showed that building more roads encouraged motorists to drive further and allowed more cars on the roads. But Labour's priorities have gradually changed. Prescott was not given the money he wanted for public transport, and after the fuel protests of 2000 and accusations that Labour was \"anti-motorist\" the government abandoned its commitment to annual rises in fuel tax. Rebecca Lush, a former Twyford Down protester who now runs the campaign group Roadblock, says Labour has been cunning. \"The Tories made announcements about new road-building plans with a great fanfare,\" she says. \"Labour saw how they were forced into retreat as new roads became more and more unpopular, so ministers have kept making green-sounding noises and talking about how building more roads is not the answer. But ... that's exactly what they're doing - building lots and lots of roads.\" The detail is damning. By 1998, Labour had cut the remaining major road schemes inherited from the Tories from 150 to 37, and studies were launched to look at improved rail or bus services as possible alternatives to roads. But 22 out of 23 \"multimodal\" studies recommended road-building. The key change came in 1999 when the new transport minister, Lord MacDonald, announced that the latest priority was to reduce traffic congestion - rather than seeking to reduce traffic volume and encourage alternative means of transport. In other words, forecast traffic increases would be catered for by building more roads. In July 2000, a 10-year transport plan set aside \u00a359bn for new roads and promised widening of 360 miles of motorways and trunk roads, and 130 other major road improvement schemes. Four years later, the 2004 Future of Transport white paper concluded that, before 2025, a further 2,500 miles of road carriageway needed to be built, and that another \u00a35.3bn would be needed for local roads. Meanwhile, the Department for Transport has been routinely giving the go-ahead for major new developments. In 2003, it approved the first stage of ambitious plans to widen 60 miles of the M1 between Luton and Sheffield, at a cost of \u00a33.7bn. In 2004, the green light was given to widen the M1 and 63 miles of the M25. In total, \u00a312bn has been committed for road schemes across the country. And, despite strong local opposition, ministers this year ordered the Highways Agency to prepare plans for the widening of the M6 between Birmingham and Manchester for another \u00a32.9bn. There are no headline-grabbing new roads being pushed through open countryside on the scale of the M3 extension through Twyford Down in the 1990s, but numerous proposed roads will be environmentally destructive. These include the Weymouth relief road, which threatens nature reserves and protected countryside in Dorset; a new bypass through the Peak District national park; and the proposed M4 relief road, which would plough through the Gwent Levels marshes, south of Newport. To help speed up the process, the Highways Agency's annual road-building budget for 2006-07 has been increased to \u00a31.046bn - almost double the previous year's budget. The extra money has been found by siphoning off funds allocated for traffic calming and new technology to ease congestion. This is against the advice of the National Audit Office, which recommended in November 2004 that the emphasis should be on making the best use of existing infrastructure and improving technology. The Commons transport select committee has also criticised the burgeoning cost of new roads. Its latest report, in July, calculated that cost overruns could be more than \u00a31bn and concluded that the Highways Agency \"had lost budgetary control\". According to a recent parliamentary answer, the average cost of building a mile of new motorway has risen to \u00a329.9m. Adding an extra lane to a motorway costs \u00a310m a mile, and a mile of dual carriageway costs \u00a316.2m. A study by Roadblock shows that, on average, motorways and trunk-road schemes end up costing 68% more than originally budgeted - a cost overrun being investigated by the National Audit Office. According to transport analysts, creating more road space will inevitably lead to more traffic, which will result in more greenhouse gas emissions. Road transport already accounts for a fifth of Britain's CO2 emissions, and the government's own forecasts are for a 40% increase in road traffic over the next 20 years. While greenhouse gas emissions from industry and commerce have been falling, annual CO2 emissions from road transport increased by 10% between 2000 and 2004. The government's Climate Change Programme Review accepts that road traffic growth will result in a further 19m tonnes of CO2 pollution this decade. The Stern report on the costs of climate change estimates that every tonne of carbon emitted can be costed at \u00a350. A recent study commissioned by an alliance of environmental groups concluded that the Department for Transport does not have a clear picture of the effects of its policies on climate change, with no data on CO2 emissions for more than half of the road-building schemes approved for motorways and trunk roads. Stephen Joseph, director of the pressure group Transport 2000, says that while money seems to be found when roads come in over budget, transport schemes such as the proposed light rail networks for Leeds, Liverpool and south Hampshire have been cancelled on the grounds of cost. \"There is no real pressure to look at alternatives to new roads, and the thinking at the Department for Transport is that road building is the natural order of things,\" he says. \"There is a failure to think that the world could be different.\" Countries such as Holland, Joseph says, have shown that high-density development can be planned around rail and bus links and cycle routes to reduce dependence on cars and improve the urban environment. \"That kind of approach is completely missing [in the UK],\" he says. \"The pattern we are still seeing in all the growth areas is low-density development around roads ... All the house-building and development around Stansted airport in Essex is built around roads that ultimately will produce more traffic and more pollution. It is entirely unsustainable commercially, economically and environmentally.\" Keith Buchan, director of the Metropolitan Transport Research Unit, says Britain has wasted 10 years. \"By the late 90s there was a political consensus that the 'predict and provide' approach to road building did not work, yet this has been forgotten,\" he says. \"We have built lots of houses, industry and warehousing in new areas and we wonder why we have got all this traffic. If you get the location policy right, you remove the need for local traffic, which clogs up the roads and drives everyone crazy. In the past few years, we've had this huge increase in the need for travel and what we need to do is reduce that.\" A Department for Transport spokesperson says some \"targeted\" road building is necessary to tackle congestion and improve road safety - but it is also essential to get more out of existing capacity. \"The government is determined that transport should play its part in tackling CO2 emissions. We are making unprecedented investment in public transport - spending \u00a32bn a year supporting buses, \u00a388m a week on the railways, and \u00a31.6bn a year on local transport.\" Last week, a government-commissioned report by the former British Airways chief Sir Rod Eddington called for the introduction of road tolls on busy routes across the country as a way of cutting congestion. But any such system is unlikely to be in place for at least 10 years, and he argued that more roads can be good for the economy. Road building looks set to go to on.
