Marvel is having a moment. From the minute details in the world-building to the complexity of the characters and the scale of the stories, there are few things more exciting than a really brilliant comic book. If you have an idea or concept for your own comic, but aren\u2019t sure how to break into a seemingly closed industry, this masterclass with Marvel\u2019s Kieron Gillen is for you. The writer of a huge range of comics - including the critically acclaimed The Wicked + The Divine, and Marvel Comics\u2019 Young Avengers - Kieron will give you the advice he wishes he had heard at the start of his career. Combining anecdotes, practical takeaways and a breaking down of individual stories and pages (plus Q&amp;A), Kieron will take you through how to construct your jump-off point into a strong story, how the industry works - and doesn\u2019t work, how to maintain your unique voice and style in a process that might involve more opinions than you\u2019re used to - and more. This is a unique opportunity to hear from one of the leading comic book writers in the world. If you\u2019re in the early stages of crafting your own comic, you\u2019re trying to get yours to land in a difficult industry, or if you simply have a story to tell, this is an unmissable chance to have your questions answered, and - more importantly - be on your way to realising your comic writing dream. Please note: the location of this masterclass has changed. It will now be held at Amnesty International. Course content What a comic script is, what it isn\u2019t and how to make yours yours without making an artist want to kill you. How the industry works and doesn\u2019t work. Demystification and warnings. The whole Process - building your idea, your team and the book to show the world. How do you work with artists, editors, inkers, colourists and everyone else. What works? What\u2019s ethical? What\u2019s both? Narrative structure, at every level - the panel, the page, the issue, the series. Q&amp;A Tutor profile Kieron Gillen is a British comic book writer. He is known for co-creating the acclaimed comics The Wicked + The Divine, DIE and Phonogram. He has also worked on numerous projects for Marvel Comics, including Uncanny X-Men, Darth Vader, Young Avengers, Iron Man and Star Wars.
