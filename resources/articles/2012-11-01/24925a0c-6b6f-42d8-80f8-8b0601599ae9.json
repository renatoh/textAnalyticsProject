Polls generally give Romney the edge in Florida but surveys are conflicting and both parties say turnout will decide the result. Judging by the past week of early voting, supporters of the two candidates appear to be fired up, although without much of the optimism that drove Obama's 2008 campaign. About 4.4 million Floridians \u2013 more than one third of registered voters in the state \u2013 cast their ballots early, a substantial increase on four years ago. But long queues, with some people waiting more than seven hours to vote, and the curtailing of early voting by the Republican-controlled state legislature in circumstances that appear to make it more difficult to cast ballots in areas where the Democrats are strong, have already prompted a lawsuit. The Florida Democratic party's legal action is unlikely to go anywhere in the hours before the election but it is a marker that the result will be open to dispute if a Romney victory in Florida delivers him into the White House. The allegation that the Republicans are effectively trying to disenfranchise opponents is helping to drive some Democrats to the polls. \"The Republicans think we are stupid,\" said Lucia Wilson waiting to vote in Tampa on the last day of early voting on Saturday. \"They think we can't see what's happening before our eyes. They don't want Democrats to vote. They don't want black people to vote. They're doing everything they can to hand it to Romney. That's why I'm here for early voting. So I can be sure to vote.\" Turnout has also been bolstered by a stream of political heavyweights descending on the state to urge people to vote. None is bigger than Bill Clinton. \"We love Clinton. He's fabulous,\" said Michelle Butler, a business manager, waiting to see him speak. \"Now he's out of office, he can say things the president can't say like Romney's full of shit. Obama has to keep up the political integrity of the office. Clinton can go out there and call Romney on all his crap.\" Across the street, a Romney supporter held a one word sign: \"Obamanation\". \"These people made a huge mistake in electing him,\" said a man who would only give his name as Jerry. \"They should admit their mistake and put a real American in the White House.\" A real American? \"Someone who puts America first. Not someone who's trying to destroy America.\" Jerry declined to elaborate. But for some Obama supporters, it is a largely unknown Romney that is driving them to the polls. \"Fear is not too strong a word,\" said Claire Fitzgerald, a store manager in line to vote. \"It's not what Romney has said he will do that worries me. It's that he's shifted positions so often he could do anything. We don't really know what he stands for. Who's he listening to? Maybe the wrong people who will take us into another war. Plus, he wants to kill Obamacare [health care reforms]. That's reason enough to vote against him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
