Yes, you may be able to log on to the net al fresco in your garden, but when your neighbour's doing the same it's time to worry. The more forgiving may be inclined to overlook this ... until their internet connection starts running at a snail's pace owing to someone \"piggybacking\" on their Wi-Fi, and thereby using up bandwidth. And that's before someone's hacked into all the sensitive documents on their network. To protect yourself, change your network's name or SSID. This is set by your router box, and usually defaults to the manufacturer's name. How you change your SSID varies between different models (check the manual), but it will involve dialling into the router from an attached web browser to bring up the set-up screen. You can also configure it to be invisible to other Wi-Fi users, so that unless you know the network's new name you won't be able to log on. Next, scramble the wireless connections so only users with the authorisation key can hook up to the network. Activating the Wired Equivalency Privacy (WEP) on the set-up screen will encrypt communication between devices, generating a number of keys to choose from to act as your passcode. Finally, make sure that you note the new settings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
