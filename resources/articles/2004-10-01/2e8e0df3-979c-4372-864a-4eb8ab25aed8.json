Newcastle, who were among the top seeds, face Sporting Lisbon, Dinamo Tbilisi from Georgia, Sochaux from Montb\u00e9liard and the Athenian team Panionios. For Middlesbrough the task is tougher, with their opponents including Lazio, Villarreal of Spain and the Serbian league leaders Partizan Belgrade. Middlesbrough's match with Lazio at the Riverside will see Gaizka Mendieta come up against his former club, who also include a familiar adversary in the shape of Paolo Di Canio. \"The draw is excellent for our fans,\" said the Middlesbrough chief executive Keith Lamb. \"We have a good relationship with Lazio because we signed Gaizka Mendieta from them last season and I'm sure Mendi will be looking forward to it and showing them what he's made of.\" Mendieta will not, however, get the chance to return to the Stadio Olimpico. The revamped format of the Uefa Cup means that teams play the other four clubs in their group only once, with two matches at home and two away. The top three clubs in each of the eight groups will then advance to the last 32, where they are joined by the eight third-placed clubs from the Champions League, as the competition reverts to a two-legged knock-out format. As well as the visit of Lazio, Middlesbrough will face Partizan Belgrade, who denied Newcastle a place in the group stages of the Champions League last season, on Teesside. Steve McClaren's side will expect to return from their trip to the Greek minnows Egaleo with maximum points, but Villarreal will represent a much more difficult proposition. The Spanish club, who are likely to feature the former Manchester United striker Diego Forlan in attack, accounted for Celtic on their way to last season's semi-finals. Middlesbrough's north-east rivals Newcastle face Sporting Lisbon and Dinamo Tbilisi at St James' Park and, with trips to Montb\u00e9liard and Athens, Freddie Shepherd is already confident of progressing. \"I'm very pleased with that,\" said Newcastle's chairman. \"It's a fair spread, so the supporters will be happy - they're good travellers.\" Newcastle will also have history on their side, having overcome Sporting Lisbon on the way to winning the Fairs Cup - this competition's predecessor - in 1969. However, Hugo Viana, who joined the Portuguese club on a season-long loan in the summer, will not be allowed to face his former team-mates. Newcastle, with a touch of foresight, stipulated that the midfielder would be ineligible if the two clubs met. Rangers will be thankful that they face their toughest opponents - Auxerre of France and Grazer AK of Austria - at Ibrox Park. The Scottish Premierleague runners-up travel to Amica Wronki of Poland and the Dutch side AZ Alkmaar in their other matches. Hearts have the most testing group of the four British clubs. Craig Levein's team face the former Uefa Cup winners Schalke 04 and Millwall's conquerors Ferencvaros at Murrayfield, and they travel to Switzerland and the Netherlands to take on Christian Gross's Basle and Ruud Gullit's Feyenoord respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
