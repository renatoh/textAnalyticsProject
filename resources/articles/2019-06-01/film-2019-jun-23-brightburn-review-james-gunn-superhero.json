This is fine as a starting point, but it becomes increasingly unsatisfying as the film struggles to articulate why Brandon is evil (though its end credits are soundtracked by Billie Elish\u2019s hit single Bad Guy to ensure the point is hammered home). There\u2019s plenty of time spent on the violent hows (I\u2019m still shuddering, thinking about a Tarantino-esque scene involving a shard of glass and a woman\u2019s eyeball), but a lack of conviction in its own mythology. As an antihero with an oedipal complex, neither Brandon nor Dunn is sufficiently creepy or conflicted to launch a new franchise. Brandon can\u2019t compete with Batman\u2019s nihilism, Deadpool\u2019s self-deprecation or Wolverine\u2019s depressed lone wolf quality. Produced by James Gunn of Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy films, Brightburn is eager to explore something darker than the comic-book genre usually permits. The handheld cinematography emphasises its grittier, more horror-inclined ambitions, recalling the camerawork in Josh Trank\u2019s found-footage superhero thriller Chronicle. Yet in its attempts to provide an antidote to the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s catalogue of liberal fantasies, the film swings too far in the other direction (even the town\u2019s name, Brightburn, recalls far-right news website Breitbart)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
