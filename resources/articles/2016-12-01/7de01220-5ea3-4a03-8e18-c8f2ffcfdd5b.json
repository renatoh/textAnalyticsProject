Martin Bain, the club\u2019s chief executive, recently acknowledged that the manager would have \u201cvery limited\u201d funds during next month\u2019s transfer window as Ellis Short, the owner, attempts to reduce a \u00a3140m debt while keeping his \u00a373m wage bill within Premier League remuneration cap rules. \u201cManaging Sunderland always had an appeal to me but, if I\u2019d known about the financial situation, I\u2019d have needed to look at it in a different way,\u201d conceded Moyes, whose bottom-placed team are at home to Watford on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019d have had to have thought a lot more about taking the job. I didn\u2019t see us having no money in January. I\u2019m disappointed I won\u2019t be able to do some work in January and build on what we\u2019ve done so far.\u201d When Moyes succeeded Sam Allardyce, he remained unaware Short was willing to sell Sunderland in the near future. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger challenge than I thought because of the situation the club are in and the situation I\u2019ve been put in,\u201d said the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger job than I expected. I didn\u2019t know the club could be going up for sale. I wasn\u2019t made aware of it before. \u201cThat would probably be what I\u2019d say is the difficulty. I knew what we were spending in the summer was small in comparison to other clubs \u2013 and I said that to the owner but I didn\u2019t see us having no money now. I hoped we\u2019d get things done in January but that has shown itself not to be the case. But I\u2019m going to move on. I\u2019ve dealt with it in my head and we\u2019re getting on with it.\u201d Moyes\u2019s downbeat comments make quite a contrast to his optimistic message to Sunderland\u2019s website on taking charge five months ago. \u201cMartin Bain and Ellis have been terrific,\u201d he enthused at the time. \u201cThey\u2019ve given me some guarantees and reassurances about what we can do because we\u2019ve got a big club here that we need to take forward. Celebrating staying up can\u2019t be the goal. I\u2019ve been really impressed by the owner and his guarantees to make sure that we keep improving.\u201d What particularly puzzles the Scot now is that Short had seemed so delighted to finally recruit him after four failed previous attempts. \u201cI find that difficult,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cWhen I joined I was saying I\u2019ve come here to improve the club. I don\u2019t want to be here and us be a team at the bottom. This club has the infrastructure, the stadium, incredible support, some of the biggest crowds in Europe. That\u2019s the appeal of Sunderland. And I knew the owner had wanted me for a long time.\u201d Many managers in similar positions would be strongly tempted to quit but Moyes has resolved to battle on. \u201cI\u2019ve not been tempted to walk because I\u2019ve seen some steel from the players, a belief in what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe players didn\u2019t know anything about the club\u2019s situation either and we need to give them a lift. There have been some shoots of improvement but now we need to get in a huddle and stick together.\u201d It does not help that an already injury-ravaged squad has now lost Jan Kirchhoff, a key midfielder, for some months with a serious knee injury but Moyes remains inspired by Bain\u2019s unstinting support. \u201cI\u2019ve a lot of respect for the chief executive, who was big and brave enough to say it how it is to the supporters and everyone here,\u201d he said. He hopes to repay such honesty by creating something of a siege mentality. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some serious injuries and we\u2019re very short, particularly in central midfield, but we have to say: \u2018Let\u2019s pull together and give 100%,\u2019\u201d Moyes said. \u201cPatch yourself up whether you\u2019re injured or not and get out.Sometimes that can galvanise you.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s frustration and disappointment but I\u2019m going to stand up, stick my chest out and get on with it. I\u2019m going to fight and I expect everyone else at the club to do the same.\u201d Even so, there is recognition that, in the current context, survival would be comparable to winning a trophy. \u201cStaying up would be a good achievement,\u201d he said, with considerable understatement. \u201cOther managers have done it here but my task might be slightly harder.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
