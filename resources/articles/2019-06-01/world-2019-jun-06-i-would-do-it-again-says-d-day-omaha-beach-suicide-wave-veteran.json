Pickett\u2019s highly-trained company suffered a 96% casualty rate during the first hour on Omaha, the fiercest and costliest strip of beach landed during Operation Overlord, the world\u2019s largest amphibious operation which would eventually pave a bloody way to the liberation of Europe. The US air force\u2019s bombing campaign had, unknown to the supreme allied commander General Dwight Eisenhower, failed to knock out the German defences ahead of the landing. This left the 29th division to emerge from the sea into untrammelled machine gun and artillery fire which turned the sand red and the sea into a gruesome soup of body parts. Two thirds of Private first class Pickett\u2019s company were to die within a week of the landing on 6 June 1944. \u201cIt is difficult to explain how I feel about today,\u201d Pickett told the Guardian once Trump\u2019s Marine One had flown off and the TV cameras and military top brass had long gone from the cemetery\u2019s 70 hectares (172 acres) of landscaped lawns overlooking Omaha beach close to the village of Colleville-sur-Mer. The night before the commemorative event where Pickett was to be garlanded by Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron, the veteran, who had no idea of what was planned, had spoken of his hopes that the business of the day would keep his mind busy. \u201cBut, yeah, I had the flashbacks. I saw things today,\u201d said Pickett, one of 16 veterans brought to Normandy by the Best Defense Foundation. \u201cIt was when I could see the beach from the cemetery. I could see my landing craft being hit as we got to the beach. But I have learned to live with it.\u201d Pickett was Company A\u2019s flamethrower, a job he had been transferred to after witnessing a comrade being blown in half by TNT during his training in the demolition unit. \u201cI wanted out of that. \u2018You can be the flamethrower then,\u2019 they said.\u201d His job at 6.30am on 6 June 1944 was to land on the beach, crawl through a gap made by the wire-cutters and run across the 300 metres of fine sand to knock out a German pillbox containing machine gunners. His boat was in the lead in the assault on the beach. But as Pickett\u2019s landing craft came up to shore at the right time and in the right place, it hit something, possibly a mine or an artillery shell. \u201cIt just knocked me coo-coo,\u201d said Pickett. The young soldier awoke sometime later in shallow water unable to move. \u201cAbout 12 to 15 feet to my right up in front there was a dead man and I couldn\u2019t see his face and I don\u2019t know who it was. And I couldn\u2019t pull myself over there to see because my elbows were just digging into the sand.\u201d \u201cI saw a lot \u2013 too much,\u201d Pickett said. \u201cA lieutenant on another boat, a big lieutenant, he had been a football player, we thought the world of him, Lt Fergusson. Well, I saw him running down the beach screaming and hollering: \u2018I can\u2019t see, I can\u2019t see.\u2019 His whole forehead was down over his face. You couldn\u2019t see his face. He didn\u2019t run far when another guy hollered at him to stop, and told him to turn directly to the left, off the beach. He did, he ran a few yards, and he was shot down.\u201d Pickett let the tide take him away from the beach where a landing craft was able to pick him up to be returned to England. \u201cI kept on feeling my back for blood but there was nothing. Perhaps I was so terrified that my back and legs seized. \u201cBy the time I got back to England I could hop around. They offered for me to go to hospital but they were saying how much they needed us back there. Another guy and I went back. Limping really. I was back with the company in six days.\u201d Pickett joined a unit seeking to liberate Saint-L\u00f4. He was hit by grenade shrapnel in his left arm and sent back to England for 21 days \u2013 before rejoining the front again during the battle for the French port of Brest, where he was in a foxhole when an enemy shell collapsed a wall on top of him and left him on the edge of the death. Pickett said he had been tormented over being unable to clear out the German machine gunners\u2019 post on D-day. \u201cI get gripey with myself on that. I go over it a lot in my mind. How many could have been saved? But then did I want to be the person to use the flamethrower? There were five men in there.\u201d Pickett\u2019s nights and days have ever since been tortured by visions of what he saw. \u201cBut if it came to it \u2013 and I was involved \u2013 I would do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought my country was worth it then and I still do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
