At a circular fence of waist-high thorny bushes, she knocks on the metal sheet serving as a makeshift door. A woman\u2019s face, partially hidden by a bright green hijab, appears. \u201cSalaam Alaikum,\u201d Abdulle says, \u201cpeace be upon you.\u201d Holding up a hand to the armed guards tasked with accompanying the visiting charity staff following her around the displacement camp, she instructs them to stay outside. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to scare her,\u201d she says. Abdulle, 48, was living in the desert town of Oog in northern Somalia in 2016 when drought turned the region to dust, driving thousands of families from their homes. Now she makes daily visits to one of three sprawling displacement camps outside the town to campaign for vulnerable women and girls. Once a climate refugee herself, she knows what their lives are like. \u201cI tell them to gather in groups when they go out,\u201d Abdulle says. \u201cThat most of the men are your enemies, so don\u2019t go out alone so you can be safe from the violence and the rape, especially at night-time.\u201d In Somalia, climate change is driving rape, sexual violence and intimate partner violence. Droughts linked to climate change ravage the landscape with increasing frequency, hurting families who depend on farming and herding animals. The spike in regional violence against women and girls takes two forms: domestic violence against women who have become family breadwinners , and sexual violence against women and girls who have migrated to camps near crowded urban centres. Abdulle came from a pastoralist family, displaced by drought and conflict during Somalia\u2019s civil war in the 80s. After a nomadic life with her family, Abdulle was sent to the capital city, Mogadishu, for her education. She returned first to her parents in northern Somalia, and then moved to Oog. \u201cWhen my family [lived] in the countryside, we had a drought like this one [in 2016],\u201d Abdulle says. \u201cThe people were helped. Some were educated, some worked and some of them went abroad. I know something about the droughts. When the droughts come, there can be good change for the people, especially for women.\u201d In 2016, when waves of displaced pastoralist families streamed into Oog, looking for healthcare, food, water and shelter, Abdulle felt compelled to document the crisis and to protect and empower women and girls. She recorded videos to send to the government and the Somali diaspora, requesting support for the overwhelming need. Abdulle\u2019s no-nonsense attitude and unrelenting commitment encouraged the community to approach the local government to request she be put in charge of their welfare. Holding a paid leadership position overseeing men is an usual responsibility for a woman in Somalia\u2019s male-dominated society. \u201cThe surprising thing is that the three male heads of the three IDP camps are \u2026 happy that Ibado is above them,\u201d said Muna Hussein, a gender officer at Oxfam, who works closely with Abdulle. \u201cThey listen to her.\u201d Camp conditions are hazardous for women: there is no lighting at night, and no doors or fences to keep out opportunistic criminals and predators. As drought continued in 2017 and 2018, the population in Oog\u2019s camps boomed. And crimes against women and girls mounted. While updated statistics are hard to come by, at least 25% of Somali women have experienced gender-based violence exacerbated by conflict and displacement due to the climate emergency, World Bank data shows. Much of this violence happens in displaced communities. Research from Oxfam suggests women in Somalia are most at risk when walking to collect water and firewood, using outdoor toilets and sleeping in makeshift huts that lack doors and lighting. The perpetrators come from both inside and outside the camps. The government, fragile and under-resourced, cannot provide protection and services to the nearly 2.6 million Somalis already displaced. Abdulle has sought to help local women and girls protect themselves by organising groups to collect water and firewood. She has also coordinated forums, groups of volunteers who meet to learn how to campaign for their needs and rights. She also acts as a counsellor and friend for women who have been attacked. \u201cIf a girl who was raped came to me, I would start by speaking with her,\u201d Abdulle says. \u201cThen, I would take her to the hospital for any treatment. And I would take her to the nearest police station immediately to arrest the perpetrator of this crime.\u201d In the blazing afternoon sun, with strong winds kicking up fierce dust storms, the makeshift tents in the displacement camp look identical: round huts propped up by sticks and covered in a patchwork of faded, old cloth. But Abdulle knows the women living in each one and navigates between the huts with ease. Sukhra Idris, her name changed to protect her privacy, lives alone in this camp with her two children. When Abdulle enters, she greets her with a hug. The lines around her eyes make Idris look older than her 23 years. She was married at 17 to a man from a wealthy family. \u201cI met a boy and fell in love and felt I was ready for marriage,\u201d Idris says, pulling up the bright green hijab as her young child tugs from her head. \u201cI was in a hurry for that because I was very young.\u201d When the 2016 drought hit, the couple\u2019s livestock transportation business was ruined. . According to experts, men unable to provide for their families often become more prone to domestic violence. Idris says her husband began to abuse her, slamming her against a wall, punching and slapping her. \u201cI told him to do his own work because we didn\u2019t have enough to eat and needed to support old people like my mom and dad,\u201d said Idris. \u201cAt that time, he was beating me if I asked him to bring milk for his kids.\u201d Idris tried several times to leave, but social stigma pressed her to return. It was only with Abdulle\u2019s support that Idris was able to leave for good. She struggles to survive with her children in the displacement camp and one has died from diarrhoea. After a long day, Abdulle visits Oog\u2019s only hotel to sit beneath the shade of a tree and sip a cup of camel milk tea. With climate change intensifying and droughts increasing in the region, Abdulle knows she alone cannot meet the overwhelming needs of all Somali women and girls. Her greatest hope is that the displaced women she is helping to train and empower will pick up the fight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
