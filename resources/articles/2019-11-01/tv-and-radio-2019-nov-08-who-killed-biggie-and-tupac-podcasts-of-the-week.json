The company\u2019s pod-focused strategy, including publishing excerpts from the shows online, saw the most recent run of its hit series Slow Burn attract 300,000 downloads in just 24 hours. Another huge pod success story this week is The Missing Cryptoqueen, the eight-part BBC Sounds tale of a multi-billion-dollar cryptocurrency scam which reached No 1 on the iTunes chart following its final episode. The Guardian spoke with its creators this week. Picks of the week Hunted (out 12 Nov) Parker Posey is deputy marshal Emily Barnes, the woman investigating a breakout from a maximum-security prison, in this new scripted podcast masterminded by Law &amp; Order\u2019s Dick Wolf. Four men have escaped, killing a guard in the process, and so begins a dangerous manhunt. One minute Barnes is briefing her team, the next she is juggling her childcare options. By the end of the first episode, the bodycount is already rising and the script is tight, allowing the fast-moving plot to grip listeners. Hannah Verdier Have You Heard George\u2019s Podcast? The winner of five British Podcast awards, spoken-word performer and writer George the Poet returns for a second series of experimental, stereotype-busting, immersive audio shows. In the first episode, he considers in verse how mainly white audiences are used to mining black artists\u2019 trauma as if it were \u201ca fossil fuel\u201d, before taking a look at a test case via Reaganomics, rap and blaxploitation. Music from Grandmaster Flash, Bobby Womack and \u201cSabrina\u2019s Boy\u201d help to tie it all together. Hannah J Davies Guardian pick: Tough start for the Tories \u2013 Politics Weekly If you\u2019re looking to make sense of the forthcoming general election, the Guardian\u2019s daily podcast, Today in Focus, will have election coverage every day between now and 12 December, as well as continuing to cover a range of politics-free subjects. Meanwhile, Politics Weekly will provide nuanced discussion and analysis throughout the lead-up to the election, with commentators from different political persuasions. This week, political editor Heather Stewart is joined by the deputy political editor of the Spectator, Katy Balls, the Britain editor of the New Statesman, Anoosh Chakelian, and Jon Mellon, co-director of the British Election Study. Plus, political correspondent Peter Walker is at the launch of the Brexit party\u2019s campaign. Listener pick: Odd Ball Chosen by Katherine Godfrey, head of audio \u201cSomehow word got out, there\u2019s a weird ball in town.\u201d Ancient aliens, Navy investigations and a Florida mansion all play a role in the story of a strange, vibrating ball that silenced a family. This is a quirky addition to the investigative genre, based on the mysterious arrival in 1974 of a metal sphere that, witnesses say, rolled around on its own. As host Lindsay Kilbride tells us in episode one, this is about much more than just a \u2018weird ball\u2019 \u2013 it seems to have captivated anyone that came into contact with it and, ultimately, taken over the lives of the Betz family."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
