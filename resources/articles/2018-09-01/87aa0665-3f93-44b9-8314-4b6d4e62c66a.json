A roadmap being published on Tuesday by the government\u2019s waste reduction body, Wrap, and the food and grocery charity IGD sets a series of milestones for businesses to reduce waste at every stage of the supply chain. The annual bill is equivalent to more than \u00a3300 per UK citizen. The voluntary scheme aims to ensure the UK meets the UN\u2019s sustainable development target (specifically target 12.3) of halving per capita global food waste at retail and consumer level and through production and supply chains by 2030. The UN estimates global food waste causes about $940bn (\u00a3770bn) a year in economic losses. It says a third of the world\u2019s food is wasted while one in nine people remain malnourished. By September 2019, the roadmap aims to have all major UK retailers and half of other large producers and suppliers measuring, reporting and acting on food waste. By 2026, all large food businesses should have a target to cut waste from their operations. Supermarkets have been criticised for contributing to the UK\u2019s food waste mountain by sticking rigidly to quality specifications and routinely rejecting mis-shapen, but edible, produce grown by suppliers. They have also been urged to do more to redistribute edible items to the needy via food banks and charities. Eighty-nine early signatories, including the UK\u2019s biggest supermarkets as well as food producers, manufacturers and restaurant chains, have committed to the plan. They include Britain\u2019s largest retailer, Tesco, which will announce on Tuesday that 27 of its biggest suppliers, as well as Booker, which Tesco merged with this year, will publish data on food waste for the first time. Ten of Tesco\u2019s branded suppliers including Coca-Cola, Mars, Nestl\u00e9 and Unilever will also commit to the project within the next 12 months. Addressing a New York event organised by Champions 12.3, a coalition of governments, businesses and international organisations committed to accelerating progress toward the 12.3 goal, its chair, the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, will say: \u201cEvery year, a third of the world\u2019s food goes to waste \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of 1.3bn tonnes of food being thrown away \u2013 and we think that\u2019s simply not right. We believe that what gets measured gets managed.\u201d Tesco became the first UK retailer to publish the amount of food wasted in its operations in 2013. It is now more than 70% towards its target that no food that is safe for human consumption goes to waste. Tackling food waste in the home is more complex. This year, Sainsbury\u2019s abandoned a multimillion-pound project to halve food waste in a designated town, Swadlincote in south Derbyshire, after a year-long trial produced disappointing results. The retailer had planned to spend \u00a310m over five years to develop a network of similar schemes across the UK. Clare Oxborrow, a senior food and farming campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cAll companies along the supply chain should publicise their food waste data and commit to concerted long-term action, so that food waste is halved by 2030, as set out in the sustainable development goals.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
