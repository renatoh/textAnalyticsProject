It is rare you feel you can make a difference. But I think I can claim some credit for bringing Peter Alliss up to date with events in the music world. At the Augusta Masters earlier this year, the roly-poly doyen of golf commentary claimed to be \"slightly less avoirdupois\" than Pavarotti, which I was forced to reveal was probably not true given that the late great tenor had died two years previously. I like to think Alliss took his lead from this column, finally giving the LGT a decent burial, in commentary from the Open. Discussing Tiger Woods's failure to make the cut, Alliss said it was \"like going to a Pavarotti concert and finding he's got laryngitis,\" quickly adding, \"when the poor fellow was alive.\" What, I wonder, is it with Alliss and Pavarotti? Alliss compared Tiger to the singer as early as 1999, when asked by The Independent if he expected Woods to fulfil expectations. \"He's in the middle of a learning process,\" said the Voice of Golf, \"Like a young baritone or Pavarotti.\" The laryngitis gag first surfaced when Woods shot 81 in the third round of the 2002 Open, which Alliss described as \"like going to a Pavarotti concert\" and the rest you know. I wonder if he might consider updating the observation now, on the lines of \"it's like going to a Pavarotti concert and finding he's dead.\" Not that I am about to upbraid the well-upholstered master of the mic for self-quotation, having begun the piece you are currently reading by revisiting an earlier triumph. Besides, there is an awful lot of open space to be filled by the golf commentator, \"over 40 hours of live coverage\" as Gary Lineker proudly trumpeted at the start of it all last week. Never having donned a Pringle jumper in anger a lot of the nuances are lost on me, so I treat the commentary largely as not unpleasant background noise. Not conversation so much as chunter. Alliss, of course, is the Pavarotti of chunter, as he would undoubtedly put it. In a typical aside, he read an email from a viewer who thought he might have met the commentator doing national service at Kirkham. \"I was at RAF West Kirby,\" muttered Alliss, \"But it's good to know there was someone who looked like me at Kirkham.\" There is a good deal of this inconsequential chit chat over the four days of the Open, as if the BBC were trying to recreate the experience of the 19th hole at some suburban golf club for those of us unlikely to be admitted into that company, on grounds of insufficient slacks or something. What I like about Alliss is that the more golf changes, the more he stays the same, and as a member of the old guard he was ideally placed to comment on Tom Watson's charge. \"It's nice when you see an old pro like Tom and a young fellow like Ishikawa at the other end of the scale of life,\" he purred, although he was puzzled by the letters RYO on the Japanese player's golf ball. \"I wonder what that stands for?\" asked Alliss. \"It's his name,\" was the response \u2013 from Wayne Grady, I think. Lulled by the chunter, I failed to note the name but it was probably Grady, my favourite commentator. He is knowledgeable, good company and not afraid to chuck in an old joke, something of which I heartily approve. Alliss made some comment about the golfer's DNA, and Grady shot back: \"DNA, that's the national dyslexic association, isn't it?\" I am not so keen on the younger guys like Andrew Cotter, who has too much of the eager beaver about him. If I wanted to sit up straight and pay attention I should not be watching the golf. The BBC's other nod to the changing face of golf, I suppose, were the shots of former enfant terrible Chris Evans, covering the Championship for Radio Five Live. Maybe they were unaware that Evans has now reinvented himself as Ed \"Stewpot\" Stewart, with cosy chats with the travel girl on Radio Two, and reading out texts about listeners' favourite saucepans. The visuals, though, were uniformly brilliant. There were some remarkable super slo-mo shots of seabirds and of showers of grass as the ball was hit out of the rough; and the sequence where Tiger Woods was caught from distance, a lonely figure walking across the great expanse of the fairway as his Open fell to pieces, was classic. Finally, a mention for Super League on Sky, starved of the oxygen of publicity by the Ashes and the Open. There have been two terrific late finishes the last two Fridays, the latest bringing Wakefield victory at St Helens. Rugby league, as we know, has been proven to be the greatest game in the world, by scientists at the University of Hull Kingston Rovers, and now commentator Mike \"Stevo\" Stephenson has come up with another reason to love the game. Commenting on a video refereeing decision with which he did not entirely concur, he said, \"That's the great thing about our game of rugby league. Controversy courts itself, doesn't it?\" Take a bow, Stevo, the Pavarotti of bollocks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
