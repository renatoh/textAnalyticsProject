The Efficiency in Government Unit, a collaboration between two right-wing thinktanks - the Centre for Policy Studies and the Economic Research Council - published the Essential Guide to British Quangos 2005 today. The author Dan Lewis, said government was overusing quangos in policy implementation. \"You think you're getting a change of policy with a government change but actually you're not,\" he said, but could not immediately give an example of where excessive policy had been devolved to quangos. \"There is far more heat than light about quangos,\" he said, adding that transparency and a database such as his are key to creating accountability. However, far from shedding light on the issue, the report confuses matters. \"The Centre for Policy Studies report, part of which looks to food farming and energy-related quangos, is littered with inaccuracies,\" said a spokesman for the Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra). \"Quangos play an important role in guaranteeing the quality of produce for British consumers and in protecting the interests of agricultural workers and employers, to name just two. Defra keeps its public bodies under review.\" A Cabinet Office spokesman added that the guide's headline figure of 111 new quangos created since Labour came to power in 1997 was misleading, as it ignored bodies that have been disbanded or merged, or that now report to devolved bodies. And a further government source added that because the research had been carried out over the course of a year, it was less accurate than the government's database, which gives a snapshot of the numbers. The report was also criticised for focusing too much on the amount of quangos. \"It's far more important to see what does it cost, who they are responsible to,\" Mr Lewis said. He added that the government had stopped publishing its own database, though in fact the latest was released yesterday - late due to a revamp. Breaking down the report, the British Potato Council - dismissed by Mr Lewis as \"the most useless quango\" - markets the \u00a33.6bn industry both domestically and abroad and contributes to exports of potatoes and seeds to the value of \u00a338m. The assistant marketing manager, Kay Hogg, said that contrary to Mr Lewis's view, the council did not charge consumers. She said Mr Lewis's general statement of conclusions ignored the fact that many quangos are covered by a five-year review. A spokeswoman for the Energy Saving Trust (EST), criticised in the report for an agenda that overlapped with the government-funded Carbon Trust, said: \"We don't give it [the report] much credence. If it had come from an organisation that we felt was respected then I think we would [comment].\" The report claimed that the combined annual budget of the two energy trusts would provide 12 million boiler jackets to UK homes. The EST says that only 1 million homes need these jackets, and added that EST should not, in fact, be included on the list as it was a private company, albeit funded in part by government. It is not included on the government's database. Other inaccuracies related to the Wine Standards Board, which declined to comment, the Agricultural Wages Board and Regional Committees and Watervoice, which is understood to be drafting a letter of complaint. Tim Knox of the report's co-sponsor, the Centre for Policy Studies, said the organisation would correct inaccuracies online as soon as they were notified."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
