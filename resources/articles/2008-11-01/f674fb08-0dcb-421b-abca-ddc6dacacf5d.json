He suggests that Somali pirates are victims of circumstance as much as high seas highwaymen, and that the intervention of western naval forces will not solve the piracy problem. Both of these claims may have a kernel of truth, but unfortunately Dr Lehr's analysis makes significant errors of fact and interpretation. There are two major problems with Lehr's argument. First, he buys into the notion that Somali pirates are acting as a coast guard, and that they are primarily interested in the defence of traditional fishing grounds. Were this so, it would hardly explain why the pirates have attacked ships well beyond Somali territorial waters, or why their attacks have been indiscriminate with regards to nationality and type of vessel. The Saudi oil tanker seized the day before yesterday was not, after all, engaged in illegal fishing. Over-fishing off Somalia certainly plays a role in limiting Somali opportunities, but simply because some pirates claim to act as a national defence force doesn't mean that we need to take such claims seriously. Moreover, defending Somali territorial waters from over-fishing would require the kind of naval presences that Lehr decries. Lehr's more serious error involves the claim that local navies can handle the problem of piracy, making the \"western naval squadrons\" unnecessary. He claims as evidence the success enjoyed by southeast Asian states in combating and suppressing piracy earlier this decade. Lehr correctly notes that piracy in southeast Asia has declined, but unfortunately does not grapple with the differences between the southeast Asian and the east African cases. First, the flotilla of warships now patrolling off the Horn of Africa is not entirely western. Malaysia, India, South Korea, Pakistan and China, among others, have all participated. Second, Lehr does not recognise the tremendous differences in capability between the states of east Africa and the nations of southeast Asia. Put simply, the states of east Africa and the Persian Gulf lack significant naval capabilities. Malaysia alone possesses more warships and maritime aircraft than all of the states of east Africa combined. A July Economist article noted that the entirety of east Africa lacks a single modern, operational warship of any significant size or capability. Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand, on the other hand, all have large, modern, capable navies. Moreover, pirates in southeast Asia operated in a smaller geographic area than pirates off the Horn of Africa, meaning that the east African states have to cover more with less. Even when the fleets of Egypt and Saudi Arabia are included, local naval assets that could be devoted to piracy suppression off Somalia are trivial in comparison to similar assets in southeast Asia. Finally, the international community didn't simply sit on its hands and wait for the states of southeast Asia to solve the problem themselves. Japan, China, India and, most of all, the United States offered assistance to and facilitated cooperation among the southeast Asian nations in order to further the fight against piracy. Indeed, even with all of the ships committed by all the navies currently operating off Somalia, the density of naval force in the area does not approach that enjoyed in southeast Asia. Lehr may be correct in saying that the international flotilla can't solve the problem of piracy, but the choice isn't between international enforcement and local enforcement; it's between international enforcement and de facto tolerance of Somali piracy. I also suspect that it's naive to believe that the pirates of Somalia will simply return to fishing if their traditional grounds are left alone. Piracy has become remarkably lucrative, and unless naval forces capable of deterring pirates and exacting costs upon them are present, the fishermen may simply continue to seize vessels and demand ransoms. The industrial nations of Europe, Asia and North America are the primary beneficiaries of free ocean transit. Consequently, they are the primary victims of interruptions in that transit. The navies of these states have a responsibility to keep the seas free, and this means concerted, multilateral action against Somali pirates. Such action may not solve the problem, but inaction only makes it worse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
