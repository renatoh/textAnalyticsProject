Kennedy, the nephew of President John F Kennedy and son of his murdered brother Robert Kennedy, is campaigning against a bill introduced in California that seeks to stop parents opting out of having their children inoculated against diseases such as measles and whooping cough. When he addressed the audience at a screening of a documentary on the subject, Trace Amounts, in Sacramento last week, the high-profile vaccine skeptic made remarks that set off a firestorm of protest. Kennedy said that pharmaceutical companies and the government could not be trusted over the ingredients in vaccines and added of children that he claims get sick as a result of having their jabs: \u201cThey get the shot, that night they have a fever of 103 [degrees], they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone. This is a Holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\u201d On Monday Kennedy expressed regret for his choice of words. \u201cI want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement. \u201cI employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families.\u201d The prominent Democrat and environmentalist has raised eyebrows with his vociferous opposition to childhood vaccinations and skepticism about the related science. He has been promoting the documentary Trace Amounts which blames the mercury-containing vaccine preservative thimerosal for the rise in autism in young children, even though it has been removed from vaccines and, in addition, the international scientific community has discredited the link in recent years. Supporters of mandatory vaccinations point out that the number of children identified with autism is rising despite the widespread removal of thimerosal from vaccines. The bill introduced in California would prevent parents opting out of vaccines for their children for personal or religious choices. The legislation was introduced after an outbreak of measles that started at the Disneyland theme park in the state late last year infected 100 people and was blamed on falling vaccination rates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
