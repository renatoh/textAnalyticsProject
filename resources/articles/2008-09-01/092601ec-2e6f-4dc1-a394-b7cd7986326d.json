We swooped upstairs to our opulent room, flopped on the four-poster bed and switched on the telly. And what was on? Quadrophrenia A young, crazy-eyed Phil Daniels and the mod-rocker riots of the Sixties may be a thing of the past, but the film's recognisable landmarks - the alleyways, pubs and beach - make Brighton inextricably associated with a sense of wild escapism. There may be fewer fights on the seafront these days, but there is still fierce competition for hotel rooms. Finding accommodation in Brighton can be difficult and expensive, and the Royal York is no exception. For a basic double at the weekend you could easily pay \u00a3150 or more a night, \u00a3260 for a suite and \u00a3400 for a large, modern apartment. The Royal York's rooms are, however, more spacious and stylish than most. Though a multimillion pound refurbishment earlier this year has brought modern apartments to the top floor, most of the 51 rooms retain the luxuriance of their original Regency style. Ours, the Queen Adelaide suite, had high ceilings, gold mirrors and velvety flocked wallpaper. The hotel's history proudly lists many famous visitors, and we're told that from our balcony in 1829 the eventual consort to William IV waved to cheering crowds in the square below. Standing on the very same spot as Her Highness, we watched drunken revellers shriek and stumble in the post-pub rain. But not all was perfect. Breakfast is extra; \u00a313.95 for full English. There are no tea/coffee facilities in the room, so you have to pay for room service, or go to the bar. Our bathroom, though modern and kitted out with Molton Brown toiletries, had faulty bath drainage. We heard from other guests that their shower, in a standard room, didn't work at all. They were transferred, at no extra cost, to a suite - but what if the hotel had been full? A dirty weekend indeed. One flawless feature was dinner - a beautifully presented three-course meal for \u00a322, in a grand dining room. I enjoyed yellowfin tuna, cooked to perfection, and an excellent raspberry creme brulee. Sadly, we didn't get to try the in-room spa/massage facility, nor its karaoke rooms. However, both looked good and reasonably priced. Overall then, yes, the Royal York does offer something different, but staying there could wash away your wallet, if not your bathwater. The verdict: Fine rooms and dining; poor plumbing. The cost: Weekend doubles from \u00a3150 room-only. Peter Kimpton"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
