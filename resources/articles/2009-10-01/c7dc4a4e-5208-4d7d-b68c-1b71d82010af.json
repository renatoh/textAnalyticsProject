The Communications Consumer Panel is calling on mobile phone companies to improve the information they give people before they buy a handset and introduce a \"try before you buy\" get-out clause. Several companies, including Vodafone, O2 and T-Mobile, already allow customers to leave if they are not getting the coverage they expected when signing up. While mobile operators are pushing handsets offering the latest in multimedia and web browsing, many users have problems carrying out the most basic of tasks \u2013 such as texting and calling \u2013 due to poor coverage, according to the panel. Its research, out today, shows 56% of consumers and 91% of small-businesses employees have difficulty with mobile coverage: a third say it is a regular experience. Coverage problems include not-spots \u2013 where there is no coverage \u2013 poor quality or intermittent coverage, delayed texts and dropped calls. \"While all the focus is on rolling out new services such as mobile broadband, our research reveals large numbers of consumers and small businesses are still having problems making even basic voice calls,\" according to Communications Consumer Panel chair Anna Bradley.\"This kind of basic coverage is hugely important to consumers and essential for small businesses to thrive.\" This year, regulator Ofcom announced plans to investigate the causes of not-spots and coverage problems, which range from poorly-sited signal masts to inclement weather. Andrew Harrison, UK chief executive of Carphone Warehouse, said that after 20 years of selling mobile phones, \"Will I get a signal' is still the question most asked by customers. \"Network coverage is a critical issue, particularly as the popularity and growth in smartphones looks set to continue and more people look to utilise 3G services via their mobile phones,\" he said. Several mobile phone companies have introduced in-store coverage checkers and allow customers to return their phones if they find they are in a not-spot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
