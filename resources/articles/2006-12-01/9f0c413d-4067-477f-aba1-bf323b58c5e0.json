Everton will write to the Football Association this morning complaining at Mourinho's post-match observations after Chelsea's 3-2 victory at Goodison Park on Sunday, but have consulted their lawyers in the belief that the implication that Johnson cheated was \"quite possibly defamatory\". They insist that the suggestions are damaging the long-term value of a player who cost a club record \u00a38.6m from Crystal Palace in the summer. Mourinho had to be restrained by the fourth official after Johnson tumbled over the Chelsea goalkeeper Hilario. The Chelsea manager had called for the striker to be booked and suggested Johnson was \"dangerous\" to opponents because of the way he \"chased penalties\". Last night Johnson said: \"I believe the incident which was highlighted by Mr Mourinho was badly misinterpreted by him. I feel greatly disappointed that my integrity has been unfairly questioned in this way. I hope the Chelsea manager will retract his statement.\" Everton are seeking an apology, or sanction from the FA, and believe Mourinho's assertions went further than criticisms voiced this season by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Neil Warnock which have handed Johnson a reputation for tumbling too easily. \"To publicly question the integrity of a player of Andrew's professionalism and honesty is not only wholly unacceptable and quite possibly defamatory but also, in our opinion, highly damaging for both club and player,\" read a statement issued by Everton and BaseSoccer. \"We would urge the footballing authorities to look closely at Mr Mourinho's comments and then, perhaps, seek a formal explanation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
