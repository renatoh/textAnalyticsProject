It\u2019s a pleasure to play alongside him and you can see how clinical he is in front of goal. Everyone\u2019s been magic with me [since joining from Celtic in the summer]. This is only my second 90 minutes in five or six months, so I\u2019m just delighted to be back fit.\u201d Group A Qarabag 2-2 Apoel Nicosia Sevilla 3-0 Dudelange Group B Dynamo Kiev 1-1 Copenhagen Malmo 2-1 Lugano Group C Getafe 0-1 Basel Trabzonspor 0-2 Krasnodar Group D PSV Eindhoven 0-0 LASK Sporting Lisbon 1-0 Rosenborg Group E Celtic 2-1 Lazio Rennes 0-1 Cluj Group F Arsenal 3-2 Vitoria Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 Standard Liege Group G Porto 1-1 Rangers Young Boys 2-0 Feyenoord Group H CSKA Moscow 0-1 Ferencvaros Ludogorets 0-1 Espanyol Group I Gent 2-2 Wolfsburg Saint Etienne 1-1 Oleksandria Group J Istanbul Basaksehir 1-0 RZ Pellets Roma 1-1 Borussia Monchengladbach Group K Besiktas 1-2 Sporting Braga Slovan Bratislava 1-2 Wolves Group L AZ Alkmaar 6-0 Astana Partizan Belgrade 0-1 Man Utd Christopher Jullien\u2019s goal is the winner \u2013 but only after Fraser Forster makes a world-class stoppage-time save to deny Cataldi a scorching leveller. Celtic top Group E. Nicolas Pepe gets Arsenal out of jail. Arsenal top Group F. Another stunning postage-stamp free-kick. Unai Emery does not move an inch but applauds his record signing\u2019s work. 90 min: Five added minutes at a rocking Celtic Park for the hosts to hang on. Fraser Forster has just clung on to the ball to take the sting out of a Lazio attack. Meanwhile, there will be three added minutes at the Emirates, where Arsenal have another inviting free-kick 20 yards from goal ... Huge. Ryan Christie, who equalised for Celtic, sends in a corner and Christopher Jullien towers above everyone to glance home. 87 min: Rochinha replaces Davidson. 85 min: It is almost deja vu for Pepe and Arsenal \u2013 but Vit\u00f3ria survive another dangerous free-kick from an almost identical position. 82 min: Shkodran Mustafi, of all people, plays a wondrous weighted pass in behind the Vit\u00f3ria defence. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn ghosts in and cuts the ball back for Martinelli, who is already celebrating in his head. Martinelli does almost everything right but Silva makes a fine save. Arsenal have gone up a gear since that exquisite strike. A \u00a372m strike. Wonderful, curling left-footed effort. 79 min: Vit\u00f3ria\u2019s Pepe pulls back Torreira. Arsenal win a free-kick 25-odd yards from goal. Nicolas Pepe fancies it ... 76 min: The big guns are on at Celtic Park. Ciro Immobile has been summoned in place of Correa, with Lazio determined to up the ante after that equaliser. At Arsenal, a lot rests on Pepe making a splash. Owing to Emery making a double change at the break, Arsenal are all out of subs. Elsewhere in the group, Eintracht Frankfurt are two goals to the good, with the Austria defender Martin Hinteregger adding a second. 75 min: Lacazette is booked for dissent and that\u2019s the forward\u2019s last contribution, with record signing Nicolas Pepe on in his place. 72 min: Arsenal are knocking on the door. Torreira and Lacazette have tried to make in-roads. Nicolas Pepe\u2019s arrival is imminent. 70 min: Marcus Edwards, the former Spurs youngster who opened the scoring at the Emirates, is withdrawn. On comes Andr\u00e9 Pereira. Parity at Celtic Park! Ryan Christie applies a sweeping finish across goal after nifty hold-up play by the striker Odsonne Edouard. 64 min: Pepe is on ... but not for Arsenal. Vit\u00f3ria make a change, with Pedro Rodrigues Pepe on for the visitors in place of Andr\u00e9 Almeida. 59 min: Lacazette makes the most of a contretemps with Garc\u00eda \u2013 it\u2019s handbags at most \u2013 but the Frenchman pretends he\u2019s been head butted. Nice try. Garc\u00eda gets a booking for his part in giving Lacazette a minor bump bu the referee\u2019s not buying the Arsenal forward\u2019s theatrics. Lacazette is fortunate to escape a yellow. 55 min: Rennes, who are in Celtic\u2019s group, are having a nightmare at home to Cluj. Not only do they trail 1-0 but the Ligue 1 side are also down to nine men after Eduardo Camavinga joined Edouard Mendy in being sent off. 54 min: Smith Rowe volleys wide! The Arsenal midfielder ends up shinning it for a goal-kick, after good work down the left flank by Tierney, who bombed to the byline before delivering a tricky cross. Tierney\u2019s cross was cleared by the visitors, but only as far as Smith Rowe, who failed to punish Vit\u00f3ria. 51 min: Celtic are yet to get going this half \u2013 and nor are Arsenal. 50 min: Arsenal go to sleep in defence \u2013 again \u2013 and Davidson nips in to head at goal. But his effort is straight at a grateful Mart\u00ednez, who saved from Almeida at his near post moments earlier. 49 min: Mustafi nods wide! The German defender gets up above his marker to meet Dani Ceballos\u2019s beautiful first-time cross, but the execution is not good enough. His header is off target and Vit\u00f3ria surge forward up the other end. 47 min: Smith Rowe does well, really well ... but then Lucas Torreira runs into trouble after picking up the pass. Smith Rowe, the academy graduate from Croydon, has been lively. He has probably been the best of a bad bench thus far. At Celtic Park, Lazio and Celtic renew battle. No changes. 46 min: Arsenal needed to change something \u2013 and Unai Emery has at the break. Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Joe Willock have been withdrawn. Dani Ceballos and Matteo Guendouzi on. Mesut \u00d6zil? He\u2019s at home with his feet up. Europa League half-time scores on the doors: Group A Sevilla 0-0 Dudelange Group B Dynamo Kiev 0-1 Copenhagen Malmo 2-0 Lugano Group C Getafe 0-1 Basel Trabzonspor 0-0 Krasnodar Group D PSV Eindhoven 0-0 LASK Sporting Lisbon 0-0 Rosenborg Group E Celtic 0-1 Lazio Rennes 0-1 Cluj Group F Arsenal 1-2 Vitoria Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 Standard Liege The Scottish Premiership leaders trail at the interval. Bruno Duarte\u2019s goal gives the Portuguese side the lead at the break. Lazio kill Celtic on the counterattack. Manuel Lazzari cuts in from the right flank and smashes the ball beyond a hapless Fraser Forster. Back in north London at the Emirates, Davidson sends a shot just past Emiliano Mart\u00ednez\u2019s left post! The Arsenal goal has been under siege throughout this first half. 38 min: Vit\u00f3ria\u2019s tails are up now. Meanwhile, up at Celtic Park, the winger Callum McGregor lashes an effort at goal \u2013 but his shot is deflected wide. Shambolic defending by Arsenal. So sloppy. Bruno Duarte da Silva punishes Arsenal after Davidson drove forward and rattled a post. It was Ainsley Maitland-Niles who surrendered possession after a hospital pass by Torreira. In fairness Duarte\u2019s finish was better than he will get credit for \u2013 he absolutely rifled it in after seizing on Davidson\u2019s seconds. Arsenal are back to square one. 33 min: Emile Smith Rowe almost adds a second \u2013 but his shot deflects just wide of goal. Smith Rowe was slid in by Joe Willock. Arsenal have woken up. Gabriel Martinelli nods in Kieran Tierney\u2019s cross. It was a wonderful ball in from the left and the teenager, left unmarked in the box, glanced home. It was Tierney\u2019s first meaningful foray down the flank and how Arsenal and Martinelli were rewarded, with the striker heading in to give Unai Emery\u2019s side something to build on after the most lacklustre start imaginable. 29 min: At last, Arsenal seem to be stirring. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn skates down the right and whips in a cross, which Martinelli tries and fails to meet. Arsenal waste the resulting corner but that\u2019s about as good as it\u2019s got thus far. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt lead Standard Liege 1-0 courtesy of Tammy David Abraham. 25 min: Martinelli tries to break from halfway but ultimately the teenager gets crowded out, with Venancio intervening. Credit to Martinelli, who then goes bustling after it \u2013 the Brazilian wants a second bite of the cherry \u2013 but Vit\u00f3ria snuff him out. Meanwhile, get a load of Jamie Jackson\u2019s report from Belgrade: 23 min: H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn is again exposed down the Arsenal right, with the Portuguese side furrowing into a gaping hole left by the full-back. A low cross trickles into the box but Arsenal eventually clear their lines. 21 min: Emery asked his Arsenal players for an aggressive and passionate display. This is not it. They have been lukewarm at best. 17 min: Emile Smith Rowe turns beautifully but the visitors get the block in, just as the Arsenal youngster pulls the trigger. Meanwhile, in Group E, Cluj have taken the lead away to Rennes, with Ciprian Deac striking. Celtic remain level-pegging at 0-0 \u2013 but Ryan Christie has just rattled the woodwork for the hosts. 16 min: Arsenal really have not going. A penny for the thoughts of Mesut \u00d6zil, who continues to up the stakes in the the PR war. Around 15 minutes before kick-off, he tweeted a picture of him training with Robert Pires. 12 min: Arsenal, it is fair to say, are at sixes and sevens defensively. They are all over the shop. The Vit\u00f3ria fans are really enjoying themselves. It was some finish from Edwards. The former Spurs winger strikes. Of course. The 20-year-old, who was born in Camden Town, a stone\u2019s throw from the Emirates, opens the scoring. It is a brilliant finish but Edwards wrings both Kieran Tierney and H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn inside out, twisting and turning in the box before getting the shot off, firing across goal. Arsenal did not heed that earlier warning. 5 min: It has not been the most riveting start at the Emirates. Andr\u00e9 Almeida was allowed to swivel inside the box by Rob Holding and the Portuguese fired off a shot but, in the end, it lacked conviction. It was a well-worked move, with Vit\u00f3ria scooting in off the right. At Celtic, a goal-saving block by Jacinto Quissanga prevents Odsonne Edouard from giving the hosts an early lead. A reminder of the team news: Arsenal v Vit\u00f3ria Arsenal: Martinez; Beller\u00edn, Mustafi, Holding, Tierney; Torreira, Willock; Maitland-Niles, Smith Rowe, Martinelli; Lacazette Subs: Leno, Chambers, Kolasinac, Ceballos, Guendouzi, Pepe, Saka Vit\u00f3ria: Silva; Garcia, Venancio, Tapsoba, Hanin; Almeida, Agu, Poha; Edwards, Duarte, Davidson Subs: Douglas, Pedrao, Bonatini, Rochinha, Mohamed, Pereira, Pepe Celtic v Lazio Celtic: Forster; Elhamed, Jullien, Ajer, Bolingoli-Mbombo; Brown, McGregor; Forrest, Christie, Elyounoussi; Edouard Subs: Gordon, Bauer, Hayes, Bitton, Sinclair, Rogic, Bayo Lazio: Strakosha; Bastos, Vavro, Acerbi; Lazzari, Parolo, Leiva, Milinkovic-Savic, Jony; Caicedo, Correa Subs: Marchi, Gil, Berisha, Immobile, Lulic, Guerrieri, Cataldi Anyway, that\u2019s us \u2013 Ben Fisher will take you through the rest of the night. Arsenal are coming out against Vitoria - they line up like this: AZ giving Astana six tells you all you need to know about United. They are rotten. Let\u2019s round up the other results *performs extremely James Alexander Gordon voice*: Besiktas 1-2 Braga Roma 1-1 Gladbach CSKA 0-1 Ferencvaros Qarabag 2-2 Apoel Ludogorets -1 Espanyol St Etienne 1-1 Oleksandriya Gent 2-2 Wolfsburg Istanbul Basaksehir 1-0 Wolfsberg AZ 6-0 Astana In the studio, Paul Scholes and Robin van Persie are laying into United, with sadness. Scholes laments the fact that there is no good football, no little moves to enjoy, no signs of progress. He notes that they only look dangerous on the counter \u2013 otherwise, they\u2019re painful to watch. That\u2019s very impressive from Wolves, who were much improved in the second half. If they win the return in two weeks, they\u2019ll be very nearly through. What a result that is! Rangers earned the everything out of that, solid at the back and in goal, committed in midfield and aggressive in attack. They sit second in the group with four points; Porto have four points too, while Young Boys have six and Feyenoord three. United win away for the first time since March, for the first time in five weeks their defence has seen out an odd-goal advantage, and they\u2019re nearly. That\u2019s the good news; the bad news is that they looked pretty poor while so doing, producing almost no decent football and needing a penalty to shade miserable opponents. Three additional minutes in Oporto... Four additional minutes in Bratislava... Three additional minutes in Belgrade... I\u2019m afraid I missed what happened, but he went for two bookable offences. Can Wolves hang on? McGregor to the rescue! What a double save! First, when a ball is flighted to the far post, he saves Soares\u2019 volleyed shot, and then, when Luiz tees up Danilo, he extends a foot to save again. Barisic curls just over the top. Morelos seizes on a loose pass and sets off towards goal. He\u2019s forced wide and Pepe doesn\u2019t need asking twice, upending him as soon as there\u2019s no risk of a red card. Free-kick Rangers, just outside the box, right of centre; Gerrard brings on Arfield and Ojo for Barker and Jack, Braga now lead in Istanbul. If the scores stay as are, they\u2019ll be top of the group with seven points, in front of Wolves with six, Bratislava with four and Besiktas with 1. And have a look! Partizan win a corner, it goes to Asano at the near post, and he contorts nicely to send a header goalwards as Williams charges the space, playground style, but Romero makes a really smart reaction save. United, though, do not like clean sheets. Bloody hell, it\u2019s been a good few days for Andreas Pereira. First, he does well against Liverpool, now he\u2019s coming on for James Garner like he\u2019s some sort of first choice, as United try and hold on for the win. Rangers are giving as good as they get in Oporto. \u201cWill you please stop interrupting the discussion of City of God with meaningless references to football, please?\u201d asks Andy Wilson. \u201cOut Goodfellas Goodfellas.\u201d It\u2019s rare to see a film whose aesthetic is so overwhelming, but that is one. The pace is also perfect, absorbingly quick, but slow when it needs to be. In United\u2019s group, AZ are 2-0 up at home to Astana. Most likely, everyone else beats them twice so the group will be decided by the three-way between United, Partizan and AZ. In Wolves\u2019 group, Besiktas have equalised against Braga. Nice from Partizan, Nacho into Soumah, who touches off first-time for Sadiq, who spanks low and just wide. United are struggling to get out here. For example... \u201cThe photo of Morelos celebrating his goal for Rangers made me do a double take,\u201d emails Peter Oh. \u201cI don\u2019t recall Rangers ever having worn red in the past. Could it be the influence of their Liverpool legend of a manager? Come on you Reds!\u201d I seem to recall some McEwan\u2019s Lager red yins in the 90s \u2013 union flag and all that. \u201cWith the talent coming through, it\u2019s even more baffling to give new deals to the likes of Smalling, Young, Jones and Mata,\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cAll peripheral players - to even further block the progress of the kids. I\u2019d rather see Williams on the left than Young, but then I thought Borthwick-Jackson looked decent when he first got a run of games.\u201d Two brilliant low crosses at Stamford Bridge, if I remember correctly. Smalling did an ok job last season and I\u2019d have kept him over Jones if i could, promoted Tuanzebe and spent the Maguire money on a midfielder or two. Mata, I think, is there for the dressing room and as a potential coach, but yes, I\u2019d have lozzed him and all. Young i\u2019d have kept because he\u2019s one of few who knows what a good team needs, but I\u2019d not be picking him ahead of Williams or Laird at this point. It\u2019s getting tasty in Belgrade, with Nacho and Miletic booked in quick succession. Jimenez skips into the ball and the keeper moves to his right, so the slot goes the other way. Wolves have been excellent second half. Vinagre crosses, the defender shoves Jimenez, and the ref has an easy call to make. United make a double change, replacing Martial and Wan-Bissaka, who will be needed at the weekend, with Rashford and James. I\u2019m not sure about that one - I guess that if they win here they\u2019re nearly through, but those two need a rest and will definitely start at Norwich on Sunday. I\u2019d prbably have spared both the trip. Wolves respond by bringing on Jota for Gibbs-White. Oh dear. Saiss is allowed room to shoot from distance, strikes across the ball but not cleanly, and Greif waits until the last second to decide that needs to save it even so, and it bobbles past him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a masterpiece,\u201d says Peter Cocker of City of God. I agree. I\u2019d go as far as to say that it\u2019s perfect. Wolves are well on top now; United have done nothing so far this half. What a save! Rangers break again, Barisic slings over another lovely cross, and Morelos is up again! He makes great contact too, but heads too close to Marchesin, who adjusts hands brilliantly to shove over the top. Dear oh dear! Soumah runs at Maguire who sells himself like a cheap thrill, diving in and opening up the way to goal. But Soumah panics, rushing his shot that bobbles wide. In Bratislava, Nuno has introduced Traore and he\u2019s already made a difference, just missing Jimenez with a cross after a charge down the right. Soumah runs at Jones who again does well, standing strong, somehow refraining from giving away a penalty, and seeing the danger away. It\u2019s kind of strange how Solskjaer has handled his young players, only giving them minutes when he\u2019s got no choice or when games are nearly over. Mason Greenwood looks ready, and Brandon Williams looks better than both Shaw and Young to me, and given that United are aiming to be competitive in a year or two, not not, worth giving a run. Nacho goes low with the free-kick, from 20 yards and left of centre, bobbling it past the far post. That\u2019s a brilliant challenge. I\u2019m not sure how the ref has apprised a foul there. Sadiq gets away again, Jones makes what looks like a really good challenge, and the ref gives a free-kick on the edge. Off we go again in Belgrade. \u201c I think my Sunday league team circa 1976 would have given this Partizan team a game,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cThey really are *anglo saxon*. Then again, Martial seems unable to even pick the right studs. Huh, cue him scoring!\u201d A mate in the away end sent me this: Me: Got your binoculars? Him: It\u2019s not that bad as it goes. Me: The further away the better, I guess. Him: Yes! Elsewhere: in Wolves\u2019 group, Braga now lead away to Besiktas. Porto have been comfortably the better side, but Rangers have still threatened and their goal was a peach. I wonder how long it\u2019ll be till we see Neves and Jonny because Wolves have played ok, but are lacking their usual control. United started fairly but the penalty came just as Partizan were asserting themselves. Barisic gets down the left and crosses low and long to the far side of the box, where Morelos collects and absolutely buries an expert\u2019s finish inside the near post. That is very, very well done. The keeper dives to his left and Martial eases the ball to his right. It\u2019s not as comic as when Pogba misses, but it serves a different purpose. Williams dashes into the box, Pavlovic shoves him then trips him, and that\u2019s a penalty! Partizan are crying, but I really can\u2019y see why. Here comes Sadiq again, finding Asano, and though Jones robs him, he\u2019s already on the way down, and his momentum sends him right into the ball, conjuring a shot which goes wide. It\u2019s all kicking off! Sadiq, Partizan\u2019s leading scorer, picks up a loose ball just outside the United box, advances, and caresses a glorious curling sidefooter onto the post, about halfway up! Eeek! Morelos climbs high to power-glance a header onto the bar! On the bench, Gerrard makes that face I know you\u2019re picturing. Lingard hits the post! Wan-Bissaka does really well to win the ball on the edge of the Partizan box, tees him up, and from 20 yards, he carefully places an effort against the base of the woodwork. Rangers, silky devils that they are, try to play their way out when clearing a corner. Someone \u2013 Jack, I think \u2013 finds Luis Diaz, just outside the box, and he skips infield a little before unfurling a delicious curler that hisses and spits its way past McGregor. Bratislava are looking ok against Wolves now; the other game in that group, Besiktas v Braga, is 0-0. Oh! Ze Luis climbs high and hangs long to fling a header against the post. Porto are coming. Goal in Rome! The excellent Zaniolo has put the home side ahead against Gladbach. Wolfsburg now lead 2-0 in Gent; Apoel have equalised at Qarabag. ...Alex Telles curls over the bar. Young Boys now lead Feyenoord 2-0; they currently sit top of Rangers\u2019 group. Meanwhile, Morelos gives the ball away, Marega nashes towards the box, and Jack bumps him over. He\u2019s booked, and Porto have a free-kick... Rangers are doing well yakno, and get the ball out to Tavernier, nicely bouncing in front of him. But he doesn\u2019t get his knee over it, lashing high and then some. I\u2019ve been watching United for more than 35 years now, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen less compelling football than in the Europa League group stages. I guess there are too many teams in the Champions League, but though the current standard isn\u2019t great, that it\u2019s improved massively in the era is unarguable. A nice pass from Garner finds Wan-Bissaka, and the ball goes back to McTominay. He has a man free outside him but opts to shoot \u2013 I don\u2019t think anyone will chastise him for that, given hwo scared United usually are of the same \u2013 and doesn\u2019t catch it perfectly, so it lopes just wide. Back in Oporto, Kent has another run, winning a corner. It goes short, but the eventuating shot \u2013 I didn\u2019t see whose \u2013 is blocked. Goals not in our featured games: Qarabag 1-0 Apoel Ludogorets 0-1 Espanyol St Etienne 1-1 Oleksandriya Young Boys 1-0 Feyenoord Pavlovic clatters Martial as they contest a high ball, and that\u2019s a free-kick to United, 25 yards out, left of centre. I don\u2019t think Mata can kick the ball as far as the goal, but he can curl a luscious cross onto McTominay\u2019s brow! But, not for the first time, he misses a free header; what an oversight that is. As I was saying! With their first attack, a goal! A fine pass with the outside of the foot sends Sporar away at inside-left, and when you\u2019re in nick you\u2019re in nick! He slows Coady down, moves off, and his shot clips the defender on its way inside the near post. It\u2019s been a quiet start in Bratislava, but the territorial advantage is with Wolves. Extremely tangentially, I rewatched City of God for the first time in years the other night. I cannot remember being so dazzled, visually and thematically, since the first day I saw it, when I went to the cinema in the afternoon, then again in the evening. Any more for any more? At the Dragao, Corona has just slung over a lovely cross that Ze Luis headed wide. \u201cPlease explain for me Ed Woodward\u2019s disparaging comments about Daley Blind,\u201d requests Robert Hisnay. \u201cWho would you rather have, Rojo or Blind?\u201d As someone who hates United marginally less than every other football club in the world, I was sad to see Blind leave United. I think what happened was that they needed to raise money and he was one of very few any other club wanted. Mourinho never fancied him though \u2013 when he arrived, he didn\u2019t even list him as a centre-back, was then forced to play him there, dropped him as soon as he made a mistake and never really acknowledged his role in the Europa League win. He is in different league to Rojo and also quite the dish. Porto win a corner which Goldson heads clear and immediately Kent is on his bike, running through the first challenge and screeching all the way to the other box before his touch forsakes him. That\u2019s exactly what Gerrard has planned. Wolfsburg have taken the lead in Gent. Decent move by United down the right, featuring Jones and Lingard, but Wan-Bissaka can\u2019t find a cross. He\u2019ll need to improve that part of his game if United are to make this system work - and I actually wonder whether, long-term, he might just make a centre-back. The raw materials are all there. First of many: Marcos Rojo clips aimlessly forward ... though not via rabona. We\u2019re away in Oporto ... and Belgrade... The Dragao is extremely unfull, and perhaps that\u2019ll help Rangers. They\u2019ve taken a decent contingent, who can make themselves heard in the proper manner. I should note that Nuno has picked a strong team in Bratislava. I daresay he fancies a long run in this competition and why not? Wolves are an absolute bastard to play against, and have the attackers to give any team agita. The players are tunnelled... \u201cThe improved performance against Liverpool has me hopeful about United again,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cIn my optimism I see us winning the Europa, finishing third in the league, signing the Norwegian Beast, and challenging for the title next season. Ah, hope...\u201d United could still make the top four \u2013 when people criticise them, they forget to note that they\u2019ve been missing six of their first XI. I\u2019d still have spent the Maguire money on the midfield, but I understand why Solskjaer didn\u2019t. Steven Gerrard tells BT that his team need to show belief in and out of possession, have a structure and defend aggressively. He also says that his ball-carriers and fast players \u2013 his \u201cone v one merchants\u201d \u2013 have to take responsibility when they can, but he accepts that Porto will have a lot of the ball. He\u2019s looking forward to watching Barker, who\u2019s been picked with that in mind. Partizan were meant to be playing behind closed doors after racism from their crowd, but managed to get around the ban on a technicality, giving tickets away for free to kids and such. In the BT studio, Robin van Persie makes the point that walking off should not be a responsibility foisted upon the players \u2013 the officials should intervene on their behalf. Other things to note about United\u2019s XI: Martial, whose ambling shift against Liverpool was not at all good but whom United have unarguably missed, returns from the start; Lingard, who\u2019s been horrible for months, is also back; and Jimmy Garner, who is now far too good for age-group football, makes his first start. I believe there are reservations about his power and speed, but he\u2019s an intelligent and incisive passer of the ball. So, do Manchester United now play 3-5-2? That they\u2019re doing so tonight, with radically different personnel to those who played against Liverpool, suggests a policy decision. And it\u2019s not an inexplicable decision, given a surfeit a centre-backs and an absence of wingers. The question is whether something that worked against Liverpool, who demand a special plan, is necessarily something that will work all the time.

Elsewhere, Rangers visit Porto, an enticing fixture in the first instance, but one which acquires an entirely new dimension when it puts Pepe will be be in direct proximity to Alfredo Morelos. Oooh yeah! And Wolves are also in action, away at Slovan Bratislava, though the pick of the ties \u2013 wait for it, because you\u2019re not going to believe me \u2013 doesn\u2019t involve a British club. I know! But believe me, it\u2019s true, because we\u2019ve got Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Bundesliga leaders, entertaining Roma, sixth in Serie A! And these are just the early games! Later on, we\u2019ve got Arsenal-Vit\u00f3ria, Celtic-Lazio ... and they\u2019re live!
