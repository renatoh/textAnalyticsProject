So having her Jewishness questioned when she wanted to marry was shocking and humiliating. The news, delivered in a summons to a rabbinical court, came out of the blue. Not only could she not be married by the rabbinate, she was told, but her very status as Jewish was being questioned, in a case now being challenged before Israel\u2019s supreme court. Reut \u2013 who asked not to be identified to prevent further issues for her family \u2013 is not alone. According to figures seen by the Observer, she is one of a growing number of Israeli citizens who, despite being recognised as Jewish by the state, have had their Jewishness questioned by an official rabbinate that enjoys an almost exclusive monopoly on state marriage and other issues. This was once a rare issue that affected only a handful of Israelis, but this has changed under a newly assertive chief rabbinate, dominated by the ultra-orthodox. A group called ITIM: Resources and Advocacy for Jewish Life, which is representing Reut and other families, says the rabbinate has summoned scores of people in the past two years for investigation to prove their Jewish status. According to figures acquired by the group under a freedom of information request, there was an increase of 100% from 2011-2016 in the number of people labelled \u201cpending confirmation of Jewish status\u201d. In the same period there has been a 460% rise in the number of people rejected as \u201cnon-Jews\u201d by the rabbinical courts. This is both shaming and painful, as Reut attests, and many of those affected have chosen to keep their experience private to protect other relatives whose own Jewishness could also be questioned. \u201cThese are family members who have undergone thorough examination of their Jewishness and came to live in Israel,\u201d lawyers for Reut and ITIM argued in an appeal contesting that the rabbinical courts have no authority, by law, to investigate or reject, on their own initiative, the Jewishness of Israeli citizens. \u201cSuddenly and without their will or consent, a cloud of doubt is cast over their Jewishness. They are required to answer to the rabbinical court, without having done anything to deserve a trial over their identity. There is not enough space to describe the personal and emotional damage this situation creates.\u201d The sudden rise in investigations also coincides with a vaguely worded but far-reaching ruling issued by the rabbinical courts in 2016 calling for investigation if \u201ca doubt has arisen considering the Jewishness of a relative\u201d requiring the courts \u201cto clarify the matter of their Jewishness for the purpose of marriage according to Jewish law\u201d. The increase comes amid a wider cultural conflict between the ultra-orthodox-dominated chief rabbinate and less hardline groups in Israel and the wider Jewish diaspora over what it means to be Jewish and who is allowed to define Jewishness. This led, among other things, to a clash this year over plans to allow men and women to pray together at Jerusalem\u2019s Western Wall. It has also resulted in the disclosure of an alleged \u201cblacklist\u201d of 160 rabbis worldwide whom the rabbinate does not trust to check the Jewishness of immigrants to Israel: among the names on the list is the US rabbi who oversaw the conversion of Ivanka Trump. Reut\u2019s problem is that she came to Israel from the former Soviet Union aged 10 months, the granddaughter of an orphaned Holocaust survivor adopted by a non-Jewish couple who made antisemitic comments to her. Her grandmother was scarred by her experience, Reut said, and after fleeing her adoptive parents as a teenager hid the fact she was Jewish on official USSR papers, a decision that has come back to haunt their family. \u201cWhen I decided to get married I knew I would have to go through a registration process so I got in touch with a religious organisation that helps with the paperwork,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cOne of the rabbis said it was problematic because we didn\u2019t have my grandmother\u2019s birth certificate, but that they would try to find it in the archive.\u201d But far from helping Reut, the rabbi instead raised the issue of her Jewishness with the rabbinate. \u201cThe next thing I knew,\u201d she recalled, \u201cwas that I had been summoned to a rabbinical court in Tel Aviv to discuss my Jewish status.\u201d The process led to Reut, her brother and her mother being listed as \u201cnot Jewish\u201d according to the rabbinate. Rabbi Seth Farber, director of ITIM, says it is a question of how Jewishness is defined in Israel, and how the rabbinate is using this \u2013 not least for almost a million former Soviet Jews who came to Israel under a state-administered right of return that has already ruled on their Jewish status for citizenship purposes. \u201cThis is a very worrisome trend. Israel is a nation of immigrants. If this continues, it puts in danger the most basic human rights of more than a million citizens,\u201d said Farber. \u201cBeyond this, it is also against Jewish law, which states that one must take at their word a person who says they are Jewish. A small group is imposing its fundamentalist views on the Israeli immigrant population. \u201cFor the first 50 years of the state it was largely a pro forma thing. You defined yourself as Jewish and you brought witnesses who said you were Jewish. But then as the rabbinate became more powerful and independent, and as new technology allowed it, it became no longer a question of trust. \u201cA whole department was created to check on documentation which morphed \u2013 seven years ago \u2013 into the compilation of an entire handbook. That was the first time such a book was published. That all led to the latest development, the initiating of Jewishness investigations, a process that started escalating in 2015. And now it appears they\u2019re not only checking people registering to get married but rechecking people already married if they have any basis for suspicion.\u201d Farber believes there is a wider issue at stake than simply individuals and families. \u201cIt\u2019s about what Israel is going to be. We don\u2019t interrogate Jews and put them through investigations.\u201d He links recent moves by the chief rabbinate and courts in part to Israeli coalition politics, which has allowed the small ultra-orthodox parties that prop up prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing government to wield disproportional influence. For Reut the experience has been humiliating. \u201cIt was very important to me to get married according to Jewish law. In the end I had to go through a private organisation to do it and then get married in Cyprus to be recognised as married under civil law in Israel. \u201cI feel like a second-class citizen. It is absolutely ridiculous that as an Israeli citizen who goes to synagogue every week I am not allowed to get married here just because someone decided they had doubts about my Jewishness.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
