Jason Puncheon cradled the departing Liverpool captain\u2019s head in his hands and muttered words into his right ear that Gerrard later admitted he could hardly hear. The veteran, emotionally spent by the finality of it all, could offer only a pat to the back of the head in return. Puncheon\u2019s had been an expression of reverence in that exchange for a player destined for Los Angeles, respect born not only of everything a famous figure had achieved but also for what he had come to represent to a wider audience. \u201cFor me, Steven was a local lad who had been playing for Liverpool \u2013 his club \u2013 and therefore someone I\u2019d always idolised, so I told him: \u2018Massive credit to you for what you\u2019ve done in your career. Thanks for even being on the same pitch as me,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cTo know that was possible, that a young kid can push on, come through and play for \u2018his\u2019 club \u2026 well, that was a massive driving force for me.\u201d His own route home has been more tortuous. For too long Puncheon was pigeonholed as a journeyman, a player forever out on loan \u2013 whether from Plymouth or Southampton \u2013 or on the move, who had never properly laid down roots. He was enrolled in Crystal Palace\u2019s youth setup until he was 10 before leaving for Chelsea, and that dismal peak-time commute around the South Circular, and then Wimbledon. He was part of the exodus to Milton Keynes and went on to play in all four divisions in spells at seven clubs. But, from the outside looking in, it was all too nomadic, the flashes of quality all too fleeting. It took him 17 years to return to where it had all begun. Now, two and a half seasons into his senior career back at Selhurst Park, a stone\u2019s throw from where he grew up, he is settled, thriving and cherished. That masterclass in Gerrard\u2019s final Anfield appearance was not an anomaly. He had dismantled Manchester City earlier in the campaign and his goals had fuelled the team\u2019s survival the previous year under Tony Pulis. At 29 he remains just as integral to Alan Pardew\u2019s revitalised side, an industrious creator and supplier to Palace\u2019s flair on the flanks. The manager considers him part of a core of senior players \u2013 namechecking him recently alongside Damien Delaney and Scott Dann \u2013 who have experienced life at the lower levels and whose commitment and drive make them mainstays of an upwardly mobile side. Yet a figure who freely admits to \u201cgetting up to no good\u201d on the streets of south London too often as a teenager has taken that one step further of late. He sees his responsibilities extending these days to informal mentoring of Palace\u2019s youth-team players, offering advice and encouragement to youngsters for whom football provides escapism. Even hope. \u201cIt\u2019s just about being able to relate to them,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up in this area, so I know what it is like here, how hard it can be and the way it tests you like other places don\u2019t. These are young kids. Look at Wilfried Zaha: if he\u2019d had Sir Alex Ferguson to work with him up at Manchester United, he might have had a bit more time with them. I still think he can get back to that level, because he\u2019s a bloody good player, but people won\u2019t understand [the challenges] unless they\u2019ve lived in these parts of south London and can see the difficulties people face every day. I\u2019ll always insist it\u2019s different to elsewhere. There are kids here who have had properly hard upbringings. Some of those kids\u2019 parents have never come to watch them. They\u2019ve never had that support, that guidance. \u201cThe manager we have here understands them \u2013 he\u2019s been around it, and gives them his time \u2013 and gets the area. If I can help them by speaking with them, I do. Just to keep them focused. Not all of them are going to make it in football, but these kids have to understand that, even if they don\u2019t make it at Palace, they might somewhere else: in the Championship, in League One, in League Two. And it\u2019s still a career. You can make a very, very good living and career just by playing in the lower leagues. It doesn\u2019t have to be at the top of the Premier League. They need to make the most of the opportunity they\u2019ve got because, if they\u2019re suddenly released at 21 and football is all they know, they can feel lost.\u201d He speaks from experience. Homesick and misunderstood by Danny Wilson at MK Dons, where he had been in digs in a top-floor apartment in a \u201cspare house\u201d within the grounds of the estate of the owner, Pete Winkelman, he had been cast adrift. He turned 20 without a club, his life in danger of veering away from the game and into murkier worlds until Nabile Hakimi, a long-standing friend now turned football agent, \u201cput his arm round me, told me to stay away from what I was doing and concentrate on football\u201d. There were trials and friendlies at Fisher Athletic and Lewes, down at the Dripping Pan ground. Paul Fairclough was persuaded, against his better judgment, to offer him a place on a mass trial for youngsters up at Barnet. Of the 36 players who attended, Puncheon was the only one asked back. The month-to-month contract was eventually formalised, the winger\u2011cum\u2011striker establishing himself as a cult figure at Underhill. \u201cPaul just gave me the platform and let me play my football,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd sometimes when you are a young kid with some ability, you just need to be able to express what you can do.\u201d Paul Sturrock paid \u00a3250,000 to sign him for Plymouth. Pardew forked out a similar amount to lure him to Southampton, then of League One and the visitors to Selhurst Park on Saturday, in 2010. Palace would not pay an awful lot more to rubber-stamp his next permanent move three years, and four loan spells, later. \u201cI found Plymouth hard but when I joined the gaffer at Southampton he\u2019d drum into me: \u2018Concentrate, prepare.\u2019 Eventually it dawns on you. All that time in the lower leagues made me more determined, but arriving at St Mary\u2019s \u2026 that\u2019s when you realise the pressure, the expectation, the calibre of players you\u2019re in with. I had some great times down there \u2013 OK, some up and down times \u2013 and I can\u2019t complain at all with the way my career has gone because I\u2019ve learned so much through it all. I wouldn\u2019t want to change the way I got to this level. Some players get to the top too quickly, and then they drop just like that. I\u2019ve played for good clubs, in all four divisions and with some good players. \u201cBut, in the back of my mind, I always knew I\u2019d go back to Palace. I\u2019d had their kit when I was growing up round the corner, even if I followed Ian Wright when he went to Arsenal. There were times when it was close to happening, but it went through at the right time [under Ian Holloway, initially on loan, upon promotion in 2013]. I\u2019m here now and this is where my heart is. The club\u2019s only gone forward in the last few years.\u201d That progress has been startling. This team have established themselves with mid-table finishes in the past two years and collide with Southampton, such a role model of resurgence themselves, sixth in the table. Palace have never boasted a stronger squad, their group the ideal blend of experienced older heads with points to prove, and eager young legs. Critically, they have retained the work ethic which propelled them into the Premier League in the first place. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong core, people willing to stick together and push forward as one,\u201d adds Puncheon. \u201cWe showed that at Everton on Monday against a really good side. Yes, there\u2019ll be sticky periods and tough times but, if necessary, that core can carry the group and make sure we get through them together. \u201cWe have massive potential, people like Wilfried with youth on their side, and very good players coming to good ages: Yohan Cabaye, who\u2019s been great for the team; Yannick Bolasie who can go past two or three people like \u2018that\u2019. But we have to achieve something. I don\u2019t know whether that means getting into Europe, or reaching an FA Cup final, but we have to target something and achieve it. It would be a letdown given the ability this team has if we didn\u2019t manage that. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most talented teams I\u2019ve played in and a lot of the people in that dressing room would say the same thing. If you\u2019d said when I joined Palace that, in three seasons, we might be challenging for European football I\u2019d have laughed. But when this team fires on all cylinders, it\u2019s capable of doing anything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
