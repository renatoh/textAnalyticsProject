Ms Kroes, who fined Microsoft \u20ac280.5m (\u00a3189m) in July for failing to comply with commission rulings and could yet impose more fines of up to \u20ac3m a day, insisted she was not pursuing a vendetta against the group. The Dutch commissioner, a former business executive, is known to endure frosty relations with senior Microsoft officials and is said to have spoken out because of what she sees as intimidatory tactics by them. Her last conversation with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, in late August, ended in mutual silence and recrimination. Since then, relations have become frostier with the company's supporters accusing the commission of delaying the European launch of its upgraded operating system, Vista, with a string of demands. Ms Kroes said in a letter to the Financial Times that the commission's actions were \"guided by the desire to create the most innovation-friendly business climate in Europe to the ultimate benefit of European consumers\". She added that, throughout extensive discussions with the group, her aim was to prevent a \"near-monopoly\", known for its anti-competitive conduct around the globe, from releasing a product that \"could have the clear potential to hinder effective competition in the market\". Her predecessor, Mario Monti, fined Microsoft a record \u20ac497m in March 2004 for abuse of market dominance and, in the current reprise of its then accusations, the commission is concerned that the group has \"bundled\" too many functions into Vista, including a search engine, that could prevent consumers from buying rivals' products. Last week Microsoft warned that the commission's actions could stop it improving Vista's security system to ward off hackers but Ms Kroes said: \"This is categorically not the case. We do nevertheless seek to ensure that rival security software vendors, who have traditionally been the innovators in this area, are able to compete on a level playing field.\" She also ridiculed Microsoft's claims, backed by a consultant's report it sponsored, that Vista would create 100,000 jobs in six EU countries, including the UK. She said any new jobs would \"only be enhanced\" by the release of a version of Vista that allowed rival products to compete."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
