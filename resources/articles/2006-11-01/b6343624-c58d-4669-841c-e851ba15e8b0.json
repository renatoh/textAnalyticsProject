My view is that as they are going to be boiled for some length of time, any noxious residues will be taken care of; her view is that I am wrong. Do I need to eat humble pie? Johnny Hoskin A Yes, you might have to tuck into that pie. Boiling water will kill off most chemical residues, but your vegetables will be still be simmering away in a cocktail of water, fungicides and pesticides. Organic vegetables might need less washing. Having said that, tap water has its own yuck factor. Basically Johnny, they'll get us one way or another. Q I've just gathered a bumper harvest of chestnuts. I'd like to have a stash of them to use in savoury stews and soups throughout the winter, so what is the best way to store them? (I live in a flat and have no cool dry cellar or garden shed.) Can they be frozen? Tamsin Thorne A Dear Tamsin, chestnuts freeze very well. Boil them and remove the skins as usual, then pack them into bags, seal and freeze. You can add them to stews straight from the freezer. Q What is the best way to use up my basil before the frost gets it? I've got masses. Ed Murray A Ed, you might like to put some pesto down for the winter. Make it as usual and pack it into jars, covering the surface with a deep layer of olive oil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
