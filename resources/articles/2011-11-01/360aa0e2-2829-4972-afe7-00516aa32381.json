It is reckless to be adamant about the meaning of Fabio Capello's statement on Friday when his English can be accidentally enigmatic but he did sound as if he believed there was a key element missing from his squad. \"The difference between the good players at 30 years old and the 24 or 25, miss some players,\" Capello said. \"The new generation of these players will be really, really important.\" It does appear that he is intent on identifying footballers in their mid-20s and preparing them to thrive after he has gone. Capello is proud and since he is unlikely to win the 2012 European Championship the manager would surely wish to leave behind a promising yet seasoned group. He has already been known to go to extremes in the matter. Jordan Henderson, then a Sunderland player, made his debut in the friendly with France a year ago but is yet to collect his second cap despite the prominence that comes with a transfer to Liverpool. You might almost think that Capello had suffered from a bout of recklessness in turning to Henderson since the midfielder was then aged 20. Capello, in common with nearly all international managers, is a prisoner of circumstance. Exaggeration has become an obligation. To be more precise, he was selective in his enthusiastic appraisal of Phil Jones's vigorous breaks on the right during the Euro 2012 qualifier with Montenegro in Podgorica. No one should scold a manager for offering encouragement but Capello will have understood fully that Jones, 19, is still to amass knowhow about defending. The player's ideal position in the England side remains undecided and the emphasis this weekend would appear to rest on his employment against Spain as a defensive midfielder. Regardless of the fact that Jones speaks with a maturity that reflects his confidence, Capello directs attention to him because the manager is generally lacking individuals who are closing in on their peak days. There is a spell when a player can hope to revel in the balance he enjoys between verve and cunning. England lack people in that category. Capello seemed to have that on his mind when implying that there was a gap in the age profile of his squad. Few of the lineup he is expected to select against Spain come from the span of, say, 24 to 28. It is feasible that only Glen Johnson (27), James Milner (25) and Darren Bent (27), of the outfield players who start the match, will fit the bill. The element of reassurance lies in the knowledge that Capello has no inclination to pad out the side with old campaigners. Of the men who do fall into that category, Frank Lampard, 33, will appreciate already that he has to vindicate himself in match after match. The scepticism will not abate over the likelihood of a player at such an age continuing to succeed as a roving midfielder who can maintain the same scoring rate. Capello would rejoice if there was someone who looked ready to supplant Lampard, even if that sort of rivalry just gave the Chelsea player a touch more of an incentive to sustain his standards. Those players who will press their case for selection with true vigour are very familar. John Terry, although he may not even be a substitute against Spain, is virtually certain to face Sweden on Tuesday. The manager must also hope that a spell of fitness and durability comes over players who look vulnerable. It will be a challenge for Rio Ferdinand to show he can sustain the level of match fitness that would make him an automatic choice for the middle of the back four. By the same token, Capello would probably like to suppose that Steven Gerrard has a contribution to make, regardless of the fact that explosiveness cannot come so readily any more to the Liverpool midfielder who will find it hard to regain ideal condition. Capello can be heartened that Gerrard did, at least, reserve his single goal this season for Liverpool's draw with Manchester United. The trouble for England is that those players who should be coming into their best years have not given enough indication that they are about to overthrow their elders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
