The court of appeal will now have to consider whether to allow the UK Border Agency leave to challenge the decisions, adding to the legal confusion surrounding the singer's proposed UK tour. Yesterday the agency, which insists his presence in Britain would not be conducive to public order, said: \"We maintain that the immigration judge in the initial hearing made a material error in law. \"We will continue to oppose the entry to the UK of individuals where we believe there may be a risk to the public.\" It said there had been no change in the facts that led him to be denied a visa in the first place. Despite earlier US convictions, Snoop Dogg, 37 - whose real name is Cordozar Calvin Broadus - had previously been allowed into Britain. The legal arguments centred on his arrest following a fracas at Heathrow airport in 2006. In January, an immigration judge, Nehar Bird, found no evidence that the rapper had been responsible for any public disorder and ruled that the authorities had failed to show that his exclusion from Britain would be conducive to the public good. His request for a visa was initially rejected in March last year, the day before he was due to join fellow rapper P Diddy in Britain to speak to black teenagers at an event organised in response to shootings and killings of black boys in Manchester and London. \"The aim was to speak against the glamorising of firearms as a fashion accessory,\" the judge wrote in her ruling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
