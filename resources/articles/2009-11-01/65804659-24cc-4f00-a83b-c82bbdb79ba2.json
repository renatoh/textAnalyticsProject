This was an utterly authoritative performance, brutal and beautiful in equal measure. In short, it was majestic. For the French, routed by 27 points, it was a humbling evening, but then the All Blacks played so well that there was surely not a team on the planet who could have stayed with them. No doubt, New Zealand had come to Marseille looking for revenge. The 27-22 loss to France in Dunedin this summer was all the fuel they needed to fire their finest performance of the autumn. They wanted the Dave Gallaher Trophy back, and by the end of the first half they already had a firm grip on it. When the French won that Test in June, New Zealand had been missing Richie McCaw and Dan Carter. Their return was reason enough for the French to worry, but in truth the man who made the single biggest difference between the two sides \u2013 and who had also been missing from that match \u2013 was Sitiveni Sivivatu. On current form Sivivatu is the finest winger in the world by a margin as wide as the yawning gaps he sliced open in the French defence. He had a dazzling first half, scoring New Zealand's first try, and making their second, each with a rapier-sharp run down the left. His opening score came in the 10th minute. At New Zealand's first lineout in the French half, Andrew Hore threw long to Jerome Kaino. He snapped the ball down to Jimmy Cowan who sniped through a gap at the back of the line before offloading to the magnificent Ma'a Nonu. Though Nonu was hauled down three metres short, the ball was worked wide to Sivivatu. He made Vincent Clerc look as though he was wearing boots made of stone as he cut past him to the line. Later in the half, Sivivatu used his speed to burst clear of David Marty, who was left sprawling in his wake. A simple inside pass set up Mils Muliaina, and New Zealand had a 12-9 lead. Carter added a penalty moments later, and when New Zealand bundled over a five-metre scrum, their lead grew further. It would have been larger still if Cowan had been able to ground the ball after charging down a clearance from Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc. In reply all France could muster was a trio of penalties from Julien Dupuy and a sharp drop goal from Trinh-Duc. After the break, though, Dupuy's hitherto deadeye accuracy evaporated away. He pushed one penalty wide left, another wide right. Cowed, France seemed to shrivel up, retreating into their own territory and resigning themselves to trying to survive the onslaught. The All Blacks, sparked by Sivivatu's example in the first half, started to cut loose and, for the first time in a long time, played with dash and panache. Carter began to show off the breadth of his talent, adeptly mixing his play, chipping and chasing, sidestepping and sprinting, he shredded the French line time and again. Not to be outdone by Sivivatu, on the other wing Cory Jane created and finished New Zealand's fourth try after collecting his own kick-ahead. He had been presented with the ball by a careless kick from Damien Traille, who cleared in a panic after an attempted drop-goal from Carter rebounded off the crossbar. It seemed symptomatic of the collapse of France's spirit and shape as the match wore on. If New Zealand were gifted Jane's try, they had to work a little harder for their fifth. The ball was ripped out of a ruck in the left corner, and Conrad Smith bolted for the line before the cover could stop him. There was time enough too for another sizzling break from that man Sivivatu, though this one ended up a metre short. It was then that a fight broke out down in the left corner, the melee rolling over the touchline where, a little unwisely, one of New Zealand's support staff decided to get involved himself. Owen Franks was sin-binned in the fall out. The fracas showed nothing so much as France's frustration. They had been played off the park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
