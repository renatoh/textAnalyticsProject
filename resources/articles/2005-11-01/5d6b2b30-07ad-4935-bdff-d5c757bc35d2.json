Two of his club colleagues that year, Phil Booth and Andy Moore, were also found guilty by magistrates in Pau but the coach Richard Webster, who is now part of the Cardiff Blues management team, was acquitted. Moore was fined and, like Thomas, ordered to pay compensation worth \u00a31,900 to the two victims of the affray while Booth, accused by the prosecution of starting the incident, was given a six-month suspended jail sentence. Wales's coach Mike Ruddock said that Thomas's position as Wales captain was not in jeopardy. \"Gareth has been an exemplary captain and is an inspirational leader. His conduct on and off the field since I took over has been tremendous. He will continue to skipper the side.\" The 31-year old Thomas, who now plays for Toulouse, was not in court to hear the verdict which followed a four-hour hearing last month. Thomas, who is not playing for Wales against Fiji tonight because of an agreement to release players based in France and England back to their clubs, has, along with Booth and Moore, nine days in which to lodge an appeal. Fiji's hopes of exploiting any jitters Wales may have after last week's thrashing by New Zealand were dampened when they turned up at the Millennium Stadium yesterday and found the playing surface saturated following the decision to leave the roof open on Wednesday night. The Welsh Rugby Union blamed an inaccurate weather forecast by the Met Office who retorted that, had anyone inquired, rain would have been predicted. \"We talked about the roof with Wales this week and I am surprised that it was left open,\" said the Fiji coach Wayne Pivac.
