So much so, in fact, that the MPs said it should be stripped of its strategic advisory role. CCLRC's remit changed after its quinquennial review in 2001. It took on the dual role of operating Britain's own large research facilities and those we hold a stake in overseas; and of furnishing the government with strategic advice on the very same facilities (and their potential competitors). The remit is one fraught with potential conflicts of interest. The MPs found efforts by CCLRC management to separate the two roles had not gone far enough or restored confidence in the sector. They suggested its advisory role be transferred to Research Councils UK (RCUK), the body on which the chief executives of all the research councils sit. Likewise, the resources for this should also be transferred to RCUK. CCLRC management has split the two arms: operational and strategic. But John Wood, CCLRC's chief executive, sits on both the programme board and the strategy board. While the committee agreed with this approach - \"the two need to coordinate their plans\" - chairing both gives him \"an undue degree of influence and risks compromising the independence of both boards\". The strategy board should be chaired by someone outside the CCLRC, the MPs said. The committee's conclusions vindicated complaints made by those bidding to host the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Yorkshire. The MPs said CCLRC had not persuaded the sci entific community that it was prepared to throw its weight behind any bid that did not have a strong CCLRC element and damned its handling of the development of the bid for the ESS. But it wasn't all bad. CCLRC was praised for its work in maintaining world-class facilities and matching this standard in the provision of technical and other support services. Which leads on to the latest grants CCLRC is offering. The council is inviting expressions of interest under its facility development project grant scheme. The scheme is targeted at the continued development of CCLRC's large-scale research facilities: the ISIS spallation neutron source, the synchrotron radiation source and the central laser facility. And this second call has pots of money on offer - up to \u00a35m and no less than \u00a340,000. But proposals have to be timely and strategic, demonstrate developments that will benefit the wider research community and open up new research areas. There is a specific template to use. It and all the details are at CCLRC facility development. Interested researchers might want to get a wriggle on, though, as the deadline for expressions is July 26. Those deemed to be of sufficiently high quality and relevance to the CCLRC facility programme will be asked to submit a full proposal in September 2004. CCLRC expects to announce successful applications in February 2005. \u00b7Anthea Lipsett is senior reporter on Research Fortnight Let's hope this is the chance for the UK research community to put its differences aside and concentrate on building up the UK's top-quality large facilities research that CCLRC handles so expertly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
