Catherine Tate was Perrier-nominated last year as part of Lee Mack's sketch show. She now returns for her first headline show, playing five monstrous characters. The first, and weakest, is a camp old drag queen, boring his stagehand. The second is a glazed-over office girl discussing, in an absurdly protracted Essex squawk, what an \"absolute lunatic\" she is. Then come a randy nurse on the pull in the hospital waiting room (\"Oh, I've got a mind like a sieve - your mother passed away\"), a sozzled bride on her wedding day, and a foul-mouthed, unashamed grannie. The show is packed with choice one-liners rooted in strongly conceived character - Tate's ruthless geriatric describes an ugly baby as \"one eye looking at you, the other looking for you\". There may not be many belly laughs here, but Tate, a former RSC actress, shows a flair for convincing transformation as she morphs through ages, accents and headgear. Jonathan McGuinness, her stooge, supplies generously low-key support. In sketches that will inevitably invite comparisons with Victoria Wood, Tate celebrates rather than patronises her usually dimwitted dramatis personae. In two glorious instances, her vignettes demonstrate that behind every stereotype lurks a human being with a surprise in store. \u0095 Until August 27. Box office: 0131-556 6550.
