The Spaniard was aware of the owners\u2019 reputation for unceremonious sackings and he took over a struggling team in January 2018 after Marco Silva\u2019s spell unravelled. Gracia had failed to impress in his previous managerial post, at Rubin Kazan, and another failure might have significantly reduced his future options. Instead as his first full season at Watford draws towards its conclusion his side sit eighth in the Premier League, are preparing for Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Wolves, and Gracia\u2019s reputation has been burnished rather than blemished. \u201cI knew about it when I came here,\u201d Gracia said of the perception that the club had extremely limited patience with managers. \u201cI think to be a coach is always to have risks but you always have the confidence you will be able to do it well. That was my opinion in that moment, it was my decision, and I\u2019m very happy I came here.\u201d Gracia, having started the campaign among the favourites to be the first top-flight managerial casualty, last November became the first coach in the Pozzo family\u2019s seven-year ownership of the club to extend his contract, which now runs until the summer of 2022. \u201cI\u2019m happy because the club trusts me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people, the supporters and the players, all of them are enjoying and I am happy for that. People had different ideas about me in the beginning. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me happy. I am happy because I can feel all the people around me are enjoying the team. That is most important, not what some people say about you.\u201d Though an injury to Roberto Pereyra may stop Gracia from naming his first-choice XI, the manager\u2019s principal selection issue is whether to keep faith in Heurelho Gomes, the 38-year-old Brazilian who has played every cup game this season and will retire at the end of the campaign, or to replace him with Ben Foster, who has played every league match. \u201cMy opinion about Heurelho is that first of all he\u2019s an amazing person and after that he\u2019s a very good professional,\u201d Gracia said. \u201cI have to choose only one keeper. It\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s my job and I\u2019ll try to choose the player who will give us the best chance to win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
