But the Ballydoyle trainer is determined not to make a similar error in the potential re-match in Saturday's Tattersalls Millions Irish Champion Stakes, which promises to be one of the most exciting clashes of the season. Sea The Stars needs the rain to hold off if he is to take his chance, according to trainer John Oxx, but O'Brien is up for the challenge. O'Brien, while hoping that Sea The Stars is able to run and give the sport a showpiece to savour at Leopardstown, he also feels that it should perhaps be Fame And Glory who is going into the race with an unblemished record. Despite looking to have all bases covered at Epsom with six of the 12 runners, in the event the two O'Brien runners who set off at the head of affairs were largely ignored by the remainder of the field and Sea The Stars was able to use his considerable speed to best effect in the sprint to the finish. Fame And Glory, ridden by Seamus Heffernan, who turned into the straight behind the winner, was never quite able to land a blow and had to settle for second place. It is not a race that O'Brien will remember fondly. \"I should have seen what could have happened and I didn't,\" he said. \"It was my fault. What happened was that we were going to be ridden handy. But Mick [Kinane] was very tactically aware and he disengaged his group from the first two, from the horses up front, and Mick and Frankie [Dettori] controlled the race, which they were entitled to do. And what happened was that our main horses got caught behind. \"Mick is a world-class jockey. He took the gamble that the two horses who went off in front weren't good enough to beat him and he obviously had it in his head that his dangers were behind him and that if the fractions never changed he would win.\" O'Brien was quick to pay tribute to the winner on the day but he cut a dejected figure as he stood on the track after the race, watching replays of the race on the big screen in front of the Queen's Stand. \"What happened after the race? I went home. Maybe the reason why I was a bit ... confused after the race was that I still didn't know where our horses stood and where we were. Mick gave his horse a great a ride. A great jockey gave a great horse a great ride. But there were more questions to be answered after than before, do you understand? Sometimes when you get beat and you've made a mess of things it's often very hard to confront it head-on for a few days. But Epsom happened and that was it.\" Soft ground at the Curragh for the Irish Derby three weeks later meant that Sea The Stars missed the race in favour of a drop back down to a mile and a quarter in the Coral-Eclipse Stakes. That left Fame And Glory without much to beat, bar his own stablemates, but a five-length victory over Golden Sword at least proved that meeting with defeat at Epsom had left no lasting impression. Since then, in common with Mastercraftsman and a few of his most illustrious stablemates, he has been given what O'Brien refers to as a \"high-summer break\", a move which reflects the increasing slant of the international racing calendar towards big prizes at the end of the year such as the British and Irish Champion Stakes, the Breeders' Cup and other major meetings in Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. The decision perhaps reflects end-of-year disappointments in recent years where O'Brien-trained horses such as Dylan Thomas and Duke Of Marmalade have seemed to go off their game at the end of otherwise highly successful campaigns. \"There are such big races at the end of the season that we wanted to make sure that we got to the end,\" he said. \"We were hoping that Sea The Stars would come to the Curragh because we would know where we stood then. But hopefully we'll find out on Saturday. \"We're very happy with Fame And Glory and usually these real good mile-and-a-half horses have no problem with a mile-and-a- quarter and we always believed that he was a very good horse. He's all class and always has been. He's a real pro. He does what you want him to. He stays when you want him to stay. He gives when you want him to give. \"We know that John's horse is a great horse but we have a lot of confidence. May the best horse jump the ditch on the day.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
