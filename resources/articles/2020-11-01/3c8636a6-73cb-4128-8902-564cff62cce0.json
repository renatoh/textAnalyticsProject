The South African was unbeaten on 33 when she required medical assistance for an elevated heart rate during the Sixers\u2019 five-wicket defeat to the Perth Scorchers in Blacktown. She was taken by medical staff to hospital to undergo tests, but was able to return to the WBBL village at Sydney\u2019s Olympic Park the same night. The Sixers said on Thursday morning the 30-year-old was in good spirits and \u201cdoing really well\u201d. \u201cShe will participate in a team recovery and review session today while she awaits a report from cardiologists tomorrow,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cObviously her health is our No 1 priority and we will take whatever advice we need to from that review, but Marizanne and the club are hopeful she can play on Saturday.\u201d Kapp, who was forced to pull out of a clash mid-match earlier this year due to heart palpitations, left the Blacktown International Sportspark field after several minutes of treatment. She was also struck down by a mystery virus during the women\u2019s T20 World Cup earlier this year, forcing her to watch on from a hospital bed as South Africa lost to Australia in the semi-finals. Ellyse Perry scored an unbeaten 62 off 52 balls to help the Sixers reach 137-4 from their allotted overs. In reply, the Scorchers reached the victory target with five balls to spare. Perth opener Beth Mooney was the hero with an unbeaten 75 off 64 balls. The performance came just three days after she posted 60 off 44 balls in the Scorchers\u2019 36-run win over the Sixers. The pair of wins in Sydney helped the Scorchers rocket into fourth spot, now just two points adrift of the third-placed Sixers. Meanwhile, the Brisbane Heat gave their finals hopes a much-needed reboot with a crushing eight-wicket win over the Sydney Thunder. Heat spinner Amelia Kerr snared 4-20 from four overs in a sparkling effort to help restrict the Thunder to 111-9. In reply, Brisbane cruised to the victory target with eight wickets in hand and 21 balls to spare. Georgia Redmayne scored an unbeaten 59 off 45 balls to set up the successful run chase, while Georgia Voll (31no) was a strong support. Brisbane\u2019s second win of the season lifted them back to within two points of the fourth-placed Scorchers. The Thunder remain in second spot, but they are now three points adrift of the ladder-leading Stars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
