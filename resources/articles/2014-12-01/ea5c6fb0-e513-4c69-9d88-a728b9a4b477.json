However, Wenger maintains that the image of him as a miser was forced upon him by the years of austerity while the club paid for the construction of the Emirates Stadium but says he is now free of those shackles and ready and willing to plunge into next month\u2019s transfer market, as appropriate. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like is to spend money that I don\u2019t have,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have money so no problem spending it at all. What I fought against was spending money that would have put the future of the club in danger.\u201d Arsenal are known to be looking for a centre-back in January, with Laurent Koscielny still at least two weeks away from returning to fitness, and Wenger says that if the club identify a suitable replacement, an offer will be made \u201cwithout any doubt\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
