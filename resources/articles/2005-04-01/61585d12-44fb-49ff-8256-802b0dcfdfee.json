Suzanne Holdsworth, whose violent outburst remained unexplained during a 10-month police inquiry, was told by a judge that she would serve a minimum of 10 years. She denied attacking two-year-old Kyle Fisher, the son of a neighbour who had gone out clubbing, claiming that the child had suffered a fit and collapsed. But medical experts found that injuries to the boy's skull were as bad as if he had been thrown from a car travelling at 60mph. Holdsworth, 34, from Hartlepool, appeared for sentencing at Leeds crown court after a jury in Middlesbrough found her guilty of murder last month. The trial had heard that she was an experienced baby-sitter who had often helped neighbours, but something had snapped while she was looking after Kyle for his 19-year-old mother, Clare. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Grigson told Holdsworth: \"I accept that the incident was momentary and your actions were wholly unpremeditated. You are a woman of good character. \"You brought up two children on your own and you acted as a baby-sitter to other children prior to this tragic incident and in all that time you behaved in a wholly responsible way. \"Only you know what happened on the night that caused you to assault this young child, a child who apparently loved you and of whom you were fond.\" Holdsworth broke down in tears as the judge added that there was no doubt that Kyle's head had been beaten violently against the banisters. The toddler died from severe brain swelling at Newcastle general hospital two days after the attack. \"He was vulnerable and he was in your care,\" said the judge. \"But the evidence was clear that you must have rammed his head against the banisters.\" The jury was shown graphic photographs of bruising on the top of Kyle's head which clearly matched the banister joinery. Holdsworth continued weeping as she was taken down to start her sentence, while many of her family stood in the public gallery to show their support. There were gasps and sobs from them when the sentence was passed. Jeremy Richardson QC, for Holdsworth, told the court that the baby-sitter had no history of violence and was a loving mother of two with a large and supportive family. \"This was a one-off tragedy,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
