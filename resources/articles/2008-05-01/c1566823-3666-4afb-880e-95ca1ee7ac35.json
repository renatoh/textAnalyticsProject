Last night, Rangoon was virtually blacked out. The city's power station has been knocked out and there is little or no electricity. Pockets of light indicate hotels or the villas of those rich enough to own a generator and the fuel to run it. It is neon light for the rich, candle light for the poor. The price of basic commodities is rocketing: food, bottled water and petrol have doubled in just three days. Queues at the pumps stretch for three miles or more, with drivers waiting three or four hours to fill their tanks. Even some government ministry buildings have taken a battering and for all the military junta's talk of fighting back, there was no sign of aid arriving. Even the soldiers seem scarce. One foreign resident said: \"There are real concerns that the water may get contaminated. We could have a very serious outbreak of disease . I don't think people realise just how bad it is, and the government, for now, appears to not be doing anything.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
