Give them a second bundle of joy in the form of a Maclaren Volo buggy. Suitable for babies from six months, this has an ultra-light aluminium chassis. Intelligently designed, the buggy folds away easily and efficiently. Open and occupied, it runs smoothly, too, with four lockable swivel wheels. Sounds ideal. What makes it so commendable? When baby is not on board, it weighs just 3.8kg thanks to the lightweight frame, which is made from the same aluminium used for precision racing bikes. When the Volo travel buggy is folded, you can sling it over a shoulder thanks to the integral carry strap and almost forget that it is there. How much? The Volo sells for \u00a349.99 from Maclaren (01327 841300, maclarenbaby.co.uk)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
