You can create your own team or take over a struggling one, choose your drivers and then watch the races unfold across 17 international circuits. The absence of truly unpredictable weather deprives you of tougher tyre choices, but pit stops can still be a real test of race tactics. The trouble is, without licensed teams, cars and drivers, it's hard to feel attached to your team, no matter how well it performs.
