As it was, they lost 1-0, had a goal disallowed through VAR intervention and probably left Merseyside without realising J\u00fcrgen Klopp had become a fan of one of their best players. Jota will be lining up for the home side when the teams meet again on Sunday \u2013 or at least he will if Liverpool stick to the same starting lineup they used against Ajax in midweek. That would mean leaving the enormously talented Roberto Firmino on the bench once again, which many think a sensible compromise given Jota is already into double figures for goals this season. Others, including Klopp, would regret the omission of a player who frequently brings the best out of his teammates. With Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez long-term injured and Jota departed, Wolves lack goalscorers and will struggle to justify the confidence of anyone who backed them earlier in the season to end Liverpool\u2019s long unbeaten run at Anfield. Klopp, meanwhile, cheerfully admits to having created an area of uncertainty by adding an extra player to his already impressive front three. \u201cAt the moment the forward line is the only one of our lines where we have more players than we can use at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all the other parts of the team it is more of a question of choosing the players who can still walk, but we have no injuries at the front and so every week I have a tough decision.\u201d As everyone must know by now, Liverpool\u2019s injuries have piled up this season and Klopp is at a loss to understand why the five substitute precaution brought in to help deal with last season\u2019s hectic schedule during the pandemic has now been ditched, despite most Premier League managers believing it should be brought back. The Liverpool manager says the situation is going to get worse in the traditionally intense period between now and the new year, with every club playing every three or four days, and not just the ones involved in European competition. \u201cI\u2019m worried, like all coaches are worried, about player welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not just talking about fatigue and physical injury, but the toll this whole situation is taking on mental health. My players are under immense pressure at home as well as on the pitch. I know people will say they are well paid but they are still human beings in a difficult position.\u201d The presence of around 2,000 spectators on Sunday will hopefully be a sign that normality is beginning its recovery, a bit like Trent Alexander-Arnold on the training ground, though no one imagines that stadiums packed to capacity will be returning in a hurry. As a football romantic, as well as a Liverpool manager, Klopp misses the old atmosphere more than most. \u201cI love a full stadium, the noise, the energy, everything,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor me there\u2019s no other sporting event quite like a football match, nothing else can compare. \u201cWhen you know the sort of atmosphere a big crowd at Anfield can create you also know that 2,000 people is not going to be quite the same; that is not the sort of crowd that will be able to push us through a difficult game, for instance \u2013 we will have to do that by ourselves. But it will be nice to have people back and if this is the beginning of the end of empty stadiums it is certainly very welcome.\u201d The empty stadiums are a part of Liverpool\u2019s title win last season that Klopp will look back on without sentiment. \u201cEverything is more difficult without fans in the grounds,\u201d he said. \u201cWe coped very well with the change last season, but as footballers it is our job to cope. Our task is to deliver results and performances whatever the circumstances. \u201cSometimes you can encounter a hostile crowd at an away game and you have to ignore it and concentrate on playing your football. An empty ground is not quite the same thing, but it is another challenge that must be overcome. You have to create your own atmosphere, your own intensity. \u201cLast season the boys did it, this season it is still too early to tell. I don\u2019t think this is going to be a season for setting targets or breaking records. All the teams are just trying to get through it and play the best football they can, but it will be clear by Christmas that a big squad is going to be an important factor. \u201cPartly for that reason Chelsea are looking good at the moment, they can change their team unbelievably from one game to the next, but we can all worry about that later. This weekend we only have to worry about Wolves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
