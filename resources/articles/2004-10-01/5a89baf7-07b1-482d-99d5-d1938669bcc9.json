So how is Close Brothers Corporate Finance (CBCF) managing not just to retain its independent status but also to grab more than its fair share of some of the most high-profile restructurings around? The answer, says chief executive Richard Grainger, is simple: 'Everyone else is trying to cross-sell something. They come to us because they are fed up being seen as product fodder and having services rammed down their throats.' Part of the Close Brothers Group, it has three sister divisions - asset management, banking and the Winterfloods broking business - but you will never see CBCF advisers trying to flog the services of the other divisions, drumming up interest in a swaps deal or pushing out research just to stimulate deal flow. Grainger believes investment banking should be all about relationships. But, with deal flow down to little more than a trickle, nurturing those relationships is taking even more effort than usual. He says that the American 'bulge bracket' firms such as JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are sending idle staff to Britain in the hope of stimulating cross-border deals - and of stealing CBCF's core franchise of medium-sized clients. Grainger admits that some are tempted - retaining the services of Goldman Sachs gives chief executives plenty of boasting power in the golf club. But, he believes, they could end up so frustrated that the prestige name will lose its lustre. The senior director who wooed the business is likely to turn up only at the initial pitch for business or when the company is poised to do a big acquisition or similar deal; the rest of the time, it could be hard to find anyone to talk to sensibly about the business. 'In the big firms, you only get their attention when something is about to happen. If you just want strategic advice, you will not get their attention. And if another big deal [by another company] comes around the corner, the man you thought was your adviser will disappear. 'Ours are long-term relationships, broken occasionally by a transaction. We talk to people about their business, understand their history, strategy and management.' Why, if the independent route is so good, are banks such as Cazenove so keen to give it up? Grainger is characteristically frank in his assessment of the situation. Cazenove is primarily a broker to blue-chip companies, famously advising more than half the FTSE 100 index. But that offers only limited growth prospects, so it was trying to develop a mid-market financial advisory business but that, says Grainger, did not sit well with blue-chip broking. 'But JP Morgan [its proposed joint venture partner] is only interested in the blue- chips. What happens to the mid-market? That is a fantastic opportunity for us.' CBCF is clearly thriving by grabbing such opportunities. In the year to July, its profits more than doubled to \u00a39.8 million. Grainger believes its restructuring practice is the UK market leader, mainly acting for the bondholders. That arose because it pitched to Aegon and other investors who wanted to restructure the Drax power station, which was part of British Energy's portfolio. It won, and has since carved out a leading role in the energy industry, advising on the restructuring of 40 per cent of the industry last year and the current restructuring of British Energy. It is involved in the restructuring of Parmalat, the Italian food company that collapsed last year; it was a key player in the restructuring of hotel group Queen's Moat, one of the longest and most complicated of transactions. Outside the debt business, it is the retained adviser for more than 60 companies, including Austin Reed, Capita, LogicaCMG and Henlys Group. It has also developed an international network by forming relationship in countries such as France, Germany, Portugal and the US. The business is organised into six core industrial areas - engineering, business services, leisure and retail, technology, consumer foods and media. 'That goes back six years, when everyone was going down the sectoral route. We realised we needed to have sector expertise to pitch against the big integrated banks.' But, says Grainger, all staff are 'fungible' - not a disease, but an ability to move from division to division depending on where the work is. 'That means we end up with fantastic managers across all divisions.' He admits, however, that the market is 'fragile'. With so little business around, there is huge competition for mandates. But, with the optimism essential for an investment banker, he adds that it is a great time to do deals. 'It is a time for the brave, it needs people to take bold moves,' he said. 'They have to realise it is not an issue about their own share price but how they are doing relative to others. Now is a good time to consolidate for those who have the financial strength.' He points, as a good example, to the recent takeover of Linx Printing Technologies, one of its clients, which two US companies were fighting over. Much of the buying interest - and some of the selling - is from private equity companies that are flush with cash and anxious to spend it to prove to their investors that they can do deals. He believes that this competition means the industry is now prepared to do deals with much lower returns than before - a rate of return less than 20 per cent is now occasionally seen, while the golden rule used to be a minimum of 30 per cent. Hedge funds have also had a big impact on the business, if only because it makes it harder to work out what investors want. 'It used to be that half the business was in the hands of 16 institutions at most and you knew them all. Now, more than half of the shares can be in the hands of hedge funds and many do not have the analytic capacity to judge whether a bid is good, bad or indifferent.' Grainger joined Close when it acquired Hill Samuel from Lloyds in 1996 and was promoted to chief executive just under two years ago. He expects to be there for some time yet. 'I do not want to outstay my welcome - chief executives should not do that.' But, he adds, he loves it and cannot imagine doing anything else."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
