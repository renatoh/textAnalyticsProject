She even hired Hogg's cinematographer, Ed Rutherford. But this slight, conventional tale has nothing of Hogg's rigorous formalism or savage honesty. James Fox and Brenda Fricker play one of those middle-class English couples who've retired to France and act all proprietorial about the place even though, in Brenda's case, they barely speak the language. Their marriage has been becalmed by routine, so when Fox meets feline-featured Natalie Dormer, he offers, with a little too much chivalry, to show her and her jerk of a boyfriend (Paul Nicholls) around N\u00eemes. Rutherford does lovely things with the Proven\u00e7al light, but Fox is too much of a cipher to care about. There is one properly striking scene, however, involving Fricker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
