The schoolteacher supplied fake papers to Jewish people and others being rounded up by the Gestapo and sent them to hide at her older brother Georges\u2019 farm. She and her brother were arrested and sent to concentration camps, where Georges died. Lundy spent most of the rest of her life relating the horrors of Nazi Germany to schoolchildren and was made a grand officer of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur in 2017. Lundy, the youngest of seven brothers and sisters, was working as a teacher in a village near \u00c9pernay, where she also served as secretary to the mayor, when France was occupied. As a member of the local resistance network, codenamed Possum, she drew up false papers for Jews, escaped prisoners of war, Free French fighters parachuted into the region and those being sent to Germany as forced labourers. Lundy later described what she did as \u201chonest trickery\u201d. In June 1944, aged 28, the Gestapo arrested her while she was teaching a class. Lundy was interrogated and deported the next month. After being sent to a concentration camp in south-west Germany, she was then moved to Ravensbr\u00fcck, 50 miles (80km) north of Berlin, as prisoner number 47,360, one of 130,000 women and children held at the camp. Like all new arrivals at Ravensbr\u00fcck, she was forced to strip in front of SS officers. \u201cIt is another world: starving beings with emaciated bodies, hollow eyes, shaven heads, drag themselves along in rags. In a few days, we will look like them. We go to the search, we must leave all we have: jewellery, clothing, medicine, glasses, shoes. Then it\u2019s the shared shower in a huge shed and disinfection. Dressed in rags when there are no more striped outfits. We are unrecognisable with shorn hair,\u201d she later wrote. A few months later, Lundy was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp. Her sister Berthe was also imprisoned in Germany and her brother Lucien was held at Auschwitz; both survived the war. Georges died at Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1945. Returning to France after the war, Lundy was too \u201cdisorientated\u201d to speak about her experiences, but she began touring schools in 1959 to testify to the horrors of the concentration camps. In 2012, her book Le Fil de l\u2019Araign\u00e9e (The Spider\u2019s Thread) was published. Franck Leroy, the mayor of \u00c9pernay, said Lundy was \u201cthe grande dame\u201d of the town. \u201cEven if she didn\u2019t at all like us calling her this, it is what she was with her history as a resistant, as a deported person and her incredible contribution to public service and the duty of remembering,\u201d he said. \u201cShe also had a particular attitude about the war and particularly Franco-German reconciliation that she considered extremely important.\u201d Lundy was the inspiration for the character Mademoiselle Lisa Lundi in Tony Gatlif\u2019s 2009 French drama Korkoro, about Porajmos \u2013 the Romany Holocaust \u2013 in which a quarter of Europe\u2019s Roma people were killed. Asked on her 100th birthday what advice had guided her life, she replied: \u201cAlways ask: where are we going; with whom; what will we do? Everyone has a duty of responsibility, no matter how young.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
