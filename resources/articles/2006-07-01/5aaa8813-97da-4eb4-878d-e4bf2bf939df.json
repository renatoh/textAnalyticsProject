The man who launched the attack into Israel last week that captured two soldiers is widely regarded as a hero, however grim the destruction that Israel's retaliation has caused. \"Hizbullah is doing more for the Palestinian cause than any Arab government has ever done. When he says he will resist Israel, he does,\" said Muhammad Hassan, who runs a small barber's shop. \"We didn't know he had such technology - and especially the ability to hit an Israeli warship. It was a nice surprise.\" His enthusiasm for Hizbullah's leader is not blind or unquestioning. A customer nodded in support as Mr Hassan conceded: \"It's diverting attention from Gaza to Lebanon, and everyone's focusing on Lebanon now.\" After a pause, he added: \"I'm not sure whether Hizbullah should have waited but it has lessened Israel's pressure on Gaza. He may have wanted to give Gaza a breathing space.\" The customer chipped in: \"Now there are two fronts.\" Sabra and Shatila became headline news in 1982, when Israeli forces during an earlier invasion of Lebanon surrounded the camp and allowed Christian militias in to slaughter unarmed Palestinians. At least 700 people, perhaps as many as 3,500, were massacred, an atrocity for which an Israeli inquiry concluded that Ariel Sharon, then Israel's defence minister, bore \"personal responsibility\". About 400,000 Palestinians live in Lebanon, almost a 10th of the country's population. Although Israel's current onslaught has not specifically targeted any of the 12 camps registered by the UN relief agency, Palestinians have suffered as much as Lebanese. Most of the camps are in the south, three close to the stricken port of Tyre, two near Sidon and four in Beirut's southern suburbs, near the Shia areas Israel has pounded with a huge tonnage of bombs in the past week. In the narrow alleys of Shatila, most people are too poor to have anywhere to flee to. More than 700 go into the dusty basement of an unfinished school building every evening to shelter from the bombing. A few lightbulbs, strung from waterpipes, send dim rays through the gloom, illuminating mattresses and thin carpets on the concrete floor. Nohad, a volunteer for Najdeh, a women's rights NGO which works in the Palestinian camps, says there was much criticism of Hizbullah before the current crisis. \"But whatever people think of Hizbullah ideologically, it is weakening the enemy. It's showing the enemy is not as strong as it claims to be. Hizbullah is the only group which is doing something for Palestinians.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
