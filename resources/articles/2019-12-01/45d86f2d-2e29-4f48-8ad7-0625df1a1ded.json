The first shooting took place on Saturday morning in the city\u2019s Mission District, when police responded to reports of a burglary. The San Francisco police department said a police officer opened fire after the officer and his partner were attacked with an unnamed object by a person they were confronting in connection with the burglary. Witnesses told the San Francisco Chronicle the officers tried to revive the victim before he was taken to the hospital. Both the alleged burglar and one of the officers were admitted with unspecified injuries. The alleged burglar was in critical condition. Less than four hours later, about 60 miles from San Francisco, police officers in the city of Santa Rosa responded to multiple calls about \u201ca suspicious individual\u201d, according to a statement from the city\u2019s police department. An officer confronted the individual, who police say was \u201cun-compliant\u201d. The officer fired three rounds after the individual pulled out an item the officer believed to be a rifle. After chasing and tackling the individual, who was not shot, the officer realized that item was a black umbrella, not a firearm. Neither Santa Rosa nor San Francisco have released information about the races, genders and ages of the officers or other individuals involved. According to the hyperlocal news site Mission Local, whose reporters collected eyewitness accounts following the San Francisco shooting, the person who was shot there \u201cseemed intoxicated\u201d and officers used pepper spray before firing shots. The incident was the first police shooting of the year. In 2018, there were five police shootings. Police say they will hold a town hall meeting by 17 December to provide additional details on the incident. A San Francisco police commission spokesperson told the Guardian the department was awaiting the end of the investigation to give an official statement. San Francisco\u2019s freshly elected district attorney, Chesa Boudin, has vowed to review past police shooting cases once he takes over the office in January. According to Santa Rosa\u2019s most recent count, the last time a city police officer shot someone in the city was in 2017, during a home burglary. The police department says that the 7 December incident is being investigated by the police department\u2019s violent crime investigations team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
