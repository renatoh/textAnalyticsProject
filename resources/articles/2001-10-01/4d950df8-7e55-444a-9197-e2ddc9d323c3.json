The report, Zimbabwe: Time for International Action, stresses that political violence and farm invasions have continued and even increased, despite Mr Mugabe's promise at the Commonwealth meeting in Nigeria to restore the rule of law. \"It is time for the international community to raise pressure to the next level by instituting 'smart' sanctions against Mugabe and the Zanu-PF leadership and [by] providing direct aid to the opposition and civil society organisations,\" it says. \"The purpose of these measures is to encourage positive policy changes in Zimbabwe while time remains and to give encouragement to the people of that country who are working for such change.\" The ICG in Brussels says that limited sanctions should be imposed to prevent Mr Mu gabe fthinking he has free run to intensify repression because the international community is focused on Afghanistan. Its report calls for international travel sanctions and a freeze on the financial assets of Mr Mugabe and senior members of the government . It says sanctions will \"isolate Mugabe and bring further pressure to bear for positive change.\" It coincides with renewed political violence. Six members of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) opposition showed evidence of torture they say was carried out by supporters of Zanu-PF. MDC officials in the Gokwe area of central Zimbabwe showed feet severely swollen by beatings with iron bars. They said they were told it was the beginning of the presidential election campaign. Mr Mugabe is seeking a new term at the election, which must be held by the end of March. The ICG report says Zanu-PF is carrying intimidation to ensure that he wins."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
