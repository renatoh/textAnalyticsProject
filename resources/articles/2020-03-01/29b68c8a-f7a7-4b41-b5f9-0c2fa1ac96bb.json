England were leading 10-3 at half-time at the Principality Stadium but Dan Biggar was brought on as a replacement to inspire a Wales comeback before Warren Gatland\u2019s side went on to claim the grand slam. The defeat derailed England\u2019s bid for a clean sweep and Gatland could not resist a dig afterwards, questioning the ability of Jones\u2019s side to win when it \u201creally mattered\u201d. Jones has made two changes to the side that beat Ireland last time out, bringing in Anthony Watson and Mark Wilson for Jonathan Joseph and the injured Sam Underhill, and can boost their chances of claiming the Six Nations title with victory, assuming the postponed fixtures are rearranged. With Gatland no longer in charge, Wales are in transition and have followed victory over Italy with defeats by Ireland and France. Jones, however, is expecting another tight encounter, urging England to call on the painful memories of last year as added motivation. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember they beat us last year so we owe them one,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou never like to lose to Wales, and we lost last year. We were in the position we were in at half-time and we\u2019ve learned from that. That was one of the key games that got us in our best condition for the World Cup. It\u2019s still a game that I\u2019m sure every player who played in it, it irks them. It certainly irks me. \u201cEngland-Wales games are a little bit different, aren\u2019t they? They are tough affairs. It goes down to the wire. Particularly Wales under Warren have been one of the most physical teams in the world. We saw that in the World Cup when they ran South Africa close in that semi-final in a tough, physical game. \u201cSo they always bring that to the party and then [Wayne] Pivac\u2019s obviously trying to add a more passing attack game, but they\u2019ll still bring that physical quality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
