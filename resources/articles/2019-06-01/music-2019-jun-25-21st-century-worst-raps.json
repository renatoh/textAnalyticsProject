Edward Sheeran, who grew up in Framlingham in Sussex, gave his own take in the Live Lounge yet somehow the words \u201cat 56 a gram, five a hundred grams though\u201d didn\u2019t seem quite as authentic coming from him. Yeo Valley Boyz Yeo Valley During the years when the X Factor was enormously popular, brands began touting it as a \u201cBritish Super Bowl\u201d and launched desperately wacky campaigns during its ad breaks in the hope of briefly trending on Twitter. Into this thirst for hashtagability stepped four Barbour-clad Yeo Valley farmers \u201cspitting\u201d about how much they loved organic yoghurt. The ad contains many curdling moments but perhaps the sourest taste comes in the third verse when a female farmer tries to make a quick case for farming feminism: \u201cYou won\u2019t find milk maidens, that\u2019s no longer the deal, in my wax coat and boots, I\u2019m proper farmer Giles\u201d. Presumably, the dairy brand was unaware of the famous cockney rhyming slang \u2013 Farmer Giles: piles. Chance the Rapper v Backstreet Boys Dorito\u2019s Flaming Hot Nachos Superbowl ad Meanwhile, the actual Super Bowl remains a hotbed of terrible rap. Chance\u2019s verse here includes lines like \u201cfingers on my hot chips, red-handed come on man, now I\u2019ma need some chopsticks\u201d, although somehow he doesn\u2019t focus on the burning sensation when spicy nachos come out of the other side, even with the potential to rhyme \u201ctastebud cremation\u201d with \u201ccistern ruination\u201d. Macklemore Same Love Here he comes, presumably arriving in a second-hand shellsuit clutching a \u00a31 Full Monty VHS, attempting to write an LGBT rights anthem despite not himself being gay, opening the song by making it 100% clear how not gay he is, telling the story of when he told his mum that he thought he might be gay and she replied: \u201cYou\u2019ve loved girls since before Pre-K!\u201d. Got that, gays? He likes girls! Lady Sovereign Food Play Popular culture is constantly trying to convince us we want to shag our food, from salacious Flake adverts to Samantha covering herself in raw fish in the Sex and the City film. Perhaps the most unappetising attempt comes from this misguided album track by one-time Celebrity Big Brother contestant Lady Sov. Some choice lines include: \u201cDirty dishes in my sink I\u2019ll be your dirty missus ... crack open them Twiglets so we can munch them like piglets\u201d and, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to eat that burger so lets just rub it round your lips\u201d. Someone get a health inspector round to Sov\u2019s; this all sounds deeply unhygienic. McNulty from The Wire Guillemot Dominic Gerard Francis Eagleton West, educated at Eton and Guildhall, here, in a North Face puffa jacket, doing an SB:TV warm-up session. His intentions were honourable, helping to promote the short film Guillemot which was made by young people on the St Ann\u2019s Estate in Nottingham, but you can see on his face he\u2019s only doing it to be a mensch and somehow his lack of commitment to the role makes it worse, doing a kind of semi-street voice half the time but then getting nervous and dropping back into his whispered posho vowels. Catfish and the Bottlemen Black Skinhead Yes Kanye\u2019s post-industrial critique of black consumerism is good, but would it be better if it was being covered by floppy-fringed Miles Kane wannabees Catfish and the Bottlemen? What if it was mashed up with Kasabian and Black Keys songs, so the band could avoid repeating lines like \u201cStop all that coon shit, early morning cartoon shit\u201d? Now that\u2019s hip-hop. Utah Legislature rap It is always difficult to tell with these kinds of \u201cnormal people rapping\u201d videos whether there is a knowing sense that what they\u2019re making is so embarrassing it\u2019ll go viral. But in this track, where the Pillsbury Doughboys of the Utah senate try to explain how a bill gets passed by changing the lyrics to the theme from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, there\u2019s an added layer of incompetence; no effort has been made to time the raps with the backing track so you just get a loose collection of words and Comic Sans captions played near a karaoke beat. No one could mean to make something this bad. Gym Class Heroes Taxi Driver Oh cool, you\u2019ve written a rap song made entirely from the names of emo bands, well I suppose that counts as a poem, here\u2019s a gold star for your Year 7 English book. Oh, you\u2019re planning to release it as a single to be performed atop a whimpering emo guitar line of its own. Cool. Cool cool cool. Madonna American Life If you\u2019re going to continually reinvent your sound and image to remain relevant with contemporary trends, there are going to be some occasions where you get it really, really wrong. Here Madonna stands in front of what looks like a low-budget UN educational video of the flags of the world while she raps: \u201cI\u2019m drinkin\u2019 a soy latte, I get a double shot-e, it goes right through my body\u201d. Perhaps this is what inspired those Yeo Valley ad execs to put the dairy back into rap. Paul McCartney Meat Free Mondays This is only a few seconds long and yet somehow they are the worst few seconds on the entire internet. It starts innocently enough as a quick call to action from Macca to get people to sign up to his vegan mailing list, but as he runs out of things to say, Macca starts rapping the website URL to a clicked beat and then chucking in a bit of patois: \u201cYou can do it\u201d, and, \u201cRight now, please\u201d. Basically, it\u2019s the equivalent of Ringo showing up at his favourite takeaway and asking for \u201ca likkle bit of rice and pea, irie\u201d. Iggy Azalea freestyle Many have tried to transcribe what came out of Iggy Azalea\u2019s mouth at this fateful festival appearance. The best polyglots of the age have all come up with their interpretations, but roughly the verse went: \u201cFRICK CRAP RACK! BULLET TO THE POP POP POOM gonna do a rang, sitty can, no sicky tan, shorty do it in the armoire, no diggos in the motherfuckin\u2019 gnat.\u201d Whatever the exact wording, it felt like this was the moment Iggy went from being a major player in hip-hop to a malfunctioning Bop It that needed to be tossed out. Buck 22 ft Billy Ray Cyrus Achy Breaky 2 Billy Ray Cyrus is currently being celebrated for his feature on Old Town Road but his last country-rap crossover was decidedly lower budget. Teaming up with Buck 22 (us neither), he performed the chorus of his biggest hit while Buck made near continual reference to his daughter\u2019s sexual awakening, while in the video naked women styled to look like Miley twerk around the pair. What a parent. Big Narstie What\u2019s the Story Brixton Glory Big Narstie is a grime MC in much the same way that Neil Hamilton is a politician: it\u2019s not really a job as much as a job title that helps him make regular TV appearances. But Narstie\u2019s extensive back catalogue is as chequered as Hamilton\u2019s Hansard record, and this is a particular low ebb, an Oasis-sampling semi-sung nonsense about nothing in particular. Still, he\u2019s good on Would I Lie to You. Andy Murray Autograph Our tennis hero attempts his verse across some honky tonk piano and, just as in life, emoting is not his strong point. A song about the pains of signing tennis balls, Murray says his line \u2013 \u201cDuring Wimbledon, it really gets me crazy, my hand cramps up and my mind gets hazy\u201d \u2013 with the cold monotone of a president announcing nuclear war. Skepta All Over the House Skepta\u2019s career was wonderfully haphazard in the years before That\u2019s Not Me. He made an attempt at cracking the Turkish market with Oynama Sikidim Sikidim, and tried singing on 80s pastiche Lay Her Down, a song which included the lyric \u201cI just wanna be your Dev Hynes ... you can be my Jessie Ware\u201d. A step too far came with the video for this track, though, which was only available on porn sites and featured grotty and graphic scenes of real sex while Skeppy stood nearby rapping tales for his spank bank. That\u2019s not us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
