It will be some time before the exact causes are known, but it is clearly a tragedy that should not have happened. It comes only days after the annual report of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) pointed to a 50% increase last year in the number of railway employees killed at work. The railway industry sometimes seems to be a perpetual generator of bad news. However, this is not the case. One other finding of the HSE report, which received remarkably little publicity, was that in the year to March 31 2004 there were no deaths at all among passengers in train incidents. This is the first time for over 10 years that this has happened. Considering the enormous publicity given to accidents on the railways, it is only fair that this bit of good news should be emphasised. Deaths on the railways have a much bigger impact on the national psyche than road accidents, despite the fact that even in a bad year travel by rail is far safer than by road. During 1992 to 2001 an average of 0.4 passengers died on railways for every billion kilometres travelled. This compared with 3 deaths for cars, 57 for pedestrians and 109 for two-wheelers. The safest travel mode by far in terms of miles travelled was air. There was an average of only 0.01 deaths a year per billion passenger kilometres during that period."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
