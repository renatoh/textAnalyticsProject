It empowers us", "bodyText": "In April 2003, the year New Zealand\u2019s population hit 4 million, statisticians were predicting the country would hit at 4.8 million people in 2046. As in Europe and North America the country\u2019s birth rate was falling, and no one quite knew whether mass immigration would \u2013 or even could \u2013 continue at pace. Instead, the pressing concern at the time was how to reverse the brain drain. In the mid-2000s almost 40,000 New Zealanders were upping sticks each year. Miners and truck drivers were packing their bags for Queensland\u2019s mining boom. Bankers and lawyers were taking up plum jobs in London. Teachers, nurses, and other public servants were comparing what they made in Wellington with what they might make in Washington or Ottawa. And in that very brief moment it felt as if New Zealand was topping out. In 2008, the aspiring prime minister John Key took a camera crew to the capital city\u2019s 35,000-seat stadium to illustrate just how big mass emigration was. The implication? We were, to repurpose a dangerous phrase, sending our best \u2013 to the US and beyond. But the consensus among the commentariat was that Key\u2019s stadium stunt was just that \u2013 a stunt \u2013 and even if he and his party came to power there was precious little they could do to reverse what was the natural order of things: a stronger Australian economy, its gravitational pull drawing in more and more New Zealanders. Of course the commentators were right. The Australian economy remains stronger on most measures, and mass emigration was still a problem in the Key government\u2019s early years. But one thing no one was anticipating was just how quickly the government would compensate for the brain drain with mass immigration. In 2017, the Key government\u2019s final year in power, net migration (the difference between those coming in or immigrating, including returning New Zealanders, and those going out or emigrating) was at a record 72,300. In 2015, net migration was at 58,000 and in 2013 it was a little shy of 50,000. These are small numbers for countries such as Australia or the UK, sure, but for this country it was momentous. In the 20 years to 2014, average net migration to New Zealand was only 13,300. And this year the country will reach another population landmark: 5 million people. It took more than 20 years to grow from 2 million to 3 million. It took 30 years for it to grow from 3 to 4 million. It took only 16 years to reach 5 million. And we are, because of that growth, a country transformed. Population growth and the capital that comes with it are transforming the Auckland skyline. Tradespeople from Asia, the Philippines especially, are in good part responsible for rebuilding Christchurch after the devastating earthquake in 2011. Tourism and dairy, New Zealand\u2019s leading export industries, are thriving off the back of migrant labour. You can spot the transformation in schools, workplaces and universities, and the streets as well. M\u0101ori make up 16.5% of the population, up from 15% in 2013. We\u2019re present in every part of the country\u2019s private and public life, and in a way that was unthinkable half a century ago. M\u0101ori make up 23% of MPs \u2013 a disproportionate share \u2013 and M\u0101ori lead or co-lead every sitting parliamentary party, bar Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Labour. It\u2019s fashionable to imagine New Zealand as a 1950s Britain \u2013 the temperate climate, a buttoned-down national character, and the things that were best about Britain like a cradle-to-grave welfare system \u2013 but in reality this is a M\u0101ori country. For a very brief moment in the 80s that fact was at the heart of New Zealand\u2019s constitution. The government understood the country as \u201cbicultural\u201d. Two peoples were in partnership, M\u0101ori and the European settlers who came after, and we\u2019d run the show as equals. Sure, there was a gap \u2013 sometimes even a chasm \u2013 between promise and practice, but the aspiration was there. The problem, though, is mass immigration from the 90s onwards quickly made biculturalism unworkable. In 2019, Asian peoples make up 15% of the population and Pacific peoples another 8%. In this new country only one kind of culturalism works: multi. For people who oppose M\u0101ori reasserting their claim on political powerthis is great news. M\u0101ori are just one minority among many, the opponents insist, claiming they\u2019re not even indigenous. But for the small number of M\u0101ori who tie their political claims to their demographic power it\u2019s quite terrible. On current trends Asian peoples will overtake M\u0101ori as the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand. This is an \u201cethnic-cultural tension point\u201d, as the country\u2019s leading demographer put it, confirming that in every settler colony, population politics is toxic. Except when it isn\u2019t. The truth is immigration isn\u2019t diminishing M\u0101ori claims on political power. It\u2019s strengthening those claims, pushing each one forward. At Ihum\u0101taohundreds of land protectors are occupying the historic site and reclaiming it for the local tribes. Among the occupiers are groups such as \u201cAsians for Tino Rangatiratanga\u201d meaning Asians for M\u0101ori political power. Visitors to the land and supporters of the occupation include west African Islamic scholars, Cook Islands royalty, and indigenous Taiwanese people. This is what sets New Zealand apart \u2013 and maybe above \u2013 other countries in the Anglosphere. M\u0101ori rights aren\u2019t contingent on their status as a (growing) minority. Population power doesn\u2019t secure our rights. The Treaty of Waitangi does. The country\u2019s founding document reaffirms M\u0101ori political power (in the treaty\u2019s own words it reaffirms our \u201ctino rangatiratanga\u201d). And equally so the treaty protects migrants, guaranteeing that New Zealand is their place to stand as well. The only thing the treaty expects of them is to recognise and respect M\u0101ori political power. The bargain is that simple and, if Ihum\u0101tao is any guide, it\u2019s one that migrants are more than willing to make. This is the reason I\u2019m so happy about New Zealand at 5 million.
