The Portugal playmaker volleyed his latest majestic strike into the top corner from 30 yards as Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s team moved to within one result of a return to the Premier League. Wolves will seal promotion if they beat Birmingham at home on Sunday lunchtime, or the evening before should Fulham falter against Brentford. Moving on to 92 points, they have already gained their record haul at this level and, 11 points clear, could also be anointed champions on Sunday. Derby\u2019s promotion plans have for some time been restricted to holding on to their play-off berth and, even after successive victories before Wednesday night, they are not bankers in fifth place. Neves converted a brilliant free-kick to secure victory at Cardiff last Friday and has scored six long-range goals this season. Signed for \u00a315.6m from Porto last summer, the 21-year-old midfielder has lived up to his billing and Gary Rowett believes he belongs not only in the Premier League but at the top end of it. \u201cThat\u2019s almost the first time I\u2019ve applauded an opposition goal,\u201d the Derby manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s Champions League stuff, not just Championship. He\u2019s a Champions League player. That\u2019s what you get when you spend nearly \u00a316m. At 21, when you play with that much control \u2026 For me, he should be playing for one of the top-four clubs in the country. They\u2019re like a Premier League side but our season\u2019s not going to be defined by games against Wolves.\u201d Wolves\u2019 home form has been almost serenely consistent all season. They have lost once in 21 league matches at Molineux and will be relishing Sunday\u2019s derby. \u201cWe are close,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cWe have to play on Sunday. Nothing changes, nothing changes. We have to prepare well. The game on Sunday means a lot to our fans, to us. We have to be very cautious. \u201cI was very pleased. We are fortunate to have this talent [Neves]. We still have a long way to go and R\u00faben knows he has a lot to work on and improve. Now I\u2019m boring because I\u2019ll go home and you know what I\u2019m going to do? Watch the game again.\u201d Wolves set about Derby with panache and were ahead within six minutes. Diogo Jota timed his run perfectly to latch on to Willy Boly\u2019s angled lofted pass and get beyond the backline. Even then he had his back to goal but the Portuguese winger took the ball down with one touch, turned and calmly lifted it over Scott Carson. Neves dispatched two wonderful strikes that Carson could only parry during the first half but there was no stopping the goal that arrived on the day Wolves closed the voting for their goal of the season competition. When Barry Douglas\u2019s corner was cleared by Chris Baird, Neves appeared to miscontrol the ball for a moment. But perhaps he was just teeing himself up. For his next touch was a right-foot volley from 30 yards that flew into the top corner. It was a remarkable goal from a remarkable player."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
