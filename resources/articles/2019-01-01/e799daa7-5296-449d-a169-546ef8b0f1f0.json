Speaking on Saturday at a coffee shop in Ames, Iowa, a college town of nearly 70,000 about half an hour north of Des Moines, the New York senator acknowledged that she does not have the same national name recognition as some other 2020 hopefuls, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren who visited the state this month. But, she told a crowd on a frigid morning, she thinks she is the best candidate to help \u201creclaim our democracy\u201d from Trump and corporate interests. \u201cI\u2019m going to run for president because I really believe that I will fight for your children as hard as I fight for my own,\u201d Gillibrand said in an impassioned address. \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d Gillibrand told the crowd, which included a number of students from Iowa State University, the American dream has been \u201clost\u201d because of \u201ccorruption in Washington\u201d. \u201cWe no longer have a direct democracy,\u201d Gillibrand said, promising to confront the \u201csystems of power in this country that control everything\u201d as well as the \u201ccomplicit politicians\u201d who represent special interests, not constituents. \u201cWe the people have to take back this democracy,\u201d the senator said. \u201cWe the people have to fight for it. \u201c[The government] you have today is not good enough.\u201d Gillibrand made little direct reference to Trump in her initial eight-minute pitch. But she railed against him during a 20-minute question-and-answer session that touched on issues including gun control, climate change, education, foreign policy and the increasingly conservative judiciary. Trump, she said in some of her most spirited comments, has \u201ctaken on the tenets of our democracy\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s literally trying to unwind the basic structure of what keeps this country strong,\u201d she said. Her remarks appeared to resonate with many attendees, including Rob Bingham, a senior studying political science and public relations at ISU. He said he had seen Warren and John Delaney, the Maryland Democrat who retired from the House of Representatives to campaign for president, in the early going of the 2020 campaign, but that Gillibrand stood out. \u201cThere\u2019s something about Gillibrand that feels authentic and raw,\u201d Bingham said. \u201cYou see that in very few candidates.\u201d The 52-year-old announced her run on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday. She has served in the Senate since 2009, when she took over the seat her mentor, Hillary Clinton, gave up to serve as Barack Obama\u2019s first secretary of state. Her national profile has risen in the #MeToo era. She was the first senator to call on fellow Democrat Al Franken to resign his Senate seat amid sexual misconduct allegations in 2017. That same year she remarked that Bill Clinton should have been forced to resign over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. She has also called for Trump to resign over his sexual assault allegations. In Ames, she appeared to allude to her calls for Franken\u2019s ouster, which has led to criticism and sexist attacks. \u201cI have never backed down from a fight,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s inconvenient. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not politically expedient. If it\u2019s the right thing to do, I will do it.\u201d Gillibrand has emerged as one of the leading progressives in the Senate, becoming the first senator to call for the elimination of Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Ice, the agency that has been central to the enforcement of Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies and which many in the Democratic party\u2019s progressive wing want to abolish. Some, however, have raised questions about her liberal bona fides, given some of the more conservative positions she has taken in the past on issues including immigration and gun control. \u201cShe\u2019s evolved on so many issues,\u201d said Dylan Meyer, an ISU senior who has followed Gillibrand\u2019s career since she entered the Senate. \u201cTime will tell [what she really believes].\u201d The senator\u2019s most immediate challenge will be to build the kind of name recognition she will need to stand out in what\u2019s expected to be a crowded field \u2013 especially if heavy-hitters like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders jump in. Strong early appearances in Iowa, which holds the first contest of the Democratic primary in February 2020, will be essential to proving to voters here that \u201cshe has the chops to be a serious candidate for the Democratic nomination\u201d, Joe Shanahan, a veteran Democratic strategist in Des Moines, told the Guardian in an email. Gillibrand\u2019s Iowa schedule also included visits to Sioux City, Boone and Des Moines, where she spoke at the Women\u2019s March on Saturday afternoon. Many in the crowd in Ames who spoke to the Guardian said they went into the event not knowing a huge amount about the New York Democrat, but liked what they heard. \u201cI really like her style,\u201d said Tom Emmerson, a resident of Ames. \u201cIt looks like she\u2019s speaking from the heart.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with her,\u201d said his wife, Linda Emmerson. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good start.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
