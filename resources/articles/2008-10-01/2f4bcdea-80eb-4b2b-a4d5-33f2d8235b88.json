Uplifting though the backdrop provided by the glinting brown waters of the Humber Estuary may be, Mick Newell made it clear yesterday that taking over at Grimsby Town represents a tough road back for a young manager formerly considered among the most promising in the country. That, of course, was before January 2006, when he chose to go public on what he considered to be the pernicious financial influence of agents within the game, and followed up by criticising the regime running his then club, Luton Town, so explicitly as to make his sacking inevitable. Since then the Football Association has launched an ineffectual corruption enquiry, Luton have been deducted 30 points, and Newell's telephone - which other clubs rang regularly when he was steering the Hatters towards the top end of the Championship - has been quiet. Until last week, when Grimsby got in touch. \"The attraction of coming here was they called me at the right time, simple as that,\" admitted Newell, after taking his first full training session at the club yesterday. \"I was as flattered as if Derby, Leicester, Preston, or Ipswich - who all contacted me when I was at Luton - had approached me.\" There were discussions with potential employers soon after he left Kenilworth Road too, but Newell insisted he was so disillusioned with the reaction to his revelations - or lack of it - he was far from sure he wanted anything to do with the game again. \"For a year after I left Luton, I could take or leave football. I spoke to people at decent clubs, very good properly run clubs, and for whatever reason I wasn't offered the job, but that's probably a good thing, because I didn't have any enthusiasm and hunger. \"Now I feel totally fresh. I don't have any ego issues about taking on a club at the bottom of League Two, because this a club with history and far more potential than a lot of clubs, so I was as pleased to hear from them as I could have been. It was what I needed to reignite my enthusiasm.\" It is, he acknowledged, good to be working with footballers again, despite the fact the Mariners have not won in 21 league games, and would be bottom of the Football League were it not for points deductions imposed on Rotherham, Bournemouth, and, of course, Luton. Dauntingly, his first game in charge is against top of the table Wycombe Wanderers tomorrow - but Newell insisted he wouldn't have it any other way. \"I'm not the type of manager who paints a bleak picture when they take over at a club, so that any success makes them look like a miracle worker. There is plenty to work with here, and if you start scoring goals and winning games it's surprising how quickly people forget you have a weakness here or there. \"Having the league leaders first up is ideal because there is no pressure on us. I've told the players to go out and play with the enthusiasm and desire they've shown me in training, and there's no telling what they're capable of.\" And if he can turn Grimsby around, he smiles, perhaps people will start remembering what he does best. \"Look, there's no doubt if I had my time again I would be at a bigger club, instead of digging my heels in at Luton. There will also be a day I can reveal the full facts about what happened there, and I will do, but now I want to look forward and concentrate. The people here are giving me an opportunity to do that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
