A friend introduced me to it. It was different to anything I had expected. What kind of work are you doing? I am working for a youth project at Victim Support, Croydon, called R U OK? We emotionally support and help young victims of crime and their families. We do everything, from taking referrals from the police and helping victims of serious bullying to personal-safety talks. What do you get from it? Satisfaction knowing that we can make a difference in people's lives, by giving them reassurance, non-judgmental advice and an overall knowledge that someone cares. How long have you been volunteering? Nearly two years. Will you continue doing it? I hope to always work for young people, but whether it will be with Victim Support I'm not sure. Has anything surprised you about volunteering with Victim Support? It is such a huge charity, but it is so humble. Its eye is on the prize of helping people, and there is no hidden motive. How should younger people become involved with Victim Support? Tell your local Victim Support what you want in your area, get involved and, if you can, volunteer. What aspect of the experience has most impressed you? How resilient young people are. They are not always the yobbish stereotype. Has volunteering helped with planning your future? Absolutely. It can show where your strengths lie, teach you new talents, and open up so many possibilities. What do you do in your spare time when you are not volunteering? I am also an actor. I try to divide my time between acting and working with young people. What book are your reading? My Bible. I borrow books, read one chapter, and give up. But my Bible goes everywhere with me. If you could change one thing about Britain, what would it be? That schools take bullying seriously."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
