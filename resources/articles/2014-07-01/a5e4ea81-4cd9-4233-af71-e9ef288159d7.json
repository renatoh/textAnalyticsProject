And we see the Chunnel as a one-way tunnel, pouring shuttle-loads of Britons to our shores to enjoy our unique landscapes and drink our peerless wines. We also cross the Channel at times, but almost exclusively to go to London, which has become, some say, the sixth largest French city in the world, with some 300,000 French residents. But while Britons flock to P\u00e9rigord, Brittany and Provence, we tend to overlook the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales. For millions of television viewers back home, the images displayed during a long weekend of cycling were a revelation. Why opt for Tuscany, Costa Brava, Greece or Turkey with such gorgeous landscapes so close at hand? Our Yorkshire hosts even booked a little bit of sunshine after a more typical rainy spell the previous day. The beauty of l'Angleterre profonde, to use the expression we apply to our own hinterland, has mostly been a well-kept secret, perhaps because the Tunnel has yet to entirely bridge the cultural gap between our two countries. Yorkshire remains a word we cannot pronounce and mostly apply to a breed of small dogs favoured by old ladies. The Tour de France has in recent years contributed to making Britain a little less of an island. Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome conquered the greatest cycling race on Earth two years in succession and it became hard to overlook an obvious reality: Britain has become a bike-crazy country. And the phenomenon is far more spectacular than we thought. This writer was lucky enough to be part of the Tour caravan's two previous British incursions: in 1994 to coincide with the opening of the Tunnel, and in 2007 for a glorious Grand D\u00e9part in London. The first time, even though Chris Boardman and Sean Yates held the yellow jersey for a few days, English crowds watched the peloton ride past their homes with an amused, sometimes bemused, look on their faces.The Tour was then nothing more but an exotic attraction. In 2007, the passion for cycling was already spreading, but nobody would have believed that two local riders could take the yellow jersey to Paris within six years. The huge crowds lining the streets of the picturesque little towns of Yorkshire yesterday, some wearing Mark Cavendish masks, most clad in yellow or polka-dot, were proof of the mutation. Cycling is now a household sport and Britons know almost as much about the Tour as we do. Perhaps even a little more. At least they know how to win it, something we have not been able to do for 30 years. It seemed as though the whole of Yorkshire had left their homes to form a guard of honour to the peloton. Entire villages had used their best French to write banners cheering \"Le Tour\", while union jacks and tricolores were flying proudly side by side in the light breeze. Dave Brailsford, the man responsible for the extraordinary wave of success for British cycling in recent years, had a broad smile on his face at the start in Leeds. \"Bienvenue en Angleterre,\" he told me as I walked past. For some strange reason, it rang to my ears oddly like the Euro 1996 slogan \"Football's coming home\". Will cycling really be coming home on Tuesday when the Tour heads back to France? I am not so sure any more. Francois Thomazeau is a French sports journalist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
