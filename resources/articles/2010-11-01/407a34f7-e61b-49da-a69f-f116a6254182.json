Harry Redknapp does not like Howard Webb and the Tottenham Hotspur manager likes him even less after he watched him deny his team what looked like a clear penalty with the score at 0-0 in the second-half. Worse, the referee chose to book David Bentley for a dive. Redknapp has complained that Webb has made dreadful decisions against his team on a handful of previous occasions and his mood darkened when the Yorkshire official chose only to book Lee Cattermole, the Sunderland captain, for a dangerous tackle on Luka Modric with the score at 1-1. Cattermole's initial contact in the 69th minute was with the ball but his challenge was high and aggressive. Modric was fortunate to be able to carry on. Cattermole's life feels charmed. He got away with a goalline handball in the victory over Stoke City on Saturday. Redknapp's ire could also be directed at his defenders. After Rafael van der Vaart had given his team the lead with his seventh goal in six White Hart Lane appearances \u2013 the Dutchman always scores here \u2013 Tottenham's centre-halves William Gallas and Younes Kaboul got themselves into an embarrassing tangle and suddenly there was Asamoah Gyan tiptoeing clean through to smash and grab for Sunderland. It was the all-singing, all-dancing \u00a313m summer signing's fifth goal for the club. Darren Bent, who missed out here through injury, has eight. Remarkably, they are the only Sunderland players to have scored this season. Tottenham had enjoyed the better of the possession and the chances \u2013 they encountered Craig Gordon, on his first appearance of the season, in fine form \u2013 and, for Redknapp, it felt like two points dropped. The final insult for him came when he heard boos from the home crowd at full-time. In the previous fixture here last Tuesday, Tottenham had beaten Internazionale, the European champions. \"Well, they've had it so good here over the years, you see,\" Redknapp said, sarcastically. \"When you keep winning league championships every year, you get upset when you don't win. It's hard.\" Redknapp refused to single out Webb for personal criticism, even if he might have wanted to. Webb's recent rap-sheet, in Tottenham eyes, includes the award of a controversial penalty for Manchester United against them and the denial of one in their favour at Chelsea. Redknapp, though, could not conceal his frustration at what he felt were two key decisions that Webb called incorrectly. \"It was a blatant penalty,\" Redknapp said, \"and how can you book Bentley. If you get the penalty, it can make a big difference. As for Cattermole's tackle, it was a bad one. It could have broken Modric's leg easily. It was a red card. The referee has to understand the difference between going over the top of the ball and playing the ball.\" Bruce, for whom this result ended a run of 10 successive defeats in London, said that he had not seen the penalty flashpoint but he spoke up in defence of Cattermole. \"I thought it was a fair tackle,\" he said. \"For me, he played the ball but when you go to ground, you take the man as well.\" Tottenham dominated the first half and Gordon had to save smartly from Modric, Van der Vaart and Bentley. When he was beaten by Tom Huddlestone's sumptuous first-time drive, he was bailed out by the crossbar. Bruce sent on Danny Welbeck at half-time and he rejigged to 4-4-2 yet Tottenham remained on the front foot, with Van der Vaart going close with a series of headers. Then came the penalty uproar. Perhaps what worked against Bentley, when Bolo Zenden jumped in rashly, was he seemed to begin his tumble before the contact. But there was no doubt Zenden got Bentley and, also, that he did not get the ball. When Webb pulled back the play to caution Bentley, White Hart Lane howled. The decision was forgotten when Tottenham went ahead, and it ought to be noted that Webb played a good advantage when Zenden fouled Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto. The ball was moved wide to Gareth Bale and his high cross was headed back by the substitute Peter Crouch for Van der Vaart to control, spin and finish. Bruce complained that the midfielder had handled before he shot low into the net. \"Maybe Webb was being kind to the Dutchman,\" he joked, an ironic reference to the referee's handling of the World Cup final. Tottenham's defensive blunder, though, ensured that Webb moved back to the top of the post-match agenda."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
