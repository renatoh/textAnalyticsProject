The three-man Adjudication Panel for England said the mayor of London should step down from his duties on March 1. They ruled that his outburst last February had breached the Greater London authority code and damaged the reputation of his office. His treatment of Oliver Finegold, a reporter for the London Evening Standard, was \"unnecessarily insensitive and offensive\", the panel said. Mr Livingstone had asked the reporter if he was a German war criminal and then, after learning that he was Jewish and had been offended by the question, compared him to a concentration camp guard. The panel rejected Mr Livingstone's argument that there was a difference between the damage he might have caused to his own reputation and the effect of his actions on his office. In deciding on a suspension, the panel rejected the alternative sanctions of a censure or an order for Mr Livingstone to undergo training. The panel's chairman, David Laverick, said it would not have been appropriate to have disqualified Mr Livingstone from office. \"The case tribunal is, however, concerned that the mayor does seem to have failed from the outset of this case to have appreciated that his conduct was unacceptable, a breach of the code and did damage to the reputation of his office,\" he said. \"His representative was quite right in saying that matters should not have got as far as this, but it is the mayor who must take responsibility for that. \"It was his comments that started the matter and thereafter his position seems to have become ever more entrenched. \"The case tribunal considers that the appropriate sanction is for the mayor to be suspended for a period of four weeks from March 1.\" Mr Livingstone is entitled to appeal against the ruling by making an application to the high court. He will make his last public appearance before his suspension on LBC's People's Question Time, to be broadcast next Wednesday evening. Commenting on the ruling, the London Evening Standard editor, Veronica Wadley, renewed calls for the mayor to apologise for his remarks. \"There is no question that he caused offence to many Londoners by his comments, and his stubborn refusal to say sorry aggravated the position,\" she said. \"Mr Livingstone not only offended London's Jewish community but then he did not show the stature expected of the mayor of London by apologising. As the Standards Board found, our reporter questioned Mr Livingstone in a 'civil tone'. \"This paper has not always seen eye to eye with Mr Livingstone but we supported him in his re-election to be mayor and, in particular, applauded his work in helping to unite London after 7/7. We believe, though, that it is only right that the adjudication panel has now decided that Mr Livingstone acted in a manner that was ill-fitting for the mayor of this great city. Mr Livingstone should now apologise to those he offended.\" The complaint against Mr Livingstone was brought by the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Jewish groups today sought to draw a line under the controversy, expressing regret that the row had had to be settled by a tribunal. Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: \"It is unfortunate that it had to come to this ... People in positions of responsibility and power have to be particularly sensitive in terms of the language they use. No one wanted it to escalate or lead to this process.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
