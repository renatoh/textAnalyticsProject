The 27-point win required by Wales to take the title from England was never threatened. In the end, the salient margin became the 10-point win needed by France to leap-frog Wales into second. They made it easily in the second half, but this was a game neither side will be proud of. After the week he has had, Marc Li\u00e8vremont will be grateful for the win. He should be safe now till the World Cup. But Wales came with \u2013 or rather without \u2013 a coaching problem of their own. Shaun Edwards did not travel with the side. Rumours were flying round about an altercation between him and another member of Wales's back-room staff the night of the win over Ireland last week. It was sufficiently violent for him to be disciplined, and neither he nor his colleague made the trip. Warren Gatland repeatedly refused to comment on what he called \"an internal matter, full stop\". It is not untypical of Wales to fall back down to earth in disarray, just as they seemed to be taking flight. No one was ever getting carried away with the mini-renaissance of three consecutive wins that had formed the platform of their unlikely tilt at the title. They started well enough, though, but it was not long before they collapsed. The Edwards affair may well have got to them. Indeed, we spent much of the first half waiting to see whether either of these two would lose their rag and implode. France seemed the more likely for much of the opening period. Then there was a mini-turning point in the sixteenth minute, when Sam Warburton, who had looked as excellent as he has been all championship, left the field with a knee injury. But it was the unlikely figure of Lionel Nallet, the lock forward, who finally broke the game open with a try either side of half-time. Wales's challenge was doomed then, but we knew pretty early that there would be nothing to see here. Both sides were lax in contact, the French in the moment of the tackle, the Welsh more so in those moments after it, unable to clear the ball from the rucks with any authority amid the endless jostling. That proved particularly costly for them as the first half ticked down to its conclusion. Lee Byrne kept in play a half-hearted French kick to nothing \u2013 one of quite a few that the vigorous Welsh defence had forced them into \u2013 but at the subsequent ruck Wales's outside backs were smithereened by the ugly French forwards who happened to be nearby. Nallet, as large and hairy as any of them, ploughed straight through the middle, gathered the ball and carried on. A gallop of a good 30 metres, the hint of a dummy, and he was through one last forlorn Welsh defender for the game's first try. It need not have been so. Wales had had a few chances of their own. They scored the game's first points pretty much straight from the kick-off, working their way with focus down the right, deep into the French 22, before the referee called them back rather prematurely for an earlier infringement. Hook converted from the touchline. A couple of soft penalties had cost them that early lead, but Leigh Halfpenny, looking as dangerous as anyone, was worked clear down the right on the half-hour. A try seemed certain for a split second, but a superb tap tackle by Francois Trinh-Duc foiled him. The 11-3 half-time lead was pegged back by Hook less than two minutes into the second half, but that was as good as it got for Hook. From the restart his low, slow clearance thudded into the outstretched arms of another big hairy fellow, Julien Pierre, who sent Nallet, his comrade in darkness, over for an unlikely brace. Beaten in Paris by France's ugliest and their own inadequacies, Wales were now back in the bad old days. It got worse. Hook, having exchanged penalties with Morgan Parra, as the battle settled round the 10-point margin that had by now become the important one, was then sent to the sin bin for a careless, rather than dangerous, tackle on Parra. Minutes later, Vincent Clerc latched on to Trinh-Duc's chip kick, more or less where Hook should have been, and he was over. That was on the hour, and a flat occasion had been terminally flattened with a quarter of it still to run. Jonathan Davies had a hopeful charge at the line with 15 to go, which might have made things interesting vis-\u00e0-vis the 10-point margin if it had succeeded. But it didn't. As it was, the conversion of that try by Clerc condemned Wales to fourth place. The margin of Ireland's win over England had been of significance to them after all, but not in the way they had hoped. Wales, it seems, are now on the descent into choppy water; France may be pulling out of it. A week is a long time and all that. With these two in this mood, 80 minutes can seem an eternity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
