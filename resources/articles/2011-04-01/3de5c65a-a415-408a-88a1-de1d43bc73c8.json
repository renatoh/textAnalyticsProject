Meticulously incised using a traditional Japanese knife and hand-printed, the woodcuts still come across as utterly up to date with their pixellated compositional quiver. Yuasa bases each print of an enchanting garden or dreamy bedroom on a photograph that has been digitally processed in monochrome and thus afforded an almost impressionistic haze of inflected patternings. Such visual effects, when translated to the medium of woodblock cutting, take on an almost ritualised air of aesthetic wonderment, and Yuasa is surely on the way to being recognised as heir to the tradition of woodcut printmaking of his native Japan. Corn Exchange Gallery, to 27 May Robert Clark The Cult Of Beauty, London Rejecting Victorian Britain's grim realities, the aesthetic movement strove to create a world of perfect beauty. Indeed, this extensive V&amp;A study of its luxurious output has a certain resonance given our current dark days. \"Art for art's sake\" was the aesthetes' creed, and it spread from painting, sculpture and architecture to furniture and fashion. The artists were a rum bunch, kitting out their houses in oriental decor and amassing exotic beasts while painting auburn-haired women in gauzy gowns amid ornate furniture and foliage. While Dante Gabriel Rossetti or Frederic Lord Leighton delved into fantasy worlds, the poet, painter, socialist and designer William Morris brought those fantasies into the domestic realm with his prints for wallpapers and fabrics. V&amp;A, SW7, to 17 Jul Skye Sherwin Winston Roeth, Edinburgh A series of slate roof tiles, chiselled out of a quarry in Maine, are each painted a single colour and arranged in combinations across the gallery wall. That might be how Winston Roeth's uncompromisingly abstract art looks, but change viewpoints, let the light shift across their surfaces, contemplate their deceptive simplicity, reflect upon the peculiar resonance of their arrangement and they will charm you into appreciative submission. Roeth builds up layers of tempera, a quick-drying pre-oils medium affording highly subtle gradations of tone. Painstaking hours spent applying such layers mean that some tiles have yawning depths while others have an upfront radiance. Ingleby Gallery, to 14 May Robert Clark Savage Messiah, Leeds A centrepiece to this small exhibition is the manuscript of HS Ede's Savage Messiah, a 1929 biographical novel that charts the extraordinary, short career of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska before the sculptor was killed in the trenches in 1915. With his muscular, fragmented figures, Gaudier-Brzeska was unafraid to battle with the sensuous resistance of his raw materials. After his death at the age of 23, it was left to others to amplify his mythic status. So here are stills and posters from Ken Russell's 1972 film adaptation of Ede's book and the sculptor's portrait of poet Ezra Pound, champion of modernism and instigator of vorticism \u2013 a movement getting some overdue re-evaluation at Tate Britain in June. Henry Moore Institute, to 31 Jul Robert Clark Fa\u00e7ade: Through A Glass Darkly, Sunderland Despite being its single-medium remit, the National Glass Centre continues to stage exhibitions that are historically informative and culturally questioning as well as a delight to look at. This show focuses on the development of the glass fa\u00e7ade over the last 100 years. Yet beyond purely technical considerations, the curators present reflections on social and even psychological aspects. So Foster + Partners' plans are featured as a demonstration of the airy heights of glazed modernism. But in stark contrast, to represent the tradition of the blank fa\u00e7ade, here's also Gregor Schneider's proposal to infiltrate St Mark's Square with a vast monolithic cube of blackness. National Glass Centre, to 10 Jul Robert Clark James Stirling: Notes From The Archive, London James Stirling is a controversial figure, lauded and loathed for his contribution to modern architecture. While his glass box of a history faculty and library at Cambridge repelled students and has been threatened with demolition, his Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart attracted tourists in droves, and architecture's Stirling Prize is named after him. Whichever way you look at it, his buildings made bold statements. Housed in the Tate's Clore Gallery, which he designed, this fascinating show traces Stiling's career with drawings, notebooks and models that chart a course from the engineering building at Leicester University in the early-60s to Harvard's Sackler Museum and beyond. Tate Britain, SW1, Tue to 21 Aug Skye Sherwin Elizabeth Magill, Eastbourne Elizabeth Magill paints landscapes enchanted by memory and a knowing dose of nostalgic kitsch. Mottled plum-coloured skies and speckled yellow dawns are built up using thin washes of paint. Silhouettes of spooky trees twist bare branches or support leafy canopies lit up in salmon pink. More fantastical yet, in her latest series of small-scale paintings, a ballerina pirouettes on horseback, a naked dancer rides a magic carpet, and a lady of the lake punts through clouds of purple-orange mist. Informed by childhood memories of County Antrim, the Irish, London-based artist's vivid hazes recall a certain vein of children's book illustration as much as the paintings of Peter Doig. Towner, to 19 Jun Skye Sherwin Tom Price, London Tom Price's sculptures depict average guys you might meet on the street, but rarely encounter in neo-classical bronze form: black men whose facial expressions and physiques seem to hardwire them into a particular social class and moment. One memorable earlier nude clutched a mobile phone to his ear, but Price doesn't need props to help us place his men. His virtuoso renderings are so psychologically nuanced, the body language so artful and well-observed, that you might find yourself reading entire life stories into the deep-set lines around a mouth or the slouch of a shoulder. In fact, what he creates has no real-world equivalent. Rather than straight portraiture, he works with different models to build up composite studies. His latest series are fully clothed, their faces set in enigmatic contemplation. Hales Gallery, E1, Fri to 14 May Skye Sherwin"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
