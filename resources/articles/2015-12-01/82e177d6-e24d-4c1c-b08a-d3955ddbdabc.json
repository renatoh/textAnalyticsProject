The National Fraternal Order of Police has been lobbying the NFL unsuccessfully since 2013, when the ban was introduced. But the recent attacks in Paris by Islamic State-affiliated operatives have prompted another push. One of the Paris attacks saw three suicide bombers attempt to enter the soccer stadium where the French national team, watched by their president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, was playing a match. They were foiled as they tried to gain access, and blew themselves up. Union president Chuck Canterbury sent a letter to the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, on 20 November, urging him \u201cto rescind this policy, which weakens the safety and security of NFL players, personnel and fans\u201d. \u201cThe terrorist attacks and threats of attacks from organizations like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) are selecting targets based on the amount of death and injury they can inflict \u2013 mass murder and casualty events,\u201d Canterbury wrote. The letter continued: \u201cWell-attended venues and areas are being deliberately targeted by the radical killers who do not intend or expect to survive the assault. Law enforcement, even when working actively with highly trained and skilled security professionals, cannot be certain that all threats will be detected and neutralized.\u201d On a more local level, the Ohio Fraternal Order of Police has asked the state\u2019s leading football teams, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Cleveland Browns, to overturn the policy. The unions are especially keen for off-duty police officers to be permitted to take concealed firearms to football games. In New York City, the Sergeants Benevolent Association police union, has started a petition to overturn the ban on the basis that it \u201ccompromises public safety\u201d, according to a local report. And Detroit police union leaders have also written to the NFL, saying: \u201cLaw enforcement officers often carry a weapon while off duty not only for their own personal protection but to provide a critical response when circumstances call for immediate police action,\u201d according to a Detroit media report. The letter went on to say: \u201cCurrent events, not least the unconscionable acts of terrorism we have recently experienced, only add to the desirability of having readily available armed law enforcement officers, even if they are not officially \u2018on duty\u2019.\u201d Currently, only the Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys have been granted an exemption from the ban \u2013 the NFL concluded that Texas state law overruled the league\u2019s policy. An attempt to overturn the ban in Minnesota was denied by an appeals court. The NFL explained in a letter to Canterbury in 2013 that while the organization had every respect for members of law enforcement and did not consider off duty officers carrying firearms to be a risk to the public or players, \u201cwe believe that public safety inside our stadiums is best served by limiting the carrying of firearms to on-duty law enforcement officers specifically assigned to work the game\u201d. A spokesman has reiterated that stance in response to the latest flurry of lobbying by police unions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
