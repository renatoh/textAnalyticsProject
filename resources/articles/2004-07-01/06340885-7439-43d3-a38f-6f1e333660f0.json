Greg Dyke", "bodyText": "Job: former director general, BBC Age: 57 Industry: broadcasting 2003 ranking: 1 What a 12 months it has been for Greg Dyke. This time last year he sat atop the MediaGuardian 100 as the most powerful force in British broadcasting. Then came Andrew Gilligan's 6.07am Today programme report, the death of David Kelly and the damning verdict of the Hutton report. His resignation as director general in January will be remembered for the extraordinary scenes in which he was mobbed by staff who staged an impromptu mass walkout. But Mr Dyke wasn't out of the spotlight for long, returning to host an episode of BBC1's Have I Got News for You. \"I'm Greg Dyke and my motto was cut the crap,\" ran his introduction. \"And looking around me tonight maybe I didn't entirely succeed.\" This year's biggest faller, Mr Dyke makes it back onto this list because he retains a considerable media presence. He is linked with just about every big job going, including the chief executive's job at ITV currently occupied by Charles Allen. He is also on the advisory board of Haim Saban's German TV company, where he was reunited with his old Sky adversary Tony Ball, as the media entrepreneur seeks to expand his European pay-TV business. Mr Dyke will be back in the headlines soon with the publication of his eagerly awaited memoirs, which are expected to severely criticise Tony Blair and Lord Hutton's findings. The deal with publisher HarperCollins was believed to be worth \u00a3500,000. He will also front a Channel 4 documentary about his four years in charge of the corporation. If Hutton put an untimely end to his action-packed BBC career it has also endeared him further to the broadcasting industry - as his subsequent RTS and Broadcasting Press Guild awards confirm. \"It's a funny world,\" he quipped. \"I've been in this business 30 years and no one has ever given me an award for anything. I get fired and I get two in a fortnight.\" There is something about Mr Dyke's plain-talking and infectious enthusiasm that that makes you certain it won't be long before is he back cutting the crap in a major broadcasting role somewhere or other. He did find time to offer his successor Mark Thompson some advice: \"One tip - watch your back.\" \"He was damaged but not destroyed by Hutton,\" said one panellist. \"He has got to move on and get another job, but he won't be able to do that until the cathartic experience of the book. He is unemployed at the moment but who knows? He could be running ITV by September.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
