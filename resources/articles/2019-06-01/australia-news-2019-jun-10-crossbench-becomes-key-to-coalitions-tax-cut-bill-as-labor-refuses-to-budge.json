Amid the stand-off between the Coalition and Labor over the government\u2019s key election pledge, the passage of the legislation could come down to crossbench senators who are leaving open the possibility of supporting the plan. On Monday, Pauline Hanson indicated she would oppose the third stage of the government\u2019s $158bn tax cut package, saying she was \u201cnot sold\u201d on the economic argument of the boost for higher income earners. She called on the government to prioritise \u201cnation-building\u201d projects, naming a coal-fired power station, the Bradfield water scheme first proposed in the 1930s and a royal commission into the family courts system as key to her support. \u201cI strongly believe the people of Australia gave One Nation the shared balance-of-power responsibility to ensure this government starts constructing nation-building projects,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cIf there are three things I want to achieve before leaving parliament, the government now know what they are.\u201d The Coalition is on track to hold 35 seats in the new Senate when parliament returns in July, and needs 39 votes to secure the majority needed to pass legislation. If it gains the support of conservative Cory Bernardi, the Coalition will still need to secure three more votes from the Senate crossbench, expected to comprise Jacqui Lambie, and two senators from each of One Nation and Centre Alliance. Centre Alliance has offered the Coalition a lifeline, suggesting that the minor party \u201cwould love to give hardworking Australians a tax cut\u201d if it was confident income tax rebates would not cause cuts to services down the line. It is awaiting briefings from Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia. While the government is still hopeful of securing a deal with minor parties, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, called on the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to abandon the \u201cpolitics of envy\u201d and side with the government to pass the tax cuts into law. \u201cWill he just persist with Labor\u2019s failed politics of envy, which was so comprehensively rejected by the Australian people at the last election, by standing in the way of the income tax relief that Australians voted for? Or will he show the Australian people that he has learned and listened by embracing the plan that we took to the election and Australians supported?\u201d Cormann said on Monday. Albanese said the opposition was ready to pass the first stage of the tax cuts that will deliver up to $1,080 in tax relief to low and middle income earners this year, but has said the party is unconvinced of the need for a 30% tax rate for all workers earning up to $200,000 by 2024-25. \u201cTo talk about six years\u2019 time is a triumph of hope over economic reality to suggest that people know what the economy will look like at that point in time,\u201d Albanese said. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said it was a \u201cbad idea\u201d to commit five years out to \u201cbig tax cuts\u201d for high-income earners who were less likely to spend the extra money than lower income earners. \u201cWe call on Scott Morrison to split his tax plan up so that the parliament can urgently support and pass tax relief for people on low and middle incomes in this country,\u201d Chalmers said. The newly appointed shadow minister pointed to advice from the Reserve Bank which has flagged support for an injection of disposable income into the community as Australia\u2019s growth slowed. \u201cThe best way to get that is to stop playing games in the Senate and to make sure that we can pass the first tranche of the government\u2019s tax plan, which would give up to $1,080 to the people who need it most and the people who are most likely to spend it in the economy,\u201d Chalmers said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
