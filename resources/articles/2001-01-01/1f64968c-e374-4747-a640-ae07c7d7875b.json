Champions five times between 1894 and 1900, they also won two FA Cups. The chairman William McGregor declared: \"If there is a club in the country which deserves to be dubbed the greatest, few will deny the right of Aston Villa to share the highest niche of fame.\" Arsenal 1931, '33, '34, '35, '38 There was more than good fortune behind Lucky Arsenal's dominance of the 30s, when they won five titles and two FA Cups. Herbert Chapman had transformed the club after his appointment in 1925 and George Allison provided a smooth transition after Chapman's death in 1934. Their 1938 success came with the lowest ever points total, 52. Liverpool 1976, '77, '79, '80, '82, '83, '84, '86, '88, '90 In winning 25 major trophies between 1973 and 1990 Liverpool established themselves as a fearsome force at home and in Europe. Four European Cups and two Uefa Cups were collected and the possibility of even greater European success was thwarted by the Heysel disaster of 1985."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
