They just don't do it", "bodyText": "The old slogan sang, \"Don't just do it, B&amp;Q it\". This, alas, is not as straightforward as it sounds. Alastair Duncan needed a shed. B&amp;Q offered a tempting online menu from which to choose so Duncan selected a model, parted with \u00a3219 plus a \u00a315 delivery charge, and was told he would be contacted within three days to arrange delivery. Three days later there was still no call so Duncan rang B&amp;Q and discovered said shed was being supplied by another company and he would have to wait for a call from them. Another long silence followed so Duncan went back to B&amp;Q, which declared itself unable to chase the other company on his behalf and gave him a telephone number so he could do the legwork himself. Thereafter his days were hectic with attempts to get through to a human. When he did so two weeks later he was informed that the firm could only deliver on Wednesdays, and since Wednesdays were incompatible with Duncan's job he was asked whether he minded the shed being dumped outside his house in his absence. He did mind and was subsequently told he should return to B&amp;Q to cancel the order. And so followed another phone call and a discovery he could only complain in writing, and that once he'd dredged up pen and ink he would have to wait 10 days for his refund to be processed. He did eventually get his money back but his savings have been depleted by the multiple expensive phone calls, he remains shedless, and it has occurred to no one to apologise to him. B&amp;Q's press office is fulsome in its contrition. It confirms the obvious: Duncan's contract was with B&amp;Q and B&amp;Q should have nursed him through any hiccups. The company blames a \"catalogue of errors\" including the fact that Duncan was told he could only request a refund in writing. It promises it will learn from its mistakes and has sent Duncan a refund of his call charges plus a gift voucher, perhaps so he can repeat the experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
