I think I even managed to work out what was happening. Colonel Mayhew, that sly resistance fox, didn\u2019t want the clapped-out old king to escape after all, and Archer, Harry and Sylvia took the comatose monarch all the way to the south coast just to see him killed by a detachment of Huth\u2019s men. The spiky, sexy Sylvia died in the same hail of bullets that did for the king, while Harry bought one in the leg but was last seen in the care of some yokellish resistance men and seemed likely to survive. Mayhew was playing a rum game, using the supposed escape of the king to lure the guards away from the nearby atomic research station while US ships pounded the plant, undermining the Germans\u2019 own nuclear efforts and, even more important, giving the US an early taste of military action. \u201cYou got the Americans fighting,\u201d Huth tells Archer when he rumbles what Mayhew had been up to. \u201cThey\u2019ve tasted blood and, mark my words, they will build the bomb and the Reich will be finished.\u201d It was good at least to know the end of the geopolitical story. After four sometimes dreary episodes, the denouement was much better \u2013 taut, gripping, complex. Suddenly everything shifted. Mayhew was Mr Big, the man with the plan, using Archer, Sylvia, even the king as pawns in his game, collateral damage. He didn\u2019t want an old, infirm monarch to get to the US; he wanted the queen and the princesses to galvanise American opinion. We also saw Huth in an entirely new light. Played \u2013 as he said \u201clike a fool\u201d \u2013 by Mayhew, he had raced down to Bringle to head off the king\u2019s escape, only inadvertently to help the US attack on the nuclear facility. For that act, with his rival General Kellermann in hot pursuit, he was to pay with his life \u2013 death by firing squad. Before his execution there was a marvellous scene with Kellermann \u2013 by far the best in the series. You could feel their loathing for each other in every sentence; see it in every facial twitch. Huth had the last word. \u201cYou are a bastard Kellermann, but I take great pleasure in the certainty that the F\u00fchrer will soon purge himself of you like the giant turd you are.\u201d It sounded even better in German. Huth, in a conversation with Archer just before Kellermann arrived, revealed himself as cultured, world-weary, even caring. He knew the grand house in which these final scenes were played out from a pre-war visit and, keen for Archer to survive for the sake of the superintendent\u2019s son, showed him where to hide when Kellermann arrived \u2013 in a priest-hole; sanctuary from the Nazi inquisition. With Archer safe, Huth met his end bravely: refusing a blindfold with an aristocratic waft of the hand, looking the members of the firing squad in the eye, tensing only slightly as the moment of his death approached. Kellermann, such a charming presence in the early episodes, really was revealed as a bastard here: anxious to torture the beautiful Barga until a lawyer from the US embassy arrived in the nick of time; extracting information from an already blood-spattered German soldier \u2013 Kellermann reckoned his victim was spying on him for Huth \u2013 by placing fish hooks in his throat; making sure Huth was dispatched immediately; and disappointed that Archer wasn\u2019t facing a firing squad too. The moral? Never trust a German in a tweed suit. And conversely, in the case of Huth, just because a Nazi is obsessed with polishing his boots doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s all bad. The conclusion, if we can call it that, was suitably odd. Archer escapes, reclaiming from Huth the atomic bomb secrets which, you will recall, are on a roll of film inside a cigar tube. The irony is that if Huth had known what he briefly had in his possession he would have escaped the firing squad and been the hero he craved to be. (Huth, who clearly would have been happier indulging in philosophical argument or composing modernist music at Darmstadt, seems to have been driven into the military by some sort of Oedipal complex \u2013 an urge to be better than his hated father.) What Archer will do with the formulae that can build an atomic bomb and change the course of the war is far from clear as we last see him wandering across some blasted heath. He\u2019s a wanted man; all his colleagues are dead or injured; he really is now the lost soul he\u2019s resembled from the start. We leave him in such a limbo that I wondered whether there would be another episode in which we would get the true resolution, but apparently not. Perhaps the producers ran out of money, or this open-ended (non)conclusion is what we call Art. Back at the American embassy, Barbara Barga suddenly leaves the safety of a room in which she and two officials are listening to casualty reports from the Bringle Sands attack and strides purposefully to ... well, where? The exit? The street? The dangerous, Nazi-infested world outside? I suppose the implication is that she is going in search of her beloved Archer, but he\u2019s about a hundred miles and quite a few checkpoints away and the chance of them living happily ever after is small. In any case, Sylvia was The One for Archer, and poor Sylvia is dead. In the end, was it worth it? Huth and Kellermann were memorable. Archer had his moments, but that strangulated delivery remained a problem. If you play a character as a cypher \u2013 and a mumbling cypher at that \u2013 it palls over five hours. Harry was one-dimensional; the posh resistance men in cravats melded into one; and promising characters like the one-armed Spode and the art dealer who was a key link man for the resistance just weren\u2019t developed enough. The dialogue was often tin-eared \u2013 Sylvia simply would not have called the king \u201cGeorgie\u201d! \u2013 though there were a few good set-pieces in this finale. The pace sagged in the early episodes, and there was too little of the public face of what German rule looked like \u2013 everything was internalised and played in dusty, ill-lit rooms (maybe there were budget constraints). I could have done with a few more Highgate-type atrocities, and perhaps a Newport Pagnell rally or two. But most of all the horror of what life in an occupied country was like was underplayed, perhaps because this Sunday evening slot, while a little hard-edged, is also supposed to be family viewing. The improbably handsome superintendent, the beautiful American woman and the occasional country-house interiors all felt like they were obeying some law of Sunday night television. It was a kind of National Trust view of what an occupation would be like, with Huth alone offering something quirkier and deeper and stranger. What did you think? Did the elusive ending satisfy you, or were you left craving certainty? Any guesses as to what happens to Archer, Barga, Kellermann, Little Douggie? Another series to tie up the loose ends perhaps \u2013 or is that quite enough of Nazis for the moment?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
