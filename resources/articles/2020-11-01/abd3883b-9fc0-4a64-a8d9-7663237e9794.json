According to Google Trends, in 2004 we were nose-deep in coconut-rich bowls of Peranakan laksa. Ten years on, we started airlifting ramen noodles from their Japanese tonkotsu, shoyu or miso broths. And while laksa has fallen, relatively, from favour and ramen continues its steep ascent, demand for Vietnamese pho has been more consistent; we\u2019ve been adding bean sprouts to our beef-rich bowls of rice noodles for the past decade. This sums up the country\u2019s noodle-slurping habits \u2013 except for in the Northern Territory, where searches for laksa outnumber both ramen and pho by two to one. This fixation is best illustrated by the Darwin Laksa festival, the brainchild of the chief minister, Michael Gunner. (Could you imagine this elsewhere, like New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian personally creating a wonton soup festival?) In Darwin, festival day 29 November is preceded by a month-long celebration of the dish, with eateries showcasing traditional bowls as well as reinvented versions: laksa martinis, ice-cream, panna cotta and smoothies. More than 20,000 laksas were sold during last year\u2019s festival, enough to create a towering bowl stack that\u2019s twice Uluru\u2019s height. So why is the Northern Territory obsessed with laksa? \u201cWe\u2019re as multicultural as it comes,\u201d says Jason Hanna from the Activate Darwin team behind the festival. Darwin is our closest capital city to Asia and one-third of the territory was born overseas. Rewind to 1900 and locals of Chinese descent outnumbered European-Australians six to one. Darwin\u2019s climate also adds to laksa\u2019s appeal. \u201cIt actually tastes better during the wet season when you\u2019re sweating your arse off,\u201d he says. At the restaurauteur\u2019s seven Darwin venues, \u201call but the pizza shop serves laksa\u201d. Chow, his Vietnamese-inspired eatery, even offers laksa \u2013 which often outsells the pho. \u201cRamen\u2019s only just come to Darwin,\u201d says Hanna. City Cafe is one of the few places serving tonkotsu: its chef Kiyoshi Makizono spends over eight hours boiling pork bones for the broth. He\u2019s from Hakata, Fukuoka, a Japanese region famous for this ramen style. He\u2019s contributing a ramen laksa to the festival; it\u2019s topped with pork chashu, marinated egg and tofu puffs. \u201cLaksa is the epitome of what Aussies love about south-east Asian cuisine,\u201d says Sydney chef Dan Hong (Mr Wong, Lotus). \u201cIt\u2019s a noodle soup and a curry all in one. I think that\u2019s why Aussies loved it so much. But I think 10 years ago [in the rest of Australia], it was bastardised.\u201d Enter ramen, which gets fanfare for its labour-intensive approach. Cult Sydney hole-in-the-wall Gumshara\u2019s chefs spend 14 hours on its collagen-rich tonkotsu broth, and noodle nerds spend hours tweaking the technical requirements to perfect the alkaline water and get the springy noodles right. Michelle Widjaja spent six months on her noodle-making before training in Osaka. When she opened Iiko Mazesoba last year in Sydney\u2019s Darling Square, she found a secondhand machine (retail price tag: $20,000) for making noodles from scratch. Ramen\u2019s wide-ranging forms \u2013 with many regional differences from Kyoto to Sapporo \u2013 has given it a culinary flexibility that\u2019s helped it dominate trends in recent years. Widjaja, for instance, sells mazesoba, which is a soupless ramen, where you swirl the sauces and toppings into the noodles. She also offers tsukemen, a chilled ramen, which is eaten with a dipping sauce \u2013 her vegan version channels smashed avocado toast. At Iiko Mazesoba, she\u2019s produced matcha noodles, blue ramen to celebrate Frozen\u2019s theatre season, and might make glow-in-the-dark ramen if Vivid Sydney goes ahead next year. This shapeshifting and exclusivity helps ramen stay on trend \u2013 and in everyone\u2019s Instagram feed. It\u2019s intrinsic to ramen: Hong remembers when Blancharu and Ichiban Boshi each only offered 20 bowls a day in Sydney, and always sold out. While this reduced output is for quality reasons, the limited-edition nature only increased interest. \u201cIt\u2019s a hype thing,\u201d says Hong. Ramen\u2019s enduring popularity is also because it\u2019s more than a noodle soup, it\u2019s a lifestyle. \u201cRamen is life\u201d is a popular catchcry. \u201cPeople are proud to be part of the ramen culture,\u201d says Widjaja. It\u2019s why she\u2019s in a Facebook group called Ramen Gang and the ramen merch at her eatery \u2013 like the bucket hat and tote bag \u2013 are top-selling items. Pho, meanwhile, is a reliable constant. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Golden Gaytime of noodle soups,\u201d says Hong. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get sick of it.\u201d In Melbourne, where pho remains neck and neck with ramen as the most searched for noodle soup, Jerry Mai serves more than 100,000 bowls of steaming broth a year at her Pho Nom eateries. She thinks international student populations can be tied to noodle trends: laksa was more popular 15 years ago, \u201cbecause there were a lot more students from Malaysia and Singapore\u201d, she says. \u201cIn the last few years, there\u2019ve been a lot of students here from Hanoi,\u201d she adds. It\u2019s led to more pho from that region, the \u201chumble\u201d counterpart to the extravagant southern style with its garnishes and sides. She also credits health trends for laksa\u2019s dimmed popularity. \u201cI think that richness and creamy coconut has deterred some people,\u201d she says. Whereas the wellness halo around bone broth has no doubt aided the demand for both pho and ramen. Could the rest of Australia take Darwin\u2019s lead and return to loving laksa? Well, it hasn\u2019t truly gone away, Hong believes. \u201cThe OG laksa places are still really packed,\u201d he says. Sydney\u2019s Malay Chinese Takeaway, which has \u201cthe world\u2019s best laksa\u201d, still has queues. Widjaja agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be as hyped as ramen is, but it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
