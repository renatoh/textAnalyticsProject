With his yellow ties and generous quiff, he stands ever ready to slam the unions and moan about Europe. But he also has a great plan to turn Dover harbour into a \"people's port\" by transferring ownership to a community trust. Sadly, his scheme has come up against the Liberal Democrats' ideological fixation with the free market. And its looming failure points to a broader trend: this Conservative-led government's growing contempt for the cultural fabric of Britain. It is tempting to blame the nasty bits on the Tories, but rumours waft across Whitehall that it is the Lib Dems who show most ardour in unpicking the postwar state. Vince Cable behaves as if he still believes the department for business should be closed down; Danny Alexander berates Michael Gove for not being tough enough on the teachers' unions; and David Laws continues to make the case for a slash and burn approach to the public finances. For these neoLiberal Democrats of the Orange Book school remain determined to junk social liberalism for economic liberalism. Their guiding light is the Gladstonian ideal of a low tax, laissez-faire, \"night-watchman state\". And their ambitions are castrating the government's plans for the \"big society\". We are told by philosopher turned Tory MP Jesse Norman that the \"big society\" means a focus \"on human beings not as economic atoms but as bundles of capability; on intermediate institutions between the individual and the state; and on society and individual rights as such, rather than as mediated by the state\". However, such lofty ideals seem to have little impact on actual policy. So Elphicke is getting nowhere with his proposals for Dover port as a public asset, locally owned and run. The harbour board simply wants to privatise the facility and allow shareholders to pocket the \u00a325m annual profits. Sadly, all the indications are that the Treasury is ready for just such a quick disposal to whichever sovereign wealth fund comes up with enough cash for the white cliffs. Go inland and a similar battle is raging. The future of British Waterways \u2013 the quango in charge of 2,200 miles of canals and waterways \u2013 is under review at the department for the environment. More progressive-minded ministers want it made into a National Trust-style co-operative for the good of boat owners, ramblers and anglers. This would protect its endowment and public service ethos from the \u00a3400m fire sale that Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander is considering. An ominous departmental silence seems to suggest the privatisers are pushing ahead. From water to woods, it is the same story. Tomorrow's debate on the future of the Forestry Commission will reveal a government that values state assets not as an important part of civil society but simply an opportunity for a quick profit. Despite all the talk of Edmund Burke and intermediary institutions, it is the privatisation of the public realm that is uppermost in ministers' minds. Such is the neoliberal moment that Cable was happy to push through a bill privatising Royal Mail and, with it, the removal of the Queen's head from stamps. One doesn't have to be a signed and sealed monarchist to believe a tradition which has existed since the 1840s, and is regarded with affection by millions, might have some social value. But if you are desperate to offload the mail on to Deutsche Post, such romantic conservatism is simply obstructive. So it goes on: the assault on county boundaries, closing of public libraries, funding cuts for community pubs, mutilation of the BBC World Service. This is a government with little feel for the warp and weft of British life: it is rationalist, technocratic, and arrogant. It thinks it can build the \"big society\" on the cheap when, in fact, a civil society of port trusts, waterway co-operatives and forest charities demands sustained social investment. Instead, what inspires the coalition is a programme of creative destruction. Lib Dem-supporting Tory outrider Nick Boles has even called for a period of \"chaos\" in local communities to allow the free market to find its level. None of this bodes well for the trust, social capital and stability a blossoming \"big society\" needs. For all Elphicke and Norman's talk about people's ports and \"little platoons\", the fact is that a free-market fundamentalism has gripped this government. Even as it revives history teaching, many of the landscapes, institutions and habits that connect past to present and community to country are being insidiously undermined."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
