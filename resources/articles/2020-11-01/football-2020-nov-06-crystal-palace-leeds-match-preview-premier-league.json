Hodgson\u2019s side give nothing away and will be well prepared to hold firm and launch counterattacks while the visitors, level on points with Palace, go through their death by a thousand passes routine. It has worked well for the equally experienced Marcelo Bielsa but last week\u2019s defeat to Leicester was Leeds\u2019 poorest showing so far. Avoiding a painful slump from an excellent comeback to the top flight would be ideal before the international break.
