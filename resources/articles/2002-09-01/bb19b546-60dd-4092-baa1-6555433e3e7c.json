Just eight days after Peter Enckelman's blunder for Aston Villa in the Birmingham derby, and following the more recent pillorying of Arsenal's David Seaman and Wimbledon's Kelvin Davies, Debec handed Bradford a point with a howler of similar proportions. The Frenchman was making only his third appearance for Gary McAllister's side following his summer signing from Rennes, and he brought his previously impeccable record of two clean sheets to an end when he let Paul Evans's tame drive squirm under his body. Debec's blushes were at least partially spared when Jay Bothroyd headed home in the 83rd minute from Gary McSheffrey's cross to deny Bradford a deserved three points. Both sides belong in that ever-growing category of First Division clubs burdened by crippling Premiership outgoings, and their respective progress during the opening weeks of the season was regarded as something of an over-achievement. Bradford's limited expectations were spelled by manager Nicky Law before the game when he confirmed that their current standing in the top half of the table was an irrelevance until the pre-season aim of survival had been attained. Safety may be the priority, but on the evidence of the initial exchanges Bradford's players have not yet been inhibited by Law's caution. The Yorkshiremen were the most enterprising early on and would have been ahead in the 10th minute had Danny Cadamarteri not wasted a genuine opening. Coventry struggled to establish any meaningful possession, while Bradford continued to press with midfielder Paul Evans happy to shoot on sight. Evans was finally rewarded for his persistence when he collected Wayne Jacobs' short free kick and launched the half-hearted low drive from 25 yards which redenned Debec's cheeks. Debec was given the opportunity to redeem himself moments before the interval when Michael Proctor hit a firm left-foot drive that the keeper did well to parry, and the Frenchman followed that effort with an acrobatic lunge to keep out another Evans strike. Bradford City (4-4-2): Davison (Banks, 67); Uhlenbeek, Molenaar, Bower, Jacobs; Gray, Jorgensen, Evans, Warnock; Cadamarteri, Proctor. Coventry City (4-4-2): Debec; Caldwell, Konjic, Davenport, Gordon; Chippo, McAllister, Safri, Normann (Mills, 46); Bothroyd, McSheffrey.
