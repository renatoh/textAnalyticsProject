Here, the big themes of Herbie Hancock and composer/arranger Tadd Dameron are explored through Waterman's taut arrangements for mid-sized band. Dameron's star rose briefly in the late 1940s, then drugs-related imprisonment more or less felled him a decade later. But he bridged big-band swing and the advances of bebop with a visionary sophistication faithfully reflected here on classics like Lady Bird and the playfully contrapuntal Good Bait. Interweaving Hancock's music, Waterman touches on the iconic vamp of Maiden Voyage but mainly explores it as an improvisation, and ingeniously hitches Watermelon Man to the famous funk riff from Chameleon, generating considerable collective heat in the process. Veteran singer Frank Holder eases through a fine Nat Cole-inspired If You Could See Me Now, and Waterman turns Hancock's Dolphin Dance into a swirl of overlapping melodies, and the usually languorous Canteloupe Island into a terrific, headlong gallop. A tribute album of intelligence and taste, and with plenty of strong soloing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
