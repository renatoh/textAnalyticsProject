Many yards behind Hoy, only the Australian Jason Niblett finished on his bike, and the applause for the Scot was such that he had no idea what was going on behind him. The sell-out crowd rose to their feet, and rightly so, as the triple Olympic champion came from the back of the string as the bell rang for the final lap, surging past his opponents down the back straight. It was impeccable timing in every way. As the other five struggled to find Hoy's wheel, the World Cup leader, Azizulhasni Awang, attempted to come through a gap, bringing down the Spaniard Juan Peralta at approaching 45mph. In taking evasive action, the Pole Kamil Kuczynski then collided with the New Zealander Edward Dawkins and the run-out area was a mass of bikes and bodies, with riders running across the line to finish and Peralta falling again as his carbon-fibre shoes went from under him. Awang, however, ended up with a vast splinter going right through his substantial calf muscle, winning a slow-motion sprint for third before subsiding on to a stretcher. He was screaming, not unreasonably. The risks simply underline how impressive it is that Hoy has made this event his own, particularly when he has also added a new string to his tactical bow. His trademark hitherto was winning from the front, letting a gap open to the motorbike then surging away from the opposition in the final two laps. In all three rides he came from the rear of the string, again hanging back to let a gap open in front of him, but coming over the top in the final lap and a half. He likens the manoeuvre to \"an underpowered car overtaking a truck: you hang back, speed up and speed up and you get past much quicker; it means you hit them with so much speed that if they try to react, it's too late.\" Hoy, however, looks anything but underpowered. He said that this event may suit him better than the more tactical match sprint, and this weekend's events bear that out. While Hoy had made a premature exit in the semi-final of the match sprint on Friday, the queen of British track racing suffered the same fate at the same stage on Saturday night. Victoria Pendleton has taken five world titles in the last six years as well as Olympic gold in her speciality, the match sprint, but she handed the initiative to her old rival, Anna Meares of Australia, in the semi. Pendleton did not look at the races when it counted yesterday, although she delighted the crowd by taking the bronze medal from Olga Panarina, but she has a chance to make amends in the keirin. Becky James, 19, and Jess Varnish, 20, teamed up to finish fourth in the team sprint on Friday and on Saturday afternoon they both made it through to the final eight, but the gap between them and the two top women was exposed as Pendleton got rid of James in two rides and Varnish went the same way against Meares. \"I will never say never but it will be incredibly hard for them to overtake Vicky before London [2012], because to do that they would have to be the best in the world,\" said the Great Britain sprint coach, Jan van Eijden. \"That's a massive task.\" The World Cup meeting comes to a climax with two of the most spectacular men's events, the 4,000m team pursuit and the team sprint, in which Hoy will have another medal chance, when he teams up with Matt Crampton and Jason Kenny. In the team pursuit, the Olympic gold medallists Bradley Wiggins and Geraint Thomas return to the track \u2013 in Wiggins's case for the first time since Beijing \u2013 and there is speculation that together with Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Andy Tennant they may come close to the world record they set in Beijing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
