Police are searching for the driver of a black Audi A4 that hit the group by the Salisbury Club in Brinnington shortly before 10.45pm on Sunday. The driver fled the scene after the incident. The victim, believed to be in his 30s, died in hospital. Two men, aged 31 and 33, sustained minor injuries in the collision. The car was later found abandoned in the second lane of a nearby stretch of the M60. Witnesses reported seeing the driver climbing over a fence and running away. DI Kris Williams of Greater Manchester police said: \u201cMy thoughts go out to the man\u2019s family who sadly have to deal with the tragic news that their loved one has died. \u201cWe\u2019ve already spoken to a number of witnesses in the area and will continue to do so to build a fuller picture of what has exactly happened, but from what we know so far, we believe the driver of the car scaled the fence next to the M60 and ran away. \u201cWhatever information people have, I\u2019d encourage them to contact us as a matter of urgency.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
