I've just returned from Paris, and things are far worse across the Channel as far as family friendliness in cultural institutions is concerned. I was hopeful. Mirroring this country's Museums and Galleries Month in May, the French have Printemps des Mus\u00e9es. Tomorrow more than 500 museums in France will be free, with the theme of \"Take Your Parents to the Museum\" (printempsdes musees.culture.fr). So three-year-old River whisked me, his mum, to the Gare du Nord on Eurostar, and put me up in the comfortingly predictable Novotel les Halles, where even he was in walking distance of anywhere we wanted to go (novotel.com). We began with the Pompidou Centre, which houses the Musee National d'Art Moderne, where I asked at the information desk for a guide to help me take a three-year-old around - or rather, which would help River take me. I was handed a two-paged leaflet listing the Saturday morning workshops, even though it wasn't Saturday. There were no free activity sheets, no colourful pamplets to help us share the joy of a Miro or Matisse. It was even worse at the Louvre, where there was no leaflet at all, just a free floor plan. Perhaps there'll be more on offer tomorrow, when the festival is in full swing. But taking your parents should be a daily, not once-every-365-days, event. \u00b7 Please send tips for sharing to travelwithkids@aol.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
