The scheme, launched by David Cameron in 2011 after the London riots, targets families with repeating generational patterns of youth crime, long-term unemployment, teenage pregnancy and substance abuse. It was expanded in 2015 to reach 400,000 families, but has attracted criticism for the pejorative ways that it has described the families it had been designed to help. Cameron blamed a small number of families for \u201ca culture of disruption and irresponsibility that cascades down the generations\u201d. Louise Casey, the high-profile government adviser who launched the programme, told the Telegraph at the time: \u201cWe should be talking about things like shame and guilt \u2026 we have lost the ability to be judgmental because we worry about being seen as nasty to poor people.\u201d Announcing the interim findings from a national evaluation of the programme, Brokenshire said it had reduced the proportion of children going into care by a third and the proportion of adults being sent to prison by a quarter, compared with a similar control group. However, he said the government \u201cneeds to look again at the name of the programme\u201d and said the use of the term \u201ctroubled families\u201d \u201cobscures as much as it enlightens\u201d. He said: \u201cAt its worst, it points an accusing finger at people, who are already isolated, and says to them: \u2018You are the \u201cothers\u201d and you are not like the rest of us when, in truth, they are like the rest of us; they\u2019ve just had a little less help, been a little less lucky and, yes, made choices themselves that haven\u2019t led to the best outcomes. But we don\u2019t give up on people in this country. People can make the most of a second chance. That is the lesson of the programme.\u201d The programme\u2019s keyworkers engage with the whole family, rather than individuals. Casey said it had \u201cvery deliberately shaken up the way families with complex problems are supported\u201d and said the results proved it had been right to invest in this approach. Brokenshire said he wanted to see a particular focus on knife crime within the programme. The government said a \u00a39.5m fund would be made available within the existing Troubled Families programme to focus on supporting children and families vulnerable to knife and gang crime. The government has previously been criticised for misleading claims that the flagship project turned around the lives of 99% of the most-troubled families and for overstating its money-saving benefits. A 2016 study by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government concluded there was no clear evidence that the programme had any serious effect and that ministers may have underestimated the scale of the problems. Tom McBride, the director of evidence at the Early Intervention Foundation (EIF), said the new analysis was encouraging. \u201cWe hope the government will use the forthcoming spending review to continue to invest in high-quality, targeted support for vulnerable families, to help children growing up in these situations to avoid the very worst life outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government also deserves credit for investing the time and resources to rigorously evaluate the Troubled Families programme. Most government initiatives are not well evaluated \u2013 which doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t work, but it does mean we don\u2019t know.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
