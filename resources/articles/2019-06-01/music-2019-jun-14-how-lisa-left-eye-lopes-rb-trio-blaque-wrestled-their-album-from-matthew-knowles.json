Discovered by Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopes, the teen three-piece perfected the slinky stutters of that era\u2019s R&amp;B pop, with imagery that repacked Missy Elliott\u2019s third-eye Afrofuturism for a gel pen-loving generation. As a kid-friendly TLC, Shamari DeVoe (n\u00e9e Fears), Brandi Williams and Natina Reed shared their predecessors\u2019 intolerance for scrubs. If men featured in their videos, they were eyeballed like pick\u2019n\u2019mix and then discarded, unworthy of being in their orbit. Blaque\u2019s boldness \u2013 down to their homemade bubblewrap look \u2013 turned out to be their special sauce. With 1.5m debut album sales and tour dates with \u2018NSync and TLC, they were poised to become 00s pop\u2019s next mammoth girl group. Second album, Blaque Out!, however, was scrapped (it showed up on iTunes a decade later), while its feisty lead single Can\u2019t Get It Back flopped and became a hit for Mis-Teeq instead. Then, following the death of Left Eye in 2002, Blaque lost their biggest cheerleader. \u201cI definitely felt let down by the industry,\u201d says DeVoe, also a cast member on Real Housewives of Atlanta. \u201cThere was a point where I lost my passion to ever want to sing again.\u201d After Reed\u2019s tragic death in a road accident in 2012, fan clamour for another unreleased Blaque album, 2003\u2019s Torch, began to grow. Encouraged by a petition, the group won back the rights to their recordings from one-time manager Matthew Knowles, and the album finally came out last month. \u201cIt feels really good to finally release it,\u201d says Williams. \u201cAnd with us able to own these songs now, and our fans still wanting to hear them, I actually think this is perfect timing.\u201d Despite its of-the-time production, Torch is a way more fun and inventive R&amp;B album than recent releases from Blaque\u2019s millennium-era peers such as Ciara or Usher. Rodney \u201cDarkchild\u201d Jerkins and Linda Perry contribute, and Missy Elliott brings an out-of-the-box spirit to five tracks. The album closes with Her Name Is, a tribute to Left Eye. \u201cLisa was so much to us,\u201d says Williams. \u201cShe was a true friend, a big sister, a mother figure. For us to lose her at such an early time in our career was just a devastating blow.\u201d Blaque are now planning a string of US shows as a two-piece, as well as brand new music soon. \u201cTwenty years ago, you had to have a major label behind you,\u201d says Williams. \u201cNow, artists are able to put their careers in their own hands. Shamari and I are really interested in taking the independent route.\u201d In a career marked by label disputes and personal tragedy, Blaque have weathered the knocks and are ready to thrive again. \u201cI wanna make sure that we continue to keep Natina\u2019s legacy alive,\u201d says DeVoe. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this for Natina and Lisa.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
