Her family paid tribute to her on Sunday as a \u201cfunny, kind, positive influence at the centre of many people\u2019s lives\u201d. \u201cShe had a wonderful sense of mischievous fun and was generous to the point of always wanting to see the best in all people,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cShe was intent on living life to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge, enabling her to be the best she could be. \u201cSaskia had a great passion for providing invaluable support to victims of criminal injustice, which led her to the point of recently applying for the police graduate recruitment programme, wishing to specialise in victim support. \u201cThis is an extremely painful time for the family. Saskia will leave a huge void in our lives and we would request that our privacy is fully respected.\u201d Jones was named a day after Jack Merritt, 25, was identified by his father as the other person killed by Usman Khan in his knife attack at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall on Friday. They had been attending an event to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Learning Together, a prison-based education project. Merritt\u2019s father, David, described his son, who was a course coordinator for the project, as \u201ca beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog\u201d. \u201cJack spoke so highly of all the people he worked with and he loved his job,\u201d he added. Prof Loraine R Gelsthorpe, the director of the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge, where both victims had studied, paid tribute to them in a statement on Sunday. She said Saskia\u2019s \u201cwarm disposition and extraordinary intellectual creativity was combined with a strong belief that people who have committed criminal offences should have opportunities for rehabilitation. \u201cThough she completed her MPhil in criminology in 2018, her determination to make an enduring and positive impact on society in everything she did led her to stay in contact with the Learning Together community. They valued her contributions enormously and were inspired by her determination to push towards the good.\u201d She said everyone at the institute would \u201cmiss Jack\u2019s quiet humour and rigorous intellect\u201d, adding: \u201cHis determined belief in rehabilitation inspired him to join the institute as a staff member to work in the Learning Together research team after completing his MPhil in criminology in 2017. \u201cJack\u2019s passion for social and criminal justice was infectious. He was deeply creatively and courageously engaged with the world, advocating for a politics of love. He worked tirelessly in dark places to pull towards the light.\u201d Gelsthorpe also thanked other members of the Learning Together community \u201cwho bravely risked their own lives to hold off the attacker until the police arrived\u201d. Olivia Smith, a lecturer in criminology at Loughborough university, said: \u201cSaskia Jones was one of those students makes you so proud to be in this job. I\u2019m so sorry that the world won\u2019t get to see what she could have achieved. She was one of a kind and loved justice, she would have been a force for good and I\u2019m so sorry for us all that we\u2019ve lost her.\u201d Cambridge University\u2019s vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen J Toope, said on Sunday: \u201cI am devastated to learn that among the victims of the London Bridge attack were staff and alumni of the University of Cambridge, taking part in an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme. \u201cWhat should have been a joyous opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this unique and socially transformative programme, hosted by our Institute of Criminology, was instead disrupted by an unspeakable criminal act.\u201d He added: \u201cOur university condemns this abhorrent and senseless act of terror. Our condolences, our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families.\u201d Floral tributes have been laid on the south side of London Bridge and hundreds attended a service on Sunday at Southwark Cathedral for the victims of the attack. The cathedral, which is next to London Bridge, was put into lockdown during the attack with members of the public taking refuge in its walls. For many it brought back memories of the terror attack at nearby Borough Market in 2017. The NHS said one of the people injured in the attack had been allowed to return home and two others remained in a stable condition. Dr Vin Diwakar, the medical director for the NHS in London, paid tribute to hospital and ambulance staff. \u201cOur thoughts remain with the families and friends of those who sadly lost their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the people injured in the London Bridge incident has now been able to return home. Two people remain in a stable condition and continue to receive expert care in hospital. \u201cWhile the NHS is now dealing with immediate physical injuries, the psychological impact of such events sometimes only comes to light in the days and weeks afterwards.\u201d PA Media contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
