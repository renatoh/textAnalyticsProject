A sleepy, crumbling hamlet of fewer than a dozen Israeli residents surrounded by sun-parched fields of crisp hay. Weeds punctuate the cracked asphalt of a basketball court, its rusted hoops leaning at angles. This hinterland settlement in the Golan Heights has become the next recipient of the Trump brand empire. Built on land captured from Syria in a war fought half a century ago, it is some of the most contentious real estate on the planet. Israel\u2019s claim to the strategic volcanic plateau that overlooks Lebanon, Jordan and the Sea of Galilee has been rebuked by the UN and never internationally recognised. For decades, Israeli settlement in the Golan Heights had been globally shunned. That was until Trump heard about it and recognised Israel\u2019s claim with a tweet. To thank his benefactor, Benjamin Netanyahu said he would name a settlement after the US president. On Sunday, the Israeli prime minister and his cabinet convened in the tiny outpost for the inauguration of its new title, emblazoned on a giant billboard: \u201cRamat Trump\u201d \u2013 or Trump Heights. The US president thanked Netanyahu with another tweet: Plans have begun to extend the hamlet of Bruchim, first established in 1991 but almost forgotten until now. Haim Rokach, head of the Israeli Golan regional council, hopes that it will eventually comprise 400 houses, with construction of a first phase of 100 homes set to begin later this year. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s decision to build a new place in the Golan Heights is a revolution. We were thirsty for that,\u201d said the mayor. A range of name suggestions were submitted to a government committee for approval. Other possibilities had included Neve Trump (Trump\u2019s Oasis) and Ruakh Trump (Trump\u2019s Soul). Local rights groups estimate up to 130,000 Syrians fled or were forced from their homes in the 1967 war and have not been allowed to return. Many of their farms and villages have since been demolished, and the ruins of stone houses can still be seen across the fields. Parts of the Golan remain mined. Israel\u2019s government offered citizenship to the few thousand remaining Syrians, mostly Druze Arabs, but most reject it, opting instead for resident status. To entrench itself, Israel has built military bases and established a civilian foothold of about 20,000 settlers, who have wineries, cattle farms and a small tourism industry. Many of the residents are similar to those who took Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. Some believe Jewish people have biblical rights to the land but have always known they could be removed in a peace agreement. That almost happened in 2000, when Syria\u2019s then president, Hafez al-Assad, and Israel appeared close to a deal, although it collapsed at the last moment. Trump\u2019s recognition takes away the fear of handing the Golan Heights back to Damascus, said Rokach, who has lived there for 35 years. \u201cAll the Golan residents, all of them, they have a feeling of release.\u201d The US decision has led to a wave of donations and investment from sympathetic Americans, he added. Republican party megadonors Miriam and Sheldon Adelson \u2013 known for financial support for Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank \u2013 have plans to build a 200-room hotel, he said. It does not bother Rokach that Trump is a controversial figure. \u201cFor that, there is the American legal system. I judge president Trump on what he does for Israel. And I think we have a great friend,\u201d he said. The local mayor is thinking in terms of decades and centuries, not presidential terms. People only remember one thing about Arthur Balfour, he said of the British foreign secretary who signed the famous 1917 Balfour Declaration that gave UK backing to establishing a Jewish homeland in mandate Palestine. \u201cDoes anyone remember his past? If he was drinking? Nobody remembers,\u201d said Rokach. \u201cIf Theresa May will build me a village, I will call it Theresa May.\u201d Residents of Bruchim and the village of Kela next door also appear optimistic. Menachem Ender, a tour guide from Kela, said Trump is \u201ca personality in doubt\u201d but he added, \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019m not objective \u2026 I care about my country, about my future.\u201d In Bruchim, one of the few residents, an organic farmer, is excited about the potential influx of people. \u201cWhat we dream for, is for it to become a special place,\u201d said Naomi Ish Shalom, talking in her small plot where she grows olives, apples, and peaches. She has lived here since 1992 among the eucalyptus trees, and now with goats, chickens and a couple of dogs. But as the Golan was never fully developed, her three sons left. \u201cThey have nothing here to really come back to,\u201d she said. The remnants of Syria and wars fill the hamlet. The path that leads to Bruchim has minefield warnings on both sides \u2013 the land has been demined but the paperwork to have it approved for use is pending. In the middle of the community, a Syrian army bunker remains standing. Israel\u2019s hold on the Golan has had domestic opposition too, from those who feel it has created further antagonism in the region. In 1973, Syria fought to retake it but failed and remains in a frozen state of conflict with Israel. Ish Shalom hopes Trump\u2019s recognition will end the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s deciding. And that, in a way, stops all the talking,\u201d she said. Along with his Golan decision, Trump has acceded to a list of Israel\u2019s longstanding demands regarding the Palestinians and its Arab neighbours that were long considered one-sided, politically detrimental and potentially explosive by previous administrations. He has cut US aid to Palestinians, cut diplomatic ties and declared the city of Jerusalem \u2013 part of which Palestinians claim \u2013 as Israel\u2019s capital. In gratitude, the city\u2019s mayor named a roundabout in Trump\u2019s honour. The US president said he made the Golan decision after getting a quick history lesson from Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, and David Friedman, the pro-settlement ambassador to Israel and former Trump bankruptcy lawyer. Friedman, who attended the inauguration on Sunday, reacted like a \u201cwonderful, beautiful baby\u201d getting what he wanted, Trump said. Ish Shalom hopes Trump will visit his namesake soon. \u201cI think it will mean something for him, that there is a place in the world, far away from the States, with his name,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
