Will Mesut \u00d6zil start after showing his worth against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup? It feels like a no-brainer. Emery\u2019s side have been crying out for his ability to create something from nothing to feed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. One decision that has been made is that Granit Xhaka will play no part in proceedings. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo will hope the drama in north London continues so his side can go for six unbeaten after a rocky start.
