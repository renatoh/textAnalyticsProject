The combatants have \"turned the bodies of thousands of women and girls into a battleground\", according to Susan Lee, director of Amnesty International's Americas programme, after the publication of the charity's report on the issue. \"With this report,\" she said, \"we hope to give a voice to the thousands of women survivors whose experiences of sexual violence remain hidden behind a wall of silence fuelled by discrimination and impunity.\" The report, based on interviews with victims, said the warring parties had labelled women \"military targets\" for having relationships or fraternising with the enemy. \"Surveillance is regularly carried out on women and teenage girls to ensure compliance, and rape is sometimes used to punish the individuals concerned and to send out a general warning to the female population,\" the report said. According to the report - titled, Colombia: Scarred Bodies, Hidden Crimes: Sexual Violence Against Women in the Armed Conflict - those most vulnerable are peasant and indigenous women, as well as refugees. According to statistics from the ministry of social protection, 36% of internally displaced women have been forced to have sex with men they did not know. The 40-year-old conflict is pitting two leftist rebel armies against rightwing paramilitaries and the government. Kidnap victims of the country's largest rebel army, the Farc, are also raped by their captors. Often women are abducted by groups solely to provide sexual services to combatants, said the report. The report describes instances of rape, torture and mutilation of women during incursions of paramilitary groups in rural towns. According to one testimony from an indigenous leader, paramilitaries cut the breasts off young women \"to make their presence felt\". The report also accuses the US-backed government security forces for sexual assaults on women in areas where they are deployed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
