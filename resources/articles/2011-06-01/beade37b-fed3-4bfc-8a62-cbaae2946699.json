My last interest in a Lakeland butterfly was being scared witless by the Hitchcock-type film, The Clouded Yellow, in which Jean Simmons and Trevor Howard clung petrified to the slippery rocks of Sourmilk Gill above Borrowdale as a police helicopter hovered overhead. My witlessness was still in evidence last week. I did not find the chocolate-coloured butterfly fluttering in its colonies, though I did make other discoveries. Everywhere was a mosaic of thyme-scented freshness with every contour climbed: sedges (or \"sieves\" as the farmers call them), reeds in clusters by the track, tiny yellow flowers, carpets of a minuscule white blossom, meadow buttercups, mat grasses and emerald turf. And here were pairs of brown butterflies called, I believe, the small heath, with a distinctive eyespot on the wing, observed when they came to rest, wings always closed. Then I spotted the view. So intent had I been on observing the surrounding mosaic, I had ignored the vista behind. The panorama from this eyrie up the silvery length of Wastwater towards the triangular citadel of Great Gable, standing four-square in the background, was electrifying. I duly photographed the scene, then checked my notes. \"The mountain ringlet,\" they read, \"is also found on Hartsop Dodd, Kidsty Pike, Raise, Cold Pike ('where it is strong above Wrynose Pass but curiously has never crossed the road to the Coniston range') and Irton Fell.\" Irton Fell! It was here I realised my mistake. I had concentrated my endeavours on Irton Pike in the opposite direction and, alas, it was presumably too lowly for this elusive butterfly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
