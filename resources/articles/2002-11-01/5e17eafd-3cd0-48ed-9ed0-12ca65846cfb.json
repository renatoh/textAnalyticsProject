When the basic hotel cost - as well as all the mandatory extras such as equipment rental and lift pass - are taken into consideration, the price you pay for snow fun is a hefty one. But if personal privacy is a dispensable commodity, then the swanky hostel is the new budget option in alpine accommodation. Austria Gasthof Sch\u00f6neck, Hopfgarten The low-key village of Hopfgarten has a long-established Antipodean following, which is probably why Contiki, the dedicated tour operator for 18-35s, virtually claims as its own this small resort in the 93-lift SkiWelt circuit. The accommodation at Gasthof Sch\u00f6neck is more exalted than a simple hostel, with two to four people sharing a room with bathroom. People travelling on their own are more than welcome and can share one of the same-sex rooms. Travel is by coach between London and Hopfgarten, and facilities at the Gasthof include internet access, as well as a sauna and a popular apr\u00e8s-ski bar. Where to book: Contiki (020-8290 6422, contiki.com). One week's B&amp;B from \u00a3229pp sharing a triple or quad room, including coach travel.

The Mountain Centre (TMC), Les Gets and La Tania The Trois Vall\u00e9es boasts 200 lifts and 600km of trails, and some of the most expensive accommodation in the Alps. La Tania is a modern but pleasant village offering a good alternative base for the price-conscious, unlike its expensive neighbours, Courchevel and M\u00e9ribel. In among the Scandinavian-style chalets at La Tania are two new wooden chalets for backpackers that sleep 36 and 33, respectively, in attractive pine-clad two- to four-bedded rooms. Nine of the 13 rooms have en suite shower rooms, and the accommodation is ski-in, ski-out. The difference between these and standard tour operator-run chalets is their flexibility: you can arrive and depart on any day of the week and decide on the day whether you want to eat in or out in the evening. The chalets have TV rooms, communal lounges, internet access, games rooms, in-house ski hire shop, and offer free tea and coffee. TMC runs a similar operation in Les Gets in the Portes du Soleil, but in this case the property is a converted hotel opposite the lifts and a five-minute walk from the resort centre. The accommodation sleeps 45 with all en-suite shower rooms. Where to book: The Mountain Centre (01273 897525, themountaincentre.com). From \u00a319pp per night B&amp;B, including linen.

North America The Bunkhouse, Jackson Hole, Wyoming Jackson Hole has one of the longest vertical drops in the US, and the skiing takes place on two adjoining mountains. Of these, Rendezvous Mountain is considered to be one of the last wild frontiers of macho mountainside. However, it can be difficult to find low-priced accommodation at this exclusive destination. One exception is the Bunkhouse, which is cheap, clean, and only one block from the main square in the cowboy town of Jackson.

Switzerland The Bunker, Verbier A world away from the town's expensive chalets and hotels is the Bunker, which must be one of the safest places on earth to stay in. This is a Cold War atomic shelter that was transformed into a backpackers' hostel in 1999. It has 120 beds divided between four large dormitories, and to make up for the lack of daylight, the walls are garishly decorated with graffiti. The Bunker is part of the Verbier Sports Centre, which offers swimming pools, whirlpools, ice-skating rink, skate park and internet access. A cool bar, the Verbier Beach Caf\u00e9 restaurant, is next door. Bring your own sleeping bag.

The Riders Palace, Laax Flims and Laax share a ski area with 220km of piste in the Graubunden region. Of the two, Laax has the cheapest accommodation and the younger clientele, which might explain the extraordinary Riders Palace - the world's first high-tech Sony-sponsored hotel for snowboarders. It has 312 beds in 70 rooms and four price scales, from backpacker kitsch to boutique bedrooms with Philippe Starck-designed chrome bathrooms. The Back to Basic rooms each contain five to seven beds.
