Because just imagine the embarrassment if someone went and asked her, and she wasn't, as said email puts it, \"in a position to say, 'Of course I belong to my local library, and it's wonderful'\". Good skills! \u00b7 Next, Reuters reports that when police broke into a flat in the German town of Kaiserslautern at the weekend following complaints of a nasty smell on the stairs and a mountain of mail, they fully expected to find a corpse. Instead, it was \"a tenant with stinky feet, asleep in bed next to a pile of foul-smelling laundry\". Ouch. We've all been there, haven't we? \u00b7 Bit late, this one, obviously, but as you will undoubtedly have noticed, what matters to this column is Truth, not Topicality. When St Tony bade farewell to the house the other week, his closing words were: \"That is that.\" Eerily, it seems those are exactly the same words used by the Cat in the Hat after he's cleared up the mess he's made. In fact, add a red hat and bow tie and the two would be indistinguishable. It's a thought, you have to admit. \u00b7 Spotted in the Lamb pub in London's Lamb's Conduit Street the other night, a man in a T-shirt bearing the legend \"Never trust a squirrel\". Sadly, writes alert reader Chris Coates, \"I wasn't able to ask him where he'd got it. But the signs are good: you are not alone!\" So, thankfully, it would seem. \u00b7 In further news of Mrs Hodge (and, coincidentally, of open-air opera on the lives of our nation's leaders - see last week), we hear she was on her way to see Rossini's La Donna del Lago at Garsington when No 10 called. Whether the opera's plot - feuding Scottish politicians and dark deception - was in any way relevant, though, we fear it might still be too early to say. \u00b7 All this talk of an alleged off-court tendresse between Wimbledon's mixed doubles champs Jelena Jankovic and our very own Jamie Murray is clearly nonsense: he's invited her to Scotland for Christmas. Arf. \u00b7 Not as dull as everyone says they are, Ali Campbell's diaries. In April 2000, we find Robin Cook reporting to cabinet from an EU-Africa summit in Cairo. Colonel Gadafy wore painted nails, and Robert Mugabe had announced that Peter Hain was the gay lover of Peter Tatchell. \"Hain is taking it calmly,\" the ginger-haired rebel noted cheerily. \"Tatchell is furious.\" \u00b7 We are indebted to China Central TV, next, for the exciting news that authorities in Chongqing are submitting an application to Guinness World Records to have their city's brand-new, four-storey, one thousand-loo public convenience officially recognised as the world's largest. Says spokesman Lu Xiaoqing of the edifice, which features Egyptian facades, piped music, television screens and uniquely shaped urinals: \"We are spreading toilet culture. After they use bathroom, people will be very happy.\" We certainly would be. \u00b7 Not that the party's losing its way or anything, but Ealing Lib Dems warn that their Ealing Southall byelection campaign HQ is \"on an industrial estate, on private land. For this reason, many sat nav systems are directing people to the wrong place. Please check that the destination your system offers you ... tallies with the map on our website\". Fine work. \u00b7 Hard to know in which subject that remarkable polymath the Rt Hon Lord Goldsmith QC could truly be said to specialise, but we suppose financial economic crime - on which he is due to address an upcoming Chatham House conference - might just be it. \u00b7 Finally, Castle Hill police station in Sidney boasts a Sergeant Sargent. His wife, also a police officer, is Constable Sargent. Bravo! diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
