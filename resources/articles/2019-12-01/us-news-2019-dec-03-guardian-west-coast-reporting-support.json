Over the last year Guardian US has strengthened our commitment to reporting from the west coast. This is where many of America\u2019s challenges are being felt first \u2013 and worst: the climate crisis, homelessness, raging inequality, the ethical conundrums of big data and big tech. But it is also a place that shows America how an alternative political universe of social democracy can thrive and where demographic change is a force for hope, not hate. Last year readers contributed more than $1m to the Guardian\u2019s year-end campaign, money that helped support and expand our west coast reporting operations. Here\u2019s some of the journalism that support funded and the impact it had: Now through January, we hope to raise $1.5m to fund our journalism in 2020. With your help, we\u2019ll continue to fight for the progressive values we hold dear \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. Please consider making a contribution. And as always, thanks for reading."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
