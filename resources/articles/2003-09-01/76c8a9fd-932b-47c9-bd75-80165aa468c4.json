That's the fact that three of the key nations - Samoa, Tonga and Fiji - will not be taking their best teams because they can't afford to pay the players. It's a situation that will devalue the World Cup, and it reflects poorly on rugby in general. It will be frustrating to watch those teams getting beaten, and wonder how they would have performed if guys like Epi Taione, Simon Raiwalui and Trevor Leota had been there. What's doubly frustrating is that, in the past, we've been able to watch fine players like Inga Tuigamala in the World Cup. Not this time. It's a crazy situation: their best players come over, and improve their level by playing in the Premiership, and become known outside their own nations. Then they don't get the chance to perform on the biggest stage of all. In competitive terms, it devalues the whole event. I'm in total sympathy with the players, of course. It's not their fault they are where they are. The economic arguments speak for themselves. There's even an absurd side to it: some players at Saracens, for example, have contracts that ensure they will still get paid if they go, others don't. There are solutions of course, but they are unpalatable. First, why not use some of the money generated by the World Cup to compensate the clubs if the national federations don't have the funds to do so? After all, the World Cup is supposed to generate money for the developing rugby nations. What's the point in giving them a slice of the cash, as we do at present, while denying them the chance to put up their best teams? Do we really want Samoa to revert to amateur status, as is rumoured they might after the World Cup? Second, harmonise the calendar. It's crazy to have national-level rugby going on at the same time as the World Cup. That's what has created the position with the English-based players from Samoa, Fiji and Tonga, but the underlying reason is that the World Cup is simply scheduled at the wrong time. It doesn't happen in football: why should it happen in rugby? If the World Cup had taken place in August and September, say, teams would still have had time to prepare after the full season, and the Premiership could have started a little late. As it is, for the northern hemisphere teams at least, you could argue that three months' build-up is too long. By the time they get back from the World Cup, some of the players will have been away for five months, give or take a few short \"windows\". Expect lawsuits from some of the wives and children. Perhaps it's time to think again about harmonising the northern and southern hemisphere seasons. There would be plenty of arguing about it, but we'd get used to it. Summer rugby might be just the thing in England: think of the potential for beer sales. And sometimes the English summer isn't that different from the English winter anyway: there will still be dank days when Gloucester can stick the ball up their jumpers. Seriously, though, outside English rugby, there are plenty of anomalies involving the South Seas players as well. I don't understand how Samoans can be made to sign contracts for New Zealand provinces that forbid them to play for their own nation, but then, after three years, they can play for the All Blacks. There's a feudal side to it - it looks as if, in some quarters, the aim is to neutralise another country and simultaneously strengthen the national side - and it's self-defeating. Where's the interest in international competition if there is no competition? I suppose we have to put this farce into some kind of perspective. It took us 100 years to get a World Cup in rugby, so it will take a while to sort out the finer details. Things always seem to progress slowly in rugby. Ten years ago, we were told weight training was bad for us, now we do more weight training than rugby practice. In France they tell you that sandwiches are bad for rugby players, in England the fitness coaches say they are fine. It sounds flippant, but I have a point: there's a complete lack of harmony in the sport, and it needs to be addressed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
