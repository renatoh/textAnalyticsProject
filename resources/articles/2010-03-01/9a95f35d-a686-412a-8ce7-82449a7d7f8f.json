Calling it a \"critical moment\" for the future of Greece, the Finn urged the socialist government to reinforce the unpopular cuts it has already announced with \"additional measures\" to tame a credit crisis that has reverberated across the euro area. \"It is of paramount importance for the Greek people to get their public finances back on a sustainable path,\" said Rehn after holding high-level talks in Athens. \"The risks related to macroeconomic and market developments are now materialising [and] additional measures are necessary \u2026 In parallel, emphasis should be given to structural reforms aimed at regaining the country's economic competitiveness,\" said Rehn. The eurozone's weakest economy, Greece is saddled with some \u20ac300bn of debt, more than 120% of its GDP. At 12.7% its public deficit as a percentage of GDP is four times higher than that permitted by the EU. The socialists, who inherited the crisis when they were elected to power last October, have pledged to trim the deficit to below 3% by 2012. Looking unusually solemn as he broke the news at the end of a highly anticipated 24-hour visit, the EU economics chief said extra measures were essential if the government was to not only reassure markets but meet its stated target of reducing its public deficit by four percentage points. A team of EU inspectors visiting Athens last week concluded that under current measures Greece would only be able to cut its deficit-to-GDP ratio by two percentage points at most, partly because the country is also suffering its first recession in 16 years. Greece's parlous economy has prompted a crisis of confidence in financial markets. Amid fears of the crisis spilling over to Spain, Italy and Portugal, the European single currency is facing its biggest test since its birth 12 years ago. Refusing to be drawn on whether a \u20ac25bn rescue package was being crafted by eurozone governments and banks to assist Greece, Rehn insisted the EU had the \"ways and means\" to ensure the financial stability of the euro area was safeguarded. \"The euro area is ready to take determined and coordinated action to ensure the stability of the euro area,\" he said. \"The Commission has put in place the framework of coordinating such action.\" If Athens thought it had any room to negotiate with the EU, that thought was effectively dispelled tonight. The EU commissioner's pronouncement now puts prime minister George Papandreou in the difficult position of having to decide what further measures to take. Before Rehn's arrival, TV commentators described the \"bombardment\" of measures as \"shocking to Greeks\". Addressing his cabinet today, the prime minister was at pains to prepare Greeks for the inevitable. \"We will not let Greece slip further and sink completely. Today we ask men and women to enlist in our common cause to save our country and the overwhelming majority of our citizens are willing to do it despite the price and despite the burden.\" But while Papandreou has skillfully persuaded Greeks of the need for tough fiscal policies since inheriting the crisis, it remains to be seen if militant unionists, already fiercely opposed to any measures, will accept the notion of more. Under pressure from EU peers and market speculation which has seen Greek borrowing costs soar, the government announced public-sector spending cuts and tax hikes as part of a three-year stability and growth programme it presented to the EU Commission in January. Additional measures including a wage and hiring freeze and levy on fuel were introduced in February. Senior government members including deputy prime minister Theodore Pangalos who is believed to have expressed his disquiet to Rehn yesterday, are said to be furious that the Commission allowed Greek finances to flounder so badly under Athens's previous conservative government. One insider with close connections to the government said: \"We are not saying that measures aren't needed but if the goalposts keep moving all the time it makes [the implementation of] measures very difficult. Greece needs a break from the markets and the goalposts to stop being moved so we can go about the business of implementing measures.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
