The full text of the 6,000-page document was released on Thursday night, and already groups are expressing concern over the sparse attention given to climate change in the deal. \u201cIt seems to me remarkable that the environmental chapter in the Trans-Pacific Partnership doesn\u2019t even mention the phrase climate change,\u201d University of Queensland intellectual property expert Matthew Rimmer told the ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like Voldemort in the Harry Potter series, it\u2019s a taboo phrase in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d But Robb has defended the deal, which has taken years to negotiate. \u201cIn the environmental area, now it\u2019s very explicit on those issues. It does provide safeguards, the best safeguards that have ever been provided in any agreement,\u201d Robb told ABC Radio on Friday morning. \u201cWe [Australia] have been successful in leading the charge in getting significant carve-outs which preclude public policy in environment areas from being subject to litigation.\u201d Of particular concern to groups opposed to the TPP is the inclusion of a clause that makes it possible for foreign investors to sue governments if they think domestic laws are harmful to their investments. Robb acknowledged that the clause, known as investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS), has been a sticking point, but said that Australia had negotiated a good deal. \u201cAustralia has been at the forefront of tackling this issue, that the investor state dispute settlement mechanism is not used and abused by groups in other countries to ... litigate against particular countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been obvious all along where were the sensitive areas and I\u2019m very confident that we have addressed those and protected issues that were of great concern to various groups within the Australian community.\u201d The Australian Free Trade and Investment Network is not convinced. The group has been sceptical of the ISDS clause, and of the TPP more broadly. \u201cThe general \u2018safeguards\u2019 in the text [regarding ISDS] are qualified, and similar to those in other recent agreements which have not prevented cases against health and environmental laws,\u201d coordinator of the network, Patricia Ranald, said. \u201cThey do not address the fundamental flaws of an unfair international tribunal system which has no independent judiciary, no precedents and no appeals.\u201d Ranald pointed to a legal dispute between tobacco company Philip Morris and the Australian government over plain packaging of cigarettes, which the company argues limits its right to intellectual property by removing its ability to brand its products. Robb said that \u201cpredictable\u201d opponents of the trade deal have not had a chance to properly study the expansive document. \u201cThey don\u2019t do themselves any favours, much less the nation, by jumping at shadows, peddling lines they\u2019ve been peddling for years without a decent look at what\u2019s been negotiated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been negotiated over many, many years. We were aware from day one [of] the major areas of sensitivity [and] we have spent literally, you know, hundreds of hours on these areas.\u201d Labor would carefully analyse the text before committing to it, trade spokeswoman Penny Wong said. \u201cLegitimate concerns have been raised by many Australians about the content of this agreement. The government and Andrew Robb must explain the detail of the agreement, rather than attacking those raising concerns as anti-trade,\u201d she said. An inquiry by the joint standing committee on treaties would allow business, experts and the public to have their say on the deal, she said. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, told reporters on Friday the text of the deal \u201cconfirms our worst fears\u201d. \u201cWe are handing over control to unelected, unaccountable foreign multinational corporations, to give them the power to sue governments for protecting peoples\u2019 health and protecting the environment,\u201d he said. The TPP still needs to be ratified by the 12 countries that have reached an agreement on the deal: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has welcomed the deal, labelling it \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cfar-reaching\u201d. \u201cIt has the potential to reduce costs across global supply chains, provide for predictable common rules for investment and services and open previously restricted markets for our goods and services,\u201d the chamber said. It argued that releasing the text before the deal is ratified allows stakeholders to express concern to parliamentarians before the deal is formally signed off. \u201cWe congratulate the government and negotiators on their efforts to advance trade liberalisation across our region and hope that the presence of the TPP can inspire the governments of the world to continue embracing further liberalisation,\u201d the group said. Consumer group Choice wants the text of the document to be analysed by independent experts. \u201cThe TPP will impact nearly every part of the Australian economy \u2013 it covers financial services, food, medicines and how our public services operate. It is too big and too important to simply wave through without an assessment of what we\u2019re trading away,\u201d campaign manager Erin Turner said. \u201cChoice urges the government to commit to a full cost-benefit analysis by the Productivity Commission of the TPP before Australia signs on to the complex new rules in this hefty document.\u201d Ratification of the trade deal could hit a snag in the United States, as the country enters its campaign to elect a new president. Barack Obama, who is about to enter his last year in office and has a lot riding on the deal, has strongly urged Congress to pass it. He wrote an online piece outlining how the deal would affect American workers. \u201cThe TPP means that America will write the rules of the road in the 21st century,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen it comes to Asia, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing regions, the rulebook is up for grabs. And if we don\u2019t pass this agreement \u2013 if America doesn\u2019t write those rules \u2013 then countries like China will.\u201d \u201cThat would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world,\u201d he said. The American nurses union, National Nurses United, has warned that patent rules favour big pharmaceutical companies and therefore limit the availability of cheaper generic drugs. \u201cThat could be a death sentence for countless patients in need of affordable medications around the world,\u201d executive director of the union, RoseAnn DeMoro, said. Robb said that there was a \u201ca lot of politics being played\u201d in the US over the TPP, due to posturing ahead of an election. But he remained confident that the deal would pass Congress due to its importance to the US economy and its standing in the region."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
