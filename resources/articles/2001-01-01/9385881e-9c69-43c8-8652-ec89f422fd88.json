The Northern Ireland secretary went on TV last night to deny improper lobbying on behalf of Srichand Hinduja, the oldest of three brothers facing allegations of corruption in an arms scandal in their native India. The family is worth an estimated \u00a32bn. But in a day of shifting explanations it was confirmed that a \"fleeting telephone conversation\" between Mr Mandelson and the then immigration minister, Mike O'Brien, had taken place in June 1998. It was that month that the Hinduja Foundation offered - on June 17 - to underwrite the \u00a33m cost of the Millennium Dome's faith zone. The coincidence prompted Opposition MPs to accuse the minister of selling a passport in return for what eventually turned out to be a \u00a31m contribution to the faith zone, formally announced in October 1998. Last night's fresh confusion arose because Mr Mandelson's spokesman told the Observer categorically at the weekend that the minister played no direct role in Mr Hinduja's passport application and the incident came after dome funding negotiations were over. \"The [passport] matter was dealt with by [his] private secretary,\" said a statement - a claim repeated by Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair's spokesman, on Monday. Last night Mr Mandelson said: \"There is no question of my forgetting about anything. I was not asked until today.\" Asked why a Downing Street spokesman yesterday claimed he could not remember the call, Mr Mandelson said: \"You will have to ask them that.\" In June 1998 Mr Mandelson was the cabinet office minister in charge of making a success of the dome. He moved to the DTI the following month and was forced to resign that December when the Guardian disclosed his \u00a3374,000 home loan from Geoffrey Robinson. According to his own version he was asked by the Hindujas - whom he had met several times - how the newly-announced change in government policy towards passport applications might affect Srichand Hinduja's chances. \"The answer was that I hadn't the foggiest idea,\" he told friends yesterday. Most backbench MPs said yesterday that at this point they would have referred the inquirer to the home office - unless he or she was their own constituent. Mr Mandelson's problem is that he placed a call to Mr O'Brien. \"The trouble is that Peter speaks for Tony - if he makes a call he's saying 'Tony wants this passport',\" one minister said yesterday. Mr Mandelson said yesterday: \"There was no question of me getting any preferential treatment for anyone who wanted a British passport, after all no application had even been made by an individual.\" He expressed no view to Mr O'Brien on Mr Hinduja's suitability either way, he said, although Hinduja sources spoke last night of getting an encouraging \"steer\". The tycoon applied in October 1998, just after the \u00a31m dome gift. By the time his passport was granted in March 1999 Mr Mandelson was in disgrace. He played no further role, he insists. A six month turn-around is three times the usual speed, experts say. Mr Hinduja - whose brother, Gopichand, was granted British citizenship in 1997 - had applied for a UK passport in 1990, but had been turned down because he had not lived in Britain long enough. An Indian court last week granted the brothers bail while corruption charges are investigated. But they were refused permission to leave the country. The Tories described it as an \"error of judgment\" to get even slightly involved in a passport application from a non-constituent - and their party chairman, Michael Ancram, insisted there were still \"very serious questions\" to answer. Downing Street and the NIO did not help their case by offering conflicting accounts of what led to yesterday's retraction at Mr Campbell's daily briefing for reporters. The prime minister's spokesman explained: \"Yesterday I repeated a line from Sunday that Peter's sole involvement was a call from his private secretary to the Home Office, which was Peter's recollection. But yesterday Peter's office was able to look at it in further detail.\" The record showed Mr Mandelson's private secretary did set up a call to Mr O'Brien. Mr Mandelson suggests he instigated the trawl of the record and realised the error when he read the daily summary of Mr Campbell's briefing. Last night sources close to the Hindujas said Downing Street's statement had not contradicted their remarks. \"We asked the question [as to whether Srichand Hinduja's passport application could be resubmitted] and Peter Mandelson came back to us with a steer.\" Related articles 24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble 24.01.2001: Minister's year of living dangerously Timeline of the passport row 24.01.2001: Profile of Srichand Hinduja 21.01.2001: Mandelson helped Dome backer's bid for passport Cartoon Steve Bell on the passport row Talk about it What do you think?
