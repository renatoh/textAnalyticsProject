Ever since, science has struggled to express the laws of the universe in equations. It Must Be Beautiful is a celebration of the elegance and, yes, the beauty of these equations, with essays from distinguished scientists such as Robert May and John Maynard Smith. Physics features strongly, but there are also excellent pieces on the role of equations in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, in chaos theory and even in ecology. Mathematics is a language that many of us (to our shame) cannot understand. As Sir Roger Penrose admits in his essay on general relativity, many people are intimidated by equations. His advice is to skip the ones in this book and read on, returning later when you have grasped the concepts. As someone who struggled even with O-level maths, I found this advice invaluable. But it is certainly worth going back later and making the extra effort, for this is a book that can open your eyes to new worlds and new ways of seeing. Einstein, a great believer in the beauty of equations, spoke of the common ground between science and the arts in 1923: \"After a certain high level of technical skill is achieved, science and art tend to coalesce in aesthetics, plasticity and form. The greatest scientists are always artists as well.\" We all know about the great pioneers of modernism in the arts: Picasso, Woolf, Schoenberg. But few have more than a superficial grasp of what scientists such as Einstein, Planck and Niels Bohr were discovering at the same time. It Must Be Beautiful makes one thing clear: if you want to understand what was happening in the 20th century, then you cannot ignore the scientists - or their equations. In each of these essays an equation is lovingly unpacked and its hieroglyphs painstakingly explained for the layman - a word that invites comparisons with religion, perhaps justifiably, for many of these equations deal with fundamental questions about the universe. According to Graham Farmelo, head of science communication at the Science Museum, the \"poetry of science\" is embodied in its equations. Like a poem that concentrates and refines ideas into a concise form, so E=mc2 represents the most succinct yet universal expression of the link between energy and matter. For Farmelo, such equations are as beautiful as any work of art. Rilke defined beauty as \"the beginning of terror we're still just able to bear\". And there is terror in equations too, for it was E=mc2 that made possible the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. George Steiner, in his recent book The Grammars of Creation , wrote memorably of the \"wing-beat of the unknown\" at the heart of artistic creation. This, perhaps, contains a clue to the beauty of equations and poems: both offer the possibility of profound understanding, while at the same time underlining the ultimate complexity and mystery of the universe. One of the many compelling questions raised by this book is whether equations are invented or discovered. Are they created by extraordinary individuals, such as the game theorist John Nash, whose life story is told in the film A Beautiful Mind ? Or are equations written into the fabric of the universe, just waiting for a scientist to spot them and spell them out on the blackboard for all to see? Most scientists agree with the latter, which means (to paraphrase Stephen Hawking) that to know the mind of God you have to be a mathematician. And that is a sobering thought, not least for those in the arts who recoil from anything mathematical. It Must Be Beautiful is long overdue. For the mathematically challenged it is not an easy read, but for anyone interested in what science has to say about the universe, it is fascinating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
