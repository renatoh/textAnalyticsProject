Ronnie Irani is having the time of his life at the moment. Every time he picks up his bat, it seems, it is to send the ball scudding to the boundary. Put the ball in his hand and he conjures up wickets. His captaincy has been a major factor in Essex's rise from mediocre underachievers to a powerful force. In county cricket he is a considerable performer. Now, though, the stakes are raised. Irani, to his obvious delight (he launched into a series of Oscar-style thank-yous when congratulated before the televised toss in Chelmsford yesterday), has been selected in a 15-man squad for the NatWest tri- nation one-day international series, and it would be a curmudgeon who says that he has not earned some recognition. The death of Ben Hollioake and the demise of Craig White's bowling as an international force have opened up the path and there is a World Cup place in the offing. All of the team who played in the last Test, barring the injured Andy Caddick and Mark Butcher, have been chosen, which gives a one-day chance to Alex Tudor. Darren Gough and Paul Collingwood, integral contributors during the winter, have also been included although both are recovering from knee injuries of varying severity and may not make the first match in a week. If an assessment next Wednesday proves disappointing, both could be replaced. Predictably, Alec Stewart returns - he was always going to once Marcus Trescothick began keeping wicket in place of James Foster in New Zealand - James Kirtley is in with a remodelled action after a throwing controversy and the surprise is the inclusion of the Gloucestershire all-rounder Jeremy Snape, who performed well during the winter but does not figure regularly in his county's one-day side. He has been included largely as cover for Ashley Giles, whose back is giving him a bit of gyp at the moment. Of the 21 players used by England during the winter Mark Ramprakash, Owais Shah, Paul Grayson and White are surplus to requirements, Foster certainly would be if he was fit, Caddick is crocked and Hollioake, of course, no longer with us. England enjoyed some success in Zimbabwe and India before Christmas, but finished disappointingly in New Zealand. \"We felt we made some important strides during the winter,\" said the chairman of selectors David Graveney, \"but we are definitely reaching the conclusion that the best players should be playing in both forms of international cricket.\" Irani, probably, will not make the best XI, and there could be some conflict over his bowling role, which is with the new ball for Essex (although some flexible thinking here might accommodate that as well). \"He is in the form of his life,\" said Graveney. \"He has won five man-of-the-match awards and hit the fastest hundred. We are looking for characters, and finishers, those who can see games through. It is an area we have fallen down on in the past and he backs himself to win.\" There will need to be a significant improvement on the international form he displayed when given a run six years ago. Then Irani played 10 matches, at home against Pakistan and India, and three each in Zimbabwe and New Zealand. Seventy-eight runs in 10 innings, with scores of 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 4 and 0, do not promote happy memories and nor do four wickets at 61 apiece and an economy rate of about 4.5 an over. Should he play, and if Collingwood proves unfit he will get a chance, then it will be a test of temperament as much as anything. The inclusion of Kirtley may be viewed as provocative in some quarters given the controversy over the action of the Sri Lankan pace bowler Ruchira Perera this summer. Kirtley's action was reported in Zimbabwe last winter and he has undergone remedial work, as required by the England and Wales Cricket Board's bowling review group, with Bob Cottam. Meanwhile Mark Butcher's disciplinary hearing with the ECB tomorrow has been postponed because of his impending knee operation. The Surrey left-hander was due to appear at Lord's less than two hours after undergoing surgery, but the hearing will now take place some time in the next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
