In an online post addressed to Hargreaves customers, the chief executive, Chris Hill, said he was angry the situation was still unresolved and pledged to ratchet up the pressure on Woodford\u2019s investment house. \u201cWe will continue to put pressure on Woodford Investment Management to sell out of their unquoted stocks in the Woodford Equity Income Fund,\u201d Hill said. Those investments are harder to turn into cash to meet customer withdrawals. \u201cWe have also urged Woodford to consider alternative ways to release capital so that investors can get access to their money as soon as possible, while balancing the need to get a fair price for assets,\u201d he added. Hargreaves Lansdown refused to comment on what alternative measures could help Woodford return cash to clients. But one industry expert, who asked not to be named, said Woodford may be able to split the fund, separating the harder-to-sell assets from its listed stocks. The fund holding the listed stocks could then open to trading. \u201cIn the hedge fund world, funds sometimes create \u2018side pockets\u2019 where illiquid and hard-to-sell assets are segregated and ringfenced in a separate share class, so that the ongoing fund that is open to trading is separated from these assets,\u201d the industry insider said. \u201cAny gains from the sale or recovery of these assets would only go to those who were invested at the time the \u2018side pocket\u2019 was created.\u201d Other options suggested by investment experts could include Woodford funnelling his own money into the fund or taking out a loan to pay back investors. Earlier this week, Hargreaves Lansdown disclosed that more than 290,000 of the firm\u2019s clients \u2013 or about one in four of its total customer base \u2013 have been hit by Woodford\u2019s decision to halt withdrawals from the \u00a33.7bn Woodford Equity Income Fund on 3 June. The investment group has been criticised for promoting Woodford\u2019s fund on its Wealth 50 list of favourite investments, despite a string of bad bets that sparked a surge in redemptions and the fund\u2019s eventual suspension. It only removed the fund following that suspension and has since apologised to investors. Hargreaves has also waived its platform fee until the fund reopens, although Woodford has not reduced his management fees. \u201cWe are angered by the lack of resolution so far but remain actively engaged with the regulator, Woodford, Link and the Treasury select committee to ensure that all investors, not just those invested through Hargreaves Lansdown, are able to access their investment as soon as possible,\u201d Hill said in his post. Link is the fund\u2019s authorised administrator. A Woodford spokesman said the fund was still working on cutting its exposure to unquoted companies. \u201cThis strategy is ongoing. We recognise the concerns of Hargreaves Lansdown and all investors. We are actively engaged with the fund\u2019s authorised corporate director [Link] and focused on getting the portfolio in a position to resolve this situation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
