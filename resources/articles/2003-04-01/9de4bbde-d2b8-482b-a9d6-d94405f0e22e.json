But at the gates of Baghdad, the Americans hesitate. They could gamble that it's almost over, that the tanks could roar down the boulevards and reach the centre in 20 minutes. Or they could see the streets ahead as a trap, set to detonate weeks of murderous fighting in the rubble. Or they could do what the British are doing in Basra: nibble and probe, nibble again and probe deeper. And when they finally stand on the Tigris embankment, in the middle of Baghdad, what exactly will be over? Beheaded, this cobra-regime will take time to die. Saddam will not surrender, if he is alive. Sniping and suicide bombing will probably persist. Maybe the defenders of some cities - even Basra - will go on fighting. It is too easy to say that war ends when a capital city falls. What matters more is how a war is remembered. Iraqis will remember it with shame. If American and Britain are lucky - luckier than they deserve - Iraqis will recall this war as the final disaster brought on his country by Saddam Hussein. More probably, while delighted to be rid of his regime, they will think of the invasion as an act of aggression so completely unprovoked that only greed - 'they want our oil' - can explain it. Only if Iraq is gradually returned to genuine independence, free to control its oil and even to support the Palestinian cause in its foreign policy, will the shame begin to hurt less. The Arab world and the whole region will remember the war with rage and fear. The 1991 Kuwait campaign at least rescued an Arab country. This one feels like the First Crusade in a new series of Western invasions of the Muslim world. Who is the next target for 'liberation' - Iran, Syria? In the Middle East, they assume that 'reconstructed' Iraq will be either a garrisoned American satellite or a basket-case UN protectorate under World Bank influence. In any event, it will be full of foreign soldiers for a long time. The Palestinians will remember Saddam's fall as the beginning of their own solitary confinement. They were aware of the frightfulness of Saddam's rule, but they know that they have lost their only effective foreign ally. Now they stand alone against Israel and the US. Ariel Sharon's government in Israel hopes that isolation will cow the Palestinians. But the record suggests the opposite. Palestinians are already denouncing the Bush/Blair 'roadmap to peace' before they have read it. They assume it will show only one-way streets leading to the desert, and they are probably right. More important for the world is how America will remember this war. The course of the twenty-first century, containing the lives of all our children, depends on that. If it is perceived as a success, as a victory that obliterates all the criticism about chaotic war aims and the bulldozing of international opinion, then the tiny neo-conservative group which in effect has taken control of US policy through the Pentagon will be confirmed in power. Sooner rather than later, they will carry forward their programme of pre-emptive attack on 'potentially hostile' regimes and strike at another country. If this happens, we enter a century of violence and unpredictable counter-violence. The other possibility is that American opinion - the public and the policy-makers - will remain proud of their soldiers' victory but alarmed by the leaders who sent them to fight. It is difficult to remember a won war as a mistake. After all, it has taken nearly a century for the British to suspect that it was a blunder to fight the Boer War and maybe even the First World War. Nonetheless, the bizarre flavour of this George W. Bush administration - its 'with-us-or-against-us' extremism, its noisy internal vendettas, its queasy combination of evangelism with defence-contract sleaze and, finally, its astonishing rudeness to opponents and foreigners - all suggest that it may not last long in its present form. 'Dubya' may win a second term in the 2004 elections, but moderate 'wetness' could reassert itself before then. We have all misunderstood the past 20 years, the transition from Cold War to the 'new world disorder'. The time when the United States really dominated the world was then, not now. It was before the fall of the Soviet empire that American authority was unchallenged across most of the globe. But now the Cold War disciplines have gone. America finds the world uncontrollable, flinging down one challenge after another. American military power is colossal and still growing. But the political purpose that made it effective has been lost. Before 1989, America's role in the world was obvious: the containment and reduction of Communism. Today, the lonely superpower stands baffled, uncertain how to use its strength, defied by men with box-cutters, backstreet snipers and tens of millions of young demonstrators. This is why the 'Project for a New American Century' arose. This neo-conservative programme, hatched during Clinton's presidency by a group that included Rumsfeld, Wolfovitz and many others now guiding Bush, at least tried to provide American military supremacy with a clear political aim to replace anti-Communism. The trouble is that the Project, expressed in the new defence doctrine of pre-emptive war against states fancied to offer a threat to American security, cannot work in the twenty-first century world. It has too many opponents. The Europeans and the United Nations will try to tie down and restrain Gulliver with a thousand diplomatic threads. Others will resist with the gun, the bomb and the guerrilla conspiracy. The Project offers only bloodshed, hatred and international chaos. The American 'Imperium', which has been relatively benevolent until now, is entering its inevitable decline. The rest of the world - although it has not the slightest idea about how to replace it - must somehow manage that decline and prevent the Imperium foundering in a hundred years of slaughter. And how will Britain remember this war? With a flinch, like all the flinches with which our Government has followed President Bush down the road to Baghdad. Nobody will trust Tony Blair's judgment again. He gambled on being able to restrain Bush, and he failed. Nobody, even now, understands why this good man made such a mistake, still less why he became so emotionally committed to it. The damage he has done is spectacular. The public is horrified, the Labour Party split and demoralised, the prospects for the euro referendum devastated. Britain's historic pose as the grand intermediary between Europe and the United States is - for the moment - utterly discredited. London's defence-policy establishment continues to mouth about Britain's 'soft power' in world affairs. Where did that go, when the world turned hard? This should be a moment to rethink, without rancour, our relationship to the United States, especially our nuclear-weapons dependence. This relationship, weakened by fictions and evasions of the obvious, has now let Britain down. Europe, however, is still there and waiting for the final British commitment. Will this country take the chance? Or will we - flinching as usual - follow the Americans to the end of the Baghdad road: to win the war, and lose the peace?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
