The show will be based on the forthcoming book from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, whose work also inspired the 2012 film Game Change, which starred Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin and Ed Harris as John McCain, and won five Emmys. It will also share the same director, Jay Roach, typically known for his comedic work, including Austin Powers and Meet the Parents. Len Amato, president of HBO films, has said the film will \u201cvividly capture the most unique and impactful event in modern American politics\u201d. It will also continue Hanks\u2019 relationship with the channel; he produced Band of Brothers, The Pacific and another forthcoming series about the second world war. It\u2019s not the only show about Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory in the works. Ryan Murphy has already announced that the next season of American Horror Story will revolve around the election, while the team behind Zero Dark Thirty has announced a competing miniseries. Halperin and Heilemann will also be bringing a new series of their political documentary series The Circus to Showtime. It will cover the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency and starts on 19 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
