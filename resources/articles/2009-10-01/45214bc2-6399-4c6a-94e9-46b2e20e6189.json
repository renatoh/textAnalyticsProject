Over a quarter of a century since Schiff first taped these pieces for Decca, ECM (the Gramophone award-winning label of the year) has recorded him again in the ideal acoustic of the Neumarkt Reitstadel. Every note of the music is in Schiff's blood and, through his recent experience of conducting, he seems to have absorbed varied instrumental textures, breathtaking spontaneity, extrovert ornamentation, and whimsical rhythmic freedom. In an unusual order, starting with the cheerful Fifth Partita, the lyrical First, the imperious Second, and the exuberant Fourth lead to the infinite melancholy of the Sixth's opening fugue in E minor, over which the sun suddenly breaks as the music slips into G major: perfect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
