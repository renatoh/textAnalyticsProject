Injury prevented him from showing what many believe he is capable of in last season's Gold Cup, but on Sunday we could be hailing a new champion. Kempton has been a happy hunting ground for Kingscliff's trainer, Robert Alner. One of the best in the business when it comes to preparing a chaser for the big day, Alner has saddled 24 winners at the Sunbury track in the past 10 years, and 20 of those have come in chases. His record in non-handicap chases here makes even better reading, with a strike-rate of nearly one in three. Recent results show the Dorset stable to be in cracking form, so Kingscliff's lack of a prep run need not hinder him. Unbeaten in point-to-points and hunter-chases, including the 2003 Christies Foxhunter at the Cheltenham Festival, Kingscliff won at the first time of asking in handicap company at Ascot last season. That performance, a 17-lengths success in a strongly-run race, marked him down as something special - Andrew Thornton rode most of the way without steering after Kingscliff's reins broke. Kingscliff followed up at Cheltenham and looked set to rise all the way through the handicap ranks, but he flopped at Haydock in January and returned with a serious muscle injury. A crack at the Gold Cup was ruled out. Alner reports there has been no recurrence of that problem with Kingscliff, who stays well but is not short of speed. The King George is usually won by racing close to the pace, and backers of favourite Kicking King can take heart from his style of running. It just remains a question of whether Tom Taaffe's charge is a proper three-mile horse. Kicking King is certainly a class act at 2m4f, as he showed when slamming Rathgar Beau in the John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown. On his only attempt at three miles, Kicking King was out-stayed by Beef Or Salmon at Down Royal. Taaffe is convinced his stable star will not fail through lack of stamina, but the vast majority of King George winners have been proven stayers. There is always the exception, of course, and last year Edredon Bleu achieved the unthinkable when rallying to hold off the challenges of Tiutchev and First Gold. But there have been a host of top two-milers who have failed at Kempton and even the undoubted class of Azertyuiop may not be enough to see him home. Only Moscow Flyer is rated higher than him in current BHB assessments, but Azertyuiop will be something special indeed if he can run to his mark over a distance way beyond his norm. Ruby Walsh has angered Le Roi Miguel's owner by switching to Azertyuiop, but there is also a stamina doubt about the former. Tiutchev was ridden with a view to conserving his suspect stamina in last season's race, and may have been unlucky. A resounding victory over 3m1f at Aintree in the spring dispelled any such doubts, and he comes into the reckoning despite the lack of a run this time. Martin Pipe has yet to win the King George, but horses placed in the race often run well here again, and Tiutchev may be a stronger candidate for the champion trainer than Therealbandit, who has done most of his racing on left-hand tracks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
