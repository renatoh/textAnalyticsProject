Research conducted by Refugee Action found that the Home Office was missing its own deadlines for finding emergency accommodation for homeless and destitute asylum seekers, and in some cases wrongly refusing those who make claims for emergency assistance. In one case, it took more than 10 months to make a decision on whether to grant an applicant asylum support \u2013 so long that the person had already received refugee status. Asylum seekers interviewed for the report say these errors have had dire consequences, including forcing families to stay in accommodation deemed not fit for habitation, with leaking toilets or no heating. One mother and her child reported sleeping on the floor because it was the only place they could avoid being bitten by bed bugs; a pregnant woman was forced to choose between sleeping on a stranger\u2019s sofa and sleeping in the street; at least one person has attempted suicide. Refugee Action analysed 315 cases logged between January 2016 and March 2017 in which they or another refugee charity, Asylum Support Housing Advice (ASHA) in Manchester, helped asylum seekers to apply for support. Asylum seekers are not allowed to work or receive mainstream benefits while they wait for a decision on their claim, but support is available to those who are destitute. Section 98 support helps provide emergency accommodation and board, while section 95 support is longer-term and entitles people to accommodation and an allowance of \u00a336.95 per week. The analysis found that applications for section 98 support were regularly wrongly rejected. Of the 88 people Refugee Action helped with applications, less than half were initially approved. Of those Refugee Action assisted to reapply, 92% were subsequently granted. In a large majority of these overturned cases, the successful second application offered no new evidence, indicating the Home Office was wrong to initially refuse the claim. \u201cIt is an appalling scandal and it has to stop,\u201d said Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action. \u201cThe government does have, on paper, policies and procedures to ensure that people who have fled war, abuse and persecution don\u2019t end up homeless. But in practice they are consistently in flagrant breach of those policies.\u201d \u201cThe scale of the Home Office failure to follow those policies and procedures is pretty staggering. In more than nine out of 10 cases for them to change their mind and issue an approval for a request for accommodation and support when they refused it the first time is extraordinary. There\u2019s clearly a huge gulf between what the system should be doing for people and what it\u2019s actually doing in practice.\u201d The report also alleges the Home Office is failing to meet its targets for providing emergency support, putting vulnerable people at risk of homelessness. According to Home Office guidance, a decision on section 98 emergency support should be given on the day the application is made, as long as the application is submitted by 3pm, due to the fact the application is for emergency assistance. In seven of the 88 cases Refugee Action assisted with in Manchester, no response was received by the Home Office that day, despite the application being made in time. In several instances Refugee Action paid for the applicant to stay at a hostel that night to prevent them from sleeping rough. The report also found issues with the granting of section 95 support. People supported by Refugee Action or ASHA waited an average of 59 days to receive the support after submitting an application. One man from Eritrea waited 308 days to hear about his claim and was granted refugee status before he received an answer. During this time he and his wife struggled to feed their child and baby and could not afford to heat their home during winter. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and anyone who has an emergency need for accommodation can ask to be put in initial accommodation whilst their applications for support are processed. \u201cAsylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute are provided with free, fully furnished accommodation. We also cover utility costs and provide a cash allowance to cover other essential living needs.\u201d This article was amended on 10 July 2017. A previous version said asylum seekers on section 95 support receive \u00a336.95 per day, they receive \u00a336.95 per week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
