But the argument that took off in Washington last week about Jack Lew's signature suggests this could be a premature prejudice. Mr Lew, whom Barack Obama nominated as his new treasury secretary last week, has a signature, if that's the word, with no known connection to the alphabet and more loops than a Slinky unwinding down a staircase. Some may say this does not matter but since the treasury secretary's signature appears on newly printed US banknotes, it is at least a legitimate talking point. Earlier eras took a different style of trouble over their signatures too. Look at the flourishes of Charles Dickens or Richard Wagner. Mr Lew has a less literal approach but even his distinctive loops are a reminder that a signature tells you more about a person than merely their name (or perhaps not, in this particular case),"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
