Across the country, lovers of camping are pitching their tents in gardens or living rooms, complete with marshmallows for toasting and guitars to play around mock campfires. Emma Cuff of West Malling in Kent is among the small but growing group of indoor campers dusting off their tents. \u201cWe\u2019ve got four camping trips booked this summer which may or may not go ahead, so for some fun we dug out an old tent from the loft.\u201d She posted the results on Instagram with the hashtag #thevirtualcampsite \u2013 and won a tent from Cool Camping, one of several companies encouraging people to post their home creations on social media. This week Cool Camping is giving away a pair of hiking boots to the best effort. Outdoor gear retailer Cotswold Outdoor and review site TentLife are both hosting virtual camp outs this Easter (the former\u2019s virtual Easter camp is on Saturday 11 April, #campingathome; the latter is promoting #stayhomecamp all weekend). Go Outdoors plans to offer tips in its GO Indoors project. The upside? Rain can\u2019t ruin an indoor camping trip. In other indoor antics, adventure travel company Much Better Adventures has put together a spoof self-guided itinerary on its site, which includes the \u201cCamino de Kitchen-Living Room pilgrimage\u201d and \u201cwild camping in your Living Room National Park.\u201d So far one person has attempted to book the trip. Meanwhile, outdoor swimmers have been trying to get that cold-water high in their gardens and bathrooms. Deya Ward posted photos of her wheelie bin dip on Instagram (\u201cthe quarry is small, so I recommend maybe dipping solo \u2013 but I highly recommend if you are also after the cold swim feeling\u201d). Others are attempting the #virtualicemile, like Becca Harvey from Bristol who wrote of her wheelbarrow swim: \u201cLaughter and community are the remedy to most problems and by god, as swimmers we\u2019ve got that in spades.\u201d If you would like to tell us about the inventive ways you are getting your outdoor fix at home, share them on Instagram with the hashtag #guardiantravelsnaps. Good luck \u2013 and remember: no real fires indoors!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
