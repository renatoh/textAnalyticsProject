I remember to the second when I heard the news that One Man was dead, killed at a sordid, muddy Aintree. I will never forget my agonised rage, unable to bear the thought of how willing, even eager, the horse would have been to make his last glorious leap. Two weeks earlier, I had been to the Cheltenham Festival for the only time in my life and watched the great grey win the Queen Mother Champion Chase. I had never known anything like it. It was, without doubt, the most involving race I have ever watched. The excitement of Derbies and Arcs seemed a genteel business by comparison. Every fence was a moment in which my heart leapt a chasm. The galloping space between these moments was merely a lull before the terrible surge came again. By the end I was hardly able to walk, so relentless had been the race's grip on my emotions. Afterwards, I stood beside the winners' enclosure and watched as the Queen Mother approached One Man with a hand outstretched. He ambled towards her, head gently nodding, the white-headed guest of honour at a garden party. And at this calm and courteous sight, this respite after intense combat, I wept. One Man was Cheltenham's darling, he seemed to know it, and generously he shared his greatness with the worshipping populace. As I reflected on the news from Aintree I remembered the way Cheltenham had looked to me, as I watched him bound across it like a white emblem of life: unforgiving, terrifying, a vast green Colosseum in which necks and legs can snap like icicles. I remembered, too, that after watching his victory I had thought: I never want to see anything like that again. I have done so, of course, have given in to myself and sneaked a look at the Gold Cup or the Grand National. But never without a sense of fear and shame and loathing; and rarely without seeing a horse die. Every year we watch the great National Hunt festivals in a spirit of excitement and celebration and blind belief that nothing will go wrong; pretty much every year something does go wrong, because it is in the nature of the sport. Then comes the guilt, and then the absorption of the guilt; and then off we all go again, revved up for another three or four days of fun and booze, high on a vitality that is all the more intense because it dances so closely with death. But worse than this is the sentimentality of National Hunt racing, which walks hand in hand with the sport's terrifying robustness. Oh - the lovers of \"the game\" will say - how hard it is for a trainer to come back from a race meeting and know that one of the stables will be empty! Oh, it is like losing a member of the family! Oh, how we all cry when we think about One Man/Lanzarote/Dawn Run/Gloria Victis, the way they soared into the air like happy stags and crashed back down again in horrible stricken heaps! Racing journalists almost inevitably focus on the sorrow that is felt by trainers and owners after they have sustained the loss of their beloved charges. Well, yes: I keep my tears for the horses, who have not been asked whether they want to race and jump, nor whether they are ready to die 10 or 20 years before their natural time. When the green screens went up around Dorans Pride at Cheltenham last month, for instance, it was somewhat hard to take the sickly ooze of grief that was spread over his corpse by people who were entirely willing to let him risk his neck, and to enjoy the spectacle of him doing so. And what of the anonymous horses? Bacchanal was a star when he lived, leaping around joyously in his pretty pink colours; his death is noted and mourned, not that it makes any difference to him. But every year there are the unknown horses, the unwanted names in the office sweep for the Grand National, who are truly, literally expendable in the name of entertainment. I always wondered how National Hunt racing would have coped had Red Rum or Desert Orchid broken their necks in front of a vast and loving public: might their deaths have dealt blows to the sport that would, eventually, have proved fatal? Or would we have absorbed our sadness and guilt, unwilling to let it interfere overmuch in our pleasure: not least the pleasure of raising a supremely hypocritical glass to our dear equine departed?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
