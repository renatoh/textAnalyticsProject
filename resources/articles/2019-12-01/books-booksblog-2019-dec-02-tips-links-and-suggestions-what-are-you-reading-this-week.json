Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Madeline Miller\u2019s The Song of Achilles has wowed paulburns: WOW! What took me so long to get to it? This retelling of the tale of Achilles through Patroclus\u2019 eyes is superb. Miller makes the gay relationship between them explicit, but delicately, sadly and with a great deal of good taste. But that is in some respects only a small part of the book, though it is at the spine of it. She recreates the world of Homer as you may never have imagined it before. Thetis, Achilles\u2019 mother, is terrifying. You really get a sense of how mortals and semi-mortals walked in fear of the gods in those olden days. Similarly, all the heroes of the Iliad leap off the pages, most notably the proud angry Agamemnon and Ulysses, ever cunning and wily \u2026 This book is a real treat. Don\u2019t miss it. Will Eaves\u2019 Murmur has had a similar effect on Paul Expat : Wow, heck of a book that one. It really left me impressed. A book full of risks and haziness and uncertainty and mathematical precision \u2026 It was beautifully enraging, awe-inspiringly frustrating. Eaves conjures the imbalance and hypothetical mindspace of Alan Turing in such a way as to be utterly true without ever being directly observable. From the scientific standpoint, Eaves commands the underlying principles in a way that few fiction (or non-fiction) authors have ever been able to accomplish all while being completely, beautifully hypothetical. You don\u2019t always have to say anything new to say a lot, as Empsk proves with this reaction to Leo Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina: Finished Anna Karenina a little while ago and have since been a bit adrift. I can\u2019t bring any great insight to it, and I feel a little foolish trying to - surely everything that can be said about it has been? I\u2019m glad that I have read it, and the more I think about it, the more I enjoy it. Olive Again by Elizabeth Stout has impressed amsams: Unputdownable book, something interesting on every page. Certainly up to the excellent standard of previous Olive Kitteridge novels. Maggie Ross\u2019s Writing the Icon of the Heart has proved \u201cdifficult, challenging\u2026 intimidating\u201d for kmir: Brutally honest and bracing since she says things we\u2019d probably rather not hear; we want mirrors fictions, comfort, noise, distraction- and not silence. Maggie Ross is a hermit/solitary who writes out of her silence\u2026 Much illumination here; little warmth. The chapter on \u2018discretion\u2019 is particularly good, discernment and the related word, discretion, being words/practices we\u2019re less likely to think about in late capitalism. To say and do what you need to and that you can do in no other way. Lots of interesting thoughts on the environment as well. jimitron5000 was not a fan of Anna Burns\u2019s Booker winner, Milkman: I\u2019m battling my way through Milkman by Anna Burns. I know this has had some mixed reviews here and I can understand why. I\u2019m not sure if the author intended this but it feels like it has been written so it is very inaccessible. At times the writing has terrific depth and turn of phrase but to find these parts you have to wade through treacle. I don\u2019t mind reading books like this occasionally but I feel like I should get some reward at the end. Unfortunately I think the only reward I will get is relief that it is over! And finally, tats1 had a different experience with Max Porter\u2019s Lanny: I loved it and made this hard cynic cry like a crying thing. I may have to give it a week and have a reread. For such a short book it has pretty much everything I want. I haven\u2019t read Grief Is The Thing With Feathers but if its anywhere as near as good I need to go read it soon. Sometimes it\u2019s good to cry like a crying thing! Interesting links about books and reading Thanksgiving with Laura Ingalls Wilder. A new coalition is taking on Amazon. Lithub on the 78 best book covers of 2019. (Hat tip to LLCoolJ_). Arundhati Roy on the rise of Modi and the far right in India. \u201cHe was telling jokes about Bertrand Russell at a time when the undergraduate audience scarcely knew who Bertrand Russell was.\u201d Clive James on Jonathan Miller.
