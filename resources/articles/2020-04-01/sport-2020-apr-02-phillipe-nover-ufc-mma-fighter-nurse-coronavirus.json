It was another nurse around his age, a man Nover knew was as fit and healthy as himself, having spent many shifts working side by side with him. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe, man,\u201d he told Nover, as other gurneys buzzed past them and paper-gowned medical personnel hustled back and forth through a chaotic emergency room. Nover put on a brave face and wished his colleague well, trying to bury the thoughts that the virus currently sweeping through New York City could take him out as well. At the hospital, Nover\u2019s has witnessed a lot of change since it was announced in mid-March that Covid-19 had come to the United States. For two weeks, Nover and his co-workers have been preparing for what they\u2019re calling \u201cthe apex\u201d, which is when the number of infections and deaths will reach their height. \u201cThey\u2019re saying in one to two weeks, we could have a healthcare system crash,\u201d says the 36-year-old Nover. \u201cThe tipping point is when we\u2019ll have to start deciding who gets the remaining ventilators. We\u2019re preparing for another Italy or Spain.\u201d Two weeks ago, the staff slowly shut down non-essential services to save masks and gowns for the ER. Nover, who regularly works in cardiology, volunteered for the ER or ICU \u2013 he\u2019d worked in an ER from 2005 to 2008. The hospital initially designated half its ER an isolation area for Covid-19 patients, but the virus quickly disregarded those arrangements. The afflicted are everywhere now, spilling out into hallways lined with gurneys like neatly parallel-parked cars. Even critical care patients have been wheeled into the hallways, connected to bulky transport monitors. The ICU is now dedicated exclusively to Covid-19. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve had an influx of patients, but it always settles down for a bit where we can catch our breaths,\u201d said Nover. \u201cIt\u2019s not settling down here.\u201d Exposure is a major topic of conversation among the medical staff. Covid-19 is highly contagious and like other hospitals around the country, personal protective equipment, like facemasks and gowns, is at a minimum and will likely run out at some point. Nover says the equipment is rationed and every nurse is told to write their names on everything in marker. \u201cI have all my protective equipment,\u201d said Nover. \u201cI don\u2019t mess around with protective gear. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a sauna suit, cutting weight for a big fight.\u201d Only two years ago, Nover was in the cage inflicting damage on his opponents, not tending to it. In 2008, Nover was a finalist during Season 8 of The Ultimate Fighter, the UFC\u2019s hit reality show that launched many a fighter\u2019s career. He didn\u2019t win the six-figure contract, but his performances secured him a spot in the UFC\u2019s featherweight division. During his 14-year mixed martial arts career, Nover had 23 professional fights \u2013 10 of them in the UFC. During his fighting career, Nover left nursing for a time, but later returned, balancing both careers the same way he had when he started fighting in 2003. \u201cI was a pretty physical kid and enrolled in every sport I could. Soccer. Baseball. Lots of team sports,\u201d says Nover. \u201cBoth of my parents wanted me to try martial arts and over time I began to like the one-on-one aspect of it over team sports.\u201d At the age of nine, Nover was introduced to traditional martial arts like jeet kune do and kung fu. But when a friend told him about Brazilian jiu-jitsu in their teens, Nover was hooked after his first session. In just a couple of years, he earned his black belt under Alexandre \u201cSoca\u201d Freitas and he was recently awarded a rare third-degree stripe from the legendary Renzo Gracie. Nover\u2019s father was a nurse for 30 years, a Patch Adams-type character who\u2019d gladly play the fool to get a laugh out of his patients. As a kid, Nover and his brother, also now a nurse, would dress up in scrubs from head to toe and practice playing doctor with one another. \u201cPutting on scrubs today like we did is not allowed, but when I wore it, I felt like a superhero,\u201d he says. After Nover graduated high school in 2002, his father said he would make a great nurse. \u201cMe being only 18, I told my dad that nursing was kind of a woman\u2019s thing, but he had a great reply,\u201d says Nover. \u201c\u2018There are a lot of women in the field,\u2019 my father said, \u2018and you get to work with a lot of them.\u2019\u201d Nover was surprised how much he liked nursing school. \u201cI learned about the human body, which I was passionate about,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a martial artist. I wanted to not only learn about sick people, but healthy people and how to be in optimum health.\u201d As a former professional athlete, Nover knows his health is better than most. That\u2019s why he volunteered to join the ER and ICU, where he believes he will contract the virus, if he hasn\u2019t already. \u201cI\u2019m very healthy. I eat right. I exercise. So why not go to the front line? There\u2019s a lot of nurses I work with who are older with family and kids. Some of them have overcome cancer or are managing diseases. A lot of the younger staff like me feel the same way. This is our calling. I never thought it would come to this, but this is what we signed up for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
