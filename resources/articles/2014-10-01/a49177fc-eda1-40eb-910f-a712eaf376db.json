The organisers claimed the protest drew about 3,000 people \u2013 far fewer than they had predicted \u2013 from across the country as part of a \u201cWeekend of Resistance\u201d against police forces in many parts of the country that are seen to target people of colour in general and young African Americans in particular. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for our lives,\u201d a St Louis rapper, Tef Poe, told the crowd. The demonstration was in part prompted by frustration at the slow pace of the grand jury investigation into the actions of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, 18, six times even though the victim was not armed and witnesses said he had his hands raised. There was little confidence among the protesters that Wilson will be indicted. The protest was also fuelled by other killings and the use of what critics say is excessive force in several incidents since Brown\u2019s death, including the shooting of another 18-year-old African American in St Louis on Wednesday. Police said Vonderrick Myers Jr fired a gun at an off-duty officer who tried to stop him for what the force called a \u201cpedestrian check\u201d. The killing has prompted its own nightly demonstrations amid accusations that the officer used excessive force in firing 13 bullets, hitting Myers six times. There are also questions about whether he had a legitimate reason to stop and question the victim. Marchers in Saturday\u2019s mass protest through St Louis carried signs reading \u201cStop racist police terror\u201d and \u201cWe want justice. We want change,\u201d and chanted \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot.\u201d One group carried a giant papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 effigy of Michael Brown with his hands raised. Some protesters taunted police officers on the route with demands to put \u201ckiller cops on trial\u201d but the great bulk of marchers and the police appeared determined to avoid the kind of violence that rocked Ferguson in the wake of Brown\u2019s death. The St Louis police chief, Sam Dotson, chatted to protesters, telling them he supported their right to demonstrate. He drew attention to the fact that his officers were wearing their normal uniforms, not riot gear. On Friday, Brown\u2019s family called on protesters not to use violence. Steve Shagwell drove for nine hours from St Paul to attend the protest. \u201cThere\u2019s a personal thing in it,\u201d he said, gesturing at the brace around his neck. \u201cI want to look the police in the eye and say I used to support you but no more.\u201d Shagwell, 31, said he was suing the St Paul police for injuring him but would not talk about it further because he said the case is the subject of a gag order. He said he would like to see Wilson put on trial for murder, but thought that would not resolve the real problem. \u201cWith enough pressure the law enforcement establishment might offer him up as a sacrificial lamb, although I doubt they\u2019ll even do that. But this march is about more than that. America\u2019s looking at this. That is how we change things. Let them know America is watching.\u201d The Reverend Dr Jack Sullivan Jr travelled from Greensboro, North Carolina. \u201cI have been stopped myself by law enforcement as an adult due to racial profiling,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a doubt there are officers with full integrity. But because racism is sown into the fabric of our society there are officers who are responsible for brutality and death of African American men.\u201d Sullivan said that although he was holding a \u201cJustice 4 Mike Brown, Indict now\u201d sign, the march had a wider purpose. \u201cIt will put officials on notice that we expect them to be held accountable for their actions. Along with that we need for America as a whole to stop acting innocent when it comes to racism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number of white people on this march is impressive to me. In my history, white people have not been involved in racial justice marches. But we really need the white community in America to come to terms with its racist past and the privilege it has afforded them. First they have to acknowledge that racism is a modern day evil.\u201d An array of interest groups travelled from as far as Los Angeles, Baltimore, Detroit and Philadelphia. Union leaders marched alongside revolutionary socialist organisations, Latino rights groups and activists demanding an end to the occupation of Palestine. Aasha Harbec travelled from Kansas City with a group of fast food workers demanding a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union recognition. She works at Taco Bell, earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. The 20-year-old, wearing a T-shirt with the slogan \u201cFast food workers for dignity and justice\u201d, said racial profiling by the police and working conditions were both issues of social justice. But she was also angered that Wilson has not been charged over Brown\u2019s killing. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Trayvon Martin thing. Nothing\u2019s getting done,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a person of colour, I know I\u2019m already guilty in the eyes of the police because I\u2019m black.\u201d The march is one of a number of events scheduled over four days. Late on Friday, protesters gathered outside the Ferguson police station to demand Wilson be put on trial. The Ferguson police were removed from frontline duty and the station was guarded by state troopers and St Louis county officers who initially held back. But officers in riot gear were called in after the demonstrators moved on to the police station grounds. A noisy standoff ensued, with protesters chanting into the faces of the police, but there was no physical contact and the demonstrators eventually left."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
