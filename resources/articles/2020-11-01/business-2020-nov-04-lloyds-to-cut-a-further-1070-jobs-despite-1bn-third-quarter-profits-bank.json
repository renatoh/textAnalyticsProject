The bank, which announced the cuts to staff on Wednesday morning, said the job losses were part of restructuring plans meant to simplify the business. Lloyds is also creating about 340 roles, although there is no guarantee that they will be filled by staff affected by the cuts. The cuts add to the 865 Lloyds announced in September, having put the reduction in headcount on hold during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The bank, which has not taken any help from the government\u2019s furlough scheme, said most staff affected by the latest round of cuts would not leave until January at the earliest. It added that staff would also be redeployed where possible. The cuts will mostly affect the group transformation division \u2013 including staff working on IT and digital changes across the bank \u2013 as well as the retail business. Staff in its insurance and wealth offices will also be affected. No frontline staff or branches will be hit by the latest round of job losses. Accord, a union with members in the Lloyds Banking Group (LBG), said: \u201cThe job losses are a real blow as people continue to deal with the impacts of the pandemic and lockdowns \u2013 making the search for alternative roles very difficult for those facing redundancy at a time of increasing unemployment.\u201d Unite, another union that has members who work for LBG, said the cuts were hard to square with the quarterly results announced last week. It is urging Lloyds to put its restructuring plans on hold in light of the pandemic. Unite said: \u201cLBG has produced better-than-expected third-quarter results, posting in excess of \u00a31bn of pre-tax profit \u2013 a direct result of the hard work and versatility of its workforce. This cost-cutting strategy will not serve the bank or its customers. It is impossible to reconcile the job losses announced today with such an improved balance sheet.\u201d Lloyds said: \u201cThese changes reflect our ongoing plans to continue to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs and make parts of our business simpler. \u201cChange does mean making difficult decisions and our focus remains on supporting our customers, colleagues and communities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
