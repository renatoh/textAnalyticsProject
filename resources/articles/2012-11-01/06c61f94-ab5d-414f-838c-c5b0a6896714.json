During the transaction, the till roll ran out of paper and the tickets couldn't be printed, so I was told I would have to be charged again when the till roll was replenished as they are no longer able to cancel in-flight transactions. The stewardess promised that she would refund me when we landed, but four months on I'm still waiting. MvD, London The inability to cancel transactions sounds a most felicitous inconvenience for the airline. When a company says it has to charge you twice to circumvent technical obstacles \u2013 and this is not as rare as you might think \u2013 slam your wallet shut and shop elsewhere. I had to chase easyJet for three weeks before it issued a bald apology. It says its supplier has now refunded you directly.
