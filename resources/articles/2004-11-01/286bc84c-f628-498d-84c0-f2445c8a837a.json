And it was one of the world's most dangerous, whether or not you were driving. Launched in 1927, the competition was abandoned 30 years later after a Ferrari burst a tyre at 120 miles an hour and ploughed into the crowd, killing the driver, co-driver and 10 onlookers. Stirling Moss, who won the Mille Miglia in 1955, remembers that \"on the first 100 miles you'd see blazing wrecks either side of the road\". Moss's win was spectacular: he averaged almost 100 miles an hour over the course, 10 more than the previous record. His top speed was 180 miles an hour and at one point he noticed he was overtaking a plane. \"I can't see how the hell I did it,\" he says now. I can't imagine a more pointless, overrated sport than motor racing. But The Mille Miglia - A Stirling Effort (11am, Radio 4) still catches the imagination, as Moss travels back to Brescia, now the starting point for a vintage-car Mille Miglia, and is reunited with the three-litre Mercedes in which he roared to victory 49 years ago. That's it for today, but make time tomorrow for Hitler's Jazz Band (3.30pm, Saturday, Radio 4). The conductor Robert Ziegler reveals how Joseph Goebbels used \"degenerate negro music\" to spread Nazi propaganda among the allies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
