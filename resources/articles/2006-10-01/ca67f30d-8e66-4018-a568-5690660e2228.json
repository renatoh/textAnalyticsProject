Chelsea's manager had called for Hunt to be punished but the governing body decided it was impossible to prove violent intent. The referee, Mike Riley, confirmed that the incident had been seen by the match officials at the Madejski Stadium last Saturday. Fifa's guidelines allow retrospective action only after a clear and obvious error - the FA gave Manchester City's Ben Thatcher an eight-game ban this season for an elbow on Portsmouth's Pedro Mendes, for which he was booked, after concluding that the defender had behaved with malice. The FA's rule of thumb is to act where it feels a player would have merited more than a three-match suspension had he been sent off. Cech was yesterday moved to a hospital closer to his home and was said by Chelsea to be improving and walking unaided. Hunt has called the collision \"a terrible accident\" and his manager, Steve Coppell, hopes the midfielder will not be affected by the incident. \"It is a vital part of his game to be busy and buzzing around and I want him to carry on like that,\" he said. Mourinho has confirmed that Andriy Shevchenko will be on the bench for one of three league and Carling Cup games in a eight-day spell from tomorrow. The Ukrainian has scored one goal in 11 European and Premiership matches but the manager emphasised that his spell on the bench would be simply rotation. Frank Lampard said Chelsea had an added desire to beat Barcelona after the incidents at Reading. \"It's been a difficult time for the lads with the injury to Petr,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone in the team has been through an injury like Petr did. It was such a freak injury, but I think it gave an extra dimension to our game. There was a lot of spirit among the lads and we wanted to win the game not exactly for Petr but with Petr in mind. \"We've always had durability and spirit and any top team has to have that, especially when you play a team of Barcelona's ability. You have to be strong and together throughout the game and we showed that in what was a top performance. You could see at the end what it meant to the team.\" Chelsea have lost and drawn at Camp Nou in the past two seasons but there will be pressure on Barcelona to win when the teams meet there in a fortnight. \"We only have four points and if we want to proceed we have to get the points against Chelsea and Werder Bremen,\" said Giovanni van Bronckhorst. The left-back praised Chelsea's defence but said: \"Last year they were a bit more dangerous with three strikers up front and the speed they had.\" Drogba is arguably doing the job of three strikers at the moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
