Huhne told The Observer it would be 'ridiculous' to spend up to \u00a315bn updating the ageing submarine-based nuclear arsenal, describing it as a Cold War relic. He also argued this would risk further tying Britain to American policies, something he suggested should be avoided in the wake of the Iraq war. Huhne, the party's environment spokesman, spoke out as Clegg revealed that he would place Europe at the centre of his campaign in the coming days, and would make strong support for the EU a 'dividing line' with both Labour and the Tories if he won the contest to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell. Clegg, the party's home affairs spokesman, has emerged as the bookmakers' favourite after taking a lead in endorsements among the party's 63 MPs. He also won the early public support of Lord Ashdown, party leader for more than a decade until 1999. But the contest will be decided by a month-long ballot of the party's more than 55,000 members beginning in mid-November. With nominations closing on Wednesday, the two declared candidates are embarking on 10 hustings around the country before the ballot papers go out. Huhne's remarks on Trident will be seen as a bid to build support at the grassroots. Significantly, they followed an announcement on Friday by David Steel, the Liberal Party leader from 1976 until 1988, that he was backing Huhne, partly because he was likely to be 'bolder' than Clegg in getting rid of Trident. At this year's spring conference, the Liberal Democrats said a final decision on the sea-based nuclear arsenal should be deferred until 2014 by extending the lifespan of the current missiles. The possibility of supporting a new generation of Tridents with a reduced number of missiles and submarines was left open. Huhne ruled this out. He said he favoured a less powerful, 'minimal' deterrent, even if that meant it would be 'more vulnerable' to attack by other nuclear powers. The old Cold War presumption of a threatened Soviet first strike no longer made any sense, he argued. The current threats came from 'rogue states' or 'terrorists' and did not require a system like Trident to provide a deterrent. 'It would be ridiculous to replace the system with something of equivalent power, strength and lack of vulnerability. It will also make us dependent for decades to come on the US for maintenance,' he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
