It is by far Dalbesio\u2019s most high-profile gig to date. But Dalbesio\u2019s appearance in the campaign \u2013 under the tagline Perfectly Fit \u2013 sparked a frenzy on social media. The cause? Dalbesio is, technically speaking, a plus-size model. \u201cGenuine WTF moment,\u201d wrote one Twitter user. \u201cPlus-size??? I must be extra plus plus,\u201d wrote another. Some directed their ire at Calvin Klein, despite the American brand never alluding to the model\u2019s size, and simply placing her alongside the \u201cstraight size\u201d models \u2013 as they\u2019re described in the fashion industry \u2013 without comment. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of confusing because I\u2019m a bigger girl,\u201d Dalbesio told Elle about her work with Calvin Klein. \u201cI\u2019m not the biggest girl on the market but I\u2019m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like [Calvin Klein] released this campaign and were like, \u2018Whoa, look, there\u2019s this plus-size girl in our campaign,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey released me in this campaign with everyone else; there\u2019s no distinction. It\u2019s not a separate section for plus-size girls.\u201d At 5ft11in and a US size 10 (approximately a UK size 14), Dalbesio is indeed a plus-size model \u2013 agencies specialising in plus-size models begin at a UK size 12 for women. Dalbesio describes herself as \u201cin between\u201d, in terms of size. Plus-size as a concept has been co-opted \u2013 albeit sporadically \u2013 by the mainstream fashion industry in recent years. The fits and starts that the fashion industry has made towards diversity have included Vogue Paris ran a plus-size edition (edited by Penelope Cruz) in 2010, and models such as Crystal Renn, Kate Dillon and Robyn Lawley have all featured in either mainstream campaigns, cover shoots or catwalks. Plus-size clothing is itself a burgeoning market; sales of size 14-plus clothes exceeded $16bn in the US in 2013, according to Forbes. But the key difference with Dalbesio\u2019s appearance in the Calvin Klein adverts is that the only attention called to her size has come from the public. For years women and men have been asking why models who represent \u201cnormal\u201d sizing can\u2019t be used in high profile campaigns without it being a gimmick or a marketing ploy. In Dalbesio\u2019s latest work, their voices have been heard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
