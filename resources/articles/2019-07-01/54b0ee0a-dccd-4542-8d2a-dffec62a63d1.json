Abusers are protected by the isolation of the countryside and traditional patriarchal attitudes, says the report from the National Rural Crime Network. It is the first study of its kind and finds that close-knit rural communities can facilitate abuse which can last, on average, 25% longer than in urban areas. Some abusers move their partners from urban areas, where detection is more likely, to rural areas. The report, published on Wednesday, says: \u201cRurality and isolation are used as a weapon by abusers. Financial control, removal from friends, isolation from family are all well-understood tools of abuse.\u201d It continues: \u201cWe have revealed a traditional society where women (and it is mostly women) are subjugated, abused and controlled, not just by an individual abuser, but de facto by very the communities in which they live, too often left unsupported and unprotected. This is not at all unique to rural areas, but it is very significant, and change is slow.\u201d Abusers exploiting isolation is a common theme in the report. One woman said: \u201cMy partner used to deliberately drive off to work with the kids\u2019 car seats in his car, which meant I could not go anywhere safely because I was stuck in the cottage with the kids \u2026 it was just another way he isolated me and kept me from interacting with anyone else.\u201d The National Rural Crime Network is funded largely by police forces and their police and crime commissioners, to improve public safety in rural areas. The report says that traditional, patriarchal communities control and subjugate women. \u201cRural communities are still dominated by men and follow a set of age-old, protected and unwritten principles. \u201cMen tend to hold the rural positions of power \u2013 head of the household, landowner, landlord, policeman, farmer. This patriarchal society makes women more vulnerable to coercion and control, prevented from speaking out and accessing support.\u201d Some cases have led to murder, such as that of Lance Hart, 57, who shot dead his wife Claire, 50, and daughter Charlotte, 19, in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in 2016, before killing himself. Claire Hart suffered years of controlling behaviour without the authorities realising and was killed after leaving her abusive husband. One caseworker in County Durham said of the people suffering: \u201cMany of them are in such a stressful situation they have shut down from any kind of rational thinking. It\u2019s like all their effort goes into survival mode or protection for the kids \u2026 The longer it goes on the less likely they are to see the dangers.\u201d Escape is harder than in urban Britain because of shrinking resources and cuts to public services, the report says. \u201cThe availability of public services in rural areas more generally is on the decline, limiting the support networks and escape routes available to victims. \u201cA recently evidenced reduction in rural GP practices and challenges of effective broadband are good examples. This equally extends to services like buses and trains, whereby it remains very difficult (and getting worse) to travel within rural areas without a private vehicle. Abusers use this to limit victims\u2019 movements, rendering already inaccessible services all but impossible to contact.\u201d Tight-knit communities keep victims in abusive relationships with perpetrators masquerading as pillars of rural life. One victim said: \u201cIn reality, no one wants to get involved in another person\u2019s personal life. In my case, because he played for the village cricket team he had the support of everyone and this made me feel even more isolated. It was like no one would ever take my side over his.\u201d Women were expected to perform traditional roles under threat of abuse. One female victim said: \u201cI understood what happened when I failed to provide what was expected. It started with a row, angry words really and then a crushing silence. \u201cLater this escalated to more consistent violence but never when the children were around. He would twist my arm or pull my hair and kind of whisper that I wasn\u2019t treating him properly. Only once did he actually strike me hard \u2013 it was a punch to my stomach \u2026 all I had to do was perform in my role and I did.\u201d The study says the police response is improving, but worse than that in urban areas. One victim said: \u201c I never really considered calling the police \u2013 what\u2019s the point? By that time, I had been hit, slapped or punched anyway.\u201d Julia Mulligan, the chair of the National Rural Crime Network who is also the North Yorkshire police, fire and crime commissioner, said: \u201cThey are underestimating what is going on in rural communities and police need to listen.\u201d There are also horror stories involving the police; the report details one woman\u2019s experience: \u201cThe first officer had implied she was \u2018silly and neurotic\u2019 (he subsequently faced disciplinary action). It took nearly two years for her case to come to court and during that time she was befriended by another officer. \u201cHowever, the relationship turned toxic, he took advantage of the situation and also became controlling and monitored her movements. This officer was also a prominent member of the local community and shared mutual friends with her ex-husband.\u201d The woman said: \u201c I have lost everything I owned because I have had to leave and yet I am the victim.\u201d Mulligan said: \u201cThis report is clear \u2013 domestic abuse is hidden under our noses, hidden by abusers who like to keep it that way and on a scale of abuse hitherto unseen \u2026 its scale and nature is starkly exposed for the first time. Nodding and promising to carry on much as we do now is not good enough.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
