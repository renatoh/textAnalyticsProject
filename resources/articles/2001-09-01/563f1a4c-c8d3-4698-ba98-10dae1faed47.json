In marked contrast to the national flag carriers, both insisted they had no plans to axe staff, promised further cheap flights and criticised pleas from their rivals for state aid. In a robust but cautious trading statement last night Luton-based EasyJet said bookings, which fell 26% the day after the attacks, had more than recovered, partly thanks to a seat sale last weekend, and would continue despite tougher security at airports. The airline said that, in the week to Sunday, it sold 188,089 seats compared with an average of 146,467 a week in the half-year to September 10 and load factors this month should surpass 80%. Promising full-year profits in line with market expectations and pointing to significant cash reserves, EasyJet said low-cost airlines would be \"more resilient, particularly if they fly point-to-point within Europe.\" It added: \"The industry will experience some short-term pain but the contraction is likely to provide a range of unique slot and airport opportunities.\" It still plans to take delivery of 26 new Boeing 737s between now and May 2004. Ryanair's ebullient chief executive, Michael O'Leary, vowed to \"fly our way out of this crisis\" as he offered 1m seats on its planes at \u00a39.99 from October to January. Mr O'Leary, a fierce critic of national carriers such as British Airways for running to governments for state aid, said: \"Other companies are grounding flights, laying off staff. Our solution is to get back in the air with more passengers and lower fares.\" Ryanair's rivals such as BA are shedding tens of thousands of jobs to offset a steep cut in flights, and yesterday SAir Group said it would merge its Swissair and regional Crossair units in a move that will cost thousands of jobs. It is already shedding 3,000 posts in catering. The group, which is cutting long-haul flights by a quarter, is trying to stave off bankruptcy. Its chairman, Mario Corti, said it needed up to Sfr3bn (\u00a3435m) in fresh equity. But Mr O'Leary, announcing the cut-price offer which ends tonight, claimed that Ryanair's bookings last week were higher than before the attacks on New York and Washington. The offer covers one-way tickets, including tax, but excludes the peak period over Christmas and New Year. \"It's a clever marketing ploy,\" a rival low-cost airline executive said. \"But these were seats going begging; Mike's planes are only 70% full.\" As more airlines won war risk insurance, KLM imposed a safety surcharge on its flights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
