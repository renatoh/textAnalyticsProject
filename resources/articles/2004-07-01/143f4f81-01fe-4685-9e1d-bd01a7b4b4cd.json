They will see Lance Armstrong go off last of the 157 starters in the yellow jersey after taking his second stage win this year here yesterday, to end the young Frenchman Thomas Voeckler's dream spell in the lead. The young Italian Ivan Basso talked a good race on the rest day, but on the hilly roads breaking up the Vercors plateau yesterday he and his CSC team threw away a rare chance to put Armstrong under pressure, as Jan Ullrich finally discovered his racing legs and the aggressive spirit that enabled him to push the American to the limit last year. Like Eddy Merckx, like Bernard Hinault and like Miguel Indurain, Armstrong now has the power to mesmerise his opponents like rabbits in a car's headlights. Basso and CSC will not say it openly, but riders in the team are making it plain that their priority is to win a place on the podium in Paris and they would rather not race aggressively and risk losing out. Yesterday, they may well have helped Armstrong to take the yellow jersey, to the confusion and annoyance of Ullrich's T-Mobile team. Ullrich, who had put in extra training on the rest day, leapt away amid the beech and pine trees on the Col de l'Echarasson leading up to Vercors plateau. He devoured the mountain road like a man possessed, and rapidly gained a minute. The German had started the day almost seven minutes behind, but had his team-mate Andreas Kl\u00f6den marking Armstrong, together with Basso. \"I wasn't very concerned; we knew the course well and knew there was no real descent, so it was easy for two teams to work together,\" said Armstrong. \"It would have been different if I had been isolated, but I had team-mates there.\" He also had allies of circumstance in CSC, who were aware that Francisco Mancebo, one of Basso's rivals for a place in the top three, had been left behind and also did not want Ullrich to threaten Basso's second place overall. As Ullrich rode through the remnants of an earlier escape which included CSC's Jens Voigt, the team manager Bjarne Riis ordered Voigt to drop back and tow Armstrong and Basso's group. Ullrich was duly reined in, and at the finish in Villard-de-Lans Basso was not even capable of winning the four-rider sprint for the stage win. \"Of course it was strange - I'd say that if they wanted to win the race and Basso was good, then this was the day to go with Jan and chance everything,\" said a T-Mobile spokesman. Ullrich's mentor Rudy Pevenage was more succinct, terming the unofficial pact \"unsporting\". The Texan was clearly overjoyed at winning what the French would term a \"royal sprint\", that is one between the four strongest riders. Most of his stage wins are solo, either time-trials or lone mountain-top finishes, and he has not taken a sprint involving a group of more than two since his first Tour stage win 11 years ago. The other priority was the 8sec time bonus for finishing first to Basso's second. \"Johan [Bruyneel, Armstrong's manager] was screaming in my ear that I had to win. Every second counts.\" That phrase, the title of his second autobiography, applies here in spades. For others, the gaps were counted in minutes. \"Allez Thomas, France is proud of you\" and \"Thomas, right to the end\" read the signs on the roadsides, and yesterday the end finally came for the home fans' new chou-chou (darling), Voeckler, who was unable to stay with the leaders on the Echarasson as Ullrich's team-mates upped the pace. Voeckler has slipped to eighth overall and may lose more time today and tomorrow now that the maillot jaune can no longer weave its magic. But his spell in yellow, 10 days, equalled Pascal Lino's tenure in 1992, which makes it the longest by a Frenchman since Hinault in 1985. He retains the white jersey of best young rider, but may be pushed hard for it by another Frenchman, Sandy Casar, and the Russian Vladimir Karpets. French honour will also be upheld by Richard Virenque, who led over four of yesterday's seven climbs and now looks likely to win a seventh King of the Mountains prize, one more than the current joint record holder, Lucien van Impe. Today's stage is dedicated to another climber with a controversial past, the late Marco Pantani, who was first to the ski resort in 1995 and 1997, and holds the record for the ascent. That was set in an EPO-fuelled era, but may well fall today. As well as shaking up the overall standings, today's mountain time-trial - the toughest in the Tour since 1987's contre-la-montre up Mont Ventoux - will also challenge the backmarkers, who will have to fight to stay within the time limit, calculated at 33% of the winner's time. The Basque Ib\u00e1n Mayo, tipped three weeks ago by Armstrong to win today, will not even get to the Alpe. Having made it as far as the rest day in N\u00eemes, he clearly decided yesterday morning that more rest was what he needed and he did not start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
