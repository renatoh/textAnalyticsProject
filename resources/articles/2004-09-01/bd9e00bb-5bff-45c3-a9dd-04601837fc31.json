This was in the 1930s and it was the highest notion of chic. As a child I was fascinated by the creature. It had a strange similarity to picture book depictions of early man draped in the skins of the wild beasts he had killed. Though, of course, I knew my mother hadn't killed the fox. We didn't move in such fox-killing circles. People who hunted were the grand folk who owned things like horses and land and sent their children away to school. They were as remote from us as Amazonian natives, so there was no question of our envying them, or even giving them a second thought. In those days our world - everyone's world - was very cut off from that of other social groups living within the same country, even the same county. None the less my mother's wearing of the fur was a gesture of social aspiration. She had probably seen sepia photographs in society magazines of young people such as, say, the Mitfords, or the Manners families, perhaps, being gaily abandoned, happy and fun. Life for my mother was none of these things. But at least she had the fur. And I was sometimes allowed to play with it. The sleek fur of its body was lined with brown silk, and its paws hung loose and helpless. Its mouth could still bite but its grip was that of a Bakelite clip that snapped open and shut around one of the forelegs. I never thought how once it had been a living creature. It was part of my mother's feminine display. Times change. I had thought all that was over. I recall the 1970s protests against fur-wearing and a brilliantly shocking commercial made by David Bailey in which gorgeous models parading in furs, were suddenly spattered with blood as they swung the garments from their shoulders, at first a glimpse, then more blood cascading on the catwalk. It was horrifying. There was a rally in Trafalgar Square with the wry banner \"The first person to wear your coat died in it.\" We all listened and took notice. By then I had my own fur jacket - bought in China in the early 80s, when such things were sold very cheaply to tourists. It was blonde fox fur. But it had a short life. I wore it once filming for television and my producer refused to have me on camera. Why? \"Because if people see you wearing it, you'll get turds through your letterbox.\" Ever since, it has been assigned to the back of the cupboard and lurks there still. Quite right too. With the invention of fake fur that looked like the real thing, we came to think that the wearing of the real thing was dying out. I recall being startled at seeing a famous American actress attending the National Theatre in a full-length sable and thinking how old-fashioned she looked. Society progressed, hadn't it? People moved from barbaric practises to more civilised values and small incremental improvements in behaviour became the norm. With the invention of fake fur, this offered no hardship or sacrifice from anyone, so the high moral tone came at no cost. But what became the received wisdom on furs here, wasn't forced on anyone. Travelling in Europe it was clear that wealthy and elegant women in fashionable Paris and Madrid were still wearing their furs and taking pride in their elegance and style. Clearly the British campaign hadn't reached them. Besides, they said, the British have always been odd about animals. Now I read that fur is back in fashion, and not all of it is fake. What's more, some of the anti-fur brigade are also anti-fake-fur because it glamourises the very thing it fakes. Fashion is often transgressive, seeking deliberately to flout the norms of seemly and conventional dressing. So perhaps the wearing of fur is a typically cheeky thing to promote. So whatever happened to progress? Are values simply cyclical, with behaviour which one generation came to see as bad, coming back generations later among their children who are no longer shocked? I would have thought that with the high profile given to animal conservation, with the statistics of dying species so familiar, the world would have moved on for good in its treatment of animals. Yet I recently received a lavish sales brochure for a luxurious crocodile handbag. Fortunately it cost more than \u00a35,000. So I shan't be buying many of those. But I do need my chimneys sweeping and I was wondering whether a small boy might be available. joan.bakewell@virgin.net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
