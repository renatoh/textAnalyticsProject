And while there are gems on Real Girl there are few quirky enough to match Mutya's peerless vocal charisma. The one big surprise is a huge electro romp with Groove Armada, bizarrely kept back as Mutya's second single when the first - the Lenny Kravitz-sampling 'Real Girl', perfectly pleasant and in parts quite wonderful - still reveals slightly too much about this album's superfluous misfires, which delve too far into limp and forgettable R&amp;B."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
