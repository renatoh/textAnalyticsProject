It was in 2010 that Cotter guided Clermont to the Top 14 title after 10 successive defeats in the final. After the match, Guy Nov\u00e8s \u2013 friend, former hunting partner, and opposite number today \u2013 sent him a message that read: \u201cNice bullet, it went straight to the heart!\u201d As the message would suggest, Cotter is apparently the more accomplished hunter but a triumph against Les Bleus today would be big game indeed. They do not come more understated than \u201cStern Vern\u201d but while there was little jubilation in the Kiwi\u2019s voice after Scotland\u2019s thrilling 27-22 win against Ireland in the tournament curtain-raiser last weekend, there was certainly relief. To approach the second week with a win already under their belts is a rare position for Scotland. In fact, they have done so just once before since the Five Nations became Six and it is in stark contrast to last year when they were on a nine\u2011game losing sequence in the competition. No wonder Cotter has been speaking of the positivity with which Scotland will approach the challenge, all the while acknowledging that an element of surprise has gone out of the window after their exceptional first-half performance against Ireland. However, if it is one thing France knowing what Scotland will attempt to do, it is quite another stopping it. Even if Finn Russell was quiet against Ireland, the centres Alex Dunbar and Huw Jones were not, while Stuart Hogg was electric at full-back and defensively they were redoubtable, Hamish Watson and the Gray brothers leading the way. In Greig Laidlaw they also have perhaps the form kicker in the northern hemisphere and while comparisons with Jim Telfer\u2019s class of 1999 \u2013 the last Scotland side to win in Paris \u2013 are inevitable, this year they are merited. The challenge against France will not be hard to miss, however. Nov\u00e8s has made one change \u2013 Loann Goujon replaces Damien Chouly at flanker in a move that only adds to Les Bleus\u2019 power. Scotland\u2019s scrum wobbled against Ireland, particularly in the first half, and Sunday represents another forensic examination of the 21-year-old tighthead Zander Fagerson\u2019s credentials. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious where they are coming at and how they are going to play against us,\u201d said Cotter, who returns to France to take over at Montpellier next season. \u201cThey believe they can overpower us. You can see that in the team selection. They believe that this is the game that\u2019s going to set their Six Nations alight. \u201cWe have seen and heard the noises coming out of their camp. It\u2019s pretty clear: they are a big juggernaut, they are going to roll over the top of us, we are the type of team they like to play against. They are good going forward, we just need to see how good they are going backwards. We would like to be able to do that and, if we can, then we give ourselves a chance.\u201d For Scotland to play with the sort of abandon they would like, they will hope that the Stade de France pitch has lost its habit of cutting up in the opening stages of matches but there is no doubting it would suit the French more if it has not. Simply trying to put the squeeze on Scotland, though, is a dangerous tactic for France. They tired in the final 10 minutes in losing against England last weekend and with a sizeable chunk of Cotter\u2019s side playing their part in Glasgow\u2019s recent home and away victories against Racing 92, travelling to Paris is not the daunting a prospect it once was. France meanwhile, having lost their past three matches by narrow margins \u2013 against England, New Zealand and Australia \u2013 are in desperate need of a victory. There is increasing pressure on Nov\u00e8s and if France cannot bulldoze Scotland up front the onus will be on them to free their Fijian flyers out wide. Much will then rely on the scrum-half Baptiste Serin, of whom a big future is predicted, and Camille Lopez at fly-half \u2013 that Nov\u00e8s has not changed his half\u2011backs can at least be viewed as progress. \u201cIt\u2019s true that against Australia we could have won but didn\u2019t; against New Zealand we had a chance at the end and lost by little; against England we lost at the end: it\u2019s annoying,\u201d Nov\u00e8s said. The worry for Scotland is that France will vent those frustrations soon enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
