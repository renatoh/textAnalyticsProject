The announcement was the communist state's latest provocation amid deadlocked talks over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. A foreign ministry spokesman said the country had \"successfully finished\" removing 8,000 fuel rods from the reactor at its Yongbyon complex, which was shut down last month, so it can \"bolster its nuclear arsenal\". The South Korean foreign ministry expressed \"serious concern\" at the development. Washington said the north's \"provocative statements\" about its nuclear activities \"only further isolate it from the international community\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
