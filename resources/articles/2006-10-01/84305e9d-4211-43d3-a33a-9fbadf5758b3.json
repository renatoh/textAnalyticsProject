After mentioning Paul Robinson and David James, the Sheffield United manager named Shay Given. Republic of Ireland fans, more than familiar with Given's talents, hope the next week proves him right. With Given ruled out of the qualifiers in Cyprus tomorrow and at home to the Czech Republic on Wednesday because of injury, Kenny is poised to play his first competitive internationals. It continues a remarkable rise for the Halifax-born goalkeeper from eight years ago when he was turning out for Bradford Park Avenue in the Northern Premier League. These days Kenny is being kept busy in his first top-flight season with Sheffield United and is an established part of Ireland squads, being eligible through his Longford-born father. Caps have been limited to six in 2\u00bd years, though, with Given the undisputed first choice and a man whose agility has rescued Ireland countless times, rarely more strikingly than in Cyprus 12 months ago when he saved a penalty during an excellent individual display that resulted in an undeserved 1-0 win. Kenny intends to speak to Given before tomorrow and must hope the match proves to be more enjoyable than his most recent Ireland appearance, August's 4-0 home defeat by Holland. He was not to blame but pointedly refers to the episode as \"in the past\". He suffers nerves before all games but, having made a timely return from a thigh injury last Saturday, is calm about the challenges ahead. \"I have had some big games before,\" he said. \"I have played in an FA Cup semi-final and a play-off final, so it's just a normal game - that's how I will try to look at it.\" He acknowledged, though, that the qualifiers would \"probably beat\" everything so far. \"Sometimes you have to pinch yourself because when I think back it was only eight years ago I was doing engineering work and working all week.\" Warnock brought Kenny to Bury for \u00a310,000 in 1999 and took him to Bramall Lane for \u00a345,000 three years later. He may not look a stereotypical keeper, being stocky and at 6ft not especially tall, but he has shed excess pounds and played every minute for United in their promotion season. \"I took him to Bury and he looked like the Michelin Man,\" Warnock has said. \"We cut out the hamburgers, chips, meat pies and apple pies from his diet. Because of the shape he is, he won't always get the acclaim he deserves.\" When Kenny signed a contract extension last year, Warnock claimed that Petr Cech was the only Premiership goalkeeper he would exchange him for. He may not have been entirely serious but there was no doubting the sincerity of Ireland's goalkeeping coach Alan Kelly when he spoke of the confidence in Kenny. \"Playing in the Premiership will have helped his education,\" Kelly said. \"He's slightly unorthodox - he looks to get the game moving quickly and find an angle to get on the attack, and that's what we are about at the moment. He seems to be unfazed by most things, and that's another thing you need as a goalkeeper. His fitness has come on incredibly well in the last couple of years and his performances have gone with it.\" Kenny comes across as shy but Kelly insists there is no reticence on the pitch. \"I know many stories about him having rucks at Sheffield because I know a lot of the players there,\" he said. \"I think he is very vocal where he needs to be, and that's with his players.\" Calm efficiency, in the mould of Given, would do nicely for Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
