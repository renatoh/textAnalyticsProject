B&amp;Q, with 24% of the UK market, was hit by a profit warning in April after first-quarter like-for-like sales fell by 8%. Many analysts believe that it is not just the consumer confidence downturn that has hit the 340-store chain. They fear that it is stuck in a rut, failing to innovate and address changing trends. Full-year profit forecasts for Kingfisher have been cut from \u00a3694m less than 12 months ago to about \u00a3530m and could fall further this week. Mr Cheshire's task must show how he can reinvigorate the DIY sheds and regain some of the ground lost to Homebase, which has found new momentum since its acquisition by GUS. He has already confirmed 400 head-office job losses, and store closures could be on the cards. Analysts also want to see him promoting the stores' female appeal - on the grounds that women often make the key decisions on home improvement. Shares have fallen from more than 310p in January to 246p last week. According to Morgan Stanley, B&amp;Q is \"clearly having a dreadful year\". It adds: \"Over the next 12 to 18 months, the key driver of the Kingfisher share price will be the extent of any recovery at B&amp;Q.\" Other retailers reporting this week include the struggling French Connection, and Next, where analysts will be watching for the extent of profit-margin deterioration and any worsening of the rate at which Next's new bigger stores are stealing sales from its smaller outlets. However, a trading statement from Associated British Foods today is likely to show big demand for super-cheap chic at its Primark fashion chain, which recently acquired Littlewoods stores. Friends Provident unveils interims on Tuesday, with profits expected to be ahead 33% after the consolidation of Lombard International. On Wednesday, Provident Financial will give an update on improvement plans for its Yes Car Credit alongside group interims. Yes Car's poor performance led to a profits warning in July. Others reporting half-years this week include Centrica and the mining group, Antofagasta. On Friday, Centrica said its full-year profits would be hit by rising gas prices. There should be few surprises from Antofagasta. Housebuilders Bovis and Redrow and oil sector operators Wood Group, Premier Oil and Cairn Energy are also posting results."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
