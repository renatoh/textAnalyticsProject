Now they have been seen to care too much, many sportswriters, ever eager to clamber towards the moral high ground, have condemned them for disgracing the English game. There is an aching gap between those who cover football and those who follow it. In the pub where I was watching there was a sense of disappointment that Ballack did not end his sensational off\u2011the-ball run with the full Zidane. Had he done so he would have been hailed as a hero even as he walked from the pitch after the inevitable \u2013 although with referee Tom Henning Ovrebo nothing is certain \u2013 red card. Whatever else it would certainly have made for a sensational chalkboard. Equally, if Drogba had approached Ovrebo and started slapping him on each cheek while saying \"Who's the Daddy?\" the admiration of the pub would have been unbounded. As it was he limited himself to \"a fucking disgrace\", which everyone agreed was putting things rather mildly. Anyone brought up watching football in the 70s could not help but be struck by the absence of a pitch invasion. Then a touch-and-go offside decision might spark a charge; what would have been the effect of the failure to award four stone-cold penalties was never discovered because such a situation never arose. On a lucky day a ref might survive one such decision, in his dreams two, never three. Up in the Sky studios the man in the pub was ignored as Richard Keys kept blathering on about Sky Sports distancing itself from this and that as if anyone anywhere cared a jot about what Sky Sports thought (if indeed Sky Sports can think?) about anything. Jamie Redknapp struggled grimly with the concept of Norway. Only Graeme Souness was up for it, skilfully fanning the conspiracy flames. You could write the next day's Evening Standard headline before bed, the death threat to the referee being both de rigueur and, more importantly, untraceable. The fact that Ovrebo had to be smuggled out of the country was a galling touch. From Penzance to Cley next the Sea, the British used to smuggle in illegal booty, now they are reduced to smuggling out Norwegian referees. The decline of empire is complete. The only new wrinkle was the apparent establishment of a Facebook group (by our Facebook groups shall we be judged), although finding it was way beyond my capabilities. It was all rather dispiriting, but as nothing to the events of last Sunday when the Super Canaries let in a rapid-fire three first-half goals at Charlton. The man from Radio Norfolk was once again spot on: \"It's not as if we're playing Brazil \u2013 this team are bottom of the Championship, for goodness' sake, and still Norwich can't get a touch.\" All this lack of physical contact left me glum and in need of a laugh. Fortunately, one is to be had from, of all things, rugby union. Anyone who doubts this should go to chasethelions.com and admire the work of Hector O hEochagain and Risteard Cooper. In particular, Leinster man, being asked about O'Gara: \"Legend, legend, legend, legend ... they're all legends.\" And Malcolm the English fan: \"... and the crowd spontaneously started singing one of the great tunes of modern sport, really, erm, how does it go, 'Lions, Lions, Lions'.\" It's a fan's eye view and all the better for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
