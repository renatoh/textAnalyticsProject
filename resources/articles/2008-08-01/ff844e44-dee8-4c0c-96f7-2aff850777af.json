The 1965 Paris trio gig finds Rollins, often unaccompanied, turning a medley of I Can't Get Started, Three Little Words and St Thomas into a torrent of wriggling runs, barked exclamations and crunching low notes, and his quote-packed long soliloquy on an engagingly grumpy-sounding There Will Never Be Another You brings the house down. The Copenhagen gig has a much rougher sound, with an almost inaudible Kenny Drew on piano, but a much sparkier drummer in Albert Heath than the Paris show has in Art Taylor. Bassist Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen's solos never let the attention wander, and Rollins is untypically minimal and touching on Coltrane's Naima, while a 48-minute account of the Miles Davis standby Four shows how resourceful the saxophonist is with or without a rhythm section. The sound quality is pretty dire, but these are jaw-dropping examples of the way Rollins sounded on the bandstand in his golden era."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
