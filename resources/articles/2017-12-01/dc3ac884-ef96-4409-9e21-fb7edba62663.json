Raied al-Wazzan, the treasurer of the Islamic Centre in south Belfast, described those responsible as \u201cignorant people\u201d. He said: \u201cWe believe these people do not represent the vast majority of Northern Ireland. We have received many messages of support. They will not succeed. We have a very good relationship with all communities in Northern Ireland and we work hard with our outreach.\u201d His colleague Anwar Macady said that it was the first time the centre had been attacked in such a way, and it was sad that it had happened on Christmas Eve. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be celebrating mercy and forgiveness. I think this man is only representing himself, and a handful of people who may support him,\u201d Macady said. \u201cWe know that this person doesn\u2019t represent the wider society of Northern Ireland and we are very thankful for the people who sent us messages to tell us the message of support.\u201d Emma Little-Pengelly, the DUP MP for south Belfast, condemned those responsible. \u201cAttacking our small Muslim community in south Belfast is completely wrong, achieves nothing and is entirely misdirected,\u201d she said. In August an Islamic centre in Newtownards, Co Down, was subjected to a racist attack when a pig\u2019s head was left on its doorstep."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
