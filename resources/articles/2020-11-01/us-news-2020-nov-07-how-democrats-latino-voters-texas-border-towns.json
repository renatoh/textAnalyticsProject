But, after Donald Trump faced backlash for using the word \u201ccoyote\u201d to describe human smugglers, Oca\u00f1as was turned off by liberals focused more on semantics than the actual realities of the migrant crisis affecting her home. As the daughter of a Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9, she believes that undocumented immigrants are \u201cjust people, like you and me\u201d. However, when it comes to earning US citizenship, \u201cthere is a right way and a wrong way to do it\u201d, she said. She also fears what Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s administration could mean for people she knows who rely on jobs in refineries or hauling crude oil. So, faced with a ballot and a choice, Oca\u00f1as decided she preferred four more years with Donald Trump in the White House. \u201cNot all of us take it to heart when we\u2019re called rapists and bad hombres,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tough skin.\u201d In Texas border towns with chronically low voter participation, residents did actually show up to the polls this election, exceeding county turnouts from 2016. But when results rolled in Tuesday night, Biden\u2019s overall success was nowhere near Hillary Clinton\u2019s slam dunk four years earlier, revealing Democratic vulnerabilities among a key bloc whose votes had largely been taken for granted. \u201cDemocrats have just assumed and relied on this historical loyalty by people in the valley to the Democratic party,\u201d said Natasha Altema McNeely, an associate professor of political science at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. \u201cAnd that assumption, I think, is very dangerous for the Democrats if they expect to continue to help the valley remain blue.\u201d Biden still won Oca\u00f1as\u2019s Hidalgo county, but with a fraction of the margin. In Starr county, which Clinton had dominated in a 60-point landslide, voters swung for Biden by just five points. And, after Democrats squandered a nearly 33-point advantage from four years ago, Zapata county flipped to deliver Trump a stunning victory. That erosion of Democratic support took place even after high-profile Biden surrogates descended on the US-Mexico border ahead of election day. Jill Biden, Joe\u2019s wife, campaigned in El Paso on the first day of early voting, when \u2013 amid buzz that Texas might be in play \u2013 she told her audience that a win in the state would mean that \u201cwe are unstoppable\u201d. Then, in an 11th-hour push to get out the vote, former presidential rivals Beto O\u2019Rourke and Juli\u00e1n Castro joined forces with the vice-presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, in the valley last week. Harris had flown to south Texas, she said, \u201cbecause there are people here who matter\u201d. Although residents in the valley lean left in terms of partisanship, \u201cmany people actually bleed red\u201d ideologically, McNeely said. Some of that boils down to religious beliefs, with large contingents of Catholics and Protestant evangelicals in the area. There\u2019s also a pernicious machismo among some Latinos, so seeing a \u201cstrong man\u201d may have driven enthusiasm for Trump, said Manuel Grajeda, the Texas strategist for civil rights and advocacy organization UnidosUS. To Ed Espinoza, executive director of the media non-profit Progress Texas, south Texas\u2019s dramatic twist on election night looked \u201cless like Latinos leaving Biden and more like rural voters flocking to Trump\u201d. But a potential surge in conservative values doesn\u2019t fully explain why Democrats lost so much ground along the border. Going into the election, Texas Latinos were far less interested in social issues such as limiting abortion, and far more invested in policies around healthcare and the economy, according to the American election eve poll. Above all else, they were concerned about the raging coronavirus pandemic, and negative reactions to hardline local Covid-19 restrictions may have at least partly contributed to Democrats\u2019 lukewarm reception in the valley, McNeely suggested. Although county governments there initially garnered positive national attention for their swift responses to the deadly virus, a continued push for protective measures after the state abruptly emerged from lockdown proved controversial among some residents. Commenters online criticized officials for what they saw as heavy-handed, overblown reactions to the pandemic, McNeely said, even as valley hospitals racked up a devastating body count. Another potential factor is the sizable law enforcement presence in the valley and its surroundings, including officers with the federal government\u2019s highly politicized border security agency. Oca\u00f1as, for example, views border patrol agents as protectors, not enemies, and she balked at the criticism they have faced on the job. About three-quarters of valley residents oppose Trump\u2019s pet project of a border wall, including Oca\u00f1as, who is well aware that it will do \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to stop migrant crossings. But it does create jobs, she said, and as the Trump administration funds border enforcement, \u201cI see more action.\u201d The prospect of a tax hike also soured Oca\u00f1as on the Biden-Harris ticket, a recurring theme among voters, Grajeda said, despite Biden assuring Americans that anyone who made less than $400,000 a year would not experience a tax increase under his leadership. Where Oca\u00f1as lives, the median household income was below $40,000 in recent years. At the end of the day, Oca\u00f1as said, liberal Democrats just fundamentally misunderstand Latino voters \u2013 and talk down to them, \u201calmost like we\u2019re stupid, almost like we\u2019re children\u201d. Although she\u2019s tried to have conversations with people \u201con the other side\u201d of the political debate, she has been called straight-out crazy and a race traitor to her face. Victoria M DeFrancesco Soto, an assistant dean at the University of Texas\u2019s LBJ school of public affairs, hypothesized on election night that the lack of old-fashioned, grassroots organizing because of Covid-19 might have played a part in Biden\u2019s underperformance in the Valley. But the pandemic didn\u2019t stop caravans of Trump supporters from boisterously rallying around south Texas for months leading up to election day, a harbinger of what was to come. \u201cI think people who were excited to vote for Trump are just a lot more excited to do that than a lot of people who would turn out for Biden,\u201d Grajeda said. \u201cAnd I think the people who are most excited to turn out for Biden are middle-upper-class, white people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
