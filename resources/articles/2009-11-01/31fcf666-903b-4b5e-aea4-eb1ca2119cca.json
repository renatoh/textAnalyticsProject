But I think we will be fine for the Test matches.\" In Sunday's one-day international at Centurion, England beat South Africa heavily and the home bowlers took only three wickets. Procter said: \"Morne seems to have found his touch and that should make a difference for us. He's in good rhythm and with Dale Steyn that means we have two out-and-out strike bowlers. When we get Jacques Kallis back we will have another.\" Mickey Arthur, the South Africa coach, said: \"Morne will join us tomorrow. It's not a panic call-up.\" But Arthur conceded: \"We now know it's going to be a long summer for us.\" When he gets it right Morkel is a world-class fast bowler. But he struggles for consistency and was a disappointment when South Africa lost at home to Australia earlier this year. He has been brought in, partly, because Arthur wants to prepare him for the Test series, which will begin at Centurion on 16 December. But the home side also want to boost a one-day attack which flagged when England's batsmen put them under pressure three days ago. A week ago, Allan Donald said that Arthur was concerned South Africa would struggle to take 20 wickets in the four Test matches. \"I think the South Africa attack is bit weaker than England's,\" Donald said. \"The England attack is a nose in front with their tall bowlers.\". Arthur dismissed Donald's comments at the time. But now it seems that South Africa are genuinely worried about their bowling, even though they do have a world-class batting line-up, especially for the Tests. \"Graeme [Smith, the captain] and I have talked about the bowling,\" Arthur said. \"Our execution on flat wickets as bowlers is something we need to hone. I'm still in a fairly good place and confident that we have the right recipe somewhere down the line.\" On Sunday evening Arthur had harsh words for his players for their overall performance, not just their bowling. Donald's warning was backed up by the former South Africa captain Kepler Wessels, who said: \"South Africa will be relying heavily on Morne in the Test series. He's quick and aggressive and moves the ball away from the left-hander predominantly. He can get good players out. What they will do is have a go with Makhaya Ntini to start with to see how he goes with Morkel and Steyn and hope they will do the business.\" Ntini, 32, is in line to win his 100th Test cap at Centurion, even though some say his career is on the slide. What is worrying for South Africa, who are ranked first in the world in Tests and second in ODIs, is the shallowness of their reserve fast bowling. And spin is unlikely to defeat England here because the last South Africa spinner to take five wickets in an innings against them was Harry Bromfield in this city in 1965. Arthur has spent the opening weeks of the tour attempting to wind up the England players but today he conceded that they had played \"unbelievably well\" so far. Meanwhile, England's leading fast bowler Jimmy Anderson is aware that South Africa may attempt to undermine him with mind games this winter. \"I like the fact that they're saying they feel the need to get under my skin to affect me,\" he said. \"They can try if they want. Being the leader of the attack, they may want to target me a bit more. Maybe they think if they can get to me they can get to the rest of the bowlers. But I don't really get affected by stuff like that. I think it's something I can deal with.\" For the moment at least, though, it seems that South Africa are too preoccupied with their own shortcomings to get involved with more psychological sparring with England. It was confirmed today that the referral system would be used during the Test series. There has been a delay while the various bodies have wrangled over who would pay for the technology. \"I'm not 100% sure of the detail but this is the right way to go and it should be standard all over the world,\" Arthur said.Ends"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
