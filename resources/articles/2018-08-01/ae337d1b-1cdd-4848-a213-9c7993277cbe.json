Exhibition celebrates Shakespeare's Shoreditch origins", "bodyText": "A permanent exhibition is to be created in Shoreditch on the site of the London theatre where William Shakespeare perfected his trade as a playwright and actor. The Theatre, which opened in 1576 in what was then the rowdy outskirts of London, staged plays including Romeo and Juliet and was one of the first purpose-built theatres in England. A display revealing the foundations of the Theatre will open at the site on New Inn Broadway next year. Discoveries made at the site include a unique mug with the image of smart bearded gentleman \u2013 clearly one of the wealthy customers for the expensive gallery seats rather than the unruly groundlings \u2013 and pottery money boxes which kept the box office receipts safe because they had to be broken to be accessed. There will also be items on loan from museums illustrating the history of London\u2019s earliest theatre district. The Theatre, which opened when Shakespeare was still a schoolboy in Stratford-upon-Avon, was built for \u00a3700 by James Burbage with money from his brother-in-law \u2013 the partnership, like most of those involving the Burbage family, ended in acrimony. It was described by the Tudor antiquarian John Stow as a house for \u201ccomedies, tragedies and histories for recreation\u201d. It was built outside the city walls on the site of an old priory, and though most of the site was destroyed by later development, the yard where the groundlings paid pennies to stand, drink, smoke and eat cherries and nuts \u2013 the remains of which have all been found on the site \u2013 remained as open ground under centuries of back gardens, though the exact location was lost. Shakespeare was with the Theatre by the time of one of the most famous escapades in stage history when Burbage\u2019s company, then run by his son, Richard, fell out with its landlord. They covertly demolished the Theatre and carried the timbers across the Thames to the even more rackety Bankside where the salvaged wood was used to build the much more famous Globe. The Shoreditch site was rediscovered in 2008 by archaeologists from the Museum of London working on a development. The modest remains of the brick and stone polygonal footings of the galleries allowed the shape of the Theatre to be mapped accurately for the first time, while seeds and fruit pips, nut shells and broken beer flagons gave a vivid picture of its everyday activities, in a rollicking area where court records show that brawls from nearby taverns and brothels frequently spread into the theatre itself. Archaeologists are now gathering up the last fragments from the site, which has become Hackney\u2019s first scheduled ancient monument. There is already street art evoking the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, and there will be a statue of Shakespeare commissioned from Raphael Maklouf and Hayley Gibbs. Theatre historian Julian Bowsher has quelled the cherished legend that the Theatre was demolished overnight at Christmas 1598, and the timbers spirited away and slid across the frozen Thames, so that the outraged landlord arrived back to find the a hole in the ground and the missing theatre rebuilt on Bankside. It would have taken much longer to dismantle the building, Bowsher says, and the Globe was much larger, not just a recreation of the Theatre. However, since building materials were very expensive, its timbers did indeed cross the Thames, and were recycled into the most renowned of all the Tudor theatres, which opened in 1599 and where Shakespeare would become one of the most famous playwrights in the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
