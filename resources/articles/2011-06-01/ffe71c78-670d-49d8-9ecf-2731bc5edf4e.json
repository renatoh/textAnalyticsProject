The concert, intended to present music of African-American origin to a mixed audience, was the brainchild of John Hammond, a scion of the Vanderbilt dynasty who had fallen in love with jazz during his youth. He worked as a jazz critic before beginning a distinguished career as an A&amp;R man, and was also active in the civil rights movement. The concert, and a second instalment held on Christmas Eve the following year, were representative of his inclusive taste, featuring the country blues performers Big Bill Broonzy and Sonny Terry, the \"blues shouter\" Big Joe Turner, the gospel singing of the Golden Gate Quartet and the boogie woogie pianists Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons alongside the bands of Count Basie and Benny Goodman and many others. Having had his requests for sponsorship turned down by many bodies, Hammond eventually secured backing from New Masses, a periodical produced by the American Communist party. The concerts would be seen as a milestone in the presentation and appreciation of jazz."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
