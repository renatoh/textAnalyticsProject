Sitting on the floor in her flat a few hundred yards from the spot where the 16-year-old was shot in the head on Wednesday night, Theresa Mfuilu said she could not understand why he had been killed. \"I am so very, very sad and upset,\" she said, sobbing. \"Jonathan is the only son I have in England and he was my light. My son is so very precious, he is my baby, he is everything for me.\" Jonathan's body was discovered behind a basketball court in a Sheffield park on Wednesday. He had been with friends when a gunman opened fire, scattering the group and killing Jonathan. Earlier in the day residents said there had been a running gun battle in nearby streets, with one group barricaded inside a house while another group took potshots. An 18-year-old was yesterday arrested on suspicion of murder after armed police carried out five raids across Sheffield. Chief Superintendent Jon House described the arrest as \"very significant\". Last night, a second 18-year-old, believed to be a local man, was arrested in connection with the death. Locals said the trouble was focused on a postcode war between rival gangs which had spilled over after three or four years of bad feeling. According to one gang member, Jay, feuding groups from the neighbouring S3 and S4 areas of Sheffield had clashed repeatedly in recent months, with shots being fired on several occasions. \"The dispute between the S3 and the S4 has got worse for months,\" said Jay, 20, a senior member of the S3 gang. \"It started years ago - maybe three - with a street dispute between two families. I think it could have been over something as small as an argument over a computer game. People's families and stuff get involved and it just spirals and this is where we have gotten to - someone dead. To be honest now no one really knows or talks about what started it now - it's just what it is.\" Sitting on the back of a bench in a park overlooking the boundary between the S3 and S4 postcodes a mile north of Sheffield city centre, Jay said the feuding gangs were based around two families and were made up of men aged between 16 and 30. \"There have been a lot of tit-for-tat things going on, from fights to throwing bottles and shootings - people just taking potshots in the street. When the shootings have been going on in last few weeks people have not taken it seriously.\" But he said Jonathan's death had made people think. \"I am scared now. I am paranoid walking down the street because this could happen to me or one of my friends.\" He said guns had slowly become more readily available in the Burngreave area, although they were still more difficult to get hold of than in other cities. \"It is not really that easy to get guns, not as easy as London or Manchester, but people can if they want. I can get one - it is easier than it was. \"I think everyone is a bit shocked about what happened because he was more in the wrong place at the wrong time than anything else. He was on the edges really, he was a good kid.\" Robert Smith, a community activist, said that many people had been predicting for weeks that someone would get killed or seriously hurt. \"I have had parents come to me and ask me for help because they are scared about what is going to happen to their children. There is a group that has been shooting another group over the last three or four months.\" Yesterday Ms Mfuilu described the last time she saw her son and repeated the call for witnesses to come forward. \"We said goodbye. I was going to church and he was going to the park. That was the last time I saw him ... I just ask, if anyone knows what happened, tell me, tell the police.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
