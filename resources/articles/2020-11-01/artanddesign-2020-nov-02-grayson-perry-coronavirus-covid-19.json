Too often, the audience for culture is just the people making it \u2013 theatres with whole audiences of actors, or exhibitions only put on to impress other curators.\u201d With new lockdown restrictions forcing museums and galleries to close again on Wednesday, the already bleak picture facing artists and staff at Britain\u2019s galleries and museums is set to get worse. The Southbank Centre is being forced to lose up to a third of its staff. The Victoria and Albert Museum and National Museums Liverpool have both announced plans to cut approximately 100 jobs. The National Trust is to cut 1,200 jobs. Many smaller institutions are also cutting positions, including the South London Gallery and the Chisenhale Gallery in east London. The majority of redundancies are coming from front-of-house and education staff. The Royal Academy is looking to lose over a hundred staff members. One artist, who preferred to remain anonymous given ongoing negotiations, but who works at the institution leading tours and education workshops, reacted angrily to Perry\u2019s comments. \u201cWhile Perry\u2019s views from his ivory tower may help the establishment and museum executives sleep at night it doesn\u2019t help the very real struggle of arts workers trying like everyone else to survive this pandemic. All workers need solidarity. Pre-Covid, the arts were thriving. It is disingenuous to diminish arts workers\u2019 contributions in the middle of a pandemic in which they are facing redundancy to gain cheap publicity and prop up the art elite.\u201d Perry was made Royal Academician in 2011 and in 2018 curated the annual open submission summer show. \u201cWith Covid, it\u2019s been like turning a computer off and on again, and seeing which files reappear. Some of them we don\u2019t really give a damn about. What\u2019s interesting is what might not re-emerge,\u201d Perry said. Another casual member of staff at the RA pointed out \u201cThose who lose out will be young, early career professionals; precisely the innovators and enactors of change that our industry badly needs. Sadly, I think the post-Covid the art scene will see white male household names at the fore again, because they make for reliable ticket receipts.\u201d Perry emerged in the 1990s, a flamboyant figure who garnered as many column inches for his transvestite alter-ego Claire, as his ceramics. In 2003 he won the Turner Prize. More recently he has fronted a series of well-received documentaries for Channel 4. \u201cGrayson\u2019s work often pokes fun at the liberal elite that buy it, but perhaps he\u2019s just coming full circle as he\u2019s joined their ranks.\u201d Sarah McCrory, director of Goldsmiths Centre of Contemporary Art, said. \u201cHis timing is disgraceful \u2026 I\u2019m not sure why he\u2019s so out of touch and unempathetic \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s because he\u2019s become the mainstream.\u201d Aaron Angell, who runs the Troy Town Pottery in London agrees Perry is disconnected from the reality of the impact of Covid-19. \u201cThe people losing their jobs are not the gang of cheek-kissing curators, but the invigilators, educators and hospitality staff that exist to make the museum more accessible. They are there to make the audience tackle work a bit more complicated than the words \u2018hate speech\u2019 written on a teapot.\u201d Perry\u2019s pots are typified by their ornate figurative decoration and pithy political and satirical slogans. In 2008 Perry curated an exhibition titled Unpopular Culture at the De La Warr Pavilion, celebrating a moment when \u201cmodern art was an even more rarefied activity, practiced and appreciated by other-worldly bohemians and intellectuals\u201d. Rosie Cooper, the art centre\u2019s curator today, said the art world now is very different, with great strides made in diversity in audiences and those working within the sector. The pandemic threatens this progress however. \u201cThe \u2018decimation\u2019 of culture has seen precarious workers hit hardest. As a result, many practitioners and artists will not be able to continue in their chosen careers without independent wealth. This will be an immense loss; these people are not \u2018dead wood\u2019.\u201d In the midst of the fury, Andrew Renton, who teaches curating at Goldsmiths College, called for a sense of solidarity in the sector. He agrees that the pandemic provides an opportunity to restock but also thinks Perry\u2019s viewpoint fundamentally wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to think about what art could and should do as a matter of urgency, right now, and in our anticipated recovery, rather than evoking the grim prospect of the survival of the fittest.\u201d Perry didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, but later tweeted: \u201cMy comments in an interview have been taken out of context. At this terrible time for the arts I\u2019d like to clarify that I was CERTAINLY not referring to the loss of people\u2019s jobs and opportunities in the arts, or to art galleries having to close due to the virus. I hope my hard work in support of the arts has shown how much I believe art is for us all and brings joy to amateurs and professionals alike. In times of hardship we need the arts more than ever.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
