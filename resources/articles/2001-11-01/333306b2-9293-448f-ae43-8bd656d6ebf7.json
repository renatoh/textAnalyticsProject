Global superclub the Ministry of Sound yesterday announced it had made a bid for four jets owned by Ansett, the country's struggling second airline. It wants to transform them into mobile clubs, flying hedonists to faraway parties before jetting them home in time for breakfast. Richard Mergler, Ministry of Sound's Australian brand director, said that the planes - staffed by Ansett employees threatened with redundancy - could provide punters with party drinks and pounding beats while travelling at 500mph. \"We're going to be doing Sydney-Melbourne to begin with. Special DJ decks will have been installed into where the business seats were,\" Mr Mergler said. Clubbers deemed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol would not be allowed to board the planes, Mr Mergler added. Australia would be a trial run for the jets. They would then be taken to Europe to be used by the Ministry of Sound's holiday division, which organises package tours flying British clubbers to their favourite party destinations, including Ibiza, Benidorm and Ayia Napa, where the club hosts regular nights under the Ministry brand. The planes could also be used to fly the Ministry of Sound's touring division around the world. The superclub has evolved from a nightclub into a global youth brand, selling dance music across the world and taking DJs on 300 club tours each year, encompassing America, Australia, India and China. Although it has recently shed 16 jobs, Ministry operates the biggest independent record label in Europe and has the financial muscle to purchase planes. Venture capitalist group 3i recently paid \u00a324m for a 20% stake in the business. But the feasibility of its bid for Ansett planes, which Mr Mergler said he lodged with the airline's administrators yesterday, remains up in the air. Ansett's fleet was grounded this year after Australia's civil aviation authority expressed concerns about the condition of its ageing Boeing 767s. The airline went into voluntary administration two months ago, a buyer has not yet been found for the airline, and most of its 16,000 staff are out of work. The prospect of dancers and the good vibrations pumped out by clubland's finest DJs in mid air is creating turbulence in the aviation world. John Anderson, Australia's transport minister and deputy prime minister, said Australia's aviation watchdog would need to study the safety implications of the Ministry of Sound's proposals for airborne DJs. \"That would take a lot of very careful consideration,\" he said. \"I don't think they would get an AOC [air operators certificate] overnight, put it that way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
