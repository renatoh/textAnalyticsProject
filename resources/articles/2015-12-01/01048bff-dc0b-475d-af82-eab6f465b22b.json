Having qualified unbeaten, Hodgson has vowed England will be hard to defeat in France next summer and said that being one of the five sides alongside the hosts in pot one had boosted their chances. \u201cThe beauty is that this good run of form has put us amongst the top seeds,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cThere was only five places, so it was good to get one of those five. So to be in that top pool and avoid five other very strong teams is obviously a very big advantage.\u201d England are in pot one with the holders Spain, the hosts, France, and the other three nations with the best Uefa coefficient rating at the end of the qualifying phase, Germany, Portugal and Belgium. Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are in pot four, making the prospect of two of the home nations meeting one another in the finals of a major tournament for the first time since Euro 96 \u2013 when England and Scotland were in the same group \u2013 a 50-50 chance. \u201cEven if you go down to the so-called weakest pool, there are lots of teams in there who are quite capable of beating the top seeds on their day,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cWitness Ireland against Germany, and that was in a qualifier not even a friendly,\u201d he added of the 1-0 victory that Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s side secured over the world champions in Dublin. \u201cThis is what we know we have there for us to confront, but it is still nicer to know that the top seeded teams we will avoid at least in the group stage.\u201d Hodgson entered the previous European Championship in Poland and Ukraine virtually free from expectation having succeeded Fabio Capello shortly before the tournament. At the World Cup in Brazil, England were eliminated after two matches. The England manager, whose contract is up at the end of the tournament but who wants to carry on to the 2018 World Cup in Russia, struck a more upbeat note before the draw. With 24 teams competing, they will be drawn into six groups of four teams. The top two from each group and the four third-place teams with the best records will advance to the knockout phase. Hodgson pointed to the fact that in 10 qualifying games England had conceded only three goals and that even in friendlies they had been hard to score against. In their most recent friendlies England were well beaten 2-0 in Spain and overcame France at Wembley in a match where the scoreline was rendered irrelevant by its proximity to the Paris terrorist attacks. \u201cWe\u2019re not an easy team to score past and beat, which is good news for the future, and I think we have some very good quality players in our front six, all of whom could win a game for us, so in terms of the make-up of our team I think we have reasons for optimism,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cBut the Euros are a tough one to win, there are lots of teams out there who look good on paper as well.\u201d As he begins to consider his squad for the final run of home friendlies, at least one of which is likely to be played away from Wembley, Hodgson also said Leicester City\u2019s in-form striker Jamie Vardy was in strong contention for a place in the starting lineup. Hodgson was full of praise for Vardy\u2019s feat in breaking the record for scoring in consecutive Premier League games and also praised his wider contribution to the team. \u201cHe has done it playing very much as a team player, so his contribution outside of the goals has been quite enormous,\u201d the coach said of the striker\u2019s remarkable run of form, which resulted in him on Friday being named player of the month for the second consecutive time. \u201cYou can\u2019t get a much better contribution than match-winning goals, but he has actually done an awful lot of running, chasing, making very good runs behind defenders, constantly being a thorn in the side of every defence he has played against and working his socks off defensively for Leicester to make sure that any lead they have got, they are able to keep.\u201d He hinted it was Vardy\u2019s capacity for hard work and ability to contribute defensively as well as in terms of goals that had put him in very real contention to make his preferred team in June. \u201cIt has been a remarkable rise and a remarkable success story and we can only hope that he can keep his form up. He won\u2019t score in every game between now and when I select a team for the Euros. But what he can do is continue to be Jamie Vardy, playing in the way Jamie Vardy does, and that is always going to make him a very strong contender.\u201d The Wales coach, Chris Coleman, said he was looking to avoid England in the draw and queried why his side had ended up in pot four, among the bottom seeds. \u201cIt is bizarre that we were top seeds for the World Cup draw and bottom seeds for this one,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the seedings came out for this and saw we were in pot four it did seem strange. \u201cBut I am confident with what we have got on our day \u2013 we can have a game with anyone. Some of the teams in pots above us will be looking at our form over the last two years and saying they don\u2019t want to play us.\u201d Coleman said that he hoped to avoid England because the hoopla surrounding the clash would act as a distraction from their goal. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we are afraid of England \u2013 we respect them very much but we are not afraid of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it would be a distraction. If you get four points you get out of the group. If we had England and had to play them first then it would be a distraction.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
