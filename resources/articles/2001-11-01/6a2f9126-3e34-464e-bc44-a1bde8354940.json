The need for an alternative city arose when the government pulled the plug on the plan to build a stadium at Pickett's Lock in north London. Sheffield, host city for the 1991 world student games, was put forward but the IAAF refused to accept the offer. A joint statement from the department for culture, media and sport, UK Athletics, Sheffield City Council, UK Sport, Sport England and the British Olympic Association explained that the decision by the IAAF had ended their consideration of making a bid. \"We are disappointed because we believe Sheffield would have staged a superb championships,\" said the statement. \"It was unanimously agreed that UK Athletics should not enter a Sheffield bid.\" The south Yorkshire city was expected to face competition from Rome, Madrid and Berlin. The Olympic winter games in Salt Lake City in February will be protected by a 50-mile no-fly zone and intruding aircraft risk being shot down. The International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said yesterday that unprecedented security measures will be taken following the September 11 terrorist attacks. With other high-ranking Olympic officials, he met the US president George Bush in Washington yesterday to discuss the security plans, which have a $370m (\u00a3261m) budget. He added that the Salt Lake bid corruption scandal, which led to 10 members quitting the IOC, had been a \"good thing\" in a paradoxical way. \"It has forced the IOC to modernise,\" he said. \"Every large organisation is naturally conservative. You need an external shock to put things in motion.\" Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec, the French former Olympic 200m and 400m champion who walked out on the Sydney games, has been refused permission to train at the stadium she inaugurated in her native Guadeloupe. An official at the Rivi\u00e8re des P\u00e8res stadium in Basse-Terre said: \"The champion had not asked for permission before coming and came at a time when the stadium was closed.\" The grand prix final will be held in Monte Carlo for the three years from 2003. In future the meeting will be staged over two days rather than one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
