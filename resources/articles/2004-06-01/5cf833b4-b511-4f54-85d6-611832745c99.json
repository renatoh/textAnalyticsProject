Creekside, Old Mill Creek, Dartmouth, Devon Landlubbers and sailing fanatics alike will love the views over the Dart estuary, but you'll have to be truly committed to 'messing about in boats' to take over the business as well. The attached boatyard, dealing mainly with the winter storage of vessels and with a turnover of \u00a347,584 in 2003, can be continued by the eventual buyer should they wish. Those who prefer dry land won't have much space to roost in the modest two-bed living accommodation, though there is planning permission for expansion. It's all up for auction on 17 June.

Pwll Crwn, Glynllifon, Gwynedd You could really lose yourself in this enchanting walled garden, originally built as the nursery to a local estate. Dating from the 1820s and planted with specimens from around the world, the gardens are still well-stocked and boast curiosities including a folly-like potting shed and the overgrown outlines of a maze. The Grade II-listed, hexagonal house - named 'Pwll Crwn', or 'Round Pond' - has three bedrooms, a number of reception rooms and an Edwardian conservatory. In addition to the eight-acre walled garden a further 7.6 acres of woodland are included in the sale.
