She cited frustration with the organisation's lack of funds as one of the main reasons. Speaking at the opening of the annual session of the UN human rights commission in Geneva, the former Irish president said: \"I believe that I can, at this stage, achieve more outside of the constraints that a multilateral organisation inevitably imposes.\" Her outspoken criticisms while in office made enemies of Russia, China, Algeria and other UN member states with poor human rights records. \"I've always recognised as high commissioner the importance of standing up to bullies, addressing short-comings and being outspoken, an awkward voice,\" she said yesterday. A spokesman at the UN in New York offered no immediate reaction to Mrs Robinson's criticisms of the constraints she has encountered, but heexpression of frustration will not help the UN. Its reputation has taken a battering in recent years, especially for shortcomings in peacekeeping. Groups such as Human Rights Watch expressed regret yesterday and urged Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, to appoint someone as strong as Mrs Robinson. Amnesty International said: \"Mary Robinson is a courageous and committed campaigner for human rights who recognises that a quiet word was not always the best way to get results. She is not someone who shied away from criticising human rights abuses just because they occurred in countries that were politically and economically powerful.\" She told Mr Annan recently that she intended to stand down in September rather than seek a second four-year term. UN sources said she would have had Mr Annan's wholehearted support had she stood again, though some in siders claimed her departure would not be calamitous as she was a poor manager. Although she succeeded in doubling her section's budget during her four years in office, she said it was not enough and she was troubled that most field workers were on insecure contracts. The office receives 2% of the UN's annual budget. \"I believe it is one of the major disconnects between the eloquence and fine language used by so many representatives of governments in speaking about human rights and the fact that the core budget allocates less than 2% to human rights work. Something has to change there,\" she said. UN member states subjected to criticism can retaliate by blocking budget increases. In 1997, an Algerian official warned that the human rights office's work would become difficult after Mrs Robinson criticised massacres in his country. In the following months Algeria and other countries hampered budget extensions during meetings in New York. Their tactics seemed to have the desired effect. Mrs Robinson's readiness to name governments in public was tempered. She contrasted the rhetoric of some UN members and the reality of victims and human rights defenders on the ground. \"Some of those who have talked about human rights being politicised happen to be representatives of governments that have a very poor human rights record. This is an important factor\", she said. The commission is expected at its annual session to discuss abuses of which China, Russia and Israel are accused."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
