Back tomorrow, for another day of market drama - plus the latest eurozone growth figures, starting with France at 6.30am GMT. Here\u2019s our latest news story: Better get some sleep :) Goodnight! GW Today\u2019s selloff in Asia, Europe and America have pulled global stocks into bear market territory. Reuters has the details: Stock indexes worldwide stumbled on Thursday on fears over the health of the global economy, with a global equity benchmark index closing the day more than 20 percent below its record high last May, confirming global stocks are in a bear market. MSCI\u2019s all-country world equity index which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last down 4.73 points, or 1.32%, to 353.35. The index hit its lowest level in more than two and a half years and was down 20.18% from an all-time high close of 442.70 on May 21, 2015. As we\u2019ve been covering today, this fall into bear market territory began with hefty losses in Hong Kong. Its stock market fell by 4%, on the first day\u2019s trading since the Lunar New year holiday. The baton then passed to Europe, which fumbled it. Bank shares had a very poor day indeed, on escalating fears that they will struggle to handle an economic slowdown, and lower negative interest rates. In nervous trading, shares slumped and government bonds soared, while oil took a dive and gold rallied. That tee\u2019d up America for its fifth daily fall in a row, as Fed chair Janet Yellen repeated her concerns that financial conditions are deteriorating. Uncertainty over US monetary policy going forward - will rates be hiked, cut, or even go negative? - weighed on shares again. It looks like the S&amp;P 500 has finished at its lowest closing level since April 2014, at 1829 points. Financial shares in the S&amp;P fell by 3%, bringing 2016 losses to roughly 18%, points out our US business editor Dominic Rushe. Here\u2019s the main movers and shakers: The Dow has lost around 4.6% of its value since last Thursday - the last time it posted a daily rise. The index is down 10.1% since the start of this year. This is the fifth day running in which the Dow Jones index has lost ground. Reminder: Tonight\u2019s losses in New York follow another day\u2019s torrid trading in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has another day to forget, losing 2.4% as investors raced for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the yen, and gold. The Footsie, which includes the top 100 companies in London, closed at its lowest level in three and a half years. Our friends at the Daily Telegraph have worked out that \u00a380bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 index this week. And there\u2019s still one day to go.... Phew! America\u2019s stock market has closed for the night, and the main three indices are all in the red. The Dow ended the day down around 251 points, having clawed back from a 400-point loss an hour or so ago. And the Nasdaq wilted in the final moments, surrendering earlier gains to finish down 0.4%. Shares picked up after the WSJ reported that Opec might be prepared to cut oil production. But financial stocks dragged again, with Goldman Sachs down 4.1%, and JP Morgan losing 3.98%. The biggest Dow faller was Boeing, following reports that regulators are investigating the airline maker. The latest research note from French Bank BNP Paribas just landed in my inbox. Here\u2019s their \u2018big picture\u2019 view: Central-bank action looks uncoordinated and we see few signs of calm ahead. We expect no further action from the Fed in 2016 or 2017 and we think central banks across the world will continue to adopt easier policies in response. It looks like traders are trying to give the Dow a late push. It\u2019s now down 188 points, or half its earlier losses..... Hello hello.... look at the Nasdaq. The tech stock-heavy index has shrugged off its earlier losses, and is now up 7 points (or 0.2%). Leading the way are: TripAdvisor: +13% Cisco +10% Expedia +8.5% Tesla: +6.3% That still leaves the Nasdaq down 6.9% this month, and 13% since the start of the year. Now that today\u2019s OPEC rumour has sunk in, Wall Street is still in red, but off its lowest levels. The Dow is currently down 273 points, or -1.7%, with just 40 minutes until the closing bell. This final hour can be a volatile time.... This is the story that moved the market a few minutes ago, by Summer Said of the Wall Street Journal. OPEC members are ready to cooperate on a cut, but current prices are already forcing producers outside the group to at least cap output increases, says UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei. Non-OPEC supplies are expected to drop up to 800K barrels/day while global demand growth is seen at 1.3M\u2013which will help the market balances itself. \u201cThe positive thing is the current market is forcing everyone not to increase output,\u201d says al-Mazrouei, adding, \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the balance will happen this year despite the oversupply and stocks overhang.\u201d  Interesting stuff. But it\u2019s not exactly definitive proof that OPEC is about to cave in and axe production. Energy stocks are suddenly spiking, pulling the US stock market off its lowest levels. And it\u2019s triggered reports that the energy minister of the UAE has said Opec members are \u201cready to co-operate\u201d on production cuts. Rumours of this sort have been swirling, and then denied, for some time. But maybe this time it\u2019s different.... Wow. The Dow just lurched through the 400-point loss mark, as news of the latest tumble in the oil price broke. Then it ricocheted back, to \u201cjust\u201d 340 points down in a few moments. Oil has just plumbed new depths, as oversupply fears and global recession worries take their toll again. West Texas Intermediate (US crude oil) has sunk below $26.19 per barrel, to hit the lowest levels since May 2003. There\u2019s no let-up in the market gloom today, with the Dow Jones industrial average still down over 2%. The Dow is currently trading at 15,570, a loss of 344 points. Only two stocks are up - network equipment vender Cisco, and entertainment group Walt Disney (who posted strong results earlier this week). Boeing is the big faller; the aircraft maker has lost 8.9% today following reports that regulators are probing the company\u2019s accounting. Reuters also blames \u201cmounting concerns\u201d about Boeing\u2019s its slowing sales and production. Following close behind in the losers bench are Goldman Sachs (-4.4%) and JP Morgan (-4.2%). They\u2019re tracking the general sell-off in financial stocks today. Two months after the first US rate rise in a decade, the financial markets reckon the Fed is more likely to CUT, rather than risk a second hike. Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at Societe Generale, reckons that the market turmoil has been sparked by a loss of faith in central bankers. In a new note to clients, he writes: We\u2019ve relied on central bankers to fix all the world\u2019s woes, when all they could really do was to get the global financial system back on an even keel. Keeping policy too easy for too long and boosting asset markets in the vain hope that this would deliver a sustainable demand pick-up has meant that even a timid attempt at normalising Fed policy has caused two months of mayhem. Now, a growing realisation that central banks\u2019 powers are waning has prompted a rush into safe havens. And, of course, years of ultra-loose monetary policy have also led us to this point: We\u2019re just getting the stickers saying \u2018Easy Money may cause harmful side-effects if consumed persistently for long periods\u2019 printed.... Yellen\u2019s second and final testimony ends with chairman Richard Shelby suggesting a review of the Fed\u2019s structure. She seems unconvinced but says it is up to Congress. And with that it\u2019s over. A cocktail of concerns has sent markets tumbling again. Worries about a severe global economic downturn, stresses on bank balance sheets, the falling oil price and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments about the impact of a slowdown and the market turmoil on the US economy have sent investors scurrying away to havens such as gold. Yellen\u2019s comments about negative interest rates added to the unease as the afternoon wore on. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 135.33 points or 2.39% to 5536.97, its lowest level since the end of July 2012 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.93% to 8752.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 4.03% lower at 3896.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 5.63% at 15,773.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.88% at 7746.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.89% to 440.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 349 points or 2.2%. Charles Schumer of New York says the strength of the US dollar is another form of rates rise so another hike would be a double whammy for the economy. Yellen says the dollar is a factor in interest rate policy, but says although some sectors have been hit by the strength of the US currency the economy has managed to continue creating jobs. Heller: A year ago you said falling oil would be good for the economy. Do you think you made a mistake. Yellen: Clearly declining oil prices have had some negative effects [on the economy]. [But] we are still a net importer of oil, and households are seeing sustantial gains from falling oil price. Dean Heller of Nevada: Different Fed officials saying different things causes confusion to public and markets. Do you see a problem? Yellen: Congress created a system with a large committee with diverse views so we did not fall into groupthink mentality. We have 17 members with a range of views. We have guidelines for communications. It says everyone should make clear they are speaking for themselves, not the committee. The market response to the Fed rate decision for a number of weeks was tranquil, it had been communicated and was expected. At the turn of the year markets saw more volatility. The drivers were China and oil price falls amid weakening global growth, so I don\u2019t think it was our policy. Yellen is asked again about the rate rise at the end of last year. Yellen: We felt in December the economy was moving up and inflation would go up. A lot has gone on since then. We are in the process of assessing how those developments affect our outlook. We will meet in March and have a new set of projections. I\u2019ve not thought that a downturn sufficient to make the next move a cut was a likely possibility. Not seen a shift in economic outlook to make that likely. But she added that if things changed to make that appropriate, the Fed would look at it. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asks about living wills for banks, which are designed to make sure if they fail there will not be a systemic risk, and says there are 11 where they were deemed not to be sufficient and have been resubmitted. Yellen: We gave detailed guidance about what we want to see in these latest rounds of living wills. We are..evaluting them. If a living will does not address the shortcomings, we are prepared to make the finding that the living will is insufficient. Tom Cotton of Arkansas asks the December rate rise, and Yellen says the Fed wanted to move gradually so that the economy remained on a sustainable growth path. Cotton then asks about when she expects energy prices and the dollar to stabilise. Yellen: Energy prices have continued to move down, eventually they will stabilise. When that happens and the dollar stabilises, inflation will begin to move up but [difficult to predict when.] Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania: I wanted the Fed to normalise policy [ie start raising rates again which happened in December]. Markets now appear to price in no further increases in interest rates. But what are the risks of negative rates? [He lists several including pressure on banks, the prospect of currency war, an effective tax on savings and so on] Yellen: In European countries which have [introduced negative rates], I was surprised it was possible to take them as negative as they did. Don\u2019t think they pass on negative rates to small depositors, which means bank\u2019s margins are squeezed. They [other central banks] were concerned about inflation being below objectives and wanted to stimulate economy. In our context, in 2010 we were concerned about the impact on money market functioning. Before we took such a step we would have to see how they worked in US context. But we don\u2019t even know if clearing and settlement systems would be able to handle negative rates. Toomey asks about the legal position, saying a Fed memo seemed to suggest there could be a probem. Yellen: A memo from 2010 said legal issues had not been studied. I am not aware of any legal restriction that would mean we could not establish negative rates but I haven\u2019t studied legal side of it. Question from Bob Corker of Tennessee : Is Fed out of ammunition unless you go to negative rates? If things go south are you considering negative rates? Yellen: The answer is we had previously considered them and decided they would not work well back in 2010. In light of others [introducing them], we are taking a look at them again because we would want to be prepared. We have not finished that investigation. Not automatic they would work well here. I would not take them off the table, but there is work to do to see if they would be suitable. Senator Jon Tester of Montana: What is Fed seeing in housing sector right now? Yellen: We are seeing recovery in housing, it has gone on for a number of years but is very gradual. House prices have increased quite a bit. [But] the level of new construction remains quite low relative to demographic trends. Quite a significant way for housing to go before it is consistent with demographic trends. It is a support to the economy. Senator Mike Crapo asks: Would you agree liquidity in bond markets may be less available in stressed market conditions. Yellen: Normal conditions haven\u2019t changed that much but perceptions suggest that under stressed conditions liquidity may disappear when its most needed. We are looking at these things... Asked about wages, she says a pick up in wage growth is tentative. She hopes as the economy improves this will increase. Chair Richard Shelby asks if the precipitous decline in the price of 0il and gas plus the rise of the dollar surprised the Fed or could you have predicted it? Yellen says the Fed and the markets have been quite surprised by movements in oil price. In part they reflect supply isssue, demand may also play a role. The stronger dollar we in some ways anticipated as US economy has been performing more strongly than others. But she says they were surprised at how much it has risen. Asked about the economy and recession, she says there is always some chance of recession in any year. But evidence suggests expansions don\u2019t die of old age. We are looking very carefully at global financial developments which create risk... they may influence the trajectory of the economy and monetary policy. It is premature to make a judgement [on a recession this year]. On the strength of banks: We have a more resistent banking system. We have used stress tests to see if firms can support credit needs of our economy even in times of great [financial] stress. We do have a strong banking system and we\u2019ve seen marked improvement. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the chances of a Fed rate rise have dropped sharply since January in the wake of the market turmoil and Yellen\u2019s comments: After opening comments from committee chair Richard Shelby and senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is currently delivering her testimony (identical to yesterday\u2019s speech remember). Meanwhile markets seem to have recovered a little from their worst levels. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline. In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively. The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress. The hearing has begun and can be viewed here. Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut: As predicted, the US market has followed the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 243 points or 1.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 1% and Nasdaq 1.3%. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that Christine Lagarde has been nominated for a second five year term as managing director unopposed. Her first term ends in July. Well, here\u2019s the answer to the question about whether Janet Yellen would change her testimony from Wednesday\u2019s remarks in the light of the day\u2019s renewed market turmoil. No. The Fed said: Chair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 11, 201. So if you want to read along with Yellen at 10am EST (3pm GMT) here it is again. Here\u2019s some comments on Portugal and Greece from Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr ahead of the eurogroup: Bloomberg points out another possible reason behind the plunge in bank shares: Oil rich Gulf states have of course been hard hit by the plunge in crude prices. Now here\u2019s a key question about today\u2019s second testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen: Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are telling reporters that the European banking sector is in good shape, as they arrive for a Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem revealed that ministers will consider the market turbulence during today\u2019s session. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici was pretty optimistic too: And Finnish finance minister Alex Stubb was \u201crelaxed\u201d about the situation: Out of the mists of gloom comes some good news, in the shape of the weekly US jobless figures. They show that the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell by 16,000 last week, to a seven-week low. The initial jobless claims figure came in at 269,000, down from 280,000. So, US companies kept hiring staff last week, despite the market turmoil. World stock markets are gripped by another bout of feverish selling today. Fears over the global economy and the financial sector have hit shares, driven down (most) sovereign bond yields, and sent wild gyrations through the foreign exchange markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a three and a half-year low. The blue-chip index is currently down 120 points, or 2%. Financial stocks are under real pressure, with Aberdeen Asset Management, Prudential and Barclays all down 6%. Other European markets are being routed too, with the French CAC plunging by 3.5%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB losing 5%(!) and German DAX off by 2%. Wall Street is expected to follow suit, with the Dow being called down 280 points or almost 2%. The day began with a big selloff in Asia, as traders returned after the Lunar New Year. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market slid by 4%. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says investors face volatile markets: \u201cFebruary has continued much like January begun, with markets yo-yoing and investor sentiment swinging from one concern to the next. The FTSE 100 broke the 5,500 barrier today \u2013 hitting a new low since July 2012. \u201cInvestors can\u2019t be blamed for feeling unnerved. There is a cocktail of worries clouding the investment horizon from a slowing China, emerging market rout, the unprecedented collapse in the oil prices and more recently, the problems brewing in the banking sector. Bank shares are in the eye of the storm again: France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has tumbled by 13% after warning that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hit profitability this year. Deutsche Bank is down by 9%, two days after insisting it was \u201crock-solid\u201d. The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen, before suddenly rebounding, sparking rumours that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken its currency. And the British pound has fallen by over a cent against the US dollar to $1.439. Money has poured into German, US and UK government debt. This has driven down Britain\u2019s cost of borrowing to an alltime low. But Portugal\u2019s bonds have weakened, sparking fears that investors are worrying about Lisbon again. Sweden\u2019s central bank fired another shot in the currency wars, surprising the markets by slashing interest rates to a new record low of minus 0.5%. The oil price has weakened again, with US crude oil trading at levels last seen in 2003. But gold has jumped by 2.6% to $1,229 per ounce, a nine-month high. Financial sentiment right now: A rumour is sweeping the trading floors that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken the yen, following today\u2019s surge against the US dollar. And the yen has weakened, moving from \u00a5111.5 to \u00a5112 against the $1. America is waking up to the news that Asian and European markets have taken another bath this morning. And they are next in line: Investors are ditching Portuguese government bonds this morning, as the financial turmoil grows. The wave of selling has driven up the yield on Portugal\u2019s 10-year bonds to 4.3%, up from 3.5% yesterday. That\u2019s a remarkable surge, meaning that prices have dropped sharply. It implies that the markets are losing confidence in Portugal again, demanding a higher rate of return for holding its bonds. Shorter-term Portuguese debt is also being hit. The move comes as Lisbon\u2019s new left-wing government begins to reverse some of its predecessor\u2019s austerity policies. Last week, the EU warned that Portugal was \u201cat risk\u201d of breaching Europe\u2019s fiscal rules, after warily approving its 2016 budget. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons fear is driving shares down today, rather than a fundamental shift. He says: The fear surrounding global financial markets has been cranked up further today, as risk assets once more took a battering in favour of defensive plays. The continued deterioration in the FTSE is as much to do with the ongoing fall in oil and the fall in the US dollar against the yen, as the outlook for the UK economy itself, yet with markets in freefall, who is going to argue with a trend? There are many potential causes of the current rout. For example: signs of slowing global growth; fears that negative interest rates severely undermine bank profitability; the bad loans lurking in the European financial sector; suspicions that China is much weaker than the GDP figures show.... All good reasons to worry. But as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Juliet Samuel flags up, the City isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s really behind it. In a morning of wild and alarming moves, one stands out. The Japanese yen has jumped by 1.7% against the US dollar today, strengthening from \u00a5113.3 to $1, to \u00a5111.5. That\u2019s a chunky daily move. And so far this year, the yen has gained by 7.5% against the US dollar, hitting its strongest point since November 2014. That will surely concern the Bank of Japan, which imposed negative rates last month in its latest attempt to stimulate growth and inflation. A stronger yen is bad for exports, and also deflationary as it makes imported goods cheaper. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The US dollar printed a fresh 16-month low against the Japanese yen, suggesting that traders believe the BoJ will be unable to further weaken the yen, while betting the Fed will remain sidelined for a longer period of time. But there is also chatter that the BoJ may have to intervene in the markets to weaken the yen. Here, courtesy of David Buik of Panmure Gordon, is a snapshot of the day\u2019s rout (so far) in the banking sector: Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have now hit their lowest level since the late 1600s, thanks to the plunge in bond yields today (details here). So reckons Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, who has checked the historic data. It\u2019s unlikely that Britain\u2019s medieval kings could have borrowed any cheaper either. They were notorious serial defaulters, due to the demands of court life and military ambitions. Mind you, academics at the University of Reading have argued that the picture was more nuanced.... They wrote: It can be difficult to identify medieval interest rates, in part because interest charges had to be disguised to circumvent the Church prohibition on usury, but we found that the king could borrow at 15% annualised interest when his finances were stable but that this could increase to more than 40% during periods of financial pressure, most notably during wartime. Edward I probably had a surplus on his account with the Ricciardi, who collapsed as the result of a \u2018credit crunch\u2019 caused by the unexpected outbreak of war between England and France..... More here: Credit Finance in the Middle Ages: loans to the English crown c.1272-1340 The Greek stock market is suffering another rout, led by its banks: Oil is being thumped by predictions of a growing crude glut, as the world economy slows. The price of US crude has fallen by almost 3% today, to $26.74 per barrel. That\u2019s a one-month low, but also close to the levels ploughed in 2003: Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde tweets the details: The refusal of oil producers to cut production is fuelling concerns that we may run out of places to put the stuff, as inventory levels keep rising. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The threat of further rate hikes from the Fed coupled with diminished prospects for a joint production cut between OPEC and non-OPEC producers have sent US oil prices back down to 12-year lows. The renewed slump in the price of oil has been unfortunate timing for French oil giant Total to report a 20% rise in annual net profits which CEO Patrick Pouyanne proclaimed as the \u201cbest performance\u201d amongst the oil majors. Today\u2019s rout has driven European bank shares down to their lowest level in three and a half years. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which includes the main lenders in Europe, has shed 6.1% and is now at its lowest level since August 2012. Summer 2012 was the point at which the eurozone debt crisis began to ease, with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi vowing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Today\u2019s rout is being led by Italian banks, and French bank SocGen (after its results missed forecasts today). Britain\u2019s government borrowing costs have just hit an all-time low, according to Reuters data. The yield on 10-year UK gilts, which are the benchmark for UK borrowing, has fallen to 1.29% this morning in a wave of buying. Yield, the interest rate on the debt, fall when prices rise. So this implies Britain can borrow cheaper than at any time before (the data I can see goes back to 1989) That sounds like good news, except that it reflects wider fears over a global recession. If traders were upbeat about growth prospects, they\u2019d be buying shares instead. Investors are scrambling into \u201csafer\u201d eurozone government bonds. That\u2019s another sign that they\u2019re seeking protection against recession and market turmoil. German government bond yields (the interest rate on bunds) has hit a nine-month low this morning - meaning the prices of these bonds has hit the highest level since May 2015. And the yield on US 10-year Treasury bills has hit its lowest in three years, at just 1.62%. That also suggests traders are pessimistic about future growth and inflation prospects. Bank shares are getting a tonking this morning. Deutsche Bank, the source of so much worry, is down by 6.3% in Frankfurt, with Commerzbank close behind. After a rough start to trading, European stock markets are deep and turbulent sea of red. Italy is the worst performer, with its FTSE MIB index slumping by over 4%: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is partly to blame. He reckons investors are disappointed that Yellen didn\u2019t rule out interest rate rises, when she appeared at Congress yesterday: Although the economic environment has transformed for the worst since the start of the year with ongoing China woes and violent declines in oil prices exposing the US economy to downside risks, in defiance the Fed continues to hold the view of raising rates at a gradual pace. While Yellen also emphasized that financial conditions in the US have become less supportive of growth, this was counterbalanced with the impressive labour report which in the eyes of the Fed opened doors for a potential rate rise in March. Yellen will get a second bite at the cherry later today, when she continues testifying to US lawmakers. Wall Street is expected to take a tumble later today: Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities in Abu Dhabi says: Asia and Europe equities remain weak following the Feds acknowledgment that they have concerns over global markets. European financial risk indices continue to rise, which is keeping demand high for safe haven assets. Ahead of the open we\u2019re currently calling the DOW down 275 15640 and the S&amp;P down 32 at 1820 Sweden\u2019s central bank has cut the country\u2019s interest rates deeper into negative territory, in another sign of the turbulence in the financial world. The Riksbank has just announced that the headline rate will fall to -.50%, from -0.35%. The move is designed to drive inflation up and stimulate growth. The bank says: The economy continues to strengthen but inflation is expected to be lower during 2016 than previously forecast. The rate cut will also weaken the Swedish currency. It is already hitting the Swedish Krone hard, sending the euro surging against the krone. Only 3 economists surveyed by Bloomberg has expected such a deep cut (8 thought rates would stay at minus 0.35%, and 7 predicted a cut to minus 0.45%) Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet Direct, says fears over the world economy are hitting shares hard, and also pushing the oil price down. Any hopes that yesterday\u2019s modest rally for the FTSE-100 would mark something of a turning point have been dashed. WTI crude oil prices tested territory below $27/barrel, whilst the return to work after the Lunar New Year break saw traders in Hong Kong lacked any signs of optimism. Janet Yellen\u2019s words yesterday have clearly done nothing to calm sentiment \u2013 yes the next US rate hike may have been pushed back, but the challenge now is managing the US recovery against a potential global slowdown. The London selloff is accelerating, wiping 130 points off the Footsie. The index of major blue-chip shares has now hit its lowest level since July 2012: Over in Paris, French bank Societe Generale has plunged by 9%. It missed City forecasts this morning, with net income coming in around 31% below analyst forecasts. SocGen also warned that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hamper its efforts to hit profitability targets this year. That wipes out yesterday\u2019s recovery: Money is pouring into safer assets, and out of shares. The gold price has risen to $1,211 per ounce, its highest since May 2015. And the Japanese yen has hit its highest level against the British pound since November 2013. Down we go again! European shares are falling at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has shed 101 points, or 1.7%, to 5,570 points. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1.5%, and the French CAC is off by 1.6% Most London shares are down, but mining stocks are leading the selloff reflecting ongoing gloom about the global economy. Rio Tinto has slumped by 6.7%, after it abandoned its \u201cprogressive dividend\u201d policy this morning (a promise to pay more shareholders in future years). This follows a late-selloff on Wall Street last night, and the slumps in Asia earlier today. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The weakness stems from Fed chair Janet Yellen warning on current financial market turbulence and suggesting further rate hikes could be delayed, which added to already raised anxiety about the health of the global economy to hold back risk sentiment. It\u2019s never great returning to work after a holiday. But the mood in Hong Kong was particularly grim, as investors watched shares tumble. Nitin Dialdas, chief investment officer at Mandarin Capital in Hong Kong, told Reuters that 2016 will be tough. \u201dI think this is going to be a difficult year for investors and even a fledgling U.S. economic recovery looks to be snuffed out by global markets development.\u201d Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock exchange, was also gloomy: \u201cThere is very little good news and continuous bad news and this is a test of market confidence.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is suffering its worst start to the Lunar New Year since 1994. A wave of selling has hit shares as traders return to their desks after this week\u2019s holiday. They were swift to catch up with the turmoil in European and US markets, with Asian markets having been shut since Friday. The Hang Seng index has lurched down, losing 795 points or nearly 4% to 18,535. That\u2019s its biggest one-day loss in six months. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, that\u2019s the worst start to a Lunar New Year in over two decades: There were similar losses in other Asian markets. South Korea\u2019s Kospi staged its biggest daily drop in nearly four years, down 2.9 percent to finish at 1,861.54. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney, blamed fears over the global slowdown, and the oil price slump, adding: \u201cWhat started in January as mainly China based worries has clearly broadened back out to concerns about global growth\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no end in sight to the market turmoil. European stocks are expected to fall at the start of trading, with worries over the global slowdown centre-stage again. The futures market suggests the main indices, including London\u2019s FTSE 100, will lose around 1% at the opening - wiping out Wednesday\u2019s small rally. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress for the second day running (at 3pm GMT). She\u2019ll probably repeat her concerns about the turmoil in the markets, which could prevent the Fed from hiking rates this year. We\u2019ll hear from another central bank today, too. At 8.30am, Sweden\u2019s Riksbank announces its monetary policy decision, and some economists believe it will cut interest rates deeper into negative territory. And Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels; Greece\u2019s struggling bailout talks will be on the agenda, as Athens and its creditors continue to argue over its austerity plan. In the corporate world. oil giant Total, holiday firm Thomas Cook, insurance group Zurich and mining giant Rio Tinto are all reporting results (more on them shortly....) We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
