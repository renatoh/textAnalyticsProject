Coping with the expectations aroused by success is sometimes more difficult than rising above failure. A few seconds after England had kicked off, Steven Gerrard, one of the heroes of Munich, gave the ball away. It took his colleagues a minute to regain possession. Another minute later Gerrard committed an unnecessary foul in the centre circle. Almost everything England did until Michael Owen gave them the lead a couple of minutes before half-time was a direct reaction to the events of four days earlier. Gerrard's combination of overconfidence and overcommitment, the transparent altruism of Owen's desire to set up Emile Heskey in the seventh minute after tricking his way past two defenders on the right-hand edge of the Albanian penalty area, and the tentative covering of Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand when faced with the presence of a single attacker - they were all a part of the same predictable syndrome. The players were showing their youth and their unfamiliarity with the phenomenon that has overtaken them since they touched down at Newcastle airport in the early hours of Sunday. Even those, like David Beckham, who have won the European Cup, or, like Owen and Gerrard, have taken home five trophies in the last year, found themselves unprepared for what they faced last night. Suddenly they are expected to be a combination of the England of 1966 and the Brazil of 1970, a team of all the talents, who have only to turn up in order to assert their right to conquer. But they are not there yet - nor anywhere near it, as Sven-Goran Eriksson tries to remind them while he tries to keep their feet on the ground without dampening their aspirations or their self- belief. But this was also a significant test for the Swedish coach. To have won the adoration of an entire people so swiftly and comprehensively is a new experience for him, too. It would be interesting to know what he really thinks of a nation apparently so ready - pathetically ready, some might think - to be carried away. And it will be even more interesting to see how he responds when his team finds itself in serious trouble in a match where defeat means elimination. Steve McManaman, in his newspaper column yesterday, attempted to summarise the effect of Eriksson's arrival on the England dressing room. At 29, and a senior figure in the squad, McManaman is in a position to make worthwhile comparisons with the recent past but his observations perhaps said more about the new coach's methods than he knew. \"As funny as it sounds,\" the Real Madrid man wrote, \"not much has changed in the England camp since the first game of our World Cup qualifying campaign under Kevin Keegan. Day to day the logistics of being in the England squad are the same and it's the same on the pitch, too. \"We play in the same 4-4-2 formation that was considered 'na\u00efve' under Keegan.\" The difference, McManaman felt, was that certain young players have established themselves and that the rest have simultaneously found form and fitness. \"Sometimes that just happens,\" he wrote. \"A team clicks into place.\" No doubt he believes that, and perhaps the other players do as well. His view reminded me of something said on the subject 25 centuries ago by Lao Tzu, a contemporary of Confucius. \"The best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence to his subjects,\" he wrote in the Tao Te Ching. \"Hesitant, he does not utter words lightly. When his task is accomplished and his work done the people all say, 'It happened to us naturally'.\" As far as McManaman is concerned, what has happened to the England squad has happened naturally. Eriksson's gift is to lead without making his players feel led. In the hands of someone who knows what he is doing, it is a far better method than those ascribed by Lao Tzu to the lesser categories of ruler: the one who is loved, the one who is feared, and the one with whom liberties are taken. We can all find a recent England manager to fit each of those stereotypes. Of the outfield players who started last night's match for England, only Beckham appeared unaffected by the changed public mood. He harried and cajoled and invented as he has done ever since he was given the captain's armband, and his value to Eriksson is inestimable. But it was Owen who, after one or two false alarms, reassured the English public that Saturday had not been a Munich mirage after all. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
