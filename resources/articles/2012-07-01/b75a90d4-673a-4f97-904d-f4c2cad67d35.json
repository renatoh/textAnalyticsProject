Happily, however, several of the movie's other stars are still alive 73 years on, as the striking presence on the Guardian's list of weekend birthdays of Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie Hamilton and who was 96 on Sunday, confirms. Miss de Havilland's longevity is remarkable in other ways too, since her equally distinguished sister Joan Fontaine, star of Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 Rebecca, is also still alive at 94. To claim that a famous feud between the two sisters may have helped fuel their mutual survival would be speculation, but it is a pleasure to discover that, for the de Havilland sisters and for a few other select Manderley and Tara veterans, tomorrow is indeed still another day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
