You spend 23 hours a day in your cell. You get books out of the library that have the last 20 pages missing. You get visits if the officers can be bothered. You get mail when they can be bothered. It's just a warehouse for people. Fortunately I spent most of my sentence in HMP North Sea Camp which is an open prison. The buildings are a mess but the way it's run and the resources available are fantastic, and it's probably got the lowest re-conviction rates of all prisons. You've got to work because if you refuse they take you back to the local prison; there's a big farm which supplies the prison service with food and an excellent education department where I worked as a tutor, teaching basic skills to inmates who couldn't read or write. I witnessed two ends of the spectrum when it came to drugs, too. I only saw drugs once at North Sea Camp and it was jumped on that hard that nobody would dare. At Leeds, you only have to look at the inmates to see there is a huge problem. There's almost a tacit approval of heroin because it isn't picked up easily in tests and the officers would rather just leave the addicts to it because that way they give less grief. At night, I saw one syringe doing the whole side of a wing. They'd drop the needle into a tin, hang it outside the window on a piece of string and swing it round. The inmate in the next cell would catch it, use the needle and send it on. The other problem is that the prison service doesn't recognise homosexuals exist. I'm gay and when I arrived at Leeds, I was asked by a senior officer: \"Are you a raving queen or can you keep it to yourself?\" If you did admit to being a \"raving queen\", you'd end up separated from the other prisoners for your own protection. The trouble is the separate wing is generally for sex offenders, so any gay man who goes there is seen as a sex offender which is a big problem. A chap I know of came out of a protected wing, was raped, then contracted HIV. There really needs to be some policy movement in that area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
