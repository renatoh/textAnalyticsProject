The contract was published after the FAI took a barrage of criticism over its decision to abandon public protest in favour of confidential money. It details a series of meetings involving FAI chiefs and the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, following Ireland\u2019s 2-1 loss on aggregate to France thanks, in part, to a pivotal handball by Thierry Henry that produced the winning goal. The document, signed 15 January, 2010, by senior FAI and Fifa officials in Switzerland, guaranteed the FAI immediate delivery of \u20ac5m on strict condition that Irish officials never revealed existence of the deal. A detailed description of the events leading up to the payout released by the FAI on Friday made repeated reference to Blatter\u2019s comments at a major soccer conference days after the game, which enraged Irish fans, as a factor in the payout. \u201cSepp Blatter made a joke of the Association\u2019s request to be the 33rd team at the World Cup \u2026 in direct breach of agreed confidentiality and subsequently brought reputational damage to the FAI,\u201d the FAI said in a statement. \u201cSepp Blatter personally apologised to the FAI delegation for the remarks,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAfter negotiation, FIFA offered the FAI a 5 million euro interest free loan by way of compensation.\u201c The FAI also published letters showing the money entering the association\u2019s Dublin bank accounts five days later and being quickly deployed to reduce the association\u2019s stadium-building debts. The FAI also published a June 2014 letter from Fifa\u2019s deputy secretary general, Markus Kattner, informing the Irish federation that it no longer needed to repay any of the purported loan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
