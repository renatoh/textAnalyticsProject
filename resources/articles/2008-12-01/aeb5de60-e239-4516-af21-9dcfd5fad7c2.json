But that was 16 months and 56 games ago and, if the Midlanders fancy visiting Liverpool next season, they will have to avoid too many performances like this. The Swansea manager, Roberto Martinez, has seen his side play out eight consecutive draws since Birmingham beat them 3-2 in the Liberty Stadium in November and he knows this was an opportunity missed to exact revenge against a team he thinks are too good for the Championship. Instead he must now try to solve the profligacy of his strikers, who failed to punish 10-man Birmingham. \"There have been too many performances like that,\" said Martinez, who watched his substitutes Jason Scotland and Febian Brandy spurn chances that any Championship striker should be taking. \"You shouldn't take for granted the amount of possession we had and the way we controlled the game. Not too many teams will do that here. I think everyone would agree that the least we deserved was a draw.\" Alex McLeish called Swansea \"the best footballing team\" he has played this season but added: \"I'm grateful for small mercies from what was a poor performance. They outmanoeuvred us in the midfield with the extra man and we never got into our way of style.\" Swansea had the best chance of the erratic and scrappy opening exchanges. Mark Gower curled a shot wide, Jordi Gomez tested Maik Taylor from distance and at the other end James McFadden shot straight at Doures De Vries. The home crowd grew restless as the second half began but individual errors were rife and more attacks were broken up by misplaced passes than good defensive work. Birmingham were reduced to 10 men for the last 22 minutes as David Murphy got a second yellow card for a clumsy tackle. In the closing stages Scotland and Brandy both wasted wonderful opportunities, Scotland twice before Cameron Jerome almost stole the three points on his introduction for Marcus Bent but his right-footed shot from a tight angle was just off target. Moments later he broke with strength down the right channel only to find no one in the box.
