Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, produced an unusually apt and successful soundbite, saying that the great currency changeover would mean that millions of ordinary folk across the continent would have a \"little bit of Europe in their pockets\". Predictions of gloom and chaos abounded, with a strong dose of wishful thinking from the europhobes and sceptics who never believed in this ambitiously integrationist project in the first place. Logistically, nearly everything went surprisingly smoothly on E-Day itself and in the following crucial weeks, when a staggering 7.4 billion euro notes and 38.2 billion coins were issued to more than 300 million consumers. True, there were plenty of gripes from consumers fumbling with unfamiliar small change and baffling mental arithmetic. And the question of whether to scrap the tiny one, two and even five cent coins seems certain to remain a live one. End of year reports have predictably accentuated the positive. But the latest survey by Eurobarometer, the highly-regarded polling organisation, paints a mixed and in some ways worrying picture. Two in three Germans -who live in the eurozone's largest, and now sickliest economy- are not satisfied with the single currency, dubbed the \"teuro\" in a play on the German word for expensive (\"teuer\") because they blame it for a perceived sharp rise in prices. The commission insists, however, that increases \"that could have been linked to the euro changeover\" raised inflation by a maximum of 0.2 per cent. It admits though, that they were more significant in the service sector, covering everything from hotels to household repairs to haircuts. Bills in cafes and restaurants rose 4.3 percent - almost double the general inflation rate. Attitudes to the single currency certainly differ greatly: in Finland and Belgium nearly 80 per cent of people are pleased with the replacement of their markka and francs by the euro. Eurozone-wide, half of those polled were satisfied. The Irish have adapted most easily. The French found it the hardest. Yet \"psychological\" conversion still has a long way to go everywhere: only 42.2% of consumers already calculate in euros but this percentage drops to 12.5% for purchases of big ticket items like houses or cars. Many retailers still use customer-friendly dual price displays - in euros and the old national currency - which the commission says risks becoming counter-productive. It is now recommending that this practice should be phased out completely by the end of June. \"Where necessary,\" David Byrne, the Irish consumer protection commissioner said this week, \"we should make a last effort to make the euro in our heads as real as the ones in our pockets.\" Easier or not for punters, big macroeconomic difficulties lie ahead. Germany's crisis seems likely only to deepen, while Portugal is already facing sharp public spending cuts. Greece is a looming problem. Attempts are to be made in the new year to reform the so-called \"stability and growth pact,\" the eurozone rule book on deficits - which Prodi memorably dubbed the \"stupidity pact\". France has been warned it is in danger of exceeding the permitted deficit level. Questions remain too over whether the ECB's one-size fits all interest rate can work. It is true that the international climate is uncertain, but efforts to modernise EU economies are moving too slowly. And there are political uncertainties too. Sweden's social democratic government is to hold a referendum on adopting the euro next September. Tony Blair's lack of confidence and the looming war in Iraq mean that hopes for one in Britain in 2003 are fading, even though the results of Gordon Brown's \"five economic tests\" are awaited next summer. Denmark, the third EU member still using its national currency, is unlikely to take the plunge again before 2005, having lost a previous referendum in 2000. Back on the plus side, frequent travellers inside the eurozone find the new currency a real boon. Price transparency means you can now compare the cost of a cappuccino or a taxi ride in Brussels and Barcelona. Visiting Denmark, holding the union's rotating presidency, several times in the last few months, has been an unwelcome reminder of the old irritation at having to spend loose change or keep it for the next trip, along with all those other tiny foreign coins and grubby banknotes gathering dust in the ashtray on the mantelpiece at home. Last but not least, living with that little piece of Europe in one's pocket been a pleasure for the growing army of euro coin collectors. These numismatic nerds enjoy their distinctive national images, in striking contrast to the blandness of biliously-coloured banknotes that are identical from Hamburg to Heraklion. Having become the proud owners of an elegantly-designed Eurocollector board in the spring, my children and I managed to find 94 of all 96 coins, now neatly slotted into their spaces. Regular travel to EU events, attended by people from all over the eurozone, has, I confess, made it relatively easy to acquire the 12 national sets. That's cheating, some purists say. In any event, Ireland's Celtic harp, Italy's Marcus Aurelius, France's proud Marianne, and the lovely Greek triremes all create a satisfying sense of European unity and diversity. But there has been one problem. Faraway Finland produced only tiny quantities of one and two euro cent coins but never actually circulated them. As a result they can only be found squirrelled away in specialist shops for a ridiculously large amount of money, in whatever currency you calculate it. This week, pondering those final empty spaces on an otherwise perfect board, and the approaching festive season, I finally cracked and bought them. That really is cheating, I agree. The coins from the Vatican, Monaco and San Marino - rare and prized collectors' items all - await in the New Year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
