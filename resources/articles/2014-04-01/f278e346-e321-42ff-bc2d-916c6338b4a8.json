In this uniquely unpredictable season no team have confounded expectations more than Tony Pulis' side and having secured their own survival with three games to spare, Palace could have a significant say in who wins the title and who goes down. Their next two matches are at home to Manchester City and Liverpool, and then, on the final day of the season, they travel to Craven Cottage for a derby from which Fulham may need a victory to avoid relegation. None of those teams will relish facing a Palace team who seemed certain to be relegated before Pulis took charge in November but who have banished that threat with a flourish, winning five matches in a row. During that run they have damaged Chelsea's title hopes and Everton's Champions League ambitions before keeping West Ham in trouble with a deserved win that was sealed by Mile Jedinak's second-half penalty. With a solid defence and a midfield anchored expertly by Jedinak, Palace also possess flair thanks to Yannick Bolasie and Jason Puncheon and also have a positive momentum that will make them even more formidable opponents for City and Liverpool. \"They are going to be tough games but confidence keeps growing and growing and when you play with confidence, anything can happen,\" said the Palace goalkeeper Juli\u00e1n Speroni, who again contributed amply to his team's cause by making a string of fine saves. Although beating West Ham achieved Palace's objective of ensuring they will play consecutive seasons in the top tier for the first time in the Premier League era, Speroni insists there is no danger of them lowering their intensity for the run-in. \"We have to be professional,\" the Argentinian said. \"We are going to face every single game and try to win it. That is the way we think and that is the way the manager wants us to be.\" Pulis confirmed that view by saying he will make sure the players do not feel that their campaign is complete. \"I would rather have that little bit of pressure because they have been bloody marvellous with it \u2013 five straight wins,\" he said, though, ever eager to play the underdog, he suggested that Fulham are more likely to feel the effect of that than the title-chasers. \"Manchester City and Liverpool are on a different level to us completely but Fulham are in a little bit of trouble so that could be an interesting game,\" he said. The game between Palace and Liverpool will also bring together the two favourites for the manager of the year award and Speroni says that thanks to Pulis' work, Palace will pose problems for Brendan Rodgers' men. \"It's amazing the job he has done,\" Speroni said. \"How he manages to organise the team, the professionalism of how we work on the training ground, he has been fantastic all season. As a newly promoted team, it took us a while to adapt to the Premier League. Then it took us a little while to adjust to the new manager as well. All those changes always take time to assimilate. But you can see the last five games we have played, we have really been learning how the manager wants us to play, how he wants us to perform, and you can see the results.\" Man of match Mile Jedinak (Crystal Palace)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
