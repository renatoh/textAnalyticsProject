One was MC Hammer's trousers; the other was when the world's supermodels confidently proclaimed they'd 'rather go naked than wear fur'. The fur industry, it seemed, was dead in the water. But as autumn-winter 2006 lines filter into the shops, fur is back for the second year in a row. Meanwhile, ex-fur shunner, Cindy Crawford, has signed up to model Blackglama minks. Where did it all go wrong? In fact the fur trade has staged a clever comeback, sponsoring fashion colleges, appealing to a younger argument and even attempting to hitch its wagon to the ethical fashion movement. It began by taking on fake fur, promoted by anti-fur organisations such as Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals; www.peta.org.uk) as 'evolutionary fur', the animal-free alternative. The pro-fur lobby seized on fake fur's whopping environmental price tag - it is predominantly made from nylon, responsible for 50 per cent of the UK's toxic nitrous oxide emissions. Then there's the fact that it's non-biodegradable and that it takes a gallon of oil to make just three fake-fur coats. The pro-fur lobby simultaneously promoted real fur as an ecologically benign, sustainable, biodegradable product. This might have some basis, were animals trapped from the wild. For example, New Zealand has developed a possum-fur industry which proponents argue is legitimate because the country is overrun with possums, which decimate native trees and eat bird eggs. (For the record, Peta vehemently disagrees.) But, in reality, more than 85 per cent of fur used globally comes from fur farms, of which China is the biggest exporter. A recent investigation by Care for the Wild International (www.careforthewild.org), reported in New Scientist, found appalling standards of animal welfare among Beijing's fur farms, including the fact that animals were skinned while fully conscious. Research by Michigan University found the energy needed to produce real fur coats from farm animal skins was in fact 20 times greater than was required for a fake product. Then there's the fact that fur is processed with formaldehyde and chromium, two highly polluting, potentially carcinogenic substances. So if the ecological argument is flawed, so are the attempts to cast the fur trade as a type of fair-trade model. The fur trade claims, for example, that astrakhan, beloved of Dolce e Gabbana, is derived only from still-born lambs, giving desperate farmers in Central Asia a livelihood when soil erosion rules out growing crops. Apart from the fact that, according to animal-welfare agencies, lambs are barbarically ripped from ewes' stomachs, claims that a fashion trend, lasting two seasons at the most, can lift farmers out of poverty have to be treated with suspicion. It's crucial to make fashion ethical, sustainable and accountable, but fur isn't part of the equation. Which is why I'd rather wear MC Hammer's trousers than fur, real or fake. lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
