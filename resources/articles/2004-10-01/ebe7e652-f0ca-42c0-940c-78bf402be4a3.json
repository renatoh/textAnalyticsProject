Ray Emmett Brown actor and lawyer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/oct/17/features.magazine47", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2004/oct/17/features.magazine47", "fields": {"headline": "Introducing...", "bodyText": "When the Manchester police arrested Ray Emmett Brown on suspicion of burglary, he considered giving up acting. 'Despite having an alibi, nothing I was saying could get them to change their minds,' he says. So, after five years of theatre and TV guest-leads playing petty criminals, drug addicts and skater kids (Casualty, Judge John Deed), Emmett Brown trained to be a barrister alongside his first love, acting. 'Then I was doing Prime Suspect and my nephew was saying: \"Why are you always being chased by the police? Why are you always holding guns to people's heads?\", so I decided to become a paralegal.' Now he has his first lead, in BBC3's razor-sharp new drama Outlaws (Fridays 10.30pm), set in a magistrates court. Emmett Brown plays an idealistic trainee criminal lawyer opposite Phil Daniels's (Quadrophenia, The Long Firm) cynical solicitor. 'It's very bizarre; I had to stop saying, \"It'd never happen like that\" during filming, but it's come out brilliantly.' Now, with a one-year-old daughter, he's still caught between the legal and thespian paths: 'I've only just paid back the \u00a38,000 loan I took out to become a barrister. I'll see how things pan out.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
