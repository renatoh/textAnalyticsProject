In Perth to play in the Hopman Cup and prepare for the Australian Open which starts in Melbourne on 19 January, Murray has shown how a disappointing 2014 \u2013 largely owing to the after-effects of back surgery \u2013 might turn out to be a blip. He won both his matches at an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi, against Feliciano L\u00f3pez and Rafael Nadal, and all three in the Hopman Cup, against Beno\u00eet Paire, Jerzy Janowicz and Marinko Matosevic. The entourage Murray used to travel with numbered in the high teens but in Perth Team Murray is down to three and the Australian Open will be the first grand slam championship for a long time in which Dani Vallverdu, his friend from their days at tennis academy in Barcelona, will not be in attendance. Vallverdu, Murray\u2019s hitting partner, and Jez Green, one of his trainers, left the 2013 Wimbledon champion\u2019s employ in November. The parting was said to have been amicable but it appears the reason may have been that not everyone was on the same page and Vallverdu and Green were unhappy at not being consulted before Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo came on board to replace Ivan Lendl as head coach in June last year. Murray told the Independent: \u201cThe most important point in any team is that everyone has the same vision, everyone wants to move forward together. I feel that\u2019s what I have now. Maybe the last four or five months of last year it wasn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s not as much fun travelling when that\u2019s the case. If everyone isn\u2019t right into it, that isn\u2019t how you want to work.\u201d His pace around the court has been improved by a new regime at his winter training camp in Florida under the supervision of Matt Little. It included speed work Murray had neglected for a long time and involved training on the beach. The result has been that instead of feeling sore on resuming competitive tennis, he \u201cwoke up the next day feeling good\u201d. Murray\u2019s use of a sports psychologist represents a considerable shift in attitude, having once said counting to 10 does not help in a Wimbledon semi-final on Centre Court. He has been working for several months with someone he does not wish to identify and believes it has been a benefit. \u201cI think when it comes to psychology it has to be something that the player wants and the player buys into. When it\u2019s someone else\u2019s suggestion in the past I haven\u2019t felt like it\u2019s worked. But just now I think it\u2019s working well.\u201d The tie-up with Mauresmo is going from strength to strength. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working together now for five or six months. We know each other better, have a better understanding of the things we need to work on in my game. It has worked well,\u201d Murray said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
