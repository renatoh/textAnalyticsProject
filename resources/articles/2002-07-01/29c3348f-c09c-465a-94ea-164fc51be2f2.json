Sadly for the rest of the Open championship field, it happened before the world's leading golfer had even struck a blow in his bid to win a third major title of the year, and the Japanese photographer responsible was swiftly ejected from the Muirfield venue for his efforts. Woods, on the trail of an unprecedented grand slam of all four major titles in the same year, was disturbed by the cameraman as he prepared to drive from the first tee. Pulling away from his shot, the usually ice-cool American rounded on the hapless snapper, himself snapping: \"Haven't you guys taken enough freakin' pictures?\" If not quite Roy Keane telling you to stick it up your bollocks, from the saintly Woods it was shocking enough. And when the photographer dared to repeat the act as Woods finally hit his shot - sending the ball slicing deep into the rough to the right of the fairway - an official confiscated his credentials and ordered him from the course. \"The cameraman was out of line,\" said Woods after completing his one-under-par opening round of 70. \"He took the picture at an inappropriate time. It's fine taking a picture, it's their job, but these guys are professionals, they know when to do it. This one had a heavy finger.\" Typically, Woods made an amazing recovery to par the opening hole, going on to notch up three birdies and two bogeys in a round which left him three shots off the lead shared by Swede Carl Pettersson, and compatriots David Toms and Duffy Waldorf, a fellow with a surname that conjures up pictures of Basil Fawlty being fresh out of them. Waldorf is a cheerful extrovert whose shirts suggest he has walked past an exploding paint factory on his way to the course, and whose wife and daughter often write messages on his golf balls. A group of players one shot behind includes Justin Rose, the 21-year-old Englishman who came fourth in the Open at Birkdale four years ago as an amateur and was playing with Woods yesterday, and Sandy Lyle, former winner of the Masters and the Open, but whose best days seemed long behind him. Out early in the second group, Lyle birdied each of the last three holes to finish with 68 and continue his current rage against the dying of the light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
