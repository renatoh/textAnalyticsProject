The Everton man missed the midweek debacle at Old Trafford because of an ankle injury that has been subsequently shrouded in mystery. England sent him home before the 1-0 defeat to Spain, claiming the problem left him unable to play. Not so, claim Everton, who stated on Friday that he would have been fit to figure had England so wished. One suspects this is an issue that may run and run but, as far as yesterday was concerned at least, Johnson, on the day he celebrated his 26th birthday, turned in a performance of undoubted international calibre. His ninth-minute goal was impressive. He latched on to Mikel Arteta's touch forward, after David Dunn had made a mess of clearing a Phil Neville throw-in, to convert from a dozen yards with no nonsense or hesitation. But then so too was his all-round display. Admittedly, an already injury-depleted Blackburn were further affected when Dunn hurt himself in the process of fouling Neville just before the goal. He eventually left the field after a quarter of an hour, forcing manager Mark Hughes to abandon the intriguing 4-2-3-1 formation he had used from kick-off, in which Dunn and Tugay played as the deep-lying midfielders. Rovers' disruption allowed Everton to piece together some undeniably impressive attacking play, particularly in the final 20 minutes of the first period, in which only the imperious Brad Friedel stood between Blackburn and utter annihilation. Everton's on-loan debutant Manuel Fernandes, who was more than decent in a central-midfield role, should have put the game beyond doubt just after the half-hour when he spearheaded a counter-attack with Johnson that saw the centre-forward slip through a perfect pass. Fernandes's first touch deserted him as he bore down on Friedel and the American blocked his shot, with the Everton man placing the rebound into the side netting. That was the best of numerous half-chances and it was the closest Everton came to adding to their lead until six minutes into the second half, when the excellent Arteta tricked his way to the left byline and pulled the ball back across an open goal, only for it to pass inches behind Johnson who was unable to connect. A second goal would have been welcome. As for Blackburn, they managed to create two good openings, either side of the interval, but they were their only real ones of the contest. Tim Howard, a virtual spectator until that point, tipped Zura Khizanishvili's fierce shot from the edge of the area over his crossbar before, a minute after the restart, Paul Gallagher's stinging and unexpected long-range shot was turned around the post by the home goalkeeper. Man of the match: Andrew Johnson Mystery may have surrounded his midweek non-involvement with England, but there was no disguising a \ufb01rst-class performance from the Everton man. Asked to lead the line , he shouldered more than his share of the workload and scored an excellent goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
