I think I pretty much was Alice, and I definitely wore those skinny jeans. The Alice in question is 16 years old and lives in the \u201cshit-hole that is Ealing\u201d. Tomorrow, Alice is going to have sex for the first time and she\u2019s very nervous. You\u2019ll feel nervous too: there\u2019s a moving honesty about Amy Blakelock\u2019s new play. It isn\u2019t particularly radical or new \u2013 despite the plot point involving social media \u2013 but it is written with an open heart and open mind. As Alice breathlessly counts down the minutes to her first sexual encounter, she tells us everything she\u2019s thinking and feeling. Sometimes it\u2019s a little too much, and there\u2019s no doubt this one-woman play \u2013 verging on a diary entry \u2013 could do with a sharp edit. The endless similes (feelings are variously compared to electricity, treacle and cement) can get cloying. But there\u2019s a naivety about Blakelock\u2019s writing and Robyn Wilson\u2019s gently persuasive performance that ultimately works quite well. Here is a young woman IRL: unfiltered, unsure of herself but utterly truthful. Director Hannah de Ville, with the aid of Dan Saggars\u2019 lighting and Anna Clock\u2019s humming sound design, does a good job of suggesting the pervasive influence of social media. Every time Alice receives a text from her crush, the lights flicker and the music swells. When she looks upwards to read her texts, there\u2019s something oddly spiritual in her stance. And when Alice\u2019s private life is made agonisingly public, a large block in her bedroom suddenly lights up. It\u2019s blindingly bright and, as Alice looks down, it threatens to swallow her whole. At the Blue Elephant theatre, London, until 23 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
