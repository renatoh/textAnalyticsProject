Is it the Gallic murmurings of the competent, all-French staff? The combination of excellent meat cooked on a massive grill in the centre of room, with classic brasserie staples? The period premises help, camped up with turquoise banquettes and crystal lamps topped by pink silk shades. Le Mazot, Whatley Manor, Easton Grey (01666 822 888) Even hotel guests at this Cotswolds mansion prefer the informality of its brasserie to the recherche delights of its Michelin-starred dining room. As a nod to the Swiss owners' sense of nostalgia, Le Mazot has the decor of a Swiss chalet and some of chef Martin Burge's dishes are 'evolutions' of Swiss fare, like the twice-baked Roquefort souffle. Others are merely delicious versions of everyone's favourite supper: rib-eye of beef with bearnaise sauce, or cod topped with an egg. Alley Cafe Bar, 1A Cannon Court, Long Row West, Nottingham (0115 955 1013) Feel the vibe ... speakeasies, independent film nights, poetry sessions and percussive party beats are all part of the scene at this relaxed, European-style venue, which might have been born in the Fifties, yet encapsulates modern concerns with healthy living. From the all-day breakfasts to the hemp-seed and chocolate-orange slice, all the food is vegetarian and decidedly yummy. Everyone agrees: the place 'has a lot of soul'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
