Labour has called for an urgent inquiry into why the Department for Education (DfE) lifted a supervision order on the council\u2019s children\u2019s social services in July 2017, when, as a serious case review revealed last week, its frontline safeguarding services were in turmoil. Robert Goodwill, a minister for education at the time, wrote to the Tory-run council in July 2017 congratulating it on \u201cgood progress\u201d in improving child protection after three years in special measures and a further 12 months of Whitehall scrutiny imposed after previous safeguarding failures. Whitehall supervision was now over \u201cwithout cause for concern\u201d, the letter said, before thanking council leaders for \u201call their hard work to get us to this position\u201d. Goodwill added a handwritten message to the bottom of the letter which said: \u201cWell done everybody.\u201d Five months later, in December, two-year old Dylan, who was known to social services, was beaten to death by his drug dealer father. The review published last week found at the time the council\u2019s child protection operations were chaotic and ineffectual, and chances to intervene on behalf of Dylan over the previous two months were missed. The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said the case reviews posed serious questions as to how much the council and the DfE knew about the state of its safeguarding services. \u201cEither the DfE wilfully turned a blind eye or they were too incompetent to know something was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWas the council ignorant of the problems with its children\u2019s services or in such denial it refused to tell the government? Regardless, this led to devastating consequences. There must now be an urgent investigation.\u201d The DfE admitted that at the time the letter was sent it did not have concerns about Northamptonshire\u2019s children\u2019s services and was not aware of the issues that were subsequently raised in the serious case review. A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cEvery single incidence of harm against a child is a tragedy, and these murders in Northamptonshire are truly horrific. It is a sad fact that a death of a child can happen whatever the quality of children\u2019s services but the two case reviews show clearly that there are lessons to be learned which can help prevent such terrible events from happening again.\u201d Northamptonshire council\u2019s leader, Matthew Golby, is facing calls from local Tory MPs and Labour opposition councillors to resign over the child protection failures. Golby was the council\u2019s lead councillor for \u2013 and by law held direct political accountability for \u2013 its children\u2019s services between 2016 and 2018. Golby refused to step down after publication of the case reviews of the death of Dylan and one-year-old Evelyn-Rose Muggleton, who was killed by her mother\u2019s partner in April 2018. Golby said he had \u201cso much to give as leader of the council, not least in my determination to put right the mistakes which were made in these awful cases\u201d. Kettering\u2019s Tory MP, Philip Hollobone, told the Commons this week that Golby, as the local councillor responsible for children\u2019s social services at the time, should resign. \u201cHe is a good man \u2026 but \u2026 I believe, and my constituents believe, that the buck must stop with the person at the top.\u201d Opposition Labour councillors have laid a motion of no confidence in Golby at a full council meeting next week. It has emerged that a number of unnamed social workers have been disciplined following the deaths and have since left the council. Lesley Hagger, the director of children\u2019s services from May 2016 to July 2018, subsequently moved to a senior post at Sandwell council. Councillor Julie Brookfield, Labour\u2019s children\u2019s services spokesperson, said she had raised concerns in 2016 that ministers should not move the council out of special measures because of the failure to solve severe ongoing problems with social worker shortages and systemic safeguarding weaknesses. Her concerns were ignored. She described the relationship between council leaders and the DfE at the time as far too comfortable. \u201cIt was a Conservative government talking to a Conservative council,\u201d she said. Keith Makin, the former chair of the Northamptonshire safeguarding children board, which published the two serious case reviews, said last week he believed children\u2019s services had come out of special measures too soon. He described the supposed improvement of those services afterwards as a mirage. Makin resigned from the board last week. After moving out of special measures in 2016, Northamptonshire launched ambitious plans to move its child protection services to an independent trust. These were boosted in July 2017 after it received a \u00a34m DfE \u201cinnovation\u201d grant, although at the time there were signs that the authority was sliding into financial crisis, in part because its spending on children\u2019s social care was out of control. The trust was a central plank of a so-called Next Generation plan to turn the county\u2019s services into arm\u2019s-length commercial-style mutual companies. The purpose of the trust, according to its outline business case, was to improve services and cut costs while encouraging \u201centrepreneurialism and trading for maximum social benefits\u201d. Planning for the trust may have led to council leaders taking their eye off day-to-day issues, said the children\u2019s social care expert Prof Ray Jones. He said: \u201cSetting up a children\u2019s trust even at the best of times is a managerial distraction and creates additional costs. If a council is already struggling financially and if children\u2019s services have not had a lengthy period of stability it is likely to make services even more vulnerable.\u201d A scathing inspector\u2019s report into the county council\u2019s financial collapse last year noted that its leaders had wasted \u201cscarce resources in terms of people, time and money\u201d pursuing Next Generation. \u201cThere was not then and has never been any hard-edged business plan or justification to support these proposals,\u201d it said. The children\u2019s trust project was put on hold in June 2018, five months after the council effectively went bankrupt. The council feared the \u00a34m would have to be repaid, but the government has imposed a children\u2019s trust model on the county as part of its rescue plan, and the council says the investment will be useful in developing the trust and other initiatives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
