Although it hopes the move will be funded out of the licence fee, the corporation is studying the idea as a fallback option should the government's settlement be less than the BBC has requested. Sport, Radio 5 Live, the new media department and Children's BBC could move to the north-west by the end of the decade. The corporation wants to create a \"media zone\", a cluster of independent producers, technology companies and possibly other broadcasters - including ITV - in an attempt to save money through partnerships. BBC Governors are in the process of appointing consultants to look into the costs. The BBC will then make a decision about funding, depending on the licence fee settlement. Though the preferred option is for the project to be funded by licence payers, a bond is still on the agenda, say insiders. The BBC is already planning to use the instrument in order to pay for the additional costs of digital switchover, targeting help for vulnerable, older and disabled people. Its plea for a generous licence settlement, rising by the retail price index plus 2.3%, did not include paying for additional switchover costs. These are still not precisely costed but are expected to run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Bonds have already been used to finance the BBC's \"media village\" in White City and the redevelopment of Broadcasting House in central London. A BBC spokeswoman said: \"The BBC is not appointing consultants. We are not looking at a bond to finance the Manchester move. It will be funded out of the licence fee.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
