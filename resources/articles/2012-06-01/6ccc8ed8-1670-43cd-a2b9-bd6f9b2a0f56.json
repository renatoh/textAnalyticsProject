When Peter Nowak was awarded the honor of coaching the MLS All-Star team this July, it seemed to place the Philadelphia coach in an enviable position. Murmurs about the off-season turnover of players at the Union had already begun turning into outright dissent in the River End, when the All-Star announcement seemed to confer bulletproof status on his troubled reign, with most observers feeling that there was no way he would be sacked before the All-Star game at PPL Park in late July. On Wednesday, however, another announcement, this one from Union CEO Nick Sakiewicz, revealed that Nowak had left the club and would be replaced, on an interim basis, by his right hand man John Hackworth. For Nowak to find himself joining Aron Winter as the first MLS coaching casualties of the season, during the period of managerial reviews prompted by the international break, says much about how far his stock has fallen since guiding the Union to their first play-off appearance in only their second MLS season in 2011. Ironically the last MLS game for both Nowak and Winter was the clash between their two struggling sides at BMO Field on May 26, where Toronto managed their first points of the season at the tenth attempt - in a result that wasn't enough to save Winter's job and may have been the final straw in Nowak losing his. That said, last weekend's newspaper claim that he had submitted a CV for the vacant Hearts manager's position, hardly helped his relationship with the Philadelphia management team, who had watched with alarm as his relationship with first-teamers and fans alike deteriorated, along with the club's league position. The departure of Faryd Mondragon and S\u00e9bastien Le Toux in the off-season, without comparable replacements arriving, had alarmed die-hard fans. Le Toux's departure in particular, was messy, with coach and player sniping at each other in the media. As the season started and results were visibly underwhelming, the news that Nowak had first fallen out with, and then traded, club captain Danny Califf, before also trading Danny Mwanga, the underperforming starlet who he had pursued and then made first draft choice in 2010, just seemed to isolate him further. Nowak could legitimately point to last season's success and his period at DC United from 2004-2006 as evidence he could build a side, but the sheer turnover of players, and key ones at that, was anathema to building team spirit. A beleaguered Nowak briefly seemed to take a perverse pleasure in demonstrating he was his own man - a jaw-jutting array of seemingly inexplicable selections and substitutions were used to show his authority over the Philadelphia squad and to silence dissent. But the counter-punching swagger of 2011 had given way to the shapelessness one might reasonably expect of the group of strangers that is the current Philadelphia squad, and ultimately Nowak, as the center, could not hold. Winter, equally his own man as Nowak, but with a more circumspect managerial style, paid the price for terrible league results. His three year project to reinvent his Toronto side in a championship-winning, fluid 4-3-3, ran afoul of injuries and a general incompatibility of personnel with the attempted transformation, early in the second year. The league form was abysmal - nine straight losses opened the club's MLS campaign this year. Were it not for the two-legged victory over LA Galaxy that took the club to the Champions League semi-final, Winter probably would have gone sooner. As it was the Voyageurs Cup win over Vancouver and the aforementioned victory over Philadelphia just served to delay the inevitable. The club's technical director, ex-England and Ipswich Town striker Paul Mariner, now takes over as head coach. Mariner though, is as implicated in the mess at Toronto as Winter - he has been directly involved with the acquisition of over half the underachieving squad, though promises to give them more tactical input on finding a shape that works for them, rather than Winter's failed attempt at forcing total football. Continuity remains a problem at Toronto. Mariner is the seventh coach in the sixth year of the team's existence in MLS. With Nowak now out at Philadelphia, their fans will be hoping that the turnover on the pitch is not followed by a similar churning of coaching staff that the fans north of the border have experienced. For both Toronto and Philadelphia fans, the resumption of the MLS schedule this weekend will bring a simple wish for some stability - and hopefully some lessons learned. Reactions to Nowak's departure Nick Sakiewicz, CEO, Philadelphia Union: At some point, you wake up in the morning and you realize this isn't quite the way you want the Union brand represented...I'm not a wine connoisseur, but I know what good wine tastes like. When I sipped the wine recently, it didn't taste so good. Make no mistake, this is not about wins and losses or our performance as a team...We have a very good team. We have very good players. This is more about philosophical differences about the way [owner Jay Sugarman] and I envisioned this club. Sometimes that happens \u2013 the head coach and ownership aren't on the same page. That's why I felt it was really important to make the change and give John the opportunity. (full quotes at mlssoccer.com) Scott Kessler, Managing Editor, The Brotherly Game blog, Philadelphia: I would say that a lot of people in the area and who follow the team saw it coming. As was discussed in the press conference announcing his departure, the Union's front office wanted to protect the brand and to fulfill the team's marketing potential and they were very aware of the fanbase beginning to erode, and the mood of those who were still here, so it was basically a question of when they would step in. The timing was strange though - the team lost to Harrisburg City Islanders (the Union's next Open Cup opponents) in a friendly last night, but generally I think people are wondering why this didn't happen at the start of this international break and before Mwanga was allowed to be traded. If the cup run was keeping his job, the team is still in the cup, and a lot of other people thought being All-Star coach would protect him, so if the \"philosophical\" reasons were enough to get rid of him now, they probably applied equally a couple of weeks ago and that might have been a better time to act. But overall, the decision is understandable. Reactions to Winter's departure Tom Anselmi, Executive VP and COO, Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (owners of Toronto FC): This was a very difficult decision for both of us, but one that I believe is necessary given our team's regular season results... Our fans have been very patient and we gave Aron every opportunity to turn things around, but it came to a point where a change needed to be made. Anyone who has met or spent time with Aron during his tenure with our club will agree that he's as classy a person as you will meet in the world of professional sports. He leaves our club having made an indelible mark. I'm confident in Paul's abilities and skills to lead our team out of our current position and through the rest of the season. The fact that he has been part of our management team will make this transition an easy one for the club, and most importantly our players. (full quotes at torontofc.ca) Boris Aguilar, Executive, Red Patch Boys (Toronto supporters group): It doesn't really come as too much of a surprise, to be honest - after a 0-9 start, what do you expect? It was a shame though, as they'd just won the Voyageurs Cup and the first MLS game, but it was definitely a case of too little, too late. I think that Winter had a system in place but the supporters, management, press and the city didn't have the patience to see it out. He and Mariner spent half the first season evaluating, then had a fire sale and an overhaul before the second. A lot of the new players are really young and they should evolve into the next phase of the team. Mariner is no surprise. He's been there for a while - it's a great move. He has a lot of experience of the league. He doesn't necessarily have a lot of head coaching experience but he gets what Toronto is all about and what it needs. Be interesting to see what formation he plays - rumors I've heard so far are suggesting 4-4-2. Regardless, Mariner is more flexible than Winter when it comes to the system, so it should benefit the team in the short run. Duncan Fletcher, Waking the Red, Toronto: I think for better or worse, the Winter firing had to happen. Admirable long term goals aside, the results just weren't happening with the first team. Given our history and desire for stability, mediocre would have been more than enough to keep the job, but 1-9 was just too bad to let continue. The timing was curious after winning the Voyageurs Cup and finally getting that win, but it seems like it was timed to coincide with Canada games and Euro 2012. As for Mariner, it's an underwhelming choice, if a very obvious one. Right from the time he was announced as part of the management team at the same time as Winter, he's had the appearance of being the succession plan if things go wrong, and now here he is. Sadly his 28 game spell in charge of Plymouth Argyle puts him in 2nd place out of our 7 head coaches so far when it comes to experience. His big selling point is North American experience from his time with New England, which is definitely a good thing - and if he can figure out the compromises and pragmatism needed to make the squad come together and be more than the sum of its parts, that should be enough to improve things considerably. Even making the playoffs is very much out of reach already, so just seeing improvements, getting a few wins and providing some hope for next year, is the very low bar that's been set - and it should be easily achievable. This squad isn't 1-9 bad, just having our best players healthy for an extended time should be enough to make Mariner look good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
