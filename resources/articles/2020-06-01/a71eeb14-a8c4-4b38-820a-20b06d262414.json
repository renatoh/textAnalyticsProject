According to Simon &amp; Schuster, Mary L Trump will describe \u201ca nightmare of traumas, destructive relationships, and a tragic combination of neglect and abuse\u201d that explain the inner workings of \u201cone of the world\u2019s most powerful and dysfunctional families\u201d. In turn, it was reported on Tuesday night that Trump is considering an attempt to stop the book being published, akin to his decision earlier in the day to go to court over former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s imminent tell-all. News of Mary L Trump\u2019s Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man, which is set to be released in July, broke on Sunday evening. Further information, including the title, then appeared on an Amazon page. According to the blurb, \u201ca trained clinical psychologist and Donald\u2019s only niece\u201d will \u201cshine a bright light on the dark history of their family\u201d and offer a \u201crevelatory, authoritative portrait of Donald J Trump and the toxic family that made him\u201d. Mary Trump was reportedly a key source for the New York Times\u2019 Pulitzer prize-winning coverage of the family\u2019s tax affairs. The Amazon blurb says she \u201cspent much of her childhood in her grandparents\u2019 large, imposing house in the heart of Queens, where Donald and his four siblings grew up. \u201cShe describes a nightmare of traumas, destructive relationships, and a tragic combination of neglect and abuse. She explains how specific events and general family patterns created the damaged man who currently occupies the Oval Office, including the strange and harmful relationship between Fred Trump and his two oldest sons, Fred Jr and Donald.\u201d Fred Trump Jr, Mary Trump\u2019s father, left the family business and died in 1981, aged 42, of heart problems arising from alcoholism. Mary Trump has a brother, Fred III. Donald Trump\u2019s surviving siblings are Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge, Elizabeth Trump Grau, a retired banker, and Robert Trump, a businessman. Mary Trump studied English at Tufts and Columbia and clinical psychology at Adelphi University in Long Island, New York. In 2000, she gave a rare interview to the New York Daily News, in which she said her \u201caunt and uncles should be ashamed of themselves\u201d for their behaviour over Fred Trump Sr\u2019s will, and their treatment of her nephew, who has cerebral palsy. According to the Daily Beast, she signed a non-disclosure agreement which said she could not discuss litigation over that will or her relationship with Donald, Robert or Maryanne. Citing an anonymous source, the Beast said the president had mentioned the NDA in the last few days. Mary Trump has expressed opposition to her uncle on Twitter, in a rarely used account which on Tuesday featured a prominent picture of Black Lives Matter Boulevard, a street near the White House which was renamed after Trump ordered an assault on peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church. The president\u2019s niece now plans to offer \u201cunsparing detail [on] everything from her uncle Donald\u2019s place in the family spotlight \u2026 to \u2026 the appalling way Donald, Fred Trump\u2019s favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d. As the blurb says, \u201cpundits, armchair psychologists and journalists have sought to parse Donald J Trump\u2019s lethal flaws\u201d. Previous such titles include Trump on the Couch and The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump. According to Simon &amp; Schuster \u2013 which is also behind Bolton\u2019s tell-all and Bob Woodward\u2019s Trump books \u2013 Mary Trump \u201chas the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick. \u201cShe alone can recount this fascinating, unnerving saga \u2026 because she is the only Trump willing to tell the truth about one of the world\u2019s most powerful and dysfunctional families.\u201d Former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg told the Beast that Mary Trump\u2019s book would worry the president more than that by Bolton, because \u201cit\u2019s about family, it\u2019s a personal betrayal \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen something like this.\u201d Bolton\u2019s book, The Room Where It Happened, is due out on 23 June. On Tuesday, the Trump administration asked a federal judge to block it, arguing Bolton had breached a contract and risked exposing classified information. Most observers suggested the gambit is unlikely to work, given first amendment protections of free speech. In a statement, Simon &amp; Schuster said Trump\u2019s lawsuit was merely aimed at quashing \u201ca book it deems unflattering to the president\u201d. Too Much and Never Enough is set for publication on 28 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
