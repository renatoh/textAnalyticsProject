Part narrative! All vaguely intriguing! This could be the billboard ad for Hong Kong Trilogy: Preschooled Preoccupied Preposterous, though if one were to advertise for this film, you\u2019d likely lead with the visuals and leave words out of the picture. It\u2019s no surprise that Hong Kong Trilogy has a striking look, as it is directed by Christopher Doyle, the Australian-born cinematographer who rose to arthouse fame lensing Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s slick, stylized films Chungking Express, Fallen Angels and In the Mood for Love before working with directors like Jim Jarmusch and Gus Van Sant. While not the first time in the director\u2019s chair (there was a Polish thriller called Warsaw Dark, a chapter in the Paris, Je t\u2019aime anthology and Ai Weiwei\u2019s music video Dumbass, this could be considered his proper auteurist debut. The endeavor, partially funded via Kickstarter, does its best to present the essence of Doyle\u2019s adopted city, and while never boring, the strangeness of its specificity prevents the jigsaw pieces from ever clicking into place. There\u2019s an odd frustration in a movie like this, as flashes of genuine excitement make the filler all the more tiresome. There\u2019s the adage to \u201calways leave them wanting more\u201d, but Doyle\u2019s film takes it way too far. The trilogy of the title represents three sections. Preschooled is shot in an elementary school, tree-lined and quiet despite its urban environment. We observe some of the kids \u2013 like a boy who beatboxes love songs, a pantheistic girl who prays to all of the world\u2019s recognized deities in an effort to save her family and friends, and a quiet boy who likes to hang out with a group of flamingos. (It is unclear just how many Hong Kong schools have their own zoos.) These images are not shot documentary-style. The are carefully framed and edited together using traditional narrative coverage. However, in voiceover, we hear snippets of what sound like lengthy, unrehearsed interviews. Many of these glimpses, particularly of the young girl who lives on a houseboat, are mesmerising. The second section, Preoccupied, is set against 2014\u2019s democracy protests that were dubbed the umbrella revolution. Some aspects of this section are newsy, like looking into the orderly tent city, its mail-delivery system, its pop-up farms and the supportive tweets from around the world projected against a concrete wall named for John Lennon. There\u2019s also a look at the spontaneously generated economy, like an arts space, which then dovetails into a clearly fictionalized bit of comedy concerning a western beer enthusiast and bar owners. The goal, I would imagine, was something of a replay of Haskell Wexler\u2019s Medium Cool, in which a drama ran right into the Chicago protests of 1968. Doyle\u2019s version is far more clumsy and has none of the urgency. Adding in a shot of childlike special effects doesn\u2019t help much either. The third chapter, Preposterous, borders on ageism, as it watches senior citizens engage in various socialising exercises. Sure, speed-dating on a tourist tram as a dolled-up \u201cStreet Diva\u201d sings songs is a humorous tableau, but the tone comes off as smug and nasty. Characters from the first two sections reappear and all end up at the seaside as we hear vague ruminations about the future of Hong Kong. Not a sequence in this movie goes by where there isn\u2019t a composition worthy of a high-res Vimeo screengrab, which is, indeed, intended as a compliment. Doyle has a remarkable eye, of that there is no question. He is also a noted rabble-rouser; self-described as the Keith Richards of cinematography. One would think, then, that his movie would have more entertainment value. There\u2019s little of the poetry one can find in Chris Marker\u2019s essay film Sans Soleil or the weirdness of Werner Herzog\u2019s travelogue Fata Morgana, two titles with which Doyle would no doubt love to be compared. Perhaps for his next trick, he\u2019ll work with a screenwriter and produce something greater than a good-looking curiosity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
