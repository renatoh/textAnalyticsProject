And I will say my job, as I travel the world, I just want to know when I will be loved.\u201d Ronstadt replied: when he stopped \u201cenabling Donald Trump\u201d. The remark was relayed in a viral tweet by Sam Greisman, son of the actor Sally Field, another honoree. \u201cLinda Ronstadt got up to get laurels,\u201d he wrote, \u201clooked the fucker right in the eye and said \u2018maybe when you stop enabling Donald Trump\u2019. Icon.\u201d Variety saw the incident slightly differently, reporting: \u201cRonstadt rose to the microphone a feet away from the host\u2019s table and looked straight ahead. \u2018I\u2019d like to say to Mr Pompeo, who wonders when he\u2019ll be loved, it\u2019s when he stops enabling Donald Trump.\u2019 Then she sat down.\u201d Pompeo, who said \u201cI just read them\u201d after his When Will I Be Loved gag prompted laughter, also said he was \u201ca big fan of Linda Ronstadt \u2026 an icon of folk and country music\u201d whom he saluted for \u201c30 albums, 10 Grammys, a bestselling memoir\u201d. Other lines Pompeo was given to read in his brief tribute to Ronstadt might not have sat well with a senior member of an administration dedicated to building a wall on the southern border and clamping down on immigration in general. \u201cAnd as a nod to her own ancestry,\u201d Pompeo read, \u201cMs Ronstadt released a collection of traditional Mexican songs, which became the bestselling non-English-language album in all of American history. \u201cShe\u2019s shared her musical gifts in uniquely impactful ways, including teaching music and dance to the children in Mexico.\u201d Ronstadt, 73, was born in Tucson, Arizona, and has Mexican, English and German ancestry. Known for her activism in support of a range of progressive causes, she retired from singing in 2011 and now suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease. Trump has never attended the Kennedy Center Honors, a ceremony which takes place on Sunday, despite it being a bipartisan fixture of the Washington scene which presidents \u2013 or in their enforced absence, first ladies \u2013 have headlined since 1978. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which political party we\u2019re from,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cArt belongs to no party, no class, no gender, no age. It belongs to each and every one of us. This event\u2019s really important.\u201d Deborah Rutter, the president of the Kennedy Center, told the Washington Post: \u201cIn a perfect world, we would have the president of the United States in attendance. It\u2019s an important evening for the arts \u2013 not just at the Kennedy Center, but all across America.\u201d This year\u2019s honorees are Ronstadt; Field; Sesame Street; Michael Tilson Thomas, director of the San Francisco Symphony; and the band Earth, Wind and Fire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
