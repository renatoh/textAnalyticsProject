MPs and charities representing road accident victims say that the scheme must be stopped immediately, claiming that it could be causing 27 more teenage deaths or serious injuries a year. Ministers have set themselves a target of reducing road deaths and injuries by 40 per cent by 2010, and the cornerstone of their strategy is cutting the number of accidents among younger motorists. Drivers aged 17 to 21 are twice as likely to be involved in serious accidents as older ones. The Driving Standards Agency, responsible for driving tests, set up a schools driver education programme, in which examiners were sent to talk to almost a million 16- to-18-year-olds. The presentations last 50 minutes and the examiners emphasise why drivers need to take the driving test, but there is no behind-the-wheel training involved. A report in the Lancet medical journal by British public health experts says the scheme simply encourages teenagers to start driving as soon as they are legally old enough, rather than wait till they are older and less accident-prone. It says the lack of practical training does nothing to make them better drivers. Research from the United States, New Zealand and Australia shows that such schemes lead to more deaths, not fewer. The report's author, Ian Roberts, director of the Institute of Child Health at University College London, wrote: 'The programme could easily increase licensing but with little or no impact on driving skills, possibly the worst combination from a road safety perspective.' Dr Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat health spokesman, said the Government must stop encouraging teenagers to drive. 'The Government must look at the evidence, which is that it costs lives and wastes money. 'They have no evidence that it helps people improve their driving rather than just encouraging them to drive younger.' Harris is writing to all the schools in his constituency suggesting that they withdraw from the training scheme. anthony.browne@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
