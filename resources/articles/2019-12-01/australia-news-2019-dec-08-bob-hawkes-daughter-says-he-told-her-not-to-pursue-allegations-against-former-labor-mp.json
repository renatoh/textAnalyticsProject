In claims published by the New Daily, Rosslyn Dillon levelled the allegations against former Labor Victorian MP Bill Landeryou, who died in February, as part of her legal challenge against her father\u2019s $18m estate. In pages of the 25-page affidavit lodged in the New South Wales supreme court published by the New Daily, Dillon alleges she told her father of the assaults at their family home \u2013 and he pleaded with her not to go further with the claims. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to the police. You can\u2019t. I can\u2019t have any controversies right now. I am sorry but I am challenging for the leadership of the Labor party,\u201d Dillion reports in the affidavit, adding she was \u201cshocked and hurt\u201d by her father\u2019s request. \u201cI thought to myself I could not make any bigger sacrifice to [my father\u2019s] political career if I had tried. \u201cHe asked me to let the matter go for him and I did so for him. \u201cI am still haunted by the sexual assaults. I feel that I may have had a chance to get over these rapes if I was able to report the incidents to police.\u201d Labor MP Tanya Plibersek said she could not comment on specific allegations, because of the legal action, but said \u201cin the most general terms \u2026 anybody who has been the victim of a sexual assault, should be encouraged to take the matter to police to have it dealt with properly, to be thoroughly investigated.\u201d Dillon\u2019s sister, Sue Pieters-Hawke, told the New Daily the Hawke family had known of the allegations. \u201cI love and support my sister,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cShe did tell people at the time. I believe there was a supportive response but it didn\u2019t involve using the legal system.\u201d Hawke\u2019s will sets out $750,000 for each of his three children and his stepson, Louis Pratt, with the remainder of the estate left to his wife, Blanche d\u2019Alpuget. Dillon recalls the assaults as happening in 1983, after her father used his influence to secure her employment with Landeryou, who she says was industrial affairs minister at the time. The New Daily reported the timeline outlined in the affidavit did not \u201cadd up \u2013 unless she is confused about what year she worked for Mr Landeryou\u201d. The New Daily reports Dillon confirmed she was struggling with substance abuse issues at the time of the alleged assaults. Hawke first mounted a leadership challenge in July 1982 but was unsuccessful. Bill Hayden resigned as Labor leader in February 1983 with Hawke emerging as the successor. Hawke went on to win the March 1983 election and became one of the Labor party\u2019s most successful prime ministers. Dillion is making a $4m claim against her father\u2019s estate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
