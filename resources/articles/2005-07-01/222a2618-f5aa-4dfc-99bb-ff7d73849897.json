The reality, however, is rather more complex. Increasingly, the right to protest is under threat in the UK. The police have adopted a series of draconian measures that serve to detain demonstrators before any crime has been committed. Instead of protecting the rights of citizens, they are increasingly taking them away on the order of the government. To do so is to incite the kind of trouble we saw in Edinburgh, minor skirmishes that mask a wider political violence being waged on the right to demonstrate. Tom Eyers Cambridge Much credit should be given to the Edinburgh and other police forces involved in managing the demonstrations organised by the anti-capitalist groups in the city. Claims that some police were heavy-handed should cast minds back a few years to Genoa or the May Day riots and consider the alternatives open to the authorities. That neither Dissent nor the Wombles groups (or any other organisation) involved had cooperated with the authorities preceding their protest left police and local government with little choice but to prepare for the worst. From what I could tell, the police acted with considerable restraint facing substantial provocation. You either have a structure in place to deal with the unexpected, or you give direct action groups carte blanche to behave as they will. The latter is not an option, irrespective of how much we may sympathise, to some degree, with their general goals. George Corner Edinburgh The real crime of the demonstrators was to step outside the official space for protest, sanctioned and organised by the police. I experienced this myself at the G8 justice ministers meeting in Sheffield last month, where the police organised a pen for protesters to stand in, and detained and attacked protesters who stepped outside it. This growing idea that protest is only legitimate when it follows arrangements dictated by the authorities is paradoxical, to say the least. Dr Bob Banks Grindleford, Derbys I must pull up Hilary Benn when he says that he expects Gleneagles to send \"a really powerful message\" to the World Trade Organisation talks at Hong Kong in December that the rich states \"helping Africa to trade its way out of poverty is best in the long term\" (Interview, July 5). It is not that there is anything wrong with that statement - but the British policy of trying to force developing countries to sell off their utilities to multinationals is so clearly contradictory. This is a policy to generate profits for British companies, usually at the expense of the poor. Bill Linton London While Tony Blair uses his rhetoric about global warming on the G8 ministers, MPs have the chance to do something practical. The civil aviation bill is having its first day in standing committee, and proposed amendments would begin to make the bill worth the paper it is written on. The draft bill merely allows airports, if they so wish, to levy charges for noise and pollution from aircraft, but makes no mention of climate change emissions. The amendments seek to to ensure that airports are compelled to apply charges and that they include global warming effects, and that actual emissions are publicised. Surely MPs will vote for this small measure to begin to manage the uncontrolled growth of emissions from air traffic.
