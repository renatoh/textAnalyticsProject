Stagecoach will be off the rails in November. The company won\u2019t bid for new UK rail franchises because it thinks the Department for Transport is unfairly trying to load \u201cunquantifiable and unmanageable\u201d pension risks on to operators. The group\u2019s wholly owned operation on the east Midlands line ends in August and its joint venture with Virgin on the west coast mainline expires in November. At that point, Stagecoach\u2019s rail department will comprise a crew of lawyers suing the DfT over three bids that were disqualified in the same row over pension liabilities. Not every customer will mourn, of course, and a few DfT officials may say good riddance after last year\u2019s forced exit on the east coast. For their part, Stagecoach\u2019s shareholders may sleep more soundly. The top-performing UK transport stock of recent years is the bus and coach operator National Express, whose chief executive, Dean Finch, says his board should sack him if he ever proposes getting back into rail franchising. The rest of us, though, should despair \u2013 not directly for Stagecoach\u2019s exit but for what it says about the rotten state of rail franchising in the UK. The transport secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s current approach can be summed up as \u201cwaiting for Williams\u201d. That is Keith Williams, the former British Airways chief executive who is leading a review of rail franchising. He has already described the current set-up as not fit for purpose, which is indisputable, but has offered few clues about how a \u201ccustomer focused railway\u201d should be structured. Until Williams\u2019 report arrives in November, paralysis reigns. Alternatively, on a good day, the DfT manages a fudge. The east Midlands franchise was awarded to Abellio in April, with Grayling declaring the Dutch state-backed firm to have offered the \u201cstrongest\u201d bid. On closer inspection, Abellio made the only bid that remained upright. The other two runners \u2013 Arriva and Stagecoach \u2013 refused to accept the DfT\u2019s view of pension risks and were disqualified. Now comes the competition for the west coast franchise, the most prestigious of the lot since it will include HS2 (assuming prime minister Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t cancel the high-speed line). From an original field of three, Stagecoach is out, obviously. Then there\u2019s FirstGroup, but it suddenly looks less than reliable. Its chairman has just resigned after a 30% shareholder revolt led by a hedge fund that doesn\u2019t like UK rail operations; and FirstGroup\u2019s chief executive himself has belatedly started to fret about \u201cthe current balance of risk and reward\u201d on the railways. The third bidder is a Hong Kong-Chinese consortium, which was previously regarded as the rank outsider on the grounds that the UK would surely want a UK-controlled operator running the trains on its shiny new railway. Franchising, according to the theory, was meant to deliver competitive bidding which, in turn, would produce better services for passengers and savings for the Treasury. Instead, these competitions have become contests in which one unsatisfactory bidder is left standing and limps over the line. The current quarrel over pension risks makes the process even more opaque. One could take the optimistic view that Williams\u2019 white paper will find a way to create order, but it\u2019s probably not the way to bet. Without Brexit, the franchising shambles would already be a higher priority in Westminster, yet the political fog may yet get thicker. The Stagecoach chief executive, Martin Griffiths, left the door open to a return to rail in time but thought a U-turn \u201chighly unlikely\u201d. For the company, escaping the chaos looks the right decision. But the implied message for the poor punters is not encouraging. H2O \u2013 a liquidity problem Mark Carney is right. It\u2019s absurd that investment funds that hold illiquid assets can offer investors instant access to their cash. \u201cThese funds are built on a lie, which is you can have daily liquidity,\u201d says the governor of the Bank of England. Exhibit A would be Neil Woodford\u2019s Equity Income Fund, which was overloaded with unquoted stocks and had to halt redemptions when too many investors headed for the exit. But Carney may also have thinking about asset manager H2O, a less high-profile example involving illiquid bonds. If the rules of redemption terms need to be changed, financial regulators need get on with it. A sudden evaporation of liquidity has a role in most financial crises, and this flaw with illiquid assets has not been hidden from view. Outsiders could fairly ask why nothing has been done already."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
