We don't want Tom to go, but if someone offers a lot of money there's not a great deal we can do. But we need good players to kickstart our season.\" Middlesbrough's Aitor Karanka said: \"It was very good result and performance. When I came in we were three points away from relegation, now we're not far from the play-offs \u2013 but my mentality stays the same.\" Watford 0-1 Reading Nigel Adkins praised Reading's togetherness after their five-game search for a win in all competitions ended with victory at Vicarage Road. \"We've got a lot of players out injured and we've had a couple of disappointing results over Christmas, but the resolve that the players have demonstrated again in the second half has shown the togetherness of everybody. We're really looking forward to the second half of the season.\" The defeat was Beppe Sannino's first since succeeding Gianfranco Zola. \"I'm disappointed for the supporters and for my group. We started playing 45 minutes too late.\" And the rest Blackburn are still two points off the play-off places after Rudy Gestede's header was enough to beat strugglers Doncaster 1-0. \u25a0 Bolton came from behind at home to Nottingham Forest to draw 1-1. \u25a0 Brighton ended Birmingham's unbeaten run with a 1-0 win at the Amex via a David L\u00f3pez strike. \u25a0 Uwe R\u00f6sler's Wigan eased past Bournemouth 3-0 with goals from Marc-Antoine Fortun\u00e9, Jordi G\u00f3mez and an Elliott Ward own goal. \u25a0 Striker Danny Ings continued his scoring form as Burnley won 2-1 at Yeovil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
