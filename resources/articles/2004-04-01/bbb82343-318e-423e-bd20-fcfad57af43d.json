Then the sun shone; the hugely popular Twenty20 Cup did not prove to be the vulgar nonsense that was predicted; Sussex, unfashionable first-time champions, added romance by upsetting the old order. And crowds improved, unnoticed by those who never watch county cricket but seem determined to undermine it. In the pipe-opener here, once Andy Flower's MCC side had batted Sussex out of contention, the entertainment was always likely to come from personal milestones. Would Mushtaq Ahmed reach 1,000 first-class wickets, joining Phil DeFreitas as the world's only current player to attain four figures? When the MCC declaration came at tea he needed two more but he had eased himself into the season with 40 teasing, whirling overs. Would Alex Gidman console himself for a frustrating winter with a careful century? Having been honoured with captaincy of England A in India he broke his hand in net practice before even leading the team on to the field. But there was more frustration for him yesterday; immediately after lunch, on 91, he came half-forward to Mushtaq and was lbw. And so it was James Foster's day instead. As an England wicketkeeper-batsman he has seen himself slip further down the pecking order with the elevation of Geraint Jones to the Test side but yesterday he had the chance to add to his one first-class century, a modest affair for Durham University against Durham. He knew he had plenty of time - Flower was clearly in no mood to emerge into the April chill until his batsmen had put victory way out of Sussex's reach - and he took watchful advantage of a polite, flat wicket to reach a career-best 110. Adam Harrison, the Glamorgan seamer making his first-class debut, also enjoyed himself in an undefeated ninth-wicket stand of 90, and MCC declared with a vast first-innings lead of 339. When Sussex set out on the survival trail Ian Ward missed a second chance to impress his new employers and those with most to play for today are the MCC bowler-batsmen who are on England's check list - Gidman, Graham Napier and James Tredwell - and maybe Sussex's Matt Prior, yet another batting wicketkeeper to add to the mix."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
