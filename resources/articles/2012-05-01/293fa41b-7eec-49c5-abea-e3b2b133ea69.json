The route is short and suitable for buggies, while the whole area abounds with history and wildlife and is great for picnicking. This is a linear walk, so you should retrace your steps at the end to get back where you started. Why it's special Ashridge is bursting with history \u2013 the house (which is now privately owned) was once home to Henry VIII's daughter Princess Elizabeth, who lived there for eight years until her arrest by half sister Queen Mary in 1554. Its gardens were later landscaped by Capability Brown, and the estate was used as a barracks for troops during both world wars. As such, it's ideal for curious children. The Discovery Room at the visitor centre will answer many of their questions. Keep your eyes peeled for Fallow and muntjac deer roam the estate, and are fairly easy to spot. If it's open, climb up the Bridgewater monument, near the beginning of the walk. This was erected in 1832 to commemorate the great canal builder, the third Duke of Bridgewater. There are stupendous views from the top. There's also the Pitstone windmill, one of the oldest in the country, which ground flour for the village for almost 300 years. The whole mill is ingeniously balanced on a single post, and is open to visitors during the summer months. Recover afterwards The Brownlow cafe, near the monument, is probably your best bet. Here you'll find a good selection of light snacks, from soups and sandwiches and baked potatoes, to tea and scones. There's also a daily specials board. Otherwise, there's the nearby Bridgewater Arms , with its large menu and excellent choice of real ales. If it's tipping down For an expensive treat, you could visit the Snow Centre \u2013 an indoor skiing venue 25 minutes down the road in Hemel Hempstead. Also in Hemel Hempstead is the aptly named Leisure World , a large indoor entertainment complex with cinemas, ice-skating, swimming and water slides. How to get there Tring railway station is just under 2 miles away. You can also get regular buses to Tring, or to Monument Drive, Aldbury, which is just half a mile's uphill walk away from Ashridge. Step by step 1 Start at the visitor centre, near the Bridgewater monument. Cross the green, taking the path leading off the main track (it has stud posts at the entrance). 2 Follow the path into the woodland. Go over the bridge that crosses an ancient drover's path and continue to Moneybury Hill. 3 Continue past the Shooting Lodge (on the left). You will eventually see amazing views of Pitstone Hill and Aldbury Nowers on the left. 4 At a bench near some coppice hazel you will see a spectacular view of Aldbury village. 5 Either turn around and retrace your steps, or continue on in the direction of Ivinghoe Beacon (2 miles)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
