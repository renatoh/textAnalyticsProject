Is it: a) half; b) one quarter; c) three quarters; or d) two thirds? Stumped? Try this one. How many children are estimated to be working in the United Kingdom? Is it: a) 8 million; b) 5 million; c) 1 million; or d) 2 million. I challenge Gordon Brown, Jacqui Smith or Liam Byrne to answer correctly (without prior briefing) either question - or the many others on which prospective British citizens are tested. Journalists who attend the prime minister's televised monthly press conference should spring questions from the \"Life in the UK test\" on him. No doubt, the self-styled definer of all things British could not pass his own Britishness test. I'd be astonished if many people whose ancestry here stretches back to 1066 - or even to Cheddar Man - could answer such questions correctly. And why on earth should a British citizen be required to know? The Britishness test is part of a much broader package that the government, in its mad rush to appease the moral panic about immigration stirred up by the likes of the Daily Mail, is implementing to define and defend Britishness from the onslaught of dastardly foreigners who actually want - how dare they! - to contribute to this country and feel that they belong. While the government's decision to allow the Poles and other new EU citizens to come work here freely was brave and right - and is an important reason why Gordon Brown can boast to have overseen Britain's longest-ever economic boom - it has since produced one idiotic, knee-jerk, xenophobic immigration-policy initiative after another. Take the proposed ID cards for foreigners. They are not just discriminatory, but absurd: if someone claims to be British, and therefore does not (yet) require ID, how on earth is a relevant official meant to determine whether they need to show some? Then, there is the government's pride and joy: the new skills-based points system, which is being phased in from the end of this month. This involves officials from the department deemed \"not fit for purpose\" by Jacqui Smith's predecessor trying to divine how foreigners will contribute to Britain in future and slams the door on low-skilled migrants from developing countries: the equivalent of a new 11-plus exam for vetting immigrants. There goes Britain's chance of admitting the father of a future Barack Obama. Surely a Labour government that purports to believe in opportunity for all should realise that you can't - and shouldn't - determine people's life chances based on their background. And now we have \"earned citizenship\" - another misguided aptitude test. That the proposals were leaked to the Neanderthal Daily Telegraph tells you everything you need to know about the government's intentions. Since only a green paper has been published, the details of the proposals will doubtless change considerably. But the government's thinking is clear. \"Citizenship is not an abstract concept, or just access to a passport. I believe it is - and must be seen as - founded on shared values that define the character of our country,\" Gordon Brown said today. \"I stand for a British way of life where we, the people, are protected from crime, but in return we obey the law, and where we, the people, expect and receive services, but in return pay our fair share in taxes and have the obligation and gain the skills for work where we can.\" Now that may superficially seem fine - even banal; after all, who favours a way of life where people are not protected from crime, don't obey the law, don't work, don't pay their fair share of taxes and don't receive public services in return? But think again: what exactly are the \"shared values\" that, Brown claims, distinguish British people from others? This is not an abstract debate: the government seeks to prescribe these values. \"In the future, the aspiring citizen should know and subscribe to a clear statement of British values,\" Brown said. But if immigrants are to conform to British values, should they model themselves on Jade Goody or Trevor MacDonald, Melanie Phillips or Boy George, Margaret Thatcher or George Monbiot? Britain is inescapably - and wonderfully - diverse, not just thanks to recent immigration, but because human beings are all different, and because people are freer to express their differences since the liberating 1960s. This is something to celebrate, not stifle. Moreover, irrespective of immigration, in our globalising world of foreign holidays, Facebook and fusion food, the bonds of nationality are inexorably loosening. Is that so terrible? Increasingly, we all have multiple, overlapping and increasing self-defined identities: a British citizen may also identify as a European, a Christian, of Irish origin, a Londoner, a student, a trainee doctor, a woman, a mother, a wife, a supporter of gay rights, an environmentalist and, above all, an individual. And if society is broad enough to include nuns and transsexuals, Marxists and libertarians, radical environmentalists and oil executives, surely it can embrace immigrants, too? After all, we don't all need to be alike in order to live together. We just need to respect the basic principles on which our societies are based, such as freedom within the law, equality before the law and tolerance of differences. Contrary to what Brown might think, these are not \"British values\": they are liberal ones. They are shared by many non-Britons, and rejected by some Britons, Islamist bigots, for instance, as well as the BNP. And while people cannot be forced to believe in them, they can be required to respect the law: even those who believe that women are not equal to men must treat them as such. Now, if integration means anything - and often, when ministers use the word, they appear to have no clear idea what they mean by it - it is a two-way street. If people are expected to fit in, they have to be treated equally and made to feel welcome. Liam Byrne's stated mantra is: \"Treat everyone the same: just make sure no one's dodging their dues.\" But treat migrants the same is precisely what the new earned-citizenship proposals do not do. Byrne recently said that newcomers should \"speak the language, obey the law and pay their taxes like the rest of us\". Certainly, it makes sense for immigrants to learn English, but why the need to require it? It is astonishing that the birthplace of the world's language of choice should display such linguistic insecurity. And the implication that migrants - whatever their citizenship status - don't tend to obey the law or pay their taxes is pure malice. Ministers speak as if aspiring British citizens are potential benefit-cheats and criminals, rather then overwhelmingly decent, hard-working and law-abiding people who already make - and want to continue to make - a big contribution to British society. That is xenophobic prejudice - and hardly conducive to fostering the sense of Britishness that the government claims to aspire to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
