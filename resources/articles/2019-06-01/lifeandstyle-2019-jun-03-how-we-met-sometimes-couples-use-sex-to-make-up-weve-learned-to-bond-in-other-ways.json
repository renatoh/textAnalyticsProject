We\u2019ve learned to bond in other ways\u2019", "bodyText": "\u201cI saw him in a room of 500 people and fancied him straight away,\u201d says Zahraa, who met David in 2014 at a Model UN conference, an educational event for students. \u201cI was in black tie and she was in a ball gown,\u201d says David. \u201cNo, this is a disagreement we always have,\u201d laughs Zahraa. \u201cI hadn\u2019t had time to get changed so I was wearing this boring shirt dress.\u201d Whatever she was wearing, David enjoyed spending time with her. Still, they didn\u2019t make plans to meet again. \u201cI was in my first year of university at Exeter and he was studying in the Netherlands, where he\u2019s from,\u201d Zahraa says, \u201cbut we became friends on Facebook.\u201d When David announced that he would be coming to London in 2017, Zahraa jumped at the chance to see him. \u201cI sort of engineered it,\u201d she says. \u201cI told him I\u2019d be in London even though I was living in Exeter.\u201d The pair met up at an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, where Zahraa was determined to impress him with her cultural trivia. \u201cWe had intense discussions about the paintings, but we also caught up because we hadn\u2019t seen each other in so long,\u201d says David. He had no idea Zahraa thought of it as a date. \u201cBecause we lived apart I didn\u2019t really think of it like that.\u201d After a couple more meetings, David\u2019s reservations about the distance began to fade. \u201cShe was so charming, smart and interesting, I thought, \u2018I really want to give the long-distance thing a go.\u2019\u201d They began to chat more often online. When Zahraa went to visit her cousin in Amsterdam, she and David met up and explored the city together. \u201cOne night he took me out to this club and we stayed out until 5am.\u201d That year, he moved to London to study and the pair decided to move in together. \u201cI love that he has such great general knowledge and we can talk about everything,\u201d Zahraa says. \u201cWe communicate in the same way and it makes problems easier to solve.\u201d David says he loves Zahraa\u2019s intelligence and open-minded attitude. \u201cShe\u2019s always willing to see other points of view and gets on with everyone.\u201d From art to electronic music, the couple share lots of interests. But Zahraa is more religious than her partner. Although her extended family are Catholic, her parents converted to Islam before she was born and she was brought up a Muslim. \u201cI consider myself a Sufi of the Mevlevi order,\u201d she explains. \u201cI don\u2019t wear traditional Islamic dress, but I do keep up with my prayers and beliefs.\u201d The couple lived together while David was in London, but Zahraa was clear that she didn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. \u201cI was a bit shocked at first,\u201d says David, who considers himself spiritual, but not religious. \u201cBut I realised that I really valued the non-physical aspects of our relationship and the interests we shared. For me it\u2019s not such a big deal.\u201d Zahraa says others have judged them for their living arrangements. \u201cOther Muslims think it\u2019s wrong because we\u2019ve lived together, and people from a western background just find it odd.\u201d She says it takes \u201ca lot of soul-searching\u201d but it works for them. \u201cSometimes couples use sex as a way to make up. We\u2019ve learned to bond in other ways. We communicate more.\u201d David says that while Zahraa\u2019s faith can lead to the occasional disagreement, they have a huge amount of respect for each other\u2019s beliefs and \u201calways find a way to compromise\u201d. The couple do want to marry at some point, but have no plans to rush down the aisle. Since they lived together in London, David has spent six months in San Francisco and now has a job in the Netherlands, while Zahraa works in London. \u201cIt\u2019s not about age, but maturity,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to be settled in our careers and be financially secure.\u201d Though they are currently based in different countries, they hope to live in London together eventually. \u201cWe need to know what\u2019s happening with Brexit,\u201d says Zahraa. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s hard to plan more than six months ahead.\u201d Want to share your story?
