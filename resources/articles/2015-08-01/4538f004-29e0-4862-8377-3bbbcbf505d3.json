The club had been keen to bring in the midfielder after his release by QPR at the end of last season. A medical was expected to take place on Tuesday but West Ham have ended negotiations after protests from their supporters. Slaven Bilic\u2019s side won 2-0 at Arsenal on Sunday, with particularly impressive performances from Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9, Mark Noble and Reece Oxford at the base of midfield. The emergence of the 16-year-old Oxford, combined with Barton\u2019s controversial history, left many fans questioning why the club were pursuing the move. \u201cI\u2019d just like to thank the West Ham fans who sent me a lot of kind messages on social media,\u201d said Barton in a video posted online on Tuesday night. \u201cObviously with a character like myself, there\u2019s always one or two who are not so kind or complimentary. That\u2019s part of the course with me these days. \u201cWest Ham certainly would have been a good fit for me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed playing at the Boleyn Ground, with a very knowledgable crowd. It\u2019s a place, despite people having reservations, that I thought I could do well and offer something to the squad. \u201cBut for this moment in time, it\u2019s not meant to be. I\u2019d like to wish the football club good luck going forward. No hard feelings.\u201d Barton has also been linked with Aston Villa and revealed his desire to return to the Premier League during their 1-0 win at Bournemouth on Saturday, where he was working as a pundit for the BBC. \u201cJudging by this game it won\u2019t be long before I get a phone call from somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best player might be sitting in the stands this afternoon, even if I do say so myself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
