Inside the 21 June edition of Guardian Weekly", "bodyText": "In the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world\u2019s most strategic waterways where oil tankers pass by like cars on a motorway, even a hint of obstruction can cause global jitters. So last week\u2019s attacks on two oil tankers set nerves on edge as Iran, withering under ever-tightening sanctions, continued to stare down a United States determined to get its way over renegotiating the 2015 nuclear deal. Our big story this week assesses the likelihood of another major conflict in the Gulf where, as Julian Borger reports, Donald Trump may be realising his traditional negotiating strategy is futile in the face of regional diplomatic complexities.
