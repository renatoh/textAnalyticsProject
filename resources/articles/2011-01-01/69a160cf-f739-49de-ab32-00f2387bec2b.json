Elsewhere in culture, from pop to fashion, the National Youth Jazz Orchestra's contemporaries are welcomed just for being young. But the musicians of NYJO make work that takes time. And the orchestra's traditions can seem remote, too. Its sound is rooted in big-band styles that were receding when NYJO was founded in 1965. The reconstituted, revitalised NYJO still plays swinging jazz, but it has expanded its ambitions by commissioning five new jazz compositions with the aid of the PRS Foundation. This also puts them on the spot: for this first night, the ensemble didn't quite settle into the conventional shouters, nor did it sound entirely comfortable with the challenges set by the guest composers. Fort Worth, by Julian Arguelles (who quit NYJO as a teenager), was announced as being \"avant garde\" because it referenced the \"time no changes\" jazz of the 1960s and 1950s freeform. Michael Gibbs's In the Scheme of Things was the most adventurous (and difficult to play), evolving from a call-and-response opening to a riffy close. Jason Yarde's Sub Hub Hubbub, with its spiky theme and soulful backgrounds, was another test for NYJO. Hush by Nikki Iles had a glassy calm, blending wordless vocals with beautifully voiced ensemble. The fifth commission was Tim Garland's accomplished and moving Dawn Before Dark Before Dawn, a tribute to former NYJO drummer (and Ronnie's regular) Chris Dagley, who died aged 39 in a road accident last year. Given time, NYJO can make these pieces work even better. There's huge potential for these young players to make music they can call their own \u2013 and that's what jazz composition is all about."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
