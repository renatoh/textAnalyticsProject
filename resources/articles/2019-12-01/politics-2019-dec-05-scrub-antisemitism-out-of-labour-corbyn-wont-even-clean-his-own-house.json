Corbyn won't even clean his own house", "bodyText": "Just two hours before Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s ITV interview with Julie Etchingham aired, it emerged Boris Johnson wouldn\u2019t be doing his version of it after all. But of course. After this election, will any politician risk doing the right thing as far as scrutiny is concerned? Another short-term win for Johnson, where we all end up the losers in the end. \u201cJust who is Jeremy Corbyn?\u201d wondered the ITV programme\u2019s opening question. \u201cHe\u2019s just the sort of guy who likes to hang out on his allotment,\u201d said the first commentator, \u201cwatch a film and talk about football.\u201d Is he? When GQ asked him for his favourite film two years ago, Corbyn sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not a great cinema attender.\u201d Last film he saw? \u201cI haven\u2019t been to the cinema in ages.\u201d Fair to say he wasn\u2019t a film fan? wondered the mag. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t mind the cinema \u2026\u201d Was Corbyn really Britain\u2019s friend? wondered Etchingham. The Skripal poisonings, blaming terrorism on our foreign policy \u2013 whose side was he on? \u201cI\u2019m on the side of people,\u201d clarified Corbyn with beneficent vagueness. \u201cI\u2019m on the side of our society.\u201d Etchingham mostly wanted to take a personal look at Corbyn, particularly domestic Corbyn. And fortunately, ladies, we no longer think that the personal is political, because Jeremy Corbyn doesn\u2019t do a lot round the house. Or as Laura Alvarez, his third and current wife has put it, he is \u201cnot very good at housework\u201d. \u201cI am good at putting the garbage out,\u201d Corbyn countered. He also claimed wryly to be \u201chead manager of the whole composting arrangements\u201d, which is certainly better than twinkling: \u201cLook, the household is her domain, my life wouldn\u2019t be worth living if I got involved in all that\u201d, but arguably means something similar in practical terms. Then again, tribalism dictates that Corbyn\u2019s focus on bin duties will be regarded as charming by many of the exact same people who lost their shit at the last election when Theresa May suggested to the One Show that there were \u201cgirl jobs and boy jobs\u201d, and that one of the boy jobs was doing the bins. Back then, many people greeted this non-drama with mild observations such as \u201cI truly despair\u201d and \u201csexism at its finest\u201d. Guys, you don\u2019t have to do anything other than detest her. But if the girl in question has made it to prime minister, it\u2019s probably OK to say this stuff within her own marriage? As for Corbyn, perhaps he is like many gentleman dishwasher stackers or countertop wipers we have known. (But of course, not all.) Which is to say, he brings the same level of deliberate incompetence to doing the household dusting as he does to investigating Labour antisemitism \u2013 perhaps hoping that if he does both those jobs sufficiently poorly he won\u2019t be asked to do them ever again. Alas, whilst a welter of women\u2019s lived experience suggests this approach is truly effective as a housework evader, it has had mixed success as far as cleaning house in the Labour party is concerned. Maybe the best way of getting that job done properly is for Alvarez to take over the whole antisemitism caseload with the words: \u201cOh for God\u2019s SAKE, just LEAVE it, then \u2013 it\u2019s quicker to do it myself\u201d? Something for the Labour party to bear in mind when the Equality and Human Rights Commission concludes its investigation, particularly after the Jewish Labour Movement\u2019s eyewatering submission to that body leaked on Thursday. Now, before I move on to the Queen\u2019s Christmas speech section, this is the bit where we have to say that the Tories are worse, even if we\u2019ve said it in multiple other articles, multiple times, including this week. So here we go: Boris Johnson is probably even more useless round the house than Corbyn. Yes! Could Johnson rise to the level of Head Manager of the Whole Composting Arrangements? I sincerely doubt it. Keen to counteract the powerful impression that he does the bare minimum, one of Johnson\u2019s early campaign videos saw him claim to have recently cooked \u201csteak and oven chips\u201d. I can imagine. Johnson\u2019s got the definite look of one of those guys who mastermind a barbecue by letting the women have the endless faff of doing the shopping and the salads and the marinades and the sauces and so on, then stand by the grill with a beer and a pair of tongs, occasionally turning over the chicken drumsticks, taking the credit for \u201cdoing\u201d the whole barbecue. (But of course: not all barbecuers.) And so to Corbyn\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech fibbing. As someone who wouldn\u2019t dream of doing anything so naff as watching it either, I support Corbyn having better things to do \u2013 though perhaps I am not the target demographic for interviews such as this. There is some suggestion that voters will find Corbyn\u2019s viewing habits weird, as though sitting down en famille to watch the Queen not mention Paedophile Island is the behaviour of a normal nation living its best life. Whichever way you shake it, though, it is best not to try to bullshit that you DO watch the Queen\u2019s speech, as the Labour leader did during this interview, saying he has it on \u201cin the morning\u201d. Even worse is sending out Angela Rayner to do clean-up, with the shadow education secretary saying that maybe he watched it in the morning \u201con catch-up\u201d. Is this in his Tardis? As for Corbyn\u2019s refusal to take up the prime ministerial country residence of Chequers on principle should he win next week, this is the diametric opposite to Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to use Camp David and preferring to use his Floridian golf hotel, Mar-a-Lago. As this and all his other interviews ever would attest, Corbyn is not he sort of guy to own a Floridian golf hotel. I hear there is a small structure on his allotment, but certainly nothing with a repro Louis Quatorze ballroom. Apart from anything else, who\u2019d clean it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
