Kyle Kashuv, who became a pro-gun conservative activist after the mass shooting in March last year, tweeted on Monday that Harvard \u201chas decided to rescind my admission over texts and comments\u201d made before the massacre. Kashuv\u2019s comments were made while using a Google Doc with schoolmates in December 2017. A video of his edits to the Google Doc, and those of other school students, were recorded in a video and posted online by a former classmate earlier this year. The video showed Kashuv using comments he later described as \u201cabhorrent racial slurs\u201d in his correspondence with Harvard. \u201cA few weeks ago, I was made aware of egregious and callous comments classmates and I made privately years ago - when I was 16 years old, months before the shooting \u2013 in an attempt to be as extreme and shocking as possible,\u201d Kashuv tweeted on Monday. \u201cI immediately apologized,\u201d Kashuv wrote, claiming that \u201cformer peers &amp; political opponents\u201d had then pressured Harvard to rescind its offer. Kashuv posted a letter to Twitter, dated 24 May, from Harvard that demanded an explanation from him within 72 hours, and said it \u201creserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission\u201d. Kashuv posted correspondence between himself and the college, which resulted in a letter from Harvard, dated 3 June, revoking an offer of a place to study there. \u201cAs you know, the [Admissions] Committee takes seriously the qualities of maturity and moral character,\u201d the letter from William R Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions, reads. \u201cAfter careful consideration the Committee voted to rescind your admission to Harvard College.\u201d Asked for comment, Harvard said \u201cwe do not comment publicly on the admissions status of individual applicants\u201d. In its coverage of the comments in the Google Doc, the New Yorker described the initial edits as \u201cattempts at humor\u201d, but said \u201cKashuv\u2019s contributions were more unhinged\u201d. \u201cHe referred, in capital letters, to \u2018my jewish slaves\u2019. Elsewhere, he wrote the N-word eleven times in a row,\u201d the New Yorker reported. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m really good at typing\u201d the word, he explained. \u2018Practice uhhhhhh makes perfect.\u2019\u201d After the video was posted on Twitter, Kashuv stood down as high school outreach director with Turning Point USA, a group that promotes conservative ideas on school and college campuses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
