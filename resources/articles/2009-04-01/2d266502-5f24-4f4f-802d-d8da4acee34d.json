Quite apart from persuading Mike Ashley to dispense with the services of Dennis Wise, Shearer's insistence that club employees should be smartly suited and booted has, somewhat startlingly, rubbed off on Newcastle United's owner. Yet, if getting Ashley to swap his once trademark replica tops and open-necked shirts for a collar and club tie proved surprisingly easy, avoiding relegation is infinitely trickier. Three games and a solitary point into the \"Wor Al\" managerial era, Newcastle are second bottom of the Premier League with five matches left. Clearly their plight is not Shearer's fault \u2013 it took Kevin Keegan nine attempts to secure a victory after succeeding Sam Allardyce last season \u2013 but the clock ticks ever louder as he strives to correct a litany of predecessors' errors. A change of manager can often, at least temporarily, inspire previously under-achieving teams towards a few vital wins as players respond to a \"fresh voice\". Sadly Newcastle's decline is too deep-seated to be arrested by such means. This, after all, is a side which has won one of its past 17 games, kept a clean sheet once in the past 18 league fixtures and palpably lacks midfield pace and creativity. Shearer's attempts to plug defensive leaks by switching to a back three have, so far, backfired but with injury sidelining Jose Enrique, the squad's sole specialist left-back, that undeniable gamble probably represented his best tactical option. Desperate times demand desperate measures and Shearer's risk-taking is, by necessity, not merely confined to formations. It also involves the manager, left, asking key individuals to forget their injuries and either perform in severe discomfort or accept controversial pain-killing injections. Once Obafemi Martins and Mark Viduka finally swapped the substitutes' bench for places alongside Michael Owen in a front three during Sunday's defeat at Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle looked newly menacing. When deployed by Keegan last spring that formidable attacking trio swiftly assuaged relegation fears but Shearer is uncomfortably aware that, while Viduka nurses a debilitating achilles tendon problem, specialists have suggested that Martins requires either imminent groin surgery or a lengthy rest. Without that pair to play off, Owen invariably looks a shadow of his former self. As Shearer's goals swept Blackburn Rovers to the title in 1995, team-mates sometimes complained of \"playing through the pain barrier\" when the star centre-forward demanded their on-field presence. In exchange they received Premier League winners' medals but, 14 years later on Tyneside, the incentives for responding to Shearer's managerial rallying cry may seem rather less compelling. Even if the former Newcastle captain wins his battle for hearts and minds, doubts remain as to whether certain players \u2013 step forward Fabricio Coloccini, Kevin Nolan, Ryan Taylor, Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez and Alan Smith \u2013 are good enough to secure the home victories against Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and Fulham that Shearer regards as imperative. While a small cadre, most notably including Habib Beye and S\u00e9bastien Bassong, have impressed consistently, too many of their colleagues under-perform on an almost weekly basis. Shearer \u2013 whose side must also visit Liverpool and Aston Villa \u2013 has indicated that lack of fitness is a root cause of many recent failings. Diagnosis is, however, frequently simpler than cure and he fully appreciates that pushing already tired players too hard at this stage of the season might result in even more unwanted injuries. His choice of Iain Dowie as assistant manager raised a few eyebrows but the former Crystal Palace and Charlton manager is, unlike Shearer, no technical area novice. Moreover, quite apart from being au fait with the latest innovations in sports science and psychology, he knows about dallying with disaster before ultimately averting catastrophe on Tyneside. When Dowie once brought Charlton north for a game at St James' Park he limbered his players up with a morning jog. Within minutes he had unwittingly led them on to a busy, potentially deadly, high-speed dual carriageway from where the police helped choreograph their rescue by a fleet of taxis. If only escaping relegation were similarly straightforward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
