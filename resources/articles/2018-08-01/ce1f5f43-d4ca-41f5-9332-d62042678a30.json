Martial left United\u2019s tour before the game against Milan last Wednesday to attend the birth of a son, Swan Anthony, in Paris. After United\u2019s final tour game, the 2-1 win over Real Madrid in Miami on Wednesday, the manager said he did not know when the Frenchman would be back. Yet later the same day Martial tweeted: \u201cMy little Swan is fine, for the mum it was harder but thanks to God she\u2019s better now. Sorry but my family will always come first \u2026 Back tomorrow in Manchester.\u201d Martial wants to leave United because of a lack of game-time, with the manager reluctantly minded to allow him to go, and faces a fine of up to \u00a3180,000 for his failure to return to training earlier under the supervision of Mourinho\u2019s staff. The manager pointedly praised the majority of his squad\u2019s attitude at the end of a tempestuous five-game tour. Goals from the lively Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Ander Herrera gave United victory against Mourinho\u2019s former club Real. \u201cWith the fantastic spirit we have in the majority of the players \u2013 I repeat, in the majority of the players, we have a fantastic spirit \u2013 we go with everything we have for the start of the Premier League,\u201d said Mourinho, who revealed that the Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku has cut short his holiday by three days to return to training. United play Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Sunday in their final warm-up game before beginning the Premier League season with a Friday night home game against Leicester on 10 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
