Thousands of elderly people are still unable to have face-to-face contact with relatives despite guidance from health secretary Matt Hancock last week encouraging operators to allow visitors. Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, said: \u201cIn some areas directors of public health have said they will not allow visiting, so a care home might want to reinstate visiting but the local public health director is saying it can\u2019t. \u201cIt is a postcode lottery. And the problem is that there is no accountability trail for directors of public health. Care homes cannot use the government\u2019s guidance to override the local official. This is really a mistake by government.\u201d When the country opened up after the first lockdown, many care homes struggled to allow visits; some have not allowed them at all since March. As the virus began to spread again, those care homes that had opened their doors started to close them. More than 228,000 care home residents in areas under tier 2 and 3 restrictions \u2013 50% of all residents \u2013 were being denied visits, according to research by CSI Market Intelligence, a social care research firm. Then, hours before the second national lockdown began last Thursday, Hancock announced a U-turn, saying visiting was important for care residents, and laying out how it might be handled. This includes creating \u201cpods\u201d \u2013 separate visiting rooms, which should have clear screens between visitors and their loved ones. But the guidance did not make allowing visits obligatory, and care home providers have to carry out a risk assessment taking into account the views of the local director of public health. The guidance also stopped short of creating \u201ckey visitor\u201d status, which would allow at least one relative to have regular testing, protective equipment and training to make longer and more meaningful visits. Last week a coalition of 60 care organisations called for each resident to have a key visitor. The Department for Health and Social Care said a pilot study would begin later this month. Deaths from dementia have risen by 50% in the past six months, according to ONS figures, an increase many relatives believe is related to a lack of contact with familiar people. \u201cWhat we needed was urgent action to safely reconnect residents with their vital support networks, by granting family carers key worker status,\u201d said Helen Wildbore of the Relatives and Residents Association. \u201cWhat we got is guidance encouraging prison-like visits behind screens, which is completely impractical for many older people, who find this too distressing and demonstrating a fundamental lack of understanding about the crucial role family and friends play in residents\u2019 lives. The government must act now to prevent a human rights crisis in care.\u201d Families have become increasingly desperate. Last week, Ylenia Angeli, a 73-year-old retired nurse, was arrested after trying to remove her 97-year-old mother, who has dementia, from an east Yorkshire care home. Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, said: \u201cIt is possible to make visiting meaningful even within these strictures. There are people like Donna Pierpoint [manager of the Broomgrove Trust nursing home in Sheffield] who\u2019ve done whatever it will take. What we haven\u2019t had is a government that says \u2018whatever it takes\u2019. They\u2019re saying: \u2018It\u2019s important, but we\u2019ll leave it to you\u2019.\u201d The home Pierpoint runs has 40 residents, and she has ensured that each of them had at least one visit a week from June until local restrictions were introduced in the city two weeks ago. It will now be able to allow visits from Monday. So far the home has seen no coronavirus cases. \u201cWe are allowing touch \u2013 but the relatives have to wear gloves \u2013 and we are allowing them to give them a kiss \u2013 but they have to keep their mask on,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil we have regular testing for visitors, that\u2019s all we can do. The easy option is to stop visits because there\u2019s no work involved in it. You don\u2019t have to complete a risk assessment, write a policy or arrange this visiting timetable. It\u2019s easier for the managers. But they can\u2019t have hearts, that\u2019s all I can say. \u201cI spoke to a woman this morning whose father is in a care home in Rotherham. She hasn\u2019t seen him since March. Loneliness does kill. You won\u2019t see it on a death certificate, but people are dying of broken hearts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
