But we don\u2019t think we\u2019re the best vehicle for actively doing it.\u201d Currie argued that the ASA would struggle to move fast enough to regulate political adverts, particularly during an election. \u201cOur general processes would not be suitable for rapid responses that would be needed in the political case. But I don\u2019t see that as the major reason \u2013 I think the key one is that we are collectively self-regulated, and we rely on the buy-in of those we regulate. I don\u2019t see that the political parties have the willingness to buy in.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have enforcement by the industry. It\u2019s the industry that takes the ads down, and that aspect of it would be quite hard to replicate in the political sphere.\u201d The ASA stopped regulating political advertising in the 1990s, in part, Parker said, due to the fact that \u201cyou have to tread lightly when regulating political speech\u201d. The hearing comes after Facebook and Google were urged to impose a moratorium on all political advertising in the UK in the run-up to next month\u2019s election, by a group of campaigners who argued that \u201cthere is no time for regulations to catch up\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
