Also the Sunday Times and the Observer at the weekend because I work for them. I don't bother with any of the tabloids. Magazines: Oh God, hundreds. I have subscriptions to the Face, Arena, GQ, Vogue, Vanity Fair, and then I read W. I like Q and ID. I work for these magazines, so I like to know what's going on. Books: I've just finished At Swim, Two Boys by Jamie O'Neill. It's an amazing, amazing book, set in Ireland in 1915 to 1916 and very much concerned with the uprising. I'm reading The Consolations of Philosophy by Alain de Botton. I did a degree in philosophy and politics, so I'm still interested. My favourite book is Felice Picano's The Book of Lies - it's one of those books that I always recommend. TV: I don't watch much TV at all really. I do tend to watch films. What I never do is graze. People always tell me about what's happening on Who Wants to be a Millionaire or something, but I've never seen it! It's not snobbish. I'm invariably late, and these shows start at eight o'clock whether you're there or not. Radio: Radio 4 sometimes in the morning. I constantly flip between Heart, Virgin and Melody. Adverts: Washing powder ads and Direct Line are ghastly. I thought the Guinness ads were amazing. I shot Jonathan Glazer [their director], and they sent stills from the ad which I projected on to his face. New Media: I use the internet constantly. It's my first port of call for research. Whenever I'm shooting someone I research them first, even if it's just to make conversation. I just came back from LA where I shot the Osbournes. I totally fell for Sharon Osbourne. \u00b7 Jason Bell is a celebrity photographer.
