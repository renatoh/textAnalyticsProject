Louis Washkansky, the world's first heart transplant patient, died from lung infection after only 19 days because of an overdose of anti-rejection drugs, whose calculation was based on animal data obtained from dog experiments. The error was rectified in time to benefit the second transplant patient - Philip Blaiberg - who survived for 19 months and died of chronic rejection. However, what really surprised me was Barnard's admission to me in 1985 that animal experiments cannot teach us all we need to know - and that whatever we discover through animal experiments we must re-discover in humans. Using animals in research represents unsafe science because one cannot safely apply data obtained from them to humans. Colleen McDuling Sevenoaks, Kent For someone who professes to have a special interest in evolution, Robert Winston should know better than to engage in such shameless anthropocentricity. If, as he claims, animal testing is no longer cruel, then there is no reason why it should not be done exclusively on human volunteers. However, the real issue is not over how cruel these experiments are but over the fact that we impose them on non-consenting animals, for our own benefit. Evolution teaches us are that all living organisms are related, and that the concept of species is arbitrary and woolly, with no connotations of distinction or hierarchy.
