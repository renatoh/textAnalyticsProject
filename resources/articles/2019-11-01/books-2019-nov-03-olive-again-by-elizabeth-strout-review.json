Since then, Strout has written two acclaimed novels: My Name Is Lucy Barton \u2013 a recent stage version starred Laura Linney \u2013 and Anything Is Possible. She returns to Olive\u2019s world with Olive, Again, a deeply affecting book that cements Strout\u2019s reputation as one of the best writers of her generation. Like its predecessor, Olive, Again is made up of interconnected stories all set in a small town in Maine. It is two years since Olive\u2019s husband, Henry, died, and grief has not mellowed her: she is still brusque, unforgiving, formidable. But beneath the hard carapace \u2013 and this is where part of Strout\u2019s genius lies \u2013 is compassion, empathy and vulnerability, as Olive starts to feel aware of her own mortality. The 13 tales, told from a range of perspectives, explore Strout\u2019s preoccupations with grief, loneliness and familial torments. In the opening story, Jack Kennison \u2013 a retired Harvard academic whom Olive befriended at the end of Olive Kitteridge \u2013 ruminates on his strained relationship with his gay daughter, the death of his wife and much else in the way of life\u2019s regrets. Regrets \u2013 especially those concerning family \u2013 permeate the novel, not least Olive\u2019s troubles with her son, Chris. Having not seen him for three years, she invites him and his family to stay. It doesn\u2019t go well. In a particularly devastating scene, Olive recognises for the first time her own inadequacies as a mother: \u201cShe saw behind her closed eyes the house, and inside her was a shiver that went through her bones. The house where she had raised her son \u2013 never, ever realising that she herself had been raising a motherless child, now a long, long way from home.\u201d It\u2019s not only the older generation\u2019s perspective that Strout presents us with when tackling the vexed relations between parents and children. In another story, a teenage girl, Kayley, is coping with the loss of her father and her mother\u2019s lack of interest. \u201cThis is why they say a person\u2019s feelings hurt, because they do hurt.\u201d She takes a cleaning job for a local elderly couple, which results in a narrative turn both shocking and entirely authentic as Kayley seeks a substitute for paternal intimacy. But there is hope too. In the second story, Olive delivers a young woman\u2019s baby in the back of her car: life continues. In Light, a quietly arresting story, Olive visits a local woman who has cancer. The two discuss mortality, their relationships, their frustrations. But it\u2019s at the end of the story that Strout offers us a moment of near transcendence, as both women look out of the window in awe of the day\u2019s closing light. Strout\u2019s optimism supersedes the travails that beset her characters: \u201cYou could see how at the end of each day the world seemed to crack open and the extra light made its way across the stark trees and promised. It promised, that light, and what a thing that was.\u201d Throughout the book, disparate, disconnected people share transformative moments. In Helped, a woman terrified of being alone has a moving exchange about faith and loss with her father\u2019s elderly lawyer. Later, as the novel approaches its conclusion, Olive finds solace in female friendship, and Strout peels back the layers of her heroine\u2019s confidence and bravura to reveal a childhood rich in psychological complexity. Olive, Again is a tour de force. With extraordinary economy of prose \u2013 few writers can pack so much emotion, so much detail into a single paragraph \u2013 Strout immerses us in the lives of her characters, each so authentically drawn as to be deserving of an entire novel themselves. Compassionate, masterly and profound, this is a writer at the height of her powers. \u2022 Olive Again by Elizabeth Strout is published by Viking (\u00a314.99).
