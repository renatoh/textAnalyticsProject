The deal that would see the 22-year-old return to Serie A and the club of his choice hinges on the Premier League defending champions' asking price of \u20ac37m (\u00a331m). Balotelli's off-field antics \u2013 ranging from training ground fisticuffs to pyrotechnic mishaps \u2013 have raised questions about his temperament at City. But Galliani said Milan were still eager to sign the player, provided the price is right. He told Gazzetta dello Sport: \"At the end of Friday, Manchester City still said \u20ac37m. We will see on Monday. Under these conditions, he will remain at Manchester City.\" The Rossoneri are also seeking to re-hire one of their former players, the Real Madrid midfielder Kak\u00e1 whose spell in La Liga has been less than dazzling. Again, however, there is a cash caveat: Galliani says the 30-year-old's capture will require \"great effort\" from all parties \u2013 the Brazilian must take a pay cut. \"Everyone must make a great effort: Milan, Real Madrid and Kak\u00e1,\" he said. \"Much depends on [the player's] economic sacrifice. I have up days and down days. At the moment it is down because I look at the taxation \u2013 that kills. In Italy, no player earns more than \u20ac5m net.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
