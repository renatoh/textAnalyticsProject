Although work experience is meant to develop generic skills such as communication and turning up on time, to be successful it has to match the needs of individual students. That does make it difficult because there are limited places available. Also the challenge needs to match the student's ability. If it's motor vehicle maintenance, some are happy just to watch and hand a spanner. Others want a higher level of challenge. That's also true for students in an office: some are happy with photocopying and making tea, others are more skilled. The third area of difficulty is children with special needs. For some, getting the bus to work is a challenge and an opportunity. Schools and parents need to be upfront with the employer about the student's needs. Karen North Parent, Dorset Both my girls want to work with children so they went into the local first school, which was brilliant. Their school had a very good system: they came home with forms to fill in, they were sent to the appropriate placement and the school went in to check what they were doing and make sure they were happy. It's different if children don't know what they want to do and aren't motivated: then setting up work experience is hard work. My daughters got loads out of it. A bit of responsibility made them feel they were doing a proper job, which was great. You do hear of children being used as unpaid labour or not really getting any experience at all. Hazel Parnell Aged 16, from Sheffield I did work experience in July last year. I wanted to work for a magazine, but it's really difficult to get in; you have to know the right people. My friend's dad said I could work with him at an advertising company. I was there two weeks and it was really, really, really good. Before, I didn't know what I wanted to do and it made me realise that I want to be in advertising. It wasn't that bad finding something. The school gives you lots of paperwork to sign, and loads of help; you're meant to have found something by May or June and if people haven't found anything, they'll help them sort it out. Without work experience, you're in a bubble about how it's going to be when you get older. It's a shock going to work, but it's really important."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
