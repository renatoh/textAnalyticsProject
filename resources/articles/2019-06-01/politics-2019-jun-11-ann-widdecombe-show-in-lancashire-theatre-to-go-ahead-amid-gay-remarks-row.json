Tuesday night\u2019s Strictly Ann Widdecombe \u2013 An Intimate Evening With at the Lowther Pavilion in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, will be the first performance of the show since the former Conservative minister prompted outrage by saying that science \u201cmight produce an answer\u201d to being gay. Two other venues, the Landmark theatre in Ilfracombe and the Garrick theatre in Altrincham, cancelled Widdecombe\u2019s bookings after she made the remarks. Protesters are planning to demonstrate outside the Lowther Pavilion on Tuesday night an hour before the performance is due to begin, and a local arts listings group is threatening to withdraw its support for the theatre if the show goes ahead. But those running the Lowther Pavilion have defended the show on the grounds of freedom of expression. \u201cThe right of free speech in the theatre was long fought and should be protected so that all opinions can be represented,\u201d the theatre\u2019s management said in a statement. The Brexit party\u2019s leader, Nigel Farage, who hosted a business breakfast at the Lowther Pavilion in the run-up to the EU referendum, took a similar line. Last week he defended her remarks as a \u201cmatter of conscience\u201d. Lowther\u2019s chairman, Tim Lince, said: \u201cIn developing the theatre not every presentation or performance will appeal to everyone but our policies are proving successful in being able to present a broad spectrum of shows.\u201d Lancashire Arts, which says it has supported many shows at the venue, said it would no longer promote the pavilion in its listings. It claimed the theatre\u2019s managers had \u201cfailed to discern the difference between opinion and bigotry\u201d. In a statement it added: \u201cWe acknowledge that the Lowther is exercising its freedom of choice by hosting, and indeed commercially profiting from, this event. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019. An earlier version implied, incorrectly, that Lancashire Arts was a body which provided funding. Rather it is a group which promotes arts in the area via listings. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
