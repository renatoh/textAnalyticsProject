His warning about the enduring strength of old adversaries Bayern Munich did not. Wise heads rather than old legs told for the German champions as Liverpool were frustrated at home for the first time in this season\u2019s Champions League. They will hope for greater adventure from Niko Kovac\u2019s team at the Allianz Arena and to punish it. Klopp was involved in a heated exchange with his opposite number on the final whistle but, as he conceded afterwards: \u201cDay by day the result will feel better for us.\u201d Liverpool kept a clean sheet without Virgil van Dijk and with the goalkeeper Alisson offering Bayern greater opportunities than they engineered themselves. They extended their unbeaten run at home in Europe to 20 ties and maintained a record of never having lost to German opposition at Anfield. A goalless first-leg draw will also stir memories of the 1981 semi-final when Liverpool advanced on away goals in the second leg in Munich. But, on a cold and relatively flat February night the result felt like meagre consolation against a supposedly vulnerable Bayern team undergoing transition with Kovac. Anfield frustration stemmed not only from their opponents\u2019 resilient and organised defending. It was self-inflicted too. Sadio Man\u00e9 squandered a gilt-edged chance to change the complexion of the last 16 tie and Klopp lamented the succession of poor final balls that offered Bayern respite. Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were kept subdued, understandably so in the latter\u2019s case given he had suffered a virus 24 hours before kick-off. Bayern, their fans and Liverpool will expect, must show more willingness to attack on home soil in three weeks\u2019 time. Klopp\u2019s team will have to improve on three poor away performances so far in this season\u2019s competition to progress. \u201cNot perfect,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cBut good enough.\u201d The Champions League has provided an inspirational release for Liverpool during barren times in the Premier League but the dynamic has altered with Klopp\u2019s team in pursuit of the club\u2019s first championship since 1990. Perhaps that explained the lack of intensity and certainty in Liverpool\u2019s performance with a key domestic date awaiting at Manchester United on Sunday. Or perhaps, more likely, the team that has reigned supreme in Germany since 2012 was not the creaking, vulnerable unit advertised. Bayern were patient, intelligent but conservative in possession, a consequence of both Liverpool\u2019s pressing and their own contentment with a goalless stalemate. The visitors were encouraged forward more by Liverpool\u2019s defence giving up chances far too cheaply than their enthusiasm to support Robert Lewandowski. A dip in the defensive strength and organisation that has characterised Liverpool\u2019s title challenge might have been expected with Van Dijk serving a one-match suspension but his replacement, Fabinho, impressed greatly. The problem was Alisson\u2019s carelessness in possession. He had already escaped with one loose pass to Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara when dawdling too long on a Joel Matip back pass. Lewandowski hassled the Brazil international into an error that ended with Kingsley Coman shooting into the side-netting. In fairness to the Liverpool keeper he made a vital block from Matip when the central defender sliced a Serge Gnabry cross towards his own net. Liverpool closed the first half on top but their increasing threat proved deceptive in a tepid second half. Salah volleyed their first opportunity at Manuel Neuer when picked out by a superb ball over the top from Jordan Henderson, who impressed against Bayern\u2019s midfield three. The Egypt international also headed a clearer opening wide when Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s inviting lob found him unmarked at the back post. Liverpool\u2019s best chance landed at the feet of Man\u00e9 after Firmino had released Naby Ke\u00efta with a deft touch. Ke\u00efta\u2019s shot deflected off Niklas S\u00fcle to Man\u00e9 who, unmarked but with his back to goal, dragged a shot well wide on the turn. Man\u00e9 sought to make amends with a theatrical overhead kick from another deflected Ke\u00efta effort but with the same result. A trip on the Senegal international by Joshua Kimmich yielded the night\u2019s first booking and suspended the influential full back from the second leg. His absence may be felt at the Allianz Arena. Fabinho minimised the impact of Van Dijk\u2019s absence on Liverpool with a composed display in the heart of defence. Together, the Brazilian midfielder and Matip kept Lewandowski quiet, with Bayern\u2019s brightest moments provided by Coman and Gnabry down the flanks. The Poland striker\u2019s first sense of goal arrived from a Coman cross early in the second half but Fabinho intervened with a well-timed tackle. He produced another to prevent the France international leading a dangerous counterattack late on. The Bayern performance was increasingly safety-conscious the longer the stalemate remained, though inviting Liverpool forward in numbers was not without its risks. S\u00fcle was fortunate to see his clearance strike Andy Robertson and sail over Neuer but also wide of goal when he intercepted one Liverpool counter. Gnabry was required for a vital defensive touch just as Man\u00e9 sized up another sight of Neuer\u2019s goal as Liverpool searched for a breakthrough that, as a resigned Anfield appeared to sense, never seemed likely. \u201cWe had what we wanted from this game,\u201d Kovac tellingly admitted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
