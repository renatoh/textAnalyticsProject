For if this season's endless disputes over refereeing decisions have taught football fans one lesson, it is that the officials' job is getting harder and that \u2013 with the single exception of goalline cameras \u2013 no amount of technology will make an acceptable difference to the business of ensuring the right decisions are made. To use it to undermine their authority would be to invite anarchy. Every television camera in London seemed to be in use at the Emirates Stadium and Stamford Bridge last week, but you could watch the footage of the two hotly disputed red-card moments from every conceivable angle and still not come to a firm conclusion about the decisions to send off Manchester United's Fletcher and Barcelona's Abidal. Once Fletcher had nicked the ball away from Cesc F\u00e1bregas with his right boot, did the way his other foot tangled with the Arsenal captain's legs constitute a foul, or was it simply an inadvertent by-product of a legitimate intervention? When Nicolas Anelka went racing past Abidal 24 hours later, did the full-back's leg brush against those of his fellow Frenchman, or did Anelka simply trip over his own feet? In each case, the referee had a couple of seconds to assess the evidence and to make his decision. And, significantly, on neither occasion could any amount of television evidence settle the argument. Players are now so fit and fast that, with every piece of possession closely contested in a game increasingly based on mobility and movement, the visible distinction between fair and foul exchanges is constantly narrowing. When, as we saw last week, even super-slow-motion and high definition are unable to offer conclusive verdicts, we are better off accepting human decisions and the inevitable fallibility that goes with them, not least in the interests of preserving football's characteristic fluidity. In the stop-start game of rugby union, the video referee often takes minutes at a time to deliberate over the award or denial of a try that the pitch referee, left to deploy his own experience and instinctive judgment, would have got right perhaps 19 times out of 20. The delay is frustrating for players and spectators, and still sometimes leaves the truth in doubt. On Tuesday, Roberto Rosetti and his assistants got practically everything right. On Wednesday, Tom Henning Ovrebo came under sustained fire for his refusal to grant Chelsea a series of penalties, only Abidal's expulsion defusing the inevitable accusations of bias. And, of course, neither man was helped by the players' behaviour. Should we be more appalled by the Didier Drogba who rolls around in feigned agony while trying to get his opponents in trouble before committing a verbal assault on the referee or the one who spends 90 minutes impersonating a student of Kipling and Baden-Powell, apparently fired by an ambition to propagate the manly virtues of tolerance and fair play? That was the difference between the Drogba we saw at Stamford Bridge, when a place in the Champions League final was at stake, and the one who turned up at the Emirates four days later, knowing, the eyes of Uefa's disciplinary committee would be on him. Drogba will not learn the result of Uefa's deliberations into his post-match outburst for several weeks, and it is to be hoped that the punishment is made to fit the crime. But his club, too, should be sanctioned for the collective misbehaviour of their players. The withdrawal of their invitation to next season's Champions League, taking tens of millions of pounds in revenue along with it, would soon persuade them to find a way of curbing their players' excesses, and others would follow their example. If Chelsea's players and managerial staff are reluctant to abandon the exaggerated sense of grievance instilled and fostered by Jose Mourinho's regime, they will have to be taught a lesson. Petacchi sets wheels in motion to test Cavendish Sunday was meant to be a good day for Mark Cavendish. He started it by becoming the first British rider in the 100-year history of the Giro d'Italia to pull on the race leader's pink jersey. And then, as he set off with hopes of winning the stage from Venice to Trieste, came the news that Tom Boonen, his chief rival for the title of the world's best sprinter, had been suspended by his Quickstep team after again testing positive for cocaine. A year ago Boonen's first suspension kept him out of the Tour de France, leaving Cavendish to win four stages. Now the Belgian will be unable to fight the 23-year-old Manxman for the sprinters' green jersey. But the smile was wiped off Cavendish's face on Sunday afternoon when he crossed the finish line a bike length behind a hero of an earlier era, the 35-year-old Alessandro Petacchi, who also won yesterday's stage after Cavendish was delayed behind a multiple pile-up. An extremely useful lesson in adversity for the young man, at a time when he must have been starting to feel unbeatable. Competing is the ultimate pay-off, Button reminds us The world of sport has not yet gone entirely mad. Here is Jenson Button, talking about his decision to shed millions of pounds from his salary in order to contribute to the survival of the Brawn grand prix team: \"I understand that drivers are paid a great amount of money. We are paid because we are the best in the world, yet we must not lose sight of the fact that we do this because we love motor racing. When I was a kid, I didn't think, 'I want to be a formula one driver because I want to make shedloads of wedge'.\" And here is Michel Platini, a great man routinely demonised by British football's rabid xenophobes: \"Why is football so popular? Because for 100 years people worked for this game, which meant that they had TV rights to sell. And now, because of that, people want to change football, because they want to make more money.\" Keeping up with motorbike racing just got a lot tougher Like most of the media, I managed to miss Bradley Smith's victory in the 125cc motorcycle grand prix at Jerez last week. Smith, who is now 18 but still looks like a member of William Brown's Outlaws, has been threatening to win a race for some time. Last summer his compatriot Scott Redding became the youngest winner of a two-wheeled grand prix at 15. Along with the 18-year-old Danny Webb, also competing in the 125s, Smith and Redding represent a promising future for British motorbike racing. Fred the Shred fails to make the cut at St Andrews Sir Fred Goodwin may be hanging on to his knighthood and pension, but the Royal and Ancient Golf Club have found a way to hit him where it really hurts. His name has been taken off the waiting list for membership at St Andrews. richard.williams@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
