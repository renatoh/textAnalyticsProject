It has a keen eye for detail and some lovely moments, though it also descends to a few platitudes at times. Almost every reviewer has compared it to The Graduate, but it reminded me much more strongly of Ted Demme's Beautiful Girls. That included an unforgettable performance by the 15-year-old Natalie Portman, who lights up this film too in a similar set-up (troubled young man goes back to old neighbourhood). Portman was perfectly terrible in her Star Wars role but give her a proper script and a believable character and she's hard to beat. The old neighbourhood in this case is New Jersey \"the garden state\", where our hero, an actor, is known mainly for his role as a mentally-ill quarterback. He has been on medication for years - for reasons we gradually discover - but is now sampling pill-free real life again. Braff, an actor in the TV series Scrubs and a New Jersey native in real life, stuffs his cast with eccentric, mostly interesting characters - like the inventor of \"silent Velcro\" and a couple living in a boat at the bottom of a quarry, and Ian Holm brings gravitas to his role as his psychologist father."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
