Meet fashion's formidable silent force", "bodyText": "If the familiar list of the most influential fashion figures is beginning to sound predictable \u2013 sorry Anna, sorry Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 meet someone who wields no less influence but is not (yet) a household name: Elizabeth von der Goltz. As the global buying director for Net-a-Porter, the world\u2019s largest multibrand luxury retailer, von der Goltz is to fashion what a conductor is to the orchestra: everyone looks to her to see what\u2019s coming next. Her role is to scout, source and nurture brands and designers (from established to emerging, in everything from lingerie to sportswear); cut deals in order sell their designs; and to do everything she can to support the brand and its sales. That\u2019s the basic outline. In reality, her job is a task of titanic proportions. Von der Goltz\u2019s much-coveted position demands a nose for new talent and a finely honed instinct for trends \u2013 clothes as well as concepts \u2013 years before they materialise. And she must do that with the conviction of someone unfazed by the multi-million-pound budgets she is responsible for, and the confidence of someone who understands the cultural differences between the 170 countries that Net-a-Porter serves. She is fashion\u2019s formidable silent force, yet on every occasion I\u2019ve encountered her \u2013 whether navigating an army of street-style photographers fighting to get her picture in the rain, or being delayed for two hours on board a London-Milan flight and missing countless appointments \u2013 she is never anything but calm, cool and approachable, with a mega-watt smile. Little wonder she is a part of a wave of retail directors attracting attention. Whereas in the past these roles remained relatively under the radar outside of the fashion industry, they are now basking in widespread recognition. \u201cIt really has changed. I don\u2019t know if any of us anticipated it. I didn\u2019t,\u201d laughs von der Goltz, 46, who has nearly 25 years\u2019 experience. \u201cI think people didn\u2019t understand before. Even when I was in school, I didn\u2019t think about how fashion gets into the store. Now people are thinking: \u2018Who\u2019s behind it? Who are these people?\u2019 And it\u2019s not just fashion. People are so much more interested in what happens behind the scenes.\u201d Von der Goltz\u2019s recent appearance on the Netflix hit Next in Fashion, which saw 10 fledgling designers battle it out to win a $250,000 prize and sell their collections on Net-a-Porter, is one of the many ways the veil is being lifted. As a guest judge on the series finale, von der Goltz was arguably the most important person on the panel. The cash prize might sound impressive, but becoming a success on her product pages affords a designer the widespread recognition necessary to make them several times the prize money and validates everything they\u2019ve worked for. On the flipside, if a designer isn\u2019t ready, it could spell catastrophe. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge consideration,\u201d says von der Goltz, her chirpy American accent placing the emphasis on huge. \u201cAt Net-a-Porter we have three warehouses we ship to around the world \u2013 London, New York and Hong Kong \u2013 so even when we\u2019re buying a small buy, it\u2019s actually huge! We can make or break a brand and so we have a responsibility to help them develop and evolve, because we almost change the structure of their company just by asking them to complete our order.\u201d She compares it to a marriage: \u201cYou have to believe that they\u2019re ready to build a business, because then we\u2019re in it for a long time.\u201d Von der Goltz has form for placing her bets wisely. By her own humble admission she has been \u201cextremely influential\u201d for years. Before taking the top job at the London-based juggernaut in 2017, von der Goltz was the designer buyer for 16 years at Fifth Avenue landmark store Bergdorf Goodman, where, she says, \u201cbrands \u2013 even big designers \u2013 would come to me for advice\u201d. Far from just selling fashion, she is responsible for the existence of fashion houses. The founders of Monse, who are also creative directors at Oscar de la Renta, first came to von der Goltz with sketches \u2013 now it\u2019s one of New York fashion week\u2019s highlights. She persuaded Valentino to start producing the pre-fall and cruise collections. \u201cI told them, work with me, we need this delivery. If it works, I\u2019m totally happy for you to sell it to the rest of the world,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it\u2019s huge business!\u201d What von der Goltz gives out in support, she gets back tenfold. Vincent Ho, co-founder of the avant-garde New York collective Peter Do, which started on Instagram, calls her a fairy godmother. \u201cShe works for Net-a-Porter, but she\u2019s really helpful to our brand \u2013 telling us what to look out for,\u201d Ho says. \u201cShe\u2019s always accessible \u2013 whether it\u2019s through an Instagram DM, an email, or a text, she\u2019s willing to help us at any given moment. And she\u2019s so personable,\u201d Ho says with a hint of mischief. \u201cShe responds to stories; she talks about food \u2013 she\u2019s one of us.\u201d Von der Goltz has had a front row seat not just to every fashion show but at every major fashion evolution for the best part of the last two decades \u2013 and right now is no different. Her arrival at Net-a-Porter also coincided with one of the most polarising eras in fashion, with the spotlight on sustainability highlighting the unmanageable volume of clothing in the world. Federico Marchetti, CEO of Net-a-Porter, told Women\u2019s Wear Daily in December that its 10 distribution centres worldwide total \u201calmost 100 soccer fields in eight countries\u201d. While a buyer plays a key role in an industry that has been heavily criticised for creating and selling too much stuff, von der Goltz is characteristically articulate and informed. \u201cThe customer doesn\u2019t need to choose between style or sustainability any longer \u2013 they can now have both,\u201d she tells me over email after our call. \u201cThe product we buy \u2013 and therefore what our customers buy \u2013 is particularly important as the production of fashion and textiles has a significant impact on the welfare of people and ecosystems.\u201d On her watch, Net-a-Porter has launched two things she is passionate about: the Vanguard programme, which gives new designers access to the entire company, including legal, marketing and business development teams; and Net Sustain, which platforms community, craft and locally sourced products. Putting sustainability at the top of the agenda is integral to any buyer\u2019s reputation right now: \u201cOur aim is to give a voice to the brands on site, big or small, that are truly making positive changes by providing them with a platform to highlight their best practice.\u201d She points to \u201cthe advancement of data, AI and VR capabilities\u201d increasingly aiding the buyer\u2019s role in the future. Von der Goltz is good at adapting. Born in New York, her family were globetrotters \u2013 her father was in private equity, her mother an art gallerist. Tokyo, London and then Hong Kong called, where she grew up with her older brother and went to the German-Swiss school. An art history degree in Washington DC followed, including an internship at Christie\u2019s in London. A career in art was not for her, she discovered, but the formative years and inherited talents for business and creativity proved invaluable. \u201cYou really have to have two sides of the brain to be a buyer, because so much of the work is financial and analytical. We have to grow our business double digits year on year. But the other side takes a lot of instinct, taste and creativity, because you\u2019re the one setting the trends of what people are buying.\u201d Note that this is always at least six months in advance, so there\u2019s no temperature- taking from the style on the street. After Hong Kong, on the advice of a friend who worked at the legendary fashion boutique Joyce, von der Goltz relocated to New York to pursue her love of fashion. After landing a temping position at Barneys (\u201cIt was my Mecca!\u201d) she put her head down and eventually became an assistant buyer in the \u201cprivate label\u201d area of the store, which at the time was designed by Dutch designer Ronald Van Der Kemp. It was 1997 \u2013 and the break she needed. \u201cIn that role, you didn\u2019t just buy, you started from complete scratch; everything from ordering the sample fabric to the finish of a garment. It was a great place to start, because I learned so much about fabrication, how much fabric it takes to make a jacket, production in Italy, all of that. I feel fabrics now and designers say, \u2018This is expensive because it comes from this mill\u2019, and I\u2019m like: \u2018I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about!\u2019\u201d After working her way up through Barneys, a brief spell at the now closed New York institution Henri Bendel, and her nearly two decades at Bergdorf\u2019s, von der Goltz was already an industry authority \u2013 especially when it came to what makes a good buyer. Being an excellent negotiator is mandatory: \u201cWe negotiate down to the core with each of our brands \u2013 it\u2019s all about margin and probability, so you have to have that leadership voice in the industry.\u201d You also need to have a great world view. \u201cI love people with a liberal arts background who read fiction, watch movies, travel, love art and architecture, because so much of what we\u2019re doing is influenced by the culture around us. The customer is global, so you have to understand who she is, what\u2019s she doing every day; when she\u2019s travelling; what she\u2019s seeing, what her hobbies are.\u201d When in London, where she is based full-time now with her husband Andreas, she practises what she preaches. In between managing a team of 50, relentless schedules of back-to-back meetings and round-the-world attendances at London, Milan, Paris, Shanghai, Copenhagen, Seoul, Sydney and Tbilisi fashion weeks, she keeps her finger on the pulse. As for what the woman who presents women with what to wear wears, von der Goltz looks forward to getting dressed every day and brushes off any suggestion of pressure \u2013 even if she is becoming one of fashion\u2019s most photographed people. \u201cI innately love fashion!\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI love clothes \u2013 even when I\u2019m doing Pilates or I\u2019m in the mountains, I have an idea of how I want to look in my head.\u201d Favourites include Gabriela Hearst, Altuzarra, Citizens of Humanity and, of course, Peter Do, which give her what she calls a mix of high and low. She adds: \u201cComfort and confidence are always most important.\u201d Perhaps another reason why von der Goltz has enjoyed such a long and successful career is that she\u2019s not afraid to say the things that, 10 years ago, would have been considered sacrilege in the fashion buyer\u2019s rulebook. First up: money doesn\u2019t necessarily buy you style. \u201cThere is not a defined way of saying someone has style or not \u2013 if you have the money, you have access, but there are so many people out there with the most amazing style wearing clothes from the high street.\u201d Second, there are no rules. \u201cThe world has changed so much that\u2019s it\u2019s not about trends dictating any more, so you can express yourself,\u201d she says. But maybe look for her cue, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
