It shows the same masterly ensemble control. The film is in many ways a precursor to kitchen-sink movies like Saturday Night and Sunday Morning \u2013 and that huge, teeming market scene bears comparison with Carn\u00e9's Les Enfants du Paradis. It follows a typical Sunday in a working-class neighbourhood. It's raining of course, but there's nothing dull and Sunday-ish about what's going to happen. Googie Withers is Rose, a former barmaid who has settled for marriage with a dull but steady widower with children. Handsome escaped convict Tommy Swann (John McCallum) turns up in their garden shed, pleading for help: she and Tommy were once sweethearts and his reappearance rekindles dangerous memories of their passionate love. Instantly, respectable Rose gambles everything on helping Tommy beat the law. Jack Warner plays the fatherly copper and Sydney Tafler is Morry, the roguish bandleader carrying on with Rose's pretty stepdaughter. Could it be that everyone except Tommy is a prisoner in some way? The drama is managed without condescension and with enormous skill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
