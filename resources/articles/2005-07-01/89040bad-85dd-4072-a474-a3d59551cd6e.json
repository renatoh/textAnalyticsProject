More than 60 people, ranging from local teenagers and middle-class students to activists from Spain and Italy, appeared before sheriffs following the riots. A spokesman for the Crown Office said 61 people appeared at Edinburgh sheriff court yesterday charged with a variety of offences. The vast majority of the defendants pleaded not guilty and were released on bail with strict conditions. Courts and the police in Scotland are determined there will not be a repeat of Monday's scenes in either Edinburgh or around Gleneagles when the summit gets under way today. Protesters were bailed on the condition they did not enter Edinburgh city centre, Perth and Kinross or Stirlingshire. They must also attend their local police station each day until Sunday. One defence solicitor said the conditions amounted to his client being deported. Eddie Wilson - representing Christopher Pin-McElroy, of Hove, Sussex - said: \"The crown are seeking effectively to deport this man and return him to his address in Hove. This amounts to deportation from Scotland.\" Another defendant, David Williams, from Sale, Cheshire, refused to accept the bail conditions and was remanded in custody. His solicitor, Nigel Beaumont, said his client was a chartered accountant with no previous convictions who would not accept \"substantial restrictions\" on his human rights. The public were barred from entering Edinburgh sheriff court yesterday and security was tight as vans carrying the prisoners arrived. The vans swayed as protesters inside banged the walls. In the courts, however, it was a more subdued affair. The first protester, John Mackie, from Midlothian, was before court four at 11am. He pleaded not guilty to breach of the peace and made no comment. It was a scene repeated throughout the day. Although some of the protesters who appeared in court were from continental Europe - including Spain, and Denmark - the majority were from Scotland and England. Dissent, the anarchist umbrella group which organised Monday's violent protests, had advised protesters to try not to get arrested before the G8 summit gets under way. \"Don't get nicked before July 6,\" it says on its website. Police fear hardline anarchist and anti-capitalist protesters, some from European groups like Black Bloc, are gearing up for more trouble today. They say they have intelligence reports that activists plan to increase their protests as the G8 leaders arrive in Scotland this afternoon. The majority of protesters appearing in court yesterday were charged with public order offences such as breach of the peace. One man was charged under the firearms act while others were charged with drugs and weapons offences. During the court appearances prosecutors also intimated they were reviewing evidence to pursue other more serious charges relating to rioting against some of the defendants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
