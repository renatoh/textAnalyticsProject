The French defender, one of only two players to keep their places after Sunday's Community Shield win over Arsenal, needed lengthy treatment on an ankle after an aerial dual with Gifton Noel-Williams. Gary Neville is already doubtful for Saturday's Premiership start against Bolton and brother Phil and Quinton Fortune are carrying knocks. Silvestre was substituted 17 minutes from time. Another unhappy Frenchman was Fabien Barthez, recalled to United's goal in place of Tim Howard. Barthez was at fault on Stoke's second goal when he was lobbed from 30 yards by Marc Goodfellow who had already struck Stoke's first goal. Barthez was later beaten again by Chris Iwelumo while Diego Forlan claimed United's consolation. Nicolas Anelka has quashed speculation about a national team comeback by saying the manager of France, Jacques Santini, must beg \"on his knees in front of me\". Anelka quit the French national team in November 2002 after a last-minute call-up. He said, in an interview with Paris Match: \"I don't need the French team. What I achieve with Manchester satisfies me. The system sickens me and I'm not going to force myself to kiss up to anyone. Maybe, if Santini gets down on his knees in front of me and says 'sorry' then I'll think about it later.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
