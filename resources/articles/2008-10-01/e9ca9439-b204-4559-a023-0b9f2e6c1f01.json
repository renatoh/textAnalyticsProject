Giulia Bongiorno, one of Sollecito's lawyers, said that two calls made from Kercher's mobile around 10pm on November 1 last year, the night she died, locked on to a cell phone antenna some distance from the house where her body was found, close to the spot the phone was discovered abandoned the next morning. \"This proves that the calls were made by the killer after fleeing with the phone,\" said Bongiorno. \"That means Kercher was killed before 10pm, and we can prove that Sollecito was at home at 9.46pm at his computer, using an interactive online cartoon website. That is not enough time for him to have got to Kercher's house,\" she said. A judge will decide next week whether to send to trial Sollecito, 24, and Kercher's housemate, American student Amanda Knox, 21. A third suspect, Ivory Coast born Rudy Guede, 21, has requested a fast track trial and will be sentenced next week. Police say DNA belonging to Sollecito was found on a clasp from the bra worn by Kercher, who was found semi-naked with her throat cut. Investigators admit the clasp was only picked up by police off Kercher's bedroom floor on December 18, by which time it had been involuntarily moved from the position it had been first been spotted, and stained with blood. Forensic scientist Patrizia Stefanoni has said the use of protective shoes by police meant no rogue DNA could have been trodden into the clasp. But lawyer Luca Maori yesterday showed a police video indicating that objects including a lamp and cupboard doors had been taken from, then brought back into the room, \"meaning DNA could easily have brought introduced to Meredith's room by the time the clasp was collected,\" he said. The legal team defending Sollecito also dressed a mannequin in a bra to show how Sollecito could not have sliced through Kercher's bra strap as she was allegedly being stabbed in the throat by Knox. \"You could not cut the strap without holding it with the other hand,\" he said. \"Where is Raffaele's DNA on the rest of the strap?\" Sollecito and his former girlfriend Knox exchanged smiles in court yesterday, while Guede took notes. All deny killing and sexually assaulting Kercher."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
