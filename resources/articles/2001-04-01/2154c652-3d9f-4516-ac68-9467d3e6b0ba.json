This week the focus is on Beethoven - three programmes of chamber music entrusted to \"Joshua Bell and Friends\". There are trios and the Septet to come, but for the opening concert on Friday the violinist brought just one friend: German pianist Alexander Lonquich, for three of the violin sonatas. Yet it wasn't the most auspicious start to a series that promised so much high-quality music-making. No performance by Bell is without something to remember - he is far too good and instinctive an artist for that. Here, though, he seemed unsettled and too often technically on edge. The Op 23 Sonata in A minor, and Op 24, the Spring, in F made an obvious coupling for the first half. Despite their different opus numbers Beethoven conceived them as a pair, but a contrasting pair, whereas Bell and Lonquich seemed much more concerned with emphasising their similarities. That they attacked the sforzandi in the first movement of Op 23 with such zeal and brought out the rhythmic instability in its finale was fair enough, even though the piano tended sometimes to overwhelm the violin. But surely even the second subject of the opening movement of the Spring Sonata doesn't need to be delivered in such a brutal way. The poise with which Bell had floated the opening theme was totally undermined, while the twist into the minor key just before the end was rendered more important than the rest of the finale. In Beethoven's last violin sonata, Op 96 in G major, all the elements were held in a better balance. There was rather more of the gilded phrasing that one associates with Bell, and more sensitive responses from Lonquich, too. But the technical insecurities continued, and lapses of intonation continued to mar Bell's playing. Perhaps it was just a bad day at the office for the violinist; we know he can play far better than this. \u0095 Further concerts Tuesday and Saturday.
