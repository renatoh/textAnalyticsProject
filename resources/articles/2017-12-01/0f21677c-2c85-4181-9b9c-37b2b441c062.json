Wray\u2019s comments came in response to Clermont\u2019s furious reaction to the match being rescheduled for 5.30pm on Monday, labelling the situation as \u201ca tale of the absurd\u201d, 24 hours after the game was postponed because of hazardous conditions around the stadium. The French side complained that they had not been included in negotiations between the tournament organisers, EPCR, and Saracens, over when the match was to be played, accusing them of \u201cmessing about\u201d their fans and treating them like \u201ctoys\u201d after the game was postponed on Sunday morning because of bad weather. Clermont won the rescheduled game 46-14, inflicting a record home European defeat on their opponents. Supporters were able to attend the match at Allianz Park, after tournament organisers initially announced that the match would be played behind closed doors \u201cdue to health and safety concerns\u201d. In a statement, the Top 14 side said that they were originally told the rearranged start would be 2pm GMT on Monday and were not informed of a change to 5.30pm until late on Sunday evening. \u201cThe weekend should have been a rugby celebration between the two European finalists; whatever happens on the Allianz Park pitch this afternoon, it will remain yet another episode of the amateurism that sometimes affects our sport,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWithout consulting any members of the staff (and with no official information) throughout the day ... we were eventually informed by phone by a member of the EPCR at about 5pm that the match would take place on Monday December 11 at 2pm.\u2019 \u201cWe were told at 11pm that the game which was scheduled for 2pm had been moved to 5.30pm local time, with no way of telling the players who were already back in their rooms.\u201d Saracens, however, took issue with the fact that EPCR released a statement late on Sunday night, saying that the match would be played behind closed doors. On Monday morning, Saracens issued a response insisting the match would be open to the public. Wray then said: \u201cI thought [EPCR\u2019s closed-doors statement] was outrageous. It was a unilateral statement, we had been promised there would be consultation, it was not what had been discussed \u2013 it was an outrageous statement. \u201cI understand what Clermont are saying, it\u2019s annoying from everybody\u2019s point of view. It\u2019s important to stress the health and safety officer made his decision, it\u2019s nothing to do with us.\u201d Wray revealed that he anticipated a loss of approximately \u00a3300,000 from the match. \u201cWe\u2019re quite big losers because we\u2019ve lost a sell-out crowd and will make a substantial loss,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am a big fan of fans, and it\u2019s not the way it should have been done. My views on organisations like EPCR and the RFU is that they\u2019re all chaotic. I don\u2019t think they work and this is another example of why.\u201d \u201cThe idea that you kick-off at 2pm \u2013 that\u2019s great for television, isn\u2019t it, for the gate \u2013 when we\u2019re supposed to be promoting the game and getting the best possible environment. I think it\u2019s been chaotic.\u201d Clermont\u2019s statement also addressed the uncertainty over whether fans could attend. \u201cThe match was initially set to be played behind closed doors \u2026 disappointing our fans yet again who then decided to return home to France the following morning.\u201d \u201cThe latest information is that the game could take place in front of supporters, hence Saracens\u2019 interest in moving the game to later in the evening, refusing the proposition of the EPCR (2pm kick-off). In the end, for about a dozen centimetres of snow, the organisation of the game has bordered on the ridiculous and the absurd.\u201d The EPCR president, Vincent Galliard was unimpressed with Clermont\u2019s statement and defended the decision to postpone the game. He said: \u201cThe reaction of Clermont \u2013 I am angry about. The magnitude of what happened was grossly underestimated \u2013 it was very serious and the decision to postpone the match was the right decision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
