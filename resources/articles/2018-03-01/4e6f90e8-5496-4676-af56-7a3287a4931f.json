J\u00e1n Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, both 27, were found shot dead at their home near Bratislava on 25 February. Police have said Kuciak\u2019s death was \u201cmost likely\u201d related to an investigation of his that resulted in an article on alleged ties between Slovakia\u2019s top politicians and the Italian mafia, which his employer posthumously published. Slovak media called Friday\u2019s protest in the capital, Bratislava, the biggest since the 1989 Velvet revolution that toppled communism in Czechoslovakia. Thousands marched in other Slovak cities, while hundreds of people gathered in cities in Europe and elsewhere. Organisers demanded a thorough investigation of Kuciak\u2019s death and a \u201cnew trustworthy government\u201d. \u201cPoliticians in power have lost our trust,\u201d said protester Maria Kuliovska, a 30-year-old mother on maternity leave. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust them to guarantee an independent investigation. They have failed to investigate all previous scandals.\u201d Kuciak\u2019s journalism and then his murder have rekindled public frustration with the government\u2019s failure to tackle graft and cronyism in Slovakia nearly three decades after the fall of communism and 14 years after it joined the European Union. Fico has led the country of 5.4 million people for 10 of the last 12 years and the economy has flourished, but the protesters in the capital, Bratislava, on Friday \u2013 estimated at up to 50,000 by the public broadcaster \u2013 chanted \u201cEnough of Fico\u201d and jangled keys just as they did in 1989 anti-communist rallies. President Andrej Kiska, a political rival of Fico, has said Slovakia is suffering a crisis of trust and has called for a revamp of the three-party coalition or an early election. Kiska, Fico and parliamentary speaker Andrej Danko \u2013 the country\u2019s three highest officials \u2013 failed to agree a planned written declaration to help defuse tensions in talks on Friday. After their meeting, flanked by the president and prime minister, Danko read a brief statement: \u201cWe want society to remain peaceful and calm and [Slovakia\u2019s] top three officials will do their best to prevent the events of recent days from being politically exploited.\u201d Police and state officials, including Fico, had warned of potential violence at demonstrations, though there were no reports of disruption. Fico has accused foreign forces of trying to destabilise Slovakia and has questioned the president\u2019s meetings with financier George Soros in New York last year without any foreign ministry official being present. The attack on the Hungarian-born billionaire echoes those of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who has accused Soros of interfering in Hungarian politics. Fico said he would meet his two coalition partners at the weekend to seek a deal to keep the government in place. He has resisted a call from the inter-ethnic Most-Hid party to sack interior minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k, his close ally. Some analysts say Fico\u2019s coalition could break up, although he might be able to continue leading a minority government with the backing of a far-right party in parliament. Martin Slosiarik, an analyst at Focus polling agency, said Fico had never faced a crisis on this scale. \u201cKuciak\u2019s last story has had a serious impact on people\u2019s trust in the system of government, and the murder of two young people has added a strong moral aspect,\u201d he said. This article was amended on 10 March 2018. The picture caption incorrectly stated Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k was the foreign minister. He is the interior minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
