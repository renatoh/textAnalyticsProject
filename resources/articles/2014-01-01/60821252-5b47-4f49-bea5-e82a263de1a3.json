There were jokes about young women \u2013 and male Hollywood's predilection for them. There were jokes about weight loss, and jokes about Hollywood's ageism: \"Meryl Streep is so brilliant in August: Osage County, proving that there are still great parts in Hollywood for Meryl Streeps over 60.\" But fixing the gender balance \u2013 and it's not fixed, if you're a female director, a female screenwriter or a woman of color in just about any career path in Hollywood \u2013 doesn't mean other problems were solved. Viewers were indeed so enchanted by the Fey-Poehler juggernaut that some of the more off-putting things celebrities did during Sunday night's broadcast were almost completely swept under the sewage-soaked red carpet. Almost. That limo driver joke Though most of her jokes were home runs, Amy Poehler (a winner in her own right \u2014 Parks and Rec!) made a joke about attendees having sex with limo drivers that caused one of the few noticeable dips in volume from the crowd: Before earning a Golden Globe nomination for his first ever acting role in Captain Phillips, Barkhad Abdi was working as a limousine driver in Minnesota. There's such a beautiful life lesson here, everyone: Sleep with your limo driver tonight. Before he gets famous. Nothing illustrates the awkwardness of this situation more than this reaction shot from Abdi himself: Personally, I really enjoyed this analysis: Michael Douglas is still a bit homophobic when he talks about portraying Liberace Let's move on to Michael Douglas's acceptance speech for his leading role in Behind the Candelabra, the HBO movie about Liberace. What he said Sunday night was a marked improvement on his Emmys speech, in which he asked costar Matt Damon whether he wanted the bottom or the top, but that doesn't mean it was good. Douglas unleashed another off-color remark, telling the audience that when Steven Soderbergh first talked to him about playing Liberace during the filming of another movie, \u201cI thought maybe I was mincing a little bit in the part that I was doing.\u201d I can't tell if Twitter is really mad at him or not, but here's an unscientific roundup of the opinions I've seen floating around the ether: Hollywood's basic motor skills were put to the test onstage The Globes' famous open bar is often thought to bear the blame for some of the wilder moments we see from presenters and award winners. In a bit of apparent mockery, Emma Thompson walked onstage barefoot, martini glass in one hand, Louboutins in the other. And this, as Hadley Freeman wrote Sunday, is \"why the world loves Emma Thompson\". But Thompson had nothing on best supporting actress winner Jacqueline Bisset, who was the first to test out the show's five-second delay, talking straight through the \"get off the stage\" music and prompting many a viewer to question whether or not she had been drinking. (Bisset's official response is that she was stunned by her win.) As she was the sole female winner from a slew of British nominees, I'd still say Bisset did her homeland proud. Speaking of the British, bumbling American\u2122 Leo DiCaprio managed to refer to Philomena as \"Philomania\". Woody Allen's lifetime achievement award, and the molestation allegations The most \"everybody cringe!\" moment of the evening was as awkward as it was for a few reasons. It started when Diane Keaton accepted Woody Allen's Cecil B DeMille award on the director's behalf. It should be noted that Keaton is wonderful and adorable, and that she can rock menswear better than George Clooney on his best day and, also, that she gets a little buzzed on daytime TV. But her speech was a bit odd, especially at the end. Though she sang it in a a sweet, clear Annie Hall voice, Keaton's tribute to Woody invoked the Girl Scouts' song Make New Friends, which I hadn't heard since I was scowling at my troop leader in 1996. The speech was weird and it was funny. But as soon as the song was over and Keaton flounced offstage, the awkwardness from her performance was overshadowed by Allen's maybe-son Ronan Farrow, resurfacing some old allegations of sexual abuse by Allen: An article about Mia Farrow from November's Vanity Fair suggests that the woman Ronan Farrow was referring to is his sister Dylan, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and Allen. In the piece, Dylan Farrow, who now goes by another name, is quoted speaking for the first time about the allegations that Allen abused her, which have been public for some time. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything formally wrong was going on \u2026 The things making me uncomfortable were making me think I was a bad kid, because I didn\u2019t want to do what my elder told me to do.\" Allen was never charged, and has denied that he ever abused Dylan.
