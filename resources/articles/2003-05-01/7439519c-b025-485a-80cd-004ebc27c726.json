There's nowhere left that sells these things at all?\" \"You'll be lucky.\" I think I'm more lucky that there's a counter between the two of us. It means he can't see that my trousers are not only unseemingly tight, but also five inches too short. These aren't my own clothes. I am wearing next season's Prada. The influence for the collection was the \"impeccable style of young Londoners in the 1960s\", and the print is from the archives of Holliday and Brown, a traditional British tie-maker popular in that decade. Dressed head-to-toe in this gear, I feel like Tommy Steele. But today on Carnaby Street there is no one else dressed like me. Instead, it is a tourist trap that houses a mix of sport shops and novelty outlets. In fact, it feels so sad around there, and so unlike what you think it should be, I began to wonder if the tales of swinging Carnaby are more myth than truth. I call someone who was around at the time and whose opinion I trust - my mother. \"Carnaby Street summed up everything without being anything itself,\" she says. My parents met at the Slade School of Fine Art in London in 1964, just when the look was breaking into the mainstream. \"Your father bought this fantastic suit from some little shop, it was unstructured and impeccably cut. Carnaby Street was full of Italian tailoring shops, with small production lines and little turnover. They seemed to change hands all the time.\" This is why the truth of Carnaby Street might seem alien to shoppers today. Then the important thing was the quality of the individual garment, regardless of brand or advertising campaign. Even if it was from an unheard-of label, if it looked good, then that was enough. In 2003, we're unsure of any style unless it is sourced from well-established shops and brands. It is also the reason why none of these shops are left on Carnaby Street. They were only thinking of the clothing of the moment, not building a long-term brand strategy. When the street became a tourist trap and the rents rose, the tailors couldn't afford to stick around. Sonnet Stanfill is curating a display at the V&amp;A Museum about the 60s designer Ossie Clark that opens in July. She has spent the past year researching the period. \"What's come from all my work is how fresh it was at the time, that fashion was constantly changing and breaking the rules,\" she says. I would love it if men still aspired to be flamboyant, but the looks I am getting are not welcoming. Beer drinkers leer at one end, tourist shops at the other think what I'm wearing is a joke. Worn as a complete outfit, next season's Prada is not going to make you feel safe on the streets of London. But the way I'm wearing it is straight-off-the-catwalk. Only a Prada completist would buy it entirely - real shoppers will cherry-pick and adapt to their own look. In the cab on the way back, I take the tie off and put on my khaki utility jacket. The optic pattern actually flatters when placed under something neutral. Because I'm lanky, I don't normally wear busy patterns on my top half in case I look like the flashing beacon of a lighthouse. But with restraint, I might give this sort of thing a go. There is much to be said for enjoying bits of the 60s from the comfort of a 21st-century perspective. Veterans of the time had the excitement of being first, but we get the chance to exploit their advances. If you go to a vintage boutique and try the original stuff on, the fabrics are scratchy, the designs bulky, the look sometimes surprisingly dowdy. But certain bits of the style - a simple colour-block shift dress for women, a sharp silhouetted suit for men - will easily adapt into people's wardrobes from designers such as Marc Jacobs and Prada (or the high-street versions promised by New Look and Marks and Spencer). This is the biggest difference. To be fashionable back then, you had to take a deep breath and be bold with your style. Nowadays if you get scared, you can go home, change, and feel safe in the mundane once more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
