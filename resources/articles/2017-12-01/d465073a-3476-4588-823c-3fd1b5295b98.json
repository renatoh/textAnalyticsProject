In a strongly worded statement expressing solidarity with Ireland, Tusk said Brexit problems were of Britain\u2019s own making, but Ireland\u2019s problems were the EU\u2019s. He warned that progress would not be possible if the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, was not satisfied with the UK\u2019s offer on the Irish border, which is scheduled to be tabled in Brussels on Monday. Ireland, which is looking for written commitment that there will be no return to a hard border with Northern Ireland, has threatened to veto progress if Britain does not come up with a satisfactory and firm offer this weekend. \u201cLet me say very clearly: if the UK offer is unacceptable for Ireland, it will also be unacceptable for the EU. I realise that for some British politicians this may be hard to understand,\u201d said Tusk. It was \u201clogic\u201d that the EU would support Ireland before a member state that was leaving the bloc. \u201cThis is why the key to the UK\u2019s future lies \u2013 in some ways \u2013 in Dublin, at least as long as Brexit negotiations continue,\u201d the council president said. Speaking in Irish Gaelic, Tusk made clear that the EU stood full square behind Ireland: \u201cN\u00ed neart go cur le ch\u00e9ile\u201d [There is no strength without unity]. His words were an indication of clear and unambiguous support from the EU as Monday\u2019s deadline for an offer on the Irish border, the divorce bill and EU citizens\u2019 rights closes in, placing relations between the EU27 and the UK on a knife edge. Earlier on Friday, Ireland\u2019s deputy taoiseach and foreign minister, said he believed a Brexit deal on the Irish border question was \u201cdoable\u201d, and confirmed that his government had held talks on the subject with Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist party. Simon Coveney said a breakthrough was possible before Theresa May\u2019s crunch meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, on Monday. \u201cI think it is doable ... We are not where we need to be today, but I think it is possible to get to be where we need to be in the next few days,\u201d he said. After what some in Ireland have dubbed \u201cgunboat diplomacy\u201d by the DUP, Coveney moved to calm the storm. \u201cWe can work through this. We want to listen to unionism. They are of equal importance, but at the same time we can\u2019t allow one party to dictate what is acceptable and what is not,\u201d he said. His comments follow accusations by the DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr that Ireland had acted disgracefully in demanding Northern Ireland have separate legal status to the rest of the UK. But Coveney warned that Ireland would remain stubbornly firm on the issue of the hard border and was prepared to pull the plug on the Brexit talks. \u201cThere is not an anti-British bone in my body. Britain is a great country and we want a good deal. A good deal for Britain is a good deal for us, but Ireland will not be steamrolled on this issue,\u201d he said. EU Brexit taskforce officials have been working intensely with British officials over the past few days, but Dublin said it had not seen any wording. Varadkar said he was an optimist, adding : \u201c[We are prepared to continue] the intensive work with the taskforce that is negotiating for the EU27 to secure a positive outcome, allowing us to move on to talks about transition and the future relationship between the UK and the EU.\u201d The last-minute meeting between Tusk and Varadkar ended a week of heightened tensions between Ireland and unionists in Northern Ireland, who see the Republic\u2019s position as a threat to the UK and a step on the path to a united Ireland. On Thursday the DUP threatened to pull the plug on its \u00a31bn deal propping up the Conservatives if May offered any deal that would decouple Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Tusk said he had agreed that Varadkar would be consulted fully before the guidelines for negotiations on Brexit transition arrangements were circulated among the 27 member states before the council summit on 14 December. There, the states will decide formally whether or not the \u201csufficient progress\u201d test will be met on three issues: the financial settlement, EU citizens\u2019 rights and the Irish border."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
