England are hot favourites for victory against France, who collapsed to a humiliating defeat by Wales last Friday and have not won a Six Nations match at Twickenham since 2005. Against Wales, France raced into a 16-0 half-time lead, only to capitulate after the break, prompting Jacques Brunel to make six changes and recall Mathieu Bastareaud. \u201cThey\u2019re massive blokes and if you give them momentum they\u2019re tough to stop,\u201d said Vunipola. \u201cAs a pack we must confront the challenge of their big carriers. They\u2019ve made a few changes up front, but it\u2019s probably added more to them than taking away any of their strengths. \u201cWhat Wales showed us was how not to start a game. If you give them a leg up then they\u2019re extremely dangerous. We\u2019ve all played against French sides, once they start feeling it emotionally then they\u2019re very, very tough to stop, so we can\u2019t allow them to get into that position.\u201d While Billy Vunipola was an injury absentee during last year\u2019s competition, his brother Mako started all five matches, including the 22-16 defeat in Paris. \u201cLast year wasn\u2019t great, that\u2019s my last memory of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing because we started really well, got into the game early doors and we gave them a chance. They only need a sniff and they took over. When they get momentum they are very difficult to stop. We\u2019re under no illusions it will be a tough challenge but we\u2019re looking forward to it. \u201c[A fast start] is crucial, not just because of France but nowadays it is very difficult to wrestle momentum back. Last week was kind of a slow burner but we got off to great start with a try from Jonny. That was pleasing, but Ireland came back into it so for us the focus is get a great start and we have got to keep on top of them. The French only need one possession, a piece of magic or one split-second of a loss of concentration from us and they can score points. They are a great side and we are looking forward to what they can bring.\u201d France\u2019s second-half performance against Wales again raised questions over their fitness \u2013 often a criticism of Les Bleus \u2013 but the England attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, believes that is an outdated myth. Wisemantel has held a number of jobs in France with Clermont, Lyon and Montpellier and also expects on Sunday\u2019s opponents to play with more freedom away from home. \u201cIt was a great place to work and it gives you a really good insight into the psychology of the French. In an away game, there is an element of freedom about them. They don\u2019t feel the pressure that they do at home. If they are close on 60-65 minutes they can capitalise on any mistakes. That\u2019s the fundamental theory on away games in the Top 14 and they use that from an international perspective as well. They run on emotion and you can\u2019t let that come into the game. \u201cThe mentality has changed with the top teams where most of their players are coming from. If you look at Clermont, there is an expectation to win away from home. Toulouse \u2013 this year they have reinvigorated the way they play and the Top 14 has changed a lot this year. The French game has come a full circle with some of the better teams. \u201cWith a lot of the foreign coaches that are there, the fitness regimes aren\u2019t too bad. With Clermont they have always had force in strength and conditioning coaches so there is no sort of surprise that they are always there or there about.\u201d England v France Twickenham 3pm ITV"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
