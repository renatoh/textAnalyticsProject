Thirteen years have passed since Great Britain's double Olympic gold medallist was on the edge of his seat watching a colossal duel between Haile Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat over 10,000m at the Sydney Games, but that famous race remains a moment that has shaped his career ever since. \"I remember when I was in sixth form at school, watching the 10,000m \u2013 a big race, Ethiopia versus Kenya. As soon as the class finished we stormed out and went to the TV. I remember Haile was leading and Paul Tergat was pushing, pushing and pushing. Haile was just there and it came right to the line, we were all leaning forward and Haile stuck his chest out. \"That was one of the greatest races I've ever watched and from that point I said: 'I want to be Olympic champion.'\" Farah's heroics in London last year mean new aims and fresh goals have been set. He will stand at the start line of the Great North Run on Sunday alongside the very man who inspired him to Olympic glory in the first instance. Gebrselassie and his Ethiopian compatriot Kenenisa Bekele will go toe-to-toe with Farah over 13 miles from Newcastle to South Shields, in a half\u2011marathon meeting that has never featured such a stellar lineup in its 32-year history. The women's field is equally intriguing. Two of the greatest long-distance runners of all time, Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba and Meseret Defar, will meet in a half-marathon for the first time after an intense rivalry on the track in recent years. Farah, who will use the race as preparation for his full-distance debut in the London Marathon next year having run half of the course in April, may be the 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic champion but it is Bekele who holds the world records over both distances. At 40 Gebrselassie may not be the force of old but the Ethiopian hero is a former half-marathon record holder and won the 2010 Great North Run in a time of 59min 33sec. While Britain was celebrating Farah's double gold in a heady summer, Ethiopia was a country in despair. \"For us, the 10,000m was untouchable,\" Gebrselassie said. \"For all the Ethiopians and Kenyans it was a big shock since he [Farah] came. In Ethiopia people were not happy. Now there is a big question. People say: 'Hey, why can't you stop this guy?'\" The softly-spoken Bekele has struggled to find top form this year but his credentials speak for themselves. Three Olympic golds and five world championship titles over the 5,000m and 10,000m make him a formidable opponent for Farah, even with a niggling foot injury. When asked which of the trio would win over 10,000m at their peak, Bekele said: \"That's a very tough question. Maybe our history can explain that. \"I would think I'm still the best. I achieved world championships, Olympics and world records over 5,000m and 10,000m.\" Farah admits it will be \"odd\" to race against his idol, but insists that any good feeling between the trio will be put aside on Sunday as he continues his transition from the track to the road. The 30-year-old will take a holiday on Richard Branson's Necker Island in the Caribbean at the end of the season but before then he intends to win arguably the most keenly anticipated half-marathon in recent memory. \"It will be nice to have the three of us, Haile who has been dominating since the Sydney Olympics, then you have Kenenisa at Beijing and then me at London,\" he said. \"As an athlete, sometimes in your head you need a new challenge. Sometimes when you have a feeling you want to go with that feeling because that's what drives you as an athlete. I believe I have done good things on the track, now it's what can I do on the road.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
