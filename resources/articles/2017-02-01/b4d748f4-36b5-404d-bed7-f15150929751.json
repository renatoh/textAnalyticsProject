Early-season games are so often decided by resilience and defensive efforts and, to that end, this was a heartening night\u2019s work for two teams who will both have Grand Final aspirations after trophyless campaigns last year. Yes, there is work to be done with ball in hand for both \u2013 but for any side to be on top of their attacking game in the opening month, let alone on the opening night, is nigh-on impossible. That Leeds\u2019 last two campaigns offered the complete contrast of a treble in one and a relegation battle in the other perhaps best illustrates the opening night is no yardstick to measure a side\u2019s hopes. But, right now, that is all we have \u2013 so what did we learn about Leeds and St Helens? From Leeds\u2019 perspective, there were comforting factors even in defeat. They look far better defensively than the side who collapsed on more than one occasion last year during the defence of their Super League title. \u201cI thought it was a strong performance for the first game of the year,\u201d said the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a few objectives and staying in the game and strong defensive efforts are two of them.\u201d McDermott pointed to the kicking game of Leeds\u2019 opponents as the difference. Without the influence and guile of his captain, Danny McGuire, the Rhinos\u2019 attack did not possess enough cutting edge to secure victory \u2013 and the Saints did about enough in reply to capitalise. They too were below par in attack and devoid of a key pivot in the half-back Matty Smith, who will miss several months of the season owing to a broken leg. His replacement, Danny Richardson, showed glimpses of promise alongside Th\u00e9o Fages in the halves but this was a match in which defensive supremacy proved telling for Keiron Cunningham\u2019s men. On a number of occasions Cunningham has talked up the potential of his squad and while there is undoubted improvement to come, this was a solid, if unspectacular start, for the Saints. \u201cThe resilience of the players was second to none,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken about the unity we have and this is the best squad in terms of that. It wasn\u2019t pretty but, boy, we worked exceptionally hard.\u201d Cunningham is right. It certainly was not pretty but in terms of the spectacle expected from an opening fixture, it was far from the worst game the Super League has produced. Both sides\u2019 defensive efforts cancelled each other out in the opening quarter but, as the Saints began to turn the ball over inside their own half, Leeds eventually took advantage when Joel Moon scythed through the defence to touch down. Leeds could, and perhaps should, have extended their lead as half-time approached, but they were guilty of spurning a number of golden opportunities that came their way courtesy of more lacklustre handling from St Helens. \u201cI was a little bit disappointed with aspects of the first half,\u201d Cunningham said and it was not hard to see where he was pointing the finger. Saints\u2019 attack was noticeably off the boil in the opening 40 minutes but shortly after half-time, Fages produced an individual moment of brilliance to cut through and, amazingly, Mark Percival\u2019s conversion to make it 6-4 was the final scoring act of the match. There were brief moments of interest thereafter though. Tommy Makinson denied Liam Sutcliffe with a superb covering tackle before his opposite number, Ashton Golding, who McDermott described as \u201coutstanding\u201d, did the same soon after as the Saints broke downfield. However, St Helens ultimately held on for the two points which they would have gladly settled for before the kick-off \u2013 even if the match itself will not take up too much room on the end-of-season DVD.
