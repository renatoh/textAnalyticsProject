Now, I say, bring it on", "bodyText": "For the British teenage music\u2011lover, a summer festival is a rite of passage. I remember my first as if it were yesterday. I prepared weeks in advance, gathering intel from the wristband-flaunting older kids, and trawling internet noticeboards. I followed closely the advice to pack clothes you didn\u2019t mind getting ruined, and plenty of socks (for trench foot). I even surveyed the Cool Parent contingent \u2013 the ones who take their children to Glastonbury and say things like: \u201cI won\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t take drugs\u2019, but I will say, \u2018Stay hydrated\u2019,\u201d while winking. And my first festival delivered everything I imagined: music, adventure and friendship, with a background note of possible death. It would be the first of many, and the beginning of a lifelong love. But some years later, I detected a shift. Ticket prices shot up, headline acts smacked of nostalgia, and new music was forced on to smaller stages. People arrived in glamorous clothes, carrying coolbags filled with fancy wines. \u201cStupid 30-year-olds,\u201d I\u2019d rage. \u201cTransforming the festival, while pricing us out.\u201d I felt I was suddenly too young for these new festivals. And although my feelings changed (not least because I became that 30-year-old), I am reminded of this now, because the season is in full swing yet our usual gaggle is smaller than ever. \u201cI\u2019m too old,\u201d came the RSVPs from friends. I\u2019m told that at around my age, the feelings of being \u201ctoo young for this\u201d and \u201ctoo old for that\u201d overlap, before giving way to the latter. But where do we learn to shut ourselves out of experiences we love? I\u2019m planning to unlearn it. If my friends aren\u2019t up for it, perhaps I can dig out the email address of a Cool Parent from years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
