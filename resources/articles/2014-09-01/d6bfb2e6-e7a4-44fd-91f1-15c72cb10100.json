The 400-page report is expected to be critical of the Victorian health department and the mine\u2019s operator, GDF Suez. During hearings, the inquiry heard that the chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, had waited too long before recommending that vulnerable groups relocate and that communication to residents was confusing. Lester defended her actions, saying they were based on the best evidence available at the time. The inquiry also heard that GDF Suez was not fully prepared for a mine fire and had not adequately rehabilitated the disused area which caught alight. The blaze at the open-cut coalmine began on 9 February and burned for 45 days. There is no buffer zone between the brown coalmine and Morwell, and its 14,000 residents were blanketed with smoke, ash and at times carbon monoxide for six weeks. The inquiry, led by the former supreme court judge Bernard Teague, heard that the fire was \u201cone of the worst public health and environmental disasters in the state\u2019s history\u201d. The legal firm Maurice Blackburn has called for residents and businesses to register if they are interested in a class action, which is normally run on a no-win, no-fee basis. The firm wanted to \u201cgauge the extent to which people have been adversely affected by the fire and the amount of damage that has been suffered\u201d. A lawsuit would depend on the inquiry\u2019s findings and the community\u2019s interest. Five months after the fire was extinguished, many residents of Morwell continue to be angry at the way authorities handled the disaster in a town already disadvantaged by high unemployment and poor health. They remain concerned about ongoing health problems and fear a recurrence of a fire unless the inquiry\u2019s recommendations are implemented in full. Residents have also been largely left to bear the cost, with some still fighting insurance companies to clean roof cavities that remain covered in black dust. The blaze led to the setting up of the lobby group Voices of the Valley to fight for improved mine safety and for more diverse industry for the Latrobe valley, a major coalmining and power-generation centre. The group\u2019s president, Wendy Farmer, said the community was looking for the mine to be rehabilitated properly \u201cso we don\u2019t have to fear that this could happen again\u201d. \u201cWe want the community\u2019s health to be looked at,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we were breathing was pretty bad, and we were ignored and told that it was OK \u2026 when it wasn\u2019t OK.\u201d A new group, Latrobe Valley First, has held \u201ckitchen table\u201d meetings over the past two months to discuss the region\u2019s future with the aim of standing an independent candidate in November\u2019s state election. Tracie Lund, the coordinator of Morwell Neighbourhood House, has been nominated as a candidate for the group, which is holding interviews this week. During the fire, Lund organised a petition for a long-term study into the fire\u2019s health impact, which gathered more than 25,000 signatures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
