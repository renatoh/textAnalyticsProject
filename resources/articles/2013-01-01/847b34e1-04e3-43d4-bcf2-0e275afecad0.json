Declan Rudd had to make one very simple save, 15 minutes from time. \"Our approach is professional from the first minute to the last,\" a pleased Hughton said. Richard Rae Crystal Palace 0-0 Stoke City Michael Owen started his first game for Stoke City, and Wilfried Zaha played 55 minutes for Crystal Palace, but the striker of England's past and the hope for England's future did little to raise the level of a poor, goalless draw. Owen puffed his way through 53 minutes, as many has he had played all season before this match. Zaha, meanwhile, was substituted two minutes after the 33-year-old on an afternoon when any talk of Cup magic drifted into the south London ether. \"I wanted a win or a loss,\" Ian Holloway, the Palace manager, said. \"And I wasn't bothered which as long as we had a good performance.\" Tony Pulis said: \"We knew it was going to be a tough fixture. They're a top Championship side, it was always going to be difficult for us.\" James Riach And the rest \u25a0 Oldham Athletic produced one of the best performances of the day to win 3-2 at Nottingham Forest, to the dismay of Alex McLeish: \"We were woeful in the second half. We were sloppy in everything we did and paid the penalty for it.\" \u25a0 Only the weather could console Steve Bruce, as his Hull City side needed a 90th-minute equaliser from Nick Proschwitz to escape with a 1-1 draw at home to Leyton Orient: \"It was absolutely awful. Were there any positives? Well, it did not rain.\" \u25a0 Mason Bennett became Derby County's youngest scorer, at 16 years and 174 days, when he scored their fifth goal, three minutes from time in the 5-0 demolition of Tranmere Rovers. \u25a0 There were home wins for Aldershot Town against Rotherham United, Leicester City against Burton Albion, Blackburn Rovers against Bristol City, Barnsley against Burnley and Millwall against Preston North End. Huddersfield Town won 1-0 at Charlton Athletic and Sheffield United won 3-0 at Oxford United, and there draws for Birmingham City at Leeds United and Brentford at Southend. Only the woodwork denied MK Dons in their goalless draw at Sheffield Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
