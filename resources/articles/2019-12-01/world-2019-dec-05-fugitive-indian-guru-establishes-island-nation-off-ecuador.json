Nithyananda, who built up a huge spiritual following in India, is on the run from the Gujarat police over multiple allegations that he abducted and confined children to collect donations for his ashram and that he raped one of his disciples. While Nithyananda\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, on Wednesday he announced he was establishing the sovereign \u201cRepublic of Kailaasa\u201d, which would be the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest and purest Hindu nation\u201d. The \u201ccosmic country\u201d will reportedly be established on a private island off the coast of Ecuador, purchased by some of his wealthy devotees. Applications are open for those who want to apply for citizenship and a passport, which allows for \u201cfree entry in all 11 dimensions and 14 lokas [the 14 worlds of Hinduism] including Kailaasa\u201d. Only practising Hindus are allowed to apply for citizenship. A donation needs to be made to Kailaasa in order to be put forward for citizenship and all passport applications will be personally approved by Nithyananda. Kailaasa describes itself as \u201ca nation without borders created by dispossessed Hindus from around the world who lost the right to practice Hinduism authentically in their own countries\u201d. According to Indian media, at least \u201cthree prominent personalities\u201d from Ahmedabad, where Nithyananda\u2019s main ashram is based, already plan to relocate to the island. After publication of this article, Ecuador\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Jaime March\u00e1n Romero, wrote to the Guardian that it was \u201cabsolutely false that Nithyananda or any of his associates have or could ever have established in Ecuador a so-called \u2018cosmic republic\u2019 for their followers and supporters.\u201d Ecuador is a sovereign and independent republic and not \u201cnobody\u2019s land\u201d where any national or foreign adventurer can act outside the law, the letter said. As the founder of the Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam Trust, the guru has set up over a dozen temples and ashrams across India. But he has attracted much derision over claims of his spiritual abilities, including being able to delay the sunrise for 40 minutes, being able to see through walls, curing 82 children of blindness by \u201copening their third eye\u201d and getting cows to speak in Sanskrit and Tamil. In 2010 there was further controversy over the release of a sex tape featuring him and a female Tamil actor. Despite being a fugitive from the law for more than a year, Nithyananda has continued to broadcast live to his followers on YouTube, and it was on the platform that he declared the establishment of his new nation. It followed an address last week during which he stated: \u201cSome people against me, they are looking for me, but I am in the Himalayas, in Kailaasa.\u201d A website dedicated to Kailaasa recently appeared, declaring that the country will offer universal healthcare, free food distribution, free education and \u201crevival of a temple-based lifestyle\u201d. The site says Kailaasa also has its own cabinet, and government departments of homeland security, commerce, treasury, housing, technology and \u201cenlightened civilisation\u201d. The country also has its own flag, constitution and Hindu Investment and Reserve Bank, where cryptocurrency will reportedly be accepted as part of a \u201cDharmic economy\u201d. Last month, Gujarat police raided Nithyananda\u2019s ashram in Ahmedabad and arrested two managers. The raid followed the release of several children who had allegedly been kidnapped and locked up in the ashram. \u201cThey were verbally abused horribly, they were beaten,\u201d read a police report on the case. Nithyananda had already faced charges of raping a female disciple for five years during her stay in the ashram, under the guise of helping her spiritually, but he failed to turn up to his trial last year. In 2014, one of his followers died in mysterious circumstances in his ashram. Leaders at the ashram claimed she died from a heart attack, but the family said they suspected foul play. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 December 2019 to add a response from Ecuador\u2019s ambassador to the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
