A charity is appealing for people to \"give the gift of opportunity\": a voucher that can help a poor entrepreneur lift themselves out of poverty. The scheme has been launched by lendwithcare.org, a microfinance website set up by aid organisation Care International UK that allows Britons to lend relatively small sums to people overseas who are trying to build a better future for themselves. When you buy someone a lendwithcare voucher, they can choose an entrepreneur to lend the money to, and thereby help them transform their life. The website (which we featured in Guardian Money in August) is helping people in Cambodia, Togo, Benin, the Philippines \u2013 and now Bosnia \u2013 to start or expand their own small business. Alastair Stewart, the ITN newsreader, who is an ambassador for Care International, visited Bosnia last month as part of a trip to highlight the charity's work and publicise the voucher initiative. He met five women \u2013 two of them widows from the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 \u2013 who are using small loans to improve their lives. The veteran newsman described his visit as \"intellectually and emotionally pounding\", telling Money: \"In the context of the autumn statement, and rantings and ravings over billions of euros, how incredible it is that within a two-and-a-half-hour flight from London, there is a community for whom literally handfuls of money are transforming lives. Humbling is a pretty good word for it.\" Bosnia is in a state of what the charity describes as \"fragile peace\", held together by a combination of aid and strong diplomatic pressure. The war has left many women widowed and trying to scrape by, and Care International firmly believes \"economic empowerment\" is the key to reducing their vulnerability. Stewart says that when you are in a part of western Europe where the trains and the trams run, and there are supermarkets and shops, it is a shock to find these pockets of people, particularly around Srebrenica, \"where they've got virtually nothing\". One of those he met was Nermina. In 1995, she was sent away on a bus with her children during the Srebrenica massacre. Her husband was separated from the family and fled to the forest to escape. He was trapped and killed, leaving Nermina with three sons to raise alone. Now 51, she is working hard to support her children and has taken out three small loans to invest in small-scale agriculture. She grows vegetables in a greenhouse that she built using her first loan, and rears chickens she bought with her second. She has used a third loan to buy watermelon seeds and plans to repair her greenhouse. Stewart also met Tifa, a lawyer, and her husband Mustafa, a policeman. They are more fortunate than many \u2013 they enjoy a modest income and live on a smallholding. Microfinance has enabled them to expand, buy sheep and goats, and sell meat and wool. Stewart says he thinks Tifa and Mustafa will probably do OK \u2013 they need \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3855) \"to go to the next level\" \u2013 but for some of the others they met, it's about helping them \"stay alive\". He adds: \"That's pretty moving economics.\" On the lendwithcare website you can view the profiles of the entrepreneurs and choose who to support. These are loans, not handouts: the money you lend is paid back in instalments, typically over a period of six to 12 months. Once the loan has been repaid, you can choose to withdraw the money or recycle it into another loan. The minimum you can lend is \u00a315. This is also the minimum gift voucher amount. These can be emailed to the recipient or printed out. So far, more than 10,000 loans, totalling \u00a3343,000, have been made via the website. Four in five of the small business people are women. Lendwithcare says entrepreneurs get 100% of the loan requested \u2013 no administrative charges are deducted. The downside is that you won't earn any interest on the money you lend. In the vast majority of cases you get your money back in full and on time \u2013 in fact, lendwithcare says the \"default rate\" is currently running at an impressive 0%. Not just anyone can seek a loan via the website: the entrepreneurs will have already approached Care partner microfinance institutions (MFIs) with their business plans. If the MFI is satisfied the plan is sound, it will approve the proposal and upload the entrepreneur's profile to lendwithcare.org Stewart concludes: \"My time in Bosnia reminded me how desperately close we still are to the atrocities that swept through the Balkans. But with lendwithcare.org, there is an uplifting realisation that so much could be done for so many with so little.\" Alastair Stewart has written a blog about his visit Reach for the stars in Tanzania Want to decorate your Christmas tree with something true to the underlying festive message? Last year Guardian Money featured Shanga, an inspiring Tanzanian enterprise that employs local deaf and disabled people, and the huge response from readers has enabled it to open a UK-based website to sell its sought-after Christmas stars. All the decorations are made by 50 workers just outside Arusha in northern Tanzania. A surge of sales after our story helped Shanga take on more workers, pay its first Christmas bonus, as well as open Tanzania's first glass-blowing workshop. \"We were able to make a five-year long dream come true,\" says Saskia Rechsteiner, who founded the business. \"We imported 800kgs of bricks and insulation from Europe with the money from stars sold to Guardian readers \u2013 and since then we have been making the most amazing items. Niwaeli's husband [Niwaeli, who is profoundly deaf and mute, was Shanga's first employee], is the very first Tanzanian to blow glass, and gosh is he proud. All items are made from recycled bottles and it has helped hugely in our fight against discrimination against disabled people.\" The large Christmas stars cost \u00a32.50 and compare well with anything on the high street (trust me, I've got them). Order at kaskazi.org.uk. If you act fast, you should get them by Christmas, as stocks are held in Devon. \"We do hope your readers will be just as keen as they were last year,\" says Rechsteiner. A new chapter for a much-loved bookshop It could be the ideal Christmas gift for a book lover: the opportunity to become part-owner of a second-hand bookshop for as little as \u00a310. For 14 years, Clevedon Books, in the seaside town of Clevedon, North Somerset, was popular with locals and visitors, but when the owners semi-retired it was threatened with closure. That's when local people set up a not-for-profit \"community co-operative\", and launched a share issue aimed at raising \u00a320,000 to renovate and relaunch it. You can become a member of the co-operative, and therefore a \"co-owner\" of Clevedon Community Bookshop, by buying a minimum of 10 shares priced at \u00a31 each. More than 200 people, keen to contribute to the cultural economy of the town (whose famous literary visitors have included Tennyson, Thackeray and Coleridge) have invested at least \u00a310 each, raising more than \u00a35,000. Those behind the venture hope many more will sign up before the share offer closes on 31 December. They have also raised funds via loans and a grant. Angela Everitt, secretary of the co-operative, says: \"We've had an incredible amount of interest and support, and our members and volunteers have almost finished refurbishing the store. \"We think it's important for the character of small independent shops to be preserved and we are trying to attract a large number of investors who, as co-owners, will have a say in how the enterprise is run.\" The co-operative acquired the shop in early October and moved in a month later. They doubled the area by renting the neighbouring premises, and the new-look shop is due to open on 31 December. Its plans include ploughing profits into working with local schools, as well as regular events such as author readings, book launches, poetry sessions, creative writing groups, and book repair and renovation workshops. The share issue was launched with support from the Co-operative Enterprise Hub, which offers free advice, training and consultancy to new and existing co-operatives.
