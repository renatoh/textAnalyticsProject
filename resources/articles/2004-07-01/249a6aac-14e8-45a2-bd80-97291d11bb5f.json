Condemned as they are to wearing socks all year round (because, let's face it, not even girls Veet their feet) and given the current climate of rampant metrosexuality in which any assertion that flip-flops are effeminate would be pitifully ineffectual, these jealous little Cousin Its are now, I suspect, resorting to aiming their blows down there where it really hurts. It won't work. Flip-flops are simple, smart and sexy; terrific teamed with whatever length or style of trouser you care to sport - from poolside shorts to flared jeans - and impossible to marry with socks, thereby precluding the sartorial sin with which sandal-wearers are typically associated. In addition to the aesthetic qualities come the prophylactic ones. Flip-flops are enemies of foot odour, repellents of fungal infection, vanquishers of verrucas. What more could a boy want? I have half a dozen. With great reluctance I hibernate them come October, when I'm left to marvel at the Antipodean men who snort at the menace of gangrene and persist valiantly through British winters in their 100-odd pairs. Nothing - no funeral, court appearance or mountaineering weekend - can separate Todd from his \"thongs\". To such dedication I can but aspire. Ultimately we may come to thank those hairy-hoofed propagandists. Donning flip-flops might become seen as a thrillingly perilous pursuit, appealing only to those willing to risk penile dysfunction to look this good. \"You're so brave!\" the girls will flutter. And much like the faintly kinky, onomatopoeic slap-slap of sole on sole - I will surely love the sound of that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
