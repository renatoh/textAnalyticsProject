Sven-Goran Eriksson wants a closer look at someone hailed by Nottingham Forest's captain Des Walker as \"the defender with everything\". A day after his 19th birthday Dawson was invited to join Eriksson's squad for their get-together in Aylesbury when Tottenham's Ledley King pulled out with gastro-enteritis. There may have been a few quizzical looks when the teenager was introduced to the rest of the party but Eriksson has heard enough about the youngster to believe he could become a regular fixture. Eriksson said he had been \"hugely impressed\" by his scouting staff's report, and he has not been alone in dispatching spies to the City Ground this season. Phil Thompson, Liverpool's assistant manager, was among those watching Dawson star in Forest's 3-0 defeat of Bradford City on Saturday and a fortnight earlier Ron Yeats, G\u00e9rard Houllier's chief scout, saw him put in an equally composed display in a 3-0 win against Sheffield United. The Leeds contingent of Terry Venables and Eddie Gray have also been regular visitors on Trentside to see a 6ft 3in centre-half who is dominant in the air, faster than most defenders of his height, strong in the tackle and can bring the ball out of defence with an assurance that belies his years. \"You would have to speak to people at West Ham to see how good Rio was at the same age but I would be surprised if he was any better than Michael,\" Forest's manager Paul Hart said yesterday. \"I have not seen a better youngster than him. He can be everything he wants to be and, with a bit of luck, play for England for many, many years. I'm so pleased for him because he deserves this honour.\" Dawson, who hails from Northallerton, joined Forest's academy at the age of 13 with his brothers Kevin and Andrew. They have gone on to Chesterfield and Scunthorpe respectively but he made his first-team debut at the end of last season and signed a five-year contract in the summer. Even so it was a month into the season before he cemented a first-team place under Hart, recognised as the most prolific discoverer of talented young players in the game. \"When I watch him play I can't believe he is so young,\" said Walker, the former England international. \"I've played with some great young players but he stands out already. I'm convinced he will go right to the very top.\" Dawson won his first England Under-21 cap against Slovakia last month and had been training with David Platt's squad when he learned of his promotion. He was among the senior squad when they visited the Queen at Buckingham Palace last night. \"This experience will be something Michael can learn a lot from but he will also keep his feet on the ground,\" said Les Reed, the FA's acting technical director. \"He understands the way we are trying to bring him through.\" The issue for Forest is whether they can hold on to their most prized asset. \"His call-up can put as many noughts on his transfer value as you want but we are not selling him to anyone,\" said Hart. \"Our financial position is a lot stronger than a year or so ago. I've spoken to him about it and he is very happy with us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
