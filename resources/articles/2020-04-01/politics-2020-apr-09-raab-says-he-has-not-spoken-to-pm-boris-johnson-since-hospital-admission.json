Giving an update on Johnson\u2019s health at Thursday\u2019s coronavirus briefing, Raab said: \u201cHe is still in intensive care but he continues to make positive steps forward, and he is in good spirits.\u201d Johnson has been described as sitting up, but he has not been playing any role in government decision-making while he receives treatment at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. Asked if he had been in contact with the prime minister, Raab said: \u201cNot yet. I think it\u2019s important, particularly while he\u2019s in intensive care, to let him focus on the recovery. We in the government have this covered. \u201cI chaired the Cobra meeting that I\u2019ve just come from. We\u2019re pursuing all the different strands of our strategy to defeat the coronavirus, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get there.\u201d Johnson was taken into hospital on Sunday after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a high temperature, persisted. He was moved into intensive care on Monday evening. The government has said he has not been put on a ventilator but has continued to receive \u201cstandard oxygen treatment\u201d. Johnson tested positive for the virus on 27 March, but continued to work while isolating himself in Downing Street, including chairing meetings by video-link. The home secretary, Priti Patel, told Talk Radio on Thursday that at the virtual cabinet meeting a week ago, pictures of which were released to the media, it was evident to colleagues that he was continuing to experience symptoms. \u201cIt was clear he was unwell, and needed to get rest and recuperation,\u201d she said. Johnson tested positive on the same day as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and and the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, also announced he was experiencing symptoms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
