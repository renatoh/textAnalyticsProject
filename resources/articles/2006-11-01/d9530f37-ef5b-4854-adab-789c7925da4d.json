There are only seven weeks to go! Just seven weeks until the nation rises as one to don tinsel in its earlobes, dance to Kajagoogoo and attempt to get off with inappropriate colleagues at the Christmas party. Or maybe not: if UK workplace experts Croner are right, nine in 10 businesses are planning to ditch the annual bash due to legal worries (you know, employee gets drunk/trips over/shags person they don't fancy - then sues employer). Happily, we can all relax. According to Croner, all management has to do is set a \"party policy\". Apparently, this entails \"displaying employees' responsibilities, such as acceptable standards of behaviour, on a noticeboard\". I can see it now. There you are at the next-but-one-poshest restaurant in town. Just as you are about to pull the cracker sitting next to you your boss whips out a meetings easel and starts the brainstorm. \"There will be no alcohol, no banter and no pulling ...\" \u00b7 Of course, the worst thing about the office party is clearing up afterwards (those of you who have attempted getting ground-in sausage roll out of carpet have my sympathies). Anyway, it seems that this is not just a yearly event. Bad enough that you have to do it at home, but what with wobbly desks and changing lightbulbs it seems that we spend 32m hours a year wrestling with office DIY. According to a company called 0800handyman, we would be much better off outsourcing this work to the professionals. No surprise there, then. (Personally, I don't see it. Given the choice between 32m hours inventing outlandish ways of propping up my desk and 32m hours working on PowerPoint slides, I know which I would choose). \u00b7 If it all gets too much, you could always change jobs. According to research from Adecco, we are a nation of job flirts, always looking for new opportunities. Apparently, nearly half of us have applied for a job elsewhere or registered with a recruitment agency in the past 12 months. Whether this is because of the ground-in sausage roll or the fact that we've already snogged Tom, Dick and Martin is unclear. \u00b7 Lastly, I just wanted to get in a quick word about the Investors in People study suggesting that bosses' workplace jargon isolates staff. Guys, you've got it all wrong! Workplace jargon exists for two reasons. First, so that management consultants are not mistaken for new members of staff. And second, so that four-hour meetings are enlivened by buzzword bingo. Anyway, the real reason I bring this up is that I just wanted to pass on this gem, related by a colleague. Next time you want to say, \"I'm sending/telling the client my plan for their account\", just say, \"I'm going to open my kimono.\" Genius."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
