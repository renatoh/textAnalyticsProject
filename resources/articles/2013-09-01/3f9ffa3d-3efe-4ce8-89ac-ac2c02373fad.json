Six celebs \u2013 TV cooks, TV other-things and frankly who knows who (\"You probably know me best for \u2026 \" they introduce themselves, hopefully) \u2013 are going to learn the secrets of the beauty industry. They will do this under the watchful eye of an odd-looking man called Herbert who runs a famous salon in Liverpool. The series is called Celebrity Super Spa (Channel 5). Helen (you probably know her for having been on Coronation Street and among the witchetty grubs in the jungle) throws a strop. Two strops, actually. First, because they want her to wear trousers, as opposed to no trousers at all. Second, because she arrives a couple of hours late on set, her makeup having taken longer than expected. You'd think it would be the others who were cross with her. To be fair, they are, apart from Arg (best known for being in Towie), who wants to get inside Helen's recently and reluctantly donned trousers. But Helen is having a mighty hissy fit. Poor Helen, it's all so unfair. Anyway, it's time for our celebrities to learn something. So a lady called Tracy is here to give them a massage masterclass. The secret to massage is to do it harder and much slower than you think you should. A really great massage, says Tracy, is basically just leaning on someone slowly. Doesn't sound too difficult, does it? But things can go wrong. Like, what if a male client becomes aroused during a massage? \"Can't you just slap 'em?\" asks Rustie (best known for cooking, and laughing a lot, mainly in the 80s). No, Rustie, that's unprofessional. The correct response is to totally ignore it and carry on, says Tracy. So they get to massage people, real people, mostly not very well. Worst of all is Arg, who loses this first task and so becomes this week's salon skivvy, cleaning up while the others sip fizz. And that's it. It's back on Monday, you do not want to miss it, says presenter Laura. Hmm. You know what, Laura, you might be wrong. I'm washing (my own) hair on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
