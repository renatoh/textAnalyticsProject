He was also sophisticated, journalistically stylish, immensely erudite about jazz - and a throwback to the kind of enthusiast who made up the British jazz fan base before globetrotting tours. A discriminating record collector, from the most primitive cylinders and jumble sale 78s up to vinyl and CDs, he loved and understood the sounds they preserved, but the real point for him was the creativity of the music. The stunning 1915 Caruso recording played at his funeral was one of the jewels in a collection dominated by jazz, opera and music-hall songs. Cook won respect for everything he worked on, from the early 1980s NME - where he was a rare self-effacing staffer in a showoff era of rock writing - through the small Polygram Records jazz department, to the Wire and Jazz Review magazines. His writing was evocative, his judgments - sometimes controversial - were always humane. And then there was his eccentricity - doggedly watching Test cricket in the early-80s NME office must have taken some doing. Neil Spencer, the paper's then editor, has written that Cook \"would take on the pieces that the fashion-oriented shunned - a Roxy Music review, an audience with a fading star, a piece on the emergent sounds of Africa\". His trenchant observations and independence fuelled some memorable books. There was the tellingly titled Richard Cook's Jazz Encyclopedia (first published in 1992); his revealing story of the influential Blue Note label - enthusiasts devoting their lives to what they love best was a theme close to his heart - came out in 2001, and It's About That Time: Miles Davis On and Off Record was published in 2006. Yet his most influential legacy is the Bible-sized series of Penguin Guides to Jazz on CD (now the Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings) - that he and polymathic critic Brian Morton co-authored in eight editions across 15 years. He was born in Kew, London: his father was a teacher and record collector and his mother bred show dogs. But Cook's later interest in canines - and horses - was in the kind that ran around racetracks. Educated at Latymer school in London, he worked for the Charities Commission, and then moved to music journalism and the NME. Cook never put his ego ahead of the subject, and could bring music's elusive magic to life for his readers. His integrity and attention to detail also made him popular with interviewees. When he worked on Sounds in the late 80s, it was respect for Cook that brought U2 back into its pages, after a two-year feud. Cook edited the Wire from the mid-80s until 1993, transforming content and design, and opening out a specialised, sometimes uninviting publication to an audience drawn to classical, soul, reggae and pop as well as jazz. In 1987 he married a fellow music lover, New York expat Lee Ellen Newman and, in 1993, became head of jazz at Polygram, where he diverted the operation's resources toward neglected gems of British jazz. Cook reissued classics by the late Jamaican-born Joe Harriott and Tubby Hayes but also, as a skilful producer, encouraged new work from British players like Guy Barker. However, he was always a writer and observer first, and, books aside, he worked for the Sunday Times, Punch and the New Statesman, and broadcast on London's GLR, Jazz FM and Radio 3. In 2001 he was diagnosed with bowel and liver cancer but uncomplainingly continued to edit Jazz Review magazine during a punishing year of treatment. Cook was unconvinced by the stretching of jazz's remit to include world music, or barely improvisational dancefloor hybrids. Jazz Review concentrated on what he saw as the idiom's core values - often highlighting the singer's art. This personal conviction about jazz's fundamentals, coupled with Cook's knowledge and professionalism, brought him close to many star players. Once, in the queue for an interview with Wynton Marsalis, I was getting restive about Cook and Marsalis overstaying their slot. I entered the room as they were winding up - and impatience was immediately replaced by the sense of intruding on an intimate communion. Cook and Marsalis clearly knew that their conceptions of the beauty of jazz were uncannily similar. \"Whether one is in search of a timeless, immortal art, or the high spirits of a musician simply having fun, jazz has it both ways,\" Cook once wrote. \"I might even suggest that it is unrivalled in delivering both of these extremes within the same piece of music.\" He is survived by Lee Ellen. \u00b7 Richard Cook, music writer and critic, born February 7 1957; died August 25 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
