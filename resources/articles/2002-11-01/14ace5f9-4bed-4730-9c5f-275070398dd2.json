Don Givens, the Republic's caretaker manager, takes charge for his one and only game and insists that there is plenty to look forward to despite their current problems. Though not, apparently, the appointment of Philippe Troussier. The coach of Japan at the World Cup says he has been contacted regarding the position with Ireland but would prefer to take a similar role with the Chinese national side. The Irish are without 11 original squad members, including star names such as Robbie Keane and Damien Duff. But the side that will take the field tonight will still contain mostly Premiership players and hints that, for all their recent woes, Ireland have a pool of young talent that makes some of the recent pessimistic mutterings seem way over the top. Despite the team's absentees this evening, the back four will be made up entirely of top-flight players with Colin Healy, a highly-rated but strangely under-used member of Martin O'Neill's Celtic squad, the only unfamiliar name in midfield. Manchester City's Richard Dunne appears to be the success story of the squad, having shed nearly a stone and a half since being threatened with the sack from Manchester City after a succession of drink-related misdemeanours. His international future, Givens insists, can be every bit as rosy as that of the Irish team. \"I saw Richard at West Bromwich Albion and then watched the game against Manchester United on the television and he was excellent in both,\" he said. \"He looks in terrific condition, which was always the only problem. \"People can look at him and see that he is a very good young defender. He will play at left-back and when I told him this he was delighted, even though it is not his natural position. He is just delighted to be back.\" Another relishing the opportunity of being given a second chance at international level is John O'Shea, who has not played for his country's senior team since making his debut against Croatia in August 2001. By omitting a player in such good form from the European Championship defeats against Russia and Switzerland, McCarthy armed his detractors with more ammunition before his acrimonious departure from the job. O'Shea has been a revelation for Manchester United this season and is aware that it is a huge opportunity for those on the fringes of the senior squad. \"This is a big chance for all the young players,\" he said. \"Don is only the caretaker manager, but the public are going to see the game and see what we can do.\" Greece (4-4-2): Nikopolidis; Kyrgiakos, Patsatzoglou, Dabizas, Tsartas; Zagorakis, Basinas, Karagounis, Giannakopoulos; Haristeas, Nikolaidis Republic of Ireland (4-4-2) : Given (Newcastle); Finnan (Fulham), Cunningham (Birmingham), O'Shea (Manchester United), Dunne (Manchester City); Healy (Celtic), Holland (Ipswich), Carsley (Everton), McPhail (Leeds); Crowe (Bohemians), Doherty (Spurs)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
