Vaughan takes a couple of runs to move to 182, while Crawley ends the day on 16. It was a confident, complete knock from Vaughan - a knock that might even get the Australians worried (OK, OK, I said might). Meanwhile, where better to end a fine day's cricket than with more word-talk and a final email from Barry Glendenning. Dean Varney says: \"I believe that \"skiing\" is the only word in English that contains a double \"i\" and that \"orange\" is the only word that doesn't rhyme with any other word.\" Meanwhile Barry is continuing his spat with Angus Johnston. \"If Angus Johnston was standing at the back of an Orbital gig wearing a knotted hankie on his head, I can only conclude that he must have been working undercover for the vice squad,\" he says, clicking his fingers above his head as is his wont. \"Alternatively he was there to pick up his kids, who must have been mortified. Whether he's a policeman, an embarrassing dad or - heaven forbid - both, it's small wonder he feels the need to fabricate stories about celebrity encounters to try and convey the impression that he's actually \"hip\".\" Finally, Wayne Trotman says: \"Derrick will almost certainly be served chicken and mushroom in soya sauce.\" That's it for today. Thanks for all your emails (and sorry to Rory Batho for not mentioning his story about cleaning bowling Richie Richardson or saying hello to over-by-over regular Matthew Cobb). I'm off to the Oval to watch the match as a punter tomorrow but my colleagues Scott Murray and Dan Rookwood will be in to guide you through the day's play. All the best, Sean. 89th over: England 334-2 Sourav Ganguly's come on to try his medium pacers. The crowd are trying - unsuccessfully - to start a Mexican wave. Three runs are scored in an unthreatening over. Joshua Hardie says: \"I believe that checkbook is the longest word to display horizontal symmerty. Am I right again?\" If I had the energy, I'd type out the words big and head. Meanwhile Derrick East says: \"OK Wayne Trotman, I accept the challenge. What am I having for dinner when I get home?\" 88th over: England 332-2 Another maiden from Agarkar. Close of play is looming large now and England are keeping it tight. Time for another celebrity anecdote. \"I once saw one half of the classic comedy duo Cannon and Ball; the short 'funny' one, in a seedy Torquay hotel bar, holding court to a small group of beer swilling liggers,\" says Stephen Tappin. \"On the opposite side of the celebrity spotting spectrum, I once bothered Kate Bush as she waited outside a posh shoe shop (boyfriend inside) on Canterbury high street. She quietly signed my sketch book, and I was never quite the same again. Well I was a student at the time.\" 87th over: England 331-2 Zaheer Khan - who's been loose today - finds his line for the first time in a while and is rewarded by conceding just one run. Meanwhile Ben Shepherd is also on the defensive. \"The OED doesn't appear to have linguistical, and Merriam Webster does appear to be an American dictionary. Apart from that I couldn't possibly comment.\" 86th over: England 329-2 It's the same old story off Agarkar's first ball as Vaughan finds the boundary yet again. Another single off the end of the over moves him to 178. \"In response to Mr Glendenning - it was dark and she's not very tall,\" says a defensive-minded Angus Johnston after being accused of faking his celeb-spot. \"I was quite near the back so if your flatmate was at the front he wouldn't have seen me anyway. Besides, I might have been wringing it out when he looked in my direction, and wasn't wearing it all night.\" 85th over: England 324-2 Normal service is resumed as another Vaughan boundary takes him to 173. The Indians look completely dispirited and you can't really blame them. Incidentally, Wayne Trotman, the man who predicted a very creditable score of 365-3 at the close of play is back. \"There were no takers about my prediction, as you know,\" he says. \"Gazing into my pint glass I see England reaching 700 and India making a combined total of not more than 450. England to win early on Monday morning. Oh, and the weather will stay fine for Lee's holiday. Anything else anyone would like to know?\" 84th over: England 319-2 Who'd have believed it? A maiden over from Agarkar. I've seen it all now. Meanwhile, now that Countdown is finished, the world's wordsmiths have come to Guardian Unlimited. \"Buckfastleigh is the only place name, and probably the only word, in the English language to contain exactly half the letters of the alphabet with none of them repeated. It is in Devon,\" reckons Chris Paul. And Joshua Hardie says: \"I believe that bookkeeper is the only word in the English language with three consecutive double letters. Am I right?\" I'll be damned if I know, Joshua. 83rd over: England 317-2 A better over from Zaheer, although he's still pushing too many down legside. Meanwhile Barry Glendenning is back. Again. \"Was the Orbital extravaganza that Angus Johnston was at in Somerset House? My flatmate was at that gig and made no mention of spotting any low-rent celebrities from Big Brother. Whatever about Sunita, he'd surely have mentioned seeing some loser wearing a knotted hankie on their head . . . if they'd been there. I suspect that Angus Johnston is lying in a feeble attempt to trump my celebrity knock back by Jorja-Fox (CSI, ER and other drama series whose titles come in initial-only form), as chronicled this morning.\" Well, Angus? 82nd over: England 316-2 The hapless Agarkar is pummelled by Vaughan again. And again. Vaughan is now speeding on 167 - the second highest check-out in darts - while Crawley's on 13. \"Could you please ask Ben Shepherd why \"linguistical\" is not a word,\" asks Nathan Naylor. \"Just because he works in the House of Commons doesn't mean he can go round dictating what is and isn't a word. It also appears in the Merriam Webster dictionary... he is talking government spin sh*te.\" 81st over: England 306-2 India take the new ball and hand it to Zaheer Khan, who's reasonably tidy without threatening (unlike his new ball spells at Headingley). Vaughan is now on 163, with Crawley on eight. Meanwhile Barry Glendenning is back. \"I promise this is my last missive, but I can top Jon Boult's Neighbours story,\" he says. Well, if you must. \"An Australian acquaintance of mine named Greg Fleet appeared in Neighbours, driving the van that killed Daphne, the former prostitute who was married to jug-eared banker Des Clarke. They lived in the house on Ramsay Street currently occupied by Karl and Susan Kennedy. As an addendum, Greg told me the best joke I've ever heard: \"In Australia, kids learn in school that a shark could bite your leg off and you wouldn't even notice. Surely you'd notice after a couple of days! Especially when you keep falling off your bike.\" 80th over: England 305-2 Imperious, absolutely imperious. Two successive fours from Michael Vaughan off poor Anil Kumble take England past 300. And there goes another one like a Japanese speed-train to the boundary. That's 12 off the over. Lee Burman, who clearly has an impressive memory, says: \"Didn't some fella, between the 10th and 15th over make a prediction that 365-3 would be the score by the close? Did anyone take it up with him and can he tell me if it will rain next Saturday? Off on my holidays, you see.\" He certainly did, Lee - the biggest of beach hats off to him - if he gives us another prediction I'll let you know. 79th over: England 293-2 Another lull in the boundary-fest as Crawley watchfully plays Bangar's medium-pacers, which are reversing-swinging around quite impressively. Mike Wiper says: \"A few years ago I once saw Helena Bonham Carter in a shop in Hampstead buying a packet of ryvita type crackers (and nothing else) with a cheque. Seems a bit strange if you ask me.\" Well, the rich are different than us Mike. Meanwhile Ben Shepherd from the House of Commons says \"linguistical isn't a word\". Well, perhaps it should be... 78th over: England 291-2 Amazing - a maiden over from Kumble. Which gives us time for your celebrity stories. \"I saw Peter O'Sullivan in my local supermarket the other day,\" says Henry Spencer. \"This surprised me as (a) I thought he was dead and (b) there's a Waitrose down the road and I thought that as a horse-fancier it was against his religion to shop anywhere else. Mind you, he didn't seem too impressed by M&amp;S's range of chutneys so perhaps he'll be taking his custom there from now on.\" And there's more. \"Never mind abstemious/facetious, on a separate linguistic point I reckon \"strengths\" is the longest monosyllable in the English language; although \"Vaughan\" comes pretty close and is a fine effort considering it has three vowels in it.\" 77th over: England 291-2 Michael Vaughan brings up his 150 with successive boundaries off the hapless Agarkar. Meanwhile, as far as celebrities are concerned, we can indeed go lower. \"A mate of mine has seen Timmy Mallett in Maidenhead. Twice. One was in a bar, and he didn't have his mallett with him on either occasion. He was dead chuffed with this,\" says Anton Lawrence. Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear. 76th over: England 281-2 Harbhajan's back but that doesn't bother Crawley, whose delicate sweep brings up his first boundary of the day and takes him to seven. Michael Vaughan, meanwhile is on 145. \"Personally, I don't think you've hit rock bottom until you've mentioned ex-Neighbours actors who quit to become singers and failed miserably,\" says Jon Boult. \"Yes, I served Stefan Dennis (aka Paul Robinson) in a book shop I used to manage just off Oxford Street. Surely, that's the nadir of all Z-list celebs.\" I have to agree - unless anyone can do worse. 75th over: England 275-2 The crowd, who've now drunk one-pint too many are trying to start a Mexican wave. So far, thank God, it's failing to get off the ground. Meanwhile Crawley gets off the mark with a couple of runs. \"Did you know that the past participle of to create, if agreeing with a feminine preceding direct object or used in passive construction with a feminine subject, has three es in a row?\" says Dr Graeme Hayes. \"Cr\u00e9\u00e9e. There you are. I may need to go home, but not before telling you that that nice Edwyn Collins off the pop charts once bought me a beer, in France. A lovely man.\" 74th over: England 272-2 A wicket!!!! Butcher is out for 54 after a spinner from Harbhajan takes off, runs up his bat and floats to Dravid at slip. \"To (hopefully) clarify the facetious/abstemious debate, I think facetious is the shortest word that contains all the vowels in the correct order,\" says Chris Wilde as the mother of a linguistical row breaks out around me. 73rd over: England 272-1 Another change as Hapless Agarkar comes on and bowls a tidy over. Meanwhile Angus Johnston says: \"At an Orbital concert in June I danced next to Sunita (of Big Brother 3 walk-out fame). Would have struck up conversation if a) I'd been able to hear myself think and b) hadn't been wearing a knotted hankie on my head to keep dry as it was raining cats and dogs. Bit of a z-list celeb but it's the best I can do.\" Oh dear, I think we're reaching the end of the line of celebrity stories now. Surely they don't come much worse than that... 73rd over: England 271-1Bangar's back - but will he be able to mash England's batters (sorry?). Lots of you have now mentioned \"abstemious\" (hat's off to all of you). Meanwhile Jenny Wragge, who says some nice things about our commentary (we're blushing) wants to know \"have you been doing this all summer? And why did no one tell me?\" Yes we have Jenny, better late than never, I suppose... 72nd over: England 271-1 Delightful, absolutely delightful. Vaughan plays a textbook cover drive to head ever closer to his 150. Meanwhile, away from the cricket an intellectual battle is developing. \"What about abstemious?\" says Peter Clark (also Dr) to Dr Peter Inness's facetious point about facetious earlier. We'll be onto the intricacies of French grammar next. 71st over: England 264-1 When batting's this easy, you can't see anyone getting out. Vaughan has just lofted Kumble over long on to move onto 137. The Vaughan-Butcher partnership is now 166 runs. \"That Mark Smith of the Fall should email with Forysth spotting anecdotes is surely an example of celebrity spotting gone,\" reckons Gareth Johnson. \"Expect an email from Mr F shortly having 'spotted' the angry young man in return.\" 70th over: England 252-1 Mark Butcher finally makes his 50 after 178 minutes, 130 balls and six boundaries, and a huge beery-boozy cheer goes around the Oval. \"I see Scott Murray used the word \"facetious\" in an email earlier,\" says Dr Peter Inness. \"Did you know that facetious is the only word in the English language which contains all five vowels in the right order?\" You don't just get cricket on here, you know... 69th over: England 246-1 Kumble is trying something different now, coming round the wicket and trying to get some movement in the rough outside leg stump. He's no Shane Warne though as far as turn goes and Vaughan is able to pick yet more runs. \"I once saw Sarah Cracknell of St Etienne fame in some little club in Woolacoombe, a surf village in Devon,\" says David Monson, who seems oblivious to the fact that 99% of Britain surely knows where Woolacombe is. \"I asked her if she'd like to come to the beach with me afterwards, as I had 'some beer'. Strangely, she said no. Some rockstar she is.\" 68th over: England 240-1 There might be a mid-afternoon lull among the spectators - by now they're in the very-merry-but-not-yet-paralytic-stage - but England are ticking along nicely with another couple of singles off Harbhajan. \"Is it pitifully weak and vicarious of me to say that I (and a couple of hundred other people, admittedly) shared a plane with Bruce Forsyth recently?\" asks Mark Smith, who clearly needs to get out more. Yes it is Mark, but go ahead. \"For the record, the hair looks even more fake than it does on telly - as far as was able to make out, it's made of patent leather. He caught me gawping at it on more than one occasion, but mercifully I resisted the urge to cover my embarrassment by asking for his autograph.\" 67th over: England 238-1 Vaughan is completely dominant at the moment, even producing a shot - the on drive - rarely seen outside Ritchie Benaud's book on cricket from the 1970s to pick up another boundary. \"I once watched one of the Chuckle Brothers' (I think it was Paul) angrily insist to a small child that he was not, in fact, a Chuckle Brother and that he would not give him a f**king autograph,\" says Owen Noakes. \"I found this deeply shocking on two accounts. Firstly, why did he think anyone would believe that there happens to be another 45 year-old man with a similar spiked hair cut/moustache combination other than his brother and secondly, for god's sakes the Chuckle Brothers can't be asked for their autographs all the time can they? You'd think he'd have been glad of the attention.\" 66th over: England 232-1 Hello all. Sean Ingle here. A change in the commentary box coincides with a change in the bowling as Sachin Tendulkar comes on to twiddle his leg-spinners. God, that sentence was convuluted. Forgive me. Sachin can certainly spin it - that's not in doubt - although his lack of lack of bowling practice counts against him and he allows both Vaughan and Butcher to keep the scoring ticking over. 65th over: England 229-1 Four for Butcher off the bowling of Harbhajan. He doesn't like it, and shows his frustration with the next ball. Butch pads it back to him and has no intention of taking a run, but Harbie flings it as his head anyway and is lucky to escape a ticking off by the umpire. \"I was at a party last week, and I ended up taking a slash next to none other than Sanjay off of EastEnders a few years ago,\" says Rory Batho. \"Beat that!\" Rory, I hope you didn't! Right I'm handing over to Sean Ingle now. Back tomorrow. 64th over: England 225-1To celebrate his century, Vaughan wallops Kumble for 10 runs with consecutive fours followed by a brace. I'm going to hand back over to Sean Ingle now. So thanks for all your emails. In the words of Arnie, I'll be back. Tomorrow morning actually. Toodle pip. 63rd over: England 215-1 A single for Vaughan to take him to 99. Butcher takes a quick single to put him back on strike, and then a useless misfield gifts Virgil his fourth Test ton of the summer, and his third against India. Top bomby! 62nd over: England 212-1 Vaughan moves on to 98 with a four of Kumble. Like a pseudo-mulleted contestant with a bad accent on a bad mid-90s post-Neighbours game show hosted by Henry Kelly, I'm playing catch-up. 61st over: England 207-1 This session is barely an over old, and already I'm behind. Butcher cuts Harbie for four. Loose bowling. \"Garry \"sorry-did-I-drop-a-name-there-how-carless (sic)-of-me\" Blendingbat? Is making fun of my lack of automobile ownership the best you can do, Dan? Very poor. But the Guardian's Scott Murray is right. I should be out enjoying the sunshine, but unfortunately I'm still working on my top celebrity interview. Deadlines wait for no man.\" They do if you're on Fiver-writing duty this afternoon, evidently, eh chaps? Wouldn't happen on my watch. Overs wait for no man either, so I'd best get back to it. 60th over: England 201-1 A Kumble maiden to start off the third session. Thanks to Chris Paul for the picture caption. Thanks to Scott Murray for doing the technical bit with it. I've eaten six chocolate biscuits today. Tea: England 201-1 Sean Ingle is coming back soon, but I'm going to carry on for a bit. Lucky you, eh? Here's that picture, but I'm keeping Will Young too. Rory Batho(s) asks if I have a pseudo-mullet haircut. Yes. 59th over: England 201-1 Two more runs to Vaughan off Harbhajan bring up the 200 for England in the last over before tea. Vaughan is on 92, Butcher is on 35 and England are on the march. Carol Fullilove thinks Harbhajan is \"fab\". 58th over: England 198-1 A single from Vaughan brings up the 100 partnership. Meanwhile my computer melts down. I disappear for 10 minutes. My inbox is flooded with angry emails. I think I must have got Kali in a strop. 57th over: England 197-1 Vaughan cracks a Banger bad'un for two. He's moving solidly on towards another century. Tea is coming up. \"Kali is the goddess of destruction. Not a boy. Oh no,\" says Madhavi. Oops, have I just enraged the goddesses? Better put up that pic quick-smart to appease them then. 56th over: England 192-1 Khan to Butcher and the over of a run, a legbye and a no-ball. Three runs. England are well on top. I really want to put up a picture of some Indian gods but I don't want anyone to think I'm getting rid of Will Young's barnet for any personal reasons. 55th over: England 189-1 have any of you noticed how horribly behind I am (Harbhajan Singh to Butcher: one run)? No? Good. Daniel Hoffmann-Gill assures me that the Tourette's society of America have a marvellous site which lists all the words those with the unfortunate malaise shout. \"As for famous people, I've had a pee with Peter Shilton and Damon Albarn,\" he says, \"but not at the same time.\" 54th over: England 188-1 Good running between the wickets add two runs to the score. Khan is lucky not to concede some over-throws there. Scott Murray is using his intimate knowledge of over-by-over writers to ask: \"Dan, if you'd been up working until 3.30am and were due in again at 7pm, would you spend the precious moments away from the office out in the sunshine, or would you sit in front of a computer staring at an over-by-over cricket report, averting your gaze only to pen facetious comments about the author's (admittedly Pop Idol-esque) hairstyle?\" 53rd over: England 186-1 Four more to Butcher, who clatters Harbhajan Singh though the off to the rope. He moves on to 31. Alex Berry and Barry Glendenning have both pointed out the same thing. \"Does Joseph Hutchinson realise that Tracey Neville - sister of Gary and Phil - is a member of the England netball team? Celebrity doesn't come more A-list than that.\" And Garry \"sorry-did-I-drop-a-name-there-how-careless-of-me\" Blendingbat should know. 52nd over: England 181-1 Zaheer \"crater-maker\" Khan is back on. Butcher dispatches him nicely through mid-wicket for four. Gareth Johnson has a line to add to my little ditty about maidens before. \"And refresh this page six times and what do you get? The same page again.\" Rearrange the following words into a sentence: care; couldn't; I; less. 51st over: England 177-1 Harbhajan nearly has Vaughan lbw. Umpire Orchard isn't interested, but it's rattled Vaughan who can't bring himself to score a run off the remaining five balls of the over. \"On the subject of celebrity spotting, some friends of mine recently bought a house in Wallington, Surrey,\" writes Steve Kingdom. \"They needed to change the locks and the locksmith was none other than Grange Hill's schoolboy junkie, Zammo.\" If he'd have come to my house, I'd have just said: \"No!\" 50th over: England 177-1 Banger to Butcher. A maiden! Good, nothing to write about then. Back to the emails. Derrick East is sending in some terrible sausage jokes. 49th over: England 177-1 Like a sad bar on a lonely hearts night, there are three singles here. Barry Glendenning is back, and is using his intimate knowledge of us over-by-over writers against us once more. \"Dan, I was wondering whose hairstyle the barnet being sported by Will Young in that photo reminded of. Then it hit me like a Marcus Trescothick cover drive from square leg: yours. Are you by any chance related to the foppish crooner with many friends in the theatre world?\" Barry, I'll hit you like a Marcus Trescothick cover drive in the box in a minute. 48th over: England 174-1 Ah ha. We're back in the runs. See how Butcher plunders Banger for three! Watch as Vaughan then tonks him for four! Failing that, just read about it on some decidedly sketchy over-by-over commentary. I've lost a run somewhere, so I've just tacked it on to this Bangar over, hoping that none of you (except Banger's mum - I don't care about her) will notice. 47th over: England 166-1 Four runs off Harbhajan - three to Vaughan, who moves on to 78, and that leaves one to Butcher who now has 18. \"What you need on that there commentary site is a picture of either Hank Williams, the rather apt god of destruction Kali, or some Japanese kyudo archers. Luckily, I have all three,\" writes Dan from Truro. I knew there was something missing. Dan, I'll see what I can do. 46th over: England 162-1 A run! Off Bangar's last ball, Vaughan sneaks a single. Philip Woodger has nowt better to do than point out my spilling mistaks. 45th over: England 161-1 The Turbantor bowls a maiden. They're doing this on purpose. I mention the 'fact' (which I get horribly wrong) that there have been only two maidens bowled all day and then they bowl three in a row. Tired old sporting anology involving London buses, anyone? 44th over: England 161-1 The game has settled down a bit of late. Bangar bowls a maiden. There are maidens all over the show now, which suits me and me RSI just fine. David Halford has sent me two urls about Tourette's syndrome which have just crashed my computer when I tried them out. It's enough to make me swear uncontrollably. Ah, good-oh, Harbhajan is coming on. He's my favourite. I like his turban and cheeky smile. 43rd over: England 161-1 Lovely shot from Vaughan, that, cut away to point for four sumptuous runs. I'm getting a shed-load of emails about celebrities which I'll attend to when/if I get a spare minute. I'm also wrong about the number of maidens bowled by Kumble. He got three before lunch I'm told. I can see that my eyesight is worse than Arsene Wenger's. I'm not changing my mistake earlier though because that would be cheating, wouldn't it. I'd prefer to look like a fool. 42nd over: England 156-1 Three runs for Vaughan off Bangar played with an angled bat down to third man. Then Butcher plays, misses and gets hit on the hand as punishment. 41st over: England 152-1 Kumble is getting the hang of these maidens, so to speak (a Carry On film springs to mind). Conversely, I am quickly losing grip of both this game and my mind. And here's why. \"I always thought it was Rockwood until I had to type out this address,\" says Arnab. \"Have a completely different image of you now. Gone are the strong jaw and broad shoulders - from Robert Redford to Andy Capp in one jump!\" How is a man supposed to cope after that? 40th over: England 152-1 Butcher squeezes one Bangar run out of the over and I spend the entire over unsuccessfully trying to think of sausage gags. 39th over: England 151-1 Kumble to Vaughan. Six balls, six dots. Join them to gether and what have you got? Only the second maiden of the day, that's what. Joseph Hutchinson once knocked back some celebrities, of sorts. He was once lewdly propositioned by members of the England netball team, while working as a waiter at the British Sportswomen of the Year awards. \"They're hardly celebrities, are they,\" he concedes. No. Bangar is coming on. 38th over: England 151-1 Six runs to Vaughan. He seems to be over close call in Agarkar's last over. He drives the bowler through the covers with perfect timing. Sam Monteath wants to annoy Andrew. Tame Alien is having another go at me about being slow. Yeah, yeah. 37th over: England 144-1 Butcher and Vaughan recover from that last scare, as do I. Butcher scores two. Richard Blake has emailed in. He thinks Sean's over-by-over reports are the best thing since sliced granary and wonders if I think Will Young's a cricket fan? He then refrains from making a politically incorrect 'joke' about batting and sides. 36th over: England 142-1 Vaughany (as I like to call him) flicks one delicately down the leg side fine for four, making use of the Oval's shortest boundary. But then what is the FEC* playing at? He goes for a quick single, but Butcher, quite rightly is having none of it. So Vaughan gets a spike caught into the turf and turns and sprints back. He tries (accidentally-on-purpose?) to dive into the line of the throw from Ganguly but it evades him and had it been a direct throw, Vaughan was gone - no question. But Ratra gathers and whips the bails off. It's close, there's a lot of shouting, but the third umpire makes the correct decision. Not out. (*future England captain, of course) 35th over: England 138-1 Kumble is far less expensive, but only one bowler has bowled a maiden this morning and that is Zaheer Kahn. A single for Vaughan prevents Kumble from being the second. Vaughan survives a close call for lb. It's the fisr time he has been done all day. 34th over: England 137-1 Agarkar is having a 'Mare of Weston Super proportions. Seven runs off the over, including a four from Butcher who is getting into his stride. He tickles away the next ball for a couple more to backward square. 33rd over: England 130-1 Oops. Completely missed that over. It was bowled by Kumble. There were two runs off it. What more do you need to know? 32nd over: England 128-1 Vaughan has done it again. Off the last ball of the over, he crashes Agarkar to the boundary again to bring up what must be about his 63rd fifty of the summer. He has been the scourge of India in this series. 31st over: England 124-1 A full toss from Anil Kumble gets what it deserves and is timed beautifully by Vaughan to the boundary to move him on to 47. My colleague Michael Cooper brings me a cup of lovely-looking tea. Just right. Then Butcher gets in on the act, picking off an attempted googly and sending to the rope for his first boundary. Meanwhile, I've bunged up a picture of American Pap Idle for no reason other than it was on my desktop already so required minimal technical work. Lancashire's Neil Fairbrother has announced his retirement from first class cricket at the end of the season. In case any of you are interested. I know I couldn't give a monkey's, quite frankly. 30th over: England 115-1 Agarkar begins with a no-ball and ends with an appeal for leg before. In between a single is added. We've been looking at the craters on the strip caused by naughty Zaheer Khan's follow through (that's with his bowling not his farting). He's really tearing up the wicket which looks to have deteriorated considerably during the first morning.
