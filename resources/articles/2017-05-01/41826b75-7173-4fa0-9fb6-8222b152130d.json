But unity was the theme at a \u201cconvention\u201d on Britain\u2019s post-referendum future, with pleas for unity in the general election.Anthony Grayling, the Oxford philosopher, said it was vital that \u201cas many votes as possible are cast for anti-Brexit candidates\u201d and Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader, said politicians were \u201cduty-bound to work together\u201d. Members of the audience at Brexit and the Political Crash, organised by journalist Henry Porter and co-sponsored by the Observer, repeatedly urged speakers and panellists to unite against Brexit. \u201cFrom my point of view, this general election is irrelevant to the issue of a second referendum,\u201d Grayling said. \u201cBut it does matter that there are as many votes as possible cast for anti-Brexit candidates.\u201d There are all sorts of reasons that Theresa May called the general election, Grayling said, but \u201cthe main one is that this is the only election she can possibly win. Because by 2020, the tsunami of bad news would be so overwhelming that she would never have a chance of winning.\u201d He echoed Clegg, who began the day with a plea for a more pluralist Labour. \u201cWe are duty bound to work together,\u201d Clegg said. \u201cIt is important, under our electoral system, for Labour to learn pluralism. If it does there is hope, if it doesn\u2019t there is no hope.\u201d Clegg said that the \u201cmoneyed elite\u201d were using Brexit to advance the agenda of a \u201csmall state, off-shore, Singapore-style country\u201d. \u201cWe are now in the grip of a new Brexit elite who are operating like the new puppet masters of British politics. They are acting as a praetorian guard around the Brexit corps and Theresa May, who is their perfect prime minister.They have her exactly where they want her. And they are acting as a cabal who will kneecap any opposition and delegitimise any criticism.\u201d The 1,350 people who congregated at the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster were mostly pro-Remain, but they also heard from Michael Gove, the former justice minister, who described himself as a \u201cbig bad Brexiteer\u201d who felt he was \u201cas out of step as an Orangeman in the Vatican at a Papal mass\u201d. He said he was \u201cissuing an invitation\u201d to Remain voters to get involved in the decisions shaping the future of the UK, as it was \u201coverwhelmingly likely\u201d that Britain would leave the EU.The country would be discussing issues including migration, defence, international development, he said. \u201cIf you focus on Brexit, what you may find is that the solutions that come about do not reflect Britain in its pluralism and raucous diversity.\u201d Gove\u2019s speech was received without interruption, but his question and answer session was cut short after repeated heckling. When he made the point that few people in the room could name \u201cany of London\u2019s 10 MEPs\u201d \u2013 there are actually eight \u2013 one man asked him \u201cWho are you?\u201d Journalist and free schools advocate Toby Young had referred to the audience as \u201cbug-eyed losers\u201d beforehand, but during a panel discussion on a possible second referendum he offered them some advice. \u201cIf you think it\u2019s going to go pear-shaped, wait 10 or 15 years till things have gone completely pear-shaped, and then argue for another referendum.\u201d He said the two-year period of negotiations would not be long enough for the government to reach a trade deal. \u201cIn all likelihood, we\u2019ll have the Article 50 terms and we won\u2019t know what our future arrangements will be.\u201d Jolyon Maugham, the barrister who has been at the forefront of legal opposition to Brexit, said it was important to listen to people who voted Leave. \u201cWhat happens if the people who voted for Brexit who voted to get a better NHS, for less immigration, for greater prosperity, are not heard? What if those things they were promised do not happen? To drag people out of the EU in those circumstances isn\u2019t democracy, it\u2019s dictatorship.\u201d He said that there are major issues facing the western world and that Brexit was \u201ca distraction\u201d from these. At a morning session, the author and journalist David Goodheart said fears \u201cthat Britain will become a more nationalistic and chauvinistic country\u201d were misplaced. \u201cBrexit does allow us to press the reset button to allow us to promote an almost Danny Boyle-like benign nationalism,\u201d he said, and added that few people in the UK held racist attitudes. He was challenged by Helena Kennedy QC, who said that Brexit was being presented in an \u201cugly, hostile, xenophobic way\u201d. \u201cThere were some racist and chauvinistic people. There always are but they didn\u2019t dominate the debate,\u201d Goodheart responded. Baroness Warsi, the former foreign minister, said the way issues of refugees and migration had been raised before the referendum was toxic, citing a Barnsley man who said he had voted because \u201cI want Muslims out\u201d. \u201cThe message was, \u2018If you don\u2019t vote Brexit our women are going to be raped in the streets\u2019. It was really nasty political campaigning, and to me if you run a toxic campaign you end up with a toxic country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
