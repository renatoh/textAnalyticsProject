We will carry on the fight for clear, accurate English, including correct punctuation, grammar, spelling and word-choice. The apostrophe helps us to distinguish between the general (The ships\u2019 faults were lethal) and the specific (The ship\u2019s faults were lethal), between the plural (boys) and the possessive (boy\u2019s, boys\u2019), and can even change a noun into a verb, with a change in meaning. In the headline, Briton\u2019s battle fatigue, one Briton has tiredness from a battle. In Britons battle fatigue, more than one Briton is fighting tiredness from some cause. We need the apostrophe to tell it\u2019s (it is or it has) from its (possessive pronoun). The apostrophe is essential, easy to use and to teach. Long may it live.
