The Denmark international has not featured for Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side this term and missed the majority of pre-season with an injury that has not responded to treatment in recent weeks. Following a further visit to a specialist, the 24-year-old has been booked in for an operation next week and is expected to be absent for several months. Agger's setback represents a further headache for Ben\u00edtez, who was forced to give the 18-year-old Daniel Ayala his Premier League debut in the 4-0 defeat of Stoke City on Wednesday after losing Martin Skrtel with a hairline fracture of the jaw. The Slovakian could return for Monday's league game with Aston Villa at Anfield, however. With Agger a long-term absentee, and Sami Hyypia having departed on a free transfer to Bayer Leverkusen, Ben\u00edtez will attempt to push through a \u00a31.5m deal for the AEK Athens central defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos today, with a view to including the 30-year-old in the squad for the Villa game. The Greece international has been on Merseyside this week for a medical but the terms of the deal with AEK are still to be finalised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
