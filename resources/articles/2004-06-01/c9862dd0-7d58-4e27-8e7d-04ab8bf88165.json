Trapped within the white lines of the technical area, he could not make them hear. So he grabbed a ball boy, shouted in his ear and told him to run down the line and pass the word. Before the boy could get more than a couple of yards, the final whistle went. Portugal were through. But that was Scolari for you, in a nutshell: pragmatism and impulsiveness bursting out of a single package; imaginative and painstaking; not one to allow fate to take its course or to let protocol stand in his way; and now, after last Sunday's enthralling victory, in with a chance of becoming the first coach ever to win both the world and European titles. \"All the things that are predictable we'll take care of,\" he said at Portugal's training centre outside Lisbon yesterday, speaking of the final preparations for their quarter-final against England in the Estadio da Luz tonight. \"But football is not a predictable game. The best we can do is try to reduce the degree of uncertainty.\" This will be Scolari's third meeting with an England team managed by Sven-Goran Eriksson and the second quarter-final. The first came in Shizuoka's Ecopa Stadium two years ago, when he sent Brazil out to win a match that still burdens England's thoughts. Although Michael Owen put England ahead with an opportunistic strike in the first half, Eriksson's team were rocked just before half-time when David Beckham jumped out of a tackle, Paul Scholes made a poor challenge, Ronaldinho swept the ball away and Rivaldo equalised. England were still fretting five minutes after the interval, when Ronaldinho's 35-yard free-kick cleared the horrified David Seaman and dropped just under the bar. The subsequent dismissal of Ronaldinho drew Brazil's remaining 10 men closer together, while England - with Owen and Beckham less than fully fit - seemed to shrink from the challenge of getting back on terms with their outnumbered opponents. Long before the end they had run out of ideas, energy and willpower, leaving Eriksson to take the blame for failing to provide sufficient inspiration from the bench. Scolari's contribution went largely unnoticed. The stakes were rather lower in Faro a few months ago, when Portugal and England played out a well-mannered 1-1 draw in a fixture arranged chiefly to test one of the new stadiums built for Euro 2004. By that time Scolari had been in charge of Portugal for just over a year and, although he was experiencing problems of his own, he ran a judicious eye over the opposition, as he did again on Monday, when he joined the spectators at England's victory over Croatia. \"England were a good team in 2002, very well organised,\" he said yesterday. \"But now I think they are better. The great achievement of Sven-Goran Eriksson is that English football is not the same today as it was seven or eight years ago. They still play a lot of long balls but now they play much better with the ball on the ground. That's a change Eriksson has made and I take my hat off to him. The England team is a good example of what you can achieve if you have a project.\" Scolari knows about projects, particularly when they involve taking criticism on the way to success. Now 55, he was born and raised in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost province. It is the sort of place where a sergeant-major's moustache is a symbol of manhood. It was where he played as a defender for several small clubs before moving to the north-east and, at 34, hanging up his boots to become the coach of CSA Maceio. It is 20 years since he first ventured abroad, coaching Al Shahab of Saudi Arabia. Since then jobs in Kuwait and Japan have alternated with spells back home, during which he established his reputation by winning the Libertadores Cup with Gremio in 1995 and Palmeiras four years later. In the summer of 2001 he left Cruzeiro to rescue Brazil's rapidly foundering World Cup qualifying campaign, using unlovely tactics to achieve an aim beyond the three coaches - Wanderley Luxemburgo, Candinho and Emerson Leao. His image was that of \"Big Phil\", a rough, tough customer whose teams set out to stop their opponents playing. Nor did he court popularity by selecting famous names. But the World Cup finals proved he could mould a team capable of playing fluent, attacking football to an original pattern, and the omission of Romario was suddenly forgiven by the 180m Brazilians who had been calling for his head. Scolari's early experiences in Portugal, where he signed an 18-month contract worth about \u00a33m, were similarly bumpy. A programme of friendly matches yielded patchy performances and unspectacular results. As recently as last week, with two group matches played, this is the sort of thing he was reading in a Lisbon football column: \"How do Scolari's Portugal play? Nobody knows. They have a tactical formation and nothing else. If you're looking for the main principles of modern football, the kind of thing that Jose Mourinho has spent the last two years demonstrating with FC Porto, you won't find them in this team.\" True, a 2-1 defeat by Greece in the opening match was traumatic. But even then Scolari showed his ability to view any side he coaches as a work in progress. He withdrew Rui Costa, one of Portugal's \"golden generation\", at half-time, sent on Deco, FC Porto's naturalised Brazilian playmaker, and saw the quality improve. The next time the team appeared Deco was in the starting line-up, along with the centre-half Ricardo Carvalho, replacing Fernando Couto, the captain and another iconic figure. In a match billed by Scolari as \"a matter of life and death\", they beat Russia 2-0. For the showdown against Spain his fighting talk grew even more extravagant. \"Forgive me but I'm not talking to you,\" he told a Spanish journalist. \"This is a war, and in a war you have to kill and not die.\" This time the 19-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo started the match and the team improved its performance in every area. Carvalho and Costinha, the defensive midfield player, emerged as heroes. All-night celebrations lit up squares and main streets the length of the country as Nuno Gomes's goal gave Portugal victory over their neighbours for the first time in more than 20 years. Suddenly Scolari was being pressed to accept a two-year contract extension. \"I'm not the important thing in all this,\" he said afterwards. \"This victory is a reward for the work of the whole group, for their enthusiasm, their determination and the concentration shown by the players. In the match against Russia we took a big step. We found some solutions to our problems. Against Spain we played even better. The players showed great fighting spirit and so did the nation. I thank the people of Portugal for their support. Every time we leave our training centre for a match there are people lining the roads and 5,000 cars following us to the stadium. Our victories are also theirs.\" But they would not be happening without his attention to detail and willingness to make changes. \"If I just thought to myself, 'Well, I have good players, I'll let them go out and play,' and then they found themselves playing against good players who also have good organisation, we'd lose,\" he said yesterday. \"I have to plan how to take advantage of the quality of my players. Our fitness is good and our technical preparation is good. Now it's mostly mental preparation, which involves the results of studying our opponents very closely and passing on the details to the players. \"In tactical terms we'll have to make one or two adjustments because England's system is different from Spain's. In terms of quality they're similar. But we'll have to adjust the balance between the defence and the midfield. Probably we'll make one positional change. I don't know what it will be yet because we haven't done the final study.\" Wayne Rooney, of course, looms large in his thoughts. \"We have to study very closely what Rooney does so that we can stop him scoring. He is in very good form. We won't be telling a player to mark him specifically. That's difficult to do and we'll need another way to stop him. If we give him the chance, he'll score. But he doesn't win matches on his own. I've noticed that Beckham and Owen are playing for the team. They're not thinking about themselves. That makes them very valuable. And I've also noticed that, although England's strikers are quite small, they still score lots of goals with headers. They're very intelligent and they know how to make runs into the area, especially Scholes, who is always finding space.\" He was playing down the belligerence yesterday but he expressed his respect for England's heavy artillery, particularly their free-kicks and the long-range shooting of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. \"To stop them,\" he said, \"we'll probably have to push our players a bit further up the field. If we do that, we run the risk of letting them get in behind us. But, if we have to take risks, so be it. It's football. And we have to concentrate more on scoring goals ourselves. If you try to control the game without thinking all the time about scoring, you'll never win.\" Might he draft in a third centre-back, replicating the formula he used so successfully to win the World Cup? \"At this point, no. But, if we lose the match, I'll strangle myself. And after that I'll think about what I should have done.\" A few facts about Big Phil French connection Big Phil Scolari's other nickname is Popeye, for his resemblance to the detective played by Gene Hackman in The French Connection. Cosmic foresight While training for the World Cup, Scolari sent off his captain Emerson so that the team could practise playing when down to 10 men. Eerily Ronaldinho was then red-carded in the quarter-final as Brazil beat England 2-1. Staying alive To relax before big games, Scolari has confessed to listening to the Bee Gees. Dirt tracker Scolari was a modest defender, turning out for Aymore, Caxias, Novo Hamburgo, Juventude and CSA. He was never picked for his country. Forest fire Scolari, an admirer of English football, has admitted to falling in love with Brian Clough's European Cup-winning Nottingham Forest side. And also, arguably, Clough's big mouth. Big mouth In a match against Paraguay in 2001 Scolari was sent off for abusing a linesman. He duly went off and hid from the officials on the stairs while his assistant, Flavio Murtosa, took over. Murtosa was then dismissed for dissent. Both remained on the stairs until the match finished 3-1 to Brazil. Official disapproval Fifa's website once criticised Brazil's \"bullyboy football\". It said: \"Scolari encouraged his players to foul the opposition and criticised them for not doing enough time-wasting.\" How the teams compare Portugal Ricardo 6 The Sporting Lisbon No1 has grown in assurance since succeeding Vitor Baia, doubtless buoyed by a very public vote of confidence granted by Scolari. Miguel 6 Miguel will provide a potent source of support for Figo and Ronaldo as they look to exploit England's left flank, but could be vulnerable defensively. Jorge Andrade 7 Andrade was immense against Spain, withstanding a bullocking performance from Fernando Torres. Faces a different challenge in Owen and Rooney. Ricardo Carvalho 6 Shares with Andrade the problem of how to counter the threat from England's boy wonder. To stick or twist as Rooney drops deep is the question. Nuno Valente 6 A member of Jose Mourinho's Porto side, he made his debut against England in 2002 and subdued Spain's dangerous winger Joaqu\u00edn effectively on Sunday. Costinha 8 An outstanding holding midfielder, Costinha is perhaps the key to keeping Rooney quiet. Was fantastic against Spain and he will be crucial to the outcome. Maniche 7 Disappointing against Greece, electric against Russia and Spain, Maniche is the legs of the Portuguese midfield who is also capable of scoring important goals. Luis Figo 7 Slowly shedding the torpor that has affected several of Real Madrid's galacticos here. Tortured the Spanish full-backs and is expected to do the same to Cole and Neville. Deco 8 The erstwhile Brazilian makes Portugal tick. Plays in the No20 shirt but, Zidane apart, he is the closest to a traditional No 10 in the tournament. Cristiano Ronaldo 8 From show-pony to thoroughbred in a fortnight. A little tippy-tappy for some, but the step-over king has been princely here and may reign over Gary Neville. Nuno Gomes 7 The winner against Spain was the latest in a line of important goals for Spain. Quick, sharp and confident, Portugal's sole striker will require careful attention. Total 76 England David James 5 His shot-stopping has never been in doubt but his inability to dominate the six-yard box, never mind the penalty area, has been a liability here. Gary Neville 7 Quiet and consistent. Faces his toughest examination yet against Ronaldo and Luis Figo, who will switch wings in search of openings. Sol Campbell 8 Surely the best stopper in the world game but, as the senior partner, he needs to take responsibility for England's defensive frailty at set pieces. John Terry 8 It is to Terry's credit that Rio Ferdinand has barely been mentioned in the run-up to the tournament, but needs to rediscover his Champions League form for England. Ashley Cole 7 Asked to defend the left flank almost single-handed and offer width, he has been outstanding so far. Portugal's wingers will pose a huge test tonight, however. David Beckham 8 Is capable of so much more than we have seen so far. But even at 75% he is crucial, and if he gets back to something close to top form England can step up another gear. Frank Lampard 8 Hard to argue with his contribution since displacing Nicky Butt. Goals, tackles, astute passing and his athleticism make him a crucial player tonight. Steven Gerrard 7 Often appears as if he wants to do everything, and tonight he may have to. Deco, Ronaldo and Figo must be stifled at source and Maniche will need watching. Paul Scholes 7 Freed from left-side responsibility as the diamond re-emerged against Croatia and crucial to England's attack. Unlikely to be given similar latitude tonight. Wayne Rooney 9 Whether he's the new Pele or a brilliant Boy Wonder has looked terrifyingly good, prompting Portugal's coach Scolari to rejig his tactics to deal with him. Michael Owen 6 Out of touch and luck, he has turned provider in the past fortnight. It is hard to imagine, however, that Owen will go through the tournament without notching.
