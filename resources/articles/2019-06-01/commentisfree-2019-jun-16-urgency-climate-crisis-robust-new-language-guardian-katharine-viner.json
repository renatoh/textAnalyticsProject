The announcement by editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, of five changes to the style guide generated reaction in media and science. For each change (in bold below) I asked Viner for her reasons, which follow here in italics. She began by reiterating that \u201cnone of the old terms is banned. If in a particular circumstance the original term is clearly more appropriate, then it should be used. But the preference is for the new terms.\u201d Use climate emergency, crisis or breakdown instead of climate change Huge-scale and immediate action is needed to slash emissions but they are still going up \u2013 that\u2019s an emergency or crisis. Extreme weather is increasing and climate patterns established for millennia are changing \u2013 hence breakdown. Use global heating instead of global warming Global heating is more scientifically accurate \u2026 Greenhouse gases form an atmospheric blanket that stops the sun\u2019s heat escaping back to space. Use wildlife instead of biodiversity Biodiversity is not a common or well understood term, and is a bit clinical when you are talking about all the creatures that share our planet. Use fish populations instead of fish stocks This change emphasises that fish do not exist solely to be harvested by humans \u2013 they play a vital role in the natural health of the oceans. Use climate science denier or climate denier instead of climate sceptic Very few experts are, in good faith, truly sceptical of climate science, or of the necessity for strong climate action. Those arguing against it are denying the overwhelming evidence that the climate crisis exists. Readers took the discussion further, and I put some of their suggestions (bold) to Viner for her responses (italics). \u201cWildlife\u201d is insufficient to describe \u201cbiodiversity\u201d A reasonable argument \u2026 biodiversity is not banned, if it\u2019s clearly the best term, then use it \u2026 wildlife is a much more accessible word and is fair to use in many stories. \u201cCarbon emissions\u201d should be \u201ccarbon dioxide emissions\u201d \u201cCarbon dioxide emissions\u201d is technically correct, but a commonly used shorthand, \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions\u201d, is even better if we\u2019re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere, ie including methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs etc. Consider \u201cclimate instability\u201d instead of \u201cclimate heating\u201d \u201cGlobal heating\u201dand \u201cclimate breakdown\u201d serve the same purpose as \u201cclimate instability\u201d. Not heating, overheating \u201cOverheating\u201d implies a judgment about how much is too much. I think that judgment is captured by \u201cclimate crisis, emergency, breakdown\u201d. I support Viner\u2019s direction of travel. She is harnessing the power of language usage to focus minds on an urgent global issue. One challenge for the Guardian and the Observer will be to weigh, in specific journalistic contexts, two sometimes competing aspects of terminology used in public debates: language as description, and language as exhortation. \u2022 Paul Chadwick is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
