Chernobyl and Three Mile Island cast long shadows over the debate, as do the leakages and pollution from Sizewell B. Nuclear energy may seem cheap, modern and offer escape from dependence on fossil fuels (and their negative environmental and geopolitical impacts), but one mistake and the consequences could be fatal. Include the costs of decommissioning nuclear power stations at the end of their life and on some assumptions (though not all), nuclear energy moves from being cheap to expensive. Which is why the Prime Minister and the government must handle the approaching debate about Britain's energy options with care and transparency. In his speech during the CBI dinner last week, Tony Blair let it be known that he had seen a first draft of the DTI review; the case for nuclear power was 'back on the agenda with a vengeance,' he said. As he knew would be the case, he was reported as backing renewal of Britain's soon-to-be-decommissioned nuclear power stations. The country desperately needs an informed and wide-ranging debate on this issue and it would have been prudent for the Prime Minister to have waited for publication of the review before rushing to judgment. Jonathon Porritt, the chairman of the Sustainable Development Commission, was right to say that the government would damage its credibility if it pre-empted the conclusions of its own energy review with 'premature and insufficiently considered announcements'. This is an argument about risk and reward, where small changes in core assumptions can transform the outcome of debates. For example, by 2020, the Middle East will supply the world with 80 per cent of its oil. How worrying is that dependence? Then there is climate change. Renewable energy and nuclear power both generate negligible carbon, though renewables provoke less antagonism. But can they realistically plug the gap? Finally, projected costs can be massaged to make one or other option look more attractive. Both advocates and opponents of nuclear power are guilty of making assumptions to support their case. But this argument is too important for sleights of hand. The only resolution will be through transparency. Mr Blair has started on the wrong foot. This argument deserves nothing less than utter honesty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
