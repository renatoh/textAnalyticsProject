So when he says humanity's \"gigantic uncontrolled experiment on the earth\" will be seen as a more important aspect of 20th-century history than communism, democracy and the second world war, you take him seriously. Exhilarating sweeps across the decades are skilfully combined with specific case studies and heroes and villains: US chemist Thomas Midgley, for example, is named as having more atmospheric impact \"than any other organism in earth history\" for coming up with the double-whammy of chlorofluorocarbons and lead in car engines. Football Against the Enemy Simon Kuper (Phoenix, \u00a37.99) Researching this 1994 study of football's cultural and political influence took the then 23-year-old author to 22 countries, from Estonia to Cameroon, Ukraine to Argentina. Now reissued, it stands up stunningly well: Kuper's engaging youthful excitement about meeting star players and managers coexists with a mature, energetic intelligence as he traces the game's interpenetration with national histories and mores. Every chapter enthrals, but eastern Europe throws up the most arresting interviews, notably with a \"football dissident\" from East Berlin who travelled around the Soviet bloc before the Wall fell to cheer on western teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
