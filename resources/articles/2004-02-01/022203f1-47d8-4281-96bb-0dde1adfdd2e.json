The news ends weeks of rumours linking the 21-year-old international with a switch to Claudio Ranieri's multi-million pound squad. A statement released by the Brittany-based club today said, \"Petr Cech's transfer was signed on Monday between Rennes and Chelsea. The Czech international will leave Brittany at the end of the season.\" The French outfit did not reveal details of Cech's fee, but it was recently reported that Chelsea offered \u00a38.9million to secure the player on a five-year contract. Cech, who was contracted to Rennes until 2006, has won 15 international caps and is expected to be the Czech Republic's first-choice goalkeeper at Euro 2004. The former Sparta Prague player's transfer will fuel rumours that the current Chelsea number one Carlo Cudicini wants to return to Italy at the end of the season. Rennes turned down an initial bid from Chelsea last month. Cech said at the time, \"I said I was interested, while insisting it would depend on Rennes' attitude. But if all this stops now I would be disappointed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
