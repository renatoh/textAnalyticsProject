As Fox News announced more state-level victories for Joe Biden on Wednesday, Trump supporters across the country grew more vocal in their frustration with the network. Some say they have shifted their allegiance to media outlets that lean even further right, such as One America News, which employs a prominent conspiracy theorist as one of its correspondents. In Arizona, pro-Trump demonstrators who massed outside an election facility in Phoenix chanted: \u201cFox News sucks!\u201d A man in Nevada screamed the same slogan repeatedly in the background of a live news feed there. In Detroit, as Trump supporters chanted \u201cStop the count\u201d outside a ballot-counting location, the news that Fox had just called Michigan for Biden had little effect on the demonstration. \u201cFox, you can\u2019t even trust them,\u201d said Rob Phail, 51, from South Lyon, Michigan, who had been leading the \u201cstop the count\u201d chants. \u201cThey\u2019re the worst chameleons of all. So you\u2019re like, OK, who do you trust?\u201d Asked whom he would trust to confirm the actual results of the election, he said: \u201cTrump.\u201d On Facebook, on a now-deleted group for Trump supporters that claimed Democrats were trying to steal the election, dozens of commenters described how \u201ctotally betrayed\u201d they felt while watching Fox News on election night. \u201cWhen CNN appeared more pro-Trump, I was concerned,\u201d one person wrote. Others said they felt Fox was \u201cturning on\u201d the president and said that they believed several Fox reporters had gone \u201cfull lefty\u201d. On Twitter, some Trump supporters were starting to label Fox News as \u201cfake news\u201d. Trump supporters\u2019 frustration with Fox was building before the network\u2019s election calls for Biden this week. The rightwing network, owned by Rupert Murdoch and built up by the late Roger Ailes, was once so closely aligned with Trump that many observers said it functioned as \u201cstate media\u201d. Reporters chronicled how political talking points aired by Fox News hosts were picked up by the president, and then were reinforced again on the news network. Trump himself has turned up his criticism of the network, railing against its decisions and some of its anchors for months. His supporters appeared to have moved with him. During the first presidential debate in September, moderated by the Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, many Trump supporters said they believed Wallace was biased against the president. On election day, Fox made an early call that Joe Biden had won Arizona, a decision that reportedly infuriated the Trump administration and helped shift the broader public narrative of the election result towards a likely Biden victory. Now, some Trump supporters say they have shifted their allegiance to smaller, even more vehemently pro-Trump media outlets, such as Newsmax or One America News. OAN has spread multiple conspiracy theories, including amplifying baseless claims about a 75-year-old protester shoved by the police during demonstrations over police brutality this summer. As Trump has feuded with Fox, he has lavished more praise on OAN, tweeting last year that it \u201cis doing incredible reporting\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
