At a speech in Wakefield on Thursday, the Labour leader is to argue that if May is unable to get her flagship piece of legislation past MPs next week then her government will have lost all authority, meaning an election is urgently needed. \u201cSo I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide,\u201d he will say, according to extracts from the speech released in advance. \u201cTo break the deadlock an election is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option. It would give the winning party a renewed mandate to negotiate a better deal for Britain and secure support for it in parliament and across the country.\u201d Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit is to first of all seek a general election, and only if that does not happen to consider the idea of a second referendum, a stance which has prompted some pressure from a membership predominantly keener on another referendum. The party has also avoided specifics on when it might push for an election, something it could force under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by winning a specifically worded motion of no confidence in the government. On Wednesday, two of Corbyn\u2019s frontbenchers indicated this moment could come very soon after what Labour hopes will be defeat for the government when the delayed vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal finally happens next Tuesday. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cObviously, the next thing to do immediately after that is for there to be a vote of confidence in the government.\u201d Speaking later on Sky News, Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, confirmed the plan. Asked if this meant a confidence vote would come \u201cnext week, basically\u201d if May lost the vote. Gwynne replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d According to the extracts of his speech, Corbyn will say Labour will vote against the \u201cbad deal\u201d proposed by the prime minister. \u201cIf the government cannot pass its most important legislation, then there must be a general election at the earliest opportunity,\u201d he will say. \u201cA government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.\u201d On the wider issue of national divisions, Corbyn is to argue that Brexit is more of a symbol than a cause of splits. \u201cThe real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave. It is between the many, who do the work, create the wealth and pay taxes, and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in Tottenham, you may well have voted to remain. You\u2019ve got high bills, rising debts, you\u2019re in insecure work, you struggle to make your wages stretch, and you may be on universal credit and accessing food banks. You\u2019re up against it. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in Mansfield, you are likely to have voted to leave. You\u2019ve got high bills, rising debts, you\u2019re in insecure work, you struggle to make your wages stretch, and you may be on universal credit and accessing food banks. You\u2019re up against it.\u201d While some people saw the EU as \u201cpart of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility\u201d, the real issue was a wider system which entrenched the power of an elite, he will say. During the first prime minister\u2019s questions of 2019 on Wednesday, Corbyn mocked May over what he said was her failure to get any further assurances from EU leaders to placate Tory MPs or her Democratic Unionist party partners since pulling the vote planned for December. \u201cIsn\u2019t the PM bringing back exactly the same deal she admitted would be defeated four weeks ago?\u201d he asked, saying the prime minister was offering only \u201cwindow dressing\u201d. Twice he asked May if she would discount the idea of no deal, especially after MPs backed an amendment to the finance bill from Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper to curb some of the government\u2019s tax administration powers in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU. May responded by saying Corbyn was himself ruling out the only deal acceptable to Brussels. \u201cThe only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
