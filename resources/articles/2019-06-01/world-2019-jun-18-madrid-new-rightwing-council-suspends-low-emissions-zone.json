The plan, known as Madrid Central, covers 472 hectares (1,166 acres) and was intended to cut nitrogen dioxide levels and put people at the centre of the city\u2019s transport thinking. It was one of the most high-profile policies of the capital\u2019s previous mayor, the leftwing former judge Manuela Carmena, and has proved popular with residents, visitors and environmental groups. But the scheme has been attacked by the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), which now runs Madrid after agreeing a deal with the centre-right Citizens party and securing the backing of the far-right Vox party. The new PP mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, has made good on his threat to \u201caddress\u201d the issue of Madrid Central. From 1 July, the city council will no longer fine people for taking more polluting vehicles into the zone. However, it said the suspension was only temporary and could be reversed. The environmental group Ecologists in Action said Madrid Central had already brought about record reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels, with pollution from the gas 48% lower in April 2019 than during the same month last year. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that it\u2019s reducing pollution and has been adopted very willingly by people,\u201d said the group\u2019s co-ordinator, Paco Segura. \u201cA lot of organisations and social collectives are mobilising because people are beginning to wake up to the advantages of having fewer cars.\u201d Segura said protests would be held over the coming days to stop the council abandoning the scheme and make Madrid the first European city to scrap a major urban low-emissions zone. \u201cThis is stubbornness on the part of the city council, which said it would take action on this despite the fact that it flies in the face of all logic and common sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a case of pure party politics being placed before people\u2019s health.\u201d The move has also been questioned by Mart\u00ednez-Almeida\u2019s deputy, Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds of the Citizens party. She acknowledged the PP and Vox wanted to scrap Madrid Central but counselled against such drastic action. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to simply change everything back to how it was,\u201d she told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo earlier this week. \u201cNow it\u2019s up and running, we know which bits of it work and which don\u2019t, so we can listen to people and adapt it as needs be. But I don\u2019t think a total reversal is the option.\u201d Spain\u2019s increasingly fragmented politics is leading parties into awkward and potentially unstable coalitions across the country. On Monday, Citizens parted company with the former French prime minister Manuel Valls, whom it had backed to oust Ada Colau as mayor of Barcelona. Although Valls threw his weight behind a coalition between Colau\u2019s far-left grouping and the Catalan Socialist party \u2013 thus stopping the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left from taking over city hall \u2013 he has been a fierce critic of Citizens\u2019 decision to work with Vox. Tensions between Valls and the party\u2019s leadership have been tense since they disregarded his calls for a cordon sanitaire against the far-right and instead sought Vox\u2019s backing to govern the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda in coalition with the PP."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
