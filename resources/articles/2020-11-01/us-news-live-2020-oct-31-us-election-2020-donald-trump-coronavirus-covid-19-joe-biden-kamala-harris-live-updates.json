Here\u2019s what happened today: Obama lends a hand as Biden and Trump launch final campaign blitz. America was on edge on Saturday as the candidates launched a final campaign blitz amid a surging pandemic, record early voting and gnawing uncertainty over when the outcome of the presidential election will be known US sets world record for coronavirus cases in 24 hours. Daily caseload of 100,233 surpasses tally set in India last month Early voting surges in Texas. In a stunning display of enthusiasm, more than 9.6m Texans have voted ahead of election day, surpassing the total number of votes cast four years ago. Texas Democrats cancel event after campaign bus followed. Texas Democrats said they cancelled a campaign event for \u201cpublic safety and security reasons\u201d, after a group of Trump supporters driving trucks followed a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a highway outside of Austin. Thousands of Donald Trump supporters appear to have been left out in the cold following his rally outside Pittsburgh tonight, according to CNN. CNN\u2019s DJ Judd shared a photo from outside Trump\u2019s rally in Butler showing hordes of rallygoers waiting in near-freezing temperatures for shuttles to take them back to the designated parking areas. Judd said the temperature outside the venue at the time of his photos was 41F (5C). It\u2019s the second time in four days that transportation snarls have left Trump rally attendees stranded after an event. On Tuesday, seven people were hospitalized after supporters at a late-night Trump rally at an Omaha airport remained at the site waiting on buses hours after Trump\u2019s plane had departed. The problem was blamed on limited traffic flow on the two-lane road that led to the site of the rally. The Washington Post reported that Trump supporters were stuck after the president spoke at Omaha\u2019s Eppley Airfield. It said many elderly supporters of Trump were among those stranded. Omaha police said in a written statement that first responders dealt with 30 people for medical reasons throughout the day and seven were sent to hospital. At the rally, Trump said he\u2019s issued a memorandum that calls on government agencies to determine fracking\u2019s impact on the economy and trade and the costs of banning the oil and gas extraction through fracking. The president has repeatedly charged that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support restrictions on the industry. \u201cIn other words, if one of these maniacs come along and they say we\u2019re gonna end fracking we\u2019re gonna destroy the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\u201d Trump said in announcing his memorandum during his remarks. \u201cYou can say \u2018sorry about that.\u201d\u2019 Barack Obama briefly showed off his silky left-handed shooting stroke at Flint Northwestern High School where he spoke at a drive-in rally with Joe Biden earlier today. The clip of the impromptu three-pointer has gone viral in the hours since Saturday\u2019s rally, garnering praise from no less than LeBron James. \u201cNow you just showing out now my friend!!\u201d the recently minted NBA finals Most Valuable Player tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do huh?? Ok ok I see. All cash!\u201d A federal judge has ordered the US Postal Service to take \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to deliver ballots in time to be counted in Wisconsin and around Detroit, including using a priority mail service. The Associated Press reports: Chief US district judge Stanley Bastian in Yakima, Washington, issued the order on Friday after being presented with data showing on-time delivery of ballots sent by voters was too slow in Michigan and Wisconsin. They are both \u201cbattleground states\u201d in the November election. Delivery of ballots in the USPS\u2019 Detroit district, for example, has dipped as low as 57% over the past week, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson\u2019s office said Saturday. \u201cEvery vote must be counted,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cOur democracy depends on it.\u201d National on-time delivery has been at 93% or higher, said the statement from Ferguson, who leads a coalition of 14 states that filed a lawsuit on 18 August over changes to the Postal Service. Bastian, an appointee of former US president Barack Obama, said that starting Sunday and continuing through 10 November, the USPS must report to his court the prior day\u2019s \u201call clear\u201d status for each facility and processing center in the Detroit area and a district covering most of Wisconsin. If the USPS identifies any incoming ballots in its \u201call clear\u201d sweeps of these facilities, it must make every effort to deliver those ballots by 8pm local time on Election Day, including by using Priority Mail Express or other extraordinary measures, Bastian said. Priority Mail Express is an overnight service that costs a minimum of $26.35 per envelope, according to the USPS.com website. Asked for comment on the judge\u2019s order, Postal Service spokesman Dave Partenheimer referred to a fact sheet posted Saturday that says as of Friday, Postal Service employees are authorized to use the Express Mail network to speed completed ballots to their intended destinations. \u201cWe take our legal obligations very seriously and (are) complying with all court orders,\u201d Partenheimer said. \u201cThe Postal Service continues to implement extraordinary measures across the country to advance and expedite the delivery of the nation\u2019s ballots.\u201d They include extra pick-ups, extra deliveries, and collecting mail on Sunday, Partenheimer said. A federal judge in Texas scheduled an emergency hearing for Monday on whether Houston officials unlawfully allowed drive-through voting and should toss more than 100,000 votes in the Democratic-leaning area, Reuters reports. US district judge Andrew Hanen in Houston on Friday agreed to hear arguments by a Republican state legislator and others that votes already cast at drive-through voting sites in the Houston area should be rejected. More from Reuters: The lawsuit was brought on Wednesday by plaintiffs including Steve Hotze, a conservative activist, and state representative Steve Toth. They accused Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins, a Democrat, of exceeding his constitutional authority by allowing drive-through voting as an alternative to walk-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Harris County, home to about 4.7 million people, is the third most populous county in the United States. It currently has 10 drive-through polling sites, which are available to all voters. The lawsuit came after the Texas Supreme Court, one of the most conservative state courts in the United States, rejected similar bids to halt drive-through voting in Harris County. The plaintiffs ask the court to \u201creject any votes it finds were cast in violation of the Texas Election Code\u201d and \u201crequir all memory cards from the 10 drive-thru voting locations be secured and not entered or downloaded into the Tally machine until this Court issues an order on this Complaint.\u201d Hanen was appointed by President George W. Bush, a Republican. The request is \u201cwholly unreasonable,\u201d Democratic groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said on Friday in a motion asking to intervene in the case. \u201cPlaintiffs ask this Court to throw Texas*s election into chaos by invalidating the votes of more than 100,000 eligible Texas voters who cast their ballots at drive-thru voting locations at the invitation of county officials and in reliance on the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow drive-thru voting to proceed,\u201d the groups said. Donald Trump was greeted by former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz on the tarmac after Air Force One touched down at Pittsburgh International Airport, where he\u2019s traveled for his third of four rallies today in the crucially important battleground state of Pennsylvania. \u201cLou Holtz is a friend of mine and it\u2019s so nice for him to be here,\u201d Trump said during a brief gaggle with reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the presidential medal of freedom. He\u2019s a very inspiring guy.\u201d He added: \u201cI hear we\u2019re doing great in Florida, great in Ohio. Doing really well in Florida, doing great in Texas. ... Iowa\u2019s doing really great. We\u2019re going tomorrow but we\u2019re doing really good.\u201d Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, about 35 miles north of Pittsburgh, is expected to begin shortly. Stevie Wonder was back in his home state on Saturday performing at a get-out-the-vote event for Joe Biden in Detroit. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re gonna win this fight, a fight against injustice, is by voting,\u201d the Saginaw native told a crowd at the drive-in rally. \u201cWe must vote justice in and injustice out.\u201d Wonder, who stumped for both Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, was warming up the crowd before scheduled remarks by Obama and Biden, their second joint campaign stop of the day in the battleground state oof Michigan. At one point he admonished the crowd for not adhering to social distancing guidelines while taking a swipe at Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI know you\u2019re having a good time but I want y\u2019all to social distance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen y\u2019all get to close, come on. Don\u2019t do all that. We\u2019ve got a situation going on cause somebody didn\u2019t handle their business right.\u201d The 25-time Grammy winner also joked about Trump\u2019s debate comments telling the far-right Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d \u201cYou know what we say in the ghetto when somebody says that, right?\u201d he asked the crowd, adding, \u201cwatch yourself, get your ass whipped.\u201d Amid rising partisan tension in the United States, at least 11 Americans have been killed while participating in political demonstrations since May this year, according to new data from a non-profit monitoring political unrest in the United States. Nine of the people killed during protests were demonstrators taking part in Black Lives Matter protests. Two were conservatives killed after pro-Trump \u201cpatriot rallies\u201d. All but one were killed by fellow citizens, and most of them were shot to death. Another 14 Americans have died in other incidents linked to unrest this summer, including two law enforcement officers allegedly killed by an anti-government \u201cBoogaloo\u201d extremist, who deliberately targeted federal law enforcement during a protest against police violence. A get-out-the vote rally in the battleground state of North Carolina on Saturday ended with police using pepper spray on some participants and making several arrests. Multiple people were arrested outside Alamance county\u2019s courthouse and police used pepper spray to disperse a crowd which including a five-year-old girl and other children, according to the Raleigh News &amp; Observer: A racially diverse group of about 200 people walked with a police escort from Wayman\u2019s Chapel AME Church to Court Square, where they held a rally encouraging people to vote. The event was organized by Rev. Greg Drumwright, a Burlington native who leads the the Citadel Church in Greensboro, according to his website. At least three politicians participated in some parts of the event: the current mayor of Burlington, Ian Baltutis; Democratic candidate for county commissioner Dreama Caldwell; and Democratic school board candidate Seneca Rodgers. At one point, the marchers held a moment of silence in the street in honor of George Floyd, the Black man killed while in police custody in Minneapolis earlier this summer. After the moment of silence concluded, law enforcement told people to clear the road. Then, deputies and police officers used pepper spray on the crowd and began arresting people. Several children in the crowd were affected by the pepper spray. Melanie Mitchell said her 5-year-old and 11-year-old daughters were pepper-sprayed just after the moment of silence. She said Graham police approached the crowd assembled in the street and told them to move onto the sidewalk and soon began spraying pepper spray toward the ground. Mitchell\u2019s 5-year-old took off running, she said. Both kids threw up. \u201cMy 11-year-old was terrified,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to come down to Graham anymore.\u201d Josh Stein, the attorney general of North Carolina, issued a statement on the conflagration, saying: \u201cAll eligible voters in North Carolina have a constitutional right to cast their vote safely and securely, without threats or intimidation. After today\u2019s troubling events in Alamance county, I went to the courthouse in Graham and all is calm now. \u201cI reached out to the State Board of Elections and was informed that the events appear not to have impacted voting at the early voting location. The site there was calm, and the voters got in line and voted. I have also reached out to the Alamance county sheriff but have not yet connected. I will update when I learn more.\u201d The offspring of Donald Trump are out in force today. Eric Trump has been on Catholic radio complaining about Christmas trees, Donald Trump Jr is in Montana with erstwhile Guardian assaulter Greg Gianforte, and Ivanka Trump is here in Youngstown, Ohio, pumping up the masses ahead of Tuesday. Ivanka is the latest surrogate to be dispatched to Ohio, a state that Trump won comfortably in 2016 after Barack Obama triumphed in 2008 and 2012. Despite Trump\u2019s 2016 win, Joe Biden is running neck-and-neck with the president this year, suggesting the disaffected voters who voted for Trump in 2016 might be having second thoughts. Ivanka has just warned the crowd that 700,000 fracking jobs would be wiped out in Ohio if Joe Biden \u2013 who in reality has specifically said he will not ban fracking \u2013 is elected. In any case, the people here are having a good time, despite having to sit on increasingly muddy ground in front of Ivanka\u2019s stage. Judith Shortreed, 75, is here with her friend Mary Holland, 85. They are both members of the Trumbull county women for Trump group, a more than dozen-strong organization dedicated to re-electing the president. Both Shortreed and Holland were wearing pink \u2018Women for Trump\u2019 hats, which had been signed by Donald Trump Jr. They were hoping to get Ivanka to sign them too. \u201cI\u2019ve always admired Ivanka. She does so much for the children, she does so much for women, she\u2019s a delightful speaker, I just love the enthusiasm of being involved,\u201d Shortreed said. Holland campaigned for Trump in 2016, and was even a guest of the campaign at the inauguration in DC. A camera crew filmed Holland getting her hair done before the inauguration, she told the Guardian. She added that she was wearing the same coat she wore that day. A fervent supporter of Trump, Holland said: \u201cI believe in everything he believes in.\u201d The pair wasn\u2019t sure if Trump would win in 2016, but this year they are convinced of his victory. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a landslide,\u201d Shortreed said. \u201cBecause \u2013 I don\u2019t even know if this is any indication or not \u2013 but I think Trump has signs in people\u2019s driveways 10 times more than [Biden has]. When you see the crowds that Trump is able to assemble \u2013 20,000 compared to 20 for Biden \u2013 he just has the country all revved up.\u201d The Guardian suggested this could be because Biden is deliberately holding smaller rallies, in a stated effort to thwart the spread of coronavirus. Not so, said Shortreed. \u201cIt\u2019s the Pelosis and the Schumerss and the deep state that don\u2019t want him out,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause number one, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, and number two, he\u2019s constantly making gaffes.\u201d Nina Lakhani reports from Pennsylvania, where she is speaking with Trump supporters outside his rally at Reading regional airport ... Vincent Tusa, 56, who works in advertising and twice voted for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, is a third-generation Italian American who supports Donald Trump\u2019s hardline \u2013 some would say cruel and unjust \u2013 immigration policies. \u201cI\u2019m not a staunch Republican but we can\u2019t be overrun by illegal immigrants. They need to come legally like my grandparents.\u201d Advocates have documented the dismantling of America\u2019s immigration and asylum system over the past four years, as well as the separation of thousands of children from their parents at the southern border. Tusa added: \u201cTrump is a businessman and that gives me confidence. Biden doesn\u2019t have the accomplishments, he\u2019s cognitively challenged and he\u2019s chosen an unqualified running mate based on identity politics.\u201d Vice-president candidate Kamala Harris\u2019s experience includes being state attorney general and a US senator for California. Tusa was wearing a mask but many people were not. However, volunteers were checking people\u2019s temperatures as they entered the airport for the second of Trump\u2019s four rallies on Saturday in the crucial swing state. Nicolette Miller, 30, is here with her friend Megan Shaddick, 30. They grew up nearby but now live in Philadelphia. Both will be voting for Trump for the second time and said the main reason for coming today was to be around like-minded people to express their support for the president without fear of being called racist. \u201cHe stands behind small businesses, our law enforcement and hard-working people \u2013 that\u2019s what this country was built on. And look at what he achieved in the Middle East: four major peace deals,\u201d said Miller. \u201cHe\u2019s done more than any other president in the history of America. He\u2019s trying to find the parents of those 500 children separated at the border but their parents are coming to claim them because they are illegal. The mainstream media spins and takes out of context everything he says,\u201d added Shaddick. Trump won the state\u2019s precious 20 electoral votes by just over 44,000 votes in 2016 \u2013 or less than one percentage point \u2013 but the RealClearPolitics average of recent Pennsylvania polls, taken between 21 and 27 October, shows Biden with an 3.7-point advantage. Donald Trump, who is currently at the podium at the second of four rallies today in Pennsylvania, has issued a statement on the rescue of an American citizen in Nigeria. US special forces rescued Philip Walton, 27, who was abducted on Tuesday from his home in neighboring southern Niger, two US officials said on condition of anonymity. Last night, at my direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage in Nigeria, kidnapped just 96 hours earlier. United States Special Forces executed a daring nighttime operation to rescue their fellow American with exceptional skill, precision, and bravery. No United States Service Members were harmed. The former hostage is currently in good health and has been reunited with his family. Securing the freedom of Americans held in captivity abroad has been a top national security priority of my Administration. Since the beginning of my Administration, we have rescued over 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries. Today\u2019s operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and criminal thugs who mistakenly believe they can kidnap Americans with impunity. Niger, like much of West Africa\u2019s Sahel region, faces a deepening security crisis as groups with links to al-Qaida and the Islamic State carry out attacks on the army and civilians, despite help from French and US forces. Four US soldiers were killed in an ambush in Niger in 2017, sparking debate about the US role in the sparsely populated West African desert that is home to some of the world\u2019s poorest countries. In a stunning display of enthusiasm, more than 9.6m Texans have voted ahead of election day, surpassing the total number of votes cast four years ago. What that means for the races up and down the ballot is \u201cthe million dollar question\u201d, says Emily M Farris, an associate professor of political science at Texas Christian University. \u201cWe just don\u2019t really know,\u201d she says. In what has been a reliably red state with low voter participation, 30.4% of this year\u2019s ballots have been cast by voters who didn\u2019t participate in 2016 at all, according to Tom Bonier, chief executive of political data firm TargetSmart. Turnout has surged especially among Asian, college-educated white and young Texans. \u201cYou can definitively say now, more voters under the age of 30 have voted already in Texas than have ever voted in any election, and that\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Bonier says. Nearly 4.2m Texans who voted early do not have a history of voting in either party\u2019s primary election, Republican consultant Derek Ryan wrote in a report on Friday. Around 1.7m live in Republican-dominated precincts, while 1.2m are from areas that typically swing Democratic. Ryan expects more than 12m Texans to vote when all is said and done, which would amount to a double-digit spike in turnout from 2016. \u201cClearly people are interested, and they\u2019re motivated with this election,\u201d says Juan Carlos Huerta, a professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M University, Corpus Christi. But at the US-Mexico border, large Hispanic communities and Democratic strongholds with chronically low turnout are not keeping up with the rest of the state. In El Paso county, where Covid-19 cases have surged and officials have imposed tougher restrictions, 45.4% of registered voters have voted. Those numbers have only reached 48.2% in Hidalgo county, in the Rio Grande Valley, compared to 57% statewide. \u201cTexas is a tough state to vote in,\u201d Huerta says. \u201cAnd, you know, there\u2019s plenty of folks who would say \u2018Oh, that\u2019s by design,\u2019 because it\u2019s designed to discourage participation.\u201d Donald Trump is still slightly favored to win Texas \u2013 a state he took by nine points in 2016 \u2013 though polls showing a close race have ignited a firestorm of speculation about whether this is the year the state actually turns blue. \u201cWe feel good with where we\u2019re at, but we need to keep on going, and you know, we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d says Abhi Rahman, communications director for the Texas Democratic party. On top of the battle for the White House, Texas is home to a key Senate race, as air force veteran MJ Hegar tries to unseat Republican John Cornyn. But Cornyn is still favored to win re-election, and despite a more competitive race than many would have predicted back in March, \u201cit would be a surprise\u201d if Hegar prevailed, Farris says. \u201cTexas hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat, you know, statewide in more than two decades now,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so that kind of shift in Texas would be a pretty big change.\u201d Texas Democrats said they cancelled a campaign event on Friday for \u201cpublic safety and security reasons\u201d, after a group of Trump supporters driving trucks followed a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a highway outside of Austin. While vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris was campaigning in Texas that day, she was not on the bus, a spokesman for a state Democratic representative confirmed. Multiple video clips posted on social media showed trucks flying Trump flags surrounding a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a highway. \u201cThey\u2019re like chasing him,\u201d a man says, laughing as he narrates one clip shared by Trump supporters. \u201cThey\u2019re literally escorting him out of town.\u201d A group of the same 12 cars has been following the Biden bus all over the country, CBS News Austin reported, citing Texas Democrats. A Democratic campaign event scheduled for Friday evening in Pflugerville was cancelled due to security concerns related to the cars following the Biden bus, Sheryl Cole, a Democratic state representative, tweeted on Friday. \u201cUnfortunately, Pro-Trump Protesters have escalated well beyond safe limits,\u201d she wrote. The decision to cancel the Pflugerville event came after Democrats received reports in the late afternoon that there had been some kind of collision between a pro-Trump vehicle and another vehicle on I-35, Andr\u00e9 Treiber, a spokesperson for Cole, told the Guardian. The details of the incident on the highway are still not clear, Treiber said, including whether the collision turned out to be \u201can accident or an escalation\u201d. \u201cWhen you have two hours to make the call, you make the safe call,\u201d Treiber said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure everyone was safe.\u201d An event with Democratic politicians in Austin was also cancelled on Friday, but CBS News Austin reported that Democrats in Austin said the cancellation was not prompted by security concerns, but by the decision not to take focus from Kamala Harris, who was making appearances elsewhere in the state. When the Biden-Harris bus stopped briefly in Austin earlier on Friday, Trump supporters heckled and faced off with Democrats, with Trump supporters calling Biden a \u201cChinese communist\u201d, CBS Austin reported. The cars following the bus include a pro-Trump hearse emblazoned with the slogan, \u201cVote like your life depends on it,\u201d according to social media and news reports. Republicans apologized after Trump supporters brought a casket to a Biden event outside Houston, with a dark-haired mannequin that some viewers saw as representing Kamala Harris, a local Fox News affiliate reported. Axios reports that early voting in the 2020 election on Saturday afternoon had already reached 65.5% of 2016\u2019s total turnout, citing state data compiled by the US Elections Project. Michael McDonald, the University of Florida professor who administers the US Elections Project, said last week the high level of early voting augurs a record turnout of about 150 million, representing 65% of eligible voters, the highest rate since 1908. Barack Obama vouched for Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdecency and kindness\u201d while taking a swipe at Donald Trump\u2019s idea of masculine strength in an appeal to Michigan voters in their first joint campaign appearance at Flint Northwestern High School. An excerpt from the former US president\u2019s remarks: With Joe and Kamala at the helm \u2026 you\u2019re not going to have to think about them every day. You\u2019re not going to have to argue with your family about him every day. It won\u2019t be so exhausting. You\u2019ll be able to get on with your lives knowing that the president is not going to suggest we inject bleach as a possible cure of Covid. You won\u2019t have to wake up in the morning, kind of open your phone and, hey, news flash: the president retweeted conspiracy theories that the Navy Seals didn\u2019t actually kill Bin Laden. You\u2019re not going to have a president who goes out of his way to insult people just because they don\u2019t support them. This is not normal behavior, people. We would not tolerate it from a teacher or a coach or a co-worker or a family member. If a neighbor was acting like this, you would stay away from that neighbor. Why would we accept it from the president of the United States? And you know what, there are consequences to his actions. There are consequences to his actions. This is not just a joke. It\u2019s not funny. Those actions embolden other people to be mean, and divisive, and racist. And it frays at the fabric of all of our lives and it affects how our children see the world and how they treat each other. It affects the way our families get along. It affects the way the world sees America. That\u2019s why Joe talks about the soul of America. That\u2019s why he talks about decency, and kindness, and responsibility and hard work. That more than anything is what separates Joe Biden from his opponent: he actually cares about every American. He does not have a mean-spirited bone in his body. I have seen him spend time with people, strangers that he doesn\u2019t know, when he hears they\u2019re going through hardship, he talks about what he\u2019s gone through. When he sees a kid, his eyes light up because because he thinks about his own kids and grandkids. Joe Biden tries to live the values we cherish: honesty, hard work, kindness, humility, responsibility, helping somebody else out. That used to be the definition of manliness. Not strutting and showing off, acting important, bullying people. It used to be being a man meant taking care of other people. Not going around bragging, but just doing the work. Not looking for credit. Trying to live right. Passing on those values to your kids. Looking out for a community. Carrying your weight. Giving up a little bit of what you might have to help somebody who has a real need. When you elect Joe, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see reflected from the White House. And those shouldn\u2019t be Republican or Democratic values \u2013 they didn\u2019t used to be! They\u2019re what we grew up learning for our parents and from our grandparents. And they\u2019re the values we still try to teach our kids. And they\u2019re not white or black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American values \u2013 they\u2019re American values. And we\u2019ve got to reclaim them right now. And to reclaim them, we\u2019re going have to turn out like never before. And if we\u2019re going to reclaim those values, we need to leave no doubt. We can\u2019t afford to be complacent. Not this time. Not in this election. Barack Obama has taken the stage at a drive-in campaign event in Flint, the first stop of a two-city jaunt alongside Joe Biden through Michigan today. You can watch above. Polls show that Biden has maintained his lead in Michigan, a traditional Democratic stronghold which Donald Trump won by a 0.3% margin that averaged out to two votes per precinct in 2016. The RealClearPolitics average of recent Michigan polls, taken between 21 and 27 October, shows Biden with an 8.7-point advantage over the incumbent president. \u201cJust in time for election day, Donald Trump\u2019s last South Florida rally and expectations the first lady will cast her vote locally,\u201d the Palm Beach Post reports, \u201cthe Times Square billboards showing Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner seemingly delighting in the death and suffering caused by the coronavirus pandemic will be floating near Mar-a-Lago this weekend.\u201d Which is about the size of it. The original billboards caused a huge kerfuffle last weekend, which was precisely the intention of the Lincoln Project, the anti-Trump, pro-Biden group of former Republican consultants who put them up. Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for the president, sent a threatening letter, demanding the \u201cfalse, malicious and defamatory\u201d ads be removed, or \u201cwe will sue you for what will doubtless be enormous compensatory and punitive damages\u201d. The Lincoln Project hoped that would happen too, and was ready with a stinging response, citing first amendment free speech protections and one of the most amusing cases in all US constitutional law, \u201cone of the seminal libel-proof plaintiff cases\u201d \u2026 that of a well-known mobster whose reputation was \u201cso tarnished \u2026 he could claim no damages for defamation\u201d. \u201cMr Kushner and Ms Trump\u2019s claims,\u201d the Lincoln Project\u2019s attorney wrote\u2026 \u2026 will fare no better than Boobie Cerasini\u2019s, given their tarnished reputations on Covid-19.\u201d Ron Steslow, one of the founders of the Lincoln Project, told the Palm Beach Post: \u201cThis falls into our psychological warfare \u2013 to take them off message. We hit the bull\u2019s eye with these.\u201d The president was in Pennsylvania on Saturday and told the pool reporter he planned to spend election night, on Tuesday, between the White House and his Washington hotel. Regardless, the Lincoln Project also said it planned to have a truck version of the billboard circling Trump Tower in New York this weekend. An Illinois judge ordered 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse to be extradited to Wisconsin on Friday to face homicide charges there in the shooting deaths of two men at a protest against police violence in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Police documents about Rittenhouse\u2019s arrest, obtained by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel after a lawsuit, also offered new details about how the teenager obtained the rifle used in the shooting, which he was not old enough to buy or possess under Wisconsin law. Rittenhouse said the rifle he used was purchased by an 18-year-old friend who lived in Wisconsin, and the police records state it was found in the trunk of his friend\u2019s car, the Journal-Sentinel reported. Both teenagers had been at the volatile late-night protest in Kenosha, they said, but the friend told an officer was standing with a gun on the rooftop of a business and did not see the shooting. The 18-year-old friend said that Rittenhouse \u201chad given him money to buy the rifle\u201d at a local hardware store, that it was \u201conly to be used while hunting up north at the friend\u2019s family property,\u201d and that it had been stored at his stepfather\u2019s house, the Journal-Sentinel reported. The stepfather told investigators he was aware that the 18-year-old had purchased a gun for his 17-year-old friend, and said he had insisted that the gun be kept in his own locked gun safe because of Rittenhouse\u2019s age. But he said he had taken the gun out of the safe to have it ready during protests against police violence in Kenosha, and that the 18-year-old had taken it without his permission. According to the police report, the friend recalled telling Rittenhouse after the shooting that he was going to be in trouble because he purchased the gun. \u201cIn all reality, you are not supposed to have that gun. That gun was in my name,\u201d the Journal-Sentinel reported. Straw purchasing, buying a gun for someone who is not legally allowed to have one, is a serious federal crime. But local prosecutors have not charged the 18-year-old friend with any crime, the Journal-Sentinel reported. Accompanied by his mother, Rittenhouse turned himself in at the police department in his hometown in Illinois just hours after the shooting, the Journal-Sentinel reported. The police report notes he was emotional at moments, at one time saying, \u201c\u201dI shot two white kids,\u201d and that a medical examination revealed \u201csmall scratches on his arm but no bruising or cuts.\u201d Rittenhouse claimed to officers that he had been hired to protect a business in Kenosha, a claim his lawyer echoed in a Fox News interview. But a Kenosha car dealer has publicly denied hiring armed men to guard his business, the Journal-Sentinel reported previously. Nina Lakhani reports from Pennsylvania: It was supposed to be peaceful Biden/Harris caravan through Nazareth Borough Park, in pivotal Northampton county. Instead, the midday event was gatecrashed by a couple of dozen honking vehicles adorned with huge Trump flags and Biden effigies. \u201cObama\u2019s a piece of shit,\u201d screamed one man through a megaphone. \u201cLatinos for Trump,\u201d yelled another who was originally from Chile and taunted the other side for having no minorities among them. At one point, someone shouted \u201cKKK!\u201d Tigh Hillegas, 43, a concrete worker from neighboring Lehigh county, said they\u2019d come to show the other side that they were more pumped and energized \u201cI\u2019m voting for freedom. If we get socialism, we won\u2019t be able to protest our government like we are today. Trump has exposed how bad the [political] swamp really is.\u201d Hillegas dismissed reports of Trump\u2019s tax evasion as made up, before adding: \u201cIf they say abortion is about the right to choose, choosing to risk Covid is my right.\u201d Not a single Trump supporter was wearing a mask as they shouted insults and taunts at the masked Biden supporters. \u201cWhy would you vote for pedophiles and baby killers?\u201d shouted one woman who declined to give her name. The Biden supporters largely refused to rise to the bait, but were visibly upset. Jennifer Peterson, 61, a dental hygienist, said: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that we can\u2019t come out to protest without being bullied and harassed. I\u2019m sure Trump is going to try and steal the election. I just pray that this is still America and our laws protect us.\u201d Regi Koonsman, 71, a retired teacher, said: \u201cTrump is the most corrupt, inept, incompetent president we\u2019ve ever had \u2013 and I\u2019m not exaggerating. His handling of the pandemic has been deplorable. I\u2019ve never seen division like this \u2013 and I\u2019ve been around a long time. I blame Trump and the Republican senators who\u2019ve enabled him.\u201d The Biden caravan set off with the honking Trump fans tailing them through the county. More here: I\u2019m going to hand over to my colleague Bryan Armen Graham. But here\u2019s a quick roundup of where things stand today: Donald Trump is holding four rallies in crucial swing-state Pennsylvania. As he departed from Joint Base Andrews, he told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very interesting three days. It\u2019s going to be a very interesting Tuesday.\u201cA big red wave has formed. We\u2019re doing very well.\u201d Joe Biden has left Delaware for Michigan, where he\u2019ll hold two drive-in rallies with Barack Obama. The pair will visit Flint shortly and then on to Detroit. Researchers at Stanford University say 700 deaths were probably caused by 18 Trump rallies. Their paper said: \u201cApplying county-specific post-event death rates, we conclude that the rallies likely led to more than 700 deaths (not necessarily among attendees).\u201d Louisiana is seeing long lines and big turnout as residents vote before election day. Despite serious logistical hurdles, nearly a million had voted in-person or by mail by the conclusion of early voting on 27 October, close to a third of registered Louisiana voters. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo praised \u201csome of our bravest and most skilled warriors\u201d after US special forces in Nigeria rescued an American citizen abducted in neighboring Niger earlier this week. Donald Trump tweeted of a \u201c big win for our very elite special forces\u201d. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading. US researchers have suggested that a series of recent Trump rallies probably produced more than 30,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and \u201clikely led to more than 700 deaths\u201d. The study, released on Friday by scientists at Stanford University, looked at \u201cthe effects of large group meetings on the spread of Covid-19 by studying the impact of 18 Trump campaign rallies\u201d over \u201cup to 10 post-rally weeks for each event\u201d. \u201cOur estimate of the average treatment effect across the 18 events,\u201d they wrote, \u201cimplies that they increased subsequent confirmed cases of Covid-19 by more than 250 per 100,000 residents. \u201cExtrapolating this figure to the entire sample, we conclude that these 18 rallies ultimately resulted in more than 30,000 incremental confirmed cases of Covid-19. Applying county-specific post-event death rates, we conclude that the rallies likely led to more than 700 deaths (not necessarily among attendees).\u201d New York\u2019s quarantine travel list has been replaced with new testing protocols in which people coming from out of state must enter with a negative Covid test, according to reports. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday he is replacing the mandate that had required a 14-day quarantine for persons arriving from states with high levels of Covid transmission. Under Cuomo\u2019s new requirement, travelers arriving from out of state must enter New York with proof that they had a negative Covid-19 test within three days of arriving, according to Syracuse.com. After coming into New York, travelers must quarantine for three days. On the fourth day, they have to undergo another Covid-19 test. If this fourth-day test is negative, they are no longer under a quarantine requirement, Cuomo reportedly said. Travelers who don\u2019t undergo Covid tests will still have to quarantine for 14 days, the report said. Travelers who leave New York for 24 hours or less have to undergo a test \u2013 and show a negative result \u2013 within four days after their return to the state. The just-announced testing requirements do not apply to New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Connecticut. As Donald Trump heads to Pennsylvania today, Joe Biden and Barack Obama will campaign together in Michigan. The pair will hold a drive-in event in Flint, which will begin shortly, and then head to Detroit, for another drive-in rally, set to begin at 5.30pm. Stevie Wonder is scheduled to join Biden and Obama in Detroit. Polls show that Biden has maintained his lead in Michigan. The RealClearPolitics average of recent Michigan polls, taken between 21 and 27 October, shows Biden with an 8.7-point advantage over Trump. In 2016, Trump won Michigan, which has 16 electoral college votes, by 0.3 points. Barack Obama will travel to Florida and Georgia on Monday to campaign for Joe Biden and for Democratic Georgia Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. David Perdue, the Republican Ossoff is trying to unseat, pulled out of their final scheduled debate on Thursday, a day after Ossoff had denounced him as a \u201ccrook\u201d who downplayed the threat of Covid. Ossoff said, witheringly: \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you\u2019re a crook, senator, it\u2019s that you\u2019re attacking the health of the people you represent.\u201d Perdue denied Ossoff\u2019s claims but decided to withdraw from the final debate, preferring instead to attend a rally with Donald Trump. Donald Trump spoke briefly to reporters this morning, on his way from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to Pennsylvania. The president is scheduled to hold four rallies, in Newton, Reading, Butler and Montoursville. He was asked: where will you be on election night? Trump said: \u201cI\u2019ll be perhaps between the White House and the hotel. I guess they placed a limit yesterday on the hotel. They did that yesterday in Minnesota. Just ridiculous. Thousands and thousands of people were disenfranchised. They traveled for many miles to be there. \u201cWe\u2019re spending the day in Pennsylvania. And I think we\u2019re doing extremely well with the votes. It\u2019s going to be a very interesting three days. It\u2019s going to be a very interesting Tuesday. \u201cA big red wave has formed. We\u2019re doing very well.\u201d From a \u201cred wave\u201d to a \u201cred mirage\u201d: Tom McCarthy has been looking into the possibility of election-night chaos. Known as the \u201cred mirage\u201d, the scenario could develop if Trump appears to be leading in the presidential race late on election night and declares victory before all the votes are counted. The scenario can be averted, election officials say, by heightening public awareness about it \u2013 and by cautioning vigilance against carefully targeted lies that Donald Trump has already begun to tell. More from Tom here: Gabby Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was seriously injured after being shot in the head in the 2011 gun attack in Tucson, Arizona, in which six people died, has endorsed Joe Biden for president in a Fox News op-ed. Giffords writes: \u201cJoe Biden was there for me during those initial difficult months. When it was time for me to return to the floor of the House of Representatives in August 2011, he came over from the White House to welcome me back. Since then, as I founded and then led an organization dedicated to saving lives from gun violence, Biden has fiercely championed the work we\u2019re doing. \u201cIf we elect Joe Biden as president of the United States, I believe that we as a nation are going to be OK. Not immediately, because that\u2019s not how recovery works \u2013 you can\u2019t flip a switch and heal. But in the weeks and months to come, Joe Biden will help us put the broken pieces back together, just like he inspired me to do with my own recovery. \u201cJoe Biden leads with his heart. No matter the issue, he has the compassion and toughness to get the job done. I want a president whose empathy is matched by an ironclad determination to make the world a better place. That candidate is Joe Biden.\u201d Giffords\u2019 husband, Mark Kelly, is running to flip Republican Martha McSally\u2019s US Senate seat for the Democrats. In a tight race, McSally is trailing slightly behind Kelly, according to RealClearPolitics. At an Arizona rally this week, Trump told McSally to hurry up and speak quickly, in remarks that were widely criticized as disrespectful. No, Melania Trump does not have a body double. People on social media got very excited after a picture circulated of the first lady leaving the White House for the final debate in Nashville last week, which users claimed just didn\u2019t look like her. Cue the frenzy. But it\u2019s a baseless conspiracy theory. Fact-checking website Snopes comprehensively debunks it. Apparently the conspiracy theory, which has been around for some time, has been fuelled in large part by the fact that the first lady has a Secret Service agent who looks \u201cstrikingly similar\u201d to her. There is, however, no body double. At the State Archives Building in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Pastor Errol Domingue watched as people drove up, then kept driving once they saw the line to vote. He had set aside three hours on a Saturday to cast his ballot. So when he ended up waiting in a crowd for 50 minutes to an hour, he said: \u201cI really had no problems.\u201d \u201cI was determined,\u201d Domingue said. \u201cI\u2019m a Black man in the Deep South, and so I\u2019m kind of hyper-sensitive to this idea of discouragement in voting, and suppression in voting.\u201d Amid record-breaking turnout during Louisiana\u2019s early voting period, which after a legal battle was extended from seven to 10 days in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, voters fielded long wait times in close spaces across the state. In Caddo Parish, where a single early voting site served around 240,000 residents, people stood in line for hours. An image posted online showed congested, winding queues and an ambulance in the distance at a polling place in Jefferson Parish\u2019s Marrero. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we weren\u2019t prepared to be able to address what we knew would be record turnout for what is an election of our lifetime, I think, or our generation for sure,\u201d said Ashley K Shelton, executive director of the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice. When Pastor Fred Jeff Smith\u2019s wife tried to vote at the State Archives Building, she encountered a wait of up to two hours. Although she was able to cast a ballot during a later trip to the same polling location, the prospect of such a huge time commitment didn\u2019t appeal to Smith, who has decided to go on election day instead. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I had that kind of time to give up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know that I\u2019m going to vote on Tuesday.\u201d Despite serious logistical hurdles, nearly a million had voted in-person or by mail by the conclusion of early voting on 27 October, close to a third of registered Louisiana voters. Demographically, Black Louisianans comprised more and Republicans less of the vote than in 2016, as the state logged just under half of the total turnout from four years ago. \u201cIt is exciting to see traditionally marginalized and underserved communities really working to get the vote out,\u201d Domingue said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this in my lifetime.\u201d With days to go until the election, a Black Voices for Trump function in Ohio on Friday night represented one of the last chances for the Trump campaign to win over Black voters in the state. Unfortunately for Trump, the event in Cleveland, a city with a population of 383,000, drew a total of 20 people. It didn\u2019t seem to bother Katrina Pierson, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign who as Trump\u2019s former spokesperson, has echoed conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticized women who accused Trump of sexual assault. \u201cWe have a leader in Donald Trump who has kept promises he didn\u2019t even make,\u201d Pierson told the audience. Pierson did not elaborate on how that would work, but did offer an optimistic take on Trump\u2019s re-election chances. \u201cThe numbers right now look phenomenal,\u201d Pierson said, despite all evidence to the contrary. \u201cEarly voting \u2026 it\u2019s not looking so great for the Democrats. Have you heard about that? You won\u2019t read about that. But it\u2019s true.\u201d Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2016, compared to Mitt Romney\u2019s 6% in 2012, and Joe Biden is expected to win the overall Black vote convincingly. But polling suggests a generational gap, with Trump\u2019s support among younger Black people having increased since 2016. At the Cleveland event, held in a dimly lit campaign office in the east of the city, five of the attendees appeared to be white people, with \u201cAs a black person, it\u2019s the things that he has done specifically that will effect Black people positively,\u201d said Lawrence Hill, 58. \u201cHe\u2019s supported all black colleges and universities,\u201d Hill said. \u201cObama really didn\u2019t try to do anything to help our black colleges and universities.\u201d Trump has claimed he \u201csaved\u201d Historically Black colleges and universities \u2013 higher education facilities established prior to 1964 with a mission to educate Black Americans \u2013 by allocating permanent funding. Fact checkers have pointed out that while Trump did sign a bill drafted by Democrats and Republicans, the amount of funding allocated to HBCUs has changed little from Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Still, Hill predicted a groundswell of support for Trump come Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s an undercurrent of Black people who are going to come out and support our president. I\u2019ve met more this year than I\u2019ve ever met in my life,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHispanic and black voters, we are the ones who are going to to turn this thing out.\u201d Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has issued a statement on the rescue of an American citizen in Nigeria. US special forces rescued Philip Walton, 27, who was abducted on Tuesday from his home in neighboring southern Niger, two US officials said on condition of anonymity The operation in northern Nigeria is believed to have killed several of his captors, officials said. A diplomatic source in Niger said Walton is now at the US ambassador\u2019s residence in Niamey, Niger\u2019s capital. Pompeo said in the statement: \u201cThe United States is committed to the safe return of all US citizens taken captive. We delivered on that commitment late last night in Nigeria, where some of our bravest and most skilled warriors rescued a US citizen after a group of armed men took him hostage across the border in Niger. \u201cThanks to the extraordinary courage and capabilities of our military, the support of our intelligence professionals, and our diplomatic efforts, the hostage will be reunited with his family. We will never abandon any American taken hostage.\u201d Trump also mentioned the raid on Twitter. He wrote of a \u201cbig win for our very elite US special forces\u201d. Unsurprisingly, billionaires have been spending big this election campaign. Sheldon Adelson, the super-rich casino mogul, is expected to have spent a quarter of a billion dollars this cycle to support Trump, Republicans and other conservative causes. Peter Stone reports that Adelson, a close acquaintance of Trump, and his wife Miriam, an Israeli-born physician, have already spent a single election record sum of $183m through 14 October, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. Adelson, 87, has made his huge donations even as his casino empire, which stretches from Las Vegas to Asia, has seen its revenues drop significantly this year because of Covid. The data showed that the second biggest donor behind Adelson has been Michael Bloomberg, who has spent $107m, much of it on ads in Florida to help Biden, CRP data shows. More from Peter here: On Saturday night, Democrats yearning for a blue wave on election day might choose to look to the skies for an omen: a blue moon. Blue moons, typically defined as the second full moon in one month, are rare, arriving every two to three years. According to Earthsky.org, the last was on 31 March 2018. Confusingly, an older definition of blue moon refers to the third of four full moons in a season which, because seasons usually last three months, is one more full moon than expected. The next such seasonal blue moon will come on 22 August next year. More confusingly still, full moons in October are generally known as \u201chunter\u2019s moons\u201d. But though this month\u2019s first full moon was on 1 October, it was a \u201charvest moon\u201d. According to Astronomy.com, that is a \u201cname reserved for the full moon that occurs closest to the autumnal equinox\u201d, which means harvest moons are usually seen in September. Those hoping for dramatic Halloween spookiness may well be disappointed on Saturday, as the term \u201cblue moon\u201d does not refer to color. The Washington Post noted that cynics downplay blue moons as \u201cvisually unremarkable, pedestrian\u201d and pretty much like every other full moon. That said, there have been times when the moon has turned blue \u2013 coinciding with volcanic eruptions. In 1883, the eruption of Krakatoa shot so many \u201cvolcanic aerosol\u201d materials into the sky that it scattered \u201ccertain wavelengths of light, leaving the moon tinged an unusual aquamarine at the edge\u201d the Post reported. Blue moons have occurred amid other volcanic eruptions, such as Mexico\u2019s El Chichon in 1983. On Saturday, Earthsky.org offered a consolation to any disappointed moon gazers, pointing out that Mars will shine \u201cbright red\u201d near tonight\u2019s blue moon. Thanks Martin. This is Tim Hill taking over for a short while. Our national affairs correspondent Tom McCarthy has been looking at Pennsylvania polls: the final Muhlenberg College/Morning Call poll of the election season has been released, and shows Joe Biden with a slim five-point lead over Trump, by 49% to 44%, in the race for Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral college votes. Tom writes that Muhlenberg is \u201ca gold-standard pollster. If polls in Pennsylvania have a 2016-magnitude error this time, Biden wins the state \u2013 barely \u2013 with such a margin. That is, IF every vote is counted. Looks close. \u201cMuhlenberg is among those pollsters that adjusted their methodologies after 2016, weighting for educational attainment in effort to make sure not to undercount in this case especially Trump voters.\u201d More here: Colorado\u2019s Democratic Rep. Jason Crow has issued one of those videos this morning where they don\u2019t have to mention someone by name, but you know exactly who they are talking about. It\u2019s a rallying call to vote, and to protect the right to vote. And to understand how a US election works. This is our democracy at work. And we can never take it for granted. Our men and women in uniform fought and died defending it. Generations of heroes, from suffragettes and Civil Rights icons like John Lewis, to ordinary Americans whose names we will never know, risked everything. That fight for our fundamental rights isn\u2019t over. Even today there are plenty of politicians trying to make voting harder, instead of easier. But it\u2019s not going to work. thanks to the heroes who came before us. 2020 is not a typical year, and it\u2019s not going to be a typical election night either. Because of the pandemic we may not know every result right away. It might take some time, and a little extra patience. You may see some people complaining, and even tweeting about that, especially if they think they\u2019re going to lose. But no amount of disinformation spread by a few blustery individuals is going to drown out the voices and the votes of the American people. For all the ways this year is different. Our basic voting process is the same as it\u2019s always been. So straightforward, any child in America can tell you how it works. We vote. We count all the votes. And we figure out who got the most. And that\u2019s your lot from me today. I\u2019m going to hand across the ocean to Tim Hill. I will see you tomorrow, same time, same place\u2026 Do you remember this rather curious image from back in 2017? Well, you can relive that and many more in a gallery we\u2019ve published this morning of some of the most memorable images of president Donald Trump\u2019s first term as president. We\u2019ll find out next week, I guess, whether they are the defining images of his era, or whether we\u2019ll need to prep a volume two for 2024. There\u2019s going to be a rally at noon today at Princeton post office to protest the mail-in ballot delays that have appeared to emerge in Miami-Dade county [see 7:14]. Arwa Mahdawi files her latest column for us today, saying that women will decide this election \u2013 and Trump keeps insulting them. Donald Trump saved your damn neighbourhood, OK? He\u2019s saving your house. He\u2019s saving your community. He fixed your dishwashers. He\u2019s keeping your crime way down. And he\u2019s getting your husbands back to work! But despite this unhinged, and racism-tinged, list of imaginary accomplishments \u2013 which Trump trots out at every rally \u2013 suburban women are turning their backs on the president. Biden leads by 23 points among suburban women in swing states, according to recent polls, and by 19 points among suburban women overall, according to Pew Research. This is a big problem for Trump. 53% of white women voted for him in 2016; white women in battleground states like Pennsylvania helped usher him to victory, now they could lose him the election. Biden is currently beating Trump by 6.7 points in Pennsylvania, largely because he\u2019s lost the support of white women. (It should be noted that while there are plenty of non-white women in the suburbs, Suburban Women tends to be code for white women \u2013 Trump certainly uses it that way.) Trump can\u2019t seem to figure out why on earth the Suburban Housewives of America, who he tweets incessantly about, aren\u2019t keen on him. Nor can he figure out a coherent strategy to get them back: like an abusive ex-boyfriend, he\u2019s been veering between angry threats and pathetic groveling, demanding that women appreciate all he\u2019s done for them. \u201cSuburban women, will you please like me?\u201d Trump bellowed at a recent rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cPlease. I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?\u201d That isn\u2019t all he\u2019s done for women, apparently. At a rally on Tuesday, Trump boasted that he\u2019s \u201cgetting your husbands back to work\u201d. This would be a condescending thing to say in any context, but it\u2019s particularly infuriating when women have had to leave the workforce at a greater rate than men due to the pandemic. In September, 865,000 women left the US workforce, four times more than men.

Joe Biden has criticised the president for still having no plan to address Covid. The president\u2019s son, and his senior advisor for strategy, have both doubled-down on keeping the economy open, even as the US sets new record levels for coronavirus case numbers. Samuel Gilbert writes for us today about \u2018an incredible scar\u2019 \u2013 the harsh toll of Trump\u2019s 400-mile wall through national parks on the US-Mexico border: In the 1980s, When Kevin Dahl first began visiting the Organ Pipe Cactus national monument in southern Arizona, the border was unmarked, save for a simple fence used to keep cattle from a ranch in the US from crossing into Mexico. In those days, park rangers would call in their lunch orders at a diner located just across the border. Since then, a 30ft steel bollard wall has replaced the old barbed wire fence at Organ Pipe. The towering steel barrier cuts through the Unesco reserve like a rust-colored suture. \u201cIt\u2019s this incredible scar,\u201d said Kevin Dahl, a senior program manager at the National Parks Conservation Association, describing the wall that snakes its way through a pristine track of Sonoran desert, dwarfing the giant cacti that give this dessert its name. \u201cWhat was once a connected landscape is now a dissected one.\u201d That dissection is now a reality across much of the US border. It is a landscape increasingly defined by walls, roads, fences and associated border infrastructure that is fragmenting critically protected habitats, desecrating sacred cultural sites and threatening numerous endangered species in some of the most biodiverse and unique places in North America. \u201cBorder construction has had a huge impact on some of the most remote and biodiverse landscapes on the continent,\u201d said Dan Millis, a campaigner at the Sierra Club. \u201cThe Trump administration is taking it even further.\u201d Read more here: \u2018An incredible scar\u2019: the harsh toll of Trump\u2019s 400-mile wall through national parks Here\u2019s a quick handy run-down of who is out and about where today\u2026 Sen. Lindsey Graham is among the first of many tributes we can probably expect to see today from US political figures to Sean Connery. The James Bond actor has died, aged 90. We\u2019ve had voting in space, we\u2019ve had standing in long lines in the rain in Brooklyn, and we\u2019ve had a pregnant woman in labor stopping off to vote before she goes to hospital. And now remote islands. Katy Kelleher and Greta Rybus report for us that there are 70 active voters on Matinicus Island, 20 miles off the Maine coast\u2026 According to residents, people here are more likely to talk about topics that immediately affect their remote community \u2013 including and especially the weather \u2013 than the nebulous, divisive world of politics. \u201cPeople don\u2019t discuss it much,\u201d says a seventh-generation Matinicus lobsterman who is particularly passionate about environmental issues that affect his trade. \u201cWe know who the Trump supporters are, and people like me who aren\u2019t, we aren\u2019t going to change their minds,\u201d he says. When you live on an island, it\u2019s important to be able to get along with your neighbor. You never know when you might need their help. Read more here: \u2018I hope it makes a difference\u2019: voters on remote Maine island cast their ballot A very quick snap here \u2013 US forces carried out a rescue operation in northern Nigeria to recover an American citizen being held by \u201carmed men\u201d on Saturday, the Pentagon said. \u201cThis American citizen is safe and is now in the care of the US Department of State,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement, adding that no military personnel were injured in the operation. There\u2019s a little more detail here from Fox News\u2019 Pentagon correspondent Lucas Tomlinson: Kamala Harris is in the same position on the other side of the ticket to Mike Pence. She\u2019ll make history as the first woman, the first Black American and the first Asian American to hold the country\u2019s second highest office if Joe Biden wins, and she will immediately be in a strong position to run for the top job four years from now. Given his age, the 77-year-old Biden is not expected to seek a second term. \u201cHarris always made the most sense as a running mate for Biden because she had the ability to help him unify the Democratic coalition across racial and generational lines and was able to spike base enthusiasm,\u201d said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Accusations from progressives that Harris did not do enough to investigate police shootings and wrongful conviction cases when she was California\u2019s attorney general helped doom her own presidential run, but have surfaced little during her time as Biden\u2019s running mate. The Trump campaign, notes James Oliphant for Reuters, have sought to paint Harris instead as more of a tool of the Democratic left who would wield power and influence behind the scenes in a Biden presidency. As the Senate\u2019s only Black woman, Harris emerged this year as a leading voice on racial justice and police reform after Minneapolis police killed African-American man George Floyd in May. She marched with protesters on the streets of Washington and won over some liberal skeptics. Asked on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last month why, given Biden\u2019s age, he believed Harris would be ready to step into the presidency if something happened to him, the presidential candidate rapidly fired off five reasons. \u201cNumber one, her values. Number two, she is smart as a devil, and number three, she has a backbone like a ramrod. Number four, she is really principled. And number five, she has had significant experience in the largest state in the Union in running the justice department that*s only second in size to the United States Justice Department. And obviously, I hope that never becomes a question,\u201d he said. Jeff Mason and Sonya Hepinstall at Reuters have this look ahead at the future for vice president Mike Pence \u2013 whatever Tuesday\u2019s election holds. They point out that Pence, 61, will be catapulted into a group of front-runners for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination as soon as the 2020 results are known. Pence has been one of the few constants in Trump\u2019s tumultuous White House and has kept his boss\u2019s confidence by being careful never to step out of the president\u2019s shadow. He has been content to play a largely behind-the-scenes White House role, eschewing Trump\u2019s propensity for drama. His style, however is much different from that of his boss. He is calm rather than volcanic, and deeply religious. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order,\u201d Pence has said. He has always been careful to praise Trump and hew to his positions, even in closed-door meetings when the president is absent, and often says the job is \u201cthe greatest privilege of my life.\u201d Critics say he effectively validates Trump\u2019s often erratic behavior by quietly accepting the president\u2019s combative style. If Pence runs for president in 2024, he could face other Trump acolytes such as secretary of state Mike Pompeo and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley in the Republican race What he will not be able to do is separate himself from Trump\u2019s agenda. Reducing taxes and regulation, advancing anti-abortion policies, and transforming the judiciary with conservative judges and Supreme Court justices are among the policy changes of which Pence is most proud. But perhaps the greatest obstacle to Pence\u2019s further political advancement is that he oversaw the US response to the coronavirus pandemic as head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. That brief - despite being hailed as a success by the administration - has not gone well. The president is up and tweeting about his taxes. He\u2019s repeatedly promised to release his tax returns, although is yet to do so. It\u2019s all about the swing states. If you want to keep an eye on the latest polling numbers as we close in on Election Day itself, then we have our elections polls tracker which is looking at 8 states which could hold the key to the big night. The current state of play is that Biden has a significant lead in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden is also ahead in Florida, North Carolina, Arizona and Iowa \u2013 but those much narrower leads are within the grasp of Trump because of the margin for error in the figures. Trump leads in Ohio. More detail here: US election polls tracker: who is leading in swing states, Trump or Biden? Kentucky reported a near-record number of new coronavirus cases Friday as the surging outbreak continued sending more people to hospitals, Gov. Andy Beshear said. \u201cThis is a dangerous time. We\u2019re moving the wrong way,\u201d the Democratic governor said as he urged Kentuckians to wear masks in public to protect themselves and those around them. Beshear reported 1,941 new Covid-19 cases the second-highest statewide daily total since the pandemic began, and 15 more virus-related deaths. The state\u2019s positivity rate reached 6.19%, the highest level since May 6, he said. Associated Press report that the recent surge has led to rising hospitalizations. On Friday, there were 974 patients hospitalized in Kentucky due to the virus, the governor said, noting the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care rose to 241. \u201cRemember, the more cases, the more people in the hospital, the more people in the ICU and the more people who die,\u201d Beshear said. Total statewide Covid-19 cases surpassed 105,000, and the virus-related death toll reached at least 1,476. The latest deaths announced included people ranging in ages from 39 to 91. There are several different counts of how many cases of coronavirus the US has, and this morning the Reuters tally set an all-time global high for cases recorded in a 24-hour period, with just over 100,000 new infections on Friday, eclipsing its previous record of 91,000 the day before. The daily caseload of 100,233 surpasses the 97,894 cases reported by India on a single day in September. The US has exceeded its previous single-day record of 77,299 cases registered in July five times in the past ten days. The number of daily infections reported in the last two days suggests the country is reporting more than one new case every second. The US has a rate of about 28,100 cases per million people, which places it about 14th in the world for prevalence. The New York Times keeps an alternative tally, and they give yesterday\u2019s figure as 98,859. This is, they record, 42% higher than the number of daily new cases was 14 days ago. For consistency, on this live blog we\u2019ve been using the figures from the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which put the number of new US cases yesterday at 99,321. National Nurses United (NNU), the largest organization of registered nurses in the US, has put out a statement highly critical of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. They\u2019ve called on him to withdraw his threats against El Paso County officials for ordering stronger coronavirus measures. NNU Executive Director Bonnie Castillo condemned Paxton\u2019s \u201cappalling and unconscionable\u201d threat of exploring \u201call legal actions\u201d aimed at reversing an order to close non-essential businesses in the area, which is suffering one of the highest hospitalisation rates in the whole of the US. Castillo\u2019s letter stated that \u201cour members are literally putting their lives in jeopardy struggling to keep up with this crisis\u201d and goes on to say \u201cwe understand the critical importance of every step that is taken to reduce the spread of this virus.\u201d Trisha Garcia reported for us earlier in the week on the Covid crisis that has engulfed the border city. Talking of those possible Trump routes to victory, Tim Murtaugh, the director of comms for the Trump campaign, is getting very sportsball on Twitter this morning with CBS about whether the candidates are playing offense or defense in the last few days of the campaign. He\u2019s suggesting that Biden is trying to shore up usually safe Democratic areas, while Trump is on the attack. Niall Stanage, over at the Hill, says Donald Trump is very clearly the underdog in Tuesday\u2019s election, but still has several narrow but plausible paths to victory. Trump\u2019s simplest and easiest route to victory this year is to hold onto Florida and Pennsylvania, both of which he won in 2016. Florida is, as usual, a tight race \u2014 Biden led there by 1.2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average on Friday afternoon. Biden\u2019s polling lead in Pennsylvania is bigger, at 3.6 percentage points \u2014 but that\u2019s hardly an invincible margin, especially if state-level polls are off as they were in 2016. The president has three events scheduled for Pennsylvania on Saturday. If Trump won Florida and Pennsylvania, he could afford to lose two key states, Michigan and Wisconsin, so long as he held onto the other states that he won in 2016 \u2014 including Arizona, where he is under significant pressure. This scenario gives Republicans hope, despite all the polls in which the president is trailing. Read it here: The Hill \u2013 Trump retains narrow path to victory Republicans have attempted to make an election issue out of damage to US cities from the overwhelmingly peaceful Black Lives Matters during the summer and into the fall. Lois Beckett reports on a new report looking at the human cost \u2013 finding that so far at least 25 Americans were killed during protests and political unrest in 2020. It\u2019s a worrying portent for the election to come. The new data on fatalities and violence at American protests comes from a database created by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a nonprofit, working in collaboration with a group of researchers at Princeton. ACLED, a widely-cited source for data on civilian casualties in Yemen, has been a nonpartisan monitor of protests and violence in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America, and launched its US Crisis Monitor in July, citing concerns over hate crimes and rising political violence. ACLED found that the overwhelming majority of the more than 9.000 Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place across the US after the killing of George Floyd have been peaceful. News reports at the height of demonstrations over Floyd\u2019s killing cited dozens of deaths in connection with protests, but many of those turned out to be examples of deadly crimes carried out in the vicinity of protests, rather than directly related to the demonstrations themselves, the researchers concluded. ACLED\u2019s dataset only focuses on political violence. Most of the protesters killed this year were shot to death, and many of the incidents involved confrontations at protests that escalated and turned deadly when at least one of the people involved had a gun. Read more here: At least 25 Americans were killed during protests and political unrest in 2020 The Biden campaign have put out a reminder to vote this morning, stressing \u201cThis is your chance to be a part of history\u201d. There\u2019s still some concern from Democratic organisers that it could be the wrong type of history. I mentioned earlier their worries over turn-out in Florida [see 6:22]. These will not have been aided by concerns raised after House Democratic Leader Kionne McGhee tweeted yesterday a video from a \u201cconcerned postal worker\u201d who told his team \u201cmail-in ballots are within these piled up in bins on the floor. Mail has been sitting for over week!\u201d The clip is being widely shared on social media, and has led to State Attorney Kathy Rundle issuing a statement that \u201call postal distribution centers be audited\u201d. There were Black Lives Matter protests and vigils last night for Kevin Peterson Jr, a 21-year-old Black man who was killed by police on Thursday. Mourners gathered in Hazel Dell, about 12 miles (19km) north of Portland. Hundreds of people gathered for the vigil Friday evening, report the Associated Press, with some holding signs reading, \u201cHonk for Black lives. White silence is violence\u201d and \u201cScream his name\u201d. Mac Smiff, an organizer of Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, said he knows Peterson\u2019s sister and spent more than five hours at the scene. \u201cThere was a ton of grief, a ton of grief. He\u2019s 21 and has a baby, an infant,\u201d Smiff said. \u201cThey\u2019re not sure what happened, why the encounter took place. Everyone was extremely disheveled and confused.\u201d Jake Thompson, a high school acquaintance of Peterson, said he took photos at the wedding of Peterson\u2019s parents in Portland in 2018. On Friday, he posted a black-and-white photo of Peterson in a suit and bow tie. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep much last night,\u201d he said Friday. Later, tensions flared between left- and right-wing protesters. Video recorded by journalists in a parking lot showed two groups of people shouting at each other. Some armed demonstrators gathered near a building which they told reporters they were protecting. A group of hundreds of protesters later marched through downtown Vancouver, Washington. Federal agents dressed in riot gear surrounded a building warning people that trespassing on federal property would result in arrest. Authorities declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse. In a statement, Clark County Sheriff Chuck Atkins said a joint city-county narcotics taskforce was conducting an investigation just before 6pm Thursday and chased a man into the parking lot of a bank, where he fired a gun at them. A firearm was recovered at the scene, Atkins said. \u201cI can say that our agency is grieving as is the Peterson family and the community,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cAs the community grieves, I call for there to be a respectful and dignified observance of the loss of life in this matter. There is always the potential for misinformation, doubt and confusion - and there may be those who wish to sow seeds of doubt.\u201d The Oregonian reported that Peterson was on the phone with his partner, Olivia Selto, at the time he was shot. Selto said Peterson was running during the phone call and then she heard multiple gunshots before the line went silent. She said she didn\u2019t know the circumstances that led to the fatal encounter. If you are currently getting anxious about Tuesday\u2019s result \u2013 or whenever it finally comes \u2013 then you could cast an eye over our election builder to either reassure yourself, or give yourself an additional Halloween fright. Pick which states are going to opt for Trump, and which will opt for Biden, and build your way to the 270 electoral college votes needed to find the man being inaugurated as president of the United States on Wednesday 20 January 2021. CNN reports that Democrats are uneasy about the higher Republican turnout in an important Florida county. Florida is worth 29 electoral college votes, and the winner of the state has ended up in the White House in the last six elections. Republicans in Florida\u2019s most populous county, Miami-Dade, are turning out to vote at a somewhat higher percentage than Democrats \u2013 causing uneasiness among some Democratic operatives. Nearly 63% of the 428,000 registered Republicans in the county have voted so far, whereas about 56% of the county\u2019s 634,000 registered Democrats have voted to date, according to state data. About 225,000 people with no party affiliation have also already voted in the county. While more Democrats than Republicans have voted overall in Miami-Dade, the county is seen by Democrats as a region Joe Biden must win by wide margins in order to offset voting in the state\u2019s predominantly red regions. Steve Schale, a veteran Democratic Florida strategist, said that Black voters in the county tend to vote in-person closer to election day, so he expects a bump in turnout over the coming weekend. Democratic data consultant Matt Isbell said he\u2019s seeing a \u201clagging factor\u201d among Democratic Hispanic voters in Miami Dade. \u201cI don\u2019t have a good answer for why that might be. But that is certainly a factor at the moment that is giving Democrats a lot of worry,\u201d Isbell said. Read more here: CNN \u2013 Democrats uneasy about higher Republican turnout in important Florida county Delivery of first class mail in several Michigan cities remains much slower than usual during the two weeks preceding the election, a test of the local postal system found. The Guardian sent about 150 first class letters between locations in Detroit, Ann Arbor and Hamtramck, three Democratic strongholds in the critical battleground state. The mail was sent to mimic the route that a ballot would take from a mailbox to a city clerk\u2019s office in the same municipality. About 83% of the mail arrived on time. But the service was much worse in Detroit where about 36% of letters arrived at least three days late, and one Detroit letter remains unaccounted for. Detroit delays could spell trouble for Democratic candidates and the Biden campaign. About 170,000 Detroiters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, have requested absentee ballots ahead of the election. Trump previously won the state by just over 10,000 votes, and a Michigan judge recently ruled that mail-in ballots arriving after election day will not count. The Detroit city clerk exacerbated the situation by failing to send out 70,000 absentee ballots until the election\u2019s final weeks. Before the pandemic, and before changes were made by the Trump-appointed postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, this summer, the United States Postal Service posted on-time delivery rates of around 95%. But new cost-cutting strategies, including the removal of sorting machines at the nation\u2019s largest mail processing center in Pontiac, have slowed distribution. The on-time delivery rate in the Guardian\u2019s test is in line with the latest data from the postal service, which put its on-time rate in Detroit as low as 52% during a recent three-day period. The national rate was at 82% for a week-long period ending on 16 October, though it has been much lower in key swing states. Read more of Tom Perkins\u2019 report here: Critical mail delays hit swing states ahead of US election Dr Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious-diseases physician and an associate professor at the Boston University School of Medicine, is another medical professional to appear on the airwaves in the wake of Trump\u2019s comments. She said: As a frontline healthcare worker I have a few choice words to say to that malicious lie that I unfortunately can\u2019t say on national television. Just to share the heartbreak of my fellow healthcare workers going through this process, let me start by saying, no, doctors do not profit by listing someone as being Covid-positive on a death certificate. In fact, most doctors I know have seen cuts to their salaries, or potentially no increases. Our hospitals suffer major financial losses. The American Hospital Association says that hospitals are likely to lose $323bn by the end of 2020, because when there is a big surge, we have to stop all other services. Here in the north-east when we saw that, we actually had to furlough healthcare workers, because all the elective surgeries and everything else were put on hold. So this is really damning, and it\u2019s actually, as someone who\u2019s now anticipating our hospitals getting full again, and watching my co-healthcare workers suffer through this in Wisconsin and the midwest, it just breaks my heart. You can watch the clip here: MSNBC \u2013 Dr Bhadelia debunks Trump claim: doctors don\u2019t profit from listing patients as Covid-positive With coronavirus rising across the United States, Andy Sullivan writes for Reuters on how Trump is spending the closing days of his re-election campaign criticizing public officials and medical professionals who are trying to beat it back, rather than coming up with a national strategy to combat it. Trump delivered a closing message to the midwest that promised an economic revival and a vaccine to combat the pandemic, but that slice of optimism was delivered with great heapings of grievance \u2013 directed at Democratic rival Joe Biden and plenty of other people who aren\u2019t on Tuesday\u2019s ballot. He told reporters he was not concerned that supporters who flock to his events might contract the virus, even though he, his family and many White House staffers have battled the disease in recent weeks. The president criticized Democratic officials in Minnesota for enforcing social-distancing rules that limited his rally to 250 people. \u201cIt\u2019s a small thing, but a horrible thing,\u201d he said. And he mocked the Fox News host Laura Ingraham for wearing a mask as she attended his rally. Seeing her, the president said: \u201cI can\u2019t recognize you. Is that a mask? No way, are you wearing a mask? I\u2019ve never seen her in a mask. Look at you. Laura, she\u2019s being very politically correct. Whoa!\u201d Trump warned voters that Biden would prohibit Americans from celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays and other special events if he wins office. Biden, who has accused Trump of giving up in the fight against the disease, has by contrast sharply limited crowd sizes at events or restricted supporters to their vehicles. Speaking in Milwaukee on Friday, he delivered his remarks while wearing a medical mask. \u201cThe only thing that can tear America apart is America itself, and that\u2019s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing,\u201d he said. The US has suffered its worst week for new infections of the entire Covid-19 pandemic just days ahead of the election Scientists have sounded alarms about unabated Covid-19 spread across the midwest, a spread that has the potential to create even more devastation this winter if nothing is done to control the virus. And political divisions are fueling the surge. \u201cThere were so many red flags early on that made us vulnerable from day one,\u201d said Natalia Linos, a social epidemiologist who ran in a Democratic primary in Massachusetts this fall and is executive director of the Harvard FXB Center for Health and Human Rights. \u201cWe were worried, and it showed from day one this has been a political failure.\u201d As key swing states such as Wisconsin are experiencing \u201ccrisis levels\u201d of Covid-19 infections, it has \u201cdriven people further into their camps\u201d, said Katherine J Cramer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and author of The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker. \u201cThere\u2019s still very strong support for President Trump here, and I think among his supporters they think he\u2019s done a great job handling the pandemic,\u201d said Cramer. \u201cThen, the opposite is the case for people who are leaning toward Joe Biden,\u201d she said about the Democratic presidential candidate. This week marked the worst week in terms of new infections of the entirety of the pandemic in the US, breaking 500,000 new cases for the first time, according to the Covid Tracking Project. More tests are coming back positive in 47 states, and hospitalizations are climbing in 39 states. More than 1,000 people are dying a day on average, but deaths have not risen as fast as new cases, because they are considered a \u201clagging indicator\u201d. It often takes weeks between a positive test, hospitalization, death and reporting for victims of Covid-19. Read more from Jessica Glenza\u2019s report here: Americans go to the polls as US suffers worst week for coronavirus infections One of the medical professionals to respond was Dr Ashish Jha, who was asked about Trump\u2019s comments on MSNBC. After being played the clip of what the president had said, Dr Jha replied. I don\u2019t know where to begin. First of all it\u2019s offensive. Second, attacking frontline health workers who have been saving American lives, despite this botched public health response, is doubly offensive. And then it\u2019s just wrong. Right, doctors don\u2019t get a single extra cent. Now, hospitals do get reimbursed a little bit more if it\u2019s a Covid pneumonia versus a non-Covid pneumonia, but they don\u2019t go around committing large scale fraud. You have to test people, you have to show it. And that was, by the way, designed, and it was a law passed and signed by this president, because we know it takes more money to take care of patients with Covid. Hospitals have to pay for PPE, because the federal government sure isn\u2019t going to provide it. And so what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken a policy intervention that was reasonable, and turned it into an attack on American doctors and nurses, and it is really beyond the pale. Dr Jha is dean of the Brown University school of public health. You can watch his response here: MSNBC \u2013 Dr Jha on Trump\u2019s claim that doctors are Inflating Covid deaths for money Hi, and welcome to our live coverage as the election campaign enters its last weekend. Here\u2019s a quick catch-up on where we are, and what we might see today. The US surpassed 9 million cases of coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins University, 9,043,957 Americans have been diagnosed with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. There are surges in dozens of states. Trump falsely claimed doctors are diagnosing more cases of coronavirus to bolster their paychecks. \u201cOur doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid. You know that, right? I mean, our doctors are very smart people,\u201d Trump said at his rally in Michigan. In reality, health experts say the US death toll is likely to undercount how many Americans have died of coronavirus. Joe Biden and Donald Trump both campaigned in the midwest, with just four days to go until election day. Trump stopped in Michigan and Biden in Iowa, and they held starkly different events in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Trump criticized the supreme court for upholding an absentee ballot extension in North Carolina. The president said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d that the justices ruled to allow North Carolina election officials to count ballots as long as they are postmarked by election day. Twitter updated its policies around hacked materials, lifting restrictions that were placed on the account of the New York Post after it published a controversial Hunter Biden story a few weeks ago. Joe Biden will be in Detroit today at a campaign event attended by Barack Obama and Stevie Wonder. Donald Trump has four scheduled \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 campaign stops in Pennsylvania today: Newtown, Reading, Butler and Montoursville. You can join Guardian journalists Jonathan Freedland, Kenya Evelyn, David Smith and Sarah Churchwell online to chat about the election results in an online event next week. Find out more about our 4 November plans and book tickets here. I\u2019m Martin Belam, and I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours \u2013 you can drop me a line at martin.belam@theguardian.com Here\u2019s a clip of those comments from the president yesterday which have outraged members of the medical profession in the US. At his rally, Donald Trump said: Our excess mortality rate is 42% lower than Europe. They\u2019ve kept saying, Germany! Germany! Germany! First of all they have different ways of counting. You know in Germany, if you have a bad heart and you\u2019re ready to die. Or if you have cancer and you\u2019re going to be dying soon. And you catch Covid, that happens, we mark it down to Covid. You know, our doctors get more money if somebody dies from Covid. You know that, right? I mean our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is, they say, I\u2019m sorry, but you know everybody dies of Covid. But in Germany and other places, if you have a heart attack, or if you have cancer, you\u2019re terminally ill, you catch Covid, they say you died of cancer, you died of a heart attack. With us? When in doubt, choose Covid. Now, it\u2019s true. Now, they\u2019ll say \u2018oh, it\u2019s terrible what he said\u2019, but that\u2019s true.
