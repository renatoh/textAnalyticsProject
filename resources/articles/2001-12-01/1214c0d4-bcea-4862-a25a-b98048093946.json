There is an image that being the partner of an international sportsperson is all about visiting exotic locations, staying in five-star hotels and attending glitzy cocktail parties. But the more realistic picture is of a wife struggling to bring up a young family on her own while believing that her partner is enjoying all those luxuries. I'd be lying if I said there weren't such gatherings, and at such functions there are always many attractive people delighted to meet you. Partners are aware of this from previous occasions they have attended with you and it is understandable that at times they will be adding two and two and getting four. Kiss-and-tell stories in the newspapers also tend to add a bit of an edge to your phone calls from the other side of the world. Though the vast majority of your time is actually spent playing or training, waiting in airport departure lounges and staring at the four walls of your hotel room, it is hard to convince partners that you are not permanently frequenting the bars of Sydney, Cape Town or Auckland. Cricket, along with rugby, must be the worst sport for time spent away from home; international football teams, for instance, generally make only fleeting visits. My first tour to Australia in 1990-91 lasted four months and explains why the England players have been putting the England and Wales Cricket Board under pressure to shorten its tours. To be fair it has tried to do so, but getting the balance right between time away and time to prepare properly for a Test series is a precarious juggling act. In 1998 I spent only 120 nights in my own bed and I can understand, from the many rollickings from my long-suffering wife, that living with an international cricketer is not easy. It never has been and never will be. Each time I return home after a period away I seem to mess up the well oiled routine she has devised. She has also realised that she can live without me, which is a worrying thought. At home I am often reminded by her that she is not a waiter, nor room service, and that if I want something transferred from the kitchen to my comfortable armchair \"you can bloody well get it yourself\". As a player you also become a pretty insensitive soul. After receiving stick from hostile crowds, and negative media comment, you tend to develop a thicker skin, which can make you hard to communicate with. To reach the highest level in the first place you have to be single-minded, even selfish. Competition for places is fierce and there is always someone ready and happy to take your place. You come to view yourself as the most important person in the world and your family's main role as supporting you. Careers generally last less than 15 years and you are aware that your earning potential while still a player is at its highest. You get only one crack at it and you don't want to spend the rest of your life saying \"What if?\" It is inevitable, then, that there is a real feeling of making it count while it lasts and not saying no to anything. Some partners are content with playing second fiddle but others get fed up with the solitude and being known to everyone as the wife of, say, Angus Fraser. They want to be recognised in their own right and that can come as a shock to the supposed star of the family. But it is not only the one left behind who feels the pain of separation. I have found leaving my two children harder each time I have gone on tour. I don't want to miss them growing up but there seems no other way of maintaining our lifestyle financially. It is not all doom and gloom, though. The good things that have happened to me as a player far outweigh the bad. A career as a professional cricketer is something I can thoroughly recommend. Being pretty well paid as well as having someone pick up the expenses while you travel around the world with your mates, playing a game you love, is not a bad way of spending 15 years of your life. The downside is the stress and strain that, at times, makes the grass seem greener on the other side. Inevitably when this happens your problems come into the public eye. But I still wish I was 10 years younger and could go through it all over again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
