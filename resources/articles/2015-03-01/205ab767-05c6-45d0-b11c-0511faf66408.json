The 20-year-old has been granted leave to miss next week\u2019s friendly in Italy. Roy Hodgson, who is considering handing Harry Kane a full debut in partnership with Wayne Rooney in Friday\u2019s game at Wembley, is aware Sterling has been playing recently despite requiring regular injections in a toe injury. The England manager\u2019s relationship with Brendan Rodgers has been strained in the past over the fitness of Sterling and Daniel Sturridge, who missed five months this season after sustaining a thigh injury in training at St George\u2019s Park. Liverpool had insisted that setback could have been prevented if the striker had been granted his usual two-day post-match recovery period, while Sterling had apparently complained of fatigue ahead of England\u2019s win in Estonia in October, prompting his omission from the starting lineup. With that in mind, Hodgson had promised to listen to his former club\u2019s concerns before naming his 24-man party for the two fixtures just before Easter. He ended up selecting a quartet of Liverpool players, though Sturridge and Adam Lallana have since returned to Merseyside with hip and groin complaints respectively. Now Sterling is set to join them back at Melwood at the weekend with an appearance against Lithuania to be his 50th game of the campaign to date. Hodgson, speaking to Talksport on Tuesday night, admitted he expects withdrawals from his squad after Friday\u2019s fixture. \u201cPeople may judge us on Italy rather than Lithuania but that is dangerous because apart from all the players I have lost through injury, I fear we will lose a few more,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready there are one or two who I know won\u2019t be able to join us against Italy because of the problems they are dealing with at the moment. I fear, on this occasion in particular, it won\u2019t be as strong a team as maybe I would like to have put out. But the qualifier is still the priority even though, on paper, Italy are a stronger team to play than Lithuania.\u201d Quite how the other clubs competing with Liverpool \u2013 who expect to have Lallana and Sturridge fit for the resumption of the Premier League \u2013 for a top-four place react to seeing another of the Merseysiders\u2019 key players released early remains to be seen. Arsenal, who have Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs and Danny Welbeck in Hodgson\u2019s squad, welcome Rodgers\u2019 team to the Emirates for a 12.45pm kick-off four days after the friendly in Turin. Manchester United have four players involved while Tottenham Hotspur have five. Hodgson arrived at training at St George\u2019s Park on Tuesday clasping a piece of paper on which he had laid out a prospective team, with the names \u201cKane\u201d and \u201cRooney\u201d ringed up front. Sturridge\u2019s absence has limited the manager\u2019s options slightly but, while Welbeck has five goals in four qualifying ties this term and has excelled in this England set-up, Kane is expected to gain a first senior cap at some stage against Lithuania. The Spurs forward had only made one Premier League start this season the last time England played, with his consistent excellence at club level since having earned him this opportunity. Hodgson laughed off suggestions the names on his scrap of paper had been a definitive lineup for Friday. \u201cThat would be dangerous to assume,\u201d he said, but the manager has been impressed by Kane\u2019s impact. \u201cIt is fantastic what he has done. It is very tough for a young player to come into a top team like Tottenham, with the demands and expectations that brings, and to shoulder aside people like (Emmanuel) Adebayor and (Roberto) Soldado and make the place your own. To keep your place and score a lot of goals... that is some achievement. I am delighted for him and, if he gets his chance to play in these games, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t let anyone down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
