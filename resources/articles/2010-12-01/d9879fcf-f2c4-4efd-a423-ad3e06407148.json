The Seasiders have already been forced to postpone two home games, against Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, while they reversed the season opener against Wigan Athletic, playing it at the DW Stadium rather than at home as scheduled because Bloomfield Road had not been brought up to Premier League standards in time. Wigan's visit is now set for 16 April and comes as part of a run of four home fixtures in a row for Blackpool during the month. The sequence could be swelled if the Tottenham game or even the one against Liverpool is rearranged for around that time. United's visit has already been rescheduled for Tuesday 25 January, one of the contingency dates earmarked by the Premier League for rearranged fixtures. Another is 12 January, and one more could be 18 or 19 January, which has been set aside for FA Cup third-round replays but could come into force if teams do not have a replay. Complicating matters is the fact that Tottenham and Liverpool have midweek European commitments, which resume in February. Blackpool have suggested that their game against Liverpool is in doubt as, much to the irritation of the Premier League, they did not invest a portion of the windfall that they secured on promotion from the Championship last May in undersoil heating. The United game on 4 December was postponed due to a frozen pitch and not because of concerns over supporters' safety in the cold weather. \"We can almost certainly guarantee the pitch will be playable [on Boxing Day] but it is the prevailing conditions once the covers have been removed and whether the pitch will freeze before the end of the game taking place,\" said Karl Oyston, the Blackpool chairman. It would not be difficult to imagine the reaction of the teams that are vying for Premier League survival were Blackpool to enjoy an extended run of home fixtures towards the end of the season. As it is, the switching of the Wigan fixture that has led to their having four straight home games has already caused eyebrows to be raised. Blackpool, who sit 10th in a congested division, have delighted the neutral with their brave and expansive football but they have had a few teething problems with the Premier League. Not only was Bloomfield Road not ready and lacking under-soil heating but the League was forced to arbitrate in a row between the club and their players over bonuses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
