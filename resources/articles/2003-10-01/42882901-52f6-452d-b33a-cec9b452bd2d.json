The positives were found in the retesting of 350 samples from the US championships in June and 100 later out-of-competition tests. \"This is a very sophisticated designer steroid created by very sophisticated chemists,\" said the USADA chief executive Terry Madden. Madden would not reveal how many athletes had tested positive for tetrahydrogestrinone (THG). But he said: \"I know of no other drug bust that is larger than this, involving the number of athletes we have involved, certainly in the anabolic steroid area.\" Several positive samples for modafinil also were found in the testing, Madden said. The world 100 and 200 metres champion Kelli White tested positive for the same stimulant at August's world championships and may lose her gold medals as a result. \"What we have uncovered appears to be intentional doping of the worst sort,\" Madden said. \"This is a conspiracy involving chemists, coaches and certain athletes using what they developed to be undetectable designer steroids to defraud their fellow competitors and the American and world public who pay to attend sports events.\" No names are likely to be released until December as the positive tests wind their way through US anti-doping procedures, Madden said. Madden said USADA learned of THG when a coach sent it a syringe containing a substance that the IOC-accredited laboratory in Los Angeles identified as a steroid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
