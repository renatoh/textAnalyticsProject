Monday's violence conjured up memories of a far more famous Hungarian uprising against Soviet tanks in 1956. Its 50th anniversary is to be celebrated next month and the demonstrators may have been trying to invoke heroic images of the anti-communist struggle, tarring the government by association with the Red Army. But the problems Hungary is facing are very modern ones, far removed from the era of cold war confrontation. Mr Gyurcsany insisted yesterday that he would not bow to opposition demands to resign and there were (bizarre) suggestions that he had even leaked his own remarks to a closed party meeting in order to underline his determination to press ahead with tough austerity measures. If true, that would certainly out a cynical new gloss on political spin: this April his Socialist and Free Democrat coalition became the first Hungarian government since communism ended in 1989 to retain power in an election. He campaigned then on promises of tax cuts, but instead imposed $4.6bn of tax increases and benefit cuts shortly after winning. The government said it had no choice, with a budget deficit of 10% of national income, the largest in the EU. Hopes for joining the eurozone, obligatory under the terms of Hungary's entry in the union's \"big bang\" expansion of 2004, have had to be put back to 2014 - part of a wider euro-slippage across east-central Europe - worrying investors and delaying the benefits the country could be reaping from approaching membership. Whatever happens next in this sordid saga on the Danube, no one should have been surprised that Hungary's economy is indeed in dire straits. The investment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this month rated Hungary as the riskiest of the world's emerging market investment destination. Other elements of the crisis include a credit boom, funded by heavy borrowing in foreign currencies, mainly euros and Swiss francs, creating dangerous vulnerability to exchange rate fluctuations. The IMF has been warning of the dangers of a wider eastern European financial crisis - Turkey and Serbia are similarly at risk and there are worries about others. With populist pressure growing over the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, to say nothing of Turkey to come, the EU itself looks alarmingly exposed. Critics of neo-liberal reforms point the finger at a process that began a decade ago with the floating of the Hungarian forint, budget austerity and mass privatisation. Those policies cut Hungary's then fiscal deficit and helped create the conditions for growth based on investment and exports. But instead of following up with reforms in healthcare, education and administration, both the Socialists and the now opposition Fidesz indulged in budget-busting populist handouts on benefits, public sector salaries and energy subsidies. Hungary is not just an \"emerging market\", but a country whose turbulent history has marked it very deeply - hence the suspicion that Monday's rioting was intended to touch the symbolic nerve of 1956. In this polarised atmosphere, Mr Gyurcsany, a communist youth leader turned wealthy businessman, is perceived as an opportunist who got rich thanks to the injustices of an undemocratic system. Viktor Orban of Fidesz has a less ambiguous record as an anti-communist activist, but he too has an abrasive style. Both men were elected to high office in a modern European democracy where leaders should not be allowed to lie and get away with it. In politics as in private life, honesty is not only the best policy, it is the only one that works."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
