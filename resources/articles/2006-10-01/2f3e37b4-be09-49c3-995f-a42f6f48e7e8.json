The reputation of Liverpool's fans was severely tarnished during the FA Cup tie in February, the Kop making siren noises and chanting mockingly as Smith was taken off on a stretcher. Even worse came when his ambulance was attacked outside the stadium. Bricks and bottles were thrown and there was a cursory attempt to overturn the vehicle. Yet Smith has since been inundated with messages from Liverpool fans, many apologising for what happened. \"I want to thank everyone at Liverpool,\" he said in a statement last night. \"Unfortunately people drag up other parts of that day, in particular what happened when I was in the ambulance. But that was a few people out of a million. For every one person who did something like that there have been a million others, particularly at Liverpool, who have got in touch to wish me well.\" Smith is expected to be on the bench for Sunday's game and he intends to visit the Liverpool dressing room to thank the club's medical staff for their assistance. \"This is the first time I will be able to thank them in person,\" he said. \"The people at Liverpool, along with our own medical staff, got me off the pitch and sorted me out as quickly as possible. You can't put a price on things like that. \"If they hadn't acted as swiftly as they did then things may have been worse. I appreciate that so much and it will be nice coming face to face to say thanks. It got a little bit silly afterwards because so many people were talking about the incident with the ambulance and putting a negative aspect on everything but, from my point of view, I never even noticed what happened. I was so groggy I don't really remember anything of the ambulance journey so there are no negative feelings towards Liverpool from me. There is a rivalry but it is a good rivalry.\" Smith had been injured charging down a free-kick from John Arne Riise and he revealed that the Norwegian full-back had visited him in hospital. \"Most of the Liverpool players did, as did players from other clubs. Plus I got phone calls and letters and cards. Everyone has been fantastic. Sometimes you don't realise how much other people appreciate you.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
