Sadler's Wells, London EC1 Come the Christmas season, dance companies regret their limited age range: festive ballets, like pantos, require children and oldies. There's nothing more embarrassing than grown dancers frolicking in short pants and party frocks or youngsters affecting wrinkles and an arthritic stoop. Pina Bausch has gone for the real thing in a revision of her 1978 Kontakthof, now performed by the (mainly) over-65s. Though not intended as a Christmas show, its enforced conviviality is timely: these are people brought together to stave off loneliness. They meet in a bleak community centre that serves as a dance hall or cinema. They parade their attractions and inadequacies, trapped in a timeless limbo. The schmaltzy tunes date from the Twenties and Thirties; the outfits are more or less Fifties. What dates this generation, though, is the social convention of dancing in couples or as a unison group, situations ripe with the potential for humiliation. The original cast were members of Bausch's Wuppertal Tanztheater company, an international ensemble of dancers and actors. Their Kontakthof encounters were drawn from childhood memories of their parents' world and their own experience of auditioning as performers. The two leading women were wonderful, uninhibited Australians - Jo-Ann Endicott and Meryl Tankard, who cackled like kookaburras. The present cast are Wuppertal pensioners, not professionals: they are required to be themselves, while replicating the actions of their younger predecessors. Gains and losses almost cancel each other out in this age-shift. Bausch has given up control of a highly calculated theatre piece for the poignancy of well-worn bodies and genuine embarrassment. We're forced to examine whether we are laughing with game old girls or jeering at the deluded gents who lust after them. When performers nervously fumble for words, there's a worry they may have lost the plot; when they fall to the floor, they might not be able to scramble up again. They're a robust group or they wouldn't be on stage, but their theatrical timing is off and they don't own their stories. They're doggedly doing what they've been told, without the sardonic energy of the original performers. What they have instead is the melancholy of second childhood. The games they play are Bausch specialities: they go through the motions of pinching, slapping and groping each other like a half-forgotten playground ritual. Over three hours, however, their own personalities rub through, extraordinary in their ordinariness. By the time the repeated line dance comes round again, they have reclaimed their dignity. Bausch was right to trust them. Matthew Bourne's Nutcracker! is also a revival of an earlier work, with an exclamation mark to remind us that he has come a long way since 1992. Although he has worked with children in musicals (including Oliver!), he uses a grown-up cast for his Dickensian vision of Christmas. That way, he can give a knowingly ironic gloss to the show's message: greed and hypocrisy are bad, in adults as in children. His cast's observation of underage behaviour is acute. Clara (Etta Murfitt) and her fellow waifs and strays from Dr Dross's orphanage exhibit traits that will stay with them all their lives. Just like the old folk in Kontakthof , there's the brash show-off, the sensitive soul, the nerd, the practical joker, the cutie-pie. Clara herself is desperately needy, destined, you'd think, to be a loser. You would be wrong, of course, although her nightmare looks like coming true until the very last moments. Bourne has amplified his staging to make his new Nutcracker! a dance-driven show. In Act 1, to impress the orphanage governors, the foundlings are required to perform an exhaustive set of routines: Dalcroze eurythmics and health-and-beauty exercises, as well as social dances and the odd bit of tap. The scenario is put on hold until, after lights-out, the Nutcracker monster leads a children's crusade against oppression. Where anarchy should reign during the ensuing pillow-fight, the moves are so elaborate that the battle lumbers to a close. Tchaikovsky saves the day with his snowflake music and the act ends with a blissful skating scene, frozen smiles and poses conveying speed as the boys flap the girls' satin skirts. A coup de glace, it's the sweetest tableau in the show. Act 11 tries too hard. Anthony Ward's designs for the confectionery kingdom are wittily glutinous; like Barbie and Barbara Cart land, he believes you can't have too much pink. An overdose of sugar, though, corrodes the imagination. Bourne's choreographic ideas flag just when the score demands sustained flights of inspiration. Where he once got by on cheek and gleeful humour, he's now straining for effect - and his dancers aren't technically proficient enough to dazzle in their own right. Children will certainly revel in the orphans' antics and their finger-licking transformations in the second half. Adults may find their grins fading before the two hours are up.
