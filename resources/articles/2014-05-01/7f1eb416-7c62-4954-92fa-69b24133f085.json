Bale scored the second goal for Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team as they came from behind to beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 4-1 but he admitted the night could have ended badly for him after his three misses before Madrid scored. Sergio Ramos\u2019s goal in stoppage time took the game into extra time and Bale headed them into the lead with five minutes to go. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from past experience to keep going, forget about the chances you\u2019ve missed and keep persevering,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully I got the decisive goal. It was great to see it go in. I came here to play in big competitions and win trophies. This is what every footballer dreams of and it doesn\u2019t get any bigger in club football. Lifting that trophy is a feeling you can\u2019t describe and it will be a memory I will never forget.\u201d Atl\u00e9tico had taken a first-half lead through Diego God\u00edn\u2019s header but Ramos\u2019s header changed the entire complexion of the game and Bale\u2019s goal was quickly followed by a third from the substitute Marcelo before Cristiano Ronaldo made it four from the penalty spot. \u201cIncredible, what can I say? It was our aim from the start of the season,\u201d Ancelotti said after he moved alongside Liverpool\u2019s Bob Paisley as the only manager in history to win this competition three times. \u201cIt was difficult but I think we deserved it in the end. Gareth was very important. He had chances earlier in the match and his shooting was not good but, at the right moment, he was ready to score. Not just tonight, but all season, he has been very good and I\u2019m sure he will be even better next season.\u201d Bale, who also scored for Madrid in their Copa del Rey final victory against Barcelona, added: \u201cWe want to win more now. When that ball came over for my goal, I said to myself: \u2018Do not miss, do not miss\u2019. It was great to see it go in and the celebrations from the crowd showed how much it meant to them. It feels like we are living a dream. When we play our own football we win matches and it was just about attacking and keep doing what we do best. We believe in that and we believed if we kept doing it we would win.\u201d Ramos added: \u201cI think we are all heroes, it is a team effort and we can all now celebrate together. We have lived through a lot together and then we had to wait until the final minute to equalise. Now Lisbon is our home. It is a reward for all of the sacrifice and the fight that we have shown over the years.\u201d Diego Simeone, the Atl\u00e9tico manager, was sent off after the fourth goal for clashing with the Madrid defender Rapha\u00ebl Varane on the pitch in an unedifying end to the final. \u201cI\u2019ve told our players they shouldn\u2019t waste a single second being sad,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cThey gave everything and we finish the season with nine and a half as our mark. It was just that extra half we were missing.\u201d \u201cIt was a sad moment, tragic when they got the 1-1,\u201d said the Atl\u00e9tico midfielder Gabi. \u201cThey had few chances but they did better in extra time. We were very close but Madrid proved to be very strong.\u201d His team-mate Juanfran added: \u201cWe fought to the end but then Sergio Ramos caused problems with the goal. We will return. They won so they are the just winners but still we have won the league and got to the final of the Champions League.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
