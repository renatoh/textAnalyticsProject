The director is a comedy giant. The cast \u2013 including Dev Patel, Tilda Swinton and Peter Capaldi \u2013 is astonishing. The early reviews are raves, the trailer is one of the year\u2019s best, the source material is pretty solid. But what if you needed one last nudge to convince you to see it? Well, great news. The character posters of The Personal History of David Copperfield have just been revealed. That\u2019ll do it, surely. Because nothing is going to convince the everyman to invest in a cinema ticket like a big picture of Ben Whishaw looking vaguely consternated beneath a bad fringe, is it? Or a massive close-up picture of Peter Capaldi playing a jauntily coloured concertina, for that matter. What if I showed you a giant piece of paper announcing that Rosalind Eleazar plays Agnes in the film? You\u2019d walk right up to the cinema and queue up until January, wouldn\u2019t you? Of course you would. You can\u2019t hear news like that and just do nothing. To be clear, my issue has nothing to do with The Personal History of David Copperfield, although the only David Copperfield character poster worth anything at all is the one proclaiming \u201cHUGH LAURIE IS MR DICK\u201d, purely because I suspect that Laurie himself would quite like it framed on his wall. Instead, it\u2019s the medium that irks. I\u2019m getting sick of character posters. Who are they for? What point do they serve? Last week we were treated to a set of Little Women character posters. Now, not much could stop me from wanting to see the film, but the sight of the cast airbrushed and glowing like they\u2019ve just been Pompeiied by a uranium tsunami came awfully close. Truly, these are dreadful posters. Florence Pugh looks like she was dropped into a vat of Vaseline by a clumsy fool. Meryl Streep has the expression of someone exasperated by being the guinea pig for her second worst friend\u2019s camera\u2019s portrait mode. Laura Dern looks like how Laura Dern would look if she Pritt-Sticked an imported Laura Dern mask on top of her own face. And the same goes for Le Mans \u201966. \u201cJon Bernthal is Lee Iacocca\u201d. Great. Thanks for the information, Le Mans \u201966. Other types of poster I can understand. A teaser poster is usually the first piece of art that anyone will see of a film, which will obviously build anticipation. A main poster serves a number of important purposes: conveying tone, providing a visual shorthand for the film and \u2013 increasingly \u2013 serving as a calling card on streaming services. But character posters just tell us who plays what, even though the trailer and the main poster and IMDb and Wikipedia will have already comprehensively done that. Yes, it\u2019s a marketing technique. Yes, it might raise awareness of the film by a fraction of a degree. But I\u2019d argue that character posters can actually dilute the effectiveness of a movie campaign. The punch is lessened. The impact is diffused. There\u2019s no single image for everyone to look at, no one focal point for everyone to gather around. The root of the character poster seems to come from something called a personality poster, utilised by the studios a century ago. These didn\u2019t exist to promote a specific film necessarily, but to remind audiences of the big stars of the day, reused whenever they made a new movie. The Bags Unlimited blog uses Mary Pickford as an example. There is just a photo of Mary Pickford, to be passed around to spread the message that Mary Pickford exists. It worked wonders in 1919, but much less so now that the internet exists. The only successful character poster trailer campaign I can think of is the one for Avengers: Endgame this year, and that\u2019s because the MCU is a continuous soap opera rather than a series of standalone films. In theory it made no sense whatsoever \u2013 we knew who played who because we\u2019d spent a decade watching them \u2013 but by showing us every single character and reminding us which of them had died in Infinity War, the posters took on the equivalent of a \u201cPreviously on\u2026\u201d recap at the start of a television programme. In that context, it was allowable. But every single film doesn\u2019t need to mimic it. The Lion King didn\u2019t need to make a huge poster of a hornbill to remind us \u201cJOHN OLIVER is ZAZU\u201d. The Expendables 2 didn\u2019t need to hype itself up with a portrait of Scott Adkins captioned solely by the word \u201cADKINS\u201d. Nobody on Earth, I guarantee, was moved to watch Nymphomaniac because they saw a harrowing close-up of Nicolas Bro\u2019s face at the point of ejaculation. The Personal History of David Copperfield will do well enough as it is. Let\u2019s leave this silly character poster fad behind us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
