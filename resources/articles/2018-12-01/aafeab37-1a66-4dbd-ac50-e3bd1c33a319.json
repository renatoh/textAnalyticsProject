Mark Prince, a former boxer, receives an OBE for his work after the fatal stabbing of his 15-year-old son, Kiyan, a prodigious footballing talent, in 2006. The former WBO world light-heavyweight champion set up the Kiyan Prince Foundation to deliver his anti-knife, anti-gang message to thousands of pupils in London\u2019s schools. His I Have a Dream programme combines intensive boxing training sessions with weekly one-hour workshops on subjects such as gang life, knife crime and drug and substance abuse. He said: \u201cMy son lost his life, and this is what I can give back on behalf of my son. This is not about going around saying \u2018oh, I\u2019ve got an OBE,\u2019 because that doesn\u2019t really do anything for me when I go to the cemetery to visit my son.\u201d He said his award demonstrated \u201cthat people like us from our community can do great things and be recognised for the great things that we are trying to do for others\u201d. Stephen Addison, the founder of BoxUp Crime, receives a British Empire Medal for services to young people in Barking and Dagenham, where he helped spread a similar message. Following the loss of a close friend to gang violence, and after being involved in gangs himself, he turned his life around to work with young people teaching non-contact boxing skills in schools, pupil referral units and community centres in London, as well as mentoring. \u201cI feel very humble to get this award,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve lost seven kids in the space of a year that have been murdered. We\u2019ve seen 131 murders in London. And the reality is these young people, where we work and where we\u2019re from, they don\u2019t have access to hope, they don\u2019t get to see success, they don\u2019t get to see awards. \u201cSo, when I receive this award, it\u2019s not for me, it\u2019s for these young kids to show them that I\u2019ve come from the same mess as you. \u201cMy vision is to see young people all over London, all over the UK, to have opportunities to win awards like this, put suits on, forget about their past, forget about all the murders that they\u2019ve had to witness, and actually to bring the hope back to their communities\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
