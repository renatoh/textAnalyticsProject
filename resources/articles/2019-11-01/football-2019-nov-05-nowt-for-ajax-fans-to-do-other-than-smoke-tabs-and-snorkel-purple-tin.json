For example, their heroes won their very first Big Cup here, beating Ferenc Puskas\u2019 Panathinaikos in the 1971 final at the old Wembley. But they were also spanked 3-0 by Arsenal at Highbury in the semi-finals of Euro Vase in 1970. Then last year, they rocked up and walloped Spurs 1-0, a performance of such dominant swagger it initially appeared to be the epochal statement of champions in waiting, only to be rendered meaningless a week later when they touched collective cloth back in Amsterdam at the mere sight of Lucas Moura. Oh nee! Onze broek! So, it\u2019s been swings and roundabouts. Speaking of which, their supporters might have to look for a playground or park in which to while away the hours this evening when they once again visit England\u2019s capital. Perhaps take turns to have a go on the slide, or maybe just hang about and have some fags and cans. Because they sure as hell won\u2019t be watching their team take on Chelsea\u2019s Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea at the Frank Lampard Stadium in the London Borough of Hammersmith, Lampard &amp; Fulham. That\u2019s because Ajax were banned from selling tickets for the game after crowd bother at Valencia last month, something of a problem for the 2,000 supporters who had already booked their flights and digs. So now they\u2019ve got nowt to do, other than smoke tabs and snorkel Purple Tin. They could also hang about outside the shops, but having shelled out all that cash, and spent so much time travelling, ideally it\u2019d be better to find something more constructive, perhaps even football-related, to do. They had been planning to watch Leyton Orient v Brighton U21s, but that fixture\u2019s been moved specifically to avoid the hassle of accommodating hundreds of bored Dutch folk. That narrows down tonight\u2019s options considerably: other games close to the M25 include Wycombe\u2019s EFL Trophy tie with Fulham U21s and Hampton &amp; Richmond\u2019s National League South clash with Dartford. Either fixture would give the Ajax faithful a taste of the real England, away from the fake glitz and ersatz glamour of Big Cup. But then again, so would shotgunning tinnies of value cider in the park. In that sense, they can\u2019t lose tonight whatever they do, and whatever happens in the big game.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe mayor \u2026 should take legal action against [Balotelli] and all those who attack Verona by unjustly defaming it. It is no longer fair that Verona is put in the dock when, as in this case, nothing happened.\u201d Four local councillors release a statement denying Mario Balotelli suffered racist abuse from Hellas Verona fans. In other, reality-based news, the club have been handed a partial stadium ban over the abuse, and have banned the leader of their ultras until 2030 for saying that Balotelli \u201ccan never be completely Italian\u201d.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: Niko Kovac [Monday\u2019s Fiver]. Surely the Tritt in den Boden that he received would have sent him through a door marked mach eins rather than Do One?\u201d \u2013 Richard O\u2019Hagan (and 1,057 others). \u201cI think the point about fifth-favourite tea-timely email [Monday\u2019s letters] was that the reference came on Friday.

It\u2019s a little bit frustrating,\u201d Clarke seethed. Ryan Giggs is hopeful that Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey will be fit for their crunch Euro 2020 qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Hungary. \u201cI\u2019m in constant contact with [Gareth] and he feels confident that he\u2019ll be fit,\u201d Giggs chirruped. \u201cIt\u2019s just monitoring it this week, literally day by day.\u201d South Africa appear unlikely to extend their nation\u2019s recent sporting success at the Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations, after arriving in Egypt with just 12 players.

Shortbread McFiver is the frontrunner for both the vacant Hearts and Hibs jobs, after David Moyes said a return to fitba management was not on the cards. Poor Steve Morrow has been dropped by Arsenal again \u2013 this time as head of youth scouting after a shake-up of staff under the academy head, Per Mertesacker. Former \u00d6stersund chairman Daniel Kindberg has been sent to the big house for three years for funnelling public money into the Swedish club.
