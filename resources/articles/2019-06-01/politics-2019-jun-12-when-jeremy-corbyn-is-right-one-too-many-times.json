Labour needs both leavers and remainers, Journal, 6 June) may be regarded as a misfortune; to write two (Corbyn is right: equality beats social mobility, Journal, 12 June) within a week looks like carelessness! David Murray Wallington, Surrey \u2022 Len McCluskey admonishes Polly Toynbee for alienating people (Letters, 11 June). I would in turn urge him to reflect that every time he speaks or writes he alienates lifelong union members such as myself who resigned because of his attitude and that of Jeremy Corbyn.

Norman Miller Brighton, East Sussex \u2022 Well said, Katie Edwards.(Gerraway with accents, I\u2019m proud to speak Yorkshire, Journal, 10 June).

Then followed it up with \u201cshe\u2019s been on TV\u201d, which was true. \u201cITV?\u201d asked the dean\u2019s wife. \u201cNo, BBC2,\u201d I replied smugly. Mavis Curtis Oxford \u2022 I\u2019ve been trialling a reusable coffee cup at my breakfast table for over 50 years now and the results are extremely promising (Letters, 10 June).
