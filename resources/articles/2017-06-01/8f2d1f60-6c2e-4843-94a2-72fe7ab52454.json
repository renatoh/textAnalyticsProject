The 33-year-old, who retired in 2011, told his story to Outsports in an interview published on Tuesday. O\u2019Callaghan says he grew up in a conservative town and realized he was gay as a teenager. He described how his career, through high school and then into college and the NFL, was partly used to hide his sexuality. \u201cNo one is going to assume the big football player is gay,\u201d said O\u2019Callaghan, who was listed as 6ft 7in and 330lbs during his NFL career. \u201cIt\u2019s why a football team is such a good place to hide.\u201d O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s career was ended by injuries that still affect him today, and he says he planned to kill himself. \u201cI was abusing painkillers, no question,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helped with the pain of the injuries, and with the pain of being gay. I just didn\u2019t worry about being gay when I took the Vicodin. I just didn\u2019t worry ... I started spending all my money to put myself in a position where it would be impossible, or at least extremely difficult, to back out of killing myself.\u201d O\u2019Callaghan was helped by the support of staff at the Chiefs, including psychologist Susan Wilson and general manager Scott Pioli. \u201cAll I had ever done was think how bad the reaction would be,\u201d O\u2019Callaghan said. \u201cIt takes a lot more strength to be honest with yourself than it does to lie. It took a while to build up that strength to even tell [Wilson]. You have to build up trust with someone. Just telling her was like a huge weight off my shoulders.\u201d O\u2019Callaghan said that he had also come out to the Green Bay Packers quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, whom he played alongside at college. He said the Pro Bowler\u2019s reaction had been positive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
