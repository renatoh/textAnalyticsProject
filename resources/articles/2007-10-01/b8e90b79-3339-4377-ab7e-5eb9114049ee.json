And this month, the season is set to give us one of its most dazzling smiles of recent years. Across the country, blazes of red, gold and yellow are beginning to transform trees thanks to the current still, warm, misty days and the cold - but not freezing - nights. These are providing ideal conditions for bringing autumnal colours to our gardens. Ashes and sycamores are beginning to turn yellow, maples are being adorned in glowing auburn. 2007 could be one of the most spectacular autumns of recent times. 'Our trees - particularly our Japanese maples - are just coming to their glorious best,' said John Weir, director of the National Arboretum at Westonbirt, Gloucestershire. 'It is like a firework display. Over the next couple of weeks we expect thousands of visitors to arrive every day to see our trees at their autumnal best. 'Conditions have been ideal. A wet summer and then a dry autumn - that is perfect in this country for bringing colour to trees and also means we have no mud and no puddles. This is going to be a first-rate autumn.' A similar picture was reported by Tony Kirkham at London's Kew Gardens: 'We are having wet, misty mornings, warm afternoons and no strong winds so the leaves have not been blown from the trees. This is how autumn should be,' he said. Among Kew's current glories are its American ashes, tulip trees, and the oddly named Shagbark hickory (Carya ovata) which grows near the garden's pagoda and has turned a vivid yellow. Autumnal colouring is largely caused by the weather, which affects leaf growth. Leaves are the food factories of trees. They contain the green pigment chlorophyll which uses sunlight to convert nutrients, sucked in by roots from the soil, into proteins and starches - the process of photosynthesis. But as the days grow short and night temperatures fall, this change sends a signal to the tree that autumn and winter are approaching. Most trees do not grow in winter and so have no need for food, so photosynthesis is halted. The remaining chlorophyll left on the leaf decomposes and disappears, leaving other pigments to show though. 'Autumn colours can last for a long time but they can also disappear quite quickly, sometimes in a few days,' added Kirkham. 'If the weather is too dry, then leaves die and drop off and we get poor displays. Similarly, strong winds, which we often experience at this time of year, can strip trees of their leaves. Or if there are severe frosts at night, these also kill off leaves and again we can get poor displays. However, there are no signs of any of these conditions affecting the weather at present. 'The weather is wet and misty, it is also still and windless, and while it is cold at night, it has always stayed a few degrees above freezing.' Even better, these conditions are likely to continue for some time, according to Barry Gromett, of the Met Office. 'The next few days will see the same sort of weather pattern affecting Britain, though it should get a little warmer. Certainly, there is nothing in the pipeline to blow away those golds and reds,' he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
