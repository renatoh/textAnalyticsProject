Bloomfield Road may be one of the saddest sights in football nowadays, with two sides demolished and bordered by corrugated iron fences. But the 24-year-old Brett Ormerod yesterday ensured Blackpool's final appearance there this season was such a joyous occasion that it ended with a pitch invasion. Ormerod scored both goals, which represented a poor return for Blackpool's overwhelming control against a Hartlepool side, who started as the Division Three play-off favourites. Ormerod had already played a big part in Blackpool's appearance in the play-offs, scoring in his last four games as they squeezed in with a run of victories at the end of the season. But yesterday was special for the striker who took his total for the season to 23. \"It's unbelievable - one of my best days in football,\" said Ormerod, who joined non-league Accrington after being released by Blackburn Rovers. He was one of the players feared by Hartlepool's manager Chris Turner, who refused to make excuses for one of his team's poorest performances. He admitted: \"The score line wasn't a true reflection of the game. Blackpool played exceptionally well and could have scored more.\" However, Ormerod's first goal just after the hour arrived as Hartlepool were finally threatening to break Blackpool's stranglehold on the game. Steve McMahon's men were growing frustrated over their inability to back up their superiority with goals before Ormerod accelerated on to a searching through-ball from Gary Parkinson. There was still work to be done and, with the defender Nicky Barron tugging at his shirt, Ormerod fired the ball under the goalkeeper Anthony Williams. Williams was at fault on that occasion but was left horribly exposed by his defence 17 minutes later when Ormerod combined with Paul Simpson before finishing efficiently. Hartlepool created a solitary opportunity when Tommy Miller failed to add to his 21 goals from midfield as his angled shot drifted wide of the far post after 83 minutes. McMahon was a relieved man at that moment, knowing a one-goal cushion might not be enough to take to Victoria Park for Wednesday's second leg. McMahon led the praise for Ormerod's contribution, but there were also impressive performances from Danny Coid and Daniel Shittu. Turner faces a difficult task lifting his players after this under-par performance. Man of the match: Brett Ormerod (Blackpool). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
