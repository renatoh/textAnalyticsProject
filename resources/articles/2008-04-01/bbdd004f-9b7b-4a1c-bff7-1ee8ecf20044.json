In his wide-ranging pre-tournament press conference here at Augusta National, the world's second-ranked player remarked that it would be \"pretty cool\" to see the grand slam of all four major championships won by the same man in the same calendar year. \"The last tournament or two, there would be some incredible pressure,\" Mickelson continued. \"I know that Jack [Nicklaus] came close a couple of times back in the 1970s winning the first two events. And I think Arnold [Palmer] did the same in 1960. So they both had chances. \"I remember reading that Jack said the pressure at the British Open was so great. I wouldn't mind experiencing some of that myself. It's a tough feat, although it's certainly a possibility. Tiger [Woods] has won four majors in a row, so it's not an impossible feat. It's been done by Bobby Jones, too. I think it's doable. I just don't know what the odds would be.\" At the time, it was assumed that the 37-year-old Californian was touchingly energised by the prospect of his long-time rival, Woods, annexing the so-called \"Impregnable Quadrilateral\", but after recording a bogey-free round of 68 yesterday it appears that Mickelson may actually have been harbouring winning ambitions of his own. Halfway through this 72nd Masters, the three-times major champion is five under par and well placed to add a third green jacket to his burgeoning if rather one-dimensional wardrobe. As you would expect, Mickelson was happy enough with the lack of dropped shots in what was the 18th time he has broken 70 in 60 Masters rounds (for which he is now a cumulative 49 under par), not a bad strike rate. There is nothing any professional golfer enjoys more than the elimination of error, especially one, like Mickelson, whose game is built around attack rather than defence. Perhaps just as positively, however, Mickelson finished on a generally positive note, a beautifully holed 30-foot putt on the penultimate green breaking a mildly frustrating string of eight pars that included at least four decent chances for further birdies. Another decent opportunity, this time from maybe 15ft, also went begging on the last. In \"tourspeak\", Mickelson left maybe three shots \"out there\", a fact that did not seem to be bothering him overmuch. A professional since 1992, the former US Amateur champion is well aware that the first law of major golf is to stay in contention until the real pressure starts to make its presence felt over the weekend. \"I would love to be in the lead,\" the American conceded. \"You always like having shots in hand. But I would have had to kind of press the issue at some spots and I didn't want to do that yet. So I'm pleased that I have a good chance going into the last two rounds. \"Having said that, I could probably have been a bit lower had I made anything, especially on the back nine. I had trouble getting my speed right on the greens, which seemed to be speeding up as the wind rose. It would have been nice to have taken more advantage of my hitting so many solid shots, but I ended up just making a lot of nice pars. This course is very difficult, though - more so than it was in the past - so anything par or better is always a pretty good round.\" In truth, Mickelson had every right to exude satisfaction after such a solid performance, especially with Woods still on the front nine and the weather conditions likely to deteriorate. Further adding to his fine fettle was the knowledge that, in each of his two victories here in 2004 and 2006, he had similarly sat just off the 36-hole lead. Less logically, he was clutching at the tenuous coincidence that a poor shot to the 13th in 2004's final round had stayed out of Rae's Creek, just as a brace of similarly mis-hit approaches have done this week. \"I'm using that as an omen as well,\" he smiled. Aw shucks. Lyle fears he will never be Ryder Cup captain Sandy Lyle has said he will not \"lose sleep\" over reports that Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal has been approached to captain Europe's Ryder Cup team in two years' time. Lyle, below, had hoped to be asked by Thomas Bjorn, the tournament players' committee chairman, but may now never get the chance. The 50-year-old, who shot a 75 yesterday to be three-over, said: \"Well, I've no idea. If it's happened, it's happened. I'm not going to lose sleep over it. If they feel Olly should be captain for health reasons, maybe, that might be in his favour. It would be a nice honour but life goes on.\" He added: \"I have no interest beyond 2010. I wouldn't even accept it in four years' time. Too old.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
