One man was \u201cclose to death\u201d before he was found, said Ben Pynt, a spokesman for the Darwin Asylum Seeker Support and Advocacy Network (Dassan). Pynt told Guardian Australia the details of several incidents, including one in front of a member of staff at the centre. Pynt said he had spoken to a number of the detainees and had been told of other incidents by fellow detainees. At least one woman who self-harmed had learned of a scheduled transfer of detainees last Thursday \u201cand decided she\u2019d rather die than go to Nauru\u201d, said Pynt. He said most had come to Darwin from Nauru and were fearful of returning. A spokesman for the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said: \u201cA small number of self-harm or attempted self-harm incidents occurred at the Wickham Point immigration detention facility\u201d on Monday. \u201cThose involved are receiving proper and appropriate medical and other support,\u201d he said, adding it was inappropriate to comment on individual circumstances about the incidents or detainees. John Elferink, the Northern Territory minister for health, said his government had an agreement with the federal government to provide health services to detainees but did not answer questions on what care for the detainees has since occurred. He directed questions relating to details of the service agreement to the department of immigration. Last week it was reported cuts to medical services at Wickham Point had resulted in a strain on ambulance services in Darwin and Palmerston. There has been a spate of self harm and apparent suicide attempts inside Australia\u2019s immigration detention network over recent months, including a five-year-old girl and a teenage girl involved in separate incidents in Darwin. A 25-year-old Iranian man in hospital in Perth is believed to be close to death after 38 days on hunger strike. The man has been in detention at Yongah Hills. He has signed an advanced care directive stating he does not want to be resuscitated. In October the NT branch of the Australian Medical Association made formal notifications on seven cases under mandatory reporting laws that the federal government was harming children. Since December 2014 more than 15 Iranian men at the Wickham Point facility have embarked on hunger strikes. It has been alleged the men were told by a manager at the centre: \u201cWe don\u2019t care if you die.\u201d One man, known as Martin, began his strike in November, stopping shortly before Christmas under urging from advocates, before restarting again until February when a court appeal of his case was heard. He remains in extremely poor health as a result, and is classified \u201chigh risk\u201d in the centre. Guardian Australia has also been told by several sources that all single men held in one compound at Wickham Point were moved to another on Wednesday. It is thought the move is to make way for incoming detainees from Western Australia\u2019s Yongah Hills facility, where transfers of more than 80 people to Darwin began last week after a rooftop protest. According to Dassan, there is \u201can extremely high level of fear\u201d among detainees at Wickham Point who are facing transfer to Manus Island or Nauru. \u201cTransfers often happen at 3am and asylum seekers are given no warning, just a message that they must go to the property office,\u201d the organisation said last week. \u201cThey are then detained and staff collect their belongings. They are not even given access to a phone to call their lawyer.\u201d The group called for a halt to transfers of vulnerable asylum seekers, including children, following the release of the Moss review in March. There are several pregnant women in detention in Darwin who are expected to be transferred back to Nauru six to 12 weeks after the birth. The report by the former integrity commissioner Philip Moss was the result of an independent investigation into conditions at the Australian-run detention centre on Nauru. It detailed numerous allegations of rape and assault, consistent reports of self harm among children, and security reports of detainees trading sexual favours for marijuana or displaying naked bodies in exchange for showers. Pynt told Guardian Australia that since the report\u2019s release asylum seekers have been \u201ccoming out of the woodwork\u201d with further horrific stories. \u201cAfter the Moss report people feel like we\u2019re going to believe them, like the department is going to believe them,\u201d said Pynt.
