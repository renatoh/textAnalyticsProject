The former Australian prime minister, who has been playing an increasingly assertive role in security debates, said Isis thrived on conflict and represented the biggest current threat to the world\u2019s peace and stability. Delivering the Fullerton Lecture in Singapore on Wednesday evening, Abbott emphasised the importance of a military victory in Iraq and Syria and called on western countries to consider committing troops to fight alongside local forces. \u201cA military victory over the caliphate isn\u2019t a sufficient response to the challenge of militant Islam but it is a necessary one. The alternative is more attacks on decent people going about their daily lives until the resolve is there to escalate the military campaign against it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge: creating Iraqi and Syrian forces that can destroy the caliphate while respecting non-combatants; and, in the longer term, fostering governments in the Middle East that don\u2019t commit genocide against their own people or permit terrorism against ours. \u201cIt may involve the commitment of western troops to fight alongside local forces. It may involve the creation of safe havens protected by no-fly zones. It may ultimately involve a subdivided Syria, as [former UK foreign secretary] William Hague has suggested. \u201cWhat it can\u2019t involve is the persistence of a blood-soaked caliphate killing in the name of God. \u201cIt will be a long, difficult and costly engagement, quite possibly the task of decades, not years; but before we shrink from such a prospect we should remember how much the world has gained from the US and its allies\u2019 sustained postwar willingness to stand up for universal values as well as for their own interests.\u201d Abbott conceded previous military interventions in Iraq and Libya \u201cended badly\u201d but added: \u201cNot intervening in Syria has so far had the most disastrous results of all: a quarter of a million dead, seven million internally displaced, and four million in camps beyond the borders thinking of coming to Europe, while Islamic State posts, online, for the world to see, ever more barbaric ways to kill people.\u201d He said the efforts would need to involve Sunni forces and any longer-term settlement in Syria and Iraq would need to accommodate all the significant minorities. Abbott said the US announcement of 200 special operations troops to fight in Iraq and Syria was a sign the country was \u201cfinally edging towards the action needed to win this war\u201d. He also praised the British parliament\u2019s vote to support airstrikes against Isis in Syria. Hours after Malcolm Turnbull warned against tagging all Muslims with responsibility for the crimes of a few, his predecessor continued to make forthright comments about the appeal of Isis\u2019s message to \u201cmany Muslims\u201d. In the speech, Abbott described Isis as a \u201cwould-be terrorist empire, proclaiming \u2018death to the infidel\u2019\u201d and said the declaration of a caliphate showed that \u201cIslamic State wants to emulate Mohammed whose early campaigns would have looked just as puny to the great powers of his day\u201d. \u201cIslamic State has a simple but deadly message, submit or die; to most, a mediaeval fantasy, but rational enough to many Muslims based on their scriptures,\u201d Abbott said. Earlier this week, Abbott sparked controversy by calling for a reformation within Islam and arguing that not all cultures were equal. Turnbull, who has recast the national security debate by emphasising mutual respect, responded to the earlier interventions with a plea for people to take care with their rhetoric. The prime minister said terrorists wanted to turn people against the Muslim community \u201cso we should not do anything that plays into their hands\u201d. \u201cIt is absolutely vital to ensure that we don\u2019t make the mistake, which is what the terrorists want us to do, of tagging every single Muslim with the responsibility for the crimes of a few,\u201d Turnbull said on Wednesday. \u201cCan I tell you, everything I say, on this subject, is carefully calculated in the light of the advice I receive from the Australian federal police and from Asio \u2026 Our best allies in the battle against terrorism are the Muslim community and it is absolutely critical that we maintain solidarity and unity within Australia.\u201d The Australian National Imams Council issued a statement saying it welcomed the change in the narrative about Islam under Turnbull\u2019s leadership. \u201cThis is a positive departure from the deliberate conflation of violent extremism with the religion of Islam which serves not only to vilify Australians of Muslim faith but also plays into the hands of extremist recruiters on all sides who propagate the notion that the west is at war with Islam,\u201d the council said on Thursday. The grand mufti of Australia, Ibrahim Abu Mohammad, said Islam did not need a reformation \u201csince the normative principles and practices of the religion allow Muslims to harmoniously coexist within pluralist societies that are based on the universal values of compassion and justice\u201d. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, defended Abbott, saying the former prime minister was motivated by a desire to keep the country safe and was not talking about all Muslims. Abbott had a continuing interest in national security and was a Rhodes scholar, Dutton added. \u201cI think we compound the problems if we don\u2019t talk about them,\u201d Dutton told 2GB on Thursday. \u201cI think we need to recognise that we do ourselves a disservice if we want to sweep this under the carpet.\u201d Alex Hawke, the assistant minister to the treasurer, called for calm in efforts to prevent terrorism. \u201cObviously it\u2019s most helpful if everyone in government and in parliament works together on that process, there isn\u2019t any ego involved in this process, there isn\u2019t any need for people to one up each other,\u201d Hawke told the ABC. Abbott\u2019s speech in Singapore followed his interview with Sky News on Tuesday and his column in the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday. Abbott has hinted he is likely to remain in parliament, saying he has had \u201cthousands and thousands of messages of support and encouragement\u201d since he was ousted as prime minister in September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
