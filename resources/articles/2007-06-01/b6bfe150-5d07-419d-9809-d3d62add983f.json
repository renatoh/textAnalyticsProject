Wayne Hennessey made his Wales debut as a substitute in the 2-2 friendly draw against New Zealand last week and is poised to start in place of Danny Coyne, who has been struggling with a knee injury. The 20-year-old Hennessey played in both semi-final play-off matches for Wolverhampton Wanderers and his greater match sharpness means that Toshack is expected to give him the chance to establish himself above Coyne, who has not played any club football since March. Gareth Bale has been ruled out with an ankle injury but Jason Koumas and Lewin Nyatanga return to the team after missing the match against New Zealand. Nyatanga, whose Derby County team won promotion to the Premiership on Monday, is likely to play on the left of a three-man central defence alongside James Collins and Danny Gabbidon, the West Ham United pair. Gabbidon was rusty in his first competitive match in four months last week but Toshack will persist with a player he regards as vital to his long-term plans. Bale's absence means that Joe Ledley is likely to play in the left-wing-back position, with Koumas expected to return to the midfield alongside Carl Robinson and Simon Davies. That will give Ryan Giggs the freedom to play as a support striker behind Craig Bellamy in his 64th and final match for Wales. Giggs's international retirement leaves a huge void but Toshack has called on the likes of Davies, Gabbidon, Koumas and Bellamy to \"step out of the shadow\" of the Manchester United winger. Davies said: \"We aim to help Ryan go out on a win so he can have that good feeling of retiring on the right note. It is a shame that he has never been able to play on a world stage for his country. We have not been able to help him get there and it was the only thing really missing for him in a great career. I can respect and understand why he has decided to call it a day for Wales. The manager has told us that there are half a dozen of us who have been around this squad for a while now and it is time for us to step up and take the responsibility. Maybe it has been easy to step back.\" The Arsenal midfielder Tomas Rosicky is expected to start for the Czech Republic despite having wisdom teeth removed last week.
