Ancho chillies are often used for their sweet, earthy flavour, along with other chilli varieties, depending on the region and the cook. We made a mutton barbacoa at The Good Life Experience (a festival of music, food and books in Wales) this autumn, spreading the marinade over cauliflower for the non meat-eaters. I loved the result: a vegetarian supper full of deeply complex flavours and wonderful sweetness. Barbacoa roast cauliflower with coriander rice and almonds This makes an excellent plant-based meal if you leave out the sour cream; and a delicious vegetarian one if you don\u2019t. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 250g short-grain brown rice 120ml olive oil 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped 1 tsp salt Small bunch coriander, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped 3 ancho chillies 60ml cider vinegar 1 \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon 1 \u00bd tsp cumin seeds 1 \u00bd tsp dried oregano 1 \u00bd tbsp brown sugar 2 tbsp tomato puree 2 large heads cauliflower, broken into large florets, along with any tender leaves To serve 1 handful toasted, skin-on almonds, chopped 1 lime, quartered Soured cream or Greek yoghurt (optional) Heat the oven to 220C (200C)/gas 7. Rinse the rice well in several changes of cold water. Put two tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan over a medium-high heat, and add a third of the chopped garlic, half the salt, the coriander stalks and the rice. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the grains start to darken, then add 600ml water. Bring to simmering point and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting, cover and leave the rice to finish cooking. Meanwhile, remove the stem and seeds from the chillies and open them up like a book. Warm a dry frying pan over a medium-high heat and, when hot, toast the chillies on both sides for about 30-40 seconds, until they are smelling fragrant and the skin softens \u2013 be careful not to burn them or they will taste bitter. Pop them into a small bowl and cover with boiling water for 10 minutes, until soft. Put the chillies in a blender with 50ml of the soaking water, and blend until finely chopped. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the cauliflower, and puree until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl, tip in the cauliflower florets, any young, tender leaves and the rest of the salt, and use your hands to coat the cauliflower in the marinade. Spread out on to one large oven tray lined with baking paper, and roast for 30-35 minutes, until dark and charred around the edges. Use a fork to fluff up the rice and serve with the cauliflower, a scattering of almonds and coriander leaves, lime wedges and some soured cream, if you like. And for the rest of the week The barbacoa marinade is delicious slathered over everything from pumpkin wedges and celeriac to chicken thighs and lamb shoulder \u2013 experiment. Mix leftover cider vinegar with farmhouse apple juice and sparkling water for a gut-friendly, non-alcoholic cocktail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
