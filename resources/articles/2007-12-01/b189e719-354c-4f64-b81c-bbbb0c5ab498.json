From Monday it is offering an exclusive \"Open Market HomeBuy\" loan where you only have to take out a regular mortgage for 67.5% of the property's value. The new product replaces the Yorkshire's existing offering, which involves taking out a regular mortgage for 75% of the property's value, with the society providing a top-up loan of 12.5% and the government stumping up the remaining 12.5% in the form of a further top-up loan. The new HomeBuy loan is made up of a 67.5% conventional mortgage from the society, a 15% top-up loan provided by the Yorkshire (interest-free for five years, then 3%), and a 17.5% government top-up loan (interest-free for the duration of the mortgage). Buyers have a choice of two deals: 6.79% fixed for five years, or Bank of England base rate plus 1.49% for five years (currently 7.24%). Neither version charges a product fee. Andy Caton, corporate development director at the Yorkshire, says: \"The 32.5% total equity loan is an increase on the previous scheme, thereby increasing customers' buying power and reducing their costs. We have been delighted with the progress of Open Market HomeBuy so far, and are firmly committed to offering potential buyers the best deal possible. \"Despite the increase in funding rates, we have been able to offer a product at a lower rate than the previous product and with no application fee. The five-year products provide stable monthly payments in those crucial early years of home ownership.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
