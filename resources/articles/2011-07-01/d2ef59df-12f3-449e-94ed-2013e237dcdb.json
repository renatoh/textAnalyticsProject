Witnesses reported seeing a man spraying the paintings with a canister as security guards rushed over before detaining him in the room and contacting police. Five officers later came to arrest the man, who is thought to be French. Steven Dear, who was visiting the gallery with friends, said: \"I heard a lot of gasping and turned around and saw him finishing spraying the larger painting. My reaction was to stop him doing any physical damage. I thought he might try to pull it off the wall. \"He was just stood there on his own. He seemed proud of what he had done, giving a verbal protest \u2013 some kind of explanation in French as to why he had done it \u2013 and then just standing there waiting to be arrested. At no point did he try to escape. \"The security guards then came over and snatched the paint cans from him, before clearing the room. It wasn't obvious why he did it, perhaps it was some kind of protest. Maybe a protest at the nakedness of the painting. He covered it all.\" The oil-on-canvas painting depicts the worshipping of a calf by the Israelites during the absence of Moses as he climbed Mount Sinai to receive the tablets of the Ten Commandments. A police spokesman said: \"At 17.15pm police were called to the National Gallery after reports of damage caused to two paintings in the public area. Officers attended and arrested a man at the scene for criminal damage. He is currently in custody at a central London police station.\" It is not the first case of a painting being attacked recently by a visitor to a major national gallery. Paul Gauguin, another French artist, had a painting exhibited in the National Gallery of Art in Washington attacked earlier this year when a woman tried to rip it from the gallery wall. In 2006, a 69-year-old man was arrested after hurling a caustic substance at a 17th-century Dutch masterpiece by the painter Bartholomeus van der Helst. The man was a \"known vandal\" in the art world whose picture had been circulated to security guards at galleries to prevent his entry but still managed to slip in unnoticed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
