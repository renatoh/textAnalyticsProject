There has been a growing feeling that Wigan have been gradually moving through the gears as the play-offs approach: a trait they have certainly shown on plenty of occasions in the past. But this performance, which ultimately secured a first League Leaders\u2019 Shield since 2012, and only a third since 2000, was in many ways a microcosm of their season. Make no mistake about it, Wigan were certainly tested against a Huddersfield side whose own season may not be over, despite the regular season coming to a hastily-arranged conclusion here. Level at the break when Sam Wood\u2019s try cancelled out Sam Powell\u2019s opener, the prospect of Wigan slipping up here and finishing third, meaning no luxury of next week off as the play-offs begin, was a real possibility. But the second half was a familiar story for those who have followed Wigan recently. They steadily improved, and in the end, the pressure they applied on their opponents was always going to be too much, with tries from Jackson Hastings and Zak Hardaker in the final quarter ensuring it would be Wigan, not St Helens, who go into the play-offs sitting top. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased,\u201d Wigan\u2019s coach, Adrian Lam, said. \u201cWe were top going into lockdown and it\u2019s been a difficult season, but for everyone at the club it\u2019s a big moment.\u201d Though they weren\u2019t quite at their best, credit must go to their opponents. Powell\u2019s early try looked to have set Wigan on their way, but after commendably fighting back, Wood\u2019s leveller after pouncing on a rare error from Bevan French was the least they deserved at the break. Huddersfield, after finishing seventh, are now on standby to be called into the play-offs should any team suffer Covid-related complications, and if they do get the call, this performance showed they will be no pushovers. \u201cWe need to prepare like we\u2019re going to be in,\u201d their coach, Luke Robinson, said, \u201cbecause with everything that\u2019s gone on this year, there\u2019s every chance we could get pulled in at the last minute.\u201d But in the end, the quality and calibre Wigan\u2019s backline possessed was the difference. There were near-misses for the Warriors in the minutes leading up to Hastings\u2019s instinctive finish from dummy-half on the hour mark, and two minutes later his well-weighted kick was superbly collected by Hardaker, who converted to make it 18-6. Hastings was on hand to add further comfort to the scoreline in the closing minutes with a drop goal, but by then, the result was secure. Wigan will watch the opening week of the play-offs \u2013 which sees Warrington play Hull and Catalans v Leeds in eliminator matches \u2013 knowing that when they join the following week, they do so with real confidence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
