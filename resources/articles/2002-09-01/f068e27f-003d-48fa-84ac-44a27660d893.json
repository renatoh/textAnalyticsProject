After beating Newcastle and Manchester United last week Leeds look to have little to fear from the Ukrainian unknowns, standing 15th of 18 in their own premier league and making their debut in Europe. But Venables has done his Ukrainian homework, noting that Zaporizhia finished fifth last season. \"They are no fools. People might say 'Well, there's only Dynamo Kiev in their league and one or two others', but that's not quite true.\" The Leeds manager also cited the damage done on Tuesday by another little known eastern European team, Viktoria Zizkov. \"Look at what happened to Rangers. They came unstuck. These teams are very difficult and there are more and more like that.\" Venables has confirmed that Michael Bridges will be on the bench, ending a two-year injury absence with knee and achilles problems. After a successful pre-season and three reserve matches the 24-year-old striker is finally ready to make his comeback. But the captain Dominic Matteo (knee) and midfielder Nick Barmby (back) are doubtful. Fulham make their European debut but will encounter some faces familiar to English followers as they confront Hajduk Split in Croatia. The former Derby and West Ham defender Igor Stimac is expected to feature in a side whose head coach is the former Hammer and Evertonian Slaven Bilic. Hajduk's manager Zoran Vulic praised the newcomers: \"[Jean] Tigana has excellent technical players, so Fulham are very strong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
