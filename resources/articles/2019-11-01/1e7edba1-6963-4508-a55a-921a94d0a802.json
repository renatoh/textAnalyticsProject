Here is Ewan Murray\u2019s report. O\u2019Neill: \u201cThings that we can be pleased about and frustrating things. The penalty was a good chance and we didn\u2019t take it. \u201cIn the second half we couldn\u2019t get to the ball enough. \u201cWe didn\u2019t particularly lose anything, we weren\u2019t under so much pressure. We should have been braver. \u201cSteven\u2019s a fantastic player and he knows himself it\u2019s not the best penalty he\u2019s hit.\u201d Van Dijk: \u201cVery tough. We know that. Everyone knew beforehand, they were waiting for moments to press. The penalty was a decision the referee made and Stevo missed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t let them create too many chances. We\u2019re very happy that we\u2019ve qualified. On missed penalty: \u201cThe pitch doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s a big stage and it can happen to anyone.\u201d Here is a bad penalty ... Have you all gone to watch Prince Andrew\u2019s PR disaster? Cathcart: \u201cA little bit disappointed to come away with the draw. \u201cWe just need to pick ourselves up and move on to the Germany match.\u201d Dallas: \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed we didn\u2019t win the game. We went toe to toe with one of the best in the world.\u201d On missed penalty: \u201cThese things happen in football, it can happen to anyone.\u201d On playing in four positions: \u201cThe manager just tells me what to do and I go an do it.\u201d No shots on target for Northern Ireland. Not a great record, especially as they had a penalty. I think it\u2019s optimistic for the lads in the studio to say they deserved more. Northern Ireland completed 309 passes to the Dutch\u2019s 713. Not very close. Back in the big time! The Dutch are celebrating in front of their fans. They controlled the game for almost the entirety of the match and probably could have upped if required. Netherlands qualify for the Euros with that draw, while Northern Ireland are set for the playoffs. In any other circumstances this would be seen as a good point for the hosts. Davis missed the vital penalty, which is a shame but it was ultimately a battle to hold on as they failed to create anything against a very good Dutch side. 90+2 mins: All a bit scrappy as he head to the full-time whistle. 90 mins: Babel is replaced by Ake has the Dutch accept the draw. Three minutes for Northern Ireland to find a winner. 89 mins: McNair swings in a corner from the right but Babel is the man to head clear. McGinn then dinks it in from the other side but that is also dismissed by the defence. \u201cWe love you Michael, we do\u201d rings round the stadium, which is sweet. Scott says: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he did more than four in a game, but Phillip Cocu often played multiple positions in a game.\u201d 87 mins: Smith gets the ball into the box and chips a cross towards goal but Cillessen comes to claim, probably as he\u2019s just very cold. 85 mins: Dallas goes into the book for pulling someone or other back. He just wants to be part of the action all the time. 83 mins: Can anyone remember someone playing in more than four positions in one night? 81 mins: I think Dallas might have just shot from 80 yards out and it\u2019s gone out for a throw, 20 yards from the Dutch net. Fair play. Instead, Thompson is on for Lewis, resulting in Dallas moving to left-back. His fourth position of the night. I think O\u2019Neill might need to sign him for Stoke. 79 mins: Northern Ireland clear a cross to Frenkie De Jong 25 yards from goal and he can only lift a shot well over the bar. Is it time for Lafferty? It\u2019s the best option, no? 77 mins: McGinn nips in to to knock the ball into the box, he chases it but Veltman gets across him and goes down when touched by the Northern Irishman. 75 mins: The Dutch are having all the ball but are not planning on doing much with it. Northern Ireland need a goal but do not seem to have the energy to get the ball back. 73 mins: The Northern Ireland fans are stilling giving their all. Not to mention, the orange corner of Dutch supporters which has added to the atmosphere. The pace has somewhat gone out of the game, though. 71 mins: McGinn replaces Corry Evans, which can be seen to be an attacking change. Dallas moves into the middle and McGinn will play on the left as O\u2019Neill looks for a win. Dallas onto his third position of the night. 69 mins: Northern Ireland need to bring someone on into the centre of the park to provide some energy as they are rapidly running out of it. 67 mins: Promes whips a cross into the the box and Luuk De Jong goes down under pressure from Smith. The whistle is blown for offside, rather than a penalty and Northern Ireland breathe a sigh of relief. Moments later Blind gets behind Whyte on the left, drills a cross towards Promes but Cathcart intercepts and sends it out for a corner. The Dutch are very much on top here. 65 mins: The Dutch are just keeping possession and almost toying with the hosts. Eventually, Cathcart tries to solve the problem by taking down Babel on the right flank. Luuk De Jong replaces Berghuis. 63 mins: Bloomin\u2019 heck! The Dutch are going to bring on Luuk De Jong, meaning we could have two De Jongs and two Evanses on the pitch, which just makes my job needlessly harder on a Saturday night. 61 mins: Northern Ireland look very tired and are playing extremely deep, forcing O\u2019Neill on the sidelines to keep shouting at his players to push up. This could be a long final half an hour. 59 mins: Smith has gone to right-back and Dallas has moved to left wing. 57 mins: A high ball is lumped into the box by De Jong, Veltman rises highest to knock it back across the area for Babel to attack but his header is well saved by Peacock-Farrell. Saville goes off and Smith comes on. 55 mins: Cathcart slips when looking to send a long ball and subsequently completely miskicks it. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s lost his footing. Maybe he needs some better studs. Netherlands are amusing themselves by knocking the ball around. 53 mins: Davis passes the ball out for a throw-in. Northern Ireland are very much on the back foot here. They need to stem the flow here somehow. 51 mins: Van de Beek gets the wrong side of the defence and sends a low cross into the six-yard box but Jonny Evans is waiting and whacks it clear. 49 mins: Babel breaks through the middles, lays it off to Promes who is dispossessed in the box by Davis who is trying to make up for his earlier missed penalty. 47 mins: Lewis lumps a well-shaped cross into the box from the left, Magennis moves into space but gets under the ball and heads it well over the bar. Here we go again! Additionally, Germany are winning, so it does not really matter what Northern Ireland do here. Hey advertisers, I have already bought my one Christmas present for the year. Please stop showing me your adverts. Also ... my neighbour already has a holly wreath on the door. Surely, that is too early! JR emails in to say: \u201cThat handball call is the type of call Ireland are going to need on Monday if they want any chance of beating Denmark. Any chance we can get this ref (Marciniak) to just drive down to Dublin after this game? It\u2019s so close he\u2019d have plenty of time for a nice stop off at Newgrange tomorrow. It\u2019s right on the way. \u201cOr maybe Ireland will get to take their chances with that fella who did the Scotland game earlier.\u201d Davis must have watched this ... Northern Ireland will be left to rue the penalty miss. It was hilariously bad and I am sure Davis probably broke a light in the stand behind. The Dutch have looked good going forward without testing Peacock-Farrell. 45 mins: A free-kick is lifted into the box, Van Dijk gets beyond the defence and knocks the ball down for an oncoming teammate but no one arrives and the ball ends up behind for a goal kick. One minute added on. 44 mins: Both teams might be happy to get through to half-time here. The game has slowed down after quite an intense opening half in general. 42 mins: Davis slips the ball down the line for Whyte, who plays in a harmless cross, or so it seems, until Propper slips instead of clearing. Sadly, for the hosts, the Dutch recover the ball and remove the danger. 40 mins: Davis\u2019 evening gets worse as he is booked for a challenge on De Jong. The Northern Ireland captain stuck a boot in on the Dutchman when he dribbled past him. Hilariously cynical. 38 mins: Bailey Peacock-Farrell having three surnames forming his name is very confusing. I keep thinking his surname is Bailey-Peacock. He has done a fine job so far, considering he does not get a look in at Burnley. 36 mins: An early sub for the visitors, with Propper set to come for De Roon, who was booked earlier on. Koeman must be worried about what Northern Ireland are offering in the middle of the park. Babel lays the ball off to Blind 20 yards out and the full-back lifts a shot over the bar. 34 mins: Well, that was a truly dreadful penalty. Northern Ireland were lucky to get the penalty in the first place, so maybe justice was done. Davis went with power and found absolutely no accuracy. 32 mins: Cillessen plays mind games by moaning about where the ball is placed on the spot. Davis steps up after quite a delay and whacks it over the bar! A long way over! 30 mins: Northern Ireland have a penalty! Or do they? He\u2019s booked someone and is talking the entire Dutch defence without pointing to the spot. McNair swung in a cross which Saville turns towards goal only to see it hit Veltman\u2019s arm. It\u2019s a harsh one as he was only inches away. 28 mins: McNair tries to get the better of Van Dijk, realises it\u2019s a forlorn hope and turns back, with the ball ending up with his own goalkeeper 20 seconds later. 26 mins: Promes gets the better of Dallas down the wing and lifts in a dangerous cross which goes over the head of a flapping Peacock-Farrell, but also everyone else, and out of the box. 24 mins: Northern Ireland have slowed things down, purely because they could not keep up such a ludicrous pace as they set early doors. Now it is case of managing their energy for the next 65 minutes. 22 mins: Northern Ireland have completed 25 passes to Netherlands\u2019 150. Good luck to the hosts! Van de Beek plays a pass through to Babel to take onwards but the flag goes up as the forward whacks at shot which is palmed behind. It was certainly tight. 2o mins: Part-time full-back Dallas is in for a long night at right-back I feel. He is firstly up against Promes who is looking very dangerous, then Babel is pulling onto him whenver he can and Blind is getting up the left flank at every chance. I will keep count of every time the commentators refer to Daley Blind as Danny Blind. Obviously, I will make the same mistake myself. 18 mins: Veltman chucks himself to the ground after Lewis touches his shoulder. A hilarious overreaction from the Ajax man to win a free-kick. 16 mins: Blind controls a perfect crossfield pass and lays the ball off to Babel who fluffs his lines from the middle of the goal and it goes straight to the goalkeeper\u2019s arms. Promes then whacks a shot from the left-hand side of the area but it goes inches wide. 14 mins: Netherlands are under a little less pressure now when they pass it around the back. Admittedly, it would have been impossible for Northern Ireland to keep up the early tempo. 12 mins: De Roon is booked for tripping McNair, meaning he will miss the next match. The Dutch seem to have settled now, though. 10 mins: Netherlands are trying to get a foot in the game. Promes gets into the box and pulls the ball back but Lewis clears. The winger then gets to the byline seconds late and does the same, Berghuis gets to the ball first but he mishits his shot from five yards and it loops onto the crossbar before an almighty scrap to clear the ball. A let-off for Northern Ireland. 8 mins: Whyte swings in a free-kick from the right which Cillessen comes to punch but only gets it as far as Saville on the edge of the box, he smacks a low drive with the goalkeeper AWOL but the ball hits De Ligt on the ground and is cleared. Northern Ireland are really at it currently. So much energy on the pitch and in the stands. 6 mins: Relentless stuff from Northern Ireland as they put pressure on all over the pitch. McNair swings in a cross from the right, Magennis gets across his marker and flicks a header towards the far post but it flashes just wide. 4 mins: Incredible scenes as Corry Evans chases down a backpass to Cillessen, with the goalkeeper whacking it against the midfielder who blocks it and the ball almost ends up in the back of the net, he then tries to set up Magennis but his pass goes astray. This is an intense start from the hosts. I can confirm it is extremely lively in Windsor Park. The fans are playing their part, that is for sure. 2 mins: Netherlands whack it long for Babel to get things going, which is not what I was expecting. Cillessen hits a woeful clearance that only travels 30 yards to the feet of Whyte, who dribbles down the right flank only to see his cross hit the first man. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! The players are on the pitch and I am reminded that the Dutch kit is one of the best around. Van Dijk and De Ligt is a decent centre-back pairing. Josh Magennis was impressive in the reverse fixture but it will be one of the toughest tests of his career tonight. A good win for Wales today. I would like some of this, please. O\u2019Neill: \u201cWe have to go and try to win the game. We\u2019ve picked a team with that in mind. \u201cI think we\u2019ve put as much pace in the team as we can with Stuart Dallas and Jamal Lewis coming in.\u201d Michael O\u2019Neill will have a new Championship rival after Neil Harris was appointed Cardiff boss today. That\u2019s a relief! Scott Minto is actually in Belfast for the match and David Prutton has been relieved. Just 114 caps. Not bad going. Is David Prutton going to carry on for a third game? I will be worried for him if he does. Two is just about doable but presenting three separate matches in a day is madness. I also did the MBM on this earlier and the referee was farcically bad. I am hoping the one in Belfast is better. No Memphis Depay for Netherlands tonight but we do get Ryan Babel, so I am pretty happy. Depay has been in great nick for Lyon this season, making it a shame that we do not get to see him as he looks to vanquish the reputation built during his time at Old Trafford. Your main man Nick Ames is in Pristina, so has written this: Michael O\u2019Neill is off to Stoke but he is focused on the task in hand with Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland: Peacock-Farrell, J Evans, Cathcart, C Evans, Lewis, Saville, Davis, McNair, Whyte, Magennis, Dallas Netherlands: Cillesen, Veltman, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Blind, De Roon, De Jong, Berghuis, Van de Beek, Babel, Promes Good evening! Northern Ireland\u2019s manager has announced he is off and their qualification hopes hang by a thread, so it\u2019s not a great time for the team. On the upside, Netherlands are in town, meaning we should be in for a bit of entertainment as the Dutch seem to have found their feet again under Ronald Koeman. The visitors need just a point to confirm their place at the Euros and they will be planning to secure it tonight. This is not the end of O\u2019Neill and Northern Ireland as they will go into the playoffs next year and the manager will stay on for those matches while also being in charge at Stoke. Northern Ireland ran Netherlands close last month, leading into the closing stages until the Dutch turned the game around late on with two quick goals. Let\u2019s hope they can make it a cracking game once again! Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
