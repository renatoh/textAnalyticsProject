Greece said it was willing to discuss a compromise under which it would get the 2,300-year-old artefacts - or if necessary only some of them - on temporary loan. In return, Britain would borrow masterpieces of classical antiquity never seen here before. The Greek loan would include statues and vases - from the same period as the marbles - discovered recently during excavations for the Athens metro. An official at the British Museum, which has owned the marbles for nearly 200 years, reportedly said it was conducting talks with the Greek authorities about \"a temporary loan for the period of the [Olympic] games\" to be held in Athens in 2004. The proposal, effectively for a short-term swap, was said to be \"the most serious proposal made so far\". Greece is working on a brisk timetable to try to get the marbles back for display in its new Parthenon museum before the games open. Yesterday the Greek culture minister, Evanelos Venizelos, said from his home in Thessaloniki: \"We are not interested in the legal form of an agreement. The form of ownership is not important to us. In principle, we would not exclude anything from the discussion.\" His spokesman, Nicos Papadakis, said: \"I do not know the specific form of any talks which could be taking place with the British Museum. \"Of course we would be prepared to discuss a short-term loan if it was the beginning of a process of the return of the marbles. And if it was a question of just a few of them coming back, of course we would discuss it. \"Of course, also, we would ensure that the Duveen gallery [which houses the marbles in the museum] did not stand empty. \"The antiquities from the metro excavation are wonderful pieces of art which have not been seen outside Greece.\" Repeated earlier Greek requests for the full, permanent return of the marbles have so far been curtly refused by the government, although official Labour party policy before the 1997 election was to hand them back. In June, after Mr Venizelos appealed to the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, a department spokesman said: \"We believe the right place for the marbles is in the British Museum.\" Last night a culture department spokesman said: \"If the British Museum decided to do that [a short-term loan], it is a matter for them. There are no discussions going on from the government's point of view.\" Useful links Interactive guide: History of the Elgin marbles Hellenic Ministry of Culture The British Museum Education Guardian: Who should have the Elgin marbles?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
