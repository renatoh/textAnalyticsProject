On the eve of a two-day working visit to London, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin also told the Guardian that France regarded the \u20ac39bn financial settlement Britain has agreed to pay the EU as part of the exit deal as a matter of international law. \u201cWe are now waiting for clarification from the UK side,\u201d De Montchalin said. \u201cWe consider it is up to Britain to decide how it wants to proceed. The exit agreement was not negotiated against the British; negotiators on both sides tried, painstakingly, to find the best solution for all concerned.\u201d Several Tory leadership candidates have said that if they are selected, their priority will be to go to Brussels and seek to renegotiate the deal agreed last December \u2013 and that if they do not succeed, Britain must be ready to leave without a deal. Others have said a further extension could be necessary. Boris Johnson, the favourite to succeed Theresa May as party leader and prime minister, has pledged to consider withholding Britain\u2019s Brexit \u201cdivorce\u201d payment until the EU27 agree to improve the terms on which the UK\u2019s leaves, describing the money as \u201ca great lubricant\u201d in getting a good deal. But De Montchalin, who replaces France\u2019s former Europe minister Natalie Loiseau, now an MEP, said the bloc was not willing to reopen the 599-page exit agreement. \u201cIf Britain does want to leave, and if it wants to leave in an orderly fashion, then this is the way it must do it,\u201d she said. She said the only condition on which France would be prepared to grant a further extension to the 31 October deadline would be if there were to be a \u201cprofound change\u201d to Britain\u2019s current political stance on Brexit. \u201cAs President Macron has said, if there is a totally new political line in Britain, the Europeans would be prepared to reconsider,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for now, 31 October is the final deadline.\u201d A no-deal Brexit was \u201cnot what France wants\u201d, de Montchalin added, \u201cbut we are prepared for it, and so it is now a realistic option.\u201d Emmanuel Macron said last week he considered 31 October to be the \u201cfinal, final deadline\u201d for Britain\u2019s much delayed departure, saying he did not want the new European Commission and executive to have to deal with Brexit. De Montchalin described the \u20ac39bn that Johnson has threatened to hold back as \u201cnot a settling of scores, or some kind of exit bill \u2013 this sum simply represents Britain\u2019s engagements. So this is now a matter of respecting international law \u2026 Britain will always be France\u2019s neighbour.\u201d She said the EU 27 would remain united through the next Brexit stage, dismissing suggestions that some leaders might be ready to break ranks. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, claimed this weekend that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would be willing to renegotiate the UK\u2019s Brexit deal and possibly the Irish backstop. \u201cEvery single member state realises the importance of maintaining that unity and engaging with the UK through the the EU,\u201d she said. \u201cThere can be no mini-deals. It\u2019s a question of the credibility of the bloc. And all have understood the importance of the future relationship with Britain.\u201d She said it would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d for France or any other EU member state to interfere in the present impasse. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to say the UK is wasting its time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem is that there are almost as many kinds of Brexit as there are MPs. But we do need clarity now. We need a decision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
