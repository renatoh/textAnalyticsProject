The plea has been prompted by scientists\u2019 rapid progress in developing a powerful tool called genome editing, which has the potential to transform the treatment of genetic conditions by rewriting the DNA code of affected cells. Although UK law bans genetic modification of embryos for clinical uses, it is permitted in research laboratories under licence from the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) \u2013 provided the embryos are destroyed after 14 days. In a position statement published on Wednesday, five leading biomedical funders declare support for genome-editing research and certain therapies that might follow, such as infusions of modified immune cells that are tailor-made to attack patients\u2019 tumours. But they add that altering the DNA of human sperm and eggs, known as \u201cgerm cells\u201d, and human embryos should become the focus of a broad ethical debate that fully explores the potential benefits and pitfalls of the procedure. The prospect of modifying human embryos is deeply controversial because the DNA changes, and any unintended potentially harmful effects, would be passed on from generation to generation. The risks of altering the human germ line, as it is called, has troubled ethicists for decades. Without proper regulation, the procedure also raises the spectre of \u201cdesigner babies\u201d, where embryos are genetically modified to enhance them in the eyes of their parents. \u201cWe believe that genome-editing technologies may hold significant potential for clinical applications in the future, and we would be open to supporting the development of new therapeutic approaches should the evidence from research advance sufficiently to justify their use,\u201d the statement says. It adds: \u201cThere may be future potential to apply genome editing in a clinical context using human germ cells or embryos, though we understand this is unlikely to be permissible in European jurisdictions at present. This raises important ethical and regulatory questions which need to be anticipated and explored.\u201d The statement is signed by the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Association of Medical Research Charities and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. In laboratory studies, scientists have used genome editing \u2013 known technically as Crispr-Cas9 \u2013 to correct mutations that cause metabolic disorders, to create cells that attack tumours and to make others that are resistant to HIV infection. The most controversial study emerged in April when Chinese researchers took faulty IVF embryos that would otherwise have been discarded and edited the DNA to fix an aberrant gene that causes a life-threatening blood disorder. Shortly before the Chinese study was published, a group of US scientists led by Edward Lanphier, chairman of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in Washington DC, called for a global moratorium on modifying human reproductive cells and embryos, even for basic research. \u201cSuch research could be exploited for non-therapeutic modifications. We are concerned that a public outcry about such an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development,\u201d the group wrote in the journal Nature. Michael Werner, executive director of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, said it agreed \u201cto the need for a robust discussion about this important topic\u201d. Similar concerns were voiced in the US journal Science by a group that included one of the inventors of Crispr-Cas9, Jennifer Doudna, from the University of California, Berkeley. Unlike the UK, the US has no law banning the creation of genetically modified embryos for clinical uses. Katherine Littler, senior policy adviser at the Wellcome Trust, said: \u201cWe think it\u2019s important to look at the issues in relation to human cells, and particularly the germ line, in clinical applications. It\u2019s a long way off, but we think it\u2019s very important that these issues are looked at. \u201cLet\u2019s have some well thought-through debates. A moratorium is the wrong starting point. We want an open dialogue. We want people to have an open mind about the issues rather than respond straight away. \u201cAre there specific diseases, are there areas where this would be the most efficient and effective way to do to it, where this would be acceptable? That\u2019s part of the debate that has to be had. \u201cYou can\u2019t predict where the public or even the science community will take this debate, but hopefully it will be informed by good science and good ethics and not hyped fears.\u201d The issues raised by genome editing are due to be explored by the US National Academy of Sciences, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, and the Hinxton Group, an international organisation that brings scientists and policymakers together. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that these bodies do this to frame the issues and work out what the key ethical questions are, rather than it being overtaken by people who already have a particular stance,\u201d Littler added. Peter Mills, from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, said: \u201cThey [the funders of the research] are clearly conscious of the broad public-interest questions that go beyond the scientific risks involved in germline editing, and they are keen to get that debate moving. \u201cThe possibility of germline editing has come into view and they want to move forward with a debate on this before we arrive at that point.\u201d This article was amended on 4 September 2015. An earlier version said \u201cpotentially unintended harmful effects\u201d where \u201cunintended potentially harmful effects\u201d was meant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
