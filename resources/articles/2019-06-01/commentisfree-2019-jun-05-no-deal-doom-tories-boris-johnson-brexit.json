That\u2019s the spirit! We\u2019ve got to have the courage to tell the people of this country we can do it if we really want to.\u201d So says Boris Johnson in his jaunty launch video, all blind faith that he alone can leap the Brexit impasse when he is anointed prime minister (odds now 11/10). Where\u2019s the democratic legitimacy? We the people are mere dumbfounded onlookers at the insolence of this coup, not \u201ctaking back control\u201d but letting him seize it. Already his \u201cno deal\u201d talk is doing real damage. UK manufacturing shrank last month at the fastest rate since the referendum, with export orders at a three-year low. Construction figures fell their fastest for a year due to \u201congoing political and economic uncertainty\u201d as \u201ca fragile dreariness descended on the sector\u201d, according to the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. Retail sales fell by 2.7% in May, the worst drop since records began, though consumer spending is what has kept the economy afloat. Wednesday\u2019s service sector figures are unlikely to lift the gloom. Make UK, representing manufacturers employing 2.7 million people, blames Brexit chaos, pointing at cavalier candidates calling for a no-deal Brexit. Even \u201cmoderate\u201d Jeremy Hunt supports no deal, though \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d. Never mind his heart, look at the real world consequences of these wildly irresponsible would-be leaders. \u201cThere is a link between people standing up and saying no deal is acceptable and people losing their jobs as a direct result,\u201d warns Make UK\u2019s chief executive Stephen Phipson. Reckless Brexiters call it Project Fear, but he says: \u201cIt\u2019s not theoretical or hypothetical scaremongering.\u201d It\u2019s happening now. Talking to manufacturers large and small in the past few days, I have heard them describe in granular detail what no deal means. Gordon Ellis and Co, with a \u00a35m turnover, makes healthcare aids and employs 100 people in Castle Donington, Leicestershire. They export 20% to the EU: if there\u2019s no deal, trading on WTO rules adds a 6% tariff. Even worse, they need an EU CE quality kitemark to sell in Europe, requiring an EU-authorised representative and file holder, which could cost tens of thousands of euros. Companies say that in the absence of a CE mark but with some newly invented UK kitemark instead, the world is less likely to buy British. Managing director Fiona Ellis-Winkfield wrote to her MP warning that no deal will add \u00a390,000 costs and cause job losses. She told him some employees \u201cvoted Brexit, but they will happily tell you they didn\u2019t vote for a \u2018no deal\u2019 and a risk to their jobs\u201d, and that as a Tory voter, \u201cI will not be able to vote Tory in the next election should there be a no deal\u201d. What response? Her plea fell on deaf ears: her MP is Andrew Bridgen, extreme no dealer. Schneider Electric, with a \u00a31bn turnover and 4,500 employees, tells the same story, expecting a 10% hit and the same tariff and kitemark problems. Their greatest risk is the Brexit effect halting big national construction projects. Forget any talk of an \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d to invest in infrastructure for declining areas. The fall of superstar fund manager Neil Woodford is an interesting Brexit result, as his once \u00a315bn fund slams its doors to anyone trying to escape. After the referendum he bragged he would defy gloomy Brexit forecasts. The FT reported \u201che sees Brexit as a buying opportunity, he has been building stakes in UK banks, retailers and housebuilders \u2013 which he believes are discounted for economic Armageddon \u2013 as he refuses to \u2018chase the zeitgeist\u2019\u201d. But Brexit caught up with him. Johnson\u2019s video, neutralising his past \u201cFuck business\u201d remark, pledges to \u201csupport our wealth creators and business sector because otherwise we\u2019re not going to have the dosh to invest and cut some taxes\u201d. Soon he will saunter into No 10 with no plans and a promise to leave the EU on 31 October that is bound to be blocked by the limbo parliament. The EU will not shift on Ireland\u2019s backstop, as the DUP menaces for more bribes. The sound of crashing economic indices will ring in his ears, with no money in the Treasury, no trade agreements except Donald Trump\u2019s sinister \u201conce the UK gets rid of the shackles\u201d offer. Terrified of an election, his party dare not bring him down, but a referendum will look grim. His lifelong bid for glory will be rewarded with a historic role as the last Conservative prime minister. From journalist purveyor of Euro-myth poison through to seizing power without consent, he will be architect of his party\u2019s demise. These reckless last-of-the-Tories deserve their fate. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
