Hesitant at first, and then, as the night ticked on, in a torrent, as surprise turned to shock and then fear. \u201cIs Dutts gone?\u201d \u201cDo you have any update on Dutts?\u201d \u201cDid we lose Dickson?\u201d They didn\u2019t. The Liberal National party held on to the minister\u2019s seat at the last federal election by about 1,500 votes. A couple of blocks, really. But the scare, on a night filled with Liberal electoral horrors, had come as a surprise. The man who would be leader had almost lost his seat in a fight no one, not even Labor, had even seriously considered to be on the cards. The battle for Dickson began about 9pm on 2 July 2016. And it has been raging ever since. Peter Dutton may not be the most popular man in the party room, but you wouldn\u2019t know it north of the border. The LNP, officially one party in Queensland, by and large adores the former police officer, a hang-up from when soon-to-be former senator Barry O\u2019Sullivan attempted to shape the party, and its candidates, in his mould. Dutton, along with Stuart Robert and Steve Ciobo, is one of the party\u2019s best fundraisers, and remains popular with the Young LNP; a figure who is able to marshal support in an increasingly fractured party. But all of that means nothing if the voters don\u2019t feel the same way. And so, Dutton\u2019s own \u201ccaravan of courage\u201d \u2013 the mobile office he has trotted out since 2001\u2013 has been back on the road, trying to win back enough votes to keep the swing against both the government and his personal brand at bay. Dutton\u2019s politics may not have changed, but Dickson has. Those postcodes between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast have attracted more and more young families and professionals, with McMansions and houses with media rooms springing up in the northern suburbs, for the same price as an inner-city two-bedder. Further north you hit Samford, with its \u201cretreats\u201d, country pubs and \u201cgive way to horse riders\u201d signs. Dutton saw the change coming. Before the 2010 election he tried to jump seats to the Gold Coast, where a blue corflute, no matter the face, is enough to win you the electorate. But that was when George Brandis still held sway, and branches will do as branches want \u2013 Dutton found himself locked out. So to Dickson he returned. But relief at change only lasts so long, and Labor, without even really trying, managed to make enough of a dent in Dutton\u2019s margin that suddenly toppling the man-who-could-have-been-prime minister became the little campaign that could. \u201cIt\u2019s ... not great,\u201d an LNP strategist says when asked about the campaign for Dickson. \u201cWe are in trouble. He knows it, we know it, Labor knows it. It\u2019s almost like starting from scratch.\u201d That\u2019s obvious to those following the campaign from the outside. Paul Williams, a senior politics lecturer at Griffith University, predicts Dutton will lose. \u201cOn a 2% margin, improved slightly in the redistribution from 1.6%, Dickson\u2019s margin is still so fragile that it almost certainly won\u2019t withstand the national swing to Labor, even if that swing \u2013 appearing to be about 4% or 5% nationally \u2013 were muted in Queensland,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, given the Scott Morrison coup has done little to reverse the Coalition slide in Queensland, the swing north of the Tweed, even in outer metro and regional seats, is likely to be strong. \u201cWith GetUp also campaigning in Dickson, it\u2019s almost certain Dutton will be defeated. \u201cIf and when Queensland federal LNP representation is decimated, defeated MPs and grassroots members will likely blame the state executive for pursuing an arch-conservative strategy that included advocacy for a Dutton move against Malcolm Turnbull.\u201d GetUp announced it would be targeting Dickson almost immediately after the last election. The Greens have worked to put in a good showing, and Labor sent Ali France, a United Voice left candidate, out into the field as soon as possible. There are still those in Labor who question whether a right faction candidate such as Linda Lavarch, who was defeated by France, might have been a wiser choice. But France, a disability advocate and a local, is clearly campaigning to win. And Labor, still not convinced of victory, but able to see several scenarios where it happens, has thrown its full campaign might behind her bid. \u201cWe are very much ready for an election in Dickson,\u201d France says. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last six months solidly door knocking and talking to voters about the issues that are important to them and the overwhelming feedback is that they want stability and an end to the chaos in Canberra. \u201cWinning this seat, however, is not going to be easy. Peter Dutton is a formidable campaigner, he\u2019s held this seat for 18 years and he\u2019s boasted of a $650,000 war chest in which to fight this election. \u201cOur strength is our people. We have an incredible group of local volunteers that is growing every day and we will deliver the biggest field campaign that this seat has ever seen. Our goal is to have had a conversation with every household in Dickson by election day and we are well on our way to achieving that goal.\u201d Speaking on background, Labor strategists say they see the Dickson campaign as twofold. Not only are they attempting to keep Dutton in the electorate for as much time as possible, blunting his impact during the wider election campaign, they also believe that for every $1 Labor spends, Dutton is spending double. And that keeps campaign funds away from other areas, where other Coalition MPs are in trouble. Dutton has been a regular at roads announcements, as he embarks on a campaign those around him have likened to Queensland Labor\u2019s tactics in 2013 \u2013 the \u201cI\u2019ll fight for you, no matter who is in government\u201d route \u2013 given the Coalition\u2019s unlikely election prospects. He has also been digging in. Dutton, not the party, has hired Geoffrey Greene to help on his campaign. A former Queensland and South Australian party state director, Greene was best known for his work behind the scenes for John Howard\u2019s campaigns. Then he became best known as the former LNP director who was expelled from the party he helped create during a time of mass internal turmoil, launching a million-dollar-plus lawsuit against the organisation, which he later dropped. Greene has been part of Dutton\u2019s campaign for almost a year, in a sign, at least to Dutton\u2019s party colleagues, that he is seriously worried about losing the seat, even if outwardly it\u2019s business as usual. On the ground and in public, Dutton is doing his best to deflect from GetUp\u2019s campaign, painting it as an outsider\u2019s attempt to disrupt local politics. \u201cWell Dickson has always been a very close marginal seat,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2007 we won by 217 votes, but people know that GetUp is a front for the Greens. \u201cThe fact is that the Greens don\u2019t support us on border protection, GetUp don\u2019t support us on border protection, but most people in my electorate would see GetUp as a southern outfit run by the Greens and they aren\u2019t going to be told what to do by suits out of the Greens movement in inner-city Melbourne and Sydney.\u201d But compounding Dutton\u2019s challenge is that he\u2019s not alone among Queensland LNP MPs whose seats are in danger. That\u2019s why Morrison spent part of November travelling across the state, why the Coalition will base its federal campaign office in Brisbane, and why the entire cabinet will hit the sunshine state in the coming days. Labor has identified eight of the Coalition\u2019s 21 Queensland seat as potentially winnable \u2013 Leichhardt, Flynn, Bonner, Petrie, Dickson, Capricornia, Forde and Dawson, with Brisbane considered a maybe. Luke Howarth\u2019s personal popularity in Petrie is expected to withstand any anti-government spin and Warren Entsch\u2019s decision to go round one last time is thought to have saved Leichhardt. It has the Coalition spread thin and it has taken a while for the LNP, and for Dutton, to catch on to Labor\u2019s local messaging. While tough on border security may play well at a macro level, it\u2019s parking, roads and roundabouts that win votes in Brisbane\u2019s northern suburbs. That\u2019s meant the man who launched a prime ministerial bid by telling Australia he hoped to be able to show more of his smile, now shares that turtle-who-lost-his-shell bemusement from billboards in his electorate. The Duttsmobile is back on the road \u201ctalking about the local issues\u201d. You want strong borders and a new parking lot? Get you an MP who can do both. But with the state Labor government having stepped in to solve local issues, complete with Labor branding, as often as possible, it hasn\u2019t left Dutton with a lot of ammunition. And yet, despite two-and-a-half years of campaigning, no one seems sure of whether or not Dickson is done. \u201cLook, the swing is on, that\u2019s just a fact,\u201d another LNP strategist says. \u201cHe\u2019s got visibility across the country, but it\u2019s not all positive. He\u2019s not as well-known in the electorate, and that\u2019s not all negative. His name is recognisable and that will help. But it\u2019s not that many votes to turn, and Labor and GetUp and the Greens and every union you can think of have been hitting this seat with all they\u2019ve got, and they are enjoying it. He\u2019s not. That\u2019s obvious.\u201d Labor is holding its cards closer. In a habit established following the 2013 election, campaigners as a whole talk down chances, so that victories, when they occur, seem even bigger. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure about Dickson and that\u2019s the truth,\u201d one Labor campaigner says. \u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near a sure thing. But it\u2019s closer than [Dutton] would want. We\u2019re keeping him on his toes, and we\u2019re doing it with old-fashioned campaigning. We\u2019ve got the time and the inclination and the resources. If we manage to win the federal election and topple Dutton? That\u2019s just icing for us in Queensland.\u201d Dutton himself has had to soften his image, now announcing policies, as with the recent proposal for a national sex offender public register, as \u201cnot too hard and not too soft\u201d. The Goldilocks approach to policy is in marked difference to the man who once publicly declared certain news organisations as being \u201cdead\u201d to him, because he didn\u2019t like their reports. A Dutton under electoral pressure is a Dutton who wants to know what everyone thinks. The LNP may think Dutton himself is one of the strongest elements to its campaign. But Labor thinks the same thing. Just for their own campaign. \u201cHas this campaign been perfect? No. No campaign is,\u201d another Labor campaigner says. \u201cAnd we may not pull it off. But you know what will be better than seeing Dutton in the opposition benches? Not seeing Dutton across the benches at all. And best of all, it will be for no other reason than he did it himself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
