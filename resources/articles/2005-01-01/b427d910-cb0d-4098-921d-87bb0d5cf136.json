At these levels the company is valued just shy of \u00a3360m. Yet again bid speculation did the rounds, with traders reckoning the company is a tasty morsel for a logistics player. There was also talk that Business Post has secured a contract with mobile phone operator Vodafone to deliver handsets across the country. A spokesman for Vodafone, however, denied that Business Post has such a contract. The stock was also supported, however, by a positive note from the company's house broker, Arbuthnot. The broker met with TNT Mail on Tuesday for an update on its UK business and said that, comparing the company's estimates with its forecasts for UK Mail, the Business Post unit, \"we conclude that our forecasts look sensible and that TNT are forecasting a faster ramp-up in volumes than we are for UK Mail.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
