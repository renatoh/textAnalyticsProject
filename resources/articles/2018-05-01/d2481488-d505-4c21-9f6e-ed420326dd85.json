Jones expects South Africa to be highly motivated because of \u201ccultural issues\u201d between the countries, highlighting a \u201cdislike of the English\u201d, but is sticking to his stated aim of a 3-0 series win next month. Any win would do at the moment. The 63-45 defeat by the Barbarians on Sunday was a fourth successive defeat under Jones but it was the embarrassing nature of it \u2013 never before have England conceded more points at Twickenham \u2013 that gave cause for concern. Jones is putting great faith in the return of 15 players from Exeter and Saracens, singling out the Vunipola brothers, Maro Itoje and his new captain, Owen Farrell, for their performances in the Premiership final on Saturday, but acknowledged they will need to be \u201cre-educated\u201d to England\u2019s tactical approach, which he says has changed since the Six Nations. Jones will also be giving history lessons, attempting to hammer home the reasons why England have won only three of their 13 matches away against South Africa, the most recent in 2000. South Africa have renewed optimism under their new coach, Rassie Erasmus, who has recalled five players based overseas including Sale\u2019s Faf de Klerk and Wasps\u2019 Willie le Roux , and who on Monday made one of the most significant appointments in the Springboks\u2019 history, naming Siya Kolisi as their first black captain. The Springboks have been beaten by England only once since 2006 but Jones, who was on the coaching staff for South Africa\u2019s 2007 World Cup triumph and masterminded Japan\u2019s 2015 World Cup victory against the Springboks, has claimed he knows their \u201crugby psyche\u201d as well as anyone. \u201cIt always comes down to the fact the first thing you\u2019ve got to do is beat history. History shows England have never won a series in South Africa,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably understand the South African rugby psyche as well as any having had experiences there. And I know what they are going to be like when they play England. There are certain cultural issues between the two countries that provide great motivation for the South Africans.\u201d Jones is expecting a fearsome welcome in Johannesburg for the first Test on 9 June but believes England can use that against the Springboks. \u201cYou have to be able to exploit that and use it in a positive way. How can you use their dislike of the English to create an opportunity for yourself because you know at Ellis Park they will be unbelievably passionate and aggressive for the first 20 minutes. That creates opportunities for us. We have to be good enough to understand those opportunities and execute them. \u201cFirst it is about creating an understanding of [the history]. They need to understand why English teams haven\u2019t won there in the past and then come up with an approach of how we will be ourselves. Like in any game of rugby, any physical contact sport, you have to understand the psychology of the opposition. You have to understand where they get their strength from.\u201d Tom Curry, one of the few players to emerge with credit from the record\u2011breaking defeat against the Barbarians, also knows what to expect against the Springboks. The 19\u2011year\u2011old, who has played in South Africa for England Under-18s, said: \u201cAt every age group South Africans just want to smash the English. It is what it is. You know what they are going to bring.\u201d Jones will finalise his 34-man squad on Tuesday and will name replacements for the injured Jack Willis and Cameron Redpath. Nathan Hughes and Piers Francis are the most likely additions while Willis\u2019s absence means Curry appears to be the frontrunner for the No 7 jersey in the first Test on 9 June in Johannesburg. \u201cEddie is pretty clear about what he wants from a seven. I just try to fit into the seven role in the team structure,\u201d Curry said. \u201cJust make sure I have speed at the breakdown and link the play. And work as hard as possible. Seven has got to be the hardest working player on the pitch. I am just going around busting a gut.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
