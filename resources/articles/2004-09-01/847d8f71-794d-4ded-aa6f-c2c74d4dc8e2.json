The book Once Upon a Poem: Favourite Poems that Tell Stories Illustrated by Peter Bailey, Sian Bailey, Carol Lawson and Chris McEwan Chicken House Price \u00a314.99 Age 8-12 yrs This is a very beautiful book, illustrated in full colour throughout, in a generous format that enables groups of children to enjoy it. It contains a most interesting mix of poetry, chosen by some of today's best writers for young people, names with which many children will be familiar. Each writer provides a brief reason for having made that particular choice. The book combines some irresistible insights into writers' tastes, with a varied and fascinating collection of longer narrative poems. Eva Ibbotson selected the simple but telling The Grateful Dragon by Raymond Wilson, while Eoin Colfer chooses Roald Dahl's anarchic Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The three American writers, Sharon Creech and Avi and Mary Pope Osborne, picked classics from their side of the Atlantic - Longfellow, Robert Service and Eugene Field - while Morris Gleitzman introduced AB \"Banjo\" Paterson, though not Waltzing Matilda, for which he is perhaps known. Teachers will find much to inspire them in Kevin Crossley-Holland's introduction. He eloquently trumpets the glories of narrative poetry, and what follows proves him right. The CD-rom Digital Worlds GIS Digital Worlds International Ltd Price \u00a3495 plus VAT Age 7-11 yrs This CD-rom contains digital data about places and environments across a 10km square centred round a location selected by the purchaser. The software includes Ordnance Survey maps, historical maps, aerial photographs, census data (2001) and satellite images. The program also allows the user to import other images and diagrams. This package has been designed to allow users to integrate sources of local information (eg maps, photos and statistics). This is potentially a cross-curricular tool and could be used to support cross-curricular or themed work, but the software does include lesson plans for primary teachers referenced to learning outcomes and the national curricula for maths, English, geography, history, ICT and citizenship. Its potential is almost limitless. The primary lesson ideas are all excellent. The quality of all maps (historical and modern), photos and satellite images is excellent. Census data is presented logically and clearly. It is simple to load and with practice almost all pupils were able to layer maps and aerial photographs with ease. It is a very straightforward process to select a map or photograph and simply drag it on to the viewer for displaying. This piece of software proved to be motivating and absorbing, since the children were able to look at and pose questions about their own locality. This is an excellent piece of software, combining features available elsewhere in a unique and powerful way.
