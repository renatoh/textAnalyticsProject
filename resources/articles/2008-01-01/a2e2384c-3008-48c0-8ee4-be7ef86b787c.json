It's a bit limp, but at least he has one: you have to have sat in a few times successfully to be granted such status. Poor Liza Tarbuck, covering so splendidly for Steve Wright at the moment, has only a bog-standard, ultra-bland Radio 2 jingle to play. Fingers crossed that in 2008 she gets a regular slot, and a suitably spirited bespoke jingle, on the station. On yesterday's show, Ball did his best to whip up some end-of-year atmosphere. His delivery fell a little flat in places - at times he sounds as if he is talking to an elderly relative who is hard of hearing - but he is great fun with guests (he called Imelda Staunton \"a miserable trout\" for choosing sad songs to play) and with the listeners. They phoned in with tales of bizarre and disastrous celebrations they had undertaken to see in past new years. One woman explained how, with no invitations to parties one year, she and her husband had a pretend shindig, and dressed their dog up in a blonde wig. \"We pretended to greet imaginary guests,\" she said, \"and did lots of jumping around to make it look busy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
