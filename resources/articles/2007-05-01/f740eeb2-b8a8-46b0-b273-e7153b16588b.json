Many will regard the lie - Lord Browne's claim that he met Jeff Chevalier while exercising in Battersea Park - as trivial. Mr Justice Eady did not. He said the lie persisted for two weeks and he spoke of Lord Browne's \"willingness casually to 'trash' the reputation of Mr Chevalier and to discredit him in the eyes of the court\". The judge's opinion was that he \"should certainly be careful in taking anything that the claimant [Lord Browne] says at face value or in accepting too readily from him that any particular story is inherently unlikely\". As an assessment of character, that is damning. No chief executive of a serious public company could survive it. Lord Browne's resignation was inevitable. For BP itself, the question is whether Lord Browne abused his position during the relationship. Peter Sutherland, the chairman, says that matter has been investigated and that the allegations of misuse of company assets and resources are \"unfounded or insubstantive\". That will probably satisfy shareholders. There will be little appetite to explore the arrangement by which two BP executives helped to set up and eventually wind up a mobile phone ringtone company created by Lord Browne for Chevalier to run. Most investors would probably also file that under \"insubstantive\", though very strange too. At worst, investors might conclude that the detail tends to confirm the impression that BP, in Lord Browne's later years, had become a company where the so-called Sun King dazzled all around him. But there's nothing much new in that idea. On the wider issue of whether Lord Browne's downfall will make it harder to be openly gay and run a big British company, we should be careful not to jump to conclusions. The point here is surely that Lord Browne's boardroom colleagues were fully aware of his sexuality for years, as were large sections of the media, the City and the business world. The matter was so unremarkable that Chevalier attended Downing Street dinners and accompanied Lord Browne on business trips. To repeat, it was the lie under oath that brought down BP's chief executive. As for Lord Browne himself, the court case is clearly damaging - to his wallet and his reputation. He will forgo salary and bonus totalling \u00a33.5m and share options potentially worth \u00a312m. That is a lot of money, even for a well paid executive with a big pension pot. The judge's comments will also make it impossible for him to land a chairman's job at a large public company. Yet one suspects it is not the end of the world for Lord Browne, professionally speaking. The world of arts in Britain, where he is active, is one possibility. Private equity, which was a possible avenue after his planned departure in July, may well still be welcoming. If not, the reluctance will owe more to fear of fall-out from BP's on-going legal battles in the US over the Texas City explosion, where 15 lost their lives and 100 were injured. Paper tigers Bidding for ABN Amro is clearly bad for your share price. The value of Barclays' paper has fallen so far that its all-share offer for the Dutch bank, billed as \u20ac36.25 a share, is now worth a little less than \u20ac35. Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland's shares yesterday closed at \u00a319.08, their lowest level for five months. Over in Spain and Belgium, Santander and Fortis are similarly suffering as the market anticipates the mountain of paper that will have to be issued to finance the consortium's adventure. So far, the damage is not life-threatening to either bid. Falls of 5% or so can be tolerated, and all sets of managements will console themselves that they haven't yet had a chance to promote their visions to investors. Yet none of these banks can afford to see another 5% disappear from their valuations. In Barclays' case, its offer would start to look very limp indeed, and leave the goal wide open to the consortium, which plans to pay 70% in cash and bid \u20ac39 a share. As for RBS, which wants to divvy up the other 30% in the form of its own shares, the implied lack of confidence from its own shareholders would become embarrassing. We are not there yet, but these share price movements are a reminder that, however thrilling the chase, the takeover of ABN is meant to be about the long-term creation of shareholder value. It's not yet clear that either bidder has a truly compelling case. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
