Calzaghe, who produced 12 scintillating rounds of boxing to beat American star Jeff Lacy earlier this year, was unimpressive againt his African opponent, even more so after a cut opened up above his left eye at the end of the fourth round. The Welsh fighter, who won with a unanimous points decision, told ITV1: \"I'm disappointed with the performance, I couldn't get off the way I would have liked to get off, but a win is a win. I'm disappointed, I wanted to put on a spectacle. He was a dirty fighter, he got caught a lot with (using) the head. I wasn't 100% tonight and it showed. He continued, \"I probably didn't get my tactics right, I was a bit too hasty to start with.\" Promoter Frank Warren was also critical, he said, \"I am upset with him especially when he was showboating and dropping his hands, I don't like that. Joe is a tremendous boxer but he was hampered by that cut. One thing you can't doubt with Joe Calzaghe is he has a fighter's hearts.\" However, Warren insists a springtime super-fight is still very much in the offing for Calzaghe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
