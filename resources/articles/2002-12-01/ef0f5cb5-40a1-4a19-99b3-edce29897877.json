More than 13 million viewers tuned in to BBC1 at 8pm to witness Little Mo's hen night and hear the latest on Jamie, who was mown down in Thursday's episode. Almost 8 million stayed tuned for Test the Nation, the topical quiz that last night pitted a team of secretaries against hairdressers, rugby players, parents, teenagers and celebrities. One in three viewers watched the show, hosted by Anne Robinson and Philip Schofield, at 8.30pm last night, putting the BBC neck and neck with ITV1's The Bill. But ITV1's ratings plummeted once the police soap ended. Z Cars - After They Were Famous, a nostalgic look back at the cop show that first hit our screens in the 1960s, managed just 4 million viewers and an 18% share. BBC1 held onto its lead for the rest of the evening, with the 10pm news pulling in 7.9 million viewers and a 36% share while the second part of Test the Nation managed 7.7 million. BBC2's Cruise of the Gods, a one-off comedy drama featuring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as faded TV celebrities, put in a respectable performance with 2.1 million viewers, beating Channel 4's Michael Caine documentary with 1.7 million. But BBC2 got its best ratings for the oft-repeated Christmas special of The Good Life, first shown 25 years ago. The Good Life: Silly, But It's Fun, in which Margo and Jerry enjoy Christmas with the Goods after their Christmas delivery fails to turn up, attracted 3.5 million viewers and a 14% share. ITV1 buried Stan the Man, the comedy flop starring Cold Feet's John Thomson, at 11pm last night with predictable results. The show managed just 1.5 million and was trounced by Test the Nation on BBC1 and even got beaten by a repeat of Never Mind the Buzzcocks, which pulled in 1.6 million for BBC2. Finally, both the BBC and Channel 5 scored hits with their very different version of Charles Dickens' famous Christmas Carol. Channel 5 managed a respectable 1.6 million for yesterday's afternoon screening of Scrooge, the classic musical adaptation of the tale starring Albert Finney and Alec Guinness. And almost 3 million viewers watched BBC1's late-night showing of Scrooged, a comedy about a mean-spirited TV executive starring Bill Murray."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
