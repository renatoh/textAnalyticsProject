But at last the island on which these souls were held captive is to have an airport. Saint Helena's airport will inevitably change life on, and the unique environment of, one of the world's remotest islands. At 1,200 miles from Africa \u2013 the nearest port is in southern Angola \u2013 and 1,800 miles from South America, the UK overseas territory is literally in the middle of nowhere. The prospect of a two-day rather than a two-week trip to the UK must surely appeal to most \"Saints\", as well as arrest population decline. It must at least be possible to have modern communications without concreting over the flora and fauna whose diversity astonished Darwin. The first passengers are not due to arrive until 2016, which means that Napoleon misses out both ways. The 200th anniversary of his arrival will have come and gone by then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
