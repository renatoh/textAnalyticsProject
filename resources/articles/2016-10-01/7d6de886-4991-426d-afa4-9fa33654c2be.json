The Police Service of Northern Ireland initially confirmed that a man had been shot and had sustained serious injuries at about 8.15pm in Poleglass, an area in the west of the city, and that he had been taken to hospital. However, local and security sources later told the Guardian that the man had died from his injuries. He was believed to be in his early 60s. The victim was shot at Glenwood Court, around the corner from Glenwood Drive where on Sunday night another man was shot, sustaining up to six bullet wounds to his legs. The dissident republican paramilitary group Oghlaigh na hEireann released a statement admitting responsibility for Sunday night\u2019s attack. In their communique they claimed to have attempted to murder another man in the same area whom they accused of dealing heroin in west and north Belfast. The 56-year-old victim of Sunday\u2019s shooting was from Ardoyne in north Belfast. Condemning Thursday\u2019s shooting, Alex Attwood, a member of the Northern Ireland assembly for the Social Democratic and Labour party, said such a \u201csavage assault had no place in our past and they have no place in our society today\u201d. \u201cThis is a very small group of people, unrepresentative of the local community, who have now repeatedly taken the law into their own hands,\u201d Attwood said. \u201cThe best response that we can make is to provide information to law enforcement and ensure that these individuals are caught, arrested and prosecuted under the full weight of the law.\u201d Speaking at the scene of the shooting, Jennifer McCann, a Sinn F\u00e9in member of the Northern Ireland assembly for Belfast West, said: \u201cI condemn the murder of a man who was shot dead in his home in Poleglass tonight. This brutal killing has achieved nothing other than plunging another family into grief and despair.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
