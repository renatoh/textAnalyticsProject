Andrew Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey unveiled the joint policy, which goes beyond federal rules set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as officials indicated the Obama administration was considering a similar rule throughout the US. The governors acted after the hospitalisation in New York of Craig Spencer, a 33-year-old doctor who was infected with the virus while treating patients in Guinea, one of the three west African countries worst affected by Ebola. Aid charities had previously warned that a quarantine rule would deter American doctors from travelling to Africa to help tackle the Ebola crisis. Yet the governors told a press conference in New York on Friday afternoon that they were unsatisfied with a self-monitoring system that had allowed Spencer to travel around crowded parts of the city such as the subway system, a restaurant and a bowling alley, after being infected. Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, said: \u201cWe\u2019re just not comfortable with the concept of voluntary quarantine as an effective public health security measure.\u201d He stressed that the CDC had made clear states were entitled to set tougher rules of their own. Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, said he was prepared to take \u201cwhatever steps were necessary to ensure the public health\u201d amid the ongoing risk of Ebola. \u201cNew Jersey and New York are going to determine the standards of quarantine, since CDC\u2019s guidance is continually changing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to set a standard for our two states.\u201d The quarantine rule is expected to apply to anyone, including healthcare workers, who came into contact with people infected with Ebola in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone. All travellers entering the two states through Newark and JFK international airports after being in the countries suffering from Ebola outbreaks will have their health monitored by state authorities. Christie said that a woman not showing any symptoms of an Ebola infection was quarantined at Newark airport earlier on Friday. Christie said that the woman was a healthcare worker who had been treating patients with Ebola and had travelled to the US from Sierra Leone. She was said to have been heading for New York via the New Jersey airport. Asked whether authorities held concerns about the woman\u2019s health, Christie said: \u201cNone that I\u2019m currently aware of.\u201d Asked where exactly inside the airport the woman was being held, the governor told reporters that he did not know, adding: \u201cNot in the United lounge\u201d. The announcement by Cuomo and Christie appeared to take senior New York City officials, who have been overseeing the treatment of Spencer, by surprise. The mayor of New York, Bill De Blasio, told a press conference earlier on Friday that American medical professionals helping to tackle the outbreak in west Africa \u201care the people who will end this crisis\u201d. He said: \u201cWe have to make sure that that flow of medical personnel can continue.\u201d Asked only a few hours before the state quarantine was announced whether such a policy was necessary, De Blasio said: \u201cI think at this point the pieces we have put in play are the right ones\u201d. Doctors Without Borders, which Spencer had been working for in Guinea, said earlier on Friday that a quarantine on medics returning from Ebola-stricken countries would be an \u201cexcessive measure\u201d. A spokesman for the organisation, known internationally as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), did not immediately return a request for comment on the New York-New Jersey policy. Amid calls for tougher action from Obama, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, declined during a briefing on Friday to rule out a nationwide quarantine program for returning healthcare workers. Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, told Reuters that a nationwide quarantine was indeed one option being discussed by administration officials. \u201cThere are a number of options being discussed pertaining to the monitoring and mobility of healthcare workers who are returning to the United States from affected countries,\u201d Skinner said. Spencer had finished his work in Guinea on 12 October and left the country on 14 October, flying home to John F Kennedy airport in New York via Europe. He arrived in New York on 17 October. Guidelines set out by MSF state that returning medics should stay within four hours of a hospital with isolation facilities, but do not require that they avoid crowds, so long as they do not display symptoms. \u201cAs long as a returned staff member does not experience any symptoms, normal life can proceed,\u201d the organisation says. \u201cFamily, friends, and neighbors can be assured that a returned staff person who does not present symptoms is not contagious and does not put them at risk. Self-quarantine is neither warranted nor recommended when a person is not displaying Ebola-like symptoms.\u201d Officials offered more details about Spencer\u2019s recent movements in New York. On Tuesday, he visited the High Line park where he stopped at the Blue Bottle coffee stand, and ate at the Greenwich Avenue branch of the Meatball Shop restaurant. On Wednesday, he took a three-mile jog on Riverside Drive, near his home, rode the subway to the Gutter bowling alley in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn and took an Uber cab home, all before he began to display symptoms, officials said. Spencer began to feel feverish on Thursday between 10am and 11am. He contacted Doctors Without Borders immediately, which in turn contacted the New York department of health. Officials organised for him to be transported to Bellevue hospital in the city, a designated site for Ebola patients, under strictly controlled conditions. Health officials said that Spencer declared a fever of 100.3F (38C), not the 103F originally reported. The mistake in the announcemnet was made because of a transcription error, they said, stressing that the lower-grade fever made it even less likely that New Yorkers would have been at risk from Spencer in the previous few days. Mary Bassett, the city health commissioner, said that Spencer was in a stable condition in an isolation unit at Bellevue, where he was taken in an ambulance my fully protected medical teams on Thursday. Spencer\u2019s fiancee, Morgan Dixon, and two of their friends, are in a 21-day quarantine. They are not permitted to leave the undisclosed location where they are staying and will have their health monitored twice daily. Bassett said Spencer was in a stable condition at Bellevue, where doctors were considering whether to offer any of the experimental treatments that have been tried on other Ebola patients in the US. Meanwhile a privately contracted crew of environmental and hazardous material cleaners arrived at the apartment that Spencer shared with his fiancee. De Blasio urged New Yorkers not to be concerned. \u201cThere is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way,\u201d he said, stressing that Ebola is very difficult to contract. \u201cIt cannot be transmitted through casual contact, it cannot be transmitted through an airborne fashion,\u201d De Blasio said. Outside Spencer\u2019s apartment in Harlem, the area\u2019s city councilman Mark Levine was on the scene to try to reassure neighbours that they were safe. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misconception out there, and people are scared understandably,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have to understand that you don\u2019t catch this by walking by someone or sitting next to them on the subway or jogging by them in the park.\u201d Some were unconvinced. \u201cThis entire neighbourhood is worried,\u201d said Stan Malone, who said he lived across West 147th Street from Spencer. \u201cPeople want to know why they haven\u2019t quarantined his entire building yet. Ebola is here in the city and you can bet this won\u2019t be the last case.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
