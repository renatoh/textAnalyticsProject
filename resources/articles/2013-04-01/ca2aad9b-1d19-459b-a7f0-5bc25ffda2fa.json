With home fans desperately calling for the final whistle after the five minutes of added time were up, Foster deflected Tomasz Cywka's shot beyond the stranded David Marshall. Cue gasps of despair among the home fans followed by anger when the game ended straight after the restart. Mackay, in fairness, accepted the explanation that the referee, Fred Graham, gave him after the match. \"I just wanted the referee to clarify where the extra time came from, which he did,\" Cardiff's manager said. \"He said it was for Kevin McNaughton going down. When they scored, he said he was going to blow the whistle four seconds later. So I was fine with that.\" Mackay's frustration was mainly reserved for his players, who dominated for long periods and should have put the game beyond a limited Barnsley side long before the drama of Foster's goal. Leading through Ben Turner's first goal of the season, Cardiff saw Heidar Helguson waste two excellent chances to extend Cardiff's lead. The substitute profligatelyheaded a Tommy Smith cross wide and also failed to beat Luke Steele when clean through in the 90th minute. \"We had chances. We should have been more clinical,\" Mackay said. \"At 1-0 anything can happen and a freak goal does happen.\" Disappointing as this result was for Cardiff, the reality is that they remain on course to secure a place in the Premier League. This point means there is no chance of that happening on Saturday, when Cardiff host Nottingham Forest, but with a nine-point lead over third-placed Watford and only five games remaining, it seems like a matter of when and not if they end their 51-year wait to return to the top flight. \"We had a good chat in the dressing room and I said to the players: 'You're a point closer to getting the prize that everyone at the football club wants,'\" Mackay said. Turner's breakthrough goal, stabbed in rather scrappily from Kim Bo-kyung's corner, came after a one-sided first half in which Craig Bellamy hit an upright and Jordon Mutch drew a fine save from Steele with an angled drive. The failure to turn possession into more goals proved their undoing, however, when Foster fortuitously beat Marshall with almost the last kick of the game. For Barnsley, who are scrapping for their lives at the other end of the table, the point could prove hugely significant. It lifts them to 19th place, above Wolverhampton Wanderers, and two points clear of the relegation zone. \"I think it's more than a point tonight,\" David Flitcroft, their manager, said. \"To see the players go for 97 minutes against the champions elect, you can't ask for any more. We'll have a real bounce from this result.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
