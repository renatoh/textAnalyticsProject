She was aware, of course, of the extraordinary public interest surrounding this high-stakes case that last week triggered a political firestorm at the Department of Justice over fears of political influence. In recent weeks, Jackson said, there have been letters and calls to the chamber, op-eds in every major newspaper, hours of punditry on cable news, and, perhaps most remarkable of all, a stream of tweets from the president of the United States, who has attacked her as biased. \u201cThe only people who think this is easy [are] the people who don\u2019t have to make the decision,\u201d she lamented from the bench. Stone\u2019s presence in her courtroom on Thursday had nothing to do with his political views or personal association. He was there, Jackson said, because \u201cRoger Stone characteristically inserted himself smack in the middle of one of the most incendiary issues of the day\u201d. His sentence had nothing to do with \u201cwho his friends are or who his enemies are,\u201d Jackson said. At issue, she explained, is only what he has been convicted of: attempting to sabotage a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cHe was not prosecuted for standing up for the president,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was prosecuted for covering up for the president.\u201d She laced into the defense offered by Stone\u2019s attorneys in response to his conviction on charges that he lied to congressional investigators and attempted to block the testimony of a witness, which she said amounted to: \u201c\u2018So what?\u2019\u201d \u201cOf all the circumstances in this case, that may be the most pernicious,\u201d Jackson said, in comments that quickly traveled far beyond the E Barrett Prettyman courthouse in Washington. \u201cThe truth still exists, the truth still matters.\u201d Stone stood unflinching, hands clasped in front of him, as she continued her excoriation. \u201cRoger Stone\u2019s insistence that it doesn\u2019t \u2026 his belligerence, his pride in his own lies, are a threat to our most fundamental institutions, to the very foundation of our democracy,\u201d she said emphatically. The judge forcefully rejected claims by Stone and his supporters that law enforcement was carrying out a political vendetta against the president by prosecuting his longtime friend. \u201cThere was nothing unfair, phony, or disgraceful about the investigation or the prosecution,\u201d she said. Jackson has overseen several of the high-profile cases stemming from the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, including the prosecutions of Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman and Rick Gates, his former deputy campaign chairman. But Stone\u2019s case \u2013 which turned in part on a Godfather reference, alleged threats made against a therapy dog and a series of profane texts messages that Jackson read from the bench on Thursday \u2013 was perhaps the most colorful. She accepted that Stone had cultivated a reputation as an \u201cagent provocateur\u201d who is belligerent and hyperbolic \u2013 noting humorously that these are descriptions of him from \u201cpeople who wrote [to the court] on his behalf\u201d. \u201cThe problem is that nothing about this case was a joke. It wasn\u2019t funny, it wasn\u2019t a stunt,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe defendant lied about a matter of great national and international significance. This is not campaign hi-jinks. This is not just Roger being Roger.\u201d The prosecution team had originally recommended a sentence of seven to nine years, which Trump decried earlier this month as \u201chorrible and unfair\u201d. Almost immediately, William Barr, the attorney general, intervened and overruled the prosecutors, recommending a far more lenient sentence. Jackson called the what the justice department did \u201cunprecedented\u201d. In what appeared to be a reference to the president\u2019s running Twitter commentary on the case, Jackson said: \u201cThe court cannot be influenced by those comments. They were entirely inappropriate.\u201d Nevertheless, she believed the initial recommendation was unduly punitive. Probation, however, would not fit the gravity of the crimes committed, she said. In the end, she arrived at her decision: Stone would be sentenced to 40 months in prison. But the case is not quite closed. Stone would not be imprisoned until the judge rules on a motion brought by his defense team requesting a new trial. Emerging from the courthouse after his sentencing, Stone looked bemused by the media frenzy. He was, after all, a man who believed the \u201conly thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\u201d But there was no flamboyant displays, no Nixon-esque victory salute. He simply placed a hat atop his head and slipped into a waiting car. After the sentencing, a representative for Stone appealed to Trump directly. \u201cIt falls on President Trump to use the power of a pardon as the final means of checks and balances to right this horrible wrong,\u201d the spokeswoman, Kristin Davis, said in a statement. Speaking in Las Vegas at a graduation ceremony for prisoners leaving incarceration on Thursday, Trump said he was following the case \u201c very closely\u201d. \u201cI want to see it play out to its fullest,\u201d he told the graduates, \u201cbecause Roger has a very good chance of exoneration, in my opinion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
