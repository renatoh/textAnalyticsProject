The track becomes a rambling tale of how God takes him \u201con that spaceship up to, y\u2019know, the funkiness\u201d; his voice, full of sensual braggadocio, booms out over the beat, where raw drums crash underneath a looping piano hook. It\u2019s one of the hip\u2013house genre\u2019s finest moments, a blend of dance and rap music that Dunn pioneered and is still pushing forward. He\u2019s just released his 2017 album, My House from All Angles, digitally for the first time, 29 years after his 1990 debut Free Your Mind. The ups and downs in the intervening years are a key part of house history. He grew up in Englewood, a black neighbourhood in south central Chicago. After graduating from high school in 1983 he started playing records in parks and community halls with fellow producer Tyree Cooper, among others, for kids who were \u201ctoo young and too poor\u201d to go to clubs in the city. He made a name for himself as a performer, turning up to parties with two reel-to-reel tape recorders and drum machines, playing live jams that he\u2019d rap and sing over. Without money to record and cut vinyl records, Dunn says it was cheaper and more fun to play this way, and it made him an instant draw. \u201cYou only heard my music if you came to my party,\u201d he says. When legendary club the Warehouse opened its second location in 1990, Dunn was invited to perform. Using vinyl records, reel-to-reel tapes and a pitch-controlled cassette deck, he produced live edits on the fly, creating a dramatic, multilayered sound. He ran three record labels with fellow Warehouse resident Armando: Dance Mutha, which focused on \u201cfunky hip\u2013house\u201d tracks, Warehouse \u201cfor the weirdos who couldn\u2019t get released on DJ International or Trax\u201d (the two biggest house labels of the time) and Muzique, for \u201cdeep house grooves with a touch of acid\u201d. For as long as Dunn had been producing house music he\u2019d been producing for rappers, too. But, says Dunn, \u201cNew York City ran the rap game and the Chicago house scene was crazy, so, apart from people like Twista, Crucial Conflict and Do Or Die, nobody wanted to do rap here.\u201d This is why he, Cooper and fellow producer Fast Eddie incorporated their love of funky rap vocals and hip\u2013hop beats into house grooves and came up with hip\u2013house, \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t taken seriously with rap\u201d. But word of his rap production, under the name the Incredible MD, eventually spread to the coasts. A bidding war started between Jimmy Iovine\u2019s Interscope Records and Sean \u201cPuffy\u201d Combs\u2019 Bad Boy Records. After choosing to sign with Bad Boy, Dunn\u2019s luck hit a wall. In December 1999, Combs and the rapper Shyne were arrested for their alleged roles in a New York City nightclub shooting. By the spring of 2001, Combs had been acquitted of all charges and Shyne sentenced to 10 years in prison. The tabloid drama created a domino effect at Bad Boy that tipped over Dunn\u2019s deal. \u201cWe never got to the point of releasing anything \u2026 because [Combs] was so concerned about going to jail,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cWe were waiting on the sidelines until he got finished, and when he did he basically got rid of [\u2026] anything that was in that period that was bad for him, and my label was part of that.\u201d He admits, though, that there was \u201cnot correct business on my end,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cI rubbed [Combs] the wrong way.\u201d After the deal collapsed, Dunn kept a low profile. \u201cI was in a real dismal place and I didn\u2019t want nobody seeing me,\u201d he says, \u201cso I went underground.\u201d He started playing at neighbourhood parties again and word spread of his return. \u201cWhen you come back out after a long time, people start appreciating you a little different,\u201d he says. In 2008, he released his most celebrated club track, Phreaky MF, but only after a long delay \u2013 he promised his grandmother that he wouldn\u2019t release it while she was alive, because she disapproved of its hardcore sexual lyrics. \u201cI needed something to play that night at the Warehouse,\u201d Dunn says, \u201cso I just threw the track together, went in the booth, and started talking crazy over it. Nothing was written down or rehearsed \u2013 just me freestyling some wild stuff.\u201d That wild stuff still turns heads in the club in 2019 \u2013 it regards exactly what this enthusiastic and adventurous lover, who goes by the name of Mr 69, would do to you, blending chocolate, whipped cream and saliva with much raunchier fare. His macho kind of sexual bravado has aged surprisingly well on record; the track is a favourite of DJs such as Four Tet, and has a sonic kinship with the low\u2013slung bombastic funk of groups like LCD Soundsystem. One of those who noticed his return was Wayne Williams, seasoned label A&amp;R and elder of the Chosen Few, a respected group of house DJs that Williams founded in the late 70s. In 2012, Dunn earned a new nickname, \u201cThe Baby,\u201d as only the second member to be invited to join in 30 years. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there\u2019s been a resurgence of house in Chicago, which was in dire straits before,\u201d says Dunn. He sees the growth of the Picnic, the Chosen Few\u2019s one\u2013day festival that draws upwards of 40,000 people to Chicago\u2019s Jackson Park each July, as a shot in the arm for the dance music community in the US. \u201cIt let people know that it was still alive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to get it back to where we were looked at as the birthplace of house, not the graveyard of it.\u201d My House from All Angles features a new, garage\u2013tinged remix of Phreaky MF, but it\u2019s the new tracks that really shine. Going back to those live jams that made his name in Englewood, he punches out tough rhythmic jams on the Roland equipment that defined the sound of Chicago house\u2019s first wave. Guiding the beats are his vocals, deeper and raspier than before. His personal favourite is the track Body Muzik. \u201cIt\u2019s got the funkiness, the old school rapping, the acid and the hard distorted vocals,\u201d he says. \u201cI just love it.\u201d God may have made him funky, but Mike Dunn has kept it going ever since. \u2022 My House from All Angles is out now on Defected / Classic Music Company"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
