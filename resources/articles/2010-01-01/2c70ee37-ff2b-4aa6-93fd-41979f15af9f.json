The Tottenham Hotspur manager has explored the possibility of re-signing Younes Kaboul from Portsmouth and he also has an interest in Palermo's Simon Kjaer, a Danish international who has an \u00a311m buy-out clause in his contact and is being chased by a host of leading clubs. Redknapp has only two fully fit centre-halves at present, Michael Dawson and S\u00e9bastien Bassong, and even one of his emergency options for the position, the midfielder Tom Huddlestone, is now injured. Huddlestone has needed to have fluid drained from his knee after recent matches and he will not play in the Premier League fixture at Liverpool on Wednesday night, amid concerns that he could yet require an operation. \"If I've only got two centre-halves and Ledley's long-term, it's going to be a problem, we'll have to look at it, for sure,\" Redknapp said. \"Tom could play there but if he's injured as well, that is the problem. Wilson Palacios could probably play there at a pinch but you wouldn't want to go and play 16-17 games with him at centre-half so it's something we're looking at again.\" King has made only 10 appearances this season as he manages his chronically damaged knee. He has no cartilage in the joint so, after he plays, the knee swells up to almost twice its normal size. It is well documented that he is barely able to train. Redknapp said that King had suffered a serious setback in a training-ground friendly against Grays Athletic on 8 December and, although he appeared against Fulham and West Ham United over the Christmas period, he has not played since 28 December. King trained \"eight or nine days ago\", according to Redknapp, but the knee was \"sore\". \"He's had an injection since then because it was quite painful,\" Redknapp continued, \"then another scan. But the scan didn't show any different to [what it was] before the injection.\" Redknapp had asked King to return to training on Tuesday morning. \"We had to do something, because he hasn't trained at all, to see if there is any chance of him being available against Liverpool. When he trains, you don't know how his knee will react. Just wait and see, really. It's a constant nightmare for him. \"He hurt it when he played against Grays. It was an absolute freak accident. He jumped, the ball hit him and it knocked him off balance as he was in mid-air. He landed and his knee jarred badly. It would have hurt anybody's knee, let alone when you've got a dodgy knee. It flared up worse since then.\" Redknapp said that he had an interest in signing the Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy but any deal this month depended on a number of factors, including whether he could sell the unsettled Roman Pavlyuchenko. \"I think Zenit St Petersburg have made contact with the chairman [over Pavlyuchenko],\" said Redknapp, \"but I don't know where it's at with that one. There have been one or two English clubs interested in him as well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
