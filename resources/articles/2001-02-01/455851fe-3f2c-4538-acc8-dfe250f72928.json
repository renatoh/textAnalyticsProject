We are together to play football, not for anything else. \"I am a Swede, so I am used to alcohol. But if you are a professional footballer you have to behave like a professional footballer, especially if you want to play for England.\" Eriksson also confirmed he will play with a four-man defence. \"I believe in a back four,\" he said. \"I have always played like that, and there are very few times when I have chosen to play with three central defenders. I think we will start with four at the back.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
