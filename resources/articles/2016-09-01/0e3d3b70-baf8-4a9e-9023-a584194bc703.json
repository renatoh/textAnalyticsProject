The deliberately shocking short films, to be broadcast from Friday, feature new work specially created for the radio station and include unconventional jazz sounds created by rapper and saxophonist Soweto Kinch, modern poetry from Alice Oswald and the deconstruction of a Beethoven late quartet into abstract electronic notes, courtesy of composer Matthew Herbert \u2013 also known as Doctor Rockit. They are intended to highlight new work commissioned by the station, which turns 70 years old on Thursday. The adverts conclude with the simple phrase, \u201cCommissioned by Radio 3\u201d. \u201cI was nervous but excited when I first saw these films,\u201d said Alan Davey, the station\u2019s controller. \u201cWe are demonstrating things about us that younger people don\u2019t know. They are very bold, arresting films and if some Radio 3 listeners complain about them I am just going to say this is what Radio 3 has always been about, pioneering sounds, right from when it started in September 1946 as the Third Programme.\u201d Davey said the campaign aims to let potential listeners know that the common misconception that Radio 3 is only for people who like music made by composers who have been dead for at least half a century is wrong, and always was wrong. It will also emphasise the amount of spoken word content and poetry the station puts out each week. \u201cThe main idea is to reach younger people who do not yet listen, and to shift their ideas, but I believe a lot of Radio 3 listeners are already curious about all sorts of music and will be happy that it is being given airtime,\u201d said Davey."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
