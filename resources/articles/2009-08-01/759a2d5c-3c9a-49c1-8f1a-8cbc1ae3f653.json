She's someone you want on your TV screen, but not in your life \u2013 one of those Apprentice-type people who has torn the word \"no\" out of her vocabulary. Positive thinking is what Hayley is all about, and she carries an AA battery around to remind people. \"You'll hear all about this the whole way through the next six weeks, until you're sick of the sight of batteries,\" she says, holding it up to her students. \"Positivity is the key to everything.\" I'm not sure how much better the positive end of the battery is than the negative end. Come to think of it, would a Hayley battery, positive at both ends, even work? But that's not the point (and frankly, it's a bit negative, so of no benefit to anyone). The class understand what she's saying. They are unemployed women in Doncaster, who have had children and are living on benefits. Hayley's course, called Elevate, will build their confidence and get them back to work. It's part of the government's attempt to revolutionise the welfare system, by paying private companies to get people into employment. Hayley works for a company called A4e, which is run by Emma Harrison, who lives in a big, fat house in the country with an indoor swimming pool. Emma seems to have done very nicely out of the unemployed, thank you very much. Hayley's got her work cut out. Some of her students aren't really getting the whole positivity thing. Dawn, who Hayley thinks is trying to justify not working, has run up debts of \u00a375,000, but still thinks she needs the top Virgin TV package, with all the cartoon channels. Then there's Donah, who likes a little drink of a morning, to take the edge off the day. Both Donah and Dawn end up in tears. But that's OK, Hayley knows how they feel. And part of it is about breaking people down so you can build them back up again. Elevate them. She's got them at pretty much rock bottom, so now she can get to work. \"Jump on board with me, because we can all go where we want to go,\" she says. Hayley has all the good lines. There's a nice analogy she uses about the life cycle of a butterfly; these women have been through the egg and caterpillar stages, but they've got stuck inside their chrysalises. She's going to help them break out, into beautiful butterfly ladies. That means no jeans, for starters. \"Sometimes, in order to be confident and to show confidence, we need a few little helping points, don't we?\" she tells them. Aren't we being a tiny bit patronising there, Hayley, talking to grown-ups as if they were five-year-olds. No? Because it's a dog-eat-dog world out there, and these women need to know what's going to give them the edge in order to maximise their opportunities? I see. And she's right, of course (\"wrong\" is another word that doesn't belong in the lexicon of Hayley). Her students tear up their jeans, they jump on board, and they break out of their chrysalises, tentatively at first, unsure of how to operate their new wings, but positively at least. And that, as we know, is the key to everything (though, if I'm really honest, I'm finding all this positivity quite tiring). At the end of the course they all get jobs \u2013 even Dawn and Donah \u2013 at Poundland. The system \u2013 private welfare companies, Hayley, Elevate \u2013 works. Well, it works for everyone except Yvette, who, with four kids, finds that a minimum wage from Poundland is no match for the benefits she was getting before. Even Hayley doesn't blame Yvette for quitting, which is out of character for Hayley, and means that there must be something wrong with the system. \"It just seems backwards, really,\" she says. I think we know which end of the battery she's talking about. So Yvette crawls back into her chysalis, the one negative in a story full of positives, while the others flutter happily and confidently around the Doncaster branch of Poundland. They're winners, all of them. Hayley, too, for getting them there. But perhaps the biggest winner of all is Emma Harrison, in her big, fat country house, who just got even richer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
