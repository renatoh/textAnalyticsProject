Chelsea\u2019s manager refused to discuss a potential title challenge after his team\u2019s fifth consecutive win and pointed out that Arsenal and Liverpool can overtake them with victories against Tottenham Hotspur and Watford, respectively, on Sunday. Conte wants Chelsea to focus on themselves and maintain their desire. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to send a message to the other teams,\u201d the former Juventus and Italy manager, who took over in the summer, said. \u201cIt is important to send a message to ourselves. I think it is important to be focused on our work, not to see the others\u2019. We want to improve. We are working a lot to improve. This is the right way, it is important the players recognise this way and continue, it is important to celebrate this victory but it is important to say that it is the past. Tonight we can see we are top. Tomorrow it can probably change. But it is not important. Today it was important to win and improve.\u201d Even so, Conte was delighted with his team. \u201cWhen you have this type of performance, you are very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we win this way and play good football, good intensity with and without the ball, it is great. We can improve our confidence. I am very pleased. When you win five games in a row and don\u2019t concede a goal, you can be satisfied.\u201d Eden Hazard scored twice and had a hand in all of Chelsea\u2019s goals. \u201cThe most important thing is Eden is fantastic with the ball and without the ball,\u201d Conte said of the Belgian. \u201cHe is working hard for the team. This type of commitment without the ball, I am satisfied.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
