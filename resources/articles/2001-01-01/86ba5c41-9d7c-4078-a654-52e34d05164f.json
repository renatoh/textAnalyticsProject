Family law specialist Dianne Miller, representing Alan and Judith Kilshaw who \"adopted\" the twins in the US, warned that a final decision on the fate of the is still \"some way off\". The six-month-old twins Belinda and Kimberley were taken in to care by Flintshire county council on Thursday night. Ms Miller that she would seek to get the twins \"home with the parents\", adding: \"My argument is: why is temporary foster care better than being with my clients?\" The twins had \"never been subjected to significant risk of harm\", said Ms Miller, who said she intends to hire adoption barrister Heather Swindells to take the case to the high court. \"She is a specialist in this kind of law. She will be going to the high court in Birmingham on Tuesday. Tuesday is the beginning - the end is some way off.\" At a news conference today, Mr Kilshaw read out a statement reacting to last night's events at the North Wales hotel where he and his wife have been staying. It said: \"Last night the twins, Belinda and Kimberley, were removed by Flintshire Social Services and taken into their care. \"It was my intention to challenge the order granting them consent to do that today but since that time it has now emerged that social services are intending to apply to the high court in Birmingham on Tuesday to make the children wards of court. \"I don't see that necessarily as a damaging step as far as our case is concerned. It will give us a breathing space for the court to decide the right outcome of the case,\" he added. Mr Kilshaw, when questioned about the six-month-old sisters' adoption certificates, said he was quite happy to make them \"public in due course\". Flintshire county council said the fate of the twins will be considered by the high court within the next nine days. Council chief executive Philip McGreevy said in a statement: \"The twins are safe and well in the council's care. \"Last night, in what was a careful, considered and proportionate response to the emerging circumstances, the council obtained an emergency protection order from a magistrate of the Flintshire family proceedings court. \"That magistrate heard and considered evidence presented by the council's QC. \"Further legal steps are now in hand which will place all of the issues, including the complex legal, practical and international dimensions, before the high court prior to the expiry of the emergency protection order on January 26.\" The council refused to comment further on the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
