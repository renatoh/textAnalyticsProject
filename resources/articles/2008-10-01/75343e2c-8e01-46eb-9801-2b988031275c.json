Olive oil from Sicily, and pagnotta bread, which is made with semolina. What would you have for your last supper? White truffle taglioni. What foodstuff would you put in Room 101? Truffle oil, because it's not actually made from truffles - it's an artificial flavouring and they actually put little bits in the bottom to make it seem like it's authentic. What's your favourite table? A restaurant in Verona called Il Pompiere [The Fireman]. They do amazing salumi misti and they have the best risotto amarone. What's your poison? Red wine - my favourite is barolo. Which book gets you cooking? Modern Italian Cooking by Biba Caggiano. What's your dream dinner party line-up? Elizabeth David, Norman Douglas, Kenny Dalglish and Raquel Welsh. What was your childhood teatime treat? Fruitcake made by my mum. What would you cook to impress a date? I would cook, um, probably white truffle taglioni, and a soft chocolate cake that we serve in the restaurant. Who would you most like to cook for? Elvis Presley. No! Can I take that back? He just ate hamburgers and milkshakes, he wouldn't be a discerning enough guest. I'll go for Elizabeth David - but I have actually cooked for her before. Can I have her? What was your most memorable meal? A restaurant in Monforte d'Alba in the barolo wine-producing area. It had an open fire and a kid (of the goat variety) roasting on the open hearth. The chef had picked a truffle that must have weighed about half a kilo and it was sitting there, all encrusted in mud with these wild flowers that had been picked from the hillside scattered around it. We had the most amazing meal and twelve of us ate all of the truffle. We had delicious pasta and delicious risotto. I've never had anything like it. What was your biggest food disaster? When I was trying to make choux buns for my wife. I thought I'd really impress her but they turned out like golf balls. She hasn't let me forget it. It's the sort of anecdote that comes up at the end of dinner parties! What's the worst meal you've ever had? It was a meal at a restaurant in Northern France that should have been pretty simple but was SO badly done \u2013 essentially entrec\u00f4te frites, but the chips were raw and cold and the steak I got was well done on one side and raw on the other. And the bottom of the steak looked like it had fallen on the floor. I remember looking at it and thinking, 'I'm not even going to try that'. What's the most outlandish thing you've ever eaten? Oh, I dunno, I've eaten sheep's testicles a few times at Lebanese restaurants. But nothing like monkey brains. Who's your food hero/food villain? Probably \u2026 Oooh, I've got so many \u2026 Alice Waters. My food villain is Findus Crispy Pancakes. Nigella or Delia? Nigella. I think she's a very sexy woman. Vegetarians: genius or madness? I think you have to say genius, really. I know a lot of chefs will think I'm an idiot, but if you think about Indian food, it's all vegetarian. Muesli or fry-up? It's got to be a fry-up. Starter or pudding? Starter. Fast food or fresh food? Fresh food. Fusion food or Best of British? Best of British. What's the best/worst thing about the British food scene? The best thing is the produce that we have and the way we use it. The worst is overcooking. What's the next big thing? This is a difficult one. A lot of people have been talking about Mexican food making a big comeback, or even Greek food. What would you do if you weren't a chef? I could have been a blacksmith - when I was a kid I was very interested in forges and I made all these things at school. I was really keen on the anvil and the forge, but I was always more interested in cooking. Make a wish That the whole of the world doesn't go into financial meltdown. \u2022 Theo Randall is head chef at the InterContinental.
