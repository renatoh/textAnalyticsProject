There has been an \"outcry\" at his appointment, according to this week's Jewish Chronicle, which claims in its editorial that the paper had come under \"considerable pressure from his associates and his lawyers not to give space to the debate - an odd position for a gentleman of the press to take\". We're sure it was just a misunderstanding. Reassuringly, it hasn't stopped the paper quoting liberally from some of Desmond's TV output. \"Uncontrollable adult filth,\" promises Red Hot Raw. \"The filthiest, dirtiest, kinkiest ... action.\" Desmond was unavailable for comment. \u00b7 Monkey is grateful to London's Evening Standard for last week's indispensable travel supplement, The Med Goes Upmarket. Just one question: isn't Tenerife - \"long seen as a tacky tourist destination for the egg and chip timeshare brigade\" - in the Atlantic? \u00b7 After the BBC chose for its World Cup theme a Handel tune commissioned to celebrate the most infamous massacre in Scottish military history, could ITV do any better? Apparently not. Young persons' beat combo Kasabian have been given the task of covering David Bowie's Heroes for the ITV World Cup campaign. Not exactly what you would call a football song, it is set in a cold war Germany in which two young lovers are separated by the Berlin Wall. Football fans might find some resonance with lines like \"I'll drink all the time\", but what about \"I wish you could swim like the dolphins\"? Presumably ITV didn't have the budget for a Posh and Becks duet. \u00b7 To the Ivor Novello awards, where Sunday Express editor Martin Townsend met his musical heroes Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, pioneers of the \"Philly sound\". Showing no shame, Townsend brought along a clutch of albums to sign in his Express-branded carrier bag, and apparently posed for more pictures than Monkey could shake a bunch of bananas at. Let's hope he remembered to get one signed \"for Richard\" or there might have been trouble when he got back to the office. \u00b7 Talking of which, the stars were out in full for a glittering bash to celebrate OK! magazine's 10th anniversary, where guests included Mohamed Al Fayed, ITV chief executive Charles Allen and Kym Marsh's mother-in-law. In what must surely be some kind of record, the shy and retiring Desmond is pictured at the party no fewer than 24 times in the latest edition of the gossip rag. Alas, in the absence of an OK! podcast, Monkey cannot report on the rumoured duet between Desmond's band the RD Crusaders and ... Peter Andre. \u00b7 New Today editor Ceri Thomas is getting ready to make some changes. Mindful of the sensitive nature of Radio 4 listeners (two words: UK Theme), Thomas has decided to ask them first. He says there is \"no case to be made for overnight revolution\", but will use the Today website as a sounding board so that \"we don't do things which come as an unpleasant shock to you, and you don't get bored when a failure to evolve makes us predictable\". Future innovations may include a representative panel of listeners to tell the programme where it's going right - and wrong. \u00b7 On the day the Press Complaints Commission published its annual report, Boris Johnson once again fell foul of its crackdown on the term \"illegal asylum seeker\" in his Daily Telegraph column. Johnson goes top of the offenders' league table, but his efforts can't topple the Daily Mail. Lib Dem culture spokesman Don Foster was unimpressed. \"While anyone can make a mistake,\" he said, \"it's disappointing that Mr Johnson's usual verbal dexterity has abandoned him more than once on this subject.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
