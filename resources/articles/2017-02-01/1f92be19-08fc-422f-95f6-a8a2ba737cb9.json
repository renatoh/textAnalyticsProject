On Saturday Fairfax Media reported a group of moderate MPs will call for reconsideration of a free vote on marriage equality in the next two weeks. Liberal moderate MPs are still working towards a bill on same-sex marriage to emerge from the Senate inquiry on the government\u2019s exposure draft, which will report on 13 February. Liberal senator Dean Smith, who has described the plebiscite policy as \u201cdead\u201d, and a group of moderates including Tim Wilson and Trent Zimmerman believe the government position must default to a free vote, as Tony Abbott said the 44th parliament would be the last to be bound on same-sex marriage. The call has drawn criticism from conservative figures Tony Abbott, George Christensen and Josh Frydenberg who have moved to shut it down, while others including the leader of the House, Christopher Pyne, seem open to it if and when a bill is produced. On Monday Morrison told a press conference in Canberra the issue was not a focus of the government and its policy remains a plebiscite. Asked about the moderates\u2019 push, Morrison replied: \u201cI will leave the fake news to others.\u201d On Monday Pyne told ABC\u2019s AM that Labor defeated the plebiscite bill \u201cin a very cutting off one\u2019s nose to spite one\u2019s face move\u201d. \u201cWe could\u2019ve had marriage equality after this Saturday, probably within a matter of weeks, if Labor hadn\u2019t been so bloody-minded.\u201d Pyne said there was \u201cno Coalition bill before the House at the moment to deal with marriage equality and until and if there is, it\u2019s a moot point\u201d. On Monday special minister of state, Scott Ryan told Radio National the government would not be distracted by gay marriage, adding that he \u201cspent a lot of time last year working on a comprehensive plebiscite proposal\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let [Labor and the Greens\u2019s] opportunism define Coalition policy,\u201d he said, citing Bill Shorten earlier saying he was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the prospect of a plebiscite. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to the plebiscite, I\u2019m committed to the plebiscite.\u201d Ryan said arguments against the plebiscite were \u201cabsolutely reprehensible\u201d because they amounted to saying the Australian people couldn\u2019t be trusted to conduct the debate responsibly. At a doorstop in Canberra addressing the possible break-away of Cory Bernardi to form a conservative party, Christensen said discussion of same-sex marriage was \u201cnot helpful\u201d and the government already had a policy. \u201cIf this government goes down the road of breaking its agreement with the people that we made that we were going to do to a plebiscite, then, you know, the show\u2019s over,\u201d he said. Asked to clarify, Christensen said issues like same-sex marriage made the government seem out of touch and it had to reconnect with its core constituency. Abbott has warned that abandoning the plebiscite in favour of a free vote would be breaking a promise. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has also backed the plebiscite, suggesting that Labor will \u201cinevitably blink\u201d and pass the bill. On Sunday Malcolm Turnbull said his party\u2019s policy was for a plebiscite, but did not detail how he would respond to the push by Liberal backbenchers for reconsideration of marriage equality in the party room. \u201cI took to the last election the policy of my party and my government which was to have a plebiscite,\u201d he told Channel Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes. \u201cWe are calling on Bill Shorten to rethink his position and if he supports the plebiscite, then it\u2019ll pass through the Senate, then it will be held and every Australian will have a say.\u201d A ReachTel poll commissioned by the Australians for Equality campaign, released on Monday, found that 62% of voters want their federal member to \u201cbe allowed to vote for same-sex marriage when the issues comes to parliament\u201d. That compared with 25% who opposed a free vote and 13% who were undecided. The poll of 4,742 residents in the Coalition-held electorates of Chisholm, Corangamite, Durak, Gilmore, LaTrobe, Murray and Page found that majorities in all seven seats wanted their MPs to have a free vote. Asked how it would affect their vote if the Coalition blocked a free vote, 18% said it made them more likely to vote for the Coalition, 41% said it made them less likely to and 41% said it wouldn\u2019t affect their vote. Asked how important it was to resolve same-sex marriage this year, 41% said it was \u201cvery important\u201d, 41% said it was \u201cnot important at all\u201d and 19% said it was \u201csomewhat important\u201d. The Australian Marriage Equality co-chairman, Alex Greenwich, told Radio National on Monday the \u201cpolitical reality is that [the plebiscite] is dead\u201d. \u201cThis was a policy that I don\u2019t think anyone is missing \u2013 it was not a popular policy.\u201d Greenwich said a new ad blitz by the marriage equality campaign would remind politicians that marriage equality is \u201cabout real people who aspire to marry the people they love in the country they love\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
