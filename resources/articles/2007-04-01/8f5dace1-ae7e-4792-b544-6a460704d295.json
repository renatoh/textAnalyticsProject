Portsmouth", "bodyText": "When a chubby Etonian tours a far-from-flush city in a \u00a3340,000 limousine, he should hardly expect the warmest of welcomes. As if to make sure that he would run into local defiance, Boris Johnson followed that up by making wisecracks about overweight locals. Yet the pride that Mr Johnson has unwittingly stirred is more than defensive, for this city has quite a CV. Richard the Lionheart raised a fleet here and then in return conferred a royal charter. Ever-after it was England's great naval launch pad, as it was 25 years ago this week when the Falklands taskforce set out. And more than with most cities, past glories live into the present, thanks to some extraordinary historic attractions. The painstakingly recovered and rebuilt Mary Rose is on show, not far from where this cherished flagship of Henry VIII sank and for so long sat trapped under the sea. HMS Warrior, the Royal Navy's first iron-hulled warship, still rules the waves in the dockyard, complete with the revolutionary citadel which armoured her guns. Greatest of all is Nelson's HMS Victory, with its low decks and its thick smell of timber which combine to create such atmosphere around the spot where the great admiral died. And even his great London column is now dwarfed by Portsmouth's own 170m Spinnaker Tower - a giant sail which stands proudly as a symbol of continuing sea-faring, now as much civilian as naval. With Boris seemingly blind to all of these wonders, he can hardly be surprised when the locals tell him to sling his hook."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
