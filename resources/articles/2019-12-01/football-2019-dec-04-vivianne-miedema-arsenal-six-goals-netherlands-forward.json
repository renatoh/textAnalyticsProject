Arsenal\u2019s 11-1 pounding of Bristol City became the highest-scoring game in Women\u2019s Super League history \u2013 surpassing Liverpool\u2019s 9-0 defeat of Doncaster Belles in 2014. A scoreline that emphatic often prompts talk of the collective clicking like never before, of teamwork triumphing. At Meadow Park that was true; the crisp instinctive passing, the movement of the midfield diamond, the high line and searing passes of the back three, made you drool. But there was a bigger story. An individual performance from the Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema that defies logic. By the 65th minute she had scored six goals and provided four assists. Yet she is a headline stealer who hates the headlines. \u201cI don\u2019t really think I\u2019ve played like that before,\u201d she said after her double hat-trick. \u201cI felt really good today and I was probably happier with my assists today. I felt really good and I\u2019m happy that I could help the team.\u201d Miedema is happier resting up for the next game than sitting alongside the footballing elite and being recognised as one of the best players in the world at the Ballon d\u2019Or awards. It is not just a shyness that prompts that attitude but an active dislike of individual awards. Ask her, as Arseblog\u2019s Tim Stillman did regarding her omission from the Fifpro World XI. \u201cI think we all know it\u2019s all about popularity and I don\u2019t post much on Instagram or Twitter, so that\u2019s probably what went wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about individual awards to be honest, but I think it\u2019s a joke.\u201d She had scored 22 goals in 20 games, 31 across all competitions. After eight league games this season she has 10 goals, 22 in all competitions. Atthe age of 23 she is the Netherlands\u2019 record goalscorer. She is fascinating to watch. The goals defy appearance. Miedema has a nonchalance that almost makes her look uninterested or lazy. It is a theme perpetuated by a dry wit and somewhat lackadaisical attitude to training and life in general. A photo of Miedema sitting on the floor, sunglasses on, in front of a group of Netherlands players powering away on exercise bikes drew amusement during the World Cup. Interviewers are often left bemused by her darkly honest sense of humour. Except she is anything but lazy. Miedema has a way of surveying the game as if settled in the eye of a storm, looking out waiting for a slip, a poor touch, a crack of space, that will prompt her to pounce into the fray. She may not bust a gut for 90 minutes but that is because she doesn\u2019t need to. It is intelligent play. Her four assists against Bristol City showed how she reads the runs of others because they are the runs she likes to make. She is a No 9 with the instincts, movement and foresight of a No 10. There were two crosses from the right, one from the left and, for the team\u2019s ninth goal, a wonderful chip from the forward who, spotting the darting run of Lisa Evans, lifted the ball over the defence and into her path. Last season, the pressure ramped up on the forward as Arsenal players dropped like flies, injuries weakening their squad. An exhausting end to the season was followed by a run to the World Cup final, two weeks\u2019 rest, then the launching of a title defence. This time there is a freedom to Miedema\u2019s play that comes from having a close-to-full-strength set of players around her. She is free to duck deeper and turn provider where perhaps she had to previously stay much tighter to the 18-yard box. \u201cYeah, well, to be fair, I do need a bit of pressure because otherwise I tend to get a bit lazy,\u201d she told the Guardian at the start of the season when asked whether the pressure on her had been lifted a little by players returning from injury. Except the lack of pressure does not seem to be doing her much harm. It is hard to find a more complete individual performance, even looking at those from players such as Kelly Smith or Julie Fleeting in their prime, yet she does not feel she is at her free-flowing best. \u201cI do feel a little closer [to full fitness],\u201d she told the Arsenal website on Sunday. \u201cBut also I\u2019m looking forward to the Christmas holidays.\u201d That is what is terrifying and exhilarating. The stalking forward is already special to watch; one of those players you know you are going to look back on and feel lucky to have seen live, yet she is still so young and so convinced there is more to come. Talking points \u2022 England\u2019s Beth Mead has signed a new \u201clong-term\u201d contract with Arsenal. The forward forced her way into Phil Neville\u2019s squad before the World Cup and has 25 caps. She joined Arsenal from Sunderland in 2017 and has scored 32 goals in 76 games, including four goals this season. \u2022 The eight-times FA Cup winners Southampton will play West Brom or Lincoln in the third round of this year\u2019s competition. Their rivals Southampton FC, who are affiliated to the men\u2019s club, will play Cardiff for as they push for a place in the fourth round, when WSL and Championship clubs join. The former WSL club Sunderland or their neighbours Middlesbrough play Fylde.

Rapinoe adds the award to the Fifa Best player of the year award she picked up in September, following her six goals that helped the USWNT to the World Cup and her to the Golden Boot and Golden Ball. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.
