He has just been announced as the latest director of dance for the Venice Biennale. \u201cWhat an invite, right?\u201d he says with a laugh, speaking to me by phone from his retreat on the Kenyan island of Lamu. The dance strand of the arts festival may be less well known than its art and architecture elements \u2013 a fact McGregor hopes to change \u2013 but it\u2019s still a significant 10-day event, held annually (despite the title). McGregor will be in charge for four years, starting in 2021. It\u2019s surprising that McGregor, 50, has time for another job. The resident choreographer at the Royal Ballet also runs his own company and studio, and choreographs worldwide, currently working on a major production for Dutch National Opera). He has a sideline in movement direction for film (Harry Potter, The Legend of Tarzan), works with Trinity Laban conservatoire in London and Elmhurst Ballet School in Birmingham \u2013 and in Lamu, he\u2019s currently writing a book about physical intelligence. But McGregor is full of energy and revelling in the Venice brief. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank canvas,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can really invent what we want to do.\u201d And what he wants to do is \u201cwork in a way the Biennale hasn\u2019t before\u201d. McGregor wants to deliver an experience that\u2019s not Eurocentric. \u201cContemporary dance in the African continent has not been widely shared,\u201d he says, \u201cand a lot of South America as well.\u201d As an early adopter of new technologies in dance, it\u2019s likely virtual and augmented reality will feature, but at a time when many of us have digital fatigue, more than anything he calls the biennale \u201can amazing opportunity to do some high-touch experiences that we\u2019ve been deprived of\u201d. By which he means dancers in \u201cfull-body contact, people moving phenomenally through space, the joy of the physical body moving, unrestricted\u201d. McGregor spent two weeks in Venice at this year\u2019s dance biennale, curated by choreographer Marie Chouinard, which went ahead last month just before Italy closed its theatres. It was a relief, he says, to be back in a darkened auditorium. \u201cI\u2019ve missed sitting in a theatre next to somebody else, feeling the breathing of the audience, not knowing what\u2019s going to happen when the curtain goes up,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cWill the performers deliver? Will they connect with us emotionally? What will that live moment be? That\u2019s the extraordinary thing you don\u2019t get in a mediated environment on a small computer screen.\u201d It is not a sensation confined to theatregoing: anyone isolated from others will know the feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s a similar kind of bereavement in terms of physical relations,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cThe classic idea that you don\u2019t think about your body until something goes wrong with it. This absence of physical relationships has been so marked. The way you communicate when you sense someone next to you, beyond their words, you can\u2019t really get on Zoom. You don\u2019t get the energy transfer that you do from a normal conversation.\u201d Although it has to be said, with McGregor you do get a dose of his enthusiastic, restlessly inquiring energy even over the phone. The effects of lockdown may bring a new physical awareness. \u201cWe\u2019ll all hopefully have improved our physical intelligence through this experience,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cWe should have a better spatial sense, certainly, from understanding what that one or two-metre rule is.\u201d And then there\u2019s communicating through barriers, like masks. \u201cI\u2019ve found myself trying to think of other physical ways I can give the sense of what my face would normally do, so I find myself really overanimated in the body, trying to transcend the mask.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s gesticulating down the phone. Even lockdown couldn\u2019t make McGregor stand still. As some projects stalled, new ones emerged, but the financial stability of his company was the prime concern. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s horrendous,\u201d he says. The company earns 70% of its money from international touring, which all stopped overnight. He\u2019s hoping to be back touring by next summer, and he\u2019s planning the biennale for July 2021 \u201cas if it\u2019s going to go ahead all bells and whistles\u201d. But until then there\u2019s the need to keep the industry alive, especially freelancers who haven\u2019t been eligible for grants. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is a lot of artists who\u2019ve got literally no money and are looking for any kind of job now to survive. We don\u2019t want that creative asset to be lost.\u201d McGregor\u2019s company has run training and mentoring for freelance dancers, all Covid-safe: it even has a special antimicrobial dance floor that kills viruses. Ever the optimist, McGregor can somehow find positives in a pandemic. \u201cOne of the brilliant things about this whole time is that the freelance community has got together to speak with a more communal voice, which might help us find a fresher future for freelancing. The important message is that the lobbying has to carry on. The \u00a31.5bn for the arts is brilliant and we\u2019re very grateful for it, but there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
