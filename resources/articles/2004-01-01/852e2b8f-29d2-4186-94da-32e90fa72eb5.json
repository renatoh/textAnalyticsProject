He has shaken hands with eager well-wishers as though he were challenging Howard Dean for the presidential nomination rather than just backing out of the sporting limelight. Are we all set to get on, then? New Year, new page, all that. Not exactly, mate. The lap of honour marked Steve Waugh's last Test match in Melbourne. It was merely penultimate. The real Waugh show starts tomorrow at his home ground in Sydney, where he will play his 168th and last Test match. All 35,000-odd tickets for each of the first three days have been sold and almost all those for the fourth, which is thought to be unprecedented. It will be Twelfth Night before we are done with this extended rendition of Auld Lang Syne. As a subsidiary entertainment for these multitudes the retiring captain of Australia will take part in a cricket match with 10 other Australians against 11 representatives of India. On all the evidence so far that should be quite something too. Australia and India play for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, held by India after they left the Australians for dead at home three years ago. There are people here who relish saying that this is the real prize in Test cricket, between the game's on-field and off-field powerhouses. They particularly relish saying it in front of Poms, because the undisguised subtext is that England no longer matter. And this has certainly been a more vivid set of contests than any Ashes series in the past two decades, including the last two that England won. But neither the contest nor the uncatchily named trophy have caught the Australian imagination before now because these Tests have rarely been closely fought. Australia have not won a series in India for 33 years, the one scratch on the glistening rapier of their recent achievements. India have never won a series in Australia and, before this one started, had lost seven consecutive Tests in Australia. England, by comparison, have been tigerish opponents. That has changed. India had the advantage in Brisbane and won in Adelaide before going down in Melbourne. The near-universal assumption here is that, now the Australians have the momentum, India will do the decent thing and not rain too hard on Waugh's parade. But sometimes people assume too much in these parts. The devastating batting form of both the next captain, Ricky Ponting, and Matthew Hayden has disguised several other features about this series that could be more worrying to the Australians. They may be insignificant cracks that Ponting might be able to repair quickly once he takes over and everyone can concentrate on the cricket again. They also might just be more significant. Australian dominance of world cricket was only authenticated nine years ago when, after the retirement of Viv Richards, they were able to go to the West Indies and win. Since then, though the captaincy has passed from Allan Border to Mark Taylor to Waugh and next to Ponting, the transitions have been seamless and their command overwhelming. In this series one side has been on top throughout - but it has not been either Australia or India. It has been bat over ball, and all without a significant contribution from the two most prolific batsmen on either side, Waugh and Sachin Tendulkar. The bowlers have been reduced to the role of helots familiar to them from one-day cricket, and rather sickly slaves at that. India go into this game without either the paceman Zaheer Khan or the slow left-armer Harbhajan Singh, arguably their two best bowlers. Australia find themselves in a strangely English situation. The only bowler certain of his place for Sydney 48 hours in advance was Stuart MacGill, who is only a stand-in for the banned Shane Warne anyway. Otherwise they have to perm three from Jason Gillespie, who will presumably play if fit, Brett Lee, who had a poor game in Melbourne, the staunch but ageing Andy Bichel and the inexperienced pair of Brad Williams and Nathan Bracken. So does Waugh's retirement mean the end of something more than one career? The only certainty is that, after all the fuss, he will never dare think of a comeback. Giant though he is, it remains mysterious that he has been granted a farewell tour the like of which cricket has never seen before. It has been partly circumstance. Had Waugh not announced his plan to go in advance, the pressure on him to give over at once in favour of Ponting would have been intolerable. And a variety of interests - the Australian Cricket Board, Waugh's own management, TV and the local Murdoch press to whom he is contracted - have all cottoned on to the fact that here is the ideal cricket marketing opportunity: nostalgia and a real live player to go with it. Murdoch's Sydney Daily Telegraph has been flogging red rags, replicas of Waugh's comfort object that he insists on carrying when he bats. We could hardly have done the same for Mike Atherton, since the only thing we know he ever carried in his pocket was a patch of Lord's dirt. In any case Atherton refused to tell anyone he was retiring, for fear someone might make a fuss. That is a more typical cricketing farewell than this one. Ian Botham finished embarrassingly, in front of a small gathering at Durham. There were no fanfares for Gavaskar or Kapil Dev or Richards. Border announced his retirement to a TV correspondent-mate in the middle of a round of golf. Worse, the bloke worked for the wrong TV company, much to official annoyance. This time, though, we are ringing out the old in style and taking five more days to do it: the longest-lasting Hogmanay bash of all time, even by Sydney's rip-roaring standards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
