The youths, aged 15, 16 and 19, were detained after the boy was discovered unconscious yesterday morning when police were called to the Golden Sands caravan park in Lancing, West Sussex. Paramedics declared him dead at the scene. He had earlier been seen drinking with a group of youths in a mobile chalet at the seaside resort. The three, who have been arrested on suspicion of murder, were last night being questioned by detectives. Det Supt Adam Hibbert of Sussex police, who is leading the inquiry, asked anyone who had been with the group to get in touch.\"It is possible some of the young people there may not be aware of what has happened and have not spoken to detectives.\" The attack occurred just a day after a 15-year-old boy was charged with murdering Martin Dinnegan, 14, who was stabbed to death in a north London street. A 16-year-old youth and a 20-year-old man were yesterday also charged with his murder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
