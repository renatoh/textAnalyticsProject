Just let me finish and then I'll be with you. Thanks. So, good chats last week, heated discussions on matters more commonly debated on Comment is Free, recipes exchanged and widespread denunciation of the rowdier works of Queen. All good. I hope this week's topic won't dampen spirits (geddit?!) too much. Before we discuss that, the small matter of the B-list. Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Racing In the Street There have been victories, burning off opponents in his 69 Chevy. He references Martha and the Vandelas. But there seems to be little joy in his triumph, especially when his baby's crying through fear. Chas'n'Dave \u2013 The Victory Song Loved May1366's justification, more so than the song itself. But sports songs are songs too. And consider this the Chas'n'Dave memorial B-listing while we're at it. Lord Beginner \u2013 Victory Test Match A different sporting song from a different era and, of course, a different part of the world. Some of the lyrics are pieces of TMS-esque commentary: \"West Indies first innings total/was 320 for 6 as usual.\" The grainy version I listened to made it sound like it was transmitting live from the past. Terry Callier \u2013 Love Theme from Spartacus Such a beautiful piece of music. \"Almost close, almost here,\" what a voice. Liked the justification but I couldn't get the image of Kirk Douglas on a cross out of my head and so couldn't really associate it with victory. B-list it is then. R Kelly \u2013 The World's Greatest I don't like the backing music (strictly anodyne R&amp;B), but let's face it, this song isn't about the music. It's not even much about his voice either. It's all about the bombast and, boy, does he deliver that. Laurie Anderson \u2013 O Superman Didn't know much about Anderson and certainly surprised to find this was a chart hit. Disorienting and eerie, I'm reading it as a dark hymn to the west's cold-war power (a victory of sorts?) Everyone's a Winner \u2013 Hot Chocolate And they certainly are when this number is up. Great hook and, like the Meters' I Just Kissed My Baby, it's about the feeling of victory that love can bring. Elbow \u2013 Coming Second This is one for all the RR miserablists. A fabulously gritty number that's really about failure, but does at least dish out the gong for \"best dishevelled lover three years running\". Marvelletes \u2013 Hunter Gets Captured by the Game This has an odd, melancholy mood (you can see why Massive Attack covered it). Ice Cube \u2013 Today Was a Good Day When life's little victories consist of not getting shot by an AK47. Underpinned by a great, lazy Isley Brothers sample. So songs about the rain then. The content needn't be exclusively meteorological, but precipitation should feature prominently and, preferably, influence the direction or mood of the song. As ever, much will lie in the justification. The rulebook: please do not publish more than a third of the lyrics of any one song. The deadline for submissions is midday Monday.
