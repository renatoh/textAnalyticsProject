Both Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, will give speeches on Thursday in the north-west of England as the campaign gathers pace. McDonnell will announce a \u00a3150bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to be spent over the next five years to \u201crepair the social fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d, and confirm plans to shift \u201ca powerful section of the Treasury\u201d to the north. In 2017, the Conservatives\u2019 claims that Labour was relying on a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d to fund its lavish spending pledges fell flat when Theresa May\u2019s party failed to publish costings of its own policies. But Javid will signal the Tories\u2019 determination to attack Labour on the economy relentlessly over the next five weeks \u2013 although unlike two years ago, the government is touting a series of multibillion pound spending pledges of its own. He will also have to manage without the Treasury\u2019s costings of Labour\u2019s policy pledges, which he was blocked from publishing on Wednesday by the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill. \u201cWe won\u2019t let Labour off the hook like last time. Look to the lessons of history: they\u2019ll ruin our finances, raise your taxes and saddle the next generation with debt,\u201d Javid will say. \u201cEvery single Labour government has left our country\u2019s economy in a mess.\u201d The chancellor will also accuse McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn of being the \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d of economic policy \u2013 comparing them to parents who refuse to have their children inoculated against illnesses. \u201cNot only did they reject the treatment needed to heal our economy and get the deficit down by four-fifths, they now want to take every step imaginable to make the country sick and unhealthy again,\u201d he will say. But McDonnell will insist his social transformation fund, alongside a \u00a3250bn green transformation fund, to be spent over the next decade, is necessary to put the UK back on its feet, and prepare for the climate crisis. \u201cSpent over the first five years of our Labour government, the social transformation fund will begin the urgent task of repairing our social fabric that the Tories have torn apart. A hundred and fifty billion pounds to replace, upgrade and expand our schools, hospitals, care homes and council houses. To deal with the human emergency which the Tories have created, alongside the climate emergency,\u201d he will say. Labour has not yet spelled out how it will pay for its policy pledges, though it has insisted they will be fully funded \u2013 and that it will publish a separate costings document, as it did in 2017. Labour\u2019s approach to the wealthy has already featured heavily in the early days of the campaign. In an election rally in Telford, Shropshire, on Wednesday, eight miles from where he grew up, Corbyn said a Labour majority government would \u201cchase down\u201d those who attempt a \u201cclever wheeze\u201d with their tax. His comments come after Boris Johnson said in the Telegraph that Corbyn would slap new taxes on people of all income levels \u2013 not just billionaires \u2013 and that the party \u201cviscerally detests\u201d those who have a profit motive. Corbyn said: \u201cMy personal views on billionaires is that they\u2019ve obviously got a great deal of money therefore they are in a very strong position to pay a lot more tax. \u201cSo our tax plans will affect the richest 5% of our society. We will be chasing down tax evasion, tax avoidance and tax havens because at the end of the day if you\u2019re doing some very clever wheeze, which somehow or other is avoiding your levels of taxation, you should be paying. Go further away [and] what happens then? You\u2019ve got an underfunded school, hospital and public services as a whole.\u201d Corbyn and McDonnell will unveil Labour\u2019s election bus at Liverpool Docks on Thursday. Emblazoned with the slogan, \u201cIt\u2019s Time for Real Change\u201d, it will tour marginal constituencies across the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
