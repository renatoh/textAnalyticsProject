Ministers are to overhaul laws that mean parents can avoid supporting their child by holding their money in a joint account with a new partner. Current rules mean only money held in a sole account can be seized for payment. Under new rules that will come into force early next year, the Department for Work and Pensions will ensure that money held in a joint account can also be liable for maintenance payments. Ministers believe that closing this loophole could lead to more than \u00a3390,000 of additional child maintenance being collected. Safeguards will be put in place to ensure that only funds belonging to the paying parent will be targeted. Joint accounts will be used only when the parent in question does not have their own account, or their account does not have enough to cover what they owe. Gosport MP Caroline Dinenage, the minister for child maintenance, said: \u201cOur priority is for children to get the support they need. \u201cOnly a small minority of parents try to cheat their way out of paying towards their children\u2026 and this new power will be another tool to tackle those who do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
