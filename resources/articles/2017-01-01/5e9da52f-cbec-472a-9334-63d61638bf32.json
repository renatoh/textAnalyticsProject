Liverpool had become utterly exasperated by the confusion surrounding his eligibility during the Africa Cup of Nations after Cameroon announced they wanted the 25-year-old to play in Gabon. Matip had made his position clear in the lead-up to the tournament that he had retired from international duty but, without any clarity or direction from Fifa over the player, Liverpool were left fearing punishment from the game\u2019s governing body. The Liverpool manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, had said: \u201cOur understanding is Jo\u00ebl is retired from international football and we, the club, did everything we had to do to make this clear but until now we could not get the response we need to be 100% sure that he can play. It\u2019s pretty difficult and pretty frustrating, to be honest. He\u2019s been in training for five days and would have been in the squad, 100%, maybe on the pitch today, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. But we cannot do more and are still waiting on the decision. We could not take the risk.\u201d Finally, on Friday evening, the club received information from Fifa declaring that they were free to play Matip. A club statement read: \u201cLiverpool FC can confirm that all charges against the club and its player Jo\u00ebl Matip have been dismissed by Fifa following confirmation this evening from world football\u2019s governing body. \u201cThe club had requested Fifa to provide guidance on Matip\u2019s eligibility after a complaint had been made by Fecafoot [the Cameroon FA] to Fifa concerning the player\u2019s purported call-up to the Cameroon national team for the Africa Cup of Nations. \u201cFollowing Fifa\u2019s ruling, the club now considers the player available for selection.\u201d Matip was withdrawn from Liverpool\u2019s squad against Manchester United and also missed the subsequent FA Cup tie at Plymouth Argyle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
