Still, eyebrows were inevitably raised at the stark \u2013 and widely audible \u2013 rebuke issued by Jordan Spieth to his caddie, Michael Greller, during the opening round of the US Open. Spieth, who is continuing a climb back towards the summit of the game after months in the doldrums, found the Pacific Ocean with a four-iron tee shot at the eighth hole. The ball had bounced, bounced and bounced before disappearing over a cliff. The Texan\u2019s mood hardly improved with the result of his third shot, which airmailed the green. \u201cTwo perfect shots, Michael,\u201d said Spieth to Greller. \u201cYou got me in the water on one and over the green on the other.\u201d Oops. Later Spieth naturally tried to play down the affair. \u201cWhen you hit a couple of shots exactly where you want to, and one\u2019s in the water and the other\u2019s dead over the green, I\u2019m gonna be frustrated that, as a team, we didn\u2019t figure out how to make sure that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he explained. \u201cI may have looked like the bad guy there but my intentions there were that we should have been in play if the ball is hit solidly and I was out of play on both shots.\u201d Spieth appears slightly disingenuous with his outlook. There was no \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cteam\u201d at the time; he was pinning the blame firmly on Greller. It would be a mistake to regard this as an exceptional circumstance but Spieth\u2019s reputation does not lend itself to such episodes. For the best players in the world, rightly or wrongly, part of the highly paid bagman\u2019s job is to act as a punchbag when things go wrong. What Spieth said was not offensive but the social media reaction to his outburst was almost entirely negative. \u201cWho hits the shot?\u201d was the general, and legitimate, theme. At any given tournament, listen closely enough and you will detect language and abuse fired at caddies that is not for the fainthearted. By and large \u2013 there is the odd exception \u2013 they take it. This goes with the territory, as does 10% of the huge purse when the going is good. Footballers rant at referees, golfers do likewise to their caddies. Even the most personable players have been guilty of some horrendous slights \u2013 personal and professional \u2013 towards their hired hand after a miscued iron or misread putt. The player-caddie relationship has returned to sharp focus this week after Steve Williams stepped from semi-retirement to work for Jason Day. JP Fitzgerald, who enjoyed great success with Rory McIlroy, is tipped to return to the Tour with the hot American prospect Matthew Wolff. \u201cHe came back on the bag to win major championships,\u201d Day said of Williams. \u201cHopefully I can fulfil that dream for both of us.\u201d In looking to redress what he regards as underachievement in his career, Day has turned to the man made famous by Tiger Woods \u2013 it was not, contrary to occasional Williams perception, the reverse \u2013 with the feeling of respect clearly mutual. \u201cWhen I retired from caddying, I told my wife that there\u2019s only three players I\u2019d consider working for and Jason is one of them,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s not at his peak yet. It was an opportunity I relished.\u201d The \u201cthree players\u201d remark suggests the Williams ego has not softened over time. Day\u2019s relationships with caddies has been fascinating in itself. His long-term coach, and father figure, Colin Swatton was on bag duties for the hitherto most successful spell of the Australian\u2019s professional career. Feeling Swatton would be better served observing from afar, Day turned to friends in rotation as caddies; a scene he obviously felt was not nearly profitable enough. After discussion with his wife, agent and Swatton, Day believed Williams was the man to instil the on-course element of a work ethic he believes has not been at required standard in recent times. \u201cI told Steve: \u2018Look, My goal is to get back to No 1 in the world,\u201d Day said. \u201cI want to do everything I possibly can to get there. If I need to do whatever you need to tell me, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 \u201cI know that his drive and his will to be successful is very, very high. I think he\u2019s kind of a no-bullshit kind of guy. He\u2019ll tell you straight. He told me: \u2018If you\u2019re not working hard enough, I\u2019m gone.\u2019 So that\u2019s pretty much a good enough incentive to go out and bust your butt.\u201d To his credit, Day has no form for publicly castigating anybody and certainly not a caddie. Should he try it with Williams \u2013 a pitbull type when Woods was at the peak of his powers \u2013 it would be quite the spectacle. Spieth versus Greller would represent a plasticine party in comparison."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
