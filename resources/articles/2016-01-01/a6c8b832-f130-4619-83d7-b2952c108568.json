According to Theo Walcott, it is all that Mesut \u00d6zil needs. Once the Arsenal playmaker has locked on, the creative sparks fly. It is the speed of \u00d6zil\u2019s execution that has taken the breath away. \u201cYou think: \u2018Give the ball now,\u2019\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has said. \u201cYou have not finished your thinking and the ball has gone already.\u201d Arsenal are riding high at the turn of the Premier League season and Walcott believes that in his 10 years at the club, this is the best team he has played for. It is \u00d6zil who has ignited the possibilities. In April 2014, towards the end of \u00d6zil\u2019s first season at Arsenal \u2013 which had been marked by highs and lows \u2013 Wenger predicted the German would be a contender for the player of the year awards in 2014\u201115. It is worth remembering the line the manager used to support his argument. \u201cThe improvement will be in goals, assists and his presence in the game,\u201d he said. It was only Wenger\u2019s timing that was out. \u201cWithout a doubt, Mesut has been the player of this season so far,\u201d Walcott said. \u201cThe stats show that but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s his work rate through the games. He is only going to get better and better. You don\u2019t have many left-footers and they make that movement from out to in, they make the bend of the ball. You just have to make eye contact with Mesut and, once you get that, he knows where you\u2019re going to go.\u201d \u00d6zil has 16 assists in the Premier League and three goals; he has two more goals in the Champions League. On Monday, he took Bournemouth apart in the 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium, setting up the first for Gabriel and scoring the second himself. \u00d6zil laid on a total of nine chances, the majority of them for Walcott. \u201cMesut has told me to keep making runs,\u201d Walcott said. \u201cHe just spots it. I need to help him out by putting the ball in the net. Mesut is just a special player and he is in the form of his life. Some of the things you see on the pitch \u2026 his goal against Bournemouth alone. He didn\u2019t break stride, it was like he was jogging. He just slows things down when he is playing.\u201d Newcastle United visit the Emirates on Saturday and could be forgiven for feeling afraid. For Arsenal, the fear is that \u00d6zil will break down. Wenger gave him a week off during the last international break and he said that, of late, \u00d6zil \u201cdoesn\u2019t practise a lot, we rest him a lot between games.\u201d Red zones have become the buzz phrase around Arsenal\u2019s finely-tuned stars and, when available, Wenger always plays \u00d6zil. He dare not leave him out, particularly while Santi Cazorla and Jack Wilshere are injured. \u201cYou look, as well, at the impact \u00d6zil can have on other players,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThe Premier League is very tight and if you go into a decisive game and you do that [rest \u00d6zil], the other players think subconsciously: \u2018Why?\u2019 They don\u2019t tell you but they think: \u2018Why?\u2019 Even the player himself does.\u201d Wenger advanced one of those theories of his that is designed to soothe anxiety but does not always bear scrutiny. \u201c\u00d6zil is a guy who, once the basic fitness is there between the games, he wants to play,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThere are types of players and sometimes the most technical players \u2026 it looks like it demands less energy for them to play. It is just natural for them.\u201d \u00d6zil made a slow start to last season after his World Cup triumph with Germany and he was ruled out for three months from early October with a knee problem. But when he came back, he eased into fine form and Arsenal finished the season strongly. \u00d6zil has not looked back since. His relationships with team-mates such as Walcott are now established and there is the hope that the club can once again enjoy a powerful second half to the season, boosted by the return of injured players. If they do, a first title in 12 years could be their reward. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to look ahead of ourselves but we have a history of ending the season well,\u201d Walcott said. \u201cWe are getting players back fit and we have one of the best squads when we have everyone fit. I truly believe that. It\u2019s the best team I\u2019ve been involved in and when you have Mesut and the way he is playing, it gets the best out of everyone. \u201cPlayers came in against Bournemouth who hadn\u2019t been playing too much and they did fantastically well and that just shows the strength in depth we have in this team, and the pressure on places. We have the confidence and it\u2019s just flowing out there.\u201d Walcott also talked about Arsenal\u2019s last-16 Champions League draw with Barcelona \u2013 the team who eliminated them in 2010 and 2011, and beat them in the 2006 final. \u201cI\u2019d actually totally forgotten when it was the draw,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a group message and the guys were saying: \u2018You won\u2019t believe who we\u2019ve got.\u2019 Obviously Barcelona\u2019s three up front are their main threat and it will be a tough draw but we have good qualities in this team and we can do some damage. \u201cIt will be special and when we play them away [in the second leg], it is my birthday so, hopefully, it\u2019ll be a good moment for me and the team. If you want to reach the best in the game, you\u2019ve got to play the best.\u201d Walcott believes that with \u00d6zil, he is alongside the best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
