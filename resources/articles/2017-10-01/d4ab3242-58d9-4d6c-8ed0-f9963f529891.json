Crossover stars such as Anthony Joshua, who last night defended his world heavyweight titles, are broadening the sport\u2019s appeal beyond traditional audiences, sending interest soaring. Joshua\u2019s fight against Carlos Takam at Cardiff\u2019s Principality Stadium took place in front of the largest ever crowd for an indoor bout. Yet outside the ring, shadows have been cast by a spate of violent episodes among spectators, including what police describe as \u201clarge-scale disorder\u201d outside one event this month, when a young man was stabbed to death. On the eve of Joshua\u2019s fight, 250 miles to the north, the first bell had just sounded for a rather different evening at Hull City Hall. Billed as the \u201cCity Hall Brawl\u201d in promotional material decorated with blood-spattered wording, this is boxing without the primetime glamour, even if the passions of the audience are not in doubt. Despite the gory imagery, it also turned out to be an efficiently run, peaceful evening enjoyed by several hundred mainly male spectators, along with a few dozen women and young boys. \u201cA police presence is needed,\u201d said promoter Kalle Sauerland, who warned that brawling among crowds was an emerging trend. In some cases, he said, football hooligan \u201cfirms\u201d were clashing at boxing fixtures not subject to the security measures that have largely ended conflicts at football matches. \u201cBoxing is certainly now a national sport and its popularity is gaining, thanks to people like Anthony Joshua and the Olympic gold medallists. You see the demand for it on television. It\u2019s a big national sport. We need to provide a safe space.\u201d Others who admit that violence is a problem cite alcohol consumption and the prevalence of cocaine, a drug consistently linked to violent behaviour. Also looming large is the threatening and often graphically violent language some fighters use to ratchet up tensions that then find a 24-hour echo chamber on social media. \u201cIt is hugely disappointing when people say things they shouldn\u2019t say,\u201d said Robert Smith, general secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control, who pointed to recent fines for comments and behaviour, including a \u00a325,000 penalty for David Haye and \u00a330,000 for Dereck Chisora. \u201cI think there is a responsibility on the media as well. I think sometimes that these people \u2013 men and women \u2013 are put in positions they should not be in. We all have a responsibility but, ultimately, they are the ones who say these things and we do fine them and discipline people.\u201d In the case of Chisora \u2013 fined for hurling a table at Dillian Whyte at a press conference for their bout last December \u2013 the fight was still allowed to go ahead on the same bill as Joshua and Eric Molin. When Whyte won on a split decision, it was the cue for a brawl at the Manchester Arena as groups of men pummelled each other to the sound of Sweet Caroline on the PA system. Incidents since have included a mass brawl on 8 July at the Copper Box Arena in east London when Sam McNess, a West Ham fan with a large local following, was beaten by Asinia Byfield. By some accounts, the brawling started when Byfield appeared to goad the McNess fans by making an \u201cIrons\u201d gesture \u2013 a reference to one of West Ham\u2019s traditional nicknames. On video, an announcer can be heard appealing for those involved to sit down, adding: \u201cGentlemen, this is boxing, not football.\u201d More serious violence in the crowd erupted less than two months later at the same venue, where the owners say that procedures have been reviewed. Last month was particularly violent, with fighting in Stuttgart on 8 October between British and German fans at Chris Eubank Jr\u2019s bout with Avni Yildirim, followed by violence six days later at Wembley Arena during George Groves\u2019s knockout win over Jamie Cox. On the same night, 19-year-old Reagan Asbury was fatally stabbed in the neck after fighting among spectators at a bout between Luke Paddock and Myron Mills at Walsall town hall. Inside Hull City Hall on Friday night, however, there was bemusement that anyone would want to upstage the combatants inside the ring. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something that would happen here,\u201d said Lee Walgate as he watched the fighting with a plastic pint glass in hand through the doorway from the bar area, where notices informed patrons that alcohol could not be brought to the seating area around the ring. Women in Hull city council sweatshirts occasionally swooped to retrieve a glass from an errant spectator wandering in. \u201cMaybe if some lads came over from Leeds, though \u2026\u201d joked his friend Gareth Fernie, who spoke passionately about the growth in boxing\u2019s popularity in the city \u2013 helped by the Olympic gold medallist Luke Campbell \u2013 and its chances of becoming Britain\u2019s number two sport. Both men agreed that the bloody City Hall Brawl promotional material might not have been wise \u2013 \u201cit also just seems a bit amateurish\u201d \u2013 but any onlooker would have been hard pressed to view this as a disorderly crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly family and friends here tonight, or people who genuinely enjoy boxing itself as part of the local scene,\u201d said Jamie Waltham, owner of the O\u2019Rileys venue where boxing regularly attracts crowds of several hundred. Elsewhere, however, violence has been making a \u201ctransition\u201d from football events to boxing for some time, according to close observers such as Craig Scott, editor of the Fight Talk website, who said the problem was only now being noticed by the media. \u201cBoxers are now being aligned to local football teams in order to broaden their support. I would question whether this actually helps the venue, promoter or broadcaster, or whether it\u2019s seen as a quick fix when shifting tickets,\u201d said Scott, who spoke of watching groups of up to 40 men at a time erupt into violence last month at the Wembley Arena. He believes alcohol may play a part but said regulating it would be tricky and audiences now expected drink to be available. As for other substances, he added: \u201cAnyone who has been in attendance at a boxing event recently will tell you cocaine is everywhere.\u201d Authority figures from the British Boxing Board of Control such as Robert Smith admit that cocaine use among some of those attending events has become a concern. \u201cUnfortunately in today\u2019s society, this is not just a boxing issue. It\u2019s a societal one, and unfortunately it\u2019s not just alcohol any more,\u201d he said. But he added that the problem of violence should be viewed in context. Some 250 events took place last year and 260 will have taken place by the end of this year. The percentage of contests that involved trouble was small. That said, while he believed that policing was not always the answer, concerns about terrorism are already stretching security at major events. If promoters wanted an increased police presence then they could always pay for it out of their own pocket, Smith said. In Hull, one of the biggest cheers of the night came for the victory of Evaldas Korsakas, a Lithuanian adopted by the Hull boxing faithful as one of their own in a city that voted heavily for Brexit last year. \u201cThere might be poverty here but the divisions are just not as great as in the south,\u201d said Danny Shenton, a local musician and part-time boxer, as around him there was loud cheering from local fans and a group of men waving a Lithuanian flag. Boxing, Shenton added, helped to break down what barriers there might be. \u201cYou can see how popular Evaldas is \u2013 we have big hopes for him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
