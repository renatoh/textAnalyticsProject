We are an adult society. For a long time now Spain and Catalonia haven\u2019t had a common project. It\u2019s like a marriage where you only stay together because of the mortgage. Spain doesn\u2019t invest in Catalonia, and a lot of the money wasted on high-speed trains that go from nowhere to nowhere, or on corruption, comes from here. I hope that we can all, whether Yes or No, get to vote, then we\u2019ll see what happens. MARTA CASADO FELIU, 19 Studying to be an interpreter Barcelona Although it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ll be able to vote I have my doubts about doing so. The majority of Catalans want a referendum, but this one is illegal. Furthermore, although the secessionists have a majority in parliament they represent only 47.8% of the popular vote and they appear to be acting alone on behalf of less than half the population. I don\u2019t see how this referendum can serve as the base for a unilateral declaration of independence and doubt it would get international recognition. Both the Catalan and Spanish governments use the issue to distract attention from corruption and cuts in health and education. I hope one day we can vote in a proper referendum. MART\u00ed PONT ROJAS, 19 Science student Barcelona I will vote because I think Spain needs a wake-up call. If they keep treating us the way they do, attacking people, our language and our culture, Catalonia and Spain will never be united. I will vote Yes even though with Podemos it\u2019s possible to believe in a less conservative Spain. But first the old guard has to go before young people can believe the system is capable of bringing about change. Depending on the result, I think this referendum is a basis for declaring independence. If No wins, we\u2019ll shut up, but if it\u2019s Yes, the conflict will continue. MERC\u00e8 VILARRUBIAS, 53 English teacher Barcelona I won\u2019t be voting. I think that right now the priority has to be to re-establish the law. The Catalan government has passed two laws that supplant the Spanish constitution and the statutes that give Catalonia its autonomy. I think this situation with two opposing sets of laws is very dangerous, and that the state needs to take control, otherwise the Catalan government will choose the laws it likes. But the government has managed the crisis very badly, refusing to talk and acting with great disdain towards the Catalans, but I would support it in trying to re-establish the rule of law. After that, I hope we can find politicians who are up to the job. SERGI MONFORT CLARAMUNT, 23 Forestry management student El Vendrell I will vote Yes, even though the referendum lacks certain guarantees, because I believe it\u2019s a democratic right and that Catalonia needs a change for the better. For that to happen we need to become independent. Spain and the international community need to listen to the Catalans\u2019 voice and opinions and accept their decisions. I don\u2019t think that at an international level they will have any choice other than to accept the result. Things here are going to change after 1 October. We will begin a process of separation and the establishment of a new state."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
