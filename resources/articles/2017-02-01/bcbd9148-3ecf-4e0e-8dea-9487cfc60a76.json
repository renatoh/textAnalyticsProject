The highly unconventional intervention comes before this week\u2019s synod, which will be dominated by rancorous divisions over sexuality. Officials hope the 500-plus members of the church\u2019s general assembly will approve a recent report from bishops which upholds the traditional teaching that marriage is a lifelong union between one man and one woman. But a rebellion is being orchestrated by supporters of LGBT rights who are dismayed at the bishops\u2019 restatement of doctrine. The church insists that gay clergy must be celibate, and clergy are forbidden from conducting same-sex marriage services. An open letter from 14 retired bishops, led by Peter Selby, the former bishop of Worcester, and including Richard Harries, former bishop of Oxford, urges their successors to think again. They say serving bishops have sought to manage a conflict \u201crather than perhaps enabling or leading\u201d. The letter rebukes the former bishops\u2019 successors for marginalising the views of LGBT members of the church. \u201cOur perception is that, while the pain of LGBT people is spoken about in your report, we do not hear its authentic voice,\u201d it says. The letter \u2013 sent to all serving bishops this weekend \u2013 acknowledges that an immediate change in church law to allow same-sex marriage would be unrealistic, given the depths of division on the issue. But, it adds, \u201cyour call for change of tone and culture, while absolutely right, does not carry conviction\u201d. It also criticises the bishops for not allowing \u201cthe theological voice of some of us to be heard properly\u201d \u2013 a reference to those who argue for an inclusive interpretation of scripture. The retired bishops\u2019 intervention was very unusual, Selby told the Observer. \u201cThere will be some [serving bishops] who think \u2018why don\u2019t these dinosaurs shut up, it\u2019s none of their business\u2019. But I hope there will also be some who are glad we have put this on the record.\u201d Since \u201cshared conversations\u201d on sexuality ended last July, the House of Bishops has met four times to discuss the next steps. In a bid to avoid a split, the synod will not be asked to accept its report but merely \u201ctake note\u201d of it. This procedure is usually a formality, but campaigners are fomenting a challenge. They plan to demand separate votes on the \u201ctake note\u201d motion in each section of the synod: bishops, clergy and laity. A rejection by one section \u2013 most likely the clergy \u2013 would mean the motion would be lost, in what would be an extraordinary rebuff to the bishops. Campaigners have ready an alternative motion demanding that a \u201cset of forward-looking proposals on same-sex relationships\u201d be tabled next year. If there were \u201ca strong negative current\u201d against the report, the bishops would be forced to think again, said Selby. Although the bishops said their report represented a consensus rather than a unanimous view, Selby said it was \u201cregrettable that what\u2019s come out is a kind of compromised document, with no indication that there was a struggle and there are alternative views I know there is very, very strong pressure to limit the damage that a conflict can cause.\u201d He added: \u201cWe felt we needed to say something, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve no doubt I\u2019ll get some flak, both from people who disagree and from people who think I shouldn\u2019t open my mouth.\u201d While upholding a traditional definition of marriage, the bishops\u2019 report said church law and guidance should be interpreted with \u201cmaximum freedom\u201d without indicating what might be permitted. Conservatives in the church have welcomed the restatement of traditional doctrine but some have warned the report could lead to \u201ctheological incoherence\u201d. The Church of England said: \u201cThe purpose of the shared conversations process was not to change the view of participants or to seek to change the views of others, but rather to recognise Jesus in the face, story and view of those with whom they might disagree. \u201cThere are no formal proposals being debated at general synod. The \u2018take note\u2019 debate will be an opportunity for those with differing opinions on this issue to have their views aired.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
