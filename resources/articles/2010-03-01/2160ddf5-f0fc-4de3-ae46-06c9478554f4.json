The Lancastrian, who is now 39, will take the first steps towards that goal at this week's world track championships in Copenhagen, where he is among five contenders for the four places in the Great Britain 4,000m team pursuit. Modestly, Queally claims that he is likely to be \"fifth man\", in essence the travelling reserve. But the Great Britain endurance coach, Dan Hunt, has said that all options remain open over who will race in Friday's event. \"At the moment there is no set team, there are five guys for four slots in the final selection for qualifying and then we will review it and replace someone if it's warranted,\" said Hunt. On 9 March, as the team tested over 3km on the Manchester velodrome at sub-four-minute pace, Queally did not look remotely out of place, which is exactly what is required in a discipline that relies on four men working perfectly as a unit. The rider who began Britain's current gold rush with his dramatic win in Sydney accepts that London is a far greater challenge, not least because the team pursuit squad are currently without two of their Beijing gold medallists, Geraint Thomas and Bradley Wiggins, who are focusing on the road in the colours of Team Sky. \"It's going to be hard,\" Queally said. \"I obviously thought it was never going to happen. I thought my career as an elite international cyclist was over. I'd achieved what I'd achieved, life was great, I was happy with what I was doing.\" Indeed, he had moved to the paralympic squad as a tandem pacer, after failing to make selection for Beijing, and his transfer back to the main team was confirmed only last week. Queally's change of direction is a key part of the British squad's drive to take the discipline to new levels of speed. Team GB set what appeared to be a definitive world record in Beijing with 3min 53.314sec, but a radically altered quartet registered 3:54 at the Manchester World Cup in November, implying that en route to London the record could go towards 3:50. \"To do that, we need riders who can get up to speed quicker and absorb the start effort,\" said Hunt. That is where Queally comes in, thanks to his background in the 1km time trial, where the rider has to get to more than 40mph within a lap of a standing start and hold that pace. \"It's tough, but my physiology lends itself to it,\" said the rider. \"I was never an out-and-out sprinter. I always had some aerobic capacity: as a kilo rider, the last lap was always my strong point.\" Hunt said: \"The team pursuit has always been an endurance event, but as it gets quicker and quicker it falls between the boundaries of sprint and endurance. It's like the mile or middle-distance running. It's not for pure sprinters or endurance athletes, but hybrid athletes who are very, very fast and have fantastic endurance. Having Jason is hugely exciting. He brings a lot to the party: power, durability, reliability. He's only a few months into it, so to make the worlds team was a big, big ask, but hopefully he will become a cornerstone of the programme.\" \"I will do my hardest to make it,\" said Queally, \"but if I don't, I will have done my damndest and will have contributed to whatever happens along the way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
