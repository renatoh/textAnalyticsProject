I regard him as our greatest living artist and greet his every pronouncement with a loud clap of my hands. The flatter the vowels, the better. So when, last week, he indulged in what for him was a fairly low-level rant about how he fears that we are entering a post-visual age, I was all set to agree. You're absolutely right, David, I thought. We do spend far too much time listening to our iPods and not enough gazing out of the window - and, yes, the result of this is that people are visually illiterate, unable either to draw or to dress themselves ('it produces a lot of badly dressed people,' he said, with a twang of his polka-dot braces). But I was just getting carried away, as usual. This time Hockney has slipped up. On the matter of drawing, he is spot on. I know enough about what goes on in art schools to be sure of that. But I'm not convinced that most people - or at least those who live in cities - are visually illiterate. It's more that they have learned to edit all the visual junk: the orange bollards; the men in fluorescent jackets digging pointless holes; the billboards; the heaps of freesheets; the plastic bags oozing stinking rubbish. The National Gallery's experimental Grand Tour illustrates this selective blindness perfectly. The Grand Tour is a new project in which 44 high quality photographic reproductions of some of the gallery's most famous paintings have been scattered throughout Soho and Covent Garden. The paintings are framed, and come with notes as they would in the gallery, but now they are out in the world, to be discovered by accident. When I read about this I thought: who, as they scurry from Pret a Manger to Ryman's, is honestly going to notice that over there, just by the door of Caffe Nero, is Diego Velazquez's portrait of Philip IV of Spain? But then I took a walk through town myself, and suddenly the whole thing made sense. The images, hunkered down in gloomy alleys, or loitering at the doors of cafes and sex shops, manage to make their presence felt in spite of the competition. A great painting is still a great painting, even when it's released from the pristine sanctity of a gallery - or perhaps especially when it is. Anyone who has ever visited a gallery is familiar with the exhausting syndrome of gallery vision, when you look and look but still don't see. But when you're out in the streets, a work like Joseph Wright's incredibly strange 'An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump' - a cockatoo is about to suffocate in a glass dome - shouts at you through the urban fuzz. It's in colour; everything else is in black and white. Wright's painting, which I love, is in Meard Street, in Soho, which smells of pee. Last week, as I passed by, I heard a guy in aviator sunglasses say under his breath no fewer than three times: 'What's this all about?' Exactly the right question. The Grand Tour is intended to remind us that these paintings can be seen free any day of the week just up the road (only 28 per cent of the National Gallery's visitors are Londoners; when the Gallery staged its recent Manet/Picasso show, many visitors were amazed to be told that all the paintings belonged to its permanent collection). But so startling is the effect - the reproductions really are good, the locations witty and surprising - that I think it works as an exhibition in its own right. It's also a perfect exercise, in branding terms, in simplicity. Two weeks on, and we are still worked up about the awful 2012 Olympics logo, the bill for which is \u00a3400,000. The National Gallery's extended advertisement cost it next to nothing. The reproductions were printed by Hewlett-Packard, one of its sponsors, and will be recycled when the whole thing is over (they will be sent to schools and hospitals). The owners of the 44 walls on which the images have been stuck all donated their sites. This bare bones value appeals to the ascetic in me, though the Grand Tour would be worth it even if the bill were rather bigger. It's so much more than an ad; it's a public service, and a treat. I just wish they would take it to other cities; the train companies could sponsor it in return for a mention of the price of an Apex ticket. So Hockney is wrong to worry that, outside of spaces devoted to art, people's eyes are no longer capable of giving them pleasure. We might be entirely oblivious of the identikit noodle bar that opened on the corner three months ago - and that can only be a good thing - but Stubbs's Whistlejacket, dancing on a wall in Seven Dials, is quite a different matter. Out in the streets, people are removing their little white headphones and stopping in their tracks. Blair's breathtaking legacy In 10 days' time the Pickfords vans will roll into Downing Street and Tony Blair will finally depart. Should you want to mark this special day, I suggest you buy not Alastair Campbell's forthcoming diaries but Adam Thorpe's new novel, Between Each Breath. It's a masterpiece. I have been waiting and waiting for a novel about Blair's Britain - for a book that does for him what Jonathan Coe's What a Carve Up! or Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty did for Mrs Thatcher - and now, with immaculate timing, here it is. Several reviewers have described Between Each Breath as a great book about male cowardice, which is exactly right. But it's also a novel that perfectly captures, without ever mentioning the words Tony Blair or New Labour, the sickly downer of early promise followed by failed expectations, and sets it faultlessly against the backdrop of an anxiety-inducing hum of bombs on trains, illegal immigration, urban poverty and global warming. But perhaps I have made it sound dreary and earnest. It isn't. It's also hilarious. I can't remember the last time Hampstead dinner parties were satirised to such delicious effect. review@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
