The Guardian said the US president \u201cseemed so out of step with the rest of the world that it was a case of the \u2018G1\u2019 versus the \u2018G19\u2019\u201d. The New York Times said the trip had chiefly been \u201cwelcome respite from the forever wars in Washington\u201d. And the Washington Post said the visit proved Trump was still \u201can unpredictable force on the world stage and an outlier among longtime American partners\u201d. But for Trump himself it was clear that the only way to truly sum up his second foreign trip was with a two-minute web video soundtracked by a choir belting out his campaign slogan over triumphant martial brass. \u201cMake America great again/ Make America great again / Lift the torch of freedom/ All across the land,\u201d the song begins, as pictures of Trump greeting Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Narendra Modi and other world leaders fly past in a style familiar to anyone who has used Apple\u2019s iMovie. There is room for plenty of shots of his wife and daughter (who helped make the summit great herself), and even a couple near the end of his controversial meeting with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s not the first song to turn Trump\u2019s catchphrase \u2013 adapted from Ronald Reagan \u2013 into a stirring anthem. Delegates at last year\u2019s Republican convention in Cleveland were treated to a rousing country-rock anthem on the same theme. But although this choral version is less catchy, the almost Germanic sound of this song is at least appropriate to the summit\u2019s location. And perhaps to the message of cultural nationalism he expounded in Poland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
