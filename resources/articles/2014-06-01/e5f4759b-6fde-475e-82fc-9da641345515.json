But this lean, purposeful set, for a quartet augmented by British sax pioneer Evan Parker, is entirely improvised. A thundering piano/drums opener eventually turns to free-jazz showers of sound; H\u00e9bert and Escreet shadow Parker's looping soprano sax cycles, and prepared-piano pluckings accompany deep outbreaths of the tenor sax. A dark piano reverie joins with violin-like patterns, and an exhilarating piece of flat-out free swing testifies to the quartet's new-found empathy. Plenty of interesting contexts have been devised for Parker's sound, but this is special, and it would be intriguing to hear it live.
