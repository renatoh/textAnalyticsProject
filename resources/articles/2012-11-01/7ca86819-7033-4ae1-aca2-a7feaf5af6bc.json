But commodity trader Glencore may finally be on the verge of clinching its \u00a350bn takeover of Xstrata. In what might resemble an election night special \u2013 only without commentary from a Dimbleby \u2013 Glencore's chief executive Ivan Glasenberg will spend the day staring at a screen waiting for the results from a series of shareholder polls at his target Xstrata, waiting to see if his long-held ambition to own the mining group is to be achieved. What the screen will show him, if City psephologists are to be believed, is Xstrata investors waving through the takeover while delivering yet another snub to its architects as a controversial \u00a3140m pay deal is scrapped. The results should start coming in just after an 8am (GMT) vote at Glencore \u2013 which looks like a shoo-in \u2013 before attention turns to the first in a series of Xstrata votes at 1pm (2pm in the company's base in Zug). Initially there will be two resolutions put to shareholders at a so-called court meeting: one to approve the merger with the controversial pay deal for Xstrata managers; and then another to approve the tie-up without. To pass, both resolutions need 75% of voting shareholders. Confused? It gets less clear. After those results have been announced, the court meeting will morph into an extraordinary general meeting when Xstrata shareholders will effectively be asked to vote on what they've just voted on. On the first question they will be asked to give the company the power to act on the court meeting resolutions and do the deal (you might think they already did); and then in the last vote they will be asked on whether on not to approve the retention payments (ditto). To get through, that final poll needs 50% of voting shareholders \u2013 but as Glencore is not allowed to vote its 34% stake and as 13% shareholder Qatar has already said it will abstain \u2013 only 25% of votes cast have to go against the resolution for it to be defeated. Most observers reckon that to be an odds-on shot. What then? Assuming the merger gets the go-ahead (Qatar says yes to that, so most assume it will) the process plods on. European competition regulators will decide by Thursday whether to begin a longer inquiry or not and, if you believe the Xstrata management, this might be the trigger when the group's top staff suddenly realise they are underpaid and start to leave. We will see. Theoretically, there is little preventing the enlarged company introducing a new secret pay scheme to keep them. But what happens if staff start quitting before regulatory approval? Who \u2013 Glencore or Xstrata \u2013 increases pay? \"I'm not sure anybody is quite sure about that,\" says one of the deal's insiders. Nine months on, there are still some little details that need working out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
