But because of their diversity, deciding on a green investment fund can be a bit more tricky. Standard advice is to consult an independent financial adviser. Unfortunately, traditional financial advisers don't know very much about the green investment sector. Their knowledge may be limited to the straightforward banking products provided by companies such as the Co-operative Bank. This is changing, but to make sure you are getting tailor-made ethical advice which respects your values and beliefs, go to an adviser who specialises in ethical investment.
