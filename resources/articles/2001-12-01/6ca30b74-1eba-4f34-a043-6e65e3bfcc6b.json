Octagon Motorsports, which has a 15-year contract to run the race, announced an additional \u00a310.6m programme of road and parking improvements which it hopes will satisfy the Fia world motorsport council when it meets in Monte Carlo on Friday. The changes, which include doubling the existing two-lane road which will link the A43 Silverstone bypass - still under construction - to the circuit entrance, are expected to be ready for next year's race, scheduled for July 5. Last week Sir Jackie Stewart, president of the British Racing Drivers' Club which owns Silverstone, phoned the Fia president Max Mosley to express his dismay over the threat to the track and the possible downgrading of the race. He pointed out that Silverstone was committed to a \u00a345m programme of improvements intended to be implemented by 2003, jointly funded by the BRDC, Octagon Motorsports and the formula one commercial-rights holder Bernie Ecclestone. Fia sources say Mosley told Stewart that the governing body was nearing the end of its patience with Silverstone. \"It's always jam tomorrow with Silverstone,\" said one insider, \"but the only jam they seem capable of producing is a traffic jam.\" Octagon is hoping that yesterday's announcement will be enough to avoid the downgrading of the track. Government funding or assistance would help, although given Tony Blair's embarrassment over the \u00a31m donation from Ecclestone in 1997 the government may be sceptical about helping a sport which seems awash with money. Mosley takes the point. \"I wouldn't feel at all comfortable asking for public money for work on the circuit itself or its infrastructure,\" he said yesterday. \"What we feel the government could do is to make sure the Silverstone bypass is completed in time for next year . . . give the necessary consents to enable Octagon to build the spur road leading to the track entrance and to have traffic plans in place that take full advantage and benefit of the new road layout.\" The clever money is on Silverstone getting the green light for 2002 from the world motorsport council. But it is far from a foregone conclusion. The voting could be uncomfortably tight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
