The London club, currently 10 points off the top four in the Premier League, are facing up to the probability of starting a campaign without Champions League football for the first time under Roman Abramovich\u2019s ownership. Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s winner ensured PSG progressed 4-2 on aggregate, while Eden Hazard was booed upon being substituted in the second half and Diego Costa was rendered highly doubtful for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final at Everton with a recurrence of a tendon problem. Hiddink conceded a disgruntled support had the right to voice their dissent at Hazard, who had risked further riling fans by swapping shirts with \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda at half-time. The Belgian, long courted by PSG, appeared to aggravate a long-standing hip complaint and rather hobbled from the fray 13 minutes from time. \u201cThey have the right to boo whatever they think,\u201d said the interim manager. \u201cOne always has the right to express what he is feeling. But he was having a bit of a problem with his injury on his hip. I\u2019m aware of the shirt-swapping \u2013 it would be too easy for me just to say I haven\u2019t seen it \u2013 and, yes, it should not be done. But in some countries it\u2019s normal for people to do it. It\u2019s in their culture. Maybe the players are both used to doing that, in the Latin world perhaps rather than in the north. It\u2019s not a big issue for me, or for them.\u201d That was in stark contrast to his predecessor Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s frustration at seeing Hazard conduct a post-match interview at Parc des Princes two years ago wearing a PSG shirt. The future of last season\u2019s double player of the year, who is contracted until 2020, and those of other members of this squad are likely to be revisited over the coming months as Chelsea seek to rebuild in an attempt to return to the Champions League in 2017\u201318. That process will be conducted without the competition\u2019s lavish revenue stream next term and with scrutiny very much on the shortcomings of their player recruitment over the past few years. \u201cIt\u2019s my opinion that Chelsea are in a transition period,\u201d said Hiddink, who is expected to hand over to the Italy manager, Antonio Conte, in the summer. \u201cThey have to see how they go on and try and regain the lost terrain where Chelsea used to be, that\u2019s true. It was always going to be difficult to get into fourth position. We tried to do our first job, to get out of the relegation zone, but it was a very big gap to go and reach the top four. Chelsea must consider its short-term future and how to handle what happens next. But they\u2019ve known this for a while.\u201d While PSG contemplate a fourth successive Champions League quarter-final, their dominance very evident in this victory and capped by Ibrahimovic\u2019s 50th European goal, Chelsea will rather limp into Saturday\u2019s FA Cup tie at Goodison Park with a patched-up side and battered pride. Costa, who scored their first-half equaliser, succumbed on the hour to the calf problem which had prompted him to miss last Saturday\u2019s draw with Stoke City. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if there\u2019s big damage tomorrow,\u201d added Hiddink. \u201cDiego was desperate to play, although he was not 100% fit, but he was desperate. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s become worse, but we\u2019ll have to see because we have another big game in two days\u2019 time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
