Reverend Eric Britt claimed to have faced a \"vociferous\" email hate campaign by disgruntled elderly congregants in two of the three parishes he served in Portugal. He says he was abandoned by his bishop following his attempt to introduce a stewardship scheme to improve the collection at his churches. The chaplain of the congregations of Almancil, Luz and St Luke's on the Algarve, who has been an ordained clergyman for more than 30 years and is a charismatic evangelical, has had his licence removed by the Church of England's diocese of Europe. But loyal parishioners are now calling for alternative oversight from another bishop outside the English church so he can continue ministering to them. In a statement, Mr Britt said: \"My style of ministry was not welcomed by some of the congregation who waged a campaign to get rid of me that included my being subjected to abusive phone calls and emails and some parishioners refusing to take communion from me. I had hoped that I would be able to stay but ... my bishop wanted to get rid of me which left me feeling very alone and depressed.\" The row, which festered over two years, culminated in Mr Britt requesting an episcopal visitation from the suffragan bishop of Europe, the Right Reverend David Hamid, who asked the archdeacon of Gibraltar to sort the matter out. Supportive parishioners claimed their views were disregarded in favour of what they described as \"a significant and powerful minority\" who objected to his ministry. One of Mr Britt's supporters, Paul Luckman told the Guardian: \"There are a lot of people who retire here from powerful backgrounds and find themselves with nothing else to do. They resented being asked to put their hands in their pockets for the stewardship programme.\" Rachael Maskell, national officer for clergy of the white collar union Amicus, which represents Mr Britt, said yesterday: \"This is an absolutely shocking case of bullying and discrimination but it demonstrates how vulnerable clergy are in these situations. They are being denied basic employment protection and face losing their livelihoods and their homes without the backing of their bishops.\" The Rev Paul Needle, spokesman for the diocese said: \"Our bishop feels very hurt by the allegation that he was not supportive. A generous remuneration package was agreed but we have now learned that Mr Britt and his supporters have been planning to set up their own church for months.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
