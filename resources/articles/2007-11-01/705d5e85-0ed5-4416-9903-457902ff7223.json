The group, which is already shedding 10,000 jobs and selling off seven Airbus plants, announced operating losses of \u20ac343m (\u00a3239m) in the first nine months, compared with profits of \u20ac1.43bn a year ago. EADS, damaged by delays to the A380 superjumbo, said it was taking a \u20ac1.4bn charge for delays of up to 12 months to its new A400M military transporter aircraft. The group said the weak dollar had cost it \u20ac660m in the third quarter alone. David Gow No road led to Rome for UK bus operator Italy's competition authority yesterday handed out fines totalling more than \u20ac10m (\u00a37m) after an investigation launched at the request of a British company. The authority found that 15 mostly publicly owned local bus firms ran a cartel to keep outsiders from entering the market. Terravision, which operates airport links for low-cost airlines, protested that a tender issued in 2005 by the Rome council was framed in such a way as to prevent it from bidding. The biggest fine, of \u20ac2.2 m (\u00a31.5m), was imposed on council-owned Rome transport firm Trambus. John Hooper in Rome Close Brothers reject smaller rival's offer Close Brothers has rejected a \u00a31.4bn takeover approach from Cenkos, claiming its 950p-a-share offer is \"wholly inadequate\". Cenkos is interested in Close's investment banking and asset management divisions and its consortium partner, Icelandic financial services firm Landesbanki, is looking at Close's banking arm. It is an audacious move; with a market capitalisation of \u00a3129.8m, Cenkos is one tenth the size of Close Brothers. KBC Peel Hunt analyst Robin Savage believes further approaches are probable. \"An immediate rebuff should, in some circumstances, be taken as a come-on.\" Antoinette Odoi"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
