Nick Milligan, a senior executive with BSkyB, and his daughter Emily died in the accident at one of Cornwall's most popular boating spots while his wife, Victoria, and their four-year-old son, Kit, suffered what police called \"life-changing\" leg injuries. An interim report revealed that before the accident the boat was manoeuvring \"at speed\" in the Camel estuary near Padstow. The report from the government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch, concluded that the 8m-long rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) was fitted with a kill cord but it was not attached to the driver. The report did not say who was driving at the time. It said: \"At approximately 3.49pm on Sunday 5 May 2013 a family of two adults and four children were ejected from their RHIB into the water. They were manoeuvring the boat at speed. Some members of the family were subsequently run over by the RHIB.\" The report said it was still not clear why the family was thrown from the boat. It continued: \"The RHIB was fitted with a kill cord, but this was not attached to the driver at the time of the accident. Consequently, when the driver was ejected from the boat, the kill cord did not operate to stop the engine and the RHIB continued to circle out of control, and at speed. \"As the RHIB circled, it ran over the family in the water a number of times, leading to the deaths and injuries. A few minutes later a local boatman was able to board the RHIB and bring it under control before further people were hurt.\" The report called on all boat owners and operators to make sure their boats were fitted with working kill cords \u2013 and to use them. It said: \"The kill cord serves only one purpose, to stop the engine when the driver moves away from the controls. To ensure that this tragic accident is not repeated it is essential that all owners and operators of vessels ensure they are fitted with kill cords.\" It concluded: \"Always attach the cord securely to the driver, ideally before the engine is started, but certainly before the boat is put in gear. Stop the engine before transferring the kill cord to another driver.\" The couple's two other daughters \u2013 Olivia, 10, and Amber, 12 \u2013 escaped with minor injuries in the accident. A full report will be published later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
