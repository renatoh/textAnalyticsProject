I was swimming in clear water and there was a small fish \u2013 about four inches, not dangerous at all \u2013 that was aggressively following me and poking me. It kept doing it \u2013 it freaked me out. I was like: \u201cI have to get away from this fucking crazy fish.\u201d I used to write songs in my apartment\u2019s bathroom \u2013 for privacy. One day my ex-wife was in there doing her makeup. She dressed quite goth, so it took a while. I was in the bedroom playing this song and she stuck her head out \u2013 and she never did this with any other song, ever \u2013 and said: \u201cThat\u2019s a good one, finish it.\u201d The recording took place in 1987 and was released on the Surfer Rosa album the following year. We worked with Steve Albini in the studio. We had a laissez-faire attitude, like, \u201cOh here\u2019s this idea that is completely unrealised and it goes like this \u2026\u201d It wasn\u2019t that we didn\u2019t care \u2013 maybe we were just on fire at the time. Steve\u2019s approach was more cavalier than thoughtful, it was just: \u201cLet\u2019s fucking try that.\u201d But I think his attitude worked because it blended well with the naivety of the band. We didn\u2019t know what we were doing but we did it well. There\u2019s something about the major to minor chord shift in the song that resonates along with the universal sentiment of the title. Sonically, if you had to pick a song to sum up our band this would be it. It\u2019s emblematic of what we do with that loud/quiet dynamic. I only listen to the original when it comes on in a coffee shop or something. It\u2019s funny, especially if I\u2019m in a place filled with young hipsters and I\u2019m just this middle-aged paunch-bellied man getting his espresso. Some people credit Fight Club for bringing the song to a larger audience. It was a great scene that highlighted it, so I suppose there must be some truth there. It\u2019s the song that pays my mortgage \u2013 it\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving. I get offers once a week for yet another advertisement, movie or TV show to use it. I say yes to all of them. Steve Albini, engineer/producer We recorded in a modest studio in Boston but it sounded great. The band played well and my job was pretty easy. There were parts of the song that needed a dynamic blow-up where things would get heavier but the band were playing through really small amps. I suggested some Marshall amps for the big loud parts \u2013 they took to that like a fish to water. I don\u2019t know if that was the first time they ever played with really powerful amps but they certainly made the most of them. The studio was limited \u2013 one performing room \u2013 so we used the big communal washroom. That became a reverb chamber where Kim Deal did her ghostly hoo-hoo backing vocals. Her voice has a really lovely sustain to it and I exaggerated that using a long electronic reverb to make it a structural element of the song as opposed to just decoration. That dynamic of me suggesting goofy stuff and them going along with it was partly due to my insecurity. It was early in my tenure as an engineer and I wanted to validate myself and have an impact. I\u2019d suggest ridiculous stuff, some of it worked and some of it didn\u2019t. I regret a lot of those decisions \u2013 not because they made the record worse but because they weren\u2019t wholly the band. Asserting myself in the production took away some of their authorship. Kim and I are close friends now and she has admitted to me that it was uncomfortable for her to have to answer all these interview questions about this crazy Steve Albini guy doing all these goofy sound effects. I regret the way I treated the band in print afterwards. Forced Exposure magazine got me to review albums that I had been credited as producer on. At the time, I bristled at the idea of being called a producer so I responded in a peculiar way and went overboard on being negative about those albums, and for Pixies\u2019 Surfer Rosa I went too far. Because of my intellectual insecurity I was associating arrogance and petulance with a purity of vision \u2013 thinking being frank was a mark of authenticity, but it was just an excuse to be rude. I\u2019ve made my apologies to the band, but they remain insufficient. Where is My Mind? later became one of the records that other bands would reference when they wanted to work with me. Over time it has acquired a status that it didn\u2019t have at the time. Nobody expected it to take off because no underground American band of that generation had even a fleeting notion of commercial success as a goal. People just wanted to blow minds. The Pixies\u2019 new single, Hear Me Out, is out now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
