The osteopath had planned 11 seminars and dinners throughout the country, where people could pay up to $200 to hear her talk about the \u201cdangers\u201d of vaccinations and have their photo taken with her. Guardian Australia recently revealed eight venues that were due to host Tenpenny had cancelled following mounting public pressure. On Wednesday night a joint announcement from Tenpenny and the Queensland-based tour organiser, Stephanie Messenger, was published on Facebook outlining their reasons for cancelling. \u201cWe have reached a point where we can no longer guarantee the safety of those attending the seminars,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe anti-free-speech terrorists have voiced bomb threats and have threatened violence against venue owners and their families.\u201d One venue owner, from Queensland, reported receiving a bomb threat, but that was later revealed to have come from an anti-vaccination advocate who was disturbed by the thought that Tenpenny\u2019s event might not go ahead. Tenpenny\u2019s opponents argued it would be irresponsible to allow her to deliver her talks given the overwhelming evidence for the benefits of vaccines. Large studies have concluded vaccinations are safe, and there is no link between them and autism and multiple sclerosis. Questions had also been raised about organisations tied to Messenger, including the GanKinMan Foundation, for which there is no listing on the websites of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission or the Australian Business Register. More recently, Messenger has become involved with the Church of Conscious Living, which was revealed last year to have been created for anti-vaccination parents to join so they could claim \u201creligious exemption\u201d as a reason not to vaccinate their children. Comments by Messenger on social media indicated Tenpenny was looking for alternative ways of spreading her message in Australia. \u201cWould Dr Tenpenny consider doing webinars,\u201d one person wrote, to which Messenger replied: \u201cWe are exploring all our options at this time \u2013 be patient \u2013 all will be revealed soon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
