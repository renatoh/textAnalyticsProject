Last week, the Canadian rapper Drake wore a watch bearing an explicit message to a basketball game. His unusual, eye-wateringly expensive timepiece, by the Swiss brand Richard Mille, came with an inbuilt phrase generator \u2013 meaning that while on this occasion it displayed something we shan\u2019t print, it could just as easily have read, at the milder end: \u201cI need to devour you madly,\u201d or: \u201cI long to explore you tonight.\u201d It may sound totally preposterous, but \u201cerotic watches\u201d have an unexpectedly long history \u2013 albeit watches that displayed pictures, rather than words. The tradition dates back to the 1750s, the era of the Jacobites, Captain Cook and tension along the Prussian-Hanoverian border \u2013 a time when, the Sotheby\u2019s New York watch department head Nate Borgelt told culture website the Cut, \u201cthere was still a very restricted moral view of sexuality, and a lot of repression\u201d. In the 18th century, a kinky watch might have been a naughty bit of fun, a way of satirising the buttoned-up society, as well as \u2013 Borgelt noted \u2013 a way for men to gauge ladies\u2019 interest at parties. Drake\u2019s watch is of a very different and ostensibly more sexually liberated world, and it doesn\u2019t come cheap: the Richard Mille RM 69 Erotic Tourbillon costs $750,000 (\u00a3600,000). But what if it sparks high-street versions? Could it start conversations about our sexual desires and needs? On the one hand, it is not such a shocking idea. \u201cWe are surrounded by opportunities to get in touch with our erotic selves via art, literature and fashion,\u201d says the psychosexual and relationship therapist Caroline Lovett. But while \u201canything that helps a meaningful conversation about sex, intimacy and relationships is good\u201d, Lovett is clear: this is not it. \u201cI see it as a gimmick \u2013 not something that allows people to express their emotional feelings.\u201d \u201cMass selling of watches like that, I could see it happening,\u201d says Owen Redahan, a sexual addiction therapist. But the likely reaction, he predicts, \u201cwould be: \u2018That\u2019s funny, why did you get it?\u2019 rather than: \u2018Let\u2019s talk about different sexual positions.\u2019\u201d So what courtside conversation was Drake trying to start with his erotic watch? The psychosexual therapist Cate Mackenzie speculates: \u201cIs he actually looking for sex, or is he just enjoying being admired?\u201d Redahan can\u2019t comment on Drake\u2019s motivations, but says that one might want to \u201cgive out an image of \u2018I\u2019m sexually mature, I don\u2019t mind talking about sex, I\u2019m open and able to do so\u2019.\u201d However he meant it, it brings a whole new meaning to wrist action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
