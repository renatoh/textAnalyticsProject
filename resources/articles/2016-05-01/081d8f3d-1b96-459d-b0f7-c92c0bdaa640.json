Both ideas have been floated by senior Uefa insiders as European football\u2019s governing body considers how to revamp the competition from 2018-19 onwards and head off renewed talk of a breakaway competition among bigger clubs. In light of the increase in viewers and profile sparked by moving the final to Saturday one idea being mooted is to move some Champions League matches to weekends during the later rounds. Another suggestion from some sides, also being discussed by the European Club Association, is that qualification would be based on a side\u2019s record over three seasons \u2013 making it less likely that the usual contestants would miss out. But Scudamore said the Premier League would strongly resist any such suggestion. The organisation\u2019s executive chairman said that, if other European leagues wish to consider awarding their Champions League places in a different way, they can but that the English top flight would remain \u201can open competition\u201d. \u201cIf you land in the first four places, you are in the Champions League and it is as simple as that. The idea you might average the qualification over a number of years just seems completely ridiculous.\u201d Given the Premier League\u2019s new \u00a38.3bn TV deal, much of the pressure for changes to European competition has come from clubs in Spain and Italy and Scudamore said he was perhaps minded to let national associations decide for themselves in conjunction with Uefa. \u201cWe are quite happy with our qualification system in England for our places.\u201d Scudamore, who was effusive about the effect of Leicester\u2019s title win on the competition, also said the idea of moving European matches to the weekend was a nonstarter. \u201cLook, in 1888 people used to tip out of factories at lunchtime on Saturday to play professional football on Saturday afternoons. Fundamentally we are a weekend competition,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain it is in nobody\u2019s interests running leagues anywhere in the world that the calendar is altered in that way. These are all things that are being bandied around and they are nowhere near coming to fruition and we would resist and fight and pull out all the stops.\u201d Scudamore also said he had no concerns over Brentford\u2019s decision to scrap their academy, predicting that other Football League clubs would follow suit as the changes brought in under its \u00a3340m elite player performance plan overhaul took effect. \u201cI think it\u2019s a brave move by Brentford. At the end of the day it\u2019s a matter for them if they think the late-developer model is the one for them. In some ways it is odd that we\u2019re running 91, 92 academies,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not our intention or our ambition but who is to say 92 is the right number? Who is to say 20 category-one [academies] is the right number.\u201d Scudamore was unapologetic about the fact that the best talent would flow to the biggest clubs with the best academies, but said the changes were designed so that Football League clubs would be compensated over time if players who moved to bigger clubs made it to the first team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
