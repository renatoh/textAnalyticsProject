This wasn't because my parents were different colours. I never really noticed that until later. It was because other families were extended, with grannies and grandads, aunties and uncles and cousins. My family had no one, and no history. It was as if we had landed out of nowhere, with no points of reference. To all intents and purposes, my father was an orphan, having been dumped on the steps of a Barnardo's home when he was five. He was a minor clerk by day, a brilliant jazz musician by night, without two pennies to rub together. My mother had no one either, except a distant sister she rarely saw, but none of us questioned why. It was just the way things were. My mother was born in India in 1928. I was born in London in 1964, four years before Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech. Mixed marriages were still a rarity, and my parents' was the only one I knew of. We lived in a tatty house with holes in the carpets. The furniture was falling to pieces and all the utilities were coin-operated. I did not realise we were poor until I was about seven, and I didn't understand how it had come about. My mother was delicate, like a bird, and had all kinds of beautiful things hidden away in a black leather steamer trunk \u2013 exquisite silk dresses and hand-embroidered satin housecoats, a velvet evening bag with two huge natural pearls on the clasp, some wonderful pieces of jewellery and crewel-worked Kashmir shawls \u2013 and she was well educated and widely travelled with a beautiful speaking voice. My mother never talked about her life. I used to ask her where she was from, and she would say Assam, but not much else. The subject was always quickly closed and never furnished with any detail. I did not even know where Assam was. I had to look it up in an atlas. I also knew I had a grandfather who lived on a farm in Africa, in Rhodesia, as it was known then. I had seen a photograph of him in an officer's uniform, a handsome thick-set man with dark hair and a moustache. It was the only picture we had of him, and I knew he had been an engineer in the Indian army because that is what we were told. She never mentioned her mother, ever, and I knew not to ask. To do so would only provoke profound upset, and that was never my intention. I just needed to know who my mother was, and what had brought her to this difficult, disjointed life, of which I was now a part. Sometimes she would let me look through her old photograph album and would tell me who the people were and where the pictures had been taken \u2013 places such as Bangalore, Kashmir, the Himalayas. There was a picture of her friend, the woman I knew as Auntie Joan, lounging on a beach in Bombay, looking impossibly glamorous in a starlet's bathing costume. Auntie Joan lived with her husband and four kids in a council flat on a huge red-brick housing estate in west London. It was a happy house, but it was a grim place. I didn't understand how these beautiful young women could have come from those achingly scenic landscapes to the grey skies of racist Britain. Sometimes our letterbox would rattle as kids shouted Paki through the door and then ran away. My constant questions drove my mother mad, but as I grew older, her answers just didn't add up. There were too many holes in her story. I knew she was angry and unhappy, and that she bitterly resented her circumstances. To make matters worse, her sister had married well, and lived between a servanted perquisite residence in Chittagong and a smart house in Henley-on-Thames. On my aunt's rare visits to us, my mother would behave strangely. She would remind us that children were to be seen and not heard, and we would be banished upstairs. We barely spoke to our aunt. It was not encouraged. Some years on, I pestered my mother about why she had never gone to Africa to visit her father. It seemed ridiculous to me when there were such things as aeroplanes. My mother got very cross and eventually said that for a brown face to turn up on her father's doorstep \"just wouldn't do\". Those were her exact words. It was my father who took me aside one day and whispered that my mother and her sister were born outside of marriage. They were the children of a British tea-planter, born to his Indian concubine, and the shame of it had followed my mother like a shadow her whole life. I have no doubt she thought the world would come tumbling down if anyone found out, for that is what she had been conditioned to believe. My mother and her sister were taken from their mother, aged about five and seven, and sent to a remote convent to be educated, before being trained as nurses. They were not the only ones. Their path brought them into contact with other girls who had been born in similar circumstances. One thing they all had in common was that they were lucky enough to have been properly provided for, rather than being abandoned and denied as so many others were. My mother was just 11 when she last saw her father. She has no idea what happened to her mother. On the day she left school, she was taken into the mother superior's office and told that the woman she thought to be her aunt, her father's sister, was actually his wife. As the years wore on, my mother began to talk to me, as though unburdening herself of every memory, good or bad. We pored over maps, trawled through old pictures and keepsakes, and trudged around India. She cried a lot, too, which was hard. Recently, she gave me a box of letters and photographs that I had never seen before. I don't think anyone else had either. About 20 years ago, when she was in her 60s, my mother disclosed to her sister that she had told her family about their past. Her sister was furious, having kept the secret from her own children. My mother shrugged off her anger and told her we all thought it was marvellous and very romantic. Although it wasn't romantic, of course. It was tragic and heartbreaking and had left two women's lives with a backdrop of unspeakable sorrow. My mother imparted her stories to me over many, many years. She told me things that she had never told anyone \u2013 not just her secrets, but those of her friends, my \"aunties\". I came to know things that their own children didn't know, and probably still don't. Nobody talked about these things. They still don't. I promised my mother that I would remember her stories, and pass them on to my own children, so they might always have a sense of belonging. All my aunties are now dead, my mother is the only survivor. Any sense of shame about the past has long since fallen away. She has learned to be proud of who she is and where she came from, just as we are. \u2022 The Secret Children by Alison McQueen is published by Orion, \u00a37.99.
