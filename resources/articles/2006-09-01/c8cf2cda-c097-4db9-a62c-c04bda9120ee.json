Arnesen, the club's director of youth development, was secretly filmed offering to give the youngster \u00a3150,000 over three years to try to induce him to Stamford Bridge. The revelation comes just over a month after Chelsea were accused by their former chairman Ken Bates of illegally poaching two players from his academy at Leeds United and tapping up a third, who stayed at Elland Road. Chelsea denied any wrongdoing in that case and were waiting to see last night's broadcast before deciding whether to make any comment on this latest episode. It is likely to lead to an investigation by the Premier League, which gave Chelsea a suspended three-point penalty last year for an illegal approach to Cole. The accusations are, at the very least, unfortunate for Arnesen, who joined Chelsea from Tottenham last September. His move across the capital was messy, with Spurs claiming Chelsea made an illegal approach for the Dane, suspending Arnesen from his post as sporting director and threatening to report Chelsea to the Premier League. Arnesen was photographed aboard a yacht belonging to Chelsea's owner Roman Abramovich, and Chelsea paid substantial compensation to Tottenham to bring him to the club. Arnesen was shown by Panorama in a meeting with the agent Peter Harrison to discuss Middlesbrough's 15-year-old Nathan Porritt, who has played for England at youth level. Arnesen said he was willing to offer Porritt \u00a3150,000 to move to Chelsea and, according to the programme, discussed where he saw the youngster fitting into the club's academy formation. \"One-fifty thousand spread in three years and we can do it like a loyalty bonus and this and this, salary we can talk about that,\" Arnesen said. The programme states that Middlesbrough have confirmed they did not give permission for this approach and that Harrison, the player's agent, admitted Boro did not know he was offering Porritt to rival clubs. Harrison is filmed saying of Porritt that it is \"99.9% sure he's leaving Middlesbrough,\" though the youngster has stayed at Boro, whom he joined aged nine. Harrison is also secretly filmed offering Porritt to Liverpool, who are shown to be keen on the player. \"I think we could sign him and then bring him here at 17,\" a Liverpool official said. \"Definitely bring him here because he becomes a pro.\" The principal focus will, though, fall on Chelsea because of various other tapping-up accusations levelled at them over recent seasons. They were found guilty of an illegal approach for Ashley Cole after it was revealed they met the left-back without Arsenal's permission at a London hotel. Chelsea were fined by the Premier League and given a suspended three-point penalty. Last month they signed Cole in a deadline-night deal that took the defender William Gallas in the opposite direction. Bates suggested activating that points penalty when he accused Chelsea of tapping up the Leeds youngsters Michael Woods and Tom Taiwo before signing them and making an illegal approach for Daniel Rose, who chose not to move. \"It is not a question of punishing Chelsea for this latest breach,\" Bates said. It is a question of stopping them doing it in the future. Because of the financial strength of the owner, financial punishments alone will make no difference to them at all.\" Chelsea's conduct vis-a-vis the Leeds players is being investigated out jointly by the Football Association and Premier League. It will be determined whether disciplinary action is required and, if so, which body will look after that. This case involving Arnesen may follow a similar pattern, though with two Premiership clubs being involved, the Premier League may deal with the case alone if, as seems likely, it chooses to investigate. Arnesen has kept a relatively low profile during his year at Chelsea. The 49-year-old former Denmark international is understood to have played a role this summer in bringing Salomon Kalou and John Obi Mikel to Stamford Bridge, where they form part of the first-team squad. His previous jobs include a period as assistant coach at PSV Eindhoven to Bobby Robson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
