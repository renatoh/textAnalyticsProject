The flying helmet is not of British cut, the aeroplane is a Junkers 88 \u2013 a stalwart of the Luftwaffe \u2013 and the posed snap has all the marks of a German propaganda shot\u201d (\u201cAnother dazzling tale takes flight\u201d, New Review, last week, page 38). We misquoted Natalie Bennett, who has confirmed that she will remain at the helm of the Green party, as saying that she had been re-elected to serve a three-year term. Green leadership terms are in fact two years, not three (\u201cBennett vows to stay on as leader after \u2018Green surge\u2019\u201d, News, last week, page 4). A racing report, \u201cKilimanjaro wins but still has mountain to climb in Derby\u201d (Sport, last week, page 16), mistakenly said that Aidan O\u2019Brien trains the first three in the betting on the Oaks at Epsom this year. That should have been two of the first three. To clarify: Legatissimo, the favourite, is trained by David Wachman.
