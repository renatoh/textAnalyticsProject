It was massive effort. I\u2019m so happy for our fans who are here, in London and around the world ... It\u2019s so important for the club to go to the next stage of the Champions League. \u201cI was relaxed on the touchline, I always believed it was possible to win. We created a lot of chances and it was always a game we had under control ... I think we fully deserve to go to the next stage. I think Barcelona and us were the best teams in a difficult group.\u201d \u201cWe showed what is possible if you have belief. [Feats such as this] build your character as a group. I hope and wish that we build something special [here] and we can go on and achive something this season.\u201d David Hytner is at the Camp Nou and here\u2019s what he made of all that drama: Lloris and Kane are speaking to BT. The goalkeeper says: \u201cWe had help from PSV, thankfully for us. It was difficult to come back into this game after the early goal but we stuck to the basics. Kane adds: \u201cWe had a quite a few chances, the keeper made some good saves and it just wasn\u2019t going in for us. We didn\u2019t know what the score was in the other match so we just kept going for it.\u201d Lloris, however, reveals he did not know the score after asking Llorente following the Spaniard\u2019s late introduction. \u201cAnd I understood we had gone through when I heard the Spurs fans, they made such a noise!\u201d Spurs were the better team for most of the match even though Barcelona\u2019s makeshift team produced some dangerous spurts and took the lead through an excellent goal by Dembele. Spurs had a lot of control and there were some tremendous individual performances (Rose, Sissoko, Eriksen and for a while Son). Now Spurs players and fans rejoice at the Camp Nou. Lucas Moura\u2019s late equaliser has secured their passage into the knockout stages! For a while it looked like their wastefulness in front of goal would cost them, but they kept creating chances and eventually took one. Instead it\u2019s Inter who are afflicted by regrets. But no one knows what that means yet because Inter and PSV are still playing in Milan. It\u2019s 1-1 there, too, but if Inter grab a winner, they will progress and eliminate Spurs .... 90+2 min: Messi exchanges passes with Coutinho and then ... slips as he tries to find the net from 20 yards! 90+1 min: Spurs fans are crooning loudly in the Nou Camp. They know that as things stand, their team is going through... 90 min: There will be at least four more minutes. Anything could still happen in this group... 89 min: Brilliant move by Spurs! Lamela and Kane combined before Kane played a sweet reverse pass through to Rose, who came charging into the box from the left. He has a clear sight of goal from 15 yards! But he bangs it high and wide, just as Kane did earlier. Spurs have missed some terrific chances to make this a far less tense finish. 87 min: Messi tries to float a freekick past Lloris from over 25 yards. It goes past Lloris, alright, but also past the photographers behind the goal. 86 min: Spurs barely celebrated that goal. They know they may need another - if Inter score against PSV - and also that Barcelona could score again, too. This is a tense and utterly unpredictable finale! Spurs have finally broken through! Kane ran into the box from the left and crossed low for Moura, who prodded into the net from close range! 85 min: Coutinho darts into the left-hand side of the box and then aims a curling right-footed shot around Vertonghen and towards the far corner. But it bounces out off the post! Spurs substitution: Llorente on, Winks off. Pochettino has played Spurs\u2019 last card. 82 min: Messi and Coutinho try to work an opening at the edge of the Spurs\u2019 box, but Alderweireld puts paid to that plan. Alli tries to lead a rapid Spurs counter but Bar\u00e7a file back quickly to head them off. 80 min: Bar\u00e7a are not missing any opportunities to waste time. But if Spurs go out, it\u2019s the opportunities they\u2019ve missed themselves that\u2019ll really rile them. 78 min: Vertonghen gets another attack going with a smart pass from the back. Spurs work it wide to the overlapping Sissoko, who\u2019s had a fine game so far. But this cross lacks accuracy this time. 75 min: Moura, on for Son, meets a cross by Sissoko six yards out. His header is not clean and gives Cillessen just enough time to push it away after a lightning quick dive! Another agonising miss for Spurs. 74 min: Messi, springing to life for the first time since his introduction, skedaddles past two Spurs players before Sissoko stops him. 73 min: Over in Milan, Icardi has struck an equaliser for Inter. That means defeat here wouldn\u2019t be good enough for Spurs. They need to draw at least, and hope Inter don\u2019t score again. 70 min: Lamela feeds Rose, who clips a dainty ball over from the left. Eriksen meets it on the run at the back post. Cillessen makes a fine save. But it doesn\u2019t matter because the ref had blown for a foul in the six-yard box by Kane. The England striker\u2019s having a stinker so far. 69 min: Lamela, who\u2019s looked vibrant since his introduction, overplays after a promising Spurs move. 68 min: Semedo booked for chopping down Rose near halfway. 67 min: Lamela\u2019s oustswing corner from the left is met by Kane with a decent header. Miranda sticks out a foot to block it, then Kane\u2019s follow-up is blocked also. 66 min: Semedo charges 60 yards forward down the right flank, before Rose puts an end to his mischief. 65 min: Yes, PSV are still leading 1-0 at Inter. Barcelona substitution: Messi on, Munir off. Have Spurs missed their chance? 62 min: Sissoko seems to have shunted to right-back after the departure of Walker-Peters. Spurs substitution: Lamela on, Walker-Peters off. 61 min: Lamela is getting ready to come on for Spurs. There\u2019s a good case for taking off Kane. 59 min: Spurs have worked some tremendous openings so far but been terribly wasteful. If they don\u2019t advance, they\u2019ll regret how often they\u2019ve shot themselves in the foot in this group. 57 min: Lovely work down the left by Spurs but Rose\u2019s cross finds no one. Moments later Spurs produce even slicker interplay to give Son a shooting opportunity from the edge of the area. He drills one low ... but straight at Cillessen. 55 min: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 breaks free down the right again, then picks out a smart pass to Coutinho near the penalty spot. The Brazilian feints and then lets fly ... but Walker-Peters throws himself in front of his shot to make an outstanding block! 53 min: Kane is sent clear on goal! Lenglet is chasing him but won\u2019t catch him. Kane reaches the edge of the area, looks up to assess the position of the keeper .... and then lofts the ball high into the sky. I think he was trying to rocket it into the top corner but he somehow lost his balance and missed by miles. 52 min: Spurs hurtle down the other end. Kane crosses from the left. Alli\u2019s sht from 15 yards is blocked but rebounds to Eriksen, whose effort is also blocked, this time by Lenglet. 51 min: Rose does well to usher Semedo out of play after Bar\u00e7a broke dangerously into the box. 49 min: Coutinho careers into Walker-Peters to concede a freekick near half-way. 48 min: Kane cushions the ball back to Eriksen, who tries to curl a left-footed effort in the far corner from the edge of the box. Cillessen pushes it behind for a corner. 46 min: Eriksen releases the impressive Sissoko down the right. The Frenchman aims a cross on the run for Kane. But he was too hasty and Kane wasn\u2019t free, so Bar\u00e7a cut it out. Barcelona substitution: Busquets on, Rakitic off. Cuffs \u2018round the ear ahoy! \u201cBarcelona have looked like an utter rabble, though admittedly a rabble who can do the odd pirouette, shuffle and zoom,\u201d notes Charles Antaki. \u201cBut the ball-losing, space-leaving, after-you-Claudery is the dominant theme. Much more of this and Busquets and Vidal will be sent on, if only to give out a few cuffs round the ear.\u201d Spurs started slowly and fell behind to a wonderful solo goal by Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. But the visitors then got their act together and began to expose frailties in the makeshift home defence. They have every chance of getting back into this game, even if Bar\u00e7a still carry a threat on the break (and have a rather formidable-looking bench if needed). As things stand, Spurs would progress even if they lose because Inter are trailing at home to PSV - but Pochettino &amp; Co sure can\u2019t bank on that score remaining the same. 44 min: Coutinho turns beautifully past Winks and then drives into the box from the left. He tries to poke a low shot into the far corner, but instead it hits the outside of the post and travels wide. 43 min: Rakitic scurries forward from half-way. When he reaches the edge of the Spurs\u2019 box, Alderweireld slips, giving the Croatian extra room for a shot. He lets fly. But Lloris makes a comfortable save. 41 min: Son helps the ball on to Kane at the left-hand side of the Barcelona box. Kane drops a shoulder and tries to shift past Vermaelen but he is one forward with whom Vermaelen can keep up. The Belgian deflects the striker\u2019s shot behind for a corner. 40 min: Walker-Peters has made a couple of mistakes so far but that has not affected him: he continues to dash forward and make himself available as a useful service provider down the right. 38 min: Sissoko is having a fine game. He\u2019s just won the ball in midfield and offloaded to Son, who had a crack from 20 yards. He hit it hard and low but straight at the keeper. 36 min: Eriksen is popping up everywhere now. Son is looking menacing, too. If Alli and Kane can get going, Spurs may yet turn this around. 34 min: Eriksen slides a pass through to Son, who skitters away from Vermaelen and finds himself one-on-one with the keeper. He aims for the far corner but Cillersen stands up and makes the save! Son will be disgusted at missing the chance but encouraged by how much Vermaelen is starting to struggle now that Spurs have found some attacking vim. 33 min: Kane donks a feeble freekick into the wall. 32 min: Vermaelen jumps in rashly on Eriksen just outside the left-hand corner of Bar\u00e7ca box. Freekick to Spurs in a dangerous positions. Kane fancies it ... 30 min: Eriksen is starting to find space. Sissoko feeds him, then the Dane slips the pass wide to the Rose, who has sprinted up to join in the attack. Rose curls a hard and low ball across the face of goal. Son lunges at it but narrowly fails to connect from six yards out! 28 min: Walker-Peters races down the right to offer a useful passing option, which Eriksen takes up. But the defender\u2019s cross is blocked and then Sissoko slips as he tries to regain possession. Then he pulls back an opponent as Barcelona try to launch another counter from inside their own half. 27 min: Barcelona continue to do as they please, right up until Alena\u2019s curled shot from 25 yards refuses to dip under the bar. 26 min: Rose bursts past Semedo down the right and then crosses towards Kane, who never looked like getting it. The game has mostly passed Kane by so far. 24 min: Eriksen swings in a corner from the right. It\u2019s another inadequate delivery from the midfielder. 22 min: Son is down in the centre circle, holding the base of his back. The medics come on to give him a rub. Pochettino might be minded to walk on, too, to give the rest of his players a slap round the chops. They\u2019re not at the races at the moment. 21 min: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s freekick is headed clear by Kane. 19 min: Lenglet pings a ball wide the Semedo on the right. The Portuguese s clattered by Rose, giving Barcelona a freekick near the corner flag. 16 min: Coutinho threatens down the left again but the move breaks down when he slips a pass through to Miranda, who had strayed offside. Meanwhile, the crowd are making plenty of noise as they chant slogans and displays banners such as this: 14 min: Munir flicks on a frekick from the left at the near post. It\u2019s wellied clear before Vermaelen can touch it in at the far post. 12 min: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is having a party. The only way Spurs can get the ball off him is by fouling him. Meanwhile on the right, Coutinho is starting to perk up, too. Walker-Peters has just been booked for tripping him. 11 min: Good news for Spurs: PSV have taken a shock lead at Inter. In the unlikely event of the scores remaining the same in both matches, Spurs will go through!. 9 min: Bar\u00e7a are out to hit Spurs again while they\u2019re down. They pour forward, eventually working it to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 at the right-hand corner of the box. He jinks and ducks and tries to bang a low cross into the danger zone, but it\u2019s cut out. 8 min: Guess resting Messi isn\u2019t that much of a mercy when you\u2019ve got players who can do what Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 just did. What a strike on the counter! Eriken\u2019s weak freekick from the right was headed clear by Munir. Walker-Peters was shunted off it by Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who raced 50 yards forward and then duped Winks with a canny feint before firing a cool low shot past Lloris. 6 min: Walker-Peters makes a bright run down the right wing, skipping past one opponent before being tripped by Miranda. That gives Spurs a useful freekick wide on the right. Eriksen will surely cross it in ... 5 min: Spurs file back diligently as Bar\u00e7a piece together several passes with making much progress. The hosts have yet to find any sort of groove. 3 min: Eriksen and Kane combine at the edge of the home box before the Englishman is crowded out as he tries to get off a shot. 2 min: Spurs spend the first minute in the Bar\u00e7a half without making any gains. Bar\u00e7a then try to take the play into the visitors\u2019 territory but Tottenham prevent them. Sissoko has made a strong start in centra midfield. 1 min: Bar\u00e7a-Spurs is go! Before kickoff there is a short and solemn tribute to Josip Lluis Nunez, the former Barcelona president, who has died. The players stride out on to the pitch, with some 4,500 Spurs fans struggling and failing to be heard above some 90,000 locals. Those locals whistle and jeer to drown out the Champions League jingle, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a must-win game, of course, it\u2019s like a final,\u201d ays the manager before explaining he has no doubts about Kyle Walker-Peters\u2019 ability to cope with the occasions on what is his Champions League debut. \u201cOne and a half years ago he won the U-20 World Cup with England so he has enough experience to play this type of game. He can cope with the pressure of playing in a game like this, that is not a problem. He may perform well or not well but the most important thing is he\u2019s going to be a big player for Tottenham.\u201d When asked about Bar\u00e7a\u2019s team selection, he said: \u201cWe are playing Barcelona and we need to be thinking about delivering the job, not who is in front [of us] and who is on the bench. Barcelona have an unbelievable squad, players who can play in any team in Europe. But if we are consistent and aggressive and show great energy, I think we are going to be close to winning.\u201d There have been several mentions in the buildup to the necessity for Spurs to cope with the sheer size of the pitch at the Camp Nou. According to Bar\u00e7a\u2019s website, it measures 105 metres x 68 metres for Champions League matches. Whereas at Wembley, Spurs\u2019 temporary home, the pitch measures 105 metres x 68 metres. I\u2019m saying they should cope. You\u2019d think they\u2019d know he\u2019s not reading this Here are the starting lineups from Milan. PSV\u2019s selection suggests they are not treating this as a dead rubber, at least not from the start. Inter: Handanovic, D\u2019Ambrosio, de Vrij, Skriniar, Asamoah, Politano, Candreva, Brozovic, Valero, Perisic, Icardi. PSV: Zoet, Dumfries, Sainsbury, Viergever, Angelino, Hendrix, Gutierrez, Rosario, Bergwijn, de Jong, Lozano \u201cSo Barcelona have seven first-choice players left on the bench - what did Valverde say again?\u201d tut-tuts Geoff Saunders. \u201cIt is never easy for any team to win at the Nou Camp but surely this side gives Spurs their best ever chance.\u201d Yup. Messi starts on the bench! Barcelona: Cillessen; Semedo, Lenglet, Vermaelen, Miranda; Arthur, Alena, Rakitic; Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Munir, Coutinho Subs: Ter Stegen, Piqu\u00e9, Busquets, D Suarez, Messi, Alba, Vidal Spurs: Lloris; Walker-Peters, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose; Sissoko, Winks; Eriksen, Alli, Son; Kane Subs: Gazzaniga, Lamela, Dier, Llorente, Moura, Davies, Skipp Referee: M Mazic (Serbia) Hello. Barcelona are not invincible. And yet, the instruction \u201cBeat Barcelona at the Nou Camp\u201d still sounds like one of the lesser-mentioned labours of Hercules or the improbable plot of an action-packed romp starring Harrison Ford. But Tottenham Hotspur must do it today if they are to avoid Champions League doom. Their adventure is sure to make a for a fun watch. To be precise, it is possible that Spurs could advance even without winning here \u2013 they need to gain the same result, or better, at the Nou Camp than Internazionale gain at home to PSV. Given that the Dutch have managed one point from their five group matches so far and have nothing to play for but the pleasure of sabotaging the Italians, Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men have to work on the assumption that only victory will do for them. Bar\u00e7a, meanwhile, can play with the liberating insouciance (or the sloppiness?) of a side that is already guaranteed top spot in the group. Their manager, Ernesto Valverde, has vowed not to field a bunch of reserves and hinted strongly that he will let Lionel Messi make merry again, as he did when giving Spurs the run-around at Wembley. And even if Bar\u00e7a are not at full-strength \u2013 owing to injuries and selections \u2013 when has it ever been easy to win at the Nou Camp? Even on Spurs\u2019 previous visit there in a bygone era \u2013 for the second leg of 1982 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup semi-final, when Bar\u00e7a were ferocious hatchetmen and the match had to be stopped because of a floodlight failure, for goodness sake \u2013 Spurs left empty-handed and peeved, on the end of a 1-0 defeat. Today they have a chance to write a new page in their history in BIG BOLD LETTERS. Or this season\u2019s Champions League campaign will be remembered as but a footnote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
