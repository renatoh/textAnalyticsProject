The Metropolitan police has said it will protect the right of protestors to demonstrate peacefully but will clamp down on any attempt to disrupt the torch relay, Olympic events or the so-called \"Games lanes\" that will ferry competitors, media and VIPs around London. Blanket coverage of the protester who successfully brought the Boat Race to a halt on Saturday, police moves to clear protestors from a site in Hackney earmarked as an Olympic training venue and a partially successful attempt by a protest group on Wednesday to fool the media into believing BP had been dropped as a sponsor have raised the prospect of widespread disruption. But Paul Deighton, chief executive of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog), said it would attempt to play down the prospect of protests in an attempt to dissuade copycats. \"I don't think we need to get ourselves too excited if one or two of these things happen. It's playing precisely into the hands of those people who want to get attention. Let's take it in our stride, move on and take no notice of it,\" said Deighton. \"Ultimately, the people of the country will decide whether they're prepared to tolerate this wonderful event being interrupted. What you need to do is have procedures in place so that if something happens, you can move pretty quickly and deal with it.\" The 70-day torch relay, which begins in Land's End on 19 May, the marathon and the cycling road race are among the events that could be targeted by protesters. \"Let's not hype it up in any way. Maybe it will happen and maybe it won't. If it does, we'll just carry on,\" said Deighton. He said it was inevitable that some protesters would target the Games. \"I have a simple philosophical view about this. People have the right to protest and express their point of view. I think that's wonderful,\" said Deighton. \"When it gets to the point where their clamour for recognition stifles the joy of millions, we all have to look at it and deal with it. In some ways the reaction to the weekend wasn't a bad thing for people to think about what it really means.\" A group calling itself the Campaign for a Sustainable Olympics fooled some media outlets into believing BP had been dropped as a 2012 sponsor by producing a replica of the official website. \"Choosing BP as Sustainability Partner is like putting Charlie Sheen in charge of keeping the Olympics drugs-free,\" said Harry Broadbent, a member of the group. \"Locog clearly named its sustainability partners purely on the basis of who wrote the biggest cheque.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
