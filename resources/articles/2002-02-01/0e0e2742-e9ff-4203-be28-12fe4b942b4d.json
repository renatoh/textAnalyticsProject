Are there any colourful festivals we can attend? Lesley Abbott, by email Probably the most spectacular is the annual Scoppio del Carro - Explosion of the Cart - on Easter Sunday (31 March) in Florence's Piazza del Duomo. In the morning, the carro (cart) is drawn through the streets by two white oxen and accompanied by costumed revellers. The archbishop lights the rocket during Mass and it travels along a wire, hits the cart and ignites a load of fireworks. Originally a pagan harvest ritual, it is now believed that if the event goes smoothly it will bring good luck to the city. Easter weekend is also your last chance to see the Faces of Marble exhibition; 22 classical sculptures rescued and restored after the 1966 floods, and unseen for 30 years, are on show at the Palazzo Medici until 31 March. For further details of what's on in Florence, contact the Italian Tourist Office (020 7408 1254). If you haven't booked accommodation yet, don't delay another second - it'll be packed. The Indian Himalaya I'm planning a trek with a friend in the Garhwal and Kumaon areas of the Indian Himalaya in May. We are experienced trekkers in Nepal and India but your opinion on the safety of this area would be appreciated. Miss E.M. Davis, Fish Hoek, South Africa The Himalayan north west of Uttar Pradesh state is home to some of India's finest peaks, glaciers and most dramatic views. The source of the Ganges is the snout of a glacier near Gangotri, a place of great pilgrimage. Kumaon, made famous by tiger-hunter Jim Corbett's book Man-Eaters of Kumaon, contains numerous challenging hikes and some stunning scenery. Mid-May (just before the monsoon) is the best time to go. The area is generally safe; the Foreign and Commonwealth Office doesn't advise against visiting the region, and it's certainly more advisable to go here than to Kashmir, which is off limits to travellers. Some parts of the region are sensitive border areas that may be restricted for foreigners, such as immediately around Nanda Devi (at 25,636ft, the highest mountain entirely within India). However, popular destinations like the Pindari and Milam glaciers are available on all-inclusive packages from operators in Delhi and Nainital. With your trekking experience you should have a rewarding trip. Lonely Planet's Trekking in the Indian Himalaya (\u00a311.99) contains a good rundown of popular treks in the area. Return to Calais We're thinking of going to France this summer but were surprised at how expensive ordinary Eurotunnel tickets are. Is it possible to buy two cheap day-return tickets (one Folkestone-Calais, the other Calais-Folkestone) instead of the expensive five-day return ticket? Mrs Bunbury, Surrey Eurotunnel is currently offering cheap day-returns between Folkestone and Calais from \u00a349. In theory it seems like a good idea to buy two tickets and only use up one journey leg each time, but in practice this is not possible. You would get over to France OK but you'd run into problems on your return. When it is realised that you haven't used up your outward journey you will be liable to pay the difference between \u00a349 and a standard single journey. It works out much cheaper to buy a five-day return (from \u00a3180). Special promotional fares are also available in France (tel 00 33 3 21 00 61 00 for details), but again the same restrictions apply - both legs of the journey must be used or you will be charged for a standard single fare. For fares and availability, contact Eurotunnel (0870 535 3535). Kiwi working-holiday visas The New Zealand and Australian media have reported changes to the UK working-holiday visa scheme. Currently we're allowed to visit the UK for two years and are not permitted to work in our trained professions. There have been speculative reports that the length of visits will be reduced to one year or less. Do you have any further details? Leigh Park, New Zealand The proposed changes to the current working-holiday scheme were included in the controversial white paper on nationality and asylum published by the Government earlier this month. While the white paper does propose changes to the working-holiday scheme, these may not necessarily be bad news for those wishing to work in the UK. The restriction preventing visitors from career work is likely to be removed, and the scheme may well be opened up to residents of other countries. The two-year fixed period is also likely to be reviewed, with the aim of being more flexible. There is no fixed timetable for these changes, nor indeed guarantees that they will happen, because after a consultation period they are subject to parliamentary procedure. You can view the proposals in detail on the British High Commission for New Zealand website where there is also a comments form so you can give your views. If you want to make sure you get your visa before regulations change, keep tabs on developments and make regular enquiries at the British High Commission. Over to you... readers' feedback With reference to Lisa McQuillan's enquiry about a romantic, warm honeymoon destination (27 January), you suggest Turkey - an excellent idea. I'd like to add that Side would be ideal. About 60km east of Antalya, the town is set on a peninsula and built among the ruins of a Roman city - temples, agoras and a theatre are still present . Side has large sandy beaches, and its setting ensures cool sea breezes, even on hot days. Try the Beach House Hotel for accommodation. Adrian Brine, Amsterdam \u00b7 We welcome letters.
