David Cameron has cancelled the victory parade and even persuaded Boris Johnson that this year's Tory conference must be a sombre, gaffe-free affair. But up pops Two Brains to fan the flames of class resentment with his \"Bridget Jones\" theory of family breakdown. How so? More young women go to university now (45%) than young men (35%), Willetts told a conference fringe meeting in downtown Brum last night. Hurrah, but that means a dearth of educated males in the marriage market. \"Bridget Jones is a real phenomenon,\" he revealed. Men who \"can't bring home the bacon\" are contributing to the collapse of family life: QED, as Willetts would say in his native Latin. How the Sun will break the news that they are useless to its bloke readers in social class D and E remains to be seen. \u2022 Talking of Britain's \"broken society\", Dave backtracked on the phrase when he spoke on BBC TV's Andrew Marr show yesterday. Even Boris agrees that only bits of it are broken, he insisted. Funny, that's not what the conference video says. \"We can repair our broken society.\" No ifs or buts. \u2022 Despite their Cameroon sheen the Conservatives have not quite shaken off the touch of cultural naffness (think Kenny Everett) which marked the Thatcher era. The \"international singing star\" at tomorrow night's conference gala dinner (tickets \u00a375, but you get a speech by Liam Fox) is Tony Hadley, former lead singer of Spandau Ballet. So by happy symmetry Gary Kemp, the brains behind the band, was a supporter of Red Wedge and Tony sings for Blue Wedge. \u2022 The Tories spent most of the first morning of their Birmingham conference praising their host city, its politics, its industry and diverse culture, and its football teams. This was odd, not least because the session's star speaker comes from Dewsbury. In the bad old days the mayor of a conference town, usually Brighton or Blackpool, got five minutes of glory in which to boost the town or insult his visitors. But the \"second city\" was allowed a couple of hours to pat its own back and shamelessly promote its candidates in key marginals. Even Birmingham City FC's MD, Karren Brady, turned up to say \"Come on, you Blues.\" However, the speaker who pressed the conference's hot buttons like a Yorkshire Sarah Palin was Lady Warsi, the shadow minister for community cohesion, a Muslim Punjabi solicitor from Dewsbury, and proud of it. \u2022 As the Tories regain their born-to-govern confidence there are more freebies at this week's conference than last week's. On arrival hacks who travelled to the US with Gordon Brown were given a canvas \"detox bag\" containing deodorant and Alka Seltzer. Later data memory sticks were handed out marked \"keep out of the hands of HM Government\". \u2022 The Conservative conference slogan is a clunky Plan for Change. Where did it come from? It was lifted from the Obama campaign apparently. They're quite shameless, these opposition politicians on a roll. \u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday September 30 2008. A reference to Spandau Ballet's Gary Kent should have been to Gary Kemp. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
