After the England coach Stuart Lancaster confirmed the rugby league convert would start at centre, Burgess was asked about a comment from Williams earlier this week in which he suggested he would find it easier to defend against him than the injured Jonathan Joseph. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d replied Burgess, who was effective as a substitute against Fiji and will now start at Twickenham only 10 months after switching codes. It was impossible to know whether Burgess was joking, genuinely did not know or had misheard. His inflection suggested the first of those. Either way, he soon became the target of ire for Welsh fans on social media. As his questioner explained, he added: \u201cOh yes. OK, yes. I\u2019ll just wait and see. I\u2019ll just let my performance do the talking on Saturday.\u201d Williams had been asked earlier this week whether he found it easier to defend against direct players like Burgess. \u201cI know which one is a lot harder to defend, Jonathan Joseph. I wouldn\u2019t say I prefer it but it\u2019s a bit different,\u201d he said. Asked about Burgess\u2019s comments, the Wales captain Sam Warburton offered up a diplomatic response. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Sam Burgess for that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I play against teams there are times when I don\u2019t know who each of the opposition are. I can\u2019t dictate what guys like Chris Robshaw are going to do on Saturday.\u201d Both Burgess and Lancaster insisted they had no concerns over the Bath player\u2019s lack of experience as he starts only his second international in place of Joseph. Lancaster has made four changes from last weekend, including the introduction of Owen Farrell for George Ford at No10. The new-look lineup is Lancaster\u2019s 14th centre pairing in four years. The coach admitted his decisions, which have been questioned by former players including Will Carling, had \u201cclearly\u201d heightened the stakes before two matches against Wales and Australia that could define his tenure. \u201cIf we win the game it will be judged a success, if we lose the game regardless of what selection I made, you\u2019d all be questioning the selection I\u2019d made,\u201d said Lancaster, whose contract runs until 2019. \u201cIt will come down ultimately to the next two games. I understand the consequences and the stakes because it\u2019s the World Cup.\u201d Lancaster has come under fire, first for selecting Burgess in his 31-man squad and now for giving him a starting berth, and for appearing to switch horses from Ford to Farrell. The Bath coach Mike Ford, George\u2019s father, has called the decision to drop his son \u201cmystifying\u201d. Lancaster said criticism came with the territory but called on all concerned to now get behind the team. \u201cI haven\u2019t been insulted at all. 100%, people are entitled to their opinion and I\u2019m not surprised as people care about an England team being successful.,\u201d he said. \u201cEqually people underestimate the trust we have in the players. We trust George and equally we have another guy who we have a lot of trust in and credit for what he\u2019s achieved. \u201cWhat would be good is if people got behind the selection. I appreciate there will always be debate and this is what happened in the 31-man training squad when that was announced. We need England behind this team \u2013 one to 23 \u2013 as it\u2019s massive.\u201d Lancaster insisted there was \u201cdefinitely no panic\u201d over his decision to drop Ford, who became a key man during the Six Nations campaign, in favour of Farrell after only one match. \u201cWe are fortunate to have two high quality players in that position. Since the Premiership final where Owen was man-of-the-match he has been pushing hard in training,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought he played very well in the first warm-up game against France and his contribution off the bench against Ireland was great. He has pushed George hard and it\u2019s the right time to start him in a big game like this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
