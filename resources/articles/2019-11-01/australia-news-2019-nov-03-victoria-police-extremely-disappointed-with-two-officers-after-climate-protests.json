The same officer who posted the memes, which included Pepe the frog, was criticised this week after he was photographed making a hand gesture that Victoria police deny was the \u201cwhite power\u201d symbol. Police have repeatedly stated the officer was directing an \u201care you OK\u201d sign at two protesters who appeared distressed outside the International Mining and Resources Conference in Melbourne. On Saturday, Victoria police said in a statement the officer had been reprimanded in relation to images posted on his personal Facebook page that are closely associated with online alt-right communities. The statement came after the images were discovered online. \u201cVictoria police is aware of the ongoing commentary about a police officer who made a hand gesture at the protest earlier this week and previous posts on his social media page. \u201cIn relation to the hand gesture, we have reviewed body worn camera footage of the incident and it\u2019s inconclusive. The footage does not capture both sides of the interaction and is at times obscured by structures and people. \u201cWe have spoken extensively to the officer in question and he has advised the hand gesture was simply the \u2018are you OK\u2019 sign directed at two protestors who looked distressed. \u201cIn regards to his social media page, we are aware of a small number of posts which include inappropriate memes. \u201cUnder no circumstances are these posts reflective of the values of Victoria police. The officer has been spoken to about these posts and, although they were made more than 12 months ago, he is aware of our extreme disappointment.\u201d Victoria police said it was assessing the material to decide if further action was required. \u201cWhile officers are entitled to have personal social media accounts, we do not want or expect them to be including content which may offend members of the community.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The second officer is also being investigated after he was photographed at the same protests during the week wearing a sticker on his body camera that said \u201cEAD hippy\u201d. The letters EAD commonly stand for \u201ceat a dick\u201d. Victoria police confirmed over the weekend the photograph of the officer was legitimate. \u201cWe have identified the police officer who was photographed at this week\u2019s protest with a comment on his body worn camera and can confirm the image is real,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are still working to ascertain how and why this comment was on his camera. \u201cThe community can be reassured this is not the type of behaviour we expect from our officers and we are extremely disappointed by the situation.\u201d \u201cVictoria police will be investigating the matter further with involvement from professional standards command and disciplinary action will be considered as part of this.\u201d Victoria police said the behaviour detracted from an \u201cotherwise professionally conducted operation and tarnishes the reputation of all of our officers\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
