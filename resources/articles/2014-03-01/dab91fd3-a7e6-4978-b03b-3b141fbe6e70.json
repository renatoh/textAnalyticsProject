Jim O'Neill, a former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management who is now heading an independent commission on the growth of UK cities, says the current plans to link London and Birmingham in phase one are likely to benefit the capital more than northern Britain as more people will simply head south to work. In an interview with the Observer, O'Neill says that rather than starting with construction of the London-Birmingham stretch \u2013 due to open in 2026 \u2013 it would make far more sense to begin by connecting Birmingham to less prosperous cities. Lines in this second phase of HS2 are not scheduled to open until 2033. Asked if the London-Birmingham scheme could have the reverse effect to that intended and draw more economic activity into the south-east and away from the Midlands and north, he said: \"Of course it could. You could certainly live in Birmingham and work in London when this happens. All this does is make it easier to get into London.\" \"In my judgment, for the national economy this is way more important than improving the speed of the link between London and any of these places,\" said O'Neill. \"I am somebody who has spent 30 years going up and down to Manchester, so I know from experience what that trip is like. I have seen in the past decade it go from three to two hours, and it is great, but it has not actually helped Manchester relative to London.\" O'Neill's commission, which is being hosted and run by the Royal Society of Arts and funded by, among others, the Local Government Association, Greater London authority and London councils, is looking at ways to boost the economies of cities across the UK as a way to increase national economic growth and ensure that London does not leave other parts of the country behind. He says there is a danger that the economic divide between London and other regions will widen to the point where the capital becomes an unaffordable no-go destination for the young. Parts of the capital were already \"not Britain\" because they are inhabited solely by very rich people from overseas, he said. O'Neill caused controversy recently by floating the idea that Liverpool and Manchester could build a closer relationship, merging into one metropolitan zone that could be called \"Manpool\". He welcomed plans spelled out by Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, and Jon Cruddas, head of the party's policy review, to devolve more power to the regions so that local authorities could plan their own services and develop infrastructure without relying on annual allocations from Westminster, which can be subject to unexpected cuts or variations. On Saturday Labour published a report as part of its policy review on the case for change in local government, based on work by a taskforce including Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, and Jules Pipe, the mayor of the London borough of Hackney. It calls for a thorough overhaul, with more solutions being funded, planned and delivered locally, and highlights examples of where public services that have been delivered and planned locally have proved more effective and efficient. O'Neill said that, if civic leaders in the north of England had been given a say over how to spend \u00a350bn, they would probably not have chosen a high-speed railway line to London. \"Instead of having a view of whether HS2 is good or not, if they could have their own pot of \u00a350bn to use in the most economical way, I have a strong suspicion that it wouldn't be a case of 'Oh yeah, let's do some fast train link to London'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
