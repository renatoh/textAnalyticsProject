Alex Proyas\u2019s bizarre fantasy of ancient Egypt is another such \u2013 or almost \u2013 flimsy contraption of digital crowd scenes, actors in singlets revealing pecs and thighs and very, very ridiculous ancient-Egyptian-god-type hats. It\u2019s initially fuelled with its own absurdity, like an ecologically unsafe type of diesel. But there is a falling off after half an hour or so. Geoffrey Rush is in it, playing the Sun God Ra, and on the arrival of a visitor at what appears to be his Fortress of Solitude in space, he says crisply: \u201cWhen a bird lands on my boat I kill it before it can shit\u201d \u2013 a skill he is not called upon to prove. Down in the mortal world, the treacherous god-king Set (Gerald Butler) usurps his brother Osiris (Bryan Brown) and rightful heir to the throne Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in front of a stunned crowd at the coronation, and begins an illegitimate rule. But cheeky young mortal Bek (Brenton Thwaites) may be the guy to restore Horus to his rightful place. The camera position occasionally reveals some Hobbity height-disparity between gods and humans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
