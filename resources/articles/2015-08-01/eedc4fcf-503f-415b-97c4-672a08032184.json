Reporters Without Borders (RWB) published an open letter to Carter on Tuesday in response to the Department of Defense\u2019s first Law of War Manual, which has provoked outrage among journalists for saying war reporters may be held liable for \u201cengaging in hostilities\u201d or \u201cspying, sabotage and similar acts behind enemy lines\u201d. \u201cThis terminology leaves too much room for interpretation, putting journalists in a dangerous position,\u201d Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Christophe Deloire wrote in the letter. \u201cLikening journalistic activity to spying is just the kind of ammunition certain repressive countries like Iran, Syria and China would seek out to support their practices of censorship and criminalization of journalists.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very threatening,\u201d Vanessa Gezari, managing editor at Columbia Journalism Review who has reported extensively on the war in Afghanistan, told the Guardian. \u201cI believe it contradicts at least the spirit of customary battlefield relationships, if not the letter.\u201d \u201cThe relationship between journalists and combatants has always been complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way the language about spying is placed in there is alarming to me in that it says, \u2018journalism is a lot like spying\u2019 and then it leaves that to people to make up their own mind. It gets at the commonalities but not the differences.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really quite disturbing,\u201d Frank Smyth, senior adviser for journalist security at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said. Both RWB and the CPJ estimate that the majority of journalists killed in 2014 died in war zones. \u201cIt\u2019s speculative, it\u2019s ambiguous, it\u2019s arbitrary,\u201d said Mickey Osterreicher, general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful at all.\u201d The editorial board at The New York Times echoed the criticism, deeming some of the manual\u2019s arguments \u201cludicrous\u201d. The 1,180-page document only vaguely describes when a journalist might be held liable without protections of either a soldier or a civilian. \u201cIn general, journalists are civilians,\u201d the manual reads, but \u201clike other civilians, civilian journalists who engage in hostilities against a State, may be punished by that State after a fair trial\u201d. The manual then says that simple \u201crelaying of information\u201d may constitute such an act. Army Lt Col Joe Sowers, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, said that such information relaying could include \u201cacting as an artillery spotter\u201d or as \u201ca guide or lookout for combatants\u201d. The phrase \u201cunprivileged belligerents\u201d appears to derive from \u201cunlawful combatants\u201d, a legal term used by the George W Bush administration to describe some prisoners taken on the battlefield. Sowers said the difference between terms is \u201clargely a stylistic one\u201d. \u201cReporting on military operations can be very similar to collecting intelligence or even spying,\u201d the manual continues. \u201cA journalist who acts as a spy may be subject to security measures and punished if captured.\u201d Smyth criticized the manual in particular for its many referential footnotes, which he says \u201cignore the most basic cases\u201d involving press freedoms and journalists. One such footnote quotes a 2000 review on the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia: \u201cWhether the media constitutes a legitimate target group is a debatable issue. \u201cIf the media is used to incite crimes, as in Rwanda, then it is a legitimate target. If it is merely disseminating propaganda to generate support for the war effort, it is not a legitimate target.\u201d The manual suggests journalists avoid spying accusations by gaining permission to report from \u201crelevant authorities\u201d, but does not provide guidelines about chaotic conflict zones such as central Mexico, Syria and northern Iraq, and eastern Ukraine, where factions have attacked and captured accredited journalists. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s been in a conflict zone knows that\u2019s not how conflict zones work,\u201d said Smyth, who was himself captured and accused of spying by Iraq during the Gulf war. The Pentagon also implies that reporters should submit all their relevant work for review and possible censorship, \u201cso that journalists do not reveal sensitive information to the enemy\u201d. Osterreicher and Smyth agreed that the language was overly broad, and said that the military and press have delayed reporting or kept major stories under wraps on request. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying there should be no limits to reporting,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cJournalists have a responsibility to the public and safety.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s always been that tension between reporting on things that the military might not want reported,\u201d Osterreicher said. \u201cThe military may complain that the reporting is too much but that\u2019s the inherent nature of journalism. It\u2019s gadfly of the government itself, and our forefathers recognized that.\u201d Sowers said that the Pentagon \u201csupports and respects the protections afforded to journalists under the law of war\u201d. The manual \u201cdoes not create new policy, nor is it directive in nature\u201d, he said, framing it as \u201ca resource on the laws of war primarily for the DoD legal community\u201d. He also disputed critics\u2019 characterization that the manual affords military commanders any special discretion, saying that the manual \u201cis not an authorization for any person to take any particular action related to journalists or anyone else\u201d. The manual includes a disclaimer about its limits. \u201cThe views in this manual do not necessarily reflect the views of those departments or the US government as a whole,\u201d the authors write in the preface. The disclaimer did little to allay Deloire\u2019s fears. \u201cEven if the authors of the manual have themselves disclaimed its legal value,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe nearly 2,000-page document still has the potential to influence the interpretation and application of the law to US military forces.\u201d The manual was issued by the office of Stephen Preston, then general counsel for the Pentagon and the former chief attorney for the CIA. Preston resigned in June after six years overseeing the Obama administration\u2019s legal policy with respect to drones, the raid on Osama bin Laden and the war against Isis in Iraq. The document\u2019s authors also note that they received commentary and advice from the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2013 the allies known with the US as the Five Eyes for the close coordination of their security agencies. During the Bush administration\u2019s war in Iraq the US military detained several Iraqi journalists, some of whom worked for established international news organizations like the AP, Reuters and AFP. All were released without charges, though Pulitzer-winning photographer Bilal Hussein was held for two years. Of more concern than US military action, critics of the manual say, is that authoritarian regimes \u2013 including not just countries like Russia but also US allies such as Egypt and economic bedfellows such as China \u2013 will use the manual as a justification to crack down further on journalists. Sowers said the Defense Department does not believe such regimes will use the manual, \u201cand that was certainly not our intent\u201d, although at least one Kremlin-owned news organization has reported on it. Sowers added that the Pentagon welcomes the criticism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
