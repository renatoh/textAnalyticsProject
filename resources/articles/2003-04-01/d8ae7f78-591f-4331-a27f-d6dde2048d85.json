I go straight to G2, cos I'm not interested in war. Well I am, but... Occasionally I buy one of the tabloids, if they've charmed me with a particular headline. But they're a guilty secret. Magazines: The only regular one is Uncut - I love music, and films. It treats musicians such as Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan as gods. And it has a nice free CD. I'll buy Sight and Sound - if it's got a free book or something. Anything with a free gift. Books: The last one was Four Letters of Love by Niall Williams - very nicely written. I've never been a reader of biographies, but I read a Bob Dylan biography and a Che Guevara. I like interview books with passionate people, such as Scorsese and Orson Welles. TV: I'm hooked on 24. Sometimes it's almost too intense to watch. I like Curb Your Enthusiasm, and documentaries about religion. I'm still a sucker for US shows - things such as Friends are consummate entertainment. No surprises, but well done. Radio: When I'm visiting my parents, I'll listen to Radio 2 or Radio 4. They don't have cable. When I was younger I used to listen to Radio 1 - I liked Chris Morris. Now it's aimed at 12-year-olds. Adverts: Generally, they infuriate me. I like adverts where they re-create accidents people have had, or where the guy who owns the company has forced them to put him in it. There was one at Christmas with a conga line of people going to DFS to the music of Follow the Leader. New media: I use the internet as a resource for trivia. A friend typed my name into IMDB, and apart from The Office, I also appeared in the 1992 Canadian thriller Killer Image. My character was called Kirk. Stephen Merchant was co-writer and co-director of The Office, and is co-host of a radio show on XFM at 1pm on Saturdays"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
