While indigenous people across California welcomed the long overdue statement, many had a similar response: now what? \ufeff\u201cAn apology is great, but what does it look like in terms of moving into action?\u201d said Morning Star Gali, a member of the Pit River tribe, in northern California. \u201cWe\u2019re still here. We\u2019re still fighting for recognition. We\u2019re fighting for the protection of our sacred places. We\u2019re fighting for visibility.\u201d Some Native American leaders and activists are now pushing for Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s apology to lead to a serious discussion about reparations for indigenous people. \ufeffEchoing the debate in Congress this week about reparations for black Americans, indigenous groups argue that government should compensate Native Americans for harms, some of which continue today. The state of California, indigenous leaders told the Guardian, should be looking at land and water rights, education, cultural revival, criminal justice and more. Returning stolen land Violence against Native Americans in California took place much more recently than in older American states on the east coast. In 1850, the state passed a law to remove Native Americans from their lands, separate children from their families, strip people of their cultures and languages, and create a system of indentured servitude, Newsom said. In the following decade, California\u2019s leaders organized and funded militia campaigns against indigenous people, creating what one historian recently called a \u201cstate-sponsored killing machine\u201d. Today, there are more than 100 federally recognized tribes in California \u2013 and many more that are unrecognized. More than 700,000 Native people live in the state. Restoring indigenous land rights would be one of the most direct and meaningful ways to right these wrongs, Native leaders said. \u201cThis is all stolen land \u2026 We are landless Indians in our own territory,\u201d said Corrina Gould, a spokesperson for the Confederated Villages of Lisjan/Ohlone, a tribe that originated in the region that is now the San Francisco Bay Area and is not federally recognized. \u201cThe only compensation for land is land,\u201d Gould added, quoting the Native author Winona LaDuke. \ufeffJavier I Kinney, executive director of the Yurok tribe, along the Klamath river in northern California, said there were roughly 1m acres of Yurok ancestral territory outside of the tribe\u2019s reservation land that the tribe would like to reacquire \u201cso that we will be made whole\u201d. \u201cTribes have really had the key to that knowledge of how to sustainably manage and be the stewards of lands,\u201d he added. Some said reparations should also mean supporting the tribes still fighting for water rights in southern California. Some local governments have recently returned land to indigenous owners, Morning Star Gali said, arguing that those processes should be replicated in the wake of the apology. In Sonoma County, known as California\u2019s wine country, officials agreed in 2015 to transfer nearly 700 acres of the Kashia Band of Pomo Indians\u2019 ancestral lands back to the tribe. \u201cThe day we took ownership was one of the most emotional experiences of my life,\u201d said the tribe\u2019s chairman, Reno Keoni Franklin, adding that California should now support similar efforts throughout the state. \u201cKashia created a blueprint to follow \u2026 a process that protects our sovereign rights and at the same time gives us back precious sites.\u201d Fixing education: \u2018Tell the truth\u2019 Tribal leaders also argued that school curricula should accurately depict California\u2019s genocidal legacy \u2013 instead of glossing over the violence. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, author of An Indigenous Peoples\u2019 History of the United States and a California State University professor emerita, argued that land seizures from Native tribes should be central to the US history curriculum.\u201cMake that a requirement,\u201d she said. Dallas Goldtooth, campaigner with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said Native people had long been \u201cerased from the narrative of California\u201d. \u201cCalifornia economically and politically wouldn\u2019t be where it is if it wasn\u2019t for the massive amount of land that was stolen,\u201d Goldtooth argued. Others said the role of the Catholic missions in the violence against Native communities should be taught. Many argued there should be a systematic effort to take down statues and monuments honoring those responsible for genocide, and that towns and schools named after violent settlers should be renamed. The state should instead resurrect monuments that make clear to residents and visitors that California was built on massacres \u2013 and that indigenous people continue to live on their lands here, they said. \u201cPeople come here from all parts of the world, not knowing Ohlone people still exist here,\u201d said Gould. And California should \u201cput their money where their mouth is\u201d, added Vincent Medina, of the Muwekma Ohlone tribe, saying he would like to see funding and resources to help \u201crevive our culture, which has been severely damaged from ongoing suppression by Americans\u201d. Seeking justice California should also address the mistreatment of Native people in the justice system, leaders said. California has one of the highest numbers of cases of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls among US regions. Native Americans are disproportionately locked up in the state\u2019s jails and prisons, and indigenous students are suspended at significantly higher rates than white students. In some parts of northern California, police continue to harass and mistreat Native people, Dunbar-Ortiz said. \u201cHow do you make this right? How can we heal this situation?\u201d asked Abby Abinanti, chief judge of the Yurok tribal court. \u201cThe wrongs are pretty complicated.\u201d The state should support indigenous communities\u2019 separate systems of justice, which, in sharp contrast to the US model of long-term punishment by incarceration, focus on repairing harm, Native leaders said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a system set up, and many people think that\u2019s the definition of justice,\u201d said Judge Abinanti, whose court uses alternative processes. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s a definition.\u201d Others said Newsom\u2019s apology should translate to better mental health services for Native people and stronger supports for communities dealing with alcoholism, drug addiction and other struggles rooted in intergenerational trauma. On Tuesday, Newsom told reporters that he hadn\u2019t yet considered financial reparations or other specific measures, but he did announce the creation of a Truth and Healing Council to \u201cprovide Native Americans a platform to clarify the historical record and work collaboratively with the state to begin the healing process\u201d. Goldtooth said he hoped Newsom\u2019s order would spark apologies and reckonings across the country \u2013 and a national conversation about reparations: \u201cWhat that looks like ultimately should be defined and led by Native people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
