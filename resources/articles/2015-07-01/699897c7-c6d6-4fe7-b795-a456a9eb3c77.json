The company\u2019s share price rallied 5.36% in after-hours trading. \u201cProduct initiatives we\u2019ve mentioned in previous calls haven\u2019t yet had meaningful impact on growing audience and participation,\u201d interim CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey said on a conference call with investors. \u201cThis is unacceptable, and we\u2019re not happy about it.\u201d Twitter is flirting with new features that will change its simple interface to curate tweets more effectively for new users. Its timeline layout, which places the freshest tweets first and is more or less synonymous with the product, may change. \u201cWe need to balance recency with relevance,\u201d Dorsey said. The company posted revenues of $502.4m for the period ending 30 June, compared with $312.2m one year earlier and a net loss of $137m. Stagnating growth, however, remains a problem, as does the vacancy in the chief executive\u2019s office. Average monthly users were up 15% year-over-year, to 316 million, but up only 8 million from 308m the quarter before \u2013 a rise of just 2.6%. User growth is a metric to which Twitter has paid particular attention, and it is not increasing at a rate that pleases company brass. Advertising accounted for fully $452m of that number and was up $175m from the same quarter in 2014. \u201cOur Q2 results show good progress in monetization, but we are not satisfied with our growth in audience,\u201d said Dorsey. The company is doubling down on its audience goals, casting stagnating subscriber growth as in part a PR problem (the company\u2019s head of communications left abruptly on 16 July). \u201cIn order to realize Twitter\u2019s full potential,\u201d Dorsey said, \u201cwe must improve in three key areas: ensure more disciplined execution, simplify our service to deliver Twitter\u2019s value faster, and better communicate that value.\u201d Ahead of Twitter\u2019s earnings announcement came the latest in a series of high-profile departures: product director Todd Jackson has left Twitter for Dropbox, and head of growth Christian Oestlien has left for YouTube. Dick Costolo announced he was leaving the company last month amid stalled growth, with Dorsey taking the helm on a temporary basis. Rich Greenfield, media and technology analyst at BTIG, said Twitter\u2019s focus on user numbers was the opposite of what it ought to do in order to stay healthy. \u201cWe believe Twitter has focused too hard on trying to be perceived by investors and brands as equivalent in scale/reach to Facebook,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors earlier Tuesday, about what he would do as hypothetical CEO of the company. \u201cWe believe spending less time trying to monetize syndication and more time building the active, logged-in user experience is a far bigger long-term opportunity. Too many people try Twitter and stop using it because it is too hard/complicated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
