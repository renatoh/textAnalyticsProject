Yet the surrounding boroughs include some of Britain's poorest communities. All seven bordering the City (Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Islington, Southwark, Lambeth, Camden and Westminster - the so-called \"City fringes\") - are among the 10% most deprived boroughs in England. Aware of the huge discrepancy in wealth and resources between this corner of the capital and what lies beyond, the City of London Corporation, the entity that runs London's financial district, has embarked on a campaign to buy locally to support small and medium-sized businesses. City of London officers are now required to invite at least one local supplier to quote for all contracts above \u00a3500 up to the EU thresholds of \u00a3144,371. To help departments find local suppliers, officers have access to an externally hosted supplier database that includes a high proportion of suppliers from the neighbouring boroughs. This attempt at local procurement will not be easy to pull off, as until recently the trend was towards bigger contracts. \"As a public body we're under pressure to cut procurement costs so the tendency has been to moved towards bigger contracts, which does not favour local suppliers,\" said Caroline Edwards, community affairs manager at the City of London Corporation. In 2002, the City spent \u00a3150m on goods and services, 22% of which was sourced locally, and the aim is to push that percentage up substantially. The potential benefits for local suppliers for this charity begins at home approach are substantial. \"If local sourcing captures a small percentage of the purchasing power of the City, we could drive huge economic benefit to these boroughs over the next five to ten years,\" said Michael Snyder, chairman of policy &amp; resources at the City of London. Apart from trying to target small firms directly, the City has inserted so-called community benefits clauses in its contracts with large companies which deliver services such as street cleaning, maintenance and catering. The clauses encourage big contractors to buy a percentage of goods and services from small and medium-sized companies based within the City of London's local procurement target boroughs. Large contractors currently supporting the buy local scheme in their work for the City include Inspace, a services company for social housing and Linbrooks, a building firm. Linbrooks itself is a beneficiary of the local procurement programme. Some years ago, the company, which has a turnover of \u00a345m, lost out on a contract for refurbishing and maintaining public buildings to a lower bidder. This year it bounced back by winning a five-year contract with the City. \"We would not have won on price but we won on service,\" said Tommy Thompson, special projects director of Linbrooks, who added that the fact that it was a local company helped. A big believer in helping other smaller local businesses, Mr Thompson, who also sits on the board of the Westminster Small and Minority Business Council, argues that there are lots of small companies in London that should be used. \"Why can't we use them?\" he said. \"If we don't we will drive local businesses out of business. We can't keep driving prices to rock bottom and get good services.\" Abba Litho, a local printing business in east London, has also benefited from the drive to buy local. The firm in Bow, with \u00a32.5m in annual sales and a workforce of 25m is a \"preferred supplier\" to the City and provides brochures and leaflets to the Barbican entertainment centre and the London Symphony Orchestra. \"Because we were local, we were given business,\" said Russell Watson, director of Abba Litho. The City of London Corporation now intends to promote local procurement among private firms by encouraging the financial services sector to develop its own local purchasing strategy. The idea for buying local came, like many so trends, from the US. The Houston Minority Business Council in Texas started by putting on seminars and networking events for large and small businesses and is now building data bases and systems to advertise and match up the needs of large and small businesses. How ironic that the US, such a forceful advocate for globalisation, is also home to its opposite, localisation. Now London is taking the idea on board. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
