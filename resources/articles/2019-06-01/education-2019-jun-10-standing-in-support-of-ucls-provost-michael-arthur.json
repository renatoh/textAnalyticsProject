As the article highlights, UCL is thriving in size. But, much more than this, it is thriving in research excellence, public contribution and global significance. It has risen to be one of the very best universities in the world, featuring among the top 10 universities across global league tables \u2013 a tremendous achievement for a public university. And Michael Arthur can take much credit for this. Steering a university of the size, complexity and prestige of UCL, with a \u00a31.5bn budget, is no mean feat. It is disappointing, therefore, that Peter Wilby appears to have based his entire article on the views of a small, anonymous portion of our large and diverse academic body. It must be added that Wilby\u2019s treatment of Tim Hunt\u2019s notorious sexist comments is remarkable for a newspaper committed to gender equity. None of us are perfect. But Michael Arthur is a man of integrity and hallmarks of his leadership have included commitments to increasing equality and diversity, improving the student experience, enhancing a neglected estate and to academic excellence. These values and successes deserved to be recognised.
