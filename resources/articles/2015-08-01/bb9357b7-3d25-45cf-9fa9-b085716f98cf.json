I imagine there was the feeling of something new and wonderful being created \u2013 not just for an elite with certain tastes and money, but for everyone. That\u2019s how I feel about the Museum of Old and New Art in Tasmania. Mona is my generation\u2019s Opera House. You may only go there once in your life (or not at all) but it\u2019s comforting to know that it\u2019s there (it\u2019s hard to miss, really, looking like an enormous hybrid cruise ship-submarine that\u2019s crashed into the cliffs along the Derwent). The fact that it\u2019s even there in the first place is a kind of service. It doesn\u2019t ask much of you except that you attend it with an open mind. Even then it doesn\u2019t really give a fig whether you do or don\u2019t. Yes, there\u2019s great food and brilliant art and the setting is incredible. It\u2019s arguably rescued Tasmania from decline and fall, and instigated a dramatic reversal of not only fortune but tone and mood. In its wake are new boutique hotels, mom and pop Airbnb operators, baristas, craft beer bars \u2013 all the accoutrements that accompany the cultural economy. It\u2019s the Guggenheim to Tasmania\u2019s Bilbao. But Mona is more than just an economic engine. It\u2019s a big, expensive art gamble by Tasmanian David Walsh that asks of us: \u201cCan you take something that encompasses a suicide bomber made of chocolate, a bacteria machine that simulates digestion (odours included) and a room full of televisions showing people performing karaoke; can you take something that you don\u2019t even like \u2013 that you find revolting or ugly \u2013 and still call it your own?\u201d The answer of course was yes. The big gamble paid off. Built without government assistance and costing $180m, the museum drew 600,000 visitors in its first 18 months, surpassing Walsh\u2019s expectations. On Thursday it was named in Lonely Planet\u2019s List of 500 Best Places in the World, as the world\u2019s best modern art gallery, beating New York\u2019s Moma and London\u2019s Tate Modern. In a lengthy New Yorker profile of Walsh by a fellow Tasmanian, Booker prize winner Richard Flanagan, Mona was described as being \u201clike a mashup of the lost city of Petra and a late night out in Berlin\u201d. It was the \u201cultimate senseless chance\u201d, Flanagan continued. \u201cWalsh wanted an anti-museum that challenged every shibboleth \u2013 anything, as he put it, \u2018that pisses off the academics\u2019.\u201d I love a Hermitage collection or the French impressionists that Australia\u2019s big state galleries bring out from the old countries as much as anyone. But Mona\u2019s beauty and swagger come from the fact that it doesn\u2019t curate a polite, culturally appropriate school-excursion-to-the-gallery experience. It\u2019s egalitarian and playful, it\u2019s a place of shallows and depths \u2013 just not where you expect to find them. There you are slack-jawed in wonder at a gorgeous piece of video art of a seagull, then less enthralled at a wall covered in vaginas, before being captivated but also bored by the Google word waterfall. At no point do you get the feeling that you should like this art, or at least appreciate it, and that if you don\u2019t appreciate it, there\u2019s something wrong with you. Philistine. When news emerged of Walsh\u2019s conflict with the Australian Taxation Office, there seemed to be a collective intake of breath. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that support was flooding in for the Mona founder, which is not something you read about often when you hear of gambling syndicate members in taxation disputes. There was a sense that Mona was not something we take for granted, that we want it to work and to live on because it says something about the nation we are becoming. For Flanagan, Mona is not the exception to but a continuation of Tasmania\u2019s DNA. \u201cTasmania is better understood as a place of extremes, radicalism and unreality, and Mona is merely its latest manifestation,\u201d he wrote in the New Yorker. Part of the Mona magic is that despite its solidity, despite our desire for it to live forever, it\u2019s as chimeric and as dreamlike as that late night out in Berlin. And like the gambler there\u2019s a sense that at any moment it could fold. The last time I went to Mona, I didn\u2019t even walk through its doors but had an experience that will stay with me for a long time. It was summer and rainy, about 4.30am. A friend picked me up from my hotel and we drove out on the highway, the only car on the road, looking for the turnoff to Mona. In the pre-dawn we found the James Turrell light sculpture, a structure, like a gazebo, that framed the sky. We lay on beanbags in the rain, with one or two other people sitting nearby, but obscured by the dark. Gradually dawn came, and we watched the sky change colour like a magic painting. There was no plaque nearby or guide to tell us what this artwork meant or how we should feel. And I still don\u2019t know what it means except that it was beautiful, and felt \u2013 with several of us lying on pink cushions, shivering in the cold pavilion \u2013 quite strange. Is Mona the best modern art gallery in the world? I\u2019m just happy that it\u2019s a question we can even ask: and for that, a big thank you to David Walsh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
