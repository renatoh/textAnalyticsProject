Save Bart's is one of the most enduring NHS campaign groups. In 1992, Bart's, or St Bartholomew's hospital in the City of London, was rarely out of the headlines. The Conservative health secretary, Virginia Bottomley, earmarked Bart's, founded in 1123, for closure in a shake-up of hospital services in London. With backing from medicine and City institutions, the Save Bart's Campaign (SBC) was born and generated a blizzard of stories across the world . The Sherlock Holmes Appreciation Society in Tokyo sent a \u00a3650 donation simply because Holmes met Dr Watson at Bart's. In 1997, Bart's was \"saved\" when the Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson, ordered its merger with the neighbouring Royal London hospital. SBC chair Wendy Mead says the campaign was considering winding itself up until earlier this year, when Bart's was threatened after the health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, deemed a proposed \u00a31bn private finance revamp of the two hospitals unaffordable. An affordable deal has now been signed but Mead says the campaign continues as a watchdog: \"We discussed a name change as so many people have said 'but you are saved'. Bart's is such a recognised 'brand' that we decided that it would be confusing to change our name. We have even been giving advice to other hospital campaigners, as hospital closures are back on the agenda.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
