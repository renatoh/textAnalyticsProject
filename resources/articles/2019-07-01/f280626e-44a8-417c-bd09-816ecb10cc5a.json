The 29-year-old was pictured in Paris on Sunday after a deal worth \u20ac32m (\u00a328.7m) was agreed at the end of last week, with Gueye now expected to sign a four-year contract with the option of an additional season at Parc des Princes. Everton\u2019s manager, Marco Silva, had hoped he could persuade the player signed from Aston Villa in 2016 for \u00a38m to stay at Goodison Park but it is understood Gueye was determined to move to PSG having seen a \u00a321.5m bid by Thomas Tuchel\u2019s side rejected in January. A product of the Diambars academy in his homeland, Gueye spent seven years at Lille before moving to the Premier League and helped Senegal reach the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Like Liverpool\u2019s Sadio Man\u00e9, he had been granted extra time off to prepare for the new season and is now expected to link up with PSG\u2019s squad later this week. Meanwhile Everton have reportedly seen a \u00a352m bid for Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha rejected, with the London club adamant the Ivorian will not be leaving Selhurst Park this summer. Zaha had previously been a target for Arsenal but their \u00a372m move for Lille\u2019s Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 has cooled their interest in the 26-year-old, with Silva\u2019s side emerging as his most likely suitors, even if they are unlikely to match Palace\u2019s \u00a380m valuation . Zaha signed a contract lasting until 2023 last summer and Palace are confident he will be at the club for the start of the season, although Roy Hodgson has admitted he is in the dark about the situation. \u201cMost of what\u2019s going on with Wilfried is going on between him and the chairman,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI can\u2019t enlighten you at all, I know what you know, I guess. I know it through reading on your websites or newspapers that this or that\u2019s happening.\u201d But the former England manager was prepared to admit he was disappointed in Palace\u2019s recruitment so far this summer, having added only the goalkeeper Stephen Henderson and forward Jordan Ayew after selling Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United for \u00a345m in June. \u201cI thought we were pretty much all on the same page, that we definitely need players, because our squad is very small. But I\u2019m afraid at the moment we\u2019re still there with the ones that started pre-season training,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cSporting director, Doug Freedman, and our chairman, Steve Parish, I know they are working hard to find the right people to bring in. I\u2019m confident that before the start of the season this squad will look bigger in terms of numbers and stronger in terms of the quality of player we bring in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
