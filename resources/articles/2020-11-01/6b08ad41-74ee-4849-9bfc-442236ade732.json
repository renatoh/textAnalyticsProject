The couple are pictured on a sofa in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, where they are spending lockdown. In perhaps a symbolic reference to their long marital union, the Queen chose to wear a chrysanthemum brooch, made from sapphires and diamonds set in platinum. She wore the same brooch in photographs taken on their honeymoon at Broadlands in Hampshire, and again in pictures taken to mark their diamond wedding in 2007. On their golden wedding anniversary she paid very personal tribute to Prince Philip in a speech at the Guildhall in London, in which she said: \u201cHe is someone who doesn\u2019t take easily to compliments, but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all this years.\u201d The royal couple has spent much time apart since Philip, now 99, retired from public engagements in 2017, with him living largely on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk while she remained at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. But during the pandemic lockdowns, the couple have been bubbled together at Windsor Castle. The colourful card, with a pop-out figure of 73, was one of several anniversary cards and letters send by well-wishers to the couple, with a small pile shown on a nearby table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
