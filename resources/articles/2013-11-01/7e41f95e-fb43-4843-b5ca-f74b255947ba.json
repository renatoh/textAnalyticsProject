With three players (David Boon, Greg Matthews and Craig McDermott) dropped as a result of Australia\u2019s innings defeat in the preceding Melbourne Test, the time was right to blood some new players. When the name \u2018Taylor\u2019 was called, most expected it to be of the Mark variety, with the exciting batsman and eventual Test captain waiting in the wings. At the insistence of fellow selector Greg Chappell, chairman Laurie Sawle called upon the decidedly less exciting off-spinner with only six first-class games to his name. The prevailing mood was one of befuddlement; Taylor had considered himself no certainty to even be picked in New South Wales\u2019s next Shield game. The decision caught the Australian media, not to mention the English tourists, off-guard and Taylor proceeded to claim eight wickets on debut in the fifth Test at Sydney. With the Ashes already settled in England\u2019s favour, Taylor claimed 6-78 in in the tourists first-innings 275 and a further two wickets in the second innings to go with 42 valuable runs of his own. Australia would win the dead rubber by 55 runs and Taylor claimed man-of-the-match honours in his first international outing. Though the noise that surrounded his selection and the whirlwind five days of Test action was \u201cemotionally draining\u201d for the newcomer, Taylor took international cricket in his stride and became a valuable contributor in the one-day area during a career that netted him 124 international wickets. By then Taylor\u2019s distinctive bowling action and modest \u201ccountry boy\u201d persona had made him a crowd favourite. 2) Kickett out, Wallis in When premierships and silverware are on the line, the hardest moment a coach faces is telling a player that they will be missing out on selection. No such instance created a bigger personal rift than that between Kevin Sheedy and Derek Kickett after the Bombers coach left the player out of the 1993 AFL grand final. A sublimely-skilled crowd favourite, Kickett had played every game of Essendon\u2019s 1992 and 1993 campaigns before being culled in favour of hard-nut utility Dean Wallis for the Premiership decider against Carlton. Sheedy has since said the decision to axe the versatile but out-of-form forward was influenced by his need to out-maneuver Blues coach David Parkin. Sheedy later admitted, \u201cI wanted to keep David guessing for as long as possible about the make-up of our side.\u201d Furious with his coach\u2019s decision to drop him, Kickett walked out on the club and finished his career with Sydney. He\u2019s never fully confronted the issue with Sheedy. The former Bombers coach conceded, \u201cAll these years on and Derek still hasn\u2019t forgiven me for making him one of the players who was left out. I have offered my apologies many times, but the last time I raised that old, open sore he still \u2018wasn\u2019t ready to talk\u2019\u201d. The men who had won a place in front of the shattered Kickett, Chris Daniher and Wallis, both made solid if unspectacular contributions in the 44-point win. A despondent Kickett didn\u2019t hang around for the Premiership celebrations. Despite Sheedy\u2019s attempts to reconcile with his former player, the coach has remained steadfast that the decision was the right one and vindicated by the unexpected triumph. He explained, \u201cAs coach, my job was to consider who was in form, who didn\u2019t deserve a game and who would benefit the team. A coach has to wear that.\u201d \u201cSometimes people think you are ruthless but you are doing your job.\u201d 3) The Mystery of Ronaldo at France \u201898 When the kick-off of the 1998 World Cup final came around and having stayed up all night in anticipation, I remember feeling sleepy and vaguely irritable. I was probably still in better shape than poor old Ronaldo, who\u2019d been selected in Brazil\u2019s side despite suffering a mysterious seizure only hours before the game. In the tumultuous aftermath of Brazil\u2019s 3-0 loss to France, a Brazilian lawyer began a civil action to force an explanation for what was basically being billed as a national disaster, while Rio\u2019s regional medical council brought an unsuccessful ethics case against the team\u2019s two medical staff. After initial roadblocks, an inquest by the Brazilian National Congress found that having returned from lunch on the day of the game with roommate Roberto Carlos, Ronaldo suffered a fit in which his entire body convulsed uncontrollably and the striker began to froth at the mouth. Open entering the room, team-mate Edmundo was a confronted by \u201ca really strong and shocking scene\u201d. Amazingly, having been prevented from swallowing his tongue by quick-thinking teammate Cesar Sampaio, Ronaldo eventually fell asleep, upon which team doctors advised his team-mates to pretend as though nothing had happened. Once awake and at the insistence of his teammate Leonardo, Ronaldo was informed of the incident and taken for tests to assess his chances of taking his place for the final. Arriving at the Stade de France with only 40 minutes until kick-off, the Brazil coach, Mario Zagallo, selected the star striker to take his place, but later admitted that the loss was less a consequence of Ronaldo\u2019s physical state but the \u201ccollective trauma, created by the atmosphere of what happened\u201d. Conspiracy theories still abound and include a variety of bribery and drug allegations. There was also the one claiming that team sponsor Nike forced the Brazilians to name Ronaldo in the starting line-up to extract maximum value from their significant endorsement expenses, but that was more or less dispelled by subsequent investigation. A more plausible explanation is that the Brazilian had a bad reaction to an injection to assist a nagging knee injury, administered as it was only 10 minutes before the seizure. Four years later in the 20002 World Cup final, Ronaldo and the Brazilians were at least able to bury some of their demons, triumphing 2-0 over Germany. Ronaldo scored both goals. 4) I\u2019d love to have a Beer with Warnie, \u2018cos Warnie\u2019s my mate Shane Warne performed many remarkable feats in his playing career, but for sheer audacity it\u2019s been his post-retirement skill for influencing national team selection that has both shocked and appalled, depending on which camp you sit in. With no disrespect to Warne\u2019s lobbying work to get fellow Victoria and St Kilda (Warne\u2019s club side) alumni Rob Quiney into the Test side, it was Warne\u2019s efforts to push spinner Michael Beer (also a St Kilda product) into the national side that was his coup de grace as unofficial selector. Amid a semi-serious national campaign to force Warne\u2019s own return to the Test arena (former team-mate Dean Jones had quipped, \u201cWarnie, without doubt, no joke, could actually come back\u201d), national selection chief Andrew Hilditch instead took his cues from the great leg-spinner\u2019s newspaper column and threw Beer into the fray for the third Ashes Test at Perth. The Victorian-bred spinner had only recently made the move across the Nullarbor to play for Western Australia and boasted moderate success on the Waca pitch in the lead-up. Not everyone was enthusiastic about Beer\u2019s prospects as Warne. Fellow retiree Stuart MacGill was incredulous: \u201cI am gobsmacked, shocked, I honestly cannot believe it.\u201d The former Australia spinner added: \u201cTo be honest, from Andrew Hilditch\u2019s comments, he doesn\u2019t even really know who Michael Beer is. He said he\u2019ll bowl well in Perth because it\u2019s his home ground. Look, Andrew Hilditch is a lovely bloke but someone needs to tell him Michael Beer has not spent his career playing at the Waca.\u201d Though Beer didn\u2019t make the eleven for Australia\u2019s win in the Perth Test, he eventually won a debut Test at Sydney, claiming 1-112 from 38 tidy but unremarkable overs as the tourists consigned the Aussies to a comprehensive innings defeat. Though he performed creditably in his second Test outing on the West Indies tour that followed, Beer now finds himself on the outer fringe of Australia\u2019s spin pecking order. 5) Moylan Major One of the enduring appeals of Major League baseball is that seemingly anyone can rise from the ranks of the minor leagues and have their moment in the sun. In the case of Aussie Peter Moylan, the bolt was more from outer space than the blue. Within a month of plying his trade for Blackburn in Melbourne, he was pitching for the Atlanta Braves in the MLB. The call-up came after Moylan\u2019s strong showing in Australia\u2019s 2006 World Baseball Classic campaign, where he struck out major league hitters, all of whom struggled with the unconventional \u2018slinging\u2019 action Moylan had developed in the wake of serious back surgery. Ironically, while the injuries forced the change in technique, it had the impact of improving his fast ball by 15 km/h. Baseball Victoria president called Moylan\u2019s action \u201ccontrollably wild\u201d. The married father promptly packed in his pharmaceutical sales job and relocated to baseball\u2019s homeland, starting a seven-year career with the Braves. After a brief stint with the LA Dodgers in 2013, Moylan is now a free agent and looking for a new baseball home. Parlaying his improvised pitching technique into near-on $4m in career earnings, his unconventional rise to the big leagues showed gave hope to journeyman pitches everywhere. As Moylan says himself, he\u2019s \u201cjust an Aussie bloke living the American dream\u201d. 6) Cook left boiling Though taekwondo is a sport that generally only sets the pulses of its competitors racing, the lead-up to the 2012 London Olympics saw the host nation\u2019s Games selection policy that became a national talking point. The world No1 and reigning European champion Aaron Cook was sensationally left off the Great Britain team in favour of his 59th ranked countryman Lutalo Muhammad. Speculation mounted that Cook had been ousted as a result of his decision to leave the national training camp and complete his Games preparation with his own private coaches. Reacting angrily to the decision, Cook\u2019s agent Jamie Cunningham blustered, \u201cIf the British world number one and reigning European champion does not compete, it will be a national disgrace.\u201d The shock decision left the 21 year-old considering legal action. Writing in The Telegraph Cook berated GB Taekwondo, claiming they were taking away his childhood dream to compete for a gold medal. Cook claimed his results were \u201cvastly superior to Lutalo\u2019s,\u201d before adding, \u201cI have been overlooked based on a subjective analysis of criteria not listed in the selection policy and due to British Taekwondo casting doubt on the world rankings\u2026\u201d In the end, GB Taekwondo held firm and Muhammad competed in place of the world No1. Cook has since switched his allegiances to the Isle of Man, calling the GB snub \u201cthe worst couple of months of my life, a complete nightmare\u201d. Explaining his defection he concluded, \u201cI\u2019ve been welcomed with open arms and I am proud to represent them. I\u2019ve made the right decision and there is no going back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
