I don't think it's real'", "bodyText": "At 16 Georgia Stanway upped sticks to pursue football. \u201c\u2018Not many people leave Barrow\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s said,\u201d says the forward. But that is what it took. And now, at 20, she is the youngest member of Phil Neville\u2019s squad for the World Cup. She is no shock inclusion nor is she along for the ride. Stanway is determined to feature and will likely get game time in France. \u201cEverything\u2019s happened in a short space of time and it\u2019s been hard for me to be able to manage my emotions because it\u2019s all just been a whirlwind,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to express how I feel because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s real. Sometimes I\u2019ve got to pinch myself that I\u2019m actually here and that I\u2019m going to compete for England at a World Cup,\u201d she adds while absentmindedly pinching the skin on her hand. \u201cI\u2019d love to play. I think that\u2019s definitely an aim for me. Obviously I\u2019m still young and I\u2019ve still got a lot of time on my hands and hopefully many more World Cups, but I\u2019d definitely love to play. \u201cI\u2019d love to make an impact in this group, whether it be a goal, whether it be coming off the bench, whether it be starting. I\u2019d love to get the opportunity to show what I can do on the world stage.\u201d She already has. In 2016 Stanway captained the under-17s to a European Championship bronze and last summer she scored six at the Under-20 World Cup as England picked up another third-place finish. Stanway exudes a confidence increasingly familiar in the new generation of young professional players. But while extremely glad for the opportunities she has been afforded thanks to the work over the years of the more senior players around her, she is keen to stress that struggle comes in all shapes and sizes. \u201cI\u2019ve played for Manchester City day-in day-out, whereas girls would have been training of an evening and grafting that way, and having a side job,\u201d says Stanway. \u201cI think I\u2019ve timed it perfectly in the sense that I\u2019ve come through when the league\u2019s been fully professional.\u201d However, being \u201cfrom a small town where there\u2019s not a lot going on\u201d meant her family had to shoulder a heavy load. \u201cIn order for me to achieve something I had to move out of there. But having to travel two hours each way three times a week put a lot of strain on the family and a lot of strain on us financially. I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it wasn\u2019t for my family. They basically gave up their lives for me to pursue my dreams. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to understand that everybody\u2019s got their own journey and everybody achieves it in different ways. It might look easy but mine wasn\u2019t easy. You never know what\u2019s behind the journey and what it takes to get there.\u201d Stanway was playing youth football with Blackburn Rovers in 2015 and, as England clinched bronze in Canada, she was sitting her GCSEs. Weeks after the Lionesses arrived home, she was signed by a Manchester City side one year into their reinvention. Her stock has continued to rise, culminating in a goal and player-of-the-match performance in City\u2019s 3-0 defeat of West Ham in the FA Cup final last month. The day before her Wembley bow Stanway went viral, having posted a photo of herself in a Rovers jumper queuing for half an hour for a photo with her idol Steph Houghton in 2014. Five years later she was walking out behind the City and England captain. She understands the effect that a strong England showing can have on girls\u2019 participation in sport. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be 10 times bigger than Canada \u2013 even the announcement got over 20 million interactions. That\u2019s even before the games have started. \u201cSo hopefully us doing well at the World Cup, us winning games, us showing who England are, us abiding by our values and showing the country what we\u2019re capable of will hopefully boost the support of people back home. If we can inspire one girl, that\u2019s enough but, if we can inspire 10,000, that\u2019s even better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
