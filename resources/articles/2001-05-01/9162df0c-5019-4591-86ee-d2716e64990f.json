Arsenal's Angela Banks, who claims normally to score only from inside the box, secured a 1-0 win at Bolton's Reebok stadium with a long-range shot just before half-time. Scotland will view the result as a sign of promise; England and most of the 3,004 crowd will have been disappointed. Although the England manager Hope Powell and her staff have been scouting the competition ahead of next month's European Championships in Germany, getting hold of a video of Scotland had proved tricky. Lack of media coverage of women's football means word of mouth is still an important factor in the game. The grapevine had it that Scotland, who play in Uefa's second tier of nations (those ranked 17 to 36) and have not beaten England since 1977, were not the pushover of old. Vera Pouw, their technical director since September 1998, is the force that has fuelled that improvement. You can see how Pouw impressed Craig Brown, who invited her to apply for the job. Holland's most capped international with 87 appearances - she retired to take the job - also works as a technical instructor for Uefa and Fifa, which is how Brown got to know her. When the Italian side Modena, with whom she played professionally in the 1988/89 season, finished sixth in the league, the five better placed teams all tried to sign her. Instead she returned to the Netherlands to commit herself to the national side's new \"intensive training programme\". The improvements she has instituted since taking over Scotland - such as new facilities at Livingston FC, special training camps and a scouting network - show she is adopting the same intensive approach with her young squad. \"Quite challenging\" is how the 22-year-old Scotland captain Michelle Barr describes Pouw's regime. Powell's squad would probably agree. \"I'm not surprised how difficult it was,\" she said afterwards. \"I know Vera's work. But I think [their strength] was probably a surprise for our players.\" Yesterday that strength and discipline was best embodied by the right-back Julie Smith, who confined the skilful Rachel Yankey to rare moments of danger. It might have been \"the best Scotland side\" Powell has seen but things will get even harder next month: England are grouped with Germany, Sweden and Russia. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
