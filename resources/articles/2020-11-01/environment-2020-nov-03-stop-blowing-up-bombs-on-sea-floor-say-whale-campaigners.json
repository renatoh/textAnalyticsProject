The offshore wind industry is expanding rapidly and this may lead to a sharp rise in such explosions as the seafloor is cleared before construction. A quieter \u201cburning\u201d technique is already available, say the campaigners. The seas around the UK are estimated to contain 100,000 tonnes of mines and bombs. They are relics of the second world war, as well as explosives lost accidentally or during training exercises. They are routinely disposed of using a counter charge placed next to the bomb to explode it, and there are an estimated 50 detonations a year. Marine mammals are sensitive to loud noises as they use their hearing to navigate and communicate. A 2015 study found that each explosion in Dutch waters deafened 15 porpoises, and possibly as many as 60. An alternative method, used by the Royal Navy since 2005, is far quieter and involves using a small charge to penetrate the bomb casing but without detonating it. The technique, called deflagration, causes the explosive inside the bomb to burn. Recent tests conducted by the National Physical Laboratory led its scientists to conclude: \u201cThe deflagration method shows considerable promise for noise abatement in [bomb] disposal.\u201d The campaign has been funded by Eodex, a company that provides deflagration services, It is voluntarily supported by a number of marine charities and the campaigner and actor Joanna Lumley. Underwater bomb disposal operations have caused the deaths of marine mammals. At least eight porpoises were deafened and died in August 2019 after explosions were used to clear second world war mines in a German marine protection zone in the Baltic Sea. Small charges had been used to try to scare the animals out of the area, but the porpoises remained in the strait during at least five of the 42 blasts, according to a government report. In 2011, at the Kyle of Durness in Scotland, 39 long-finned pilot whales became stranded in the bay at high tide, with 19 eventually dying. A government-funded report found nearby bomb disposal operations in the days leading up the tragedy were \u201cthe only external event with the potential to cause\u201d the whale strandings, although it could not rule out \u201cnavigational error\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have windfarms and green energy, but not at the cost of marine life,\u201d said Liz Sandeman, co-founder of the Marine Connection charity and a member of the government-sponsored Underwater Sound Forum. More than a dozen whale, dolphin and porpoise species can be seen in UK waters and already suffer harm from \u201cwall of death\u201d fishing nets and pollution. \u201cIt seems completely nuts to me that we are allowing these giant explosions to cause considerable harm to some of our most precious whale and dolphin species when there is a viable alternative available,\u201d said Lumley. In October, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged to quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030 so it can power every UK home. The UK\u2019s official conservation advisory body, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, said in June: \u201cThe scale of offshore wind installation planned over the next decades in some of these areas raises the potential for unprecedented disturbance.\u201d Developers clearing bombs already have to try to reduce the risk of harm by looking out for marine mammals ahead of explosions, and using scare charges, but the effectiveness of these measures is contested. \u201cIf you have a pod of whales under the water, you\u2019ve got no idea they\u2019re there,\u201d said Sandeman. \u201cBubble curtains\u201d are also used sometimes, but are designed to absorb the continuous, lower level noise from drilling the sea bed, rather than loud bangs, the campaigners said. A government spokesman said: \u201cWe recognise the impact that underwater noise from clearing unexploded ordnance can have on vulnerable marine species. We are working closely with the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), nature conservation bodies and marine industries to reduce underwater noise but must ensure any clearance method used is both safe and effective.\u201d He said the MMO, the marine regulator, could require the use of deflagration if it can be shown to be \u201c100% safe or effective\u201d. \u201cWe welcome the development of new technologies which can help to make [unexploded bombs] safe and reduce environmental impacts,\u201d said Luke Clark at RenewableUK, the wind industry trade body. \u201cDetonation is only used as a last resort if there is no other way to ensure the safety of our workers and operations.\u201d \u201cClimate change poses the greatest threat to our ocean habitats and wildlife, so it is vital that we rapidly develop solutions like offshore wind and that we do so in an environmentally sensitive way,\u201d said Clark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
