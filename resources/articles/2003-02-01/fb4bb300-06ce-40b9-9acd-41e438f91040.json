Zebrafish clue to cancer Scientists have genetically modified a fish in a bid to develop new treatments for cancer. Researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, have created a zebrafish modified to suffer the illness by fusing a leukaemia gene with a zebrafish gene which was then tagged with a third gene that causes diseased cells to glow. Scientists could then observe the cancer as it progressed through the fish's body. The group says it hopes the modified fish will help researchers pinpoint genes that accelerate or delay the spread of leukaemia. The zebrafish genome has been mapped by geneticists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
