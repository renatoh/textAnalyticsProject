When England took part in the second unofficial women\u2019s World Cup in Mexico in 1971, they played in front of crowds of 80,000 and 100,000. More staggeringly still, their squad included two 16-year-olds, a 15-year\u2011old and two 14-year-olds. In some ways the tournament was 50 years ahead of its time. But even as England\u2019s players were enjoying the greatest moment of their careers they knew it was an oasis. Two interviews with England players in 1971, dug up by the academics Claire and Keith Brewster in the latest issue of History in Sport, illustrate that bluntly. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be a professional footballer and play for my country,\u201d one tells the Mexican paper Excelsior. \u201cThey don\u2019t like women\u2019s football [in England]. Everyone criticises us. They think that football is for men and has nothing to do with us\u201d. The next interview is even more sad, with a 16-year\u2011old admitting that while her boyfriend had never opposed her taking up football he had been angry to learn that she would be competing for England in Mexico. \u201cThey had reached a compromise,\u201d the academics write. \u201cShe would give up the game at the end of the year.\u201d Just imagine it: your partner gets to represent her country and your first instinct is for your blood to boil and to choke her ambitions. Times are at last changing. Attitudes too. But we need to hear these stories, especially when the women\u2019s game is getting lift-off with record TV audiences in France, Britain, China and Australia in recent days \u2013 partly to appreciate how far we have come but also as a warning against the neanderthals who sneer about the quality of the matches, how uncompetitive the tournament is and incessantly whine about women\u2019s football being shown at all, as if we have tumbled back to the misogynist ages again. Most of these arguments can be picked apart with the ease of the USA team waltzing through Thailand\u2019s defence. Rubbish games? Guilty as charged, some of the time. But World Cups always have games that work as a slow-acting sleeping tablet. My favourite two World Cups, Spain 82 and Mexico 86, had many stinkers and shellackings \u2013 but several bone fide classics too. That is the nature of the beast. There have been some fine matches at this World Cup, particularly Australia\u2019s thrilling victory over Brazil. Uncompetitive matches? Sure, no one wants to see a 13-0 drubbing. But as Sophie Tomlinson, an analyst at the football consultancy 21st Club, points out, when World Cups expand that is what tends to happen at first. Eventually weaker teams catch up and make the tournament even more competitive. \u201cTeams finishing top of their groups are also dominating less than they used to,\u201d says Tomlinson. \u201cAnd the gap between the very best teams and the chasing pack \u2013 those teams that are looking to make the quarter-finals \u2013 is narrowing.\u201d The domestic game, too, is on the up. That is obvious not only in the standard of play, as reflected by English sides\u2019 performances in Europe, but in Opta\u2019s data for the Women\u2019s Super League. In the 2011-12 season, for instance, the pass accuracy across the league was 60%. Last season it was 72%. According to Opta, teams are now taking more shots per game (26.3 compared with 14.5), are more accurate with it (50% shooting accuracy in 2018-19 compared with 39% in 2011-12) and have a higher conversation rate (12% compared with 9%). But when it comes to altering attitudes within the game there is still some way to go. That much is clear from a 2015 study by three academics from Liverpool John Moores University who asked 10 women\u2019s coaches, four of whom were studying for Uefa A or B badges, for their experiences of the Football Association\u2019s coach education process. Sadly the responses were almost uniformly depressing. \u201cBecause I was a female he made me feel a bit silly and useless,\u201d said one. \u201cI was made to make a show of myself most of the time, which just killed my confidence. I was starting to ask myself: \u2018Why am I putting myself through this?\u2019\u201d Another said she \u201coverheard one of the lads say I\u2019d love to give her one, and then he made a humping action with one hand on the back of his neck and the other on his hips \u2026 But it\u2019s strange; there is a nothing you can do. You are made to feel as though you just have to accept it.\u201d A third said that what really wound her up was \u201cthat as soon as it was my turn to coach, all the men seemed to take it in turns to mess about. You know, mess things up on purpose. Make you look stupid. I don\u2019t know why the course tutors team allowed them to get away with it but they did.\u201d Yet we should be optimistic. One of the more interesting conversations I had following England\u2019s men in Porto was with a former Gillingham player who had a 10-year-old daughter that his mates promised was a future star. \u201cI\u2019m taking her to Le Havre to see England\u2019s women next week,\u201d he said, proudly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m actually more looking forward to that than being here.\u201d At least she will get the chance to shine, when in the past so many were shunned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
