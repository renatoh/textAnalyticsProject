Though perhaps too playful ever to be Oscar material, his performance as the Joker in Tim Burton's Batman secured the 52-year-old some lasting mainstream popularity; it made him a reputed $50 million; and, more than anything, allowed audiences to see clearly what had been lurking in Nicholson all along. As he switched on that sizzling menace and ghoul-faced grin, his most famous roles flashed before us: the devil-may-care liberation of Easy Rider, the zany leadership of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest , the violence of Chinatown , the swagger of Terms of Endearment, the crazed stare in The Shining. They all came together in a single cartoonish persona. Tim Burton said the Joker represented 'the darker side of freedom', and so, in a way, has Nicholson. Over the years, he has called himself a rebel and made himself a star - built an icon out of iconoclasm. Burton later confessed he was surprised by how readily Batman-buffs accepted Nicholson as the Joker, when the original skinny character was physically nothing like him. But that was exactly how the Nicholson alchemy worked: he didn't become the Joker, the Joker became him. By then, the more recognisable archetype of the two was Jack Nicholson himself. Yet in the past five years, Nicholson has reinvented himself. He won an Oscar for his portrayal of a curmudgeonly old codger in As Good As It Gets, played a detective hell-bent on revenge in Sean Penn's The Pledge, and has undergone an extraordinary transformation as Warren Schmidt, a retired insurance salesman from Nebraska - a role for which he has been nominated for a Golden Globe (the awards ceremony is tonight). About Schmidt, directed by Alexander Payne, the man behind Election, has earned Nicholson rave reviews in America, and the anecdotal certainty of an Oscar nomination, if not an Oscar win, this year. Already he holds a record - 11 nominations, three Academy Awards - and was the youngest person ever to be given a lifetime achievement award by the American Film Institute. Clearly, over the past 44 years, Nicholson has stood the test of time - but how? How does a 66-year-old symbol of sex and danger know what roles to choose? 'I hate being one of the older people in films,' Nicholson said some years ago. 'God, 50 brought me crashing to my knees.' And yet, he has made more of a success of it than most. Where is Nicholson going right? Colin Kennedy, editor of Empire magazine, says Nicholson has 'paved the way for how older people should be picking their roles - now Harrison Ford and Robert De Niro are starting to do indie stuff as well. I think Alexander Payne is certainly the kind of director he should be working with. You can add him to a list - Spike Jonze, David O Russell, Steven Soderbergh - of people who are doing the kind of interesting stuff that was going on in the Seventies.' As for Nicholson's age, Kennedy says that actors often do their best work later in life. 'John Wayne set the template for this - his best film work was when he accepted the age he was. In Red River he played older than he was, and he won the Oscar for True Grit, which was full of in-jokes about how decrepit he is. Actors, rather than actresses, tend to have the luxury of being able to do that.' Professor Leo Braudy, author of The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and its History, ponders the question of age in Hollywood. 'If you have a career in the public eye, one of the problems is how do you keep it going? And if you've been successful at a relatively young age, how do you keep that going? In the old days, stars just kept on going - Cary Grant looked pretty good well into the Sixties and Seventies. Jimmy Stewart kept that boyish look into advanced older age. Burt Lancaster never quite lost that physicality.' Nicholson, Braudy says, is saved by his unorthodoxy. He has 'never been a romantic lead - not in any conventional sense - unlike Warren Beatty.' Feminist film critic Molly Haskell agrees that Nicholson has fared better than Beatty, for example. 'The pretty boys have a harder time than somebody like Nicholson who's always played on that kind of scruffiness,' she says. Nevertheless, she finds elements of About Schmidt bothersome. Nicholson is cast opposite June Squibb, an actress his age who is made up to look as old as his mother. In fact, she plays his wife, a woman of whom Schmidt says: 'Sometimes I think, \"Who is this old woman who lives in my house?\"'. It gets one of the biggest laughs in the film. 'In all of his movies,' Haskell says, 'he legitimises sexism. That's part of the package. There's something obnoxious going on there, and people have called attention to it, but somehow he's so hip... he's managed to keep his anti-Hollywood credentials while remaining the ultimate Hollywood playboy.' His public life, perhaps, is the key to what Nicholson is or isn't allowed to do onscreen. Nicholson is famous for his relationships with women; for admitting he is not monogamous; for being open about his penchant for bachelor living, to the extent of housing his partner and children in a villa nearby. When he fell in love with Helen Hunt onscreen, people knew that he was the offscreen father of two children borne by a woman the same age as his eldest daughter. Nicholson is a rogue, whether you find him loveable or not. 'I'm still in love with all the women I ever loved,' Nicholson is fond of saying, a sentiment you can't help thinking must make things a little crowded. For decades, he has operated according to the self-invented maxim: 'You only lie to two people in your life: your girlfriend and the police.' In 1961, Nicholson married his only wife, Sandra Knight. They had a daughter, Jennifer, who made Nicholson a grandfather a few years ago when her son Sean was born. Nicholson and Knight split up after five years because, according to Nicholson's old friend Helena Kallianiotas, 'she fell in love with God and Jack couldn't compete'. In 1970, Nicholson had an affair with Susan Anspach, the actress with whom he has an onscreen affair in Five Easy Pieces, and she bore him a son, Caleb, about whom Nicholson reputedly didn't find out for four years. He offered to buy her a house and pay for Caleb's education if she would keep quiet. Her silence ended when a 1992 Vanity Fair article failed to mention Caleb as one of Nicholson's children. Anspach wrote a letter to the magazine, and a bitter legal battle with Nicholson ensued. In 1971, Nicholson embarked on a relationship with Michelle Phillips, of the Mamas and the Papas, who was then still officially married to Dennis Hopper. When Nicholson and Phillips split, she moved on to Warren Beatty. Shortly afterwards came Nicholson's longest relationship, with Anjelica Huston. That lasted for 17 years, until Nicholson arrived one day with the news that he had met Rebecca Broussard, a 28-year-old waitress at Kallioniotas's restaurant, and that Broussard was pregnant. Broussard was a friend of Nicholson's daughter Jennifer, though he says that was not how they were introduced. Huston turned up at Nicholson's Paramount office, where he was battling with his ill-fated film The Two Jakes, and beat him to shreds. Nicholson had two children with Broussard, Lorraine and Raymond, and after six years she left him for a man her own age. Nicholson dealt with the man he called 'that whippersnapper' and got her back. They have since split again, and Nicholson has been seen with, among other young actresses, Lara Flynn Boyle. 'Somehow, the older I get, the younger the women get who are interested in me,' he mused in 1998. The director Mike Nichols once explained Nicholson's success with women: 'All the rest of us were two guys: one, as it were, by day, and another when we were thinking about or near women. Jack is always the second one.' An explanation for this might be found in Nicholson's curious early life. He grew up in the beauty parlour owned by his mother Ethel in New Jersey. According to his sister Lorraine, the customers all 'thought he was the greatest'. And so a lifetime of being surrounded by admiring women began as it meant to go on. But not everything was as it seemed. When Nicholson was 37, a reporter for Time magazine found out that Ethel was not really Jack's mother. She was his grandmother. His mother was the person he had always known as his sister June; Lorraine was his aunt. June was only 17 when she gave birth to him, and the women saw no need to tell him the truth. When he was told, only Lorraine was alive to confirm the story, which she duly did. Nicholson has never resented their secret, preferring instead to believe that by saving face they saved his life, and he has never sought out his father. He once explained the situation to Vanity Fair : 'Sister. Sister-mother. Just hyphenate it and you know what I'm talking about,' he said, echoing the lines in Chinatown in which Faye Dunaway explains the seamier, incestuous situation she is in. 'She's my sister. She's my daughter,' she cries as Nicholson slaps her in an attempt to get the truth out. 'She's my sister and my daughter.' In fact, Nicholson has often said that his films are 'one long autobiography' - the reason he has no plans to write a memoir. With a little poetic - or comic - licence, you can well imagine many lines from his movies being written about the actor himself. In Five Easy Pieces, his character is criticised for abandoning his pregnant girlfriend: 'I can't say much for someone who'd leave a woman in a situation like that and feel easy about it.' 'I don't think he's overly psychotic,' a psychiatrist says of his character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 'but I still think he's quite sick.' Nicholson worked in Hollywood for 12 years before he made Easy Rider in 1969, a role he claims to have been given mainly to keep Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda from killing each other. Until then, he had worked for Roger Corman, making schlock horror movies. In the Sixties, he took part in LSD experiments at UCLA, during which time he claims to have re-experienced his own birth (though not, apparently, enough to correctly diagnose the facts of it). In 1977, he was scuffed by scandal when Roman Polanski was charged with drugging and raping a minor in Nicholson's house. This was eight years after the murder of Sharon Tate. In 1980 he played the murderer in The Shining, and based his performance on Charles Manson. Screenwriter Diane Johnson described the role she and Kubrick wrote for Nicholson: 'intelligent, unpleasant, mordant and sarcastic'. No one could have played it better. Not everyone is a fan of Nicholson's persona. 'I think there's a pretty close match between his values onscreen and his values offscreen,' says the film historian Mark Cousins. 'He strikes me as one of the most overrated actors. I always feel weary about him the way I would about a stag night. There's that smugness and sexual aggression, but no vulnerability. I wouldn't be able to say he's a bad actor, of course, but I think the values he personifies are very easy, conservative stuff.' And yet, it is precisely this, perhaps, that has made Jack Nicholson one of the richest actors in Hollywood. 'It's very clever what he has done,' Cousins says. 'He's planted himself in the ecology of Hollywood, where he's allowed to be sneering and lecherous and against the system, and they love him for it.' This is the secret of his success: he can continue to call himself 'an outlaw personality', while sitting at home on Mulholland Drive, collecting Picassos and Bonnards. His luck with women is unlikely to run out because, after all, he is undeniably charming. He has never lost what Pauline Kael described as 'that little bit of male fascism that makes him dangerous and hence attractive'. Or, as Shirley MacLaine more generously put it in Terms of Endearment : 'Who would have expected you ... to be a nice guy?' What Hollywood says about Jack Kim Basinger He's crazy, he's nasty, he knows life. He's the most highly sexed human being I ever met... he's just the devil. Anjelica Huston Can you imagine what it was like living with Jack when the phones were always ringing and scripts were always coming in for him and there were deals to be made constantly and I couldn't even get a job? Pauline Kael, critic Other actors might communicate a thought or an emotion with an economical gesture, but Nicholson does it with his whole body, as if he were electrically prodded, and, watching him, we're not sure if we're responding to the thought or emotion or to what a terrific turn he can do. Bob Rafelson, director Jack hasn't changed much over the years. He's maybe become a little more cynical and isolated. I've seen As Good As It Gets and I thought he was delightful in it. People ask whether the cock-eyed, slightly devilish thing in his films represents the real him? It doesn't even begin to represent how malevolent he is. Jack is much bigger in all respects than the characters he plays. He would never throw a dog down a disposal chute, as he does in As Good As It Gets - he would choke it to death right on the spot. Michael Ventura, screenwriter Nicholson a rebel? Give me a break. You want a rebel in the Hollywood system? Clint Eastwood is 10 times the rebel Nicholson is. Nicholson is the Hollywood system. \u00b7 About Schmidt opens on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
