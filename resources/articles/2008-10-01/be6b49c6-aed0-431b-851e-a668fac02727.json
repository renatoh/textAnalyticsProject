Even when a song's lyrics recalled happy times, it was chiefly because they had passed, or compared unfavourably with the present. I got to the point where a lovely, uplifting song like Dean Martin's Memories Are Made of This filled me with cynicism. To semi-quote Of Montreal, it's time my mood shifted back to good again, so let's have a (potentially at least) cheerier theme this week: comics and cartoon characters. The advantage of last week's atmosphere of introspection was the intimacy it inspired in the posts: there were lots of moving revelations about readers' families, and more detailed and brilliant justifications for the songs being suggested than usual. Or maybe I was just more affected by the justifications than usual; I certainly felt compelled to put Our Way to Fall on the A-list after reading steenbeck's lovely breakdown of its lyrics. Contrarily, gremlinfc's hilariously provocative post about Asian Dub Foundation made the idea of playlisting it irresistible. It can't always work this way, of course, but the thoughtfulness prompting such conversational posts is much appreciated and makes for a more absorbing blog. This week's B-list is even more influenced by the contents of posts recommending them, and everything on it slid out of the A-list reluctantly. It kicks off with Reflection's Eternal Memories, followed by Okkervil River's The War Criminal Rises and Speaks, Aimee Mann's Fifty Years After the Fair, the Magnetic Fields' extremely funny, alcohol-pickled The Night You Can't Remember, the Supremes' majestic Reflections, Harry Belafonte's Try to Remember, Matthew Jay's Remember This Feeling, REM's giddily beautiful You Are the Everything, the Cure's Pictures of You and Kyu Sakamoto's elegant Sukiyaki. No room, unfortunately, for the other 57 songs clamouring for listage, among them Boston's More Than a Feeling and Rolf Harris's Two Little Boys \u2013 guilty pleasures for me, if not the good people who nominated them. But I would like to make room for a few thanks: to ejaydee for the Trinikas and Mulatu Astatke, to frogprincess for Brooklyn Funk Essentials and to Favvy2000 for Camille, all much appreciated discoveries. I feel thoroughly ignorant for not knowing that Tina's version of I Can't Stand the Rain was a cover; thanks to steenbeck for leading me to Ann Peebles's sumptuous original. Finally, thanks to gordonimmel for Jethro Tull's The Way We Were; I can't truthfully say I relished the guitar solo, but very much enjoyed the song until that kicked in. Time to return to this week's theme, comics and cartoon characters. I think this one is reasonably self-explanatory, so apart from a plea not to force me to listen to songs sung by Daffy Duck (not that I know such things exist, but just in case), and a reminder that Laurie Anderson's O Superman has already been playlisted, I'll leave this one open. Deadline is midday Monday, and no post should contain more than one-third of a song's lyrics. The A-Z, RR archive and Overspill blog are down at the fancy-dress shop, arguing over the last Spiderman outfit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
