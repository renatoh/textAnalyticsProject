The embalmed corpse of the father of utilitarianism has vanished from its display case in University College London leaving only a card saying he has \"gone on holiday\". In fact, says the Philosophers' Magazine, Bentham has taken \"a well-deserved break in Germany\" and is on show at Essen's Ruhrland Museum after extensive restoration work. Bentham bequeathed his body to University College with instructions on how to turn it into an \"auto-icon\". Unfortunately the embalming process went wrong, leaving his head expressionless and \"decidedly unattractive\". Replaced by a wax replica, the mouldering original was left on the floor between his legs, from whence it is\"frequently stolen by marauding students from the rival King's College\". Recently, however, a new peril manifested itself: woolly bear beetle larvae were found in his clothes. Despite these indignities, rumour has it that Bentham regularly attends meetings of the college council. He is always recorded in the minutes as \"present but not voting\". \u00b7 In the Idler Louis Theroux visits Colin Wilson, now 70 and living in Cornwall. Theroux has been interested in Wilson since childhood and believes that \"whatever his foibles as a writer, his work deals with some of the most interesting areas of human life\". At 24 Wilson was heralded as a British Camus or Sartre on the publication of his classic book The Outsider (1956). He came up with the idea one Christmas alone in a London bedsit, and began writing it in his spare time at the British Museum. All of a sudden, the young man accustomed to sleeping on Hamptead Heath was \"Elvis Presley-famous\" and found himself at parties chatting to the likes of Stephen Spender, Cyril Connolly, and Iris Murdoch, who wanted to send him to university. \"She thought quite wrongly that what I needed was to train my mind,\" says Wilson. \"Obviously far from making me write better books, it would have crippled me.\" But fame is a fickle creature and existentialism went out of fashion. The critics were not so kind to his second book, Religion and the Rebel (\"they all leapt on it and stamped it on the floor\"), and Wilson's career took a nosedive. He has few regrets, however, apart from having turned down numerous sexual advances at literary parties. As Theroux observes, Wilson has an \"unshakeable commitment to his own muse\" which has allowed him to keep writing for 50 years in the wilderness \"without much in the way of mainstream acknowledgment and still less remuneration\". \"Sometimes you wake up in the morning,\" says Wilson, \"and you've written something brilliant the night before and you reread it and you think,'My God! I am a fucking genius!'\" IP"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
