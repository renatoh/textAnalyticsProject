And this time there is little wriggle room for Tony Blair, although the semblance of unreality - the promise from his friend Lord Falconer that the prime minister \"will serve a full third term\" - is maintained. Blair will ensure a smooth transition to Gordon Brown, well before that third term nears its end - or at least that appears to be the plan. Few MPs seriously believe that Brown or any other leadership hopefuls will have to wait much longer than six to 18 months. A smooth transition, the hope of most Labour MPs, might be at risk if this timetable is abandoned. An economic downturn would cost Brown, like Nigel Lawson before him, some of his lustre, and the planned coronation may become a bigger and bloodier competition, with Charles Clarke, Patricia Hewitt and John Reid seeking the crown. But now there are new voices, the most prominent being the Campaign Group MP Alan Simpson, who warns that the Titanic sank not because it failed to change captain, \"but because it failed to change direction\". From opposing ID cards to support for public ownership of railways, this 30-strong group is set to make a good deal of the running. So there is likely to be a leadership challenge from a re-energised Labour left determined not only to put its agenda on display, but also to ensure Blair's legacy is short-lived. The pivotal and politically streetwise union leader Derek Simpson, of Amicus, may be the one to watch for the nods and winks he gives in the coming months. Tony Woodley, Dave Prentis and Billy Hayes will be important too. For the remarkably quiescent union movement again gave its all to Labour's election campaign. The unions bit their collective tongue over Rover and the haemorrhage of manufacturing jobs. They did so because of the largely promissory Warwick accords that they negotiated with ministers last summer. Extending rights for working people has never been a priority for Blair - and one of the government's first actions on re-election was to try, unsuccessfully, to block European legislation introducing a 48-hour week. Not surprisingly the Warwick accords hardly figured in the Queen's speech. Surely, argue some, this is the time to begin a negotiating process with Brown that will give them - and much of the parliamentary party - the leader they desire and, more importantly, the political change they want. The chancellor is comfortable in a traditional Labour setting - from teenage Tribune seller outside Rosyth dockyard to thoughtful essayist in the seminal Red Paper and biographer of red Clydesider James Maxton, Brown's journey has been very different to Blair's. But what of the substance? Brown is as capable of delivering a peroration that is music to the ears of Bevan's heirs in the south Wales valleys as he is of delivering an encomium to entrepreneurs in the City. Brown's close circle of friends carries more weight and substance than Blair's. He seems unimpressed by the rich and the powerful, though his attentiveness to Rupert Murdoch's man on earth, Irwin Stelzer, and the Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, carry political health warnings. Yet there is a consistency to Brown. For years he campaigned against the scourge of mass unemployment and low pay. But Brown sometimes seems more comfortable with free-market America than social-model Europe. As a consequence, British workers work longer hours, are less productive and have less job security and fewer rights at work than their continental cousins. For the best part of two decades, Britain has limped by without an industrial policy, and more than a million skilled manufacturing jobs have been lost in the past six or seven years. So prime minister Brown is likely to be influenced by ideas that deliver the traditional goals of the Labour pioneers but by less orthodox means. \"Prudent Gordon\" may give way to \"pragmatic Gordon\". Labour's job will be to pull him towards European social democracy. He may even be given a steer by his more thoughtful US Democrat friends, who have abandoned Clinton-era \"triangulation\". Labour won a historic third term in spite of, not because of, Blair - a reality that still hasn't percolated through to some of the braying New Labour loyalists. Last week some of them shouted down colleagues at the first meeting of the parliamentary Labour party. \"It was reminiscent of the worst days of the Militant Tendency,\" reported one chastened MP. \"You could call it the Blairite Tendency. They are simply out of touch with reality.\" Change cannot come soon enough. Not only was Labour's share of the vote less than Neil Kinnock managed in 1992, but 40 or so MPs are highly vulnerable to small swings to the Lib Dems. Brown must know that a fourth term will be a mighty tough call. A change of leader and direction is what the public ordered. How long they are obliged to wait may ultimately decide Labour's fate at the next election. \u00b7 Mark Seddon is a member of Labour's national executive committee seddonzq1@aol.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
