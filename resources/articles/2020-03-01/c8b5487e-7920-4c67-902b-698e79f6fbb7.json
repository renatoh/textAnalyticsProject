The perils of home broadcasting in the Covid-19 crisis", "bodyText": "Susie Ferguson wakes up a luxurious 12 minutes later than usual \u2013 at 4.15am \u2013 and begins the seven-second commute to work, down the hallway to her home broadcasting studio, also known as the family office. At 6am she goes live from New Zealand\u2019s capital, Wellington \u2013 her children asleep in rooms nearby \u2013 to host the flagship morning news programme on Radio New Zealand (RNZ), the country\u2019s national public radio broadcaster. A four-week lockdown began on Wednesday night in an effort to prevent the further spread of Covid-19, meaning that almost all New Zealanders are required to stay home at all times and completely self-isolate. Although news media is considered an \u201cessential service\u201d \u2013 meaning reporters can still go to the office to do their jobs if necessary \u2013 many are opting to work from home. Ferguson \u2013 who had a rarely used direct line to Radio New Zealand\u2019s studios installed in her office years ago, when she became co-host of the Morning Report programme \u2013 is among them. \u201cThere\u2019s a slight sense of panic all the time \u2013 are the children about to start screaming or is the dog about to start barking? What\u2019s going to do the broadcast in this morning?\u201d she says. \u201cSo far that hasn\u2019t happened, but you never know.\u201d With a desk covered in overlapping white towels \u2013 so that her voice does not bounce off the hard surface, giving listeners the warmer feel of a broadcast studio \u2013 and hand-made signs posted around the house reminding her children, seven and 10, to be quiet, she starts the three-hour programme with one child asleep in the next room, about six metres away. Her husband is on high alert to prevent Ferguson being interrupted for questions about toothbrushes or breakfast. After the broadcast finishes, the pair help the children with their schoolwork; New Zealand\u2019s schools closed for at least a month on Monday. \u201cI kind of read them the riot act on Sunday night and said \u2018look, this has got to be able to work\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThey do understand this is really important, but I think as this becomes more normal, that\u2019s when there\u2019s going to be more danger of [interruptions] happening.\u201d \u2018Welcome to the beginning of a new normal\u2019 It is not her first unusual broadcast location. Ferguson has reported from Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, where she frequently covered her head in towels, duvets, and sleeping bags while recording audio in order to achieve a \u201cclean\u201d sound. But even for the veteran presenter, the situation is \u201codd\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit strange doing it here, which is why I made a little RNZ sign, so it makes it feel a little bit more like I\u2019m at work,\u201d she says. Her desk is decorated with encouraging figures \u2013 including two Funko Pop dolls. While her co-host Corin Dann, who is based in Wellington, admitted hosting the show last week in his track pants, Ferguson can take herself seriously only in her regular work clothes. \u201cThe only thing is I\u2019ve put some shoes on now but I was wearing some alpaca socks,\u201d she says. She has even built herself an \u201cergonomic\u201d work stand for her laptop out of a stack of magazines (covered in a sound-muffling towel, of course). \u201cWelcome to the beginning of a new normal,\u201d Ferguson told listeners after the eight o\u2019clock news on Tuesday. She understands that they want reassurance from her in unprecedented times. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of making it up as we go along,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople, I think, do want that comfort and reassurance as well as up-to-the-minute news and the latest on whatever the developments might be.\u201d Ferguson knows her listeners badly want something else, too: for a child or dog to breach the purple washing basket positioned as a warning just outside the office door. Numerous people have sent her Gifs and images from the infamous \u201cBBC Dad\u201d video, in which Korea expert Professor Robert Kelly\u2019s preschooler burst into his office during a live TV interview, followed closely by his baby and his wife. \u201cI do get the sense that people are intently waiting for the children to burst in and the dog to burst in,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cI am the BBC Dad right now. I\u2019m just waiting. The longer this goes on, the more terrified I\u2019m going to be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
