After Tory MP Peter Bone spotted that Liberal Democrat Tom Brake was flying tie-free, Bercow said: \u201cDo I think it\u2019s essential that a member wears a tie? No.\u201d This goes against Westminster\u2019s official line, which states that it\u2019s customary \u201cfor gentleman members to wear jackets and ties\u201d, and has led to complaints about parliament \u201cdumbing down\u201d. While I don\u2019t wholly agree that the fabric of civilisation has been torn asunder by the removal of strips of patterned cloth from the necks of male MPs, neither am I sure that the no-tie Commons revolution is a good idea. If MPs have a problem with putting ties on, shouldn\u2019t they just be told \u201cDiddums\u201d? The Commons is supposed to be an arena for official government business, not a school mufti day. While there\u2019s been some cheeky sartorial boundary-pushing in the past \u2013 one recalls Harriet Harman\u2019s \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like\u201d T-shirt \u2013 those were one-offs. Most pertinently, even if MPs don\u2019t like it, maybe they need the suit and tie combo to disguise what I presume is a dire lack of fashion sense. Taking a wild guess, I\u2019d say that most male MPs aren\u2019t exactly style warriors, knowing their Helmut Lang from their Christopher Kane, and, for them, like many men, the suit and tie is an easy uniform. Certainly, it doesn\u2019t bode well if the exiled Westminster tie is just the start. While some might argue that it\u2019s what a person says that counts, they might change their minds when MPs start rocking up for government votes in beach shorts, with a skateboard tucked under their arm, to go down to the park later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
