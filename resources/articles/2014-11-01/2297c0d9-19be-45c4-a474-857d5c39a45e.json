US district judge Brian Morris ruled on Wednesday that Montana\u2019s same-sex marriage ban is in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. Montana\u2019s ruling comes one day after the fourth US circuit court of appeals declined to block a ruling that struck down South Carolina\u2019s ban on gay marriages, clearing the way for South Carolina to become the 34th state that allows same-sex unions. Montana was the last remaining state under the jurisdiction of the ninth circuit court to uphold its ban after the court found that Idaho and Nevada\u2019s bans were unconstitutional, setting a precedent for the rest of the circuit. \u201cNo family wants to deprive its precious children of the chance to marry the loves of their lives,\u201d Morris wrote in his decision. \u201cMontana no longer can deprive plaintiffs and other same-sex couples of the chance to marry their loves.\u201d His ruling is effective immediately. A judge issued South Carolina\u2019s first legal same-sex marriage licenses on Wednesday, less than a day after a federal court tersely denied the state\u2019s appeal to delay the unions. The state attorney general, Republican Alan Wilson, has asked the US supreme court to intervene. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling by the fourth circuit does not end the constitutional obligation of this office to defend South Carolina law,\u201d Wilson said in a statement on Wednesday. Gay rights activists cheered the appellate court ruling. \u201cThe endgame is clear \u2013 marriage will soon be available for same-sex couples in South Carolina,\u201d said Beth Littrell, a senior attorney for the activist group Lambda Legal, in a statement. Some last-minute wrangling halted a Charleston County judge who began issuing licenses on Wednesday morning. South Carolina requires a 24-hour waiting period and a previous ruling had set noon on Thursday as the appointed moment when marriages could begin. But Charleston County probate judge Irvin Condon issued six licenses in total before court administration ordered him to stop. Condon\u2019s attorney had argued that a related ruling on Tuesday meant the judge could issue licenses to eligible couples who applied last month. Two plaintiffs against the state ban were among the first in line. Charleston councilwoman Colleen Condon said in a statement that she and her partner, Ann Nichols Bleckley, \u201care ecstatic\u201d about the ruling. \u201cWe knew going into this we weren\u2019t doing it for ourselves but doing it for us, my son and for all the other people who were afraid to take that step forward,\u201d Condon told local WCSC news. After the ruling, Bleckley said that she was \u201cthrilled for everyone \u2026 I do think it\u2019s a huge step for our state.\u201d Another couple, Kayla Bennett and Kristin Anderson, wed in a ceremony outside the probate court moments after receiving their license. Separately on Tuesday, district judge Michelle Childs ruled that South Carolina must recognize the same-sex marriage of a couple married in Washington DC. In her ruling, Childs found withholding such recognition to be unconstitutional. Although activists have celebrated the fall of bans in quick succession around the United States, one federal appeals court upheld four bans on same-sex marriage in November, increasingly the likelihood that the US supreme court would take up the issue again in the future. The justices have so far declined to rule definitively on whether bans violate the US constitution.
