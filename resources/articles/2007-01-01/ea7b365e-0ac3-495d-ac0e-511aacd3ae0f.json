Saitek is clearly one of the better manufacturers. Its wireless PC/iPod system - the iFreedom which I reviewed a couple of months ago - not only works in an innovative way, but also sounds good. The standard hasn't dropped on the rather lower tech A-100. It might be designed ostensibly as a partner for an iPod nano - it comes with a stand for the Apple player - but it can work with any portable device. Sure, it is an odd oval shape, but it delivers the sonic goods with a performance that is clear and underpinned by some real bass. There are, however, a few weak spots. It doesn't have an independent volume control, so you have to use the volume control of the device. And while it can be powered by either batteries or the mains, it doesn't come with a mains lead. Battery life isn't great, with the speaker system running for 12 hours on four AAA batteries before the sound fades. Nevertheless, this is a cute system that works well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
