Yet MacIntyre, who's reverted to the Mull Historical Society moniker after two albums under his own name, now professes to be equally influenced by metropolitan life. This record is dedicated to London, New York and Glasgow, the cities he finds most inspiring \u2013 the wordless closing track, Thameslink (London's Burning), even namechecks one of the capital's commuter rail lines. Nonetheless, City Awakenings marks no great shift in direction, other than a move away from quirkiness to the more conventional pop climes of the Lightning Seeds and the Raspberries. The 10 songs are mostly of a piece: sparkling and drenched in an optimism so pervasive that the occasional dip into self-doubt (eg, Fold-out City) is a useful respite. This isn't one for anyone who abhors tweeness, but its sweet nature helps to brighten bleak midwinter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
