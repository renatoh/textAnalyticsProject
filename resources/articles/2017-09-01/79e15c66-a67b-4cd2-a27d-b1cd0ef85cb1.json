Nevertheless their views were clear, before a landmark vote next month that could prohibit trust land from being used for trail hunting \u2013 where riders follow hounds in pursuit of a fox-based scent. \u201cWe would be very anti-hunting, to be honest, and very much in favour of the existing government ban on foxhunting,\u201d said Smith, a trust member who had travelled from Nottinghamshire to visit old houses and walk in the Peak District. The forthcoming poll has divided trust members and the annual meeting at which the vote will take place is likely to be stormy. Those behind the motion view trail hunting as a loophole to circumvent the 2004 ban on foxhunting, while campaign groups such as the League Against Cruel Sports claim that 10 years of monitoring show that hunts rarely lay a trail, foxes end up dead and horses \u201cride roughshod over valuable and often protected land\u201d. \u201cTo be honest I would be surprised if the trust let foxhunting happen on their land,\u201d Smith added, \u201calthough I have heard that once the hounds get the scent of a fox then there\u2019s no stopping them.\u201d For an organisation already mired in its fair share of other controversies \u2013 last month there was a row about staff wearing gay pride badges \u2013 the latest is something the trust could have done without. Asked whether hunting took place around Stoneywell, the property at the trust\u2019s Ulverscroft nature reserve, the poker-faced response from a tour guide was: \u201cFoxhunting is illegal.\u201d But trail hunts do take place. Joss Hanbury, the master of one of Britain\u2019s most prestigious hunts, the Quorn, said that riders used the land at least once a month and that an NT ban would \u201ctake quite a chunk\u201d of the land used by the hunt. \u201cOur National Trust area is relatively small in comparison to other hunts but it would have quite a big impact on one day a month,\u201d he said, while adding that northern hunts would be more affected. \u201cThe Fell hunts are the ones which would be really impacted and some of them would almost have to stop hunting probably.\u201d Hanbury was also critical of recent changes introduced by the National Trust to the way it licenses trail hunts. While the trust\u2019s board is calling on members to vote against the motion to stop trail hunting, the reforms include banning the use of animal-based scents for hounds or beagles to follow. The intention is to reduce the risk of foxes being chased accidentally. \u201cThe problem is that hounds have been bred for generations to hunt live prey, in our case foxes, and so it\u2019s difficult to retrain them to hunt something different because of their instincts,\u201d said Hanbury. \u201cThey will know the difference between an artificial scent and the real thing, so the closer we get to an animal scent we feel they are more likely to stay on that.\u201d The potential threat to hunting posed by the National Trust vote carries a particular significance for the Quorn hunt, which was founded in 1696 and takes its name from a Leicestershire village. The charity\u2019s president is Prince Charles, who once enjoyed hunting with Hanbury and the Quorn but no longer rides with them. Asked why, Hanbury pauses before replying: \u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t want me to say so but I think age comes into it. Also, he felt that he couldn\u2019t be political and continue hunting even if it was hunting within the law, and so he stopped.\u201d Would Charles have held strong views on the current controversy? \u201cI am sure he does but they are views that he cannot voice.\u201d In the local area there is no shortage of vocal hunt supporters in the affluent community of Woodhouse Eaves. One of the villagers, Diana van Nievelt, used to hunt herself. \u201cI remember going out with the hunt before the ban and it was never about bloodlust or wanting to kill foxes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when they were caught it was so quick.\u201d \u201cThe result now of that ending is that you will find people in the countryside here poisoning and trapping foxes in order to keep the population down, which means that they die a most miserable death.\u201d Nevertheless, even here the hunting fraternity has been on the defensive. Permission for the Quorn hunt to pass through the Outwoods \u2013 110 acres of ancient woodland near Woodhouse Eaves, which riders had used as a shortcut while trail hunting \u2013 was revoked last year following an intensive campaign. \u201cOpposition has always been strong in Loughborough and Leicester, but I think that things really have been changing in terms of how hunting is viewed even by people in the country villages and towns,\u201d said Christine Harris, a Labour councillor and animal rights activist who had been vice-chair of the woods management committee. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 35 years and when we have taken stalls to places like Oakham and even Melton, where they have the hunting museum, we have always had a good turnout. \u201cEastern Leicestershire might be a little bit different but even there you will find farmers who do not want hunting to take place, although some feel they cannot say so.\u201d Back in Woodhouse Eaves meanwhile, the differing views among National Trust members were illustrated by Sue Gyles, who had journeyed from Nottinghamshire with her friend Susan Sullivan to ramble through a forest trail. \u201cI would probably vote for the status quo,\u201d she said, when asked about her thoughts on whether hunts should be allowed to continue trail hunting on trust land. \u201cSome people will make a fuss out of anything and there has been a tendency for everything to have to be so PC these days. In fact, I remember coming across a hunt some time ago and the horses were all around us. It was lovely.\u201d That said, she chuckled at the very different view taken by another fellow trust member, her late husband: \u201cHe said that he didn\u2019t want to pay and it was because he was very opposed to hunting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
