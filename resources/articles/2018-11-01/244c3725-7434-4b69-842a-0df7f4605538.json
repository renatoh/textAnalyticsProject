Amazon got there in September. October was a fallow month for trillion-dollar statistics but here comes November\u2019s offering. The big five \u201cFaang\u201d companies \u2013 the other three initials provided by Facebook, Netflix and Google \u2013 have collectively shed $1tn in capitalisation from their high points this year. The sector has turned at spectacular speed. It\u2019s just a demonstration of the thrills and spills of investing in technology, it could be said. There\u2019s something in that idea, of course, since nobody owns these stocks for a dull life. Investors are betting on fabulous rates of earnings growth, projected many years into the future. It only takes a modest shift in the financial weather for valuation to be whacked. Yet tech stocks do not inhabit an entirely different investment universe. There are at least two reasons why the current tech rout may be signalling broader market worries. First, investors may be looking at 2019 and deciding that the only way is slower for the global economy. One engine \u2013 the US \u2013 has been running in overdrive this year as President Trump\u2019s tax cuts have fed into the system. That effect will fade and next year\u2019s story will be the pace at which the US Federal Reserve lifts interest rates. There is a risk of the Fed doing too much, too soon. Meanwhile, the other global driver \u2013 China \u2013 is spluttering. A growth rate of 6.5% looks good from a western perspective but is the slowest since the 2008 financial crisis. There is nothing that will obviously improve next year\u2019s outlook. That is partly because of the second factor \u2013 the US-China trade war. \u201cIf you want a short-term solution, there is no solution,\u201d said Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire in September, predicting 20 years of trade hostility. Investors didn\u2019t want to believe it, but they\u2019ve having to reassess. Hopes of a truce at this month\u2019s G20 are low and falling after US vice-president Mike Pence said at an Asia Pacific conference this week that the US \u201cwill not change course until China changes its ways\u201d. Meanwhile, China has launched a high-profile price-fixing investigation into three big computer chip makers, including one US firm. That affair may be unrelated, but it clearly doesn\u2019t make peace over intellectual property more likely. On current form, you\u2019d bet that the next round of US tariff hikes \u2013 scheduled for January \u2013 will happen. \u201cAll good things eventually come to an end,\u201d said Goldman Sachs\u2019 market analysts on Tuesday, striking a bearish tone in their predictions for 2019. \u201cCash will represent a competitive asset class to stocks for the first time in many years,\u201d the Wall Street bank said. That is eye-catching, as end-of-year forecasts are supposed to be, but it reflects the suddenly downbeat mood. If Apple can no longer shift more iPhones at higher prices, which is the micro worry about the tech sector, something big may have changed. Bumpy road ahead for Renault The reaction of senior Renault executives to the arrest of Carlos Ghosn was fascinating. \u201cOn your behalf, we would like to state here our full support for our chairman and CEO,\u201d wrote chief operating officer Thierry Bollor\u00e9 to staff, before stating that \u201cthe governance bodies are playing their full role in defending Groupe Renault\u2019s corporate interest\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to read between the lines. On the Renault side, they clearly don\u2019t trust the process by which Ghosn has been accused of under-reporting his income at Nissan and committing \u201cnumerous\u201d misdeeds. And they clearly suspect this affair will turn into a battle for control of a three-way corporate alliance that also contains Mitsubishi. One can understand Renault management\u2019s suspicions. Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa didn\u2019t wait to hear if Ghosn denies the fraud charges. Nor did he attempt to explain if Nissan, or its auditors, could have been complicit in any alleged wrongdoing. He just seemed anxious to condemn the \u201cnegative\u201d aspects of Ghosn\u2019s regime and ignore the obvious questions about lax governance at Nissan itself. If Renault\u2019s top brass smell a power grab, you couldn\u2019t blame them. Given the relative recent performance of the two companies, Renault, owner of 43% Nissan, desperately needs the partnership to hold. The FT\u2019s revelation on Tuesday that Ghosn had been planning a merger between Renault and Nissan before his arrest in Tokyo, and that Japanese firm\u2019s board was opposed, will only deepen tensions. Good luck to the French government, owner of 15% of Renault. This tale looks set to become very messy very quickly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
