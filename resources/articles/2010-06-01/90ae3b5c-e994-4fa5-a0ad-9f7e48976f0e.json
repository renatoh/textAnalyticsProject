While others who played in the same leagues in the Nairobi slums have gone on to fame and fortune in European football, Mutuli is about to join a very select group of financial risk experts. Later this year a great deal will be written about his homeland when two Kenyans take part in the Champions League. McDonald Mariga, who won a medal when Inter beat Bayern Munich in last month's final, will be joined by Dennis Oliech of Auxerre. Never before has Kenya, or any other country from East Africa, had two men at such an exalted level. There will be no fanfare for Mutuli when, by the end of the year, he qualifies as an actuary at Deloitte, for whom he works in London. It might not quite match the Champions League players' achievements but it is not bad, for the total number of Kenyans who have qualified as actuaries is, depending on whose figure you take, either two or four. Ever. There are, says Mutuli, who will return to Africa when he qualifies, \"3,000 to 4,000 working in the UK\". It has been quite a route for Mutuli, 33. From his early days in Mathare, one of the biggest and most deprived slums in Africa, via Oxford University, to the City. He owes much of his success to the Mathare Youth Sports Association (Mysa), a remarkable organisation that has been so successful since its inception 23 years ago that it has twice been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, in 2003 and 2004. According to Mysa, the largest self-help youth sports and community organisation in Africa, the slum area in which Moses grew up is home to more than half a million people. More than 350,000 of them are hardworking mothers and their children whose husbands and fathers died or abandoned them. They live in overcrowded shacks made of mud, sticks, cardboard and flattened tins. Mathare's makeshift homes lack water, electricity, toilets, rubbish collection and sewerage. Local residents say: \"When it rains the shacks leak, and water carries rubbish and human waste through our homes. Many kids get sick and die. Aids is also a serious threat.\" \"People I was friends with at school have died, been shot by police, turned to crime,\" says Mutuli, whose father died when he was 11, leaving behind a family of five boys and two girls. \"It was very hard for my mother. There was a lack of food, materials for study, electricity, water. Life was just about survival. There was a very big problem with self-esteem.\" Which is where football made such a difference. Mutuli remembers his first meeting with Bob Munro, the Canadian who was an environmental policy adviser for the United Nations before founding Mysa in 1987. \"We were playing footy when he came to watch us. We used a ball made from paperbacks \u2013 tear out the pages and make them into a ball \u2013 and Bob had a real adidas football. That was memorable.\" Mutuli, who was 10 at the time, became involved with Mysa and captained his team. In Mysa's many leagues \u2013 they now have 25,000 boys and girls playing in 16 separate competitions \u2013 teams are awarded points not just for winning, but for completing clean-up projects and other community work. Every team is a mobilised youth group, run by their own elected leaders. Tasks include persuading children to attend school; working to combat drug abuse and disease, and especially the spread of Aids; encouraging artistic talent; helping jailed children who have to survive appalling conditions; and much more. \"Being captain of my team, Huruma Flats, in the Mysa League, gave me confidence and self-esteem I wouldn't otherwise have had,\" says Mutuli. \"It was very important when I was interviewed for a Rhodes Scholarship. The interviewers kept on and on about Mathare, and what I'd got from football. That was a career-changing factor for me. I learned my life skills from football.\" He learned how to cope with failure. \"I wanted to be a big success at football and my chance came in 1992, when Mysa sent teams to Brazil, where we would meet Pel\u00e9 at an environmental summit, and Norway for sponsored international tours. There were three goalkeepers and I didn't make it for the Brazil trip, so I knew I'd be going to Norway instead. But I wasn't picked for that either, and I cried and cried. I had been rejected. But I had a long talk with my mother, she said maybe there were other means of travel (I'd never been on a plane or been anywhere) by studying. That was important to me, so I concentrated on maths. I was much better at it than others.\" He excelled at high school and university, worked for a Kenyan insurance company, then got the scholarship to Oxford and the job with Deloitte. \"I gained the confidence to do it from football. Football has definitely changed my life.\" Next week: Shunned and rejected because of his disability, the Zambian who has found a new life \u2013 making footballs"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
