In a letter to the Guardian, 40 leading cultural figures, which also includes Catastrophe writer and star Rob Delaney, Top Boy lead Ashley Walters and the band Clean Bandit, encourage people to vote Labour, writing that the Conservatives would create a more unequal and divided society. \u201cWe are shamed by extreme levels of inequality, neglect and environmental impoverishment resulting from decades of neoliberalism, in Britain and across the world,\u201d they said. \u201cWe are inspired by growing movements, from Chile to Lebanon and beyond, calling for dignity, accountability and economic justice. \u201cIn the UK, Labour\u2019s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\u201d Other signatories include Asif Kapadia, the director of Amy, philosopher Noam Chomsky, the playwright David Edgar and comedian and writer Alexei Sayle. Many of the signatories released personal statements endorsing Corbyn and Labour\u2019s manifesto ahead of next week\u2019s election. \u201cThe Labour manifesto recognises the crossroads we are at and has policies to help bring about this move to a life worth living for all. This is the fight of our lives. Make sure you are on the side of hope,\u201d said Sayle. Naomi Klein said: \u201cThe next government will hold power during fateful years on our planet\u2019s climate clock. There is only one leader who possesses both a path to victory and a bold plan on the scale of the crisis. That leader is Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Julie Christie said the voting records of Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have \u201calways been honourable: in favour of the disadvantaged and minorities and against war and exploitation\u201d. Rylance, who has campaigned with the Labour leaders on fair tax, justice and peace projects said Corbyn and McDonnell were experienced and progressive politicians that could make a significant difference to the UK. Michael Rosen, the poet and broadcaster, said: \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve got the economy back on track\u2019 means [the Conservatives] have balanced the spreadsheet. As \u2018the economy\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean real people, the phrase \u2018back on track\u2019 can mean NHS being cut to pieces, people on poverty wages, children hungry, schools cut, disabled people pushed into work.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
