But that bohemian folksiness is dated now, and the idea of selling a bride \u2013 though it never quite happens in the opera \u2013 is more than unsettling. Garsington Opera\u2019s season opens with a winning production by Paul Curran that moves the action from a 19th-century Czech village to 1950s England. The charm and folksiness survive even though there\u2019s not a Moravian knee boot, an embroidered headdress or a puffed sleeve in sight. Instead, the first act takes place in a village hall, the second in a pub and the third in the travelling circus. But in such an English setting it seems perverse to preserve the original language rather than perform a translation. Curran\u2019s staging, in Kevin Knight\u2019s busy naturalistic sets, is continuously assured and full of witty touches. At the start, the vicar puts an LP on his Dansette record player, cueing Smetana\u2019s scurrying overture. The drinking chorus in praise of beer leads to a stream of visits to the gents\u2019 loo. The heroine Ma\u0159enka dances the polka in a polka dot dress. And when the circus arrives at the beginning of act three, the acrobatic exuberance and tricks have an irresistible theatrical impact. Even Ma\u0159enka gamely celebrates with a cartwheel at the end. In the pit, Jac van Steen conducts the Philharmonia Orchestra idiomatically, and the Garsington Opera Chorus energetically swirl around the stage full of life. Minor roles are well characterised, notably Lara Marie M\u00fcller\u2019s pert Esmeralda. But it is the four principals in this opera\u2019s flowing sequence of duets and trios who ensure you don\u2019t want the music to stop. Pride of place goes to the touching and richly lyrical Ma\u0159enka of soprano Natalya Romaniw, a fine Mimi at English National Opera earlier in the season, who gets better with every role. Brenden Gunnell\u2019s Jen\u00edk can turn on the romantic tenor ardour, but his big voice succeeds in conveying his character\u2019s never fully resolved angrier side, too. Stuart Jackson\u2019s lighter tenor is touching as the decent but hapless and stuttering Va\u0161ek. And the bass Joshua Bloom brings splendid vocal panache to the wheeler-dealer marriage-broker Kecal. \u2022 At Garsington Opera at Wormsley, Stokenchurch, until 30 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
