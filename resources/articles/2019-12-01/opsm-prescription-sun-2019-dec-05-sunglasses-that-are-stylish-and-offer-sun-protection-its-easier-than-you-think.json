It\u2019s easier than you think", "bodyText": "Courtney Hancock spends copious amounts of time outdoors and in the water, and is well aware of the importance of protecting her eyes from the sun\u2019s harmful UV rays. So much so that she\u2019s fronting OPSM\u2019s Guard Your Eyes campaign alongside Bondi Rescue\u2019s Trent \u201cMaxi\u201d Maxwell this summer. Having grown up in the coastal town of Sawtell in New South Wales and now living on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Courtney has never been far from the beach. \u201cI\u2019m in the sun a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing in Queensland it\u2019s quite hot and the sun\u2019s always shining bright. I\u2019m in the pool at 5am until 7am, then I\u2019ll run for an hour or so, then again in the afternoon.\u201d When your profession involves being outdoors all day, sun protection is crucial, and this summer Courtney is on the hunt for the perfect prescription sunglasses. When function meets form Courtney admits that ticking the style box when it comes to eyewear is \u201cdefinitely high up\u201d on her agenda, but because she has a pterygium (an eye condition that can affect those who spend a significant amount of time in the sun) in her left eye, any sunglasses she chooses also have to offer maximum protection. This is something with which Peter Murphy, director of eyecare and community at Luxottica Australia and New Zealand, agrees. \u201cSunglasses are going to give you 100% UV cut-out - that\u2019s provided you purchase sunglasses that comply with the Australian standards,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other aspect of sunglasses is that they will provide protection not just for your eyes, but the sensitive skin and tissue around the eyes. We tend to think of slip, slop, slap and putting sunscreen on our face, but it\u2019s quite difficult to put sunscreen near your eyes, and that particular part of the face is quite sensitive. This is where sunglasses can help.\u201d To ensure she picks the right prescription sunglasses, Courtney first decides to have her eyes checked. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder that your eyes aren\u2019t always going to be this young, so you have to look after them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe optometrist said that I\u2019ve done a really great job looking after my pterygium, and it\u2019s not affecting anything at the moment, and [having prescription sunglasses] is also something that is going to really help it not get any worse.\u201d Murphy recommends having your eyes tested every two years, or annually if you\u2019re over 40. The test is important for checking the health of your eyes and detecting conditions such as glaucoma or macular degeneration, but also to ensure your prescription is up to date. Framing up the options Courtney\u2019s wish list included finding a pair of sunglasses for everyday wear, one for training and another \u201cfor fashion\u201d to cover every facet of her lifestyle. \u201cFinding what colour is going to suit me, and what style, mixing that all together, is probably something that I\u2019ve been, just, \u2018Oh, I like that\u2019, and I\u2019ll just grab those, instead of really going, \u2018OK, what\u2019s the best for me?\u2019 \u201cFor example, the best for me is having [frames that are] wrapped around the sides, so the sun can\u2019t peer in. I just never realised there were so many things that I really needed [when it comes to sunglasses].\u201d Courtney eventually settled on a sturdy pair of all-rounder Ray-Ban Wayfarers for daily use, a pair of wraparound Oakleys for when she\u2019s running and paddling (these, Murphy says, will provide the best protection from glare and UV light), and fashionable Prada sunglasses \u201cfor lunch with the girls\u201d. In the process she learned the value of polarised lenses, which are worth considering if you want to get the most from a pair of sunglasses. Murphy says: \u201cThey will give you protection from reflected glare, in particular if you\u2019re on the water, if you\u2019re sailing or down on the beach, even while driving or if you\u2019re on a ski slope. \u201cThe important thing is for sunglasses to give you good coverage so that UV light is not coming in, from the side. This is where an optical dispenser will certainly look at a person\u2019s face and make sure that the frame is fitting well.\u201d The verdict Courtney is pleased with the results. \u201cI\u2019ve got that balance now, where I love my sunglasses, and I know they\u2019re good for me,\u201d she says.
