All three countries expressed outrage that the work of the weapons inspectors had been cut short by the impending conflict. Despite insistence from Washington and London that France was to blame for the failure to secure a second resolution backing war, the harshest criticism came from Russia. The country's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, powerfully denounced the coming war, and said that no UN resolution had approved it. \"Not one of these decisions authorises the right to use force against Iraq outside the UN charter. Not one of them authorises violent overthrow of a sovereign state,\" he said. Mr Ivanov reminded the council that the Russian president, Vladamir Putin, had been the first to offer condolences to the US president, George Bush, after terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people in New York and Washington on September 11. He said that, if Russia had \"indisputable facts\" showing that Iraq posed a security threat to the US, it would take action \"without any hesitation\". However, he said, there were no such facts before Russia. The chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix, began the meeting by delivering his 12-step work programme to disarm Iraq through inspections. These steps, he said, would require active Iraqi cooperation. Mr Blix said that, although the regime in Baghdad had sent some letters to inspectors in recent days, UNMOVIC had been disappointed that they contained relatively little new information. He also said he felt \"sadness\" that the three and a half months of work in Iraq had not brought about enough reassurance to stave off war. The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said that his country \"emphatically rejects the coming war\". Mr Fischer added that inspections were successfully disarming Iraq and that, although Iraqi cooperation had been \"hesitant and slow\", this did not amount to a justification for war. \"The security council has not failed: we must counter that myth. The security council is not responsible for what is happening outside the United Nations,\" he said. The French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, said that war would only exacerbate the tensions in the Middle East that feed terrorism. \"To those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in Iraq, we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective,\" he said. Mr de Villepin also issued an oblique warning to the US about post-war Iraq, saying that no one country could rebuild it, and that only the UN had the legitimacy to take on such a task."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
