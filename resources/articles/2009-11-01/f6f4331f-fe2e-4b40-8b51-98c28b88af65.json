Certainly the note of morbidity lends faint interest to a film that's like spending an hour and a half inside an Argos catalogue. Swayze plays Wayne, long-suffering father to hormonal Danny (Cameron Bright, who had a bath with Nicole Kidman in Birth), bike-mad Brian, and cutie-pie Mary - big on giggles, mad for Santa, with a faint resemblance to Linda Blair. The smaller two go wild in the aisles of a shopping mall after they find a holdall of counterfeit cash mislaid by dopey conmen. Tim Curry co-stars as a Canadian mountie; Carmen Electra as an evil genius. Ahem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
