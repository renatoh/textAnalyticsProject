We suffered a bit in the first half but it\u2019s very important to be in the quarter-final. We conceded more chances than we expected in the first half, but they had nothing to lose and were taking a lot of risks. It was a massive game for us, it was very tough, but I feel very proud. \u201cIt was difficult but we started fantastic in the second half. I think in the end it\u2019s not too much to analyse, it\u2019s just to enjoy that we are in the quarter-final. Along with the Premier League it is the most important competition and we need to feel proud. It\u2019s about enjoying and trying to recover because on Saturday against Southampton it\u2019s going to be a big battle.\u201d David Hytner was at the Westfalenstadion to see Spurs advance to the Champions League quarter-finals with a nigh on perfect away performance. Post-match celebrations: Mauricio Pochettino hugs assorted players as they applaud their fans. Dortmund\u2019s fans continue to give their team their full backing. They played well tonight, up to the point where Harry Kane ended any realistic hopes they had of making up the first leg deficit. \u201cNow we can enjoy because it\u2019s a big achievement,\u201d says Hugo Lloris in an interview with BT Sport. \u201cWe want to keep on going, we don\u2019t want this to end.\u201d Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over - Tottenham are though to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, winning on the night after doing the lion\u2019s share of the damage to Borussia Dortmund at Wembley a few weeks ago. 90+1 min: Serge Aurier sends a cross towards the far post from the right flank, which Lamela part-handles and part-heads goalwards. Pulisic does enough to put him off. 89 min: Paco Alcacer is put clean through on goal courtesy of a wonderful pass into the Spurs penalty area by Jacob Bruun Larsen. Hugo Lloris is quick off his line to hunker down and block the striker\u2019s shot with his shins. Good save! Lloris\u2019s form has been patchy this season, but he\u2019s been outstanding tonight. 87 min: Axel Witsel hoists a cross into the Tottenham penalty area, but Davinson Sanchez hoofs the ball out for a throw-in. 85 min: Dortmund continue going through the motions, but they\u2019re a beaten docket. They deserve immense credit for their first half performance, but they must have been incredibly dispiriting for them to go in at the interval having failed to score at least one goal. The sucker-punch from Tottenham early in the second half was a real haymaker to the guts. 83 min: Tottenham substitution: Danny Rose on, Christian Eriksen off. His little legs have run 11.44km tonight, making 35 passes with 76% accuracy in the process. 79 min: Hats off to Dortmund\u2019s fans, who are continuing to get fully behind their tiring team, chanting, waving their flags and fully supporting a totally lost cause. Moussa Sissoko scuttles into the Dortmund penalty area and goes to ground while trying to pick out Kane. Dortmund clear. Somebody\u2019s on form tonight! This, in response to a four-minute delay in the Real Madrid Ajax game while the referee dithered over a decision that shouldn\u2019t actually have been have gone to VAR in the first place. 76 min: Just on for Marco Reus, Thomas Delaney sends the ball into the Spurs penalty area, where an unmarked Christian Pulisic stretches every sinew before heading high over the bar. He should have done better. 73 min: It\u2019s a good night for Tottenham and yet in so many ways it\u2019s a very, very bad night for Tottenham. Real Madrid\u2019s imminent exit from the Champions League at the hands of Ajax will surely rule out any small chance their manager Santiago Soilari had of keeping his job for next season. And who do we think it is that Real president Florentino Perez has his beady on with a view to replacing him? Give yourself a gold star if you answered Mauricio Pochettino. 72 min: Tottenham go forward, with Moussa Sissoko trying to tee up Kane on the edge of the Dortmund penalty area. He runs into traffic and the home side clear their lines. 70 min: Tottenham substitution: Erik Lamela on for Son, who\u2019s had another good game for Tottenham. He\u2019s one booking away from a suspension and would miss the first leg of his side\u2019s quarter-final if he were to have his name taken tonight. He walks off the pitch and gets a warm embrace from his manager. 66 min: The Dortmund rabble huffing and puffing around the pitch in this second half is unrecognisable from the energetic young go-getters that relentlessly peppered the Tottenham goal to no avail in the first period. Stick a fork in them, they\u2019re done. 65 min: Far be it from me to put anyone off reading this minute-by-minte report, but if the roars and excited chatter going on around me in the office is anything to go by, you might want to drop in on Paul Doyle\u2019s minute-by-minute report on the match between Real Madrid and Ajax at the Bernabeu. 61 min: Dortmund double-substitution: Jacob Bruun Larsen and Christian Pulisic on for Marcus Wolf and Raphael Guirreiro. Both men run on to the pitch looking full of vim and vigour as they point at various people and places. Dortmund switch to three at the back. To Twitter: My colleague Barney Ronay has gone on a fishing expedition. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how many bites he gets. 58 min: That Tottenham goal really seems to have knocked the stuffing out of Dortmund, who will be sickened to be one down after the gubbing they gave their opponents in the first half. With their hosts visibly deflating, it would come as no great surprise to see Spurs go on to score another couple of goals. One thing\u2019s for certain - Dortmund aren\u2019t going to score the five they need to go through to the quarter-finals. 57 min: That sweet strike from Harry Kane makes him Tottenham\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer in Europe. He\u2019s on 24, with Jermain Defoe just behind him on 23. Martin Chivers is third on 22 and Mark Falco and Alan Gilzean are next best on 13 each. 55 min: Tottenham substitution: Harry Winks goes down injured and signals to the bench that he\u2019ll need to go off. I suspect that could be a repeat of the injury that threatened to keep him out of this game in the first place. He\u2019s replaced by Eric Dier, whose been sidelined recently with a bout of tonsillitis. 54 min: Dortmund will be furious with themselves for conceding that goal as it was easily avoidable. Kane was completely unmarked by either central defender as he received the through-ball from Sissoko, who was also in acres of space. VAR is great, innit? Despite Kane timing his run to perfection, Tottenham\u2019s celebrations are curtailed as the referee consults with his VAR to establish that there was no offside in the build-up to the goal. This elimination of anything resembling spontaneity and fun from the sport is a real step in the right direction for the kind of people who value Getting Every Little Thing Right over actual entertainment. Tottenham score!!! Kane comes from an offside position to get onside, split the two central defenders and latch on to a through-ball from Sissoko. He curls the ball past Roman Burki and inside the near post from about 15 yards out to put his side 4-0 up on aggregate with an away goal in the bank to boot. 48 min: Tottenham advance into Dortmund territory, but Eriksen gives the ball away to Axel Witsel. 46 min: Dortmund are immediately on the attack, with Alcacer lifting the ball over the top for Reus cantering down the inside right. He lashes the ball low and hard across the face of goal, but there\u2019s nobody on hand to poke it home. Guerreiro was sprinting forward, but couldn\u2019t get in position. 46 min: Dortmund get the ball rolling with no changes in personnel on either side. An email from J\u00f6rn Gillys-Niemeyer: \u201cYou write about the 25,000 supporters in the S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne,\u201d he says. \u201cA common mistake and therefore worth correcting. As Champions League only allows seating tickets the 25,000 standing area is converted to a 11.000 seating area. The real yellow wall is only up for Bundesliga and German Cup matches.\u201d That\u2019s me told. The players go in at the break with the deadlock unbroken in this second leg. Dortmund dominated from the get-go and it\u2019s quite remarkable that they didn\u2019t score. They\u2019ve had several excellent chances, but some impressive defending and a few excellent saves from Lloris have kept them from jolting the scoreboard operator into action. Tottenham have had one decent scoring opportunity, with Son being played through on goal by Eriksen, only to shoot wide of the upright after being pushed in the back by Wolf. 45+2 min: Axel Witsel tries to play Marco Reus in behind, but completely overcooks his pass and the ball runs through to Hugo Lloris. 45+2 min: Moussa Sissoko gallops back towards his own goal before winning the ball from Jadon Sancho as the young Englishmen was sprinting upfield on the counter-attack. 45 min: More time-wasting from Tottenham as they dawdle over another throw-in before winning themselves a corner. Eriksen clips the ball towards the near post, where it\u2019s headed clear by Marco Reus. 44 min: Alcacer tries his luck from distance, but his curling effort towards the bottom left-hand corner doesn\u2019t trouble Lloris unduly. 43 min: The clock ticks towards half-time and if Spurs can get back to their dressing-room without having conceded a goal, they\u2019ll be counting their blessings. They\u2019ve weathered quite the storm thus far, with Hugo Lloris making five saves, Ben Davies clearing one off the line and Jan Vertonghen saving what looked a certain goal with a brilliantly timed tackle. 41 min: Dortmund win a free-kick wide on the left, a long way out. The ball\u2019s lofted towards the Spurs penalty area by Jadon Sancho, where Davinson Sanchez heads clear. 39 min: Looking at that Wolf shove on Son again, I can\u2019t see how the VAR and/or the referee could have come to any other conclusion than that Wolf clearly pushed Son in the back as he was about to shoot when clean through on goal. It would have been a penalty, a red card and \u2013 almost certainly \u2013 tie over. 38 min: More frantic defending from Tottenham, who are really under the cosh. Wolf gets in behind down the right and drills a low cross into the area. His delivery is put out for a corner from which nothing comes. 37 min: Another save from Lloris, this time from a Sancho shot straight at him from just inside the penalty area. 34 min: Dortmund go close three times in quick succession. Lloris saves brilliantly with an outstretched left hand from Goetze moments after he and Ben Davies had combined to save from Wiegl and Reus. Davies did superbly at one post to deflect a goalbound Reus shot over the bar for the corner from which Goetz came so close to scoring. 33 min: According to BT Sport\u2019s in-house referee Peter Walton, Son was onside. He doesn\u2019t think there was enough conclusive evidence of a shove in the back from Wolf for the referee to have awarded a penalty if the Video Assistant Referee had intervened. 30 min: Chance! Whatever Poch said to Son almost did the trick. The South Korean was put in behind Marius Wolf by a deft pass from Eriksen. Through on goal with Wolf in hot pursuit, he shoots wide with his right foot, having shipped a push in the back from his pursuer just before pulling the trigger. I have a feeling Son was offside and the linesman was waiting to see how the move would pan out before raising his flag. 27 min: Serge Aurier further enrages the Dortmund crowd, going down and staying down after a challenge from Abdou Diallo. While he receives treatment, Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen give the referee some helpful and no doubt unsolicited advice. On the touchline Mauricio Pochettino gives Son Heung-min a pep-talk. 25 min: Tottenham win a throw-in just inside the Dortmund half and the crowd roar impatiently as Serge Aurier dawdles over taking it, while stealing about 10 yards in the process. Referee Danny Makkelie blows his whistle and give the throw-in the other way, prompting Moussa Sissoko to kick the ball away in a fit of pique. The Tottenham midfielder escapes a booking for his petulance. 23 min: Abdou Diallou makes inroads down the left flank and tees up Mario Goetze for a shot on goal from the edge of the penalty area. It\u2019s a weak effort and is blocked. Diallou had a couple of better passing options open to him there, but elected to pick out Goetze. 22 min: A quarter of the way into the game and the deadline remains unbroken, which will suit Tottenham just fine. 21 min: Chance! Marco Reus finds a pocket of space just inside the Spurs penalty area, picks up a pull-back from Guerreiro and lashes the ball goalwards. His shot takes a deflection off Davinson Sanchez and loops up into the arms of Hugo Lloris. 19 min: Ben Davies lashes a cross in from the left, aiming for Harry Kane on the edge of the Dortmund penalty area. It\u2019s not quite accurate enough and Dortmund clear their lines. 18 min: Possession stats so far: Dortmund 73%-27% Tottenham Hotspur. 16 min: The ball\u2019s played wide to Abdou Diallo on the left wing and he trades passes with Axel Witsel, before the Belgian floats the ball over the top for Paco Alcacer. Playing on the shoulder of Davinson Sanchez, he gets in front of his man, sticks out a leg and hooks the dropping ball over both Hugo Lloris and the cross-bar. He\u2019s flagged for offside. 14 min: Dortmund continue to dominate, penning Spurs back as they look for an opening and the early goal that would surely put a spring in their step. 13 min: Eriksen hacks the ball clear as a low cross is drilled towards Alcacer at the near post. 11 min: Jan Vertonghen slides in to dispossess Reus with a fantastic, goal-saving tackle on the edge of the Tottenham six yard box as the Dortmund man was shaping to shoot from close range after bursting into the penalty area. 10 min: Good defending from Alderweireld, who doesn\u2019t allow Jadon Sancho to get a cross into the Tottenham penalty area, when several of his team-mates were in good positions. He slices the ball wide. 9 min: Dortmund play the ball long for Reus to chase, but again it\u2019s over-cooked and sails out of play for a Tottenham throw-in deep inside their own half. 7 min: Dortmund are monopolising possession in these early stages, but Tottenham are defending reasonably stoutly under pressure with five across the back when they don\u2019t have the ball. Dortmund left-back Abdou Diallo sends in a cross, which is cleared. 6 min: Jadon Sancho gets down the right touchline and sends in a cross. He\u2019s aiming for Paco Alcacer, but Toby Alderweireld is on hand to clear for Tottenham. 4 min: Dortmund win the first corner of the night, courtesy of a deflected short from Marius Wolf. Raphael Gurreiro sends the ball into the mixer and Tottenham clear their lines. 3 min: Dortmund enjoy their first spell of possession, which comes to an end when Manuel Akanji tries to loft a ball over the top for Mario Goetze to chase. He over-clubs and sends his delivery and sends the ball out of play for a goal-kick. 2 min: Spurs win another throw-in halfway inside the Dortmund half, before Kane is penalised for an late challenge on Julian Wiegl, who goes down clutching his shin. 1 min: Tottenham kick off, their players wearing white shirts, shorts and socks. Dortmund\u2019s players wear their usual home kit of yellow shirts, black shorts and yellow socks. From the kick-off, a long ball is lofted towards Harry Kane on the right flank and Spurs win an early throw-in. The teams are out: At one end of the ground a giant, European Cup mosaic celebrating Dortmund\u2019s European Cup win in 1997 greets them upon their arrival on the pitch. They line up either side of the match officials and the Champions League anthem blares out over the Tannoy. Not long now: Their team may be 3-0 down from the first leg, but Borussia Dortmund\u2019s supporters remain in good heart. The Westfalenstadion is packed; a sea of yellow and black as their fans, including the 25,000 in Die S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne behind one goal go through their pre-match chants. The teams are in the tunnel and kick-off is just a few minutes away. Mauricio Pochettino speaks: \u201cWe need to be ourselves and we need to play in the way we usually play,\u201d he tells dishy BT Sport touchline scamperer Des Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to think the game is 0-0. I wish that we start well the game.\u201d On the inclusion of Harry Winks, he has this to say: \u201cI think you know the last month you know how important Harry Winks was for us. It\u2019s good for the team and it\u2019s good for us that he can play tonight.\u201d And on how he thinks the game will pan out. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d he says. \u201cIn football you need to be aware, concentrate and focus. We need to be strong together and have good communication on the pitch. We need a good start because they\u2019re going to push us from the beginning. We need to show that we are a strong team, show our quality and dominate.\u201d Borussia Dortmund: Burki, Wolf, Akanji, Weigl, Diallo, Sancho, Reus, Witsel, Gotze, Guerreiro, Alcacer. Subs: Hitz, Zagadou, Hakimi, Delaney, Pulisic, Schmelzer, Bruun Larsen. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Davies, Winks, Eriksen, Sissoko, Son, Kane. Subs: Gazzaniga, Rose, Lamela, Wanyama, Dier, Llorente, Lucas Moura. Referee: Danny Makkelie (Holland) Harry Winks is fit to start for Tottenham after missing Saturday\u2019s north London derby with a hip problem. He returns to the starting line-up along with full-backs Ben Davies and Serge Aurier. Jadon Sancho starts for Dortmund, while captain Marco Reus is fit having been injured for the Wembley clash. We\u2019ll have the full line-ups very shortly. With an English team in town, it was no surprise that Dortmund\u2019s Swiss manager was asked for his assessment of a certain youngster\u2019s performances this season. \u201cJadon [Sancho] is a very, very good player,\u201d he said of the teenager who signed from Manchester City last summer. \u201cVery talented. He\u2019s just 18 and sometimes there are ups and downs. He had an outstanding first half of the season. He has a lot to learn, but fortunately he has a lot of potential.\u201d Asked about his side\u2019s chances of overcoming their three-goal deficit, he said \u201cthe first leg is done and this is a different situation. We know we can score goals, but as I said, we have to play very cleverly. Of course, the most important thing is to produce a top performance. Anything is possible. We have to play very cleverly.\u201d Fun fact: Borussia Dortmund are yet to concede at home in the Champions League this season and have scored at least three goals in every home fixture since the turn of the year. Speaking at yesterday\u2019s pre-match briefing, The Tottenham manager spoke of the need for a good start from his side. \u201cIt\u2019s important to start the game at a very good level \u2013 be aggressive, fight from the beginning, high tempo, that\u2019s key,\u201d he said. Asked about the fitness of Eric Dier and Harry Winks, he had this to say. \u201cWe need to assess both [Dier and Winks]. They are here because we still need one day more to assess if they can. Dier has been out for a while and maybe on the bench. Winks we need to see tomorrow.\u201d And on tonight\u2019s match in general: \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to play and go through to the next round in an important competition like the Champions League,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow is going to be a tough game. We need to forget the first leg.\u201d Stirring, exciting stuff. Dele Alli remains a conspicuous absence from the Tottenham midfield, while his manager Mauricio Pochettino will make a late decision on the fitness of Eric Dier and Harry Winks, who are among his side\u2019s lame and halt but have made the trip to Germany. Kieran Trippier has been rested (or \u201crested\u201d depending on your point of view). Dortmund captain Marco Reus is expected to return for Dortmund after missing the first leg with a thigh injury, but Christian Pulisic is unlikely to be available after missing Dortmund\u2019s defeat at the hands of Augsburg on Friday night with thigh issues of his own. In bad news for him but good news for those of us who type minute-by-minute reports for a living, Polish right-back Lukasz Piszczek remains out with a heel injury. Paco Alcacer and Julian Weigl, who were both absent from Dortmund\u2019s line-up in the first leg, are fit again and available for selection. To Germany\u2019s North Rhine-Westphalia, where the Signal Iduna Park is the venue for tonight\u2019s Round of 16 second leg match between Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham Hotspur. Tottenham arrive with a three-goal lead from the first leg at Wembley, leaving the German league leaders with quite the mountain to climb if they are to advance to the quarter-finals of this season\u2019s tournament. As implausible an outcome as it might seem, it would not be without precedent. Of the 130 occasions in European Cup history that one side has won the first leg 3-0 at home, they have gone on to qualify 123 times. Which means they haven\u2019t gone on to qualify seven times. Kick-off is at 8pm (GMT), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
