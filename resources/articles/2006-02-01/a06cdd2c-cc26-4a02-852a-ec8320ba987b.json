At first glance this might seem a perplexing question. After all, mobile phones are not televisions and much of the televisual content they can receive is not in the conventional sense \"broadcast\". However, the Television Licensing Authority (TLA) - responsible for collecting BBC licence fees - last week scotched any notion that mobile phone and computer-based TV viewers might be exempt. It points you to a piece of government business called \"Statutory Instrument 2004 No 692. The Communications Act (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004\", part three sections 9, 10 and 11. Which amended existing regulations arising from The Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1926, 1949 etc and the Communications Act of 2003. To cut a very long story short, any device that can receive live TV pictures, whether or not originally designed or intended to do so, must be covered by a licence if you use it for that purpose. What is more, the TLA will stress that 98% of households have a TV so they already need a licence. Leaving aside how policeable mobile phone TV viewing might be, while the new regulations might have succeeded in redefining the term \"television\" to mean any device capable of receiving it by any broadcast or quasi-broadcast means, they still define a \"television programme service\" as essentially a live, real-time broadcast stream. That doesn't mean just \"live\" programmes but TV broadcast in real time. The problem here - oh do keep up! - appears to be that while the regulations extend beyond traditional broadcasting to cover internet and mobile live streaming, receiving TV programmes on-demand, or say as part of an internet-based catch-up service, appears not to be covered. If correct, this would mean if you only watched programmes on demand via new services - such as the BBC's emerging seven-day catch-up facility, or in any way other than via a live broadcast stream, however delivered, you would not be liable to pay the licence fee even if you used your old-fashioned TV. It seems it is not just hapless producers and broadcasters who have under-estimated the true potential significance of new media delivery systems - witness the growing rumble over programme rights - but the government departments who drafted the new regulations may have missed it too. It may be that the statutory underpinning of the BBC's licence-fee funding, rooted in legislation dealing with \"wireless telegraphy\" from the early part of the last century, could be about to come undone. Digital switchover: is BBC playing fair? The other weekend, Radio 4's flagship Today programme came live from Essex. Amidst the usual range of Saturday morning items and some amusing, if rather predictable, chuckling at the expense of Essex girls there was a piece about the funding and future of the BBC. Simon Sharma said he loved it and Kelvin MacKenzie said he did not. Then a man from Essex, who said he lived on top of a hill and couldn't get Freeview or broadband, wondered where he would be left in the digital world. A top person from the BBC sympathised and hoped it would all be all right come switchover because the power of the Freeview signal could then be increased, thus making it available to him - whenever that happened, if it did. But the most obvious option - a satellite dish - was not mentioned. Is this BBC policy, one wonders? Although there is a cursory formal mention of digital satellite in the BBC's on-air promotions for digital switchover, the price comparison appears misleadingly simple - Freeview cheap, satellite (even free satellite) expensive and the only digital services promoted are the BBC's. The commercial PSB channels would not be allowed to run promotions like this as they would be regarded by Ofcom as unfair to other multichannel commercial operators and unfairly favouring one digital distribution system (Freeview) over others (cable and satellite). Ofcom has produced detailed analysis of this issue in its current consultation on cross-promotional rules. The document has gained most attention for suggesting relaxation of rules governing product placement in commercial TV, but it might have more significant political effect with its suggestion that the BBC be brought under the same rules for promoting digital switchover as the Ofcom-regulated channels. And who would police that do you think? Stand by - the consultation closes this coming Friday.
