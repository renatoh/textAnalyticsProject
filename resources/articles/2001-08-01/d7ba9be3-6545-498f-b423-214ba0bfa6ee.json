The man has no shame when it comes to bad jokes, and anything is pretext for fun when his namesake travels to Hawaii in search of a friend who has disappeared while researching a cookbook (which was published in real life last year). You don't read the Kinkster for rigorous plot mechanics, but for the sheer chutzpah of his picaresque adventures. So if the prospect of a faceless corpse, hoax kidnappers and wild-goose chases in an ersatz paradise tickles your fancy, you won't go wrong. Hardened Tampa journalist Tim Dorsey shares Friedman's sense of fun and impeccable bad taste; his third novel, Orange Crush (HarperCollins, \u00a36.99), is another warped, manic romp through Florida and local politics, evoking the rageful satire of Carl Hiaasen and the malicious vindictiveness of Hunter S Thompson. Set against the background of an election and involving a ventriloquist beauty queen and a serial killer with a taste for magic, this is comic crime at its best. Not quite as manic, but equally enjoyable, is Lauren Henderson's Pretty Boy (Hutchinson, \u00a39.99), the seventh caper featuring sculptor and sleuthette Sam Jones. It begins as a British village mystery, but with Sam behaving badly as usual the scene is soon set for the kind of high jinks you'd never find in a Christie or a Sayers. Nice amoral fun, injecting a tart noir modernity into traditional sleuthing. Giles Blunt's Forty Words for Sorrow (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99) is a superior Canadian police procedural with an evocative sense of place: the frozen lakes and forests are as integral to the plot as the flawed detective, John Cardinal. Four teenagers have gone missing in Algonquin Bay, and Cardinal is himself under investigation, by his own partner. The villains are introduced somewhat too early, but this is still an impressive achievement. James Lee Burke's Bitterroot (Orion, \u00a312.99) is a Billy Bob Holland book set in the wilderness of the Montana valleys. As ever, the sense of place is overwhelming, as Burke's Texas lawyer comes face to face with an old nemesis among the customary savage mayhem. Not quite as gripping as his Louisiana series, and with a couple of far-fetched plot convolutions, but still a mighty pleasure. Paul McAuley's Whole Wide World (HarperCollins, \u00a316.99) turns the London of the near future into a dangerous, exotic place. Set shortly after anti-globalisation terrorists have bombed the City, this is a nightmarish view of policing in a world of all-encompassing surveillance. A renegade cop investigates the brutal murder of a young woman, which has been posted on the internet: a chilling thriller from one of Britain's best SF writers, now turning to crime fiction with awesome ease."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
