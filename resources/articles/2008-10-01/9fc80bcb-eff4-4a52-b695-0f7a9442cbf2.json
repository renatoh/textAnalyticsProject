Late last night Denmark followed suit. Britain had just agreed to raise its maximum level from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000, but may now need to take more radical steps to avoid a flight of savings. British officials were furious with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. They said she gave no indication of the move at a summit in Paris on Saturday designed to coordinate a European response to the economic crisis. The Treasury was last night trying to establish the implications of the German move. Speaking of the decision by the Greek and Irish governments to offer blanket guarantees, the new business secretary, Peter Mandelson, said yesterday: \"It would be better while operating on a country by country basis, we did so in a coordinated way and we brought a collective European view. We are all interlocked. We are in this together.\" Denmark later guaranteed all bank deposits as part of a deal with banks to set up a \u00a33.6bn liquidation fund. The German move came as the Treasury was preparing a contingency plan to take a stake in failing British banks to recapitalise them. This gained the support of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats yesterday. Today the chancellor, Alistair Darling, is due to make his first Commons statement on the credit crunch since the financial turmoil exploded on the markets, but he is not expected to make any major policy statements or announce support for recapitalisation with taxpayers' money. However, he hinted that ministers were looking at more dramatic options when he told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show he was \"looking at a whole range of proposals ... and that means looking at some pretty big steps that you would not take in ordinary times, but we are ready to take them\". Mandelson said every option, including recapitalisation to take a non-controlling stake in a bank rather than a government takeover, would have to be considered. In a significant shift in position, the Tory leader, David Cameron, said he favoured a recapitalisation to strengthen the banking system. \"It is something parties should talk about, and I think it is something where consensus would be better than opposition.\" Previously the Tories had spoken of ailing banks being taken over by the Bank of England to run them down and sell off their profitable assets. The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said yesterday that the government might need to follow the lead of Sweden in the 1990s and buy stakes in a host of banks to shore up their finances. \"The ad-hoc approach is coming to an end and we need to look at much bigger solutions,\" he said. \"We stand here willing to talk to the government about this. Gordon Brown's approach - which is 'look, I'm going to deal with this on a case by case basis' - is running out of road.\" Cameron added: \"The problem at the moment is that the banks are not lending to one another, the Bank of England is meant to be the lender of the last resort. There is a danger of it becoming the lender of the only resort. There is only one thing worse than state aid for the banks, and that is doing nothing.\" Darling has already allowed the Bank to put \u00a340bn into the market this week to ease the problems of banks accessing money, but there are increasing signs that this is dealing merely with the symptoms of the problem. The chancellor also gave a broad hint that he feels the Bank of England is free to cut interest rates on Thursday when he said its remit was not confined to controlling inflation. \"The Bank of England also has a wider duty to support the government's economic objectives,\" he said. He did, however, reject calls from the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, to specifically change the Bank's remit, saying such a move would undermine its independence. Cable had warned: \"We are in a real crisis situation. In an edge of the cliff environment.\" Darling is due today to publish his banking reform bill and jointly chair the first meeting of the new national economic council. The bill will contain measures on guaranteeing depositors' savings, and follows talks with Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. On Wednesday, in the Mais lecture, Darling is expected to drop a broad hint that the scale of government borrowing, in part induced by the financial crisis, means he will be unable to meet the government's so-called sustainable investment rule. The rule laid out by Brown when chancellor in 1997 sets out that borrowing must be strictly limited to ensure that Britain's total public sector debt never exceeds 40%of national income. Without setting out entirely new rules on borrowing and investment, Darling said he would set out in his talk his thoughts on what the new rules should be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
