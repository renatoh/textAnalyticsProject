Tony Mowbray said: \"I can't question my players' commitment; I can feel their frustration in the dressing room at the end. We've given everything we can to try to change it around. So how do you get out of it? You stick together, you work hard, and you try to do the right things every day. You just have to keep going.\" Peterborough United 2-1 Leicester City Bottom side Peterborough gave their manager Darren Ferguson a perfect 41st birthday present with a rousing win over promotion-chasing Leicester: two late strikes taking the points. \"It has been a very good day to get that performance and result,\" he said. \"We were the better team from the off and scored a couple of outstanding goals to get the win. It's also the first time we've come from behind to win a game all season and it was about time we produced a fightback like that. We've always had the belief that we can stay up and hopefully a victory like this will give that belief to the fans.\" Leicester's manager Nigel Pearson said: \"There's no doubt it goes down as a missed opportunity. When you get in front in a game like this, you have to close it out and we failed. We didn't work hard enough to keep a clean sheet.\" And the rest Blackburn secured their third consecutive win to edge closer to the play-offs \u2013 a messy own goal from Ipswich keeper Stephen Henderson giving them a 1-0 win at Ewood Park. \u25a0 Blackpool beat Millwall 2-1, their first home win since December, thanks to a last-minute winner from on-loan striker Nathan Delfouneso. \u25a0 Craig Davies and David Ngog scored second-half goals for Bolton as they came from behind to beat Burnley 2-1. \u25a0 Brighton secured a 1-0 win over Hull via a late Vicente goal. \u25a0 Charlton versus Birmingham looked destined to finish goalless until Yann Kermorgant gave the home side an 88th-minute lead \u2013 only for Wade Elliott to hit a dramatic equaliser two minutes later. \u25a0 Managerless Huddersfield held leaders Cardiff to a 0-0 draw. \u25a0 Sheffield Wednesday came back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at home to Derby. \u25a0 And Danny Batth's first league goal gave Wolves a last-gasp point in a 2-2 home draw with Leeds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
