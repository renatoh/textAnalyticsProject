As a result, both creating life and destroying it are becoming the preserve of those rich enough to pay the costs of going abroad. From today, with the introduction of a law allowing same-sex couples to apply for parental orders \u2013 the legal process by which babies born to surrogates are recognised as part of their new family \u2013 the stress on the courts, and the would-be parents, will only increase. It is not only demand from same-sex couples that is making surrogacy increasingly popular. While it is still a last resort for a tiny minority of childless couples, the adoption of babies in the UK is as difficult as ever, and it is also now virtually impossible to dodge the strict rules controlling adoption from abroad. Meanwhile the British decision to allow children to identify their biological fathers has made sperm donation less popular. Not-for-profit surrogacy has been legal in the UK for 25 years. But women prepared to carry a pregnancy for another couple, probably strangers, are few and far between, and would-be parents face the daunting fact that the surrogacy arrangement is not enforceable in court. Elsewhere in the world, things are more straightforward: in some US states, for example, as well as in India and some former Soviet states. In effect the courts here cannot stop it, as Mr Justice Hedley explained in his November 2008 judgment, because to uphold the law might well leave the child involved without either a state or a family. It was \"almost impossible\" to imagine, he said, circumstances where the child's welfare would not be gravely compromised. Yet even if making it possible for would-be parents to pay did increase the supply of women prepared to be surrogates, it would be at the cost of ethical difficulties as complex as any involved in allowing partners or children to help a loved one to die. The commodification of a woman's body and the risk of exploitation require moral judgments that parliament is invariably reluctant to make. But the way the law stands is a piece of prime hypocrisy, for it is impossible for the courts to uphold without jeopardising the life of a child. It also leaves no way of protecting poor surrogate mothers in distant countries who serve the rich-but-childless here. Better by far to change the law. That would resolve both dilemmas, and treat all British citizens fairly too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
