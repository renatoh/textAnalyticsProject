One casualty could be the reputation of Lord Butler, whose Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction let Tony Blair off the hook. Having pulled his punches, Butler recently called Blair \"disingenuous\", on the basis that Blair's claims \"could simply not have been justified by the material that the intelligence community provided to him\". But the Butler Review also claimed to have seen \"no evidence\" that the dossier was \"explicitly intended to make a case for war\". One might equally ask how Butler reached this conclusion based on the material before him - a stack of evidence that the dossier was always part of the plan for war. The fact that the first draft of the dossier was actually written by Foreign Office spin doctor John Williams - as I have established - shows that Butler's attribution of the dossier to the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) was wrong. It appears that the draft was withheld from Butler, who accepted the government's claim that the dossier was drafted by the JIC's assessments staff. I am hoping that the Information Commissioner will this week order the Foreign Office to release the document under the Freedom of Information Act. In the meantime, it is worth looking at the documents that we know Butler did see - and from which he quoted selectively. A batch of documents originally leaked to the Sunday Times proves that, by spring 2002, Blair had agreed the UK would join the war the US was determined to bring about to depose Saddam Hussein, and that going to the United Nations on the issue of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) was a ploy to justify war, not avoid it. These documents, remain available on dedicated websites and have been widely discussed - not least by Henry Porter - in this context. But they also prove that the dossier was explicitly intended to make a case for war. The earliest document is an options paper prepared by the Cabinet Office in March 2002. A JIC assessment dated March 15 was attached to it, and included the comment that \"intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme is sporadic and patchy\". Nevertheless, the options paper put forward the idea of using WMD as a pretext for a war that would otherwise be illegal: \"A refusal to admit UN inspectors, or their admission and subsequent likely frustration, which resulted in an appropriate finding by the security council could provide the justification for military action.\" Another part of the strategy was \"a media campaign to warn of the dangers that Saddam poses and to sensitise public opinion both in the UK and abroad\". Other documents from the run-up to Blair's April 2002 trip to George Bush's Texas ranch show that Blair had already indicated he would join the attack on Iraq, if it could be spun. A memorandum to Blair, dated March 14 2002, from Sir David Manning, his chief foreign policy adviser, records that Manning had told Condoleezza Rice: that you would not budge in your support for regime change but you had to manage a press, a Parliament and a public opinion that was very different than anything in the States. The centerpiece of the leaked papers is the famous Downing Street memo, a very revealing minute of a meeting at No 10 on July 23 2002. The minute confirms that war was being planned and that JIC chairman John Scarlett, nominally \"in charge\" of the dossier, was in on the plan. Perhaps even more revealing is the briefing paper for that meeting, which records the outcome of the April meeting. Blair had told Bush: \"the UK would support military action to bring about regime change, provided that certain conditions were met: efforts had been made to construct a coalition/shape public opinion ...\" To this end, a \"group of officials under Cabinet Office Chairmanship [should] consider the development of an information campaign to be agreed with the US.\" This paper also observed: Time will be required to prepare public opinion in the UK that (sic) it is necessary to take military action against Saddam Hussein. The dossier was announced six weeks later. The paper also shows Blair's utter hypocrisy in pretending that going to the UN was an attempt to avoid war. It invited ministers to: Agree to engage the US on the need to set military plans within a realistic political strategy, which includes ... creating the conditions necessary to justify government military action, which might include an ultimatum for the return of UN weapons inspectors to Iraq. This should include a call from the Prime Minister to President Bush ahead of the briefing of US military plans to the President for 4 August.\" Blair told Butler that: during the course ... of July and August ... I was increasingly getting messages saying ... 'are you about to go to war?' and I was thinking 'this is ridiculous' and so I remember towards the end of the holiday actually phoning Bush and saying that we have got to put this in the right place straight away ... we've not decided on military action ... he was in absolute agreement ... So we devised the strategy, and this was really the purpose of Camp David ... where we would go down the UN route and ... the purpose of the dossier was simply to say '... here is the intelligence that means ... there is a real issue here.' Almost every word of this is untrue. Not only had war been decided on, but the plan to work through the UN was an attempt to justify it through the setting of a trap. Indeed, the briefing paper expressed the hope that \"an ultimatum could be cast in terms which Saddam would reject.\" As the dossier was being written, Saddam dashed this hope by agreeing to the return of the inspectors. Alastair Campbell's immediate response was to ask Scarlett to sex up the dossier by playing down the idea that the inspectors might succeed: \"In light of the last 24 hours, I think we should make more of the point about current concealment plans.\" Scarlett - and possibly Williams - obliged: \"we have strengthened language on current concerns and plans.\" The government did everything the leaked papers proposed, although \"an appropriate finding by the Security Council\" could not be engineered. But Blair's plan to \"go down the UN route\" was only a detour to a pre-agreed destination. That he trumpeted such a deception as a great achievement says as much about Blair as anything else he has done. That Butler let him get away with it says quite a lot about Butler's commitment to uncovering the truth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
