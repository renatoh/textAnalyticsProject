Why should they have been? See it from their perspective. You and your mates have been trapped inside five pianos on stage at the Hollywood Bowl, waiting for your cue. And what was that cue? As soon as the flamboyant Englishman descends a staircase on to the stage, the piano lids will fly open, each bearing one of the letters of the name ELTON, hopefully in the right order. Your task will be to fly into the California night to a soundtrack of oohs and aahs before laughing boy bangs out Elderberry Wine. It didn\u2019t happen. As Elton John made his entrance into US society in 1973, in a white outfit making him look like the victim of a tarring and feathering, the piano lids flew up, but the birds didn\u2019t. \u201cThe doves had fallen asleep,\u201d he recalled. Like so many matters raised in Elton John: Uncensored (BBC One), questions remain. Were any doves harmed during the making of this concert? Had they nodded off during the sound check? I would have. \u201cIt was the real start of my flamboyant outfits,\u201d said Elton of the night that broke him stateside. Chubby, balding Reg Dwight from Pinner was, by his own charming admission, no Mick Jagger, David Bowie or Marc Bolan. Plus, stuck behind a piano, he couldn\u2019t strut his stuff. He needed a right old zhooshing. Hence the Mozart wig he wore in Australia, the Donald Duck outfit in New York, although possibly not the spotted romper suit he chose for this sit-down with Graham Norton. I have never really cared for Elton\u2019s music, although I did warm to him during this hour-long interview about his six-decade career. It wasn\u2019t just because he was out and proud in the homophobic 1970s, but also because his self-satire cut through the treacle of Norton\u2019s kneel-down-and-derriere-smooch interview technique. How rare to encounter a 72-year-old man laughing at himself rather than onanistically buffing his legacy. Why the toupee? \u201cI don\u2019t like being bald. I look like Shrek.\u201d (Note to non-balds: baldness doesn\u2019t necessarily make you green.) And he endearingly disagreed with critics of his disastrous 80s rug rethink. \u201cThey said it looked like a dead squirrel. More like a dead mole.\u201d He even told of playing a Vegas gig in 2017 only two weeks after a prostate cancer operation. When he took his parting bows, he was in excruciating pain from fluid under his colon (and wearing a nappy). \u201cIf only they knew,\u201d he said, \u201cat that moment I was pissing myself.\u201d So little of the original Elton remains. Hair, tonsils, prostate, appendix have all gone, but he has a pacemaker. \u201cI\u2019m like the bionic woman,\u201d he giggled. Not quite: Lindsay Wagner had superpowers and her own hair. Norton drove to the interview along the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in an open-top Rolls-Royce. Were licence-fee payers bankrolling its rental? Or was it Elton\u2019s, like the private jet he loaned Meghan and Harry? It was the second time this month the BBC was interviewing British royalty. Norton is no Emily Maitlis, although they had two things in common. Both interviewed their subjects on home turf; she in Buckingham Palace, he in Elton and David\u2019s place in Nice. Both outdressed their interviewees \u2013 she in fabulous shoes and cod-military coat, he in a jaunty print jacket and matching shirt. Coming after Prince Andrew\u2019s inquisition, it was impossible not to compare the interviewers\u2019 techniques. Maitlis was forensic, Norton oleaginous. \u201cHis showmanship and unique sense of style fast became legendary \u2013 and all before the age of 25,\u201d oiled Norton. True, Elton has not been accused of having sex with a trafficked 17-year-old victim of a dead sex offender, but, still, one does hope for a nod towards journalistic critical distance from the BBC. Norton didn\u2019t quite ask: \u201cRemind us Elton, why are you so great?\u201d, but the possibility was never remote. Worst, Norton thwarted Elton from describing his coming-out phone call to his mum, instead inviting him to compare his stage outfits to Liberace\u2019s \u2013 about which I couldn\u2019t care less. That said, I was delighted to learn how Elton Hercules John, as Reg became in 1967, chose his middle name. It was after rag-and-bone man Steptoe\u2019s longsuffering horse rather than the lavishly muscled ancient Greek hero \u2013 though the latter, I suspect, has the bigger following in the gay community. Will he ever retire into domestic felicity with his husband and adopted sons? Not soon. If Paul McCartney can announce he is headlining Glastonbury aged 78, it\u2019s unlikely his fellow septuagenarian is quite done. Elton is planning a musical of The Devil Wears Prada. His current so-called farewell world tour may never end. Lots of bits of Elton John have fallen off, but he is still standing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
