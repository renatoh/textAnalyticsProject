Though still inclined to frustration at his own self-perceived shortcomings, he can buckle down much better than he used to. He did so at 5-5, going three up with four to play with a trio of frame winners, 84, 67 and 66. Unexpectedly, though, he lost position on 30 in the next frame and Fu responded with an admirable 101, the 72nd century of a five-year professional career which started promisingly through earning a top-16 ranking in only two full seasons before it hit the buffers. This was largely because his tactical game was weak, but his recovery from 6-2 down to beat Australia's talented, if volatile, No1 Quinten Hann 9-7 showed he was ready for a new ascent. When O'Sullivan ran out of position on 44 at 8-6, Fu won a frame on the pink but hopes of a full-scale recovery were forestalled by O'Sullivan keeping him scoreless in the 16th. John Higgins, O'Sullivan's prospective semi-final opponent was chased all the way by Steve Davis, at 45 years of age enjoying an Indian summer. Trailing 5-3 overnight, Davis twice reduced his arrears to a single frame, on the second occasion with an 88 comprising the first 11 reds with blacks. Higgins, though, always seemed to have an extra gear even if his 8-5 lead was reduced to 8-7 before he closed 9-7. \"Steve played fantastic, every credit it to him,\" said Higgins. \"It was just a ball here and there that changed the score in my favour. He won five or six frames in a single visit and he hasn't done that kind of thing for years. From 8-5 to 8-7 I didn't get much of a chance.\" Peter Ebdon, attempting to become the sixth player to hold world and UK titles simultaneously, took a commanding 7-1 interval lead over Alan McManus while Mark Williams emerged with a 6-2 advantage over Chris Small."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
