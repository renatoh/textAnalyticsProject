According to the home side\u2019s assistant coach Neal Hatley, a \u201cseismic explosion\u201d awaits if his wing Semesa Rokoduguni runs into Fiji\u2019s Nemani Nadolo which, if true, will surely attract the attention of the Guinness Book of Records. Having grown up in Fiji, Rokoduguni is bound to receive special treatment, along with Nathan Hughes, the second Fiji-born player in the home dressing room. Hughes is poised to wear the unfamiliar No7 jersey but the management believe England have enough collective artillery in all areas to subdue the Pacific islanders and extend their winning run under Eddie Jones to 11 matches. Hatley, who used to coach Rokoduguni at Bath, believes the British Army tank soldier is a better player and more composed than when he won his only previous England cap, against New Zealand in 2014. He also reckons Rokoduguni and Hughes will handle whatever Fiji can dish out. \u201cThey are obviously very motivated and we\u2019d like to think they\u2019re motivated to play for England,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it adds a little spice amongst them as individuals ... there could be a seismic explosion on the far side with Nadolo and Rokoduguni running into each other.\u201d It was only last week that Eddie Jones, the head coach, omitted Rokoduguni from his squad for the South Africa game, with his preference for Marland Yarde on the right wing raising eyebrows in Bath. Jones explained he wanted Rokoduguni to have a long and successful Test career, which made it crucial to pick his next few games with care. Hatley, either way, is looking forward to seeing what the big, agile wing adds to England\u2019s cause. \u201cEddie has been saying that if you get an opportunity you have to take it. Roko\u2019s been fantastic over the last 18 months and he\u2019s had a really good start to this season. He\u2019s probably been Bath\u2019s out\u2011and\u2011out attacking strike weapon. Playing with someone like George Ford is brilliant because he distributes the ball so well and gives Roko those one-on-one opportunities. He has also got the proper life experience of sitting in and driving a tank ... I think [other] players draw inspiration from that.\u201d Another familiar Bath face is also poised to feature in midfield and Jonathan Joseph is keen to ensure his own omission from the Springboks game was a blip. Something similar applies at full\u2011back where Alex Goode, the Premiership player of the season last year, has spent all year waiting for a starting opportunity under Jones, ironically the coach who first moved him from fly-half to full-back as a youngster at Saracens. Goode believes that having to be patient behind Mike Brown has toughened him up mentally. \u201cWith Eddie it\u2019s about showing fight and competitive spirit. You never want to be dropped but that\u2019s part of professional sport. You\u2019ve got to deal with those highs and lows and it\u2019s how you react to that. A big test for Eddie is the character people show.\u201d Barring any last-minute fitness setbacks, the plan is for Hughes and Billy Vunipola to feature in the back row with Northampton\u2019s Teimana Harrison in reserve. \u201cI don\u2019t think the numbers make a huge difference at the moment,\u201d Hatley said. \u201cNathan brings a big ball\u2011carrying threat and we\u2019ve seen what he can do in the Premiership. It\u2019s a brilliant opportunity for Nathan if he is involved.\u201d England have had another overseas-based coach with them in camp this week, the Carlton AFL coach Neil Craig having been invited to monitor their coaching sessions. England (probable): Goode (Saracens); Rokoduguni, Joseph (both Bath), Farrell (Saracens), May (Gloucester); Ford (Bath), Youngs (Leicester); M Vunipola (Saracens), D Hartley (Northampton, capt), Cole (Leicester), Launchbury (Wasps), Lawes (Northampton), Robshaw (Harlequins), Hughes (Wasps), B Vunipola (Saracens)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
