A Michigan woman told CNN that the 41st president squeezed her buttocks while she posed for a picture with him at a campaign fundraiser in 1992. The woman, who was not identified by CNN, said she attended the event with her father and \u201cwe got closer together for a family photo and it was like \u2018Holy crap!\u2019\u201d she said of Bush\u2019s grope. Bush, 93, has faced several allegations of groping women during photos in recent weeks but all of the previous allegations took place long after Bush had left office. The latest accuser, whose ex-husband and best friend spoke to CNN about the incident, said the spate of allegations made against Bush convinced her to come forward. \u201cAll the focus has been on \u2018He\u2019s old.\u2019 OK, but he wasn\u2019t old when it happened to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been debating what to do about it.\u201d She is at least the sixth woman to allege Bush groped her. One accuser, actor Joanna Grolnick, described to Deadspin her encounter with Bush. \u201cWe all circled around him and [former first lady] Barbara for a photo, and I was right next to him,\u201d she told the website. \u201cHe reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, \u2018Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?\u2019 As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, \u2018David Cop-a-Feel!\u2019\u201d Jim McGrath, a spokesman for Bush, did not respond to a request for comment about the newest allegation. In response to the groping allegations from the last few years, McGrath last month issued an apology on behalf of Bush. \u201cAt age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures,\u201d McGrath said in a statement. \u201cTo try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke \u2013 and on occasion, he has patted women\u2019s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
