As the early figurehead for gonzo collective PC Music\u2019s synthetic, hyper-real take on pop music, Diamond was caught in a wider conversation surrounding notions of authenticity, with her early singles dismissed as two-dimensional or, worse, the work of male geniuses using her as an avatar. Reflections, a gloriously overwrought breakup album, proves there\u2019s a beating heart beneath Diamond\u2019s self-aware, Photoshopped exterior. Over 10 off-kilter songs, Diamond, whose deadpan, heavily tweaked vocals lend every word a sort of icy detachment, details the stages of a relationship ending, from catching a new flirtation on OTT hyper-ballad Invisible (\u201cdo you wish I wasn\u2019t even there sometimes?\u201d), to unpicking the moment of full implosion on the tactile Never Again. Led mainly by producer AG Cook, Reflections immaculately houses Diamond\u2019s heartache in techno-adjacent bops (Fade Away; the fractured Concrete Angel) or twinkly, snowflake-soft beats, as on the gloopy title track. It\u2019s an album that draws you into Diamond\u2019s world, full of real, 3D emotions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
