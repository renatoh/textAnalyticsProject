Police in the southern California city, which has long grappled with a large homeless population, said on Tuesday that they believe the same suspect is behind three gruesome attacks against homeless people over the weekend, including the two murders. Officials said the department was also investigating whether the three attacks, which occurred within a 24-hour period, could be connected to a series of separate assaults against homeless people in the city in recent weeks. At least seven other homeless people have faced attacks in the last two weeks, police said. On Sunday at around 8am, police responded to a call for a fire and discovered a \u201cdeceased and badly burned body of a male adult\u201d between a local freeway and train tracks. Police later identified the victim as Angelo De Nardo, who was 53 and had family in Pennsylvania. Officials said De Nardo suffered extensive trauma to his upper torso and was dead before his body was lit on fire. On Monday, just before 5am, police received a 911 call for a person who was \u201cdown and bleeding\u201d on the street a few miles south from the first incident. The second victim, also an adult male, was suffering from \u201ctrauma to his upper torso\u201d and was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, according to police. At 6.10am, one hour later, police responded to another call regarding a person who was bleeding from his upper torso. The victim, an adult male, was dead when police arrived. Police have released video footage and grainy photos of a possible suspect, whom they described as a man between 30 and 50 years old with a baseball hat and backpack who was spotted running from the first crime scene, involving the fire. \u201cWe definitely believe \u2026 all three attacks are related,\u201d police captain David Nisleit said. The early investigation suggests that \u201cthese are just random attacks on homeless individuals doing \u2026 nothing\u201d, he said. \u201cIn two cases, they are just sleeping.\u201d Nisleit said that the department did not have any evidence linking the three attacks to earlier assaults against homeless people in June, but he added that the agency was \u201ctaking a hard look at that and seeing if there is any connection\u201d. Since 21 June, seven homeless men in different parts of the city have been hit by an attacker in the middle of the night while they were sleeping, said Lt Martha Sainz, whose division is handling those separate investigations. \u201cThey were all struck in the head with something hard,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re all sleeping. They\u2019re all exposed. They\u2019re all homeless.\u201d One victim said he was hit with a metal object, Sainz added. Her division is investigating whether those seven cases involve the same suspect. \u201cPeople are afraid. There\u2019s no doubt,\u201d said Michael McConnell, a local advocate for homeless people. \u201cThere\u2019s a killer amongst us.\u201d For many living on the streets in San Diego, violence is a regular threat, McConnell added. \u201cAttacks against people who are homeless is not uncommon. Random attacks are not uncommon. A lot of people don\u2019t report them.\u201d News of the disturbing killings has further exacerbated the trauma many people on the streets suffer \u2013 particularly vulnerable groups, including women, children, the elderly and the disabled, said Jeeni Criscenzo, president of Amikas, a local not-for-profit organization that works with homeless people. \u201cWomen and children are always at risk of being victims. And the trauma of that fear inhibits their ability to not only function in the present, but to get beyond the present,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with PTSD \u2026 This is just adding to it, making it worse.\u201d Nisleit said this was the first case he could recall in recent times of a suspect appearing to randomly target multiple homeless people. The police department recommends that people living on the streets stay in groups for their safety, he added. \u201cIn two of these cases, our victims were by themselves kind of off the beaten path, in very isolated areas,\u201d he said. Criscenzo said the assaults should encourage the city to stop criminalizing homeless people and clearing encampments, which can place them in danger. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing by dispersing people on the the streets is breaking up these family units,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are scrambling to reorganize themselves. That does lead them to be a lot more vulnerable.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
