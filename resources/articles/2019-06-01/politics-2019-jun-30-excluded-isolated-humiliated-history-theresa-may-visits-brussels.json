Here is a rundown of her visits in Brussels\u2019 version of the Big Brother house. Start as you mean to go on It started with a \u201cpfff\u201d. Asked about May\u2019s Brexit comments at her first EU summit, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, gave a gallic shrug and did his impression of a tyre with a slow puncture. In October 2016, three months after becoming leader of the Conservative party and taking the keys to Downing Street, the then unknown quantity that was the second female UK prime minister had arrived in Brussels \u2013 and treated the 27 other heads of state and government to their first blast of Maybot. In a five-minute slot at 1am, after a six-hour session on the migration crisis and Russian aggression in Syria, May delivered her \u201cclear message\u201d that the UK was leaving the EU but would play a full role until that point. \u201cWe had no special event with Theresa May,\u201d said Junker. Alone with the plant pots Staring at an empty table with only a row of plant pots for company, the image of a dejected-looking May at the October 2017 European council offered a neat pictorial summary of the state of the Brexit negotiations that autumn. Britain was desperate to move on from talking about the withdrawal agreement \u2013 citizens\u2019 rights, the divorce bill and the Irish border \u2013 and on to talks about the future trade relationship. The EU felt that \u201cinsufficient progress\u201d had been made. Juncker used a summit press conference to deny reports that May had pleaded for her political life at a recent dinner and was \u201canxious\u201d, \u201ctormented\u201d, \u201cdespondent and discouraged\u201d. She had been in \u201cgood shape\u201d and \u201cfighting\u201d, Juncker insisted. Humiliated The prime minister had weathered the resignations of her Brexit secretary, David Davis, and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, after unveiling her Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU that summer. The EU27 joining her in September 2018 at a meeting in Salzburg in the Austrian alps had intended to offer warm words as the British prime minister sought to finalise the withdrawal agreement in Brussels, and then try to sell it at home. Instead, provoked by an ill-thought-out editorial from the prime minister published in a German newspaper accusing the EU of demanding the unacceptable over Northern Ireland, the leaders went on the attack. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, ripped up Chequers. \u201cThose who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it\u2019s going to bring a lot of money home are liars,\u201d said Macron. Later an image circulated via Instagram. A cake had been offered to a few leaders and their aides, including May. \u201cA piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries,\u201d read the caption alongside the picture of May and the European council president, Donald Tusk. With relations soured, Tusk was accused in the media, to his horror, of mocking the diabetic British prime minister. The next day, back in Downing Street, May made a statement asking for mutual respect. Nebulous, moi? \u201cYou called me nebulous?\u201d It was 14 December 2018, and a few moments before the European council \u2013 the EU\u2019s 28 leaders \u2013 were to sit down to discuss the issues of the day. It was unclear whether the prime minister was aware but the TV cameras had yet to be turned out of the summit room. May made a beeline for Juncker. \u201cWhat did you call me? You called me nebulous.\u201d \u201cNo I didn\u2019t, no I didn\u2019t\u201d, responded a startled European commission president. Juncker had hours earlier used exactly that word to describe the negotiating positions emerging from Britain. \u201cWe were not dancing \u2026 she thought that I did criticise her,\u201d Juncker later admitted of their \u201crobust discussion\u201d. \u201cAnd in the course of the morning after having checked what I said yesterday night, she was kissing me,\u201d he added with a smile. Awkward The emergence of the former Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans as front runner to replace Juncker as the next European commission president leaves May in a tricky spot. Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia looked likely to try to block Timmermans as he has been a strident advocate for the rule of law in countries where it has been threatened in his role as vice president of the commission. Italy\u2019s populist government could go the same way, leaving May with a casting vote. She arrived at the summit and lived up to the dramatic moment by promising to be \u201cconstructive\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
