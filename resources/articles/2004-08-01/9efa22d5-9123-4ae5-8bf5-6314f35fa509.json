The gargantuan carnivore of the Cretaceous hatched from its egg as a bantamweight, slowly plumped up into a one-tonne juvenile and then - between the ages of 14 and 18 - started putting on weight at the rate of 2.1kg a day. In four years, the monster that dominated the Hollywood movie Jurassic Park went from one to five or six tonnes, scientists from Chicago, New York, Ohio, California and Florida report in Nature today. It then stopped growing altogether, to survive for another decade at its top fighting weight. \"Knowing the lifeline is important because now we understand the evolution of T rex's gigantism, one of the most fascinating aspects of dinosaurs,\" said Peter Makovicky of the Field Museum in Chicago. His co-author, Gregory Erickson of Florida State University, said: \"We now know that T rex lived fast and died young.\" The first dinosaurs to evolve 225m years ago were small creatures, only a few feet long. The last dinosaurs, more than 150m years later, were colossal. T rex in particular has had palaeontologists scratching their heads for decades. The monster is equipped with a 6ft skull, huge jaws, and a pathetic little pair of forearms so short it could not even pick its own teeth. The big questions have always been: how did it get so huge? And was it a predator, or a scavenger? The US researchers used a cross-section of leg bones to calculate the mass of each specimen in the American collections. Then they used a new technique to count the annual growth rings in other bones belonging to a whole collection of the tyrannosaur family. They were then able to match age against weight gain, and identify the \"teenage spurt\" that took T rex into the heavyweight class. The T rex in the Steven Spielberg movie Jurassic Park famously snatched and devoured a lawyer cowering in a lavatory. Palaeontologists have since heartlessly adopted the lawyer as a standard unit of dinosaur diet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
