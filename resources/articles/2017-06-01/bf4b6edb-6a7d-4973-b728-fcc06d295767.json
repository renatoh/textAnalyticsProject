The Campbelltown-based builder believes in doing things directly: he builds homes, sells them himself and is always wary of middlemen. He even holds his own real estate agent\u2019s licence, which makes him feel like he knows the enemy. \u201cI can sell better than any real estate agent in Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy do they ask for a 2.4% commission? Any real estate agent in Australia can ring me and my question is: \u2018What do you do that means you can charge 2.4%?\u2019\u201d \u201cThey should get,\u201d here he pauses, \u201c$500 maximum.\u201d Alam, who did not want his last name used, is in the process of selling a four-bedroom home in Elderslie, south-western Sydney. He has listed it on Gumtree with a few photos and a $780,000 pricetag. With Sydney\u2019s house prices rising 20% in the 12 months to April, Alam is a frequent property investor and among a growing number of people looking to dodge the tens of thousands of dollars in agents\u2019 commissions. At the time of publication, Gumtree Australia had nearly 6,000 properties listed for sale. \u201cSell your own property\u201d sites, such as forsalebyowner.com.au and buymyplace.com.au, provide marketing, photography and ad placements for between $600 and $2,000 and say they are surging in popularity. Purplebricks, a UK company which uses agents but charges discounted fees by connecting sellers on an online portal, says it processed 435 sales in its first six months in Australia after launching last year. However, John Cunningham, the president of the Real Estate Institute of NSW, says data from two years ago shows only 1% of sales are made without agents, excluding sales to close friends or relatives. Across Australia, the only thing you need to legally sell a house is a valid contract of sale. Private sellers like Alam deal with buyers directly, handling all the advertising, photography, inspections and negotiation themselves. Contracts \u2013 and the accompanying exchange and settlement \u2013 are usually handled with the help of a solicitor or conveyancer, but they are not strictly necessary. The Law Society of NSW advises that it is legal to draft your own contract and do your own conveyancing, but recommends hiring a solicitor. \u201cIt is legal ... However the risks may outweigh any potential savings,\u201d says a spokeswoman. According to the Law Society, solicitors help sellers ensure their contracts comply with vendor disclosure laws that vary state-to-state, and also advise them when negotiating the terms of the contract with the buyer. A spokeswoman said sellers should be especially careful in New South Wales, where it is an offence to place a house on the market without a proper contract, or when selling apartments, as strata titles require additional documentation. Naturally, Cunningham, as president of the peak body for real estate agents, also recommends sellers should employ agents. He says average commission rates range from 1%-2% in such high-density areas as Sydney and Melbourne, to 3%-4% in regional areas or states such as Western Australia and Tasmania. On top of that, marketing is charged separately at 0.5% to 1%. For a house in Sydney, where the median price is $1m, that comes to $10,000 \u2013 $20,000 in commission and $5,000 in marketing. In contrast, listing an ad on Domain as a private seller costs $660 for 8 weeks or $770 for 12 weeks. Gumtree listings, where Alam advertises, are free. He says the only person he employs is a solicitor, who costs less than $1,000 per sale. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a market,\u201d he says. \u201cI know how it works. I\u2019ve put advertisements on Gumtree and realestate.com.au and it doesn\u2019t cost that much.\u201d However, Cunningham says the purported savings are a myth: \u201cThe concept of what people think they are saving is not what they are actually doing.\u201d He says real estate agents deliver higher prices for sellers through their experience in negotiating and valuing. \u201cWe are in a really time-poor world, moving into a more specialised world and the whole selling and buying process is one of the highest, emotionally charged things people ever do. You\u2019re dealing in an area where you are being driven by emotion. It\u2019s very hard. \u201cPrivate sellers tend to overprice and thus they miss the market. People think it\u2019s easy to put a price on a property. But you don\u2019t actually know the value of the house in the first place.\u201d He says that sellers who go it alone are making \u201cthe most costly mistake in their lives\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the art of negotiation \u2013 they\u2019re going into a huge unknown world which is quite complex. It\u2019s one of the most psychologically skilled things in the world. They tend to be their own worst enemy on that front.\u201d John rejects the idea that there is any fat to cut in the process, or anything in the business model for the internet to disrupt. \u201cThere\u2019s really not much left here in the equation. If you\u2019re looking for a quote on a plumbing job, you\u2019re not going to choose the cheapest one. You pay for what you get in this life \u2013 I\u2019d rather fly Qantas than Tiger Air\u201d. Amy, who lives in the Blue Mountains, is in two minds. She tells Guardian Australia she and her husband have put their home for sale online \u201cas an experiment\u201d. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made the final decision to go with an agent or without,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve umm-ed and ah-ed and weighed up both sides.\u201d They are selling their family home in Leura, an hour and a half from Sydney by car. It\u2019s a rare level block in the Blue Mountains, on 1,200 square metres with four bedrooms and 2.5-metre ceilings. \u201cWe\u2019re a young married couple who are doing our best to save every cent we can,\u201d she says. \u201cThe money we save can go towards building our new home. We\u2019ve still got a loan that we\u2019re trying to get ahead of by doing this rather than renting. Every dollar counts. \u201cThe advantages seem big, though, in going with an agent. They have many more contacts and experience. And if they do their job properly they want to get the best price they can. But then you\u2019ve got this whacking great fee.\u201d Amy says she\u2019s received quite a few inquiries on Gumtree, but doesn\u2019t know if any are genuine enough to proceed. \u201cMost of them just messaged, and when I got back to them, they\u2019d never ring.\u201d They have a solicitor, and Amy, who is a photographer, has done the publicity shots herself . Crucially, they\u2019ve had the house valued by real estate agents multiple times \u2013 for free \u2013 and say it sits around the high $700,000s. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably had about six or eight through in the past 18 months. We really want to know what we\u2019re talking about. We keep a close eye on the market and the houses around us so we\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019re fairly accurate.\u201d Alam also denies that private sellers need agents to value their own homes: \u201cI do market research, I look at previous sales, then I figure it out. It\u2019s not hard.\u201d In January, Victoria introduced legislation to crack down on real estate agent underquoting, after receiving 236 complaints in 2015. Alam also disputes the idea that agents are better negotiators, saying the three he has previously sold with were unimpressive. \u201cThey didn\u2019t drive a really good price for me, they just tried to sell the property. Some of them are really, really unprofessional because they just don\u2019t care. \u201cIt is my property, I know how to deal, I know how to sell it.\u201d Amy however, says the issue of an emotional connection to a family home is very real. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely true and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we might go with an agent. All that negotiation side of it is left up to someone else. It\u2019s all a learning curve. \u201cA lot of agents aren\u2019t very honest. But there\u2019s a lot of good ones out there, there\u2019s honest ones, there\u2019s a couple that we know. You don\u2019t have a lot of faith when you know that others have a track record of not being entirely honest, I haven\u2019t personally experienced that.\u201d In one week of his listing, Alam has received 105 views and three offers, and he is supremely confident. \u201cHopefully it will be sold in a few days,\u201d he says. He does not plan to use an agent ever again. \u201cI wish somebody would come out and break their business like Gumtree. Maybe one day I will do it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
