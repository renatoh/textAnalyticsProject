There was a 17% increase in the number children being taken into care between the last quarter of 2007 and the same period in 2009, the poll found, putting a strain on foster care services and council budgets. Councils were struggling to keep pace with demand. Social worker numbers rose by just 10% over the same period. Vacancy levels in children's services departments were running at 12.5%, while over half the councils reported they had unfilled posts for children's social workers or managers. Marion Davis, new president of the Association of Directors of Children's Services, which conducted the survey, said the findings demonstrated the difficult pressures faced by local authorities. \"It is clear from the 10% increase in staffing that councils are aware of increasing pressures and are taking steps to increase the number of staff dealing with child protection concerns,\" she said. \"But councils have not been able to keep pace with the dramatic rise in demand.\" The survey, carried out in March, took information from 105 local authorities in England, 69% of all councils. It found: \u2022 Investigations into abuse or neglect of youngsters had risen by 20.3%. \u2022 Emergency protection orders \u2013 when there are concerns that a child is in immediate danger \u2013 increased by 32%, while courts granted 38% more interim care orders to give local authorities responsibility for children's well-being. \u2022 Cases where children were brought to the attention of social workers by the public or professionals rose by 24.6%. Davis said the horrific case of 17-month-old Baby Peter \u2011 which came to light in late 2008 \u2011 was only one factor influencing the increase in safeguarding activity: \"We believe this shows that this is not a knee-jerk reaction to high-profile cases but rather that agencies are getting better at identifying those children who require extra support.\" She warned that child protection services faced \"potential turmoil and uncertainty\" over the next few months as a result of the general election. The Tories are proposing to dismantle local children's trusts, which were created by Labour to bring safeguarding services together. Baby Peter died at the hands of his mother, her lover and their lodger in Tottenham, north London, in August2007 despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police over the last eight months of his life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
