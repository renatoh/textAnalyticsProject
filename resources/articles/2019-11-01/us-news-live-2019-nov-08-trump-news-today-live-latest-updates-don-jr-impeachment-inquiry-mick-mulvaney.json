Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg appears to have officially entered the 2020 Democratic presidential fray, but has made no formal announcement. Lawyers for Donald Trump plan on going to the Supreme Court over an appeals court ruling that his accounting firm must hand over eight years of his tax returns to New York state prosecutors. Yet another aide for billionaire and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer has resigned over misconduct allegations. The team behind Michael Bloomberg has said that \u201cif we run\u201d, they would bypass the four early-voting state - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina - and focus on doing well on Super Tuesday and beyond. Though he has not officially announced yet , he\u2019s already getting flack for his decision to ignore the early states. Billionaire and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer has had some questionable happenings in his campaign recently. A South Carolina aide stole volunteer data from Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, and later resigned. And now this: Lawyers for Donald Trump say they\u2019ll be going to the supreme court over the matter of New York state prosecutors obtaining his tax records, the Associated Press is reporting. A US appeals court ruled on Monday that Trump\u2019s accounting firm must hand over eight years of his tax returns to New York prosecutors. In a letter to the US district Judge Victor Marrero on Friday, Trump\u2019s lawyers and the state prosecutor said that they can fully brief the matter no later than 25 November if the high court agrees to review rulings against Trump by Marrero and an appeals court. That would allow the supreme court to decide the case in its current term. Michael Bloomberg is officially on the ballot in Michigan too, but still no announcement. Seriously, how hard is it to toss a tweet up announcing your run? So...are we going to get that official campaign announcement, or....? Just under the wire for Michael Bloomberg: Who here remembers Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, who was the chief White House physician that Donald Trump nominated for secretary of veterans affairs in 2018? That\u2019s right, the doctor who withdrew his nomination following accusations that he once got so drunk that he wrecked a government vehicle and handed out so many prescription drugs that he was nicknamed \u201ccandyman\u201d? (He denied all the allegations). Well, it looks like Jackson is now considering a run for Congress. According to Roll Call, Jackson, a Republican and a native Texan, is eyeing the 13th District, now open after Congressman Mac Thornberry announced his retirement. Hi all, Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking over the blog for the rest of the day. Let\u2019s try not to get into any trouble. It\u2019s been an eventful Friday afternoon \u2013 here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s been happening: The transcripts of two diplomats and witnesses to the Ukraine scandal, Fiona Hill and Lt Col Alexander Vindman, were released today. Mick Mulvaney was largely implicated in both for being a key agent in withholding Ukraine\u2019s aid. Trump said that he is considering taking up an invitation from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to attend a Russian military parade in May. He also called Michael Bloomberg \u201cLittle Michael\u201d and said he\u2019s not worried about the billionaire entering the race. House Republicans appointed Jim Jordan, a Republican representative from Ohio, to the House intelligence committee. Jordan\u2019s new spot will allow him to grill witnesses as public impeachment hearings are set to begin next week. A lawyer for the former US national security adviser John Bolton said there are more Trump-Ukraine-related meetings and conversations that Congress does not know about, according to a report from the New York Times. Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, testified against Trump ally Roger Stone in court today. Bannon said that Stone was the \u201caxis\u201d between the Trump campaign and Wikileaks. Ben Carson: It takes \u201ca lot of courage\u201d to be a Trump supporter At the Black Voices for Trump coalition rally in Atlanta this afternoon, Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson warmed up the crowd by thanking the crowd for their \u201ccourage\u201d. \u201cIn our society today, it takes a lot of courage to say that you\u2019re supporting President Trump.\u201d he said. The kind of \u201cmanipulation\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d that comes with being a Trump supporter, he said, has been going on \u201csince we\u2019ve been in America\u201d, citing slavery and Jim Crow laws. Side note: In 2016, 8% of black Americans voted for Trump, compared to 89% who voted for Hillary Clinton. He predicted that he would win 95 percent of the black vote. Bloomberg has a 5pm deadline today to file for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama, but he (and presumably his staff) have yet to be seen. *eyes emoji* Forbes released an estimate of the net worth of the Trump siblings using property records, court documents and government filings. Ivanka reigns on top, in part thanks to her marriage to Jared Kushner. Her wealth is estimated to be $375m. Don Jr. and Eric are estimated to be worth about $25m each. Tiffany, 26, and Barron, 13, have yet to inherit much from their father. Their older siblings have gotten most of their cash by serving as executives at the Trump Organization. Ivanka\u2019s serving as vice president of the organization got her $25m. Her now-defunct fashion line, at its peak, got her $10 million a year at the height of its popularity. All Melania has gotten is \u201ca small Trump Tower apartment\u2026 worth $1.5m\u201d. Womp womp. Biden on Bloomberg: I welcome him in the race Former vice president and presidential candidate Joe Biden said that he welcomes former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg into the race. Bloomberg\u2019s still-unofficial entry into the Democratic primary has been seen as a sign the billionaire believes Biden won\u2019t be able to muster a promising campaign against progressive Democrats. Earlier in the year, there had been whispers that Bloomberg was gearing up for a race but was carefully watching Biden\u2019s moves to see if he would run. He announced in March that he would not be seeking the Democratic candidacy, a month before Biden launched his campaign April. Just... wow Students hold rally in DC in support of DACA Students in Washington D.C. led protests in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The program, implemented under the Obama administration but rescinded under the Trump administration, offers those who were brought to the US as undocumented children legal protections that allow them to stay in the country. About 660,00 people are \u201cDreamers\u201d, the nickname for DACA recipients. Next week, the Supreme Court will decide whether the Trump administration\u2019s cut of DACA is constitutional. Two lower courts in California, New York and D.C. found that the administration violated something called the \u201cAdministrative Procedure Act\u201d by killing the act. \u201cWe are more than number. We are people with families, communities, and dreams,\u201d said one student at a protest in Washington. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is currently testifying against Roger Stone, a political operative and ally of Trump, in court. Stone is accused of lying to the House intelligence committee about the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to obtain incriminating emails hacked by Russia and published by Wikileaks to harm Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky announced that Bannon would be a surprise witness in the trial earlier this week. \u201cStone regularly updated people on the Trump campaign at the senior levels about whatever information he thought he had about WikiLeaks,\u201d Zelinsky said, adding that he went directly to Bannon with the info. Stone has pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing justice, witness tampering and lying to the committee. According to Politico\u2019s Darren Samuelsohn, who is live-tweeting the trial, Bannon said that Stone told him prior to joining the campaign that he had a relationship with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange. After he joined the campaign, Stone continued to tell him about his ties to Wikileaks. He confirmed that the campaign viewed Stone as an \u201caxis point\u201d to WikiLeaks. A lawyer for John Bolton, former US national security adviser, wrote a letter to lawmakers that there are \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations\u201d related to the administration\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine that House impeachment investigators don\u2019t know about, according to the New York Times. Bolton was scheduled for a deposition in front of the House impeachment committees yesterday but, like many of his White House peers, did not appear. Charles Cooper, Bolton\u2019s lawyer and author of the letter, said that Bolton was involved in not only meetings and discussions that have been revealed through existing testimony, but \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\u201d Bolton is waiting for a judge to rule on whether he and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, can defy White House orders not to testify. House Republicans have appointed US congressman Jim Jordan, a Republican representative from Ohio, to the House intelligence committee. Republicans are gearing up a line of defense as impeachment hearings are set to begin next week. Jordan has been a vocal critic of the impeachment inquiry, called the investigations a \u201csham\u201d. He is currently the top Republican on the House oversight committee, one of the committees that oversees the inquiry, but will be able to ask witnesses questions as part of his new committee. Trump supporters gather for rally in Atlanta Quick break from impeachment coverage. Trump is slated to speak at a rally in Atlanta for the new Black Voice for Trump coalition. The president is expected to speak at 3pm, and supporters have already gathered in anticipation. Here\u2019s more from Khushbu Shah, who\u2019s at the rally in Atlanta: The path leading up to the Black Voices for Trump launch is lined with police (and more police) and security, but not a single protester is to be found. However, waiting to enter a conference room in the back of the the Georgia World Congress Center are Trump supporters. Some are wearing the ubiquitous MAGA hats seen at any Trump event, a few in couple cowboy hats, and some in Black Voters for Trump shirts. Diamond and Silk, social media personalities and Fox Nation hosts are escorted to the front of the line and pass through security with Herman Cain, who Trump announced he was recommending for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board earlier this year before Cain withdrew his name for consideration. Cain, a former pizza exec, briefly ran for the 2012 Republican Presidential nomination but dropped out after sexual harassment allegations came to light. The room where Trump will speak looks to fit a couple hundred people. CL Bryant, who has come down from DC for the day, is an African-American Baptist minister who estimates 400 people might fit in the room, though it looks much smaller. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney approved a White House meeting for the Ukrainian president \u2013 if Ukraine announced investigations tied to Joe Biden, a political rival of Donald Trump, according to testimony unveiled on Friday by the congressional committees pursuing an impeachment inquiry. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, \u201cblurted out\u201d that Mulvaney had approved the meeting if the Ukrainians announced an investigation of Burisma, a gas company that formerly employed Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, said Fiona Hill, a national security council member who was deposed by the committees last month. Hill\u2019s account was corroborated by simultaneously released testimony by another firsthand witness to the conversation, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. While previously released testimony has indicated a central role for Mulvaney in brokering an agreement in which Ukraine would intervene in the 2020 US election by announcing the Burisma investigation, the testimony released Friday was the first to describe direct involvement in the plot by the acting chief of staff. Hill described for investigators a 10 July meeting attended by herself, Sondland, nationals security adviser John Bolton, Ukrainian officials and others. Hill testified: \u201cThen Ambassador Sondland blurted out: \u2018Well, we have an agreement with the chief of staff for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start.\u2019 \u2026And Ambassador Bolton immediately stiffened and ended the meeting.\u201d Vindman gave a similar account of the meeting. \u201cI heard him say that this had been coordinated with White House Chief of Staff Mr. Mick Mulvaney,\u201d Vindman said. Here\u2019s what happened when House Republicans stormed the room when Fiona Hill was testifying, according to the transcript The House committees released highlights of key passages in the transcripts (which combined are 786 pages long). Here is the top highlight from Fiona Hill, former aide to national security adviser John Bolton: \u201cI went back to talk to Ambassador Bolton. And Ambassador Bolton asked me to go over and report this to our NSC counsel, to John Eisenberg. And he told me, and this is a direct quote from Ambassador Bolton: You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you\u2019ve heard and what I\u2019ve said. So I went over to talk to John Eisenberg about this. \u2026 I told him exactly, you know, what had transpired and that Ambassador Sondland had basically indicated that there was agreement with the chief of staff that they would have a White House meeting or, you know, a Presidential meeting if the Ukrainians started up these investigations again. And the main thing that I was personally concerned about, as I said to John, was that he did this in front of the Ukrainians.\u201d Find more of Hill\u2019s testimony highlights here. And here is the top highlight from Lt Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council: Q: All right. So you did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen. You used the word \u201cdemand,\u201d it was not proper to demand. Where in the transcript do you believe that the President made a demand to investigate a U.S. citizen? A: So, Congressman, the power disparity between the President of the United States and the President of Ukraine is vast, and, you know, in the President asking for something, it became\u2014there was\u2014in return for a White House meeting, because that\u2019s what this was about. This was about getting a White House meeting. It was a demand for him to fulfill his\u2014fulfill this particular prerequisite in order to get the meeting Find more of Vindman\u2019s testimony highlights here. The House impeachment committees have just released a transcript of the deposition of Fiona Hill, a former aide to US national security adviser John Bolton, and Lt Col Alexander S Vindman\u2019s, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council. Previous reports of her testimony, which lasted 10 hours, said Hill claims Bolton was alarmed by the back-channel efforts to pressure Ukraine. Vindman reportedly expressed concerns in his testimony that the president and his allies were trying to enlish Ukraine into a campaign to smear political rivals. Read Hill\u2019s transcript here and Vindman\u2019s here. We\u2019re going through it now. Actress and activist Jane Fonda was back on Capitol Hill today for her weekly climate crisis protest Fire Drill Fridays (the \u201cGrannies unite\u201d version of the student-led climate strikes). Fonda has been arrested multiple times over the last few weeks for her Friday protests in Washington. Here\u2019s something to keep in mind re: Republicans and the impeachment inquiry: An economist who has vouched for US senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u2019s $20.5 trillion healthcare plan has expressed skepticism about the plan\u2019s wealth tax revision. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told Reuters that while he agrees with the calculations behind Warren\u2019s plan, he doesn\u2019t believe the wealth tax will achieve the projected amount needed. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to believe billionaires are going to use every resource to avoid paying the tax,\u201d Zandi said, though he added that Warren may be able to compensate the difference through other tax measures, like a tax on corporations and employers. At a campaign stop in North Carolina yesterday, Warren was asked to respond to criticism that her Medicare for All plan is a pipe dream. \u201cYou don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for,\u201d she said. Referee says US Rep knew about sexual assault allegations against sports doctor Picking up momentum on politics Twitter this morning: An anonymous professional referee alleged in a lawsuit filed yesterday that he told US Congressman Jim Jordan that Richard Strauss, the now-dead Ohio State University sports team physician, masturbated in front of him in a shower in 1994, NBC reported last night. Jordan replied, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s Strauss,\u201d according to the lawsuit. More than 100 former students have accused Strauss of sexual misconduct, according to an investigation that was revealed this summer. Other ex-athletes in July accused Jordan of ignoring the alleged abuses. Jordan, a high-ranking Republican and one of Trump\u2019s top defenders in the impeachment inquiry, was a former assistant coach of the wrestling team at the university. Jordan has denied that he knew, and implicitly overlooked, allegations against the doctor. \u201cI never knew about any type of abuse. If I did, I would have done something about it,\u201d he told Politico in July. Besides saying that he is considering going to a Russia military parade in May (!), Trump answered a bunch of other questions near the White House just moments ago ranging from Ukraine to Michael Bloomberg. Here\u2019s some bits via pool reports: On Gordon Sondland: \u201cI hardly knew the gentleman.\u201d (Note: the gentleman donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s campaign ahead of his inauguration) On the transcript of an earlier call he had with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky: \u201cI will give it if they want it.\u201d He added that the call was good, but releasing the transcript would set a \u201cbad precedent\u201d. On a complete rollback on tariffs against China: \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d On Bloomberg entering the Democratic primary: \u201cHe\u2019s not going to do well, but I think he\u2019s going to hurt Biden actually. \u2026 There\u2019s nobody I\u2019d rather run against than little Michael.\u201d \u201cLittle Michael\u201d, huh? The president just told pool reporters on the White House lawn that Russian president Vladimir Putin invited him to the Russian military parade in May and he is considering attending. Trump at one point admitted that Russia helped elect him as president, though he quickly backtracked on that statement. \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia!\u201d he once tweeted in May in a fury Tweetstorm in the wake of the release of the special counsel\u2019s report. Robert Mueller said in public remarks that his investigation established that the \u201cRussian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder Putin invited him to the parade... Andrew Yang on Michael Bloomberg joining the primary... Ivanka Trump: Identity of whistleblower is not \u201csubstantive part of conversation\u201d Ivanka Trump spoke to the AP earlier this morning in her first interview since the impeachment inquiry began. She gave the usual talking points delivered by her father and his allies: Read the transcript, the impeachment investigation is an attempt to overturn the 2016 election, \u201cAmericans are prospering like never before\u201d, etc. But one thing she said did stick out: \u201cI don\u2019t view the whistleblower as... it shouldn\u2019t be a substantive part of the conversation because this is a third-party who was not privy to the call and did not have firsthand information.\u201d In a stark comparison, the president and his allies have attacked the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity. At a rally in Kentucky earlier this week, Republican senator Rand Paul told media outlets to \u201cdo your job and print his name\u201d as Trump stood behind him, smiling and clapping. Experts say the aggressive strategy of public attacking whistleblowers is risky and can potentially damage the whistleblower system that is meant to keep power in check. An NBC reporter said on Twitter that the House impeachment committees are expected to release transcripts of Fiona Hill and Lt Col Alexander S Vindman\u2019s testimonies today. Hill, a former aide to US national security adviser John Bolton (who was a no-show himself at a schedule deposition yesterday), spoke to the committees for 10 hours last month. Reports of her testimony claim that Hill told them that her former boss was so alarmed by the back-channel efforts to pressure Ukraine, he told a senior aide to report it to White House lawyers. Vindman, a US army lieutenant colonel and the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, reportedly expressed concerns in his testimony that the president and his allies were trying to enlist Ukraine into a campaign to smear political rivals. Happy Friday, and welcome to the politics live blog! This busy week in the impeachment investigations is coming to a close with a sizzle. Last night, the House committees in charge of the impeachment inquiry subpoenaed acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to testify this morning at 9am. Like a handful of White House officials deposed by the committees, Mulvaney will likely be a no-show. Mulvaney admitted during a press conference last month that he withheld $400m of aid to pressure Ukraine. Though he has walked back on his statement, officials who have already testified in front of the House impeachment committees have indicated Mulavaney withheld the aid. That the House committees subpoenaed Mulvaney hints that they are ready to take the impeachment inquiry public next week, a plan they announced Wednesday. Here\u2019s what else is happening in the world of politics today: An interview with Ivanka Trump by the AP was released this morning. The eldest Trump daughter said that while she believes the impeachment inquiry is an attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election, she said the identity of the whistleblower is \u201cnot particularly relevant\u201d, parting ways with her father and his closest allies who have demanded the media to reveal the identity of the anonymous whistleblower. The Elder Trump is heading to Georgia today for a rally to kick off the Black Voices for Trump coalition after he attends a high-dollar fundraiser for a Georgia Repbulican senator. The House is prepared to start the process of revising the Equal Rights Amendment to allow Virginia to ratify the amendment after the state\u2019s legislature turned blue earlier this week. An amendment needs ratification from 38 states to become a part of the Constitution. Virginia would be the 38th state to ratify the amendment, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
