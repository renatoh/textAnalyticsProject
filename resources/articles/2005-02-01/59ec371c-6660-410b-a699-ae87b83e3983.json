Passengers booked on flights from any airport in the EU will be able to claim compensation of up to \u20ac600 (about \u00a3428) if the service is cancelled or they are 'bumped off' because the airline has sold too many seats. EU airlines will also have to pay up to \u20ac1,180 (about \u00a3842) for lost, delayed or damaged luggage under the legislation, which applies to all airlines, chartered and scheduled, including 'no-frills' carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair. Simon Evans, of the Air Transport Users Council, said: 'This is good news for passengers. It has doubled the compensation they will get for being involuntarily bumped off flights and it will make airlines think again about overbooking.' Compensation payments will be fixed, so a passenger who has paid just a few pounds for their seat will get as much as someone who has paid for a business class fare. When a flight is cancelled without sufficient notice or passengers are 'bumped', they will get: \u00b7 \u20ac250 for flights of less than 1,500km (\u00a3178) \u00b7 \u20ac400 for flights of 1,500-3,500km (\u00a3285) \u00b7 \u20ac600 for flights over 3,500km outside the EU. Airlines will have to give passengers a choice of a full refund or alternative transport to their destination, plus refreshments and accommodation, where necessary. The payout will be halved if an alternative flight is found within four hours. Passengers on short flights delayed by two hours or more or on longer flights which are delayed for four hours or more will also be entitled to refreshments and accommodation, where necessary, and communication facilities. When an EU airline is responsible for a long delay anywhere in the world, passengers can claim up to \u20ac4,897 (about \u00a33,500) for resulting damages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
