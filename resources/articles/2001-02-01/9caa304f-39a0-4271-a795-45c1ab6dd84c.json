Ten weeks ago it was possible to believe that this season's European Cup final might be contested by two English teams. Now England would be grateful to get two into the Champions League quarter-finals. Leeds United were the heroes of the games played before the tournament went into hibernation. Against all odds David O'Leary's side bearded and beat Lazio's Roman lions in their own arena, thereby hastening the arrival of Sven-Goran Eriksson as England's coach. On the same night Arsenal surrendered a two-goal lead to Bayern Munich to be held 2-2 at Highbury, and the following evening Manchester United savoured their plum of a second-round draw with an easy 2-0 win away at Sturm Graz. So after two matches in the second phase Manchester United have taken an early command of Group A, Leeds, with Anderlecht, are tucked in behind Real Madrid in Group D, and Arsenal are last in Group C. From an English point of view the next 72 hours are unlikely to bring a dramatic improvement, quite the reverse in fact. Take tomorrow evening. Arsenal, whose away form this season has been patchy at best, face Lyon in the Gerland stadium needing a win but knowing they will be hard pressed to scrape a draw. The French side have lost once in 16 matches and, despite qualifying from the first round with three defeats, they have the knack of winning essential games, witness the 3-0 win over Spartak Moscow after losing 1-0 away at Bayern. Lyon will be looking to the goalscoring potential of Steve Marlet and Sonny Anderson in their pursuit of a quarter-final place. Arsenal, having already conceded six goals in the second phase, must reacquire their better defensive habits if Group C is not to become a triangular tournament between Lyon, Bayern and Spartak. Since Leeds beat Lazio the season at Elland Road has spawned five wins and four defeats in the Premiership and an early departure from the FA Cup. With scant chance of finishing in the top three, O'Leary knows that his sole chance of appearing in next season's Champions League lies in winning it this time, an even more remote hope. Still, Leeds have so far confounded logic in their more difficult European encounters, and Anderlecht lost 5-1 at Old Trafford in the first phase and 4-1 to Real in the second. But, like Leeds, they have defeated Lazio 1-0 and will come to Elland Road backed by a run of nine successive victories in Belgium. Leeds are still producing fluent football, but only spasmodically. The youthful sheen is wearing off O'Leary's side and having two of your most important players standing trial for assault is not the ideal way to resume operations in the Champions League. If Leeds can win tonight they will make a strong case for a place in the last eight, but with their next two matches away to Anderlecht and Real they cannot afford to drop more points at home. Compared with Arsenal and Leeds the prospects for Manchester United appear serene. With maximum points so far from the second phase, they have surely allayed the doubts that arose from taking only one point from three away matches in the first round. Tomorrow's match in Valencia will test the truth of this supposition. With Jaap Stam back in the heart of defence, Sir Alex Ferguson will have fewer fears of suffering a repeat of Brussels, where Anderlecht raced to a 2-0 lead in a half the United manager described as \"an absolute nightmare\". Yet Valencia, though well beaten by Real in last year's all-Spanish European Cup final, remain daunting opponents on their own ground and this season are proving miserly, conceding only 16 goals in 22 league games, four in the Champions League first round and none so far in the second. A draw in the Mestalla stadium would not disappoint Ferguson. Even a defeat would be offset by the fact that United have home matches against Valencia and Sturm Graz to come. At this stage United, Bayern and Real look the best bets for the quarter-finals, with Valencia, Spartak, Galatasaray, Milan and Anderlecht most likely to join them. If there is to be another English representative it will surely be Leeds. Arguably the most intriguing European encounter involving English interests this week is in the Uefa Cup, where Liverpool meet Roma in their fourth-round away leg. Who knows, this could be a preview of next season's Champions League. Certainly the present participants must be grateful the Italian league leaders, Gabriel Batistuta, Cafu et al, are for the moment confined to the plate competition. \u0095 Valencia's midfielder Miguel Angel Angulo denied yesterday that comments he made last week implied that his side had agreed to draw last season's Champions League match with Manchester United. \"A part of what I said last Friday has been taken completely out of context,\" he said. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
