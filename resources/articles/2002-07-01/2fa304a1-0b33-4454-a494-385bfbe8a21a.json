Chris Keates, deputy general secretary of the National Association of School Masters Union of Women Teachers, said her members were \"taken aback\" by the minister's commitment to embark on negotiations with teachers over workload. The pledge was outlined in a pamphlet published today to accompany Estelle Morris' speech on reform to the House of Commons. Ms Keates said this was \"very welcomed,\" but warned that part and parcel of any agreement reached would be to ensure that school management and national government policy on teacher workload and pay were in line. On proposals to expand the specialist school system, Ms Keates said: \"It will clearly change the nature of comprehensive education and will need closer examination. I'd want to be sure that she [Estelle Morris] understands that high quality education isn't dependent on superheads or super schools. Teachers in the classroom must be a key focus of change\". Both the NASUWT and the National Union of Teachers said reform was conditional on the outcome of new workload discussions with the government. John Bangs, NUT head of education, said the government's commitment to specialising schools was \"dangerous and irrelevant\". \"I don't know why they are still playing with a multi-tiered system - that will not attract more teachers. It will favour some schools over others, creating dead-end situations. The plethora of targets she's tacking on to the system will only narrow the curriculum and undermine professional confidence,\" he said. And headteachers are angry at the prospect of having to pay for not reaching government targets - possibly with their jobs. Eric Spear, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"The idea that headteachers should be dismissed because they don't meet the government's agenda is wrong. The government's agenda is not necessarily the only valid one. We have reservations over the direction in which they are pushing schools. We think it is misguided. \"There are schools that are doing well in terms of the communities they are working with, but not necessarily academically. It's wrong to fit the same measures to all schools. It's a one size fits all accountability system, which will not work in the context of the school,\" he explained. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, went further, saying Ms Morris had revealed nothing new in her speech. While welcoming extra funds, he added that headteachers were already doing all the things she was proposing. \"Headteachers already collaborate and help their neighbouring schools. There is the will to collaborate among headteachers, part of this is to escape from the culture of competition that has bedevilled schools for 20 years.\" On the prospect of headteachers being sacked on the grounds of failing to achieve targets, he said: \"That is already happening to a greater degree than people realise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
