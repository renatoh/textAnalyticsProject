While Manchester is presenting him as an inspirational pioneer by pairing his works with newly commissioned pieces, Vasily Petrenko and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic are adopting a more traditional contextual stance. The results, however, can be equally startling. This concert paired the Second Symphony with Berg's Seven Early Songs. They share a similarity of musical language but not of purpose: Mahler's vast, apocalyptic drama inhabits territory far removed from Berg's examination of the nature of desire. Rejecting the usual view that Berg's songs are primarily about art nouveau refinement, Petrenko presented them as explicit and unnerving. A bitterness in the woodwind tone hinted at emotional uncertainties and prevarications. The throbbing oscillations of Liebesode teetered on the edge of pornography, as they always should but rarely ever do. Kate Royal was the soloist, sumptuous and sensual, though dropping consonants all over the place and not doing nearly enough with the words. After this, the Mahler came almost as a shock. A number of conductors of late, most notably David Zinman and Markus Stenz, have redefined the Second in terms of spiritual grace and religious ritual. Petrenko, in contrast, went for extremes of emotional agony in the most violent performance of the work that I can remember. The omnipresent sense of threat lent it remarkable cogency and unity of purpose. Urlicht, sung by Catherine Wyn-Rogers, was querulous rather than serene, and the terrors only abated as the choral singing began to blaze nobly towards the end. Uncompromising stuff and hugely admirable, if at times difficult to like."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
