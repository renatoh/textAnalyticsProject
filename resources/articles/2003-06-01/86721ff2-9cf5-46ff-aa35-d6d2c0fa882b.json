The England captain was concerned that the welter of hype had overshadowed Real's run-in to the season in which they play Athletic Bilbao on Sunday in order to secure the league title. Some Real players, among them the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, the captain Fernando Hierro and the midfielder Guti, whom Beckham threatens to displace, have indicated they are less than impressed with the timing of the signing. \"I'd like to apologise to the Real players because this wasn't caused by me,\" said Beckham, who will sign on July 2. \"I didn't want it to detract from their last two games of the season as they fight for the championship.\" Beckham had watched Real's last match - the derby against Atletico, won by Madrid 4-0 - on television and thought his new team-mates had been \"pretty amazing\" but emphasised that he had yet to be promised a shirt or position. \"I haven't even discussed where I want to play,\" he said during a break from his promotional activities here. \"I've heard everyone saying that I want the No7 shirt. But I would never even dream of taking the No7 off of Raul. He is the king of Real Madrid.\" The soothing tone suggests that Beckham wants to get off on a better foot with his new club than the one on which he left Manchester United. His departure came after persistent stories of discord between himself and Sir Alex Ferguson. \"Things went on that, of course, I'm not happy about,\" Beckham said yesterday. \"After the clubs came to an agreement on the money side, it was my decision. For me, it was a good decision. If I was going to leave Manchester United at any point in my career then it would only be to a massive club like Real Madrid.\" Later, though, he issued a statement saying that it was not the case he was unhappy \"and I did not mean to give that impression in any way\". He denied reports that his agents had been talking to the Spanish club behind the scenes for months. Asked about his ability to speak in the language of his new home, he said he knew how to ask for the bill in a restaurant. Before the move, he said he had consulted England's coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, who had reassured him that, wherever he played, his position as captain of the national team would not be affected. \"I wouldn't have done it if it affected my England career. I spoke to Eriksson about it all because England is an important part of my career.\" He will have a medical in Spain on July 1 before officially becoming a Madrid player the following day. Before his new team flies here for a friendly in August, Beckham says he will make a proper farewell to United's fans. \"I'll miss the fans and the players that I've grown up with. I regard the players at Manchester as a family. I've got a lot of special friends there who have been kind to me for 13 years,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be right to leave them without saying goodbye. I owe them a lot.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
