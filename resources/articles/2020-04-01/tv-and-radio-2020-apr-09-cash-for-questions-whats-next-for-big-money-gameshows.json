After about 250 attempts and a huge bill, I made it.\u201d On 20 November, Keppel became the first person to win the show in the UK and leave with \u00a31m. Her winning question was \u201cWhich king was married to Eleanor of Aquitaine?\u201d (the answer is Henry II). \u201cWinning absolutely changed my life because, at the time, I was worried about money since I was in between jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter the win, the media response was huge and I was asked to do all sorts of funny things like open flower shows and then I was offered Eggheads in 2003, which is what I\u2019ve been doing ever since.\u201d At its peak, the year before Keppel\u2019s win, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was bringing in 19 million viewers per episode. \u201cWith Millionaire, we had our Concorde moment,\u201d the gameshow producer and quiz writer David Bodycombe says, \u201cit was the largest prize we\u2019d seen on British TV and it was pulling in the biggest ratings as a consequence. It\u2019s been difficult to know where to go from there in terms of rewards for contestants.\u201d Ever since the BBC launched its first televised gameshow, Spelling Bee, in 1938, the prize-winning format has been a staple of the nation\u2019s viewing habits. The development of aspirational materialism in the 50s led to a spike in shows with seemingly glitzy new offerings, including popular iterations such as Double Your Money \u2013 with an initial cash prize of \u00a31,000 \u2013 and Take Your Pick. In subsequent decades, TV personalities cemented viewerships for shows such as The Generation Game with its host Bruce Forsyth and Blankety Blank with Terry Wogan. Early prizes were middling at best, though, ranging from the holidays and household appliances of The Generation Game to the bizarre chequebook and pen in Blankety Blank. Much of this was owing to broadcast restrictions that came into force after the \u201cquiz share\u201d scandal in the US in 1958, where producers helped contestants to win big money prizes, placing a \u00a31,000 cap on the value of prizes on British shows from 1960. This increased to \u00a36,000 by 1981, but it wasn\u2019t until the restriction was scrapped altogether in 1993 that the money could rise to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? levels. The 00s then saw a brief leap forward, with producers competing with Millionaire to offer \u00a31m on shows such as Poker Face, the Vault and Red or Black, leading to big winners including Graham Fletcher, who picked up \u00a31.5m on Red or Black and Sarah Lang who won \u00a31m on Poker Face. Yet, the years since have seen offerings drop off a cliff, with Davina McCall\u2019s The Million Pound Drop plummeting to The \u00a3100k Drop in 2018, Tipping Point only offering a \u00a310,000 prize and a revamped Supermarket Sweep giving contestants the chance to win just \u00a33,000. Since washing machines and microwaves don\u2019t quite inspire the same level of awe as they might have done in the 60s and 70s prize hauls, why are people still lining up to get on to TV gameshows? David St John holds the world record for having appeared on the most British gameshows \u2013 34 between 1982 and 2013. \u201cYou never forget your first time,\u201d St John says. \u201cI remember getting on Sale of the Century with Nicholas Parsons and winning two Honda mopeds back in 1983. Since then I\u2019ve been addicted.\u201d St John estimates that in his decades spent quizzing, he has won about \u00a315,000. \u201cYou have to do it just for the fun of it because you can\u2019t really win that much,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody wants their 15 minutes of fame since it\u2019s still a major achievement to get on TV but when it comes to gameshows, it\u2019s all about skill.\u201d For St John, his \u201choly grail\u201d show to compete on is Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. \u201cYou have to have talent to get on a quiz show, as opposed to reality TV where you have to just make an omelette or something,\u201d he says, \u201cand the quizzing level has really improved in recent years with shows like Only Connect, so now it\u2019s even tougher.\u201d Keppel puts her own win down to luck, as well as knowledge. \u201cI was so lucky I didn\u2019t get any questions on sports or soaps,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause even with answers that you might know, under the studio lights you can buckle so easily.\u201d To add to the pressure, Keppel\u2019s winning round had a five-day gap in between filming sections, since she was the third contestant and so ran out of time during the live taping of her opening rounds. \u201cMy heart was thumping all week and all I could do to calm myself was go on long walks,\u201d she says. \u201cIt shows you how much confidence Charles Ingram must have had to go on cheating so obviously when he did.\u201d That notorious incident is now the subject of an ITV dramatisation, Quiz. Starring Michael Sheen as Millionaire presenter Chris Tarrant and Matthew Macfadyen as Ingram, it tells the story of army major Ingram\u2019s 2001 appearance on the show and winning of the top prize with the aid of an audience accomplice who coughed when the correct options were read out. Cheating notwithstanding for the participants, the former gameshow contestant and current Egghead Lisa Thiel believes it is the sofa play along element of gameshows that keep them so enticing to viewers. \u201cPeople love seeing others under pressure and thinking they could do it better themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cI applied for the Weakest Link when I was just out of university since I wanted to be famous and win some money. Of course, I did neither; as soon as they started taping, my knees were shaking and I had to hang on to the podium to make sure I was even standing.\u201d Thiel ultimately, like St John, believes the thrill of playing has to overcome the generally poor prizes \u2013 \u00a35,000 is the most ever won on the regular UK version of the Weakest Link. \u201cYou have to find something else that people are willing to compete for,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople still want to go on telly for the glory of it, to be with Bradley Walsh on the Chase or Richard Osman on Pointless.\u201d For the prizes, though, Keppel thinks there now needs to be a new goal for Millionaire. \u201cThey need to jump the prize to \u00a35m \u2013 that feels like a new, life-changing amount,\u201d she says. While Bodycombe thinks that with more than 60 gameshows being produced every year, cash is no longer king in making formats stand out. \u201cThere\u2019s been several rumours of shows giving away trips to space. That could potentially be the next big frontier for gameshow winners.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
