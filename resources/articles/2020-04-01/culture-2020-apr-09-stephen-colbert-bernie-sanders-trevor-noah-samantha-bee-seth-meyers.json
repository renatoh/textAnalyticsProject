Later in the show, Colbert phoned Sanders for his first interview since ending his campaign. Sanders, isolating at home in Vermont, thanked his grassroots supporters and volunteers and explained the rationale behind dropping out. \u201cThe mathematics is pretty clear that I can\u2019t win,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while you can make the argument that you should run a campaign, fight for your ideas, bring people together even if you can\u2019t win, I think the pandemic that we are experiencing right now makes even that virtually impossible.\u201d Asked if he had spoken with Joe Biden, now the presumptive nominee, Sanders said: \u201cIt\u2019s no great secret that Joe Biden\u2019s politics are different than mine. But I have known Joe since I came to the Senate in 2006, worked with him when he was vice-president in the Obama administration.\u201d As he had earlier in his address to supporters, Sanders called Biden a \u201cdecent human being\u201d and added: \u201cI hope to be able to work with Joe to move him in a more progressive direction.\u201d Sanders added that Biden is a \u201cgood politician\u201d who \u201cunderstands that in order to defeat the president, that in order to defeat Trump, he\u2019s going to need to bring new people into his political world and that he\u2019s going to have to listen to their needs\u201d \u2013 young people, working people \u2013 and \u201cstart moving in a different direction, to some degree, than he has in the past.\u201d \u201cIs that a full-throated endorsement of Joe Biden?\u201d Colbert asked. The host smiled as Sanders dodged the question: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be talking to Joe and we are talking to his team of advisers,\u201d he said, and repeated his promise to do \u201ceverything that I can to make sure that Donald Trump is not re-elected\u201d. Trevor Noah On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed how coronavirus is striking black Americans the hardest \u2013 for example, in Michigan, African Americans make up 14% of the state population but 41% of coronavirus deaths; in Chicago, black people make up 72% of deaths but just 30% of the population. Even Trump has noticed, saying at a press conference: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u201cIt almost sounds like Trump is jealous that black people get coronavirus more than anyone else,\u201d said Noah, \u201cjust because of the way he said it \u2013 \u2018How come black people are getting it, and not me? What do they have that I don\u2019t have? Is it swag?\u2019\u201d He was of course joking, Noah clarified, because \u201cif anything, it\u2019s refreshing to see President Trump so concerned about the black community. But when he says it doesn\u2019t make sense that coronavirus is hitting black Americans the hardest \u2013 it\u2019s actually the opposite. Because when you look at the systemic and economic factors facing black people in America, it makes complete sense.\u201d Black people are overall less likely to have health insurance, more likely to have pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, and more likely to be in service jobs without work-from-home options. \u201cAnd of course, there\u2019s always just straight-up racism that affects black people as well,\u201d Noah said, such as implicit bias leading doctors to discount symptoms. \u201cSo while almost every industry around the world is shut down, it looks like racism is still considered an essential service.\u201d Samantha Bee As the coronavirus crisis extends into another month, \u201cthe Trump administration has been busy abusing their power and pulling some truly shady shit while we\u2019ve all been busy crafting masks out of our underwear,\u201d said Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. Bee presented a distressing list of changes: rollbacks of EPA regulation and emission standards, and more abuses of power at Ice, \u201cthe least necessary government agency since the Bureau of Cassette Tapes and LaserDiscs\u201d. \u201cIce decided that since everyone isn\u2019t terrified enough right now, they should keep doing raids while people are stuck at home,\u201d Bee said, noting how agents in Los Angeles had made arrests on the first night of California\u2019s lockdown. \u201cHow is it essential to separate families during a health crisis? The only separation that desperately needs to be done right now is separating my hair from my body. I\u2019ve been a mess since my waxing place closed. \u201cTrump has also used the virus as an excuse to try to slash taxes, make the cuts to the federal interest rate that he already wanted to and to advance anti-union efforts,\u201d Bee continued, which is \u201cthe most work he\u2019s ever done. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say this but someone please find a way to sneak him on to a fucking golf course! \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to think about anything other than our families, our friends or what our tits will look like after months of not wearing a bra,\u201d Bee concluded, \u201cbut unfortunately, we have to. What our government does right now will have a lasting impact on all of us, long after this pandemic is over.\u201d Seth Meyers \u201cSeems like almost every day we get more and more evidence that the Trump administration knew well in advance of the very real threat of a pandemic, and that they both ignored it and lied to the American people about it,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night. He showed a series of clips in which Trump claimed the pandemic was impossible to predict, such as: \u201cNobody knew there\u2019d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.\u201d \u201cSo nobody could see this coming,\u201d Meyers deadpanned. \u201cYeah, Taiwan and South Korea and New Zealand and Singapore were all surprised. That\u2019s why they have a combined total of 12,000 cases and we have a total of 400,000 cases. \u201cDespite Trump\u2019s repeated claims that no one could have foreseen this, it turns out a lot of people foresaw this,\u201d Meyers continued and listed the times Trump was warned about the pandemic: \u201cFirst, Obama officials walk Trump aides through a global pandemic exercise in 2017. Then, in 2017 and 2018, threat assessment intelligence analysts even mentioned a close cousin of coronavirus by name, saying it had pandemic potential. Then in 2018, the director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the national security council told a symposium that the threat of pandemic flu is our number one health security concern. Then, top administration officials said last year that the threat of a pandemic kept them up at night. Then, White House economists warned in 2019 a pandemic could devastate America. Then, intelligence reports warned of a coronavirus crisis as early as November. And then, US intelligence reports from January and February warned about a likely pandemic. \u201cWell, you know, the saying: eight strikes and you\u2019re out,\u201d Meyers concluded. \u201cSeriously, how many incredibly specific warnings do you need?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
