But we do have some answers. We know a collection of technical specs: the new console will include a custom CPU, based on the Zen 2 architecture created by AMD, a well as GDDR6 Ram, a fast new standard of internal memory, and even an SSD for internal storage, the first time a traditional console has moved from the cheaper spinning disc platters of the PS4 and Xbox One. We know some of what that means for players. The console will push positively ludicrous numbers of pixels, enabling 8K resolution \u2013 that\u2019s 7680 \u00d7 4320 pixels, and, despite the name, roughly four times the resolution of a 4K screen \u2013 at 120 frames per second. It also supports high-end graphics features such as ray-tracing for the first time, bringing ultra-realistic lighting effects to home consoles. More prosaically, the combination of the SSD, CPU and memory should slash loading times, promising an end to staring at slowly filling progress bars. We also know a small bit about why Microsoft is doing this. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remove all the barriers from game developers to deliver on their creative vision,\u201d Jason Ronald, the director of product marketing at Xbox, says shortly after the public briefing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of feedback from developers: \u2018Here\u2019s my vision, and I need this much creative power to be able to do it.\u2019 That really shaped the design of Project Scarlett.\u201d And we know, lastly, a release window: \u201cHoliday 2020.\u201d For at least another 18 months, the current generation remains current. Perhaps that\u2019s why Microsoft is so stubbornly sticking to those small fragments of information. What will Project Scarlett look like? We don\u2019t know. How much will it cost? No answer. What about the further tech specs: how many cores in the new CPU, how much of that delicious GDDR6 Ram, how large will the SSD be? Don\u2019t bother asking. In fact, Microsoft won\u2019t even be drawn on perhaps the most important question of all: is Scarlett really the next generation, or is it an update of the current generation? The only game confirmed to be coming to the Scarlett, Halo Infinite, is also being released on the Xbox One, and Mike Ybarra, Microsoft vice-president of Xbox, would not commit to whether or not there would be such a thing as Scarlett-exclusive games down the line. Instead, he said, Microsoft\u2019s goal was \u201cto give gamers the choice, price points, and flexibility to play the games that they can\u201d. Halo Infinite will be on Xbox One and on Scarlett, so \u201cthey\u2019ve taken the creative choice to say, \u2018We know how to scale that game so it looks best on those devices\u2019\u2026 We want to listen to the developers and let them make the decision on what they think their assets need to run best, and empower them to make that choice.\u201d This is an odd dodge when it seems likely that the answer will be the same as it has been for every previous generation. Even if Scarlett launches with a plethora of games built both for Xbox One and the new machine, it will eventually see its own exclusives, as developers tire of trying to cram ever more expansive, and expensive, games into the dating hardware of the Xbox One. But Scarlett is only one half of Microsoft\u2019s strategy for the future of video games: the other half, Project xCloud, the company\u2019s nascent game-streaming system, which was also playable at E3, is all about liberating video games from black boxes under the TV, letting players stream any game to any screen and offloading the necessary processing power to the cloud. Perhaps, in that sense, there won\u2019t be any such thing as a Project Scarlett exclusive in the future: it might just run the same games better than other options. The new mantra, delivered repeatedly, is \u201cThe games you want, with the people you want, anywhere you want\u201d. The console, Microsoft is saying, isn\u2019t the point any more: sure, you can play Halo Infinite on the Scarlett, but if you want to play it on the older Xbox One, you can. And if you want to play it instead on Project xCloud, you can do that instead. The intention is clear: Microsoft wants everyone to play its games, whether they have a new Xbox, an old one, or even no Xbox at all. The company is finally ploughing real money into its PC gaming division, as well as enabling people to play console-quality games on their mobile phone through streaming. Nonetheless, there is clear excitement about the possibilities that the power of Scarlett will bring to the table. Ybarra describes it as \u201cthe biggest generational leap, from an experience standpoint, that we\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. For the time being, however, the message is that if you want the absolute best \u2013 if you\u2019re the sort of person with an 8K screen already (current price: \u00a32,800), and a desire for all your games to look nothing short of jaw-dropping \u2013 then Scarlett is for you. But, if you just want to play \u201cany game, anywhere\u201d, your old console will have legs for a good few years to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
