David Adeang, the Nauru justice minister, was responding to calls for greater access to the country. Nauru allowed Chris Kenny, associate editor of the Australian, on to the island earlier this month, the first visit by a foreign reporter for 18 months. Kenny acknowledged his support for offshore detention may have helped secure his visit. \u201cMany Australian media outlets and journalists have no respect for Nauru or our culture or people,\u201d Adeang said. \u201cNauru has no obligation to answer to Australian media. \u201cThe Australian media approaches us with great arrogance and an air of racial superiority, which is highly offensive to us. \u201cThey do not show us the respect of a sovereign nation and in return we have little respect for them.\u201d Adeang accused journalists of failing to question the claims of \u201crefugee advocates and Australian lawyers\u201d. \u201cThe truth is that despite the difficulties many refugees face and the lack of certainty they feel about the future \u2013 and we acknowledge that \u2013 Nauru is safe, refugees are not being raped, they have freedom, many are happy and making the best of their situation, and life on Nauru is peaceful with locals and refugees living, in the main, harmoniously. \u201cBut this truth doesn\u2019t suit the activist journalists. They need to paint a different picture to justify their political agendas and their own lack of fact-checking and poor journalism.\u201d On Wednesday Peter Dutton, the immigration minister, said that Abyan, the refugee who is pregnant after an alleged rape on Nauru, would return to Australia for medical treatment. On the same day, the annual general meeting in Sydney of Transfield Services, which manages Australia\u2019s offshore detention centres on Manus and Nauru, was disrupted by protesters opposing the company\u2019s work in the centres. Guardian Australia has been repeatedly refused access to the island. Nauru police have twice raided the offices of Save the Children at the Nauru detention centre after the government was angered by a report in Guardian Australia quoting an email from the operations manager at the centre. Save the Children said there was no evidence the leaked email had come from any of their staff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
