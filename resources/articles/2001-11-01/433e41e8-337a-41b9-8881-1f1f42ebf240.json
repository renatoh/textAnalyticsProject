In a speech to be delivered today to the annual conference of the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the umbrella body for national sports associations, Caborn will call for a streamlining of the way sport is administered and insist that there are too many governing bodies competing against each other. \"In this day and age you need to have people with skills to run sport,\" Caborn said. \"No one has ever taken them on. Public money is given out and we do not even know what we get back. \"We have to modernise and make sporting structures more efficient. Many of these people involved in sporting bodies do not have the ability to run them and this has held back our development. This is not about being negative, it is about modernising.\" In his first major policy speech, Caborn will also outline a major restructuring for Sport England, the organisation that distributes lottery money. Caborn claims that the organisation is too centralised and out of touch with the regions. As a result, he is to create nine regional boards, each of which will receive lottery money and be expected to deliver on grass roots and coaching facilities. The boards will be made up of local businessmen, sports officials and other experts. \"We need to refocus Sport England and have a greater strategy over the way sport is run,\" Caborn said. \"I want sport to be modernised. If we are serious about sport in this country then we need to take a fresh look at the institutions which run sport and modernise. At the moment, we don't know who the voice of sport is sometimes.\" \"So many sports have different governing bodies and all they are doing is competing with each other. Look at golf. It has more than 20 different governing bodies for different parts of the sport from the grass roots to the elite. Caborn is considered a specialist in grass-roots funding. Before becoming sports minister he was involved in the creation of the Regional Development Agency, which runs regional economic and regeneration programmes. Caborn is basing his reorganisation of Sport England along these lines. Calling on sport to pull together for the sake of greater development, Caborn said: \"I am determined to put my house in order by reforming Sport England and creating a bigger voice for sport in Whitehall. \"But we don't run sport, the governing bodies do, and unless the governing bodies get their house in order then we will never be able to effectively work together.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
