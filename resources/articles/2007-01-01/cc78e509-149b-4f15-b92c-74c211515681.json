In a major setback for China's efforts to replenish the endangered species with animals reared in zoos, Xiang Xiang has broken at least one bone and could be in danger, a leading Chinese zoologist said. \"Xiang Xiang has been badly hurt in a competition with other pandas,\" said Zhang Hemin, the director of the Research and Conservation Centre for the Giant Panda. \"We think he fell from a high place after being chased up a tree by a wild panda.\" The four-year-old panda was released into the forests of Sichuan province last April after being reared in China's main captive breeding centre at Wolong. It was the first step in a long-term programme to boost the 1,600-strong wild population with captive-bred mammals. During the first six months Xiang Xiang appeared to have adapted well. Tracked by satellite and regularly checked by monitoring teams, he put on weight and entered areas inhabited by wild panda communities without any apparent problem. But after making an initial diagnosis of the panda's wounds 15 days ago, scientists have been unable to make visual contact. \"We have found some problems, but we are still searching,\" said Mr Zhang. \"It used to be easy to find him, but now he is afraid of any noise and any person so it is very difficult.\" The team will decide whether to return Xiang Xiang for treatment in captivity or leave him in the wild for research purposes once they have made a fuller check on his condition. Even if he survives his injuries there is a risk that he could be unable to defend himself in conflicts with other males during the mating season, which is just a few months away. The injury looks likely to fuel a debate about the wisdom of the release programme. Supporters point to the success of captive breeding. Thanks to artificial insemination and techniques to encourage natural mating and rearing, the State Forestry Administration said a record 34 cubs were born in captivity last year. But international conservation groups such as WWF say the priority should be on protecting and expanding the habitat of the wild population."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
