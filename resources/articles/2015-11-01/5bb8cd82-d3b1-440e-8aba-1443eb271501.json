The girl, who cannot be named, accuses 15 men of sexually abusing her when she was 13 and 14 during a 13-month ordeal. Fourteen of the men, aged 17 to 62, are on trial at Bradford crown court. They deny a total of 28 charges between them. The jury on Wednesday was shown a police video interview of the girl filmed shortly after she was taken into care in June 2012. She detailed how the alleged abuse began when she befriended a young drug dealer called Arif Choudry, who effectively pimped her out to his friends in Keighley, West Yorkshire. The men, she claimed, raped her at various deserted locations, including in an underground car park, in parks, and behind a library and leisure centre. Choudry is not on trial, but she accuses him of raping her behind a church in Keighley after she tried to stop helping with his drug deals. She was 13, he was 15. For a period of months leading up to the alleged rape on 4 May 2011, she had been delivering drugs for him instead of going to school, she told a detective, listing marijuana, steroids, ecstasy, heroin, cocaine and mephedrone among the drugs she would deliver \u201con a daily basis\u201d. She insisted she never took drugs herself, but did it as a favour to Choudry, whom she described as a habitual cocaine and cannabis user. Choudry, the court heard, did not attend a mainstream school but was at a pupil referral unit for children with behavioural problems. On the video, she told police that when she tried to stop working for Choudry, he called her a \u201clittle white slag\u201d and a \u201clittle white bastard\u201d. He then pinned her to the ground and raped her, she said. \u201cI felt like crap, basically. Like shit. Because I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m doing him a favour, when really he\u2019s used and abused me,\u201d said the girl. She then described how she ran home to her great-grandma\u2019s house, where police were called. She admitted lying to officers initially, saying she had been raped by \u201ctwo white males\u201d and then retracted the allegation before she was supposed to undergo a medical examination, saying she didn\u2019t want everything to \u201cescalate\u201d. She also admitted lying about having an abortion in hospital afterwards, explaining her lies by saying: \u201cI was so pissed off as to what had actually happened I wanted to make it bigger than it actually was.\u201d The girl confessed on video to a further lie, having told police that she had withdrawn \u00a3160-\u00a3180 from her grandma\u2019s house under threat from Choudry. After her grandma reported the theft, the girl insisted Choudry had made her do it, threatening to \u201cget\u201d her sister if she didn\u2019t comply. But that wasn\u2019t true, she admitted to a detective in an interview filmed in October 2014. She didn\u2019t want to go into details, she said: \u201cI got myself wrapped up into a situation, but I don\u2019t want to talk about it at the moment.\u201d The girl, who is now 18, only disclosed that Choudry had been her first rapist when she was taken into care and told police he was just the first of a string of men to rape her \u2013 most of whom were introduced to her by Choudry. In another video the court heard how the girl had been made the subject of a police protection order on 15 May 2012, two weeks before she was taken into care. The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
