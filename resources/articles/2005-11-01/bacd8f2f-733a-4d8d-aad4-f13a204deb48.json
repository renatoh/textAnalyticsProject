Though the headline on later editions was changed to something slightly closer to the truth, the case to which it refers has sparked enough concern to prompt calls for public inquiries and law changes. The story relates to a rape trial in Swansea crown court in which a 21-year-old student alleged she was raped by a university security guard. The case collapsed after the woman admitted under cross-examination that she was too drunk to remember whether or not she had agreed to sex. The accused had insisted the sex had been consensual. Prosecution lawyers dropped the case, saying \"drunken consent is still consent\" and the judge directed the jury to bring in a not guilty verdict \"even if you don't agree\". Vera Baird QC, Labour MP for Redcar and a leading criminal lawyer, has called on the lord chancellor and the director of public prosecutions to look into the case. She said the law had been changed and the Sexual Offences Act 2003 now stated that no one could consent to sex except by choice, with \"the freedom and capacity to make that choice\". Welsh politicians have called for a further tightening of the law in light of the case so that the onus is placed on the accused to prove consent was given. Plaid Cymru assembly member Leanne Wood, a former chairwoman of Welsh Women's Aid, said: \"A woman should be able to get drunk if she wants to without fear of being raped. Men should not be given the impression that it is acceptable to have sex with a woman who is too drunk to consent.\" However, some contributors to website talkboards suggest that women must take responsibility for their actions, including how much they drink. And that to convict a man of rape is wrong when the alleged victim cannot remember whether or not she consented. The case follows close on the heels of a survey done for Amnesty International that shows a third (34%) of people in the UK believe a woman is partially or totally responsible for being raped if she has behaved in a flirtatious manner. Similarly, 30% of people said a woman was partially or totally responsible for being raped if she was drunk, and 37% held the same view if the woman had failed to clearly say \"no\" to the man. The survey prompted much debate in the mainstream media and blogosphere. Sarah Nicholson, a student who blogs under the name Musings of a Blonde, asks why so many people blame the victim? On the eve of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Julie Bindel said in the Guardian today that such violence was the cause of more deaths and disability around the world in 15- to 44-year-old women than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents or war. Comparing the British government's action on sexual violence to that on drink-driving or smoking, Bindel said nowhere near enough had been done. The most recent Home Office statistics show that in 2003 an estimated 50,000 women were raped in the UK, although just 11,867 went to the police. Of those cases, 1,649 went to trial but only 629 resulted in successful prosecutions. Some were unsuccessful despite the rapist pleading guilty. If you reported a rape in 2003 you had a 5.3% chance of securing a conviction. Voluntary agencies such as Rape Crisis say that figures, surveys and court cases such as those detailed above only serve to further prevent rape victims coming forward. Newspaper headlines might not help either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
