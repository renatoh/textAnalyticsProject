It\u2019s simple: massive inequality\u2019", "bodyText": "Penny Woolcock was born in Buenos Aires in 1950 and moved to Europe as a teenager. Her career spans art, film, TV and opera. Her fiction films, such as Tina Goes Shopping and 1 Day, often feature non-professional actors. Her documentaries include One Mile Away, which saw her brokering a truce between rival Birmingham gangs. She has directed operas ranging from Bizet\u2019s The Pearl Fishers to John Adams\u2019s Dr Atomic at New York\u2019s Met. Woolcock also directs the Yorkshire school drama Ackley Bridge, the third series of which is now on Channel 4. She lives in north London. What can we expect from this third season of Ackley Bridge? In a way, the underlying story is the same. It\u2019s about life in a small provincial town, where the Muslim community, which is generally depicted on telly as terrorists and paedophiles, is funny, resourceful, living their lives like all the rest of us. The series is saying the opposite of what you hear all the time, that we live in this very divided and divisive world. We can all really live together. I\u2019d never done anything prime time before. I tend to do things that go out at 11 o\u2019clock at night! But the idea of making something that had a 50% Muslim cast, and was looking with humour and humanity at working-class communities in the north of England \u2013 I just leapt at it, actually. Do you think Ackley Bridge has a knack for anticipating and reflecting the big issues in education? It\u2019s not preachy, but it does have stories about gender, sexuality, domestic violence. There\u2019s the strand about the school being an academy, and the subjects that children actually enjoy \u2013 art, drama, music \u2013 being cut. That\u2019s part of Michael Gove\u2019s vision, basically, and it\u2019s very, very hard on children who aren\u2019t academically gifted. What do you make of British politics at the moment? I think these are very dark days, I really do. I was filming in Halifax for three or four months, and do you know how often I heard anybody discuss Brexit? Never. Not once. I think there are huge swathes of England that have totally given up \u2013 and actually, I have. I don\u2019t want to listen to these dreadful people and their horrible ideas. You\u2019ve used local pupils in Ackley Bridge, and working with non-professional actors has been a feature of your career... I\u2019m not afraid of people \u2013 so perhaps that\u2019s a key thing. I also don\u2019t condescend. It also just makes it better: those kids are not acting, they\u2019re just being. You take your cues from them \u2013 I always go up to kids and say \u201cwhat music are you listening to now?\u201d They find it very amusing that I like grime. What are you listening to at the moment? Recently I\u2019ve been going on to [urban music website] GRM Daily and listening to Daily Duppy, it\u2019s basically freestyling with a lot of young rappers \u2013 J Hus, Abra Cadabra. A lot of the wordsmithing is really sophisticated, really clever. But it\u2019s also distressing because the stories are of people thinking violence and criminality is the only option they have. Musical developments such as drill music have been blamed for a recent wave of knife crime. How fair do you think that is? I think the music is telling us something that we should listen to \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s making those things happen at all. It annoys me when someone like Jay-Z or 50 Cent talk about how they\u2019re shotting [dealing] drugs on the street corner when they\u2019re multimillionaires. But when some kid is telling that story... it\u2019s an indictment of how we\u2019re marginalising young people. Do you have a sense of why we\u2019re seeing a rise in knife crime? It\u2019s really simple: it\u2019s massive inequality. For a start, why don\u2019t you invest in mental health services \u2013 a lot of the parents of these children are not well \u2013 and in youth clubs and services, which have been cut? It\u2019s really not rocket science You\u2019re also an opera director\u2026 People are sometimes surprised I like grime and opera. But they\u2019re telling you a story in the same way, and I like stories. And they\u2019re both very extreme: they can be very off-putting, so you have to surrender and be very open. I\u2019ve just come back from LA. I\u2019m developing an opera for 2020 with Wayne Shorter, the legendary jazz saxophone player; Frank Gehry the architect is designing the set and Esperanza Spalding is writing the libretto. It\u2019s the same mixture of chaos and creativity that you get anywhere. I don\u2019t like being in my comfort zone very much. I\u2019m also working on a feature film about a drug dealer, and a series about women\u2019s football. Is there any art form you haven\u2019t tried yet that you have in your sights? A grime album maybe? I can definitely say I would never become a grime artist! I\u2019d be rubbish at it. That, and ice skating. Ackley Bridge is on Channel 4 on Tuesdays, 8pm; the first two series are available on All 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
