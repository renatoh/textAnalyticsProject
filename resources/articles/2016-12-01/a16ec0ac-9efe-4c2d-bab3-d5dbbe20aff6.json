Comparing Theresa May's leadership style with Henry VIII's", "bodyText": "One was a famously autocratic Tudor monarch, the other is the Conservative prime minister, but who is the more effective leader? We compare Henry VIII and Theresa May\u2019s leadership styles. 1. Approach to Europe Henry effected the original split with Europe, ending rule by the church in Rome in order to secure a divorce from his wife. May will echo that break when she delivers the outcome of the referendum \u2013 taking the UK out of the EU \u2013 but hopefully without the excommunication and sectarian strife. 2. Treatment of enemies May is a master of the icy public putdown disguised as a joke, with targets including the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, David Cameron\u2019s former aide Craig Oliver and the former chancellor George Osborne. Henry preferred public executions. 3. Favourite sport Jousting, real tennis, archery, double-axe fighting: Henry enjoyed all manner of combative Tudor pursuits. May is more of a hillwalker, although she does follow cricket closely. While Henry enjoyed hunting deer, the prime minister has previously expressed support for repealing the foxhunting ban. 4. Christmas dinner Popular history says Henry VIII was one of the first people to enjoy a turkey at Christmas, stuffed with other birds for a decadent royal feast. May has revealed she prefers to cook a traditional goose, saving the fat for roasting potatoes. 5. Clothing style May has a bold fashion sense, including a penchant for leopard print shoes, and wore a \u00a3995 pair of gold leather trousers to an interview. Henry was more of a crimson and purple velvet ruler, from his floppy hats to his ermine-fringed robes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
