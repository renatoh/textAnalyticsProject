On this staid occasion, Trump also bashed two of his fellow Americans \u2013 the military veteran Robert Mueller, who oversaw the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. In an interview with Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham, taped near the Normandy American cemetery where 9,000 US veterans are buried, Trump said Mueller had \u201cmade a fool out of himself\u201d last time he testified before Congress. Mueller was deployed to Vietnam with the US marines in 1968 and suffered a gunshot wound there. Trump received a deferment from Vietnam for bone spurs. The president also criticized Pelosi, who was in Normandy with a congressional delegation commemorating the D-day anniversary. \u201cNancy Pelosi \u2013 I call her \u2018Nervous Nancy\u2019 \u2013 Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019s a disaster. She\u2019s a disaster. Let her do what she wants, you know what? I think they\u2019re in big trouble.\u201d When asked about the president\u2019s comments, Pelosi upheld an unwritten rule about not smearing political opponents in public while abroad. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about the president while I\u2019m out of the country,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThat\u2019s my principle.\u201d She added she hoped the president would \u201cconvey a renewed spirit of collaboration\u201d with allies. In Thursday\u2019s ceremony at Normandy American cemetery, many national leaders stressed the alliances that led to D-day. Trump focused on the valor of the men who stormed the beaches, and also sought to reassure allies who have been rattled by his \u201cAmerica first\u201d mindset. \u201cThose who fought here won a future for our nation. They won the survival of our civilization, and they showed us the way to love, cherish and defend our way of life for many centuries to come,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo all of our friends and partners our cherished alliance was forged in the heat of battle, tested in the trials of war and proven in the blessings of peace. Our bond is unbreakable,\u201d he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
