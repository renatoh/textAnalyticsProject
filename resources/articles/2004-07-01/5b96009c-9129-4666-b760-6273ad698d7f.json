While obligations exist to safeguard their interests, in reality they are perfectly capable of looking after themselves. Of course, this does not stop them from calling in their moral and financial dues when the mood and circumstances suit them. The board of Marks &amp; Spencer, right now, may feel the need for a bit of parental guidance. Philip Green, the noisy, canny stalker, railed at the capriciousness of M&amp;S's leading shareholders soon after he first revealed his interest in buying the company. At 290p a share, before he had showed his hand, the company's prospects were widely considered dim and its shares were treading water. Suddenly, with Green on the scene, shareholders were demanding at least 400p for their shares. Psychology Where's the logic in that? Green feigned not to know. His advisers will have given him a lesson in the psychology of fund managers and the nuances required of takeover tactics if they are to win over professional shareholders. Green's first response had an air of churlishness, as if he was reluctant to concede much to the investors who had so suddenly rediscovered the value in a share which had been languishing in their portfolios. At 370p he failed to win their hearts and minds. Now, at 400p a share, he at least temporarily has them in his lobby. Green's third indicative bid has the public backing of two major institutional shareholders - Brandes in America and Schroders in Britain. The former, with an 11.9% shareholding, is the largest single investor in M&amp;S. It had been selling shares in the market since the bid battle began, so it is little surprise that it has given a soft commitment to Green. Schroders' holding, at 1.2%, is far smaller, but as a blue chip player in the British asset management industry its vocal support is symbolically significant. Both Brandes and Schroders have committed to the Green bid on the condition - Green's own - that it receives the endorsement of the M&amp;S board. For Green it is not the endorsement that is so important as the ability to gain access to non-public details on the M&amp;S business. This \u00a39.1bn adventure is to be funded by a substantial slug of debt, leaving little room for nasty surprises when the doors to the M&amp;S storerooms are flung open. Better to try and poke around them before committing oneself irrevocably. M&amp;S must be exasperated at the actions and comments of its shareholders - a number of others displaying a softer line towards Green now that he has nudged up to the 400p level. It was only six weeks ago that Stuart Rose's sudden appointment as chief executive was being hailed as justifying breathing space for M&amp;S to prove its worth. Although being cleared by the Financial Services Authority of any wrongdoing in his trading of M&amp;S shares, Rose has not come out of the blizzard of spin well in recent weeks. However, one must assume he is the same retailer today as he was on the day of his appointment. Green's latest offer has been well timed and finely judged. On Monday Rose will reveal his plans for the company under his command. Analysts must be able to place a substantial premium on his vision for the 400p dangled by Green to appear unattractive. Green's bid has not been formally tabled and might be undermined by discoveries in any due diligence process. But Rose would also have to deal with any nasties, so they could hardly constitute a defence. There will undoubtedly be a couple of rabbits plucked from M&amp;S's hat on Monday - there simply must be - but in all likelihood they won't be sufficient to drive the company's share price to within touching distance of the Green offer. We can then expect a protracted period of lobbying from shareholders of the M&amp;S board in an attempt to make them take Green seriously. Opportunity In time it is likely to cave in. What, then, might Rose do? He may feel let down by his board. He might also see that as his opportunity to seek its permission to mount his own management buyout in competition with Green. Rose may have worked at M&amp;S in the past but, as an emergency recruit, he can't be expected to be wedded to its long-term existence as a publicly quoted company. This may be Rose's big chance, but not of the type originally envisaged. If, through their capriciousness, shareholders manage to engineer competing leveraged bids from two great rival retailers for M&amp;S then they really will have done right by their own investors. The M&amp;S board, however, would feel like downtrodden parents everywhere. \u00b7 Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group edmond.warner@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
