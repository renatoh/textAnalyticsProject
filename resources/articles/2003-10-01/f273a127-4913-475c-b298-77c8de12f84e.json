This is a stunning production of a play that survives only in fragments - much of it not Shakespeare's handiwork. It would be good not to have to accept any substitutes - but necessary liberties have been taken: George Wilkins's The Painful Adventures of Pericles, Prince of Tyre (1608), is here employed to patch, if never invisibly to mend, the whole. Bartlett works within the contrivances of the plot - enjoying its quirks - and yet creates a clearing within which Shakespeare's emotional climaxes are never obscured. Take Act Three - and the horror of the opening scene in which Pericles's wife Thaisa (winningly played by Sarah Malin) dies in childbirth on a ship. Pericles has not seen her since their daughter was born nor begun to weep for her before - for health and safety reasons - his crew insist he cast her overboard. This ghastly scene is made real by the sight of his wife wheeled in to him on a high bed, her white nightdress flowering with her blood. She is uncompromisingly present - and already absent. And when later, the more challenging scene unfolds in which she turns out not to be dead at all - washed up in a coffin scented with spices - this also is played in a hyper-real way, with a medical team in white coats attendant on her. Clinical decisions are taken. But her revival is moving because of its impossibility - I wept as death was gradually, lyrically reversed. Bartlett is responsible, too, for the enigmatic design, a set that appears to be the landing of a hospital (a chic one, with grey walls and black double doors) and the deck of a ship - a dreamed place. The set is perfect for a play that is a kind of reverie; there were many moments so beautiful I would like to have said: 'Stop! Let's see that again.' And there were points when - as if anticipating such a reaction - the actors did freeze. When Thaisa's father, Simonides (deli ciously smarmy Martin Turner) agrees to the marriage between Pericles and his daughter and invites them to dance, they take up a position in each other's arms but do not move. The dance does not begin. It is a moment in which their present and future are held together - suggestive of initial strangeness and of intimacy to come. Three actors, in an excellent cast, stand out: Pascale Burgess's Marina is like an ardent nun - all gawky angles but with a pure, pale face. Bette Bourne is an original and diverting Gower, a lecturer/narrator who instructs us from a blackboard and who also, hilariously, doubles as a bookie, taking bets on Thaisa's suitors (the production is full of witty detail). As Pericles, Will Keen, in gold pyjamas, has glamour and intensity. And while it is shocking to see him dwindle into an in-patient of Blakean aspect (pyjamas replaced by sorry dressing-gown) we already know that, in this play at least, while there is a 'working pulse', there's hope. Another boat was afloat last week: an ocean liner setting out on a far-from-maiden voyage.Trevor Nunn's sublime National Theatre production of Anything Goes has found its sea legs at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The white ship still resembles a tiered wedding cake and the showmanship of the evening is as glorious as ever, especially the moment in which the ship/cake revolves to reveal the orchestra playing on its upper deck. In the smaller auditorium, the show feels less majestic but more intimate: from the stalls, it is possible to count the buttons on each fabulous sea-faring outfit (the work of maestro costume designer Anthony Powell). Sally Ann Triplett's Reno Sweeney is still 'the top' - holding the show together - and giving Cole Porter's songs the red sequin treatment - with unflagging exuberance. Simon Day's Evelyn Oakleigh is killingly funny (though his aristocratic laugh - like a faulty waste disposal unit - isn't quite as perfect as once it was). Mary Stockley's Hope Harcourt still looks like a marvellous swan. The sailors are anything but plain sailing - and John Barrowman's Billy Crocker is still hitting the high notes - looking like a younger and more hopeful version of Tony Blair. Barrie Ingham does well, too, as the new old boy in the cast - sadly replacing the late Denis Quilley as Elisha Whitney. Life is Rhythm is one of the most eccentric pieces I've ever seen in the West End. A troupe of five men, the Camut Band, look as if - supposing they weren't performing - they might be propping up a bar in a Spanish village. These virtuoso tap dancers and percussionists (their show was a hit in Edinburgh) are keen to make an impression on more than the floor. They do much of their work on top of giant drums. The resulting noise sounds like the charge of the heavy brigade: hundreds of horses bolting from their stables together, the patter of not-so-tiny feet. It is like a low-budget version of the hit dance show Stomp , minus the dustbin lids. But what are they banging on about? Rhythm rules, they want us to know. In the most entertaining sketch, three men talk gibberish together to show how rhythm governs conversation and reveals personality. I couldn't help wishing for moments in which Life might turn out to be Silence. But the Camut Band got a great rapport with the audience and gave us all a lesson in clapping. \u00b7 Susannah Clapp is away"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
