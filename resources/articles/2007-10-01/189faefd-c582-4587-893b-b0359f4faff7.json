By the close of the Interlagos Grand Prix, at around 7pm tonight, one of Dennis's drivers - Lewis Hamilton or Fernando Alonso - should become McLaren's first world champion for eight years. Yet because of the notorious 'Spygate' episode earlier this year - the sport's biggest ever scandal, provoked by the revelation that former Ferrari race technical manager Nigel Stepney had passed on information about its car to a McLaren employee - there will be no constructors' championship for the team. The team was excluded from the championship and also had to pay a staggering $100m fine for its involvement. To add to Dennis's woes, he has also had to deal with the season-long in-fighting between his two star drivers, a situation that has severely tested his man-management abilities. It all means that however much the 60-year-old former mechanic may celebrate if the rookie Hamilton or double world champion Alonso wins the title, it has been a highly mixed year for a man rated as F1's supreme operator.' Born in Woking, Dennis attended a vehicle technology course at Guildford Technical College before becoming a junior mechanic with the now defunct Cooper team in the summer of 1966, where he worked on the car of future F1 champion Jochen Rindt. Dennis had seen his first motor race at Brands Hatch five years earlier when he was 14, and had become instantly hooked on the endless flash and smell of grand prix racing, hanging around the Brabham factory in Byfleet, making the tea and offering to sweep up so that he could be near the F1 cars. He became chief mechanic to Sir Jack Brabham, the triple world champion, at just 21, at least a decade younger than his counterparts on the other F1 teams. When Brabham retired in 1971, Dennis formed his first team, Rondel Racing, with Neil Trundle, another mechanic. Although they had just \u00a31,000 for the start-up and the cars were acquired on hire purchase or borrowed, Dennis ensured his garage and transport lorry were immaculate. He performed so impressively that he attracted a driver of Graham Hill's calibre, a double world champion. Dennis, at that point, was still working on the cars. But then, a serious crash changed his life. Needing parts for Hill, an exhausted Dennis drove overnight to Woking, but fell asleep at the wheel of his E-type Jaguar. A punctured lung and severe facial injuries, including damage to his eyes, kept him hospitalised for weeks. 'When you cannot see or move, there is little else to do but think. People don't put themselves in a position where they switch the telephone off, close the door, sit down and [consider] things quietly. I had to,' he recalls. 'It meant, ultimately, that I couldn't do my old job, so I managed instead. But I was in heaven because I had a legitimate reason for not working with my hands, yet I revelled in the attention to detail that stood me in good stead for running this company.' In 1980, Dennis's company Project Four merged with Team McLaren to form McLaren International and embarked on a period of dominance. Dennis's big break had come when Marlboro realised his potential and brokered the merger. Then Mansour Ojjeh, a member of a wealthy Arab family of industrialists running the Technique d'Avant Garde (TAG) company, joined, which allowed further expansion. John Hogan was a senior executive at Philip Morris, the company that owns Marlboro. 'Two things impressed me about Ron. The first was his conviction that nothing was impossible. The second was his remarkable clarity of vision. Most people tend to think about next weekend, the next race or perhaps the next season. In Ron's case, it was about the next two, five, even 10 years. Everything you see in the McLaren pit today, the whole infrastructure, was clearly positioned in his mind back in the early Seventies.' Niki Lauda won the first world championship for Dennis in 1984. That title had come when the Austrian beat the great French driver Alain Prost by just half a point, at the close of a season in which the team-mates had won 12 of the 16 races, prefiguring the team-mate tussle of this year. This season, Alonso and Hamilton have each won four races, with the Briton taking full advantage of Dennis's policy - hardly the norm in the pit lane, where superstars have long been pandered to - of always awarding equal billing to his drivers. It is an ethos that, hardly surprisingly, has not pleased the brooding Alonso. The Spaniard's displeasure at the young debutant Hamilton's amazing start to his career was best illustrated by a threat made by the champion during the Spygate scandal that shattered the slick corporate image F1 tries so hard to cultivate. It emerged that Alonso had known about the Stepney incident before the story became public. Furious at not being awarded the number one status in the team, Alonso informed Dennis that he would tell the FIA, the sport's governing body, of the scale of McLaren's involvement unless Hamilton was sidelined. Although Alonso apologised for the threat and did not follow it through, Dennis's decision to inform the FIA ahead of the Turkish Grand Prix in August indicated he would not be bullied. It also appeared a canny move to limit any potential damage to the reputation of McLaren and himself. 'The decision I have is, do I appeal the fine? Does McLaren take a financial hit in the interests of the sport?' Dennis said, ever the politician, after the September verdict. 'I hope the other teams understand. The important thing is the company's integrity and the firm belief of the world that we have never competed with a car that has anybody else's technology in it. There is not more than one other team in the pit lane who can take a $100m hit.' He did not appeal. But there is no doubt that it has been the most uncomfortable episode for a company in which Dennis owns a 15 per cent share and he has strived so hard to make the dominant force of F1. McLaren's incessant eye for detail might be viewed as obsessive. His American wife Lisa certainly thinks it can be; there's a nice story told about him having the gravel on the drive of his Woking mansion taken away to be washed before being relaid. This focus also moved him to plot and save for years so that he could build his dream McLaren complex in Woking, which Dennis has described as 'an industrial Utopia for [his] workers'. Designed by Lord Foster, it cost an estimated \u00a3300m and was opened by the Queen in 2004. It employs around 1,000 people who produce Mercedes-McLaren SLRs (which sell at \u00a3313,000 apiece and for which there's a waiting list of a two-and-a-half years) as well as planning the next assault on F1. 'Over the years, I put money by for this project because I didn't want to go into debt. My philosophy has always been, \"If you can't afford two of anything, don't buy one,\"' he said a little disingenuously after saddling McLaren with a \u00a3100m overdraft. 'I had the vision of the factory years ago and bought up parcels of land near Dover. But when I gathered the workforce together, it quickly became clear few wanted to move to Kent. They were all happy living around Woking. That was something that hadn't occurred to me. 'I immediately started buying up land around the corner from our current factory so everyone would be content with this move.' But the question now, especially after the events of this season, is how long he will continue. 'If you make a load of money, own your own jet, have homes in the mountains of Colorado, the south of France and Surrey, plus three wonderful kids and a good-looking wife who mean everything to you, then it attracts a certain amount of envy,' he has said. He certainly wants more time with Lisa. In July, he admitted: 'The next 10 years I hope are going to be as active as the previous 20 and I want to be aggressively skiing, playing various sports - golf, scuba diving. But I'm conscious of the fact that the older you get, the longer it takes your bones to heal, so you have to be sensible. But when I do leave F1, it will be cold turkey.' He has, though, a more immediate issue. 'Spygate has left him in an awkward position,' says an F1 insider. 'He has been talking about walking away for a while now. He has the structure in place, but he can't leave at the moment because it would appear he was deserting when McLaren need him the most.' Dennis will have the broadest of grins today if Hamilton or Alonso does secure the title. But he then faces a post-season of rebuilding his and McLaren's reputation. It is certainly the kind of challenge upon which he thrives. The Dennis lowdown Born 1 June 1947 in Woking, Surrey. Married to Lisa, they have three children. Best of times Making McLaren the dominant force in F1 in the Eighties after just four years in charge. The team won seven drivers championships between 1984 and 1991. And building the McLaren complex in Woking, which he named Paragon, meaning 'centre of excellence'. Worst of times This season, when the renowned control freak lost control of his drivers and team. 'Alonso is not the man I imagined him to be, but that's the way it is,' Hamilton said. What he says 'My sympathy window, where I allow myself self-pity, lasts from the moment when I open my eyes in the morning to the point at which my feet touch the floor beside the bed. That lasts as long as I want it to...' What others say 'I've known Ron Dennis for 24 years. I've driven for and against him. I've stayed at his collection of beautiful homes. He makes a great friend who would always be there in time of need. On a business level, though, he often leaves me, like many, either seething with anger or full of admiration. 'He is much misunderstood, not always as good a communicator as he thinks, and far from universally popular in Formula One circles.'
