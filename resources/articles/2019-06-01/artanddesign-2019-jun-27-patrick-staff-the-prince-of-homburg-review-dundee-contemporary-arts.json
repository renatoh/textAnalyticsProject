London and LA-based artist Patrick Staff\u2019s new exhibition at Dundee Contemporary Arts deals with the widespread condition of exhaustion. Staff\u2019s practice explores ideas of discipline, dissidence, labour and the queer body. This show includes film, sculpture, installation and prints, built around German writer Heinrich von Kleist\u2019s play The Prince of Homburg, from which the show takes its title. Written in 1810 but set in 1675, Kleist\u2019s drama opens with a sleepwalking prince who, overcome with the burdens of war, half dreams and half lives a narrative of victory and love. Confused about what is real and what is not, the prince overrides his superior\u2019s commands on the battlefield and, despite winning the battle, is sentenced to die. Staff\u2019s exhibition takes Kleist\u2019s play as a starting point to think about exhaustion as a reaction to structural oppression and the abuses of power. Staff signals that to be spent is a political condition; a bodily, psychological and social experience used by the state as a means of control. Considering the potential of dreaming as a form of resistance, Staff places the night as a time of heightened queer relationality. For the artist, dreaming is not only an exit strategy, but also a means through which to conjure other possible realities. The exhibition is installed across two rooms; one with natural light, the other in darkness. Connecting both galleries is The Appetite, an aluminium fortification that runs across the top of the walls. From where the visitor stands, it is not clear whether we are in or out of the space the aluminium structure seeks to protect. Threateningly, items of clothing, flowers, candles, strands of LED lights and even chairs are caught in its sharp, barbed hooks. A series of photograms, made without a camera on light-sensitive paper, reveal objects \u2013 a chain, a scalpel, a glove \u2013 relevant to a film installed in a room with regal-red walls. Staff\u2019s three-part, 23-minute film mixes scenes seemingly witnessed by the eyes of the Prince of Homburg \u2013 snippets of wandering around a garden, dazing flashes between day and night \u2013 with interviews and sequences that involve a whole new cast. Singer-songwriter Macy Rodman candidly appears in her bedroom playing extracts from her song Lazy Girl, which describes negative perceptions of her tiredness while she was adjusting to the hormonal shift during her transition. Actor Debra Soshoux talks about the importance of recognising feelings of your gender beyond what is dictated by the physical body; and writer Che Gossett makes a poignant connection between sexual liberation and the erasing of gender norms as being in necessary tandem with the abolition of prisons. Filtered through Kleist\u2019s storyline, these interjections \u2013 plus others by writer Sarah Schulman and artists Nikita Gale and Nour Mobarak \u2013 open up questions of exhaustion in response to punishment, the significance of a politicised death, and the inflicting of violence towards practices of desire that sit outside normative, heterosexual, white, abled, cis consciousness. The day before Staff\u2019s exhibition opening, the Scottish government postponed its plans to update Scotland\u2019s gender recognition laws, failing to provide an easier and less wounding process for transgender people to change their legal gender. Staff\u2019s exhibition is an urgent reminder that the law, even more than 200 years after Kleist\u2019s world, forces certain bodies into greater strain than others. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 June 2019 because the Scottish government postponed, not retracted as an earlier version said, its plans to update Scotland\u2019s gender recognition laws."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
