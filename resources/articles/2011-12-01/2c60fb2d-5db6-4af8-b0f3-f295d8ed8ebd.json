Rupert has been very generous to Oxford. Every year, the university has a series of very distinguished practitioners as the News International visiting professor of broadcast media, including Armando Iannucci, Matthew Engel, Stewart Purvis and Paul Gambaccini in recent years. They give an erudite series of lectures in January/February to an equally distinguished, if ageing, audience at St Anne's and Green Templeton colleges. But, look at the English department calendar for January 2012 and there's nothing there \u2013 nil, nada. No News International professor in 2012? That would be a surprise. Anyone would think that the Murdoch brand is now so toxic that even those who enjoy his largesse are shying away. \u2022 With still more questions than answers, many agencies continue to review the England riots. Many things went awry in terms of the police response, including the catering. \"The choice of sandwich fillings came in for particular criticism,\" reports the London Police Federation journal Metline, relating views expressed by members. All that tuna, chicken and eggs, stored in hot vans. \"Not appetising.\" And, of course, there was the obvious risk of food poisoning. Could this be why there were few officers to be seen? \u2022 Desperation grips the right in the US, meanwhile, amid a lacklustre showing by those chasing the Republican nomination. With Herman Cain out of the running and stationed once again at his pizza oven, the frontrunner is the party's very own coconut-shy candidate Newt Gingrich. Such is the confidence he inspires, even among those who dearly want rid of Obama, that he has been offered $1m to drop out of the race. The offer comes from controversial broadcaster Michael Savage, who was banned from entering this country in 2009 on the basis of his Islamophobia and general unpleasantness. \"Take the money \u2013 and don't run,\" is his message to Gingrich. He says Newt is \"unelectable\"; hence the best challenge they could mount to President Obama would come from Mitt Romney \u2013 the other candidate no one wants. Heady days. \u2022 And with Saif Gaddafi still languishing in the west Libyan town of Zintan, awaiting trial, a few thoughts on his late father, the colonel. What was he thinking during those last dark days, when despite the obligatory roars of defiance he must have known the end was nigh and all was lost? He may have been thinking of Beaconsfield, in Buckinghamshire. He liked Beaconsfield. The film-maker Michael Cockerell uses an article in the latest Standpoint magazine to recount the adventures of the late \"brother leader\" in the town in 1966. Gaddafi was sent there as a young officer to attend the British Army School of Education. He ventured to London, indeed there is a single picture, reprinted therein, of Gaddafi in his flowing white robes, strolling down Piccadilly Circus. But he didn't like the bustle of the capital. \"I loved the country life and the villages,\" he said later. \"Beaconsfield and High Wycombe. I also visited the Palace of Windsor, it was beautiful.\" And Beaconsfield took to him: well, the army types anyway. \"He wasn't the most ghastly hooligan we'd seen,\" one senior officer told Cockerell. \"He gave us no reason to poison him.\" Praise indeed. \u2022 Finally, we remember the \"dear leader\", Kim Jong-il. And as the North Koreans prepare for a funeral, one wonders what they will do at Sellafield to mark his passing. For the bond was a direct one. When Kim was scurrying around for a plutonium production prototype \u2013 the better to advance his troublesome nuclear weapons programme \u2013 he looked and looked and couldn't find anything. But then he got lucky and found within the open scientific literature published by the UK Atomic Energy Authority, detailed blueprints of Britain's military reactors at Calder Hall on the site of what is now Sellafield. So he cloned it, the result being a five-megawatt electric, gas-cooled, graphite-moderated nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90km north of the capital Pyongyang. Like all good students, he knew where to turn for help and had no obvious qualms about copying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
