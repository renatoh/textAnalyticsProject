The Musical Parody review \u2013 cathartic pisstake is much more fun than the finale", "bodyText": "Making conversation before the curtains lift on the sold-out opening night of Thrones! \u2013 the Game of Thrones parody musical, which is in Australia following seasons in the US and UK \u2013 my seatmate side-eyes me conspiratorially and asks the only question: what did I think of the finale season? \u201cI felt it \u2026 could have benefited from a little more breathing room, story-wise,\u201d I say carefully, though I suspect this won\u2019t be a controversial take. As the show\u2019s second half roasts the final season as if it were a disloyal advisor, the gleeful shrieks of approval from the audience prove me right. Retaining some level of disappointment with the show\u2019s eighth season has now essentially replaced knowing all the character names (or having a particularly baroque \u201cR+L=J\u201d theory) as the key indicator of true GoT fandom. So this parody musical, which has been touring Fringe festivals and comedy circuits since 2015 \u2013 updated with new gags sometimes weekly to bring it up to speed with the show \u2013 has taken on a new responsibility. Director Chris Grace says that as this year\u2019s series was airing, the Thrones! team were writing spec songs and throwing around ideas; the moment the finale aired on 18 May, they dove into three hours of writing, and began rehearsals for the Sydney run the next day. Beginning as a cheeky tribute, the latest and possibly final incarnation of Thrones! has seen it morph into a retrospective that functions both as catharsis for the fans who saw years of theories and hopes go up in flames this year; and as a sneakily bleak send-up of anyone who got so invested in this absurdly over-resourced telenovela in the first place. The premise of the musical involves a group of GoT superfans using their recently divorced friend Linda\u2019s place for a surprise finale-viewing party, as she has the biggest TV. She has never actually seen the show, so they offer to re-enact it. \u201cThank god I brought my box of wigs!\u201d exclaims one. It starts off broad and more than a little stiff: I sank down in my seat a little at the prospect of sitting through 120 minutes of \u201cBoy, there sure are a lot of murders in this here prestige fantasy program!!!\u201d gags. But Thrones! is at its best when it really leans into the baby-stabbing, sister-fucking, eyeball-exploding, second-grader-ritual-sacrificing surreality, where the cast stare the audience down and dare them not to laugh at a toy foetus being repeatedly knifed as part of a rap number \u2013 after all, you watched this stuff for fun when it was being played straight, right? As the musical numbers explain plot landmarks like the Red Wedding (the aforementioned hip-hop interlude, titled \u201cStabbin\u201d) or the constant sexual violence (Ramsay and Joffrey in a cane-twirling vaudeville double act), poor, uninitiated Linda repeatedly emerges with her face contorted in horror at their content, asking semi-rhetorically why this is considered fun \u2013 a running gag that works for the musical and the series. And the broad stuff lands well, too: Jordan Stidham proves a bang-on Jon \u201cSnor\u201d Snow accent is never not funny, and reveals of iconic props like Jaime Lannister\u2019s golden hand are greeted with roars of delight. There are meme-y jokes that may only be funny if you already know about the photo of Sophie Turner Juuling in costume, or about Twitter thirsting conflictedly after the grown-up Robin Arryn the way the pre-teen Robin thirsted after breast milk, or about the two separate instances of non-Westerosi beverage vessels turning up in season eight. And there is a genuinely affecting Hodor \u2013 sorry, Willas \u2013 solo song that\u2019s played absolutely straight, as if to remind us that the last of the show\u2019s actual humanity was clawed to death by wights in an act of heroic \u2013 but, like literally the entire plot of the show, apparently pre-destined and thus possibly meaningless \u2013 self-sacrifice. Eric Michaud crushes everything from this lovely moment to a Hamilton\u2013style \u201cHow does a half-man \u2026\u201d Tyrion solo, and is the clear cast MVP, musically. Less successful is a lot of the topical humour, from a gratingly obvious Trump/Wall runner to some of the attempts to localise winky stuff about real-life monsters \u2013 if we\u2019re at the point of making George Pell Jokes, and I\u2019m not sure we are, they need to be cleverer than Joffrey claiming him as a \u201cfriend and mentor\u201d, as certain Aussie politicians actually did mere months ago. (I desperately, desperately wish to know how many people appreciated the Engadine Maccas shout-out, though.) GoT was an increasingly communal experience as its success grew, and the universality of its parting disappointments are the most uniting set of creative choices it has ever given us. There are very few who felt that the previous decade of wild mass guessing, and genuine emotional distress over the fates of their favourite characters, were done justice by the finale. Thrones! slyly reaches very hard for some greater meaning in the bloodshed and billion-dollar budget, but it\u2019s really just trying to prolong the fun \u2013 and if dodgy wigs and rhyme schemes fudged harder than Westerosi travel times sound like fun to you, it leaves the actual finale in the dust. \u2022 Thrones!
