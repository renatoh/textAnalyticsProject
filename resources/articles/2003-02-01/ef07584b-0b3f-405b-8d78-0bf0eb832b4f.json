In these times of trouble, we need it more than ever. But I have stopped taking the Observer since it came out as pro-war. I dislike the papers that eat up the government propaganda about terrorist attacks. I like reasoned coverage. Magazines: Subscribing is the important thing. You can tell a lot about a man from that. I get Sight and Sound, the Ecologist, Which?, and the New Statesman for my fix of dangerous leftwing views. I used to work for Emap, and can't stop buying Q and Empire to see how the old gang are getting along. I kept all my magazines and I just realised how many I have. I recycled all of them. Books: I've realised I'm against fiction - I just read facts. I'm always reading a biography of Hitler. I love Michael Moore - I could easily read Stupid White Men again. And I've just finished reading Knockout Annual 1973. The Super Seven were in it. TV: I'm a sucker for costume dramas. Andrew Davies is usually the benchmark. I watch Question Time as a spectator sport. I watch Happiness, cos I'm writing a sitcom at the moment. It's very brave and has beautiful camerawork. Radio: I can be one of those rare people who doesn't listen to the Today programme! I listen to 6 Music, where I work. On a Saturday, in the car, I listen to Ricky Gervais on XFM. I laugh out loud. Adverts: I agree with Bill Hicks - if you're in advertising, kill yourself. I hate things like \"Do you speak Micra?\" and \"Take the Actimel Challenge\". It's not a challenge, it's a little yoghurt drink! New media: I don't think a day goes by without me logging on to the Internet Movie Database. I sometimes go to a comedy forum called notbbc. \u00b7 Andrew Collins is a writer and broadcaster.
