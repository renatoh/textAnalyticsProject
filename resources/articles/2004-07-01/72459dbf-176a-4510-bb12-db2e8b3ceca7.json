Draft documents for the meeting highlight the results of three years of consultation with party members, and with the public through the Big Conversation. The paper on education does not even mention city academies or school uniforms, to take just two headlines from yesterday's announcement (Tradition at heart of school plan, July 9). Apparently these have little relevance or support among the thousands of contributions received. So why bother asking members or voters, if their views are so easily over-ridden by Downing Street?
