This was not only extravagant, but not good for family relationships. While I was on a business trip to America my wife telephoned to say she had found this potentially perfect house in which I could cut myself off to work in a garden-level room in the basement, while there would be space for her and the children upstairs, and even other members of our extended family. But this would be more expensive than we had planned, so we would have to pool our resources and settle for a more economical and sensible style of family life. Then soon after we moved in I fell and broke a leg, so there was no longer a question of my seeking refuge from my family in order to work, but rather of gratitude that they were indeed on top of me to look after me. During the last 10 years I have fallen and broken my other leg, so my need and gratitude have continued. And I now have my own bathroom and even kitchen on the garden-level floor, where it became obviously to everyone's advantage that in my disabled state I should sleep as well as work. And for the most part I can handle my own cooking when my wife Verity, who is a psychotherapist, is working upstairs. This sort of arrangement seems to make for ease in family life. I have surrounded myself with bits and pieces of folk-art that I have picked up from around the world. My wife attends nobly to what I cannot do for myself in my old age (I am 85); and our son Marius, when possible - he is himself now a father - cheerfully pushes me in my wheelchair. But I can get around by myself with two sticks in my own space, and can still work at my laptop on my desk if and when I like. I have been very lucky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
