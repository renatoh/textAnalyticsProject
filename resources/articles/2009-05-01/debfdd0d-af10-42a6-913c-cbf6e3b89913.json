William Hill cut Again to 7-1, from 12-1, for the Oaks following her battling neck defeat of Lahaleeb. Imagine completed the Irish Guineas-Oaks double in 2001, but the gap between the two races had narrowed in recent years and the Curragh Classic went off the radar for Oaks runners. Now there is once again 12 days between the contests and Wachman will certainly consider Epsom. \"It is up to her owners where she goes and it will depend how she is,\" said the trainer. \"But a mile and a half should not prove a problem to her and she will come on for this run. It turned into a slog today but she stayed on well.\" Wachman, son-in-law of the Coolmore supremo John Magnier, was winning his first Classic with Again, who runs in the colours of Michael Tabor. In a driving finish she ran on strongly to notch a Guineas double for her jockey Johnny Murtagh, who won the Irish 2,000 on Saturday aboard Mastercraftsman. \"She's always been a nice horse and I'm very lucky to have her,\" added Wachman. \"My biggest worry was that she hadn't had a run whereas most of the others had, and with those conditions the race would turn into a real test. I thought the lack of a run showed in the last 100 yards, but Johnny always thought she was going to win.\" Mick Channon, denied a first British or Irish Classic victory with Lahaleeb, nominated the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot as the filly's next race. \"The ground was too quick for her in the Newmarket Guineas but she has proved she is high-class and, when we get the ground, we will go again,\" he said. Cuis Ghaire and Super Sleuth, second and third at Newmarket, were both well beaten yesterday. Super Sleuth was completing a disappointing weekend for trainer Brian Meehan, whose Delegator flopped in Saturday's Irish 2,000 Guineas. Meehan is considering a drop in distance for Delegator, who is entered in the six-furlong July Cup. \"I think he will stick to a mile, but he is in the July Cup and that is a possibility,\" said Meehan yesterday. \"He is fine after the race but Jamie [Spencer] said after three furlongs that he wasn't comfortable on the ground.\" Murtagh followed up his victory on Again with two more narrow wins, on Sesenta and Grand Ducal, but got no response from Thewayyouare in the Tattersalls Gold Cup and trailed in last behind Casual Conquest who led home Famous Name to complete a 1-2 for trainer Dermot Weld. \"Casual Conquest will have the summer off, and we will train him for the Arc,\" said Weld. \"The Irish Champion would be an obvious race for him and I look forward to the second part of the year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
