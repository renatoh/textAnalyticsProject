After four years of testing, Health Canada and the Canadian food inspection agency said on Thursday they had found the salmon developed by Massachusetts-based AquaBounty Technologies to be as safe and nutritious as conventional salmon. The GM fish contains a growth hormone gene from a Chinook salmon and a promoter sequence from an antifreeze protein gene of the eel-like ocean pout, allowing it to grow twice as fast as conventionally farmed Atlantic salmon. It is often ready for market in 16 to 18 months rather than the up to three years needed for conventional salmon. Canadian officials said the GM salmon would not require any special labelling, as no health and safety concerns were identified during testing. \u201cGM foods are becoming more common every day and are part of the regular diets of Canadians,\u201d Health Canada said in a statement. \u201cGM foods that have been approved by Health Canada have been consumed in Canada for many years and are safe and nutritious.\u201d The approval process in Canada has been dogged by concerns raised by environmentalists and consumer groups over the safety of the fish, dubbed \u201cFrankenfish\u201d by its critics, and questions over the risks it could pose to wild salmon populations. The company has said its fish are sterile and currently only raised in landlocked tanks in Canada and Panama. The company has also argued that its GM salmon, originally developed by a group of Canadian scientists at Newfoundland\u2019s Memorial University more than 25 years ago, could help curtail the overfishing of Atlantic salmon and lessen the pressure on stocks of wild salmon. In November, AquaBounty\u2019s salmon was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Just two months later, however, the FDA issued a ban on the import and sale of GM fish until clear labelling guidelines are established. The FDA ban will probably be in effect until at least September 2016. Some speculate it could take years to resolve, meaning Canada could become the first country in the world to have genetically modified salmon on its grocery shelves. The company said on Thursday that they currently do not have any market-size fish for sale. \u201cIt will be a year or more before we do and in limited quantity,\u201d Dave Conley of AquaBounty Technologies told the Guardian. He also noted that the FDA ban could be lifted before the salmon come to market. Health Canada\u2019s approval was met with concern by a broad coalition of environmental groups in Canada, who pointed to the lack of public consultation and dispute the waived labelling requirement. \u201cCanadians could now be faced with the world\u2019s first GM food animal, approved with no public consultation and no labelling,\u201d said Lucy Sharratt of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network.
