A chap calling himself Ed turned up for the day in Lowestoft, from Oxford University, even though they hadn\u2019t advertised at Oxford. Not much else about Ed added up \u2013 he didn\u2019t know the other activists from his area, and he asked leading questions as if \u201ctrying to get them to say something embarrassing\u201d. He mentioned \u201ccentral office\u201d and \u201cpolitical A-listers\u201d, Tory terms that aren\u2019t used by the Labour party. But only after his attempt at doorknocking did the MPs have to stifle giggles. \u201cThey weren\u2019t interested,\u201d Ed told them. \u201cThey said: \u2018We don\u2019t want to give the keys back to the people who crashed the car\u2019.\u201d Ashworth said: \u201cAt that point I almost burst out laughing \u2013 people don\u2019t come out with a perfectly formed political slogan from the opposing party while chatting on a doorstep.\u201d After a bit of Googling, De Piero and Ashworth believe they\u2019ve discovered the real identity of Ed. They believe his real name to be Rupert, but prefer not to embarrass him by revealing his full name. So whoever you are, Rupert, you didn\u2019t quite fool them this time. And if you go undercover again, you might want to have answers to tough questions \u2013 such as what your surname is. \u201cFair play to him for trying,\u201d said Ashworth, \u201cbut he was no James Bond.\u201d \u2022 Speaking of people who are not James Bond, Nigel Farage has had to dip into Ukip\u2019s grovelling fund yet again, with an apology visit to a Thai constituent and her husband. South East MEP Janice Atkinson was recorded calling mobile food seller Fa Munday a \u201cting tong from somewhere\u201d. Farage offered \u201cmega, mega apologies\u201d and pleaded with the couple: \u201cPlease do not think it\u2019s representative of our people. It jolly well isn\u2019t.\u201d Grouping millions together with infantile sound effects such as \u201cting tong\u201d or \u201cbongo bongo\u201d? Completely uncharacteristic of Ukip. Mrs Munday\u2019s husband, Vincent, forgivingly says that they remain dedicated Ukip members and are not thinking of leaving. But they\u2019re still no fans of Atkinson: \u201cWhen she spoke to me on the phone she wasn\u2019t apologetic at all; she was quite belligerent [and] forthright in pointing out what a lovely lady she is.\u201d \u2022 Dominique Strauss-Kahn must be feeling humiliated in being the inspiration for the \u201chuffing, puffing and bottom-slapping\u201d sexual predator in the film Welcome to New York, portrayed in plain grotesqueness by G\u00e9rard Depardieu. But if you feel a twinge of pity for old DSK, glance over the figures released by his consulting company, Parnasse: last year the company made a profit of nearly \u20ac766,000, of which he has taken \u20ac700,000 as a \u201cdividend\u201d. Marianne magazine in Paris says that a mere half-hour consultancy with DSK costs \u20ac50,000. Heftier than a post-pudding Depardieu. \u2022 After 15 years online, the news-aggregating website Fark has announced guidelines to ban misogyny from its comments section. Founder Drew Curtis announced on the site: \u201cIf the internet was a dude, we\u2019d all agree that dude has a serious problem with women.\u201d The site will no longer admit \u201crape jokes\u201d, terminology such as \u201c\u2018whores\u201d or \u201csluts\u201d, or \u201csuggesting that a woman who suffered a crime was somehow asking for it\u201d. Slate.com flagged up how commenters are trying to slither around the rules: \u201cWe need to stay under the radar: minx, coquette, hussy, etc.\u201d It\u2019s a brave move from Curtis on a site with an 88% male readership \u2013 but in the same spirit he might want to consider changing his own bio: \u201cDrew runs Fark. Drew likes boobies and beer. That\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d At least the picture only contains him and a beer. \u2022 A 15-year-old\u2019s tweet gained a lot of attention early this morning after being retweeted by Richard Dawkins. She asked the atheist writer: \u201cDo you think it\u2019s right that at my New Zealand high school, we get detentions for not bowing our heads during the prayer?\u201d Dawkins didn\u2019t give his take on it, but plenty of others have, including @AtheistStoned, who quipped: \u201cHow do they know?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
