Tabouleh is a refreshing Lebanese salad with bulgar wheat, spring onions, tomatoes and parsley. According to Abbas, Lebanese food is the best in the Middle East \u2013 he insists he is not biased. I laugh, already sold by his energetic descriptions of parcels of fried cheese and spinach, fresh fish and good coffee. Abbas arrived in the UK from a small village in Lebanon just over eight months ago. Though he has not fully talked about the circumstances of his leaving, I know his life was under threat and I know he desperately misses home and his family. At the start of our first two meetings Abbas cheerfully waves a piece of paper at me with a heartfelt mixture of relief, sadness and joy in his eyes. It is an official document granting him the right to remain in the UK for five years. I've spent several hours chatting with Abbas since I was first introduced to him a month ago through the Time Bank refugee mentoring scheme. It has taken me a huge chunk of that time to work out how I can help him. At first, I lunged on each opportunity to \"meddle\" in Abbas's life as he tried to make the most of his time in Britain. Abbas wants to improve his English. \"Great - I'll help you find a course,\" I say. But, I learn, he is already enrolled at a college in Chelsea. On our second meeting at a coffee shop, Abbas tells me he has been waiting weeks for his National Insurance card. With gusto I tell him of the bureaucratic call centre network that props up the British government. \"But don't worry, I can call them for you,\" I say reassuringly. He reassures me: \"No, no. My solicitor is helping me.\" Once I finally relaxed, it became clear that Abbas hugely appreciated just talking. It was a chance for him to practice his English \u2013 something he doesn't get to do in the house he shares with other refugees \u2013 and pick up on the nuances of British life. Unfortunately, unlike my parents, Abbas cannot call me to task every time I replace commas and full stops with \"like.\" Or place invisible question marks after non-questions and raise my voice. Not wanting to pass on bad habits, I find myself speaking like a trained BBC presenter, sentences rammed with information. Poor Abbas. Watching his furrowed brow as I sat opposite him in the Canary Wharf Ideas Store library, with my BBC hat on explaining why a free course on higher education opportunities might interest him, he looked tired. I was tired too. Abandoning the session we go for coffee and things perk up as Abbas starts to talk about his family and Lebanon. I enjoy listening to Abbas talk about his country and his recently widowed mother. It is the only time he becomes animated. His face lights up, the tense shoulders disappear and his guard is dropped. We spend bank holiday at the Tate Britain. I rush over to Abbas who is standing outside one of the entrances to Pimlico tube station in the rain. As I struggle to get my umbrella perform its magic Abbas smiles mischievously and says, \"I called my mother this morning. She tells me it's beautiful and sunny and everyone is out swimming.\" I give up on the umbrella. \"It always rains on bank holidays in England. You should be worried if it doesn't.\" Abbas nods, understanding in his eyes, I feel good; I've taught Abbas something truly important about British culture. \u00b7 TimeBank tackles social issues by finding ways for people to give their time that inspire them and match their lives, including the charity's refugee mentoring project, Time Together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
