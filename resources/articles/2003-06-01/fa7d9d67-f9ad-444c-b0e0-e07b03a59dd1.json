The question exercising the game now, and provoking a widespread mood of anger and resentment, is why only five of the six offenders have been named. The champions St Helens, ambitious Hull FC and poor old Halifax (who must have some sympathy with Britain's Eurovision flops Jemini, as their two-point salary-cap penalty leaves them with precisely nil) have all signalled their intention to appeal. In contrast Halifax and London Broncos have accepted the drugs bans imposed on their players - a month for Fax's veteran Kiwi Martin Moana for his naivety in taking too many slimming supplements, and a year for London's big wing Dominic Peters, who tested positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol and has had his contract terminated. However, one Super League player was cleared to play this weekend despite testing positive for an unnamed illegal substance, admittedly \u00a32,500 poorer and with a six-month suspended sentence hanging over him. The only explanation for this anomaly from the Rugby Football League in an official statement was unspecified 'mitigating factors'. The name of Diane Modahl is never far from their thoughts when it comes to drug cases, after the runner sued the British Athletic Federation a few years ago, bringing the governing body to its knees. The problem with not naming the offender is that it leaves a cloud over the League's innocent players. The size of the fine leaves little doubt that it is a leading player, which makes the players at the leading clubs especially angry, and to make matters worse most people close to the game have a fair idea who has been let off the hook. The RFL were less reticent when it came to naming the salary-cap offenders, which has infuriated Hull's chief executive David Plummer, who believes the guilty clubs should have had the chance to appeal before their punishments were made public. The table certainly has a strange look this morning, with St Helens level on points with Warrington despite having won a game more, and Halifax pointless at the bottom despite their opening win in London. There will also be an element of uncertainty for the next month or so, until the appeals are heard, especially as the RFL's recent record in enforcing punishments is not great. Wakefield, the only club who have previously been found guilty of a salary-cap breach, had their punishment halved to two points on appeal in 2001, which saved them from relegation, while last year the League were forced to back down when St Helens contested a fine for fielding a below-strength team. However, in this case the League should be commended, as it was the Super League clubs who wanted a salary cap introduced, and they are merely policing it effectively. As Sean McGuire, Saints' chief executive, admitted in confirming his club's appeal: 'We are firm supporters of the cap and we realise that for it to work, it can't be seen as toothless.' The cap remains the clubs' most effective tool in persuading their players and supporters that the game cannot sustain the current level of contract payments, and in the past couple of years there have been signs that the flat \u00a31.8million cap is helping to promote greater depth in the competition. In the past week, for example, Saints have made four players available, while on Friday Gary Connolly scored the try that took Leeds back to the top of the table against a Wigan club forced to release him during the winter by salary-cap pressures. It also provides a fascinating extra dimension to today's derby at Wilderspool, where Warrington could now displace Saints from the top six play-off positions. London face the daunting task of stopping Bradford at their Odsal fortress in the only other Sunday game, with the former Bull Paul Sykes taking over from Peters on the wing. Meanwhile, the Broncos continue to consider a loan move for Liam Botham, possibly in time for next Sunday's game against Widnes in Aberavon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
