There are, nevertheless, questions to be asked about the RTS awards. Television companies nominate entries. Television companies prepare the entries themselves (often at some expense). Only the entries can be considered - no other broadcast material is taken into account. And the judging panels are largely composed of television company executives. Hardly a recipe for transparency. Contrast this with the Medical Journalists Association awards. Any member can nominate anybody. Nominations are listed on the MJA's website and members vote for the winners, without the benefit of judging panels. Isn't that rather more open - and fairer? Lawrence McGinty, health and science editor, ITV News, London Mail's e-paper is a gimmick I read with interest and mild amusement the piece about the Mail launching an e-paper (Are you ready for the Daily Download?, February 19). The question posed by the writer, Bobbie Johnson, seemed to hit the nail on the head. Is a partnership with Microsoft and the launch of a digitally advanced Mail e-reader innovation for innovation's sake? Unquestionably, yes. The idea that this extension of service will not cannibalise its current market seems a little optimistic. I am doubtful that it will reach additional people to those already reading the Mail through traditional means. In fact it serves as no more than a marketing gimmick. If the Daily Mail really wants to target new audiences it needs to follow the Newspaper Society and localise its content. We do not all live in London and there are some interesting things that go on in the regions; why not start talking to us relevantly with local content? Clients have budgets to spend on local digital advertising, but on most newspaper websites - even where there is a local section - there doesn't seem to be a local sales force to speak to. ITV Local is rolling out its broadband local programming offer, and if newspapers really want to set a precedent they should stop focusing on new technology for new technology's sake and start tailoring relevant audience-focused content by region. This will attract new audiences by appealing to people who otherwise would have stuck to reading their local rag. Broadcast is already doing it, maybe it's time newspapers caught up.

Sadly we didn't make The Queen although people often assume we did and I get congratulatory notes about it because it feels like a BBC film! However it has been a very rich year for BBC Films. Here are just a few examples of why: Two number one UK box-office hits this year for Miss Potter and Notes on a Scandal. Four Oscar nominations for Notes on a Scandal and great critical acclaim. The Cannes Jury prize for Red Road and the Bafta new director's award for Red Road. The History Boys is also a notable critical and commercial success. Christine joining us is a great asset to the team and hopefully we will go from strength to strength!
