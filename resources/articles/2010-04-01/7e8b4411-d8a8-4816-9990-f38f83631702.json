All of a sudden, the tight black buds of the ash broke open and out came the flower tufts like strange polyps opening from a reef \u2013 an appropriate form given that the ash grew directly on limestone formed by a coral reef 425m years ago. The slightest touch of branches releases little clouds of gold-grey pollen. I rattled some ash stems and the pollen wafted along the wood's edge, suddenly alive with white violets, peacock butterflies and willow warbler song. From great isolated boundary markers in hedges to tall woodland trees to young sapling scrub, the ash is the most characteristic tree on Wenlock Edge, and this is one of its great collective moments of the year. There must have been a million trees sending out pollen into the bright April air, such a cloud of life. One of the great things about the Icelandic ash cloud is that it reminds us how dynamic and globally present geological activity is. Looking out across the rolling, burgeoning, bird-singing green of the Shropshire countryside, recent earthquake disasters seemed remote, but the ash from Iceland brings the fiery workings of the demons of plate tectonics brilliantly into the colours of sunset. The ash pollen also has an atmospheric presence, and together with all the other plants' pollen, an eruption of male DNA, it will feel like pollution to those suffering from hay fever. But we could also think of it as a kind of presence in the air, like birdsong but undetectable unless it makes us sneeze. Like the bird's chorus, the pollen cloud is a great affirmation of life, an explosive eruption of potential into the future, however troubled and uncertain that may be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
