But as the government changed its help for unemployed people into its new flagship Work Programme, many thousands of specialist advisers \u2013 the very people who could provide the expertise to do this \u2013 were also made redundant. There is a palpable fear of a lack of long-term stability in the welfare-to-work sector and a structure that is dependent on whichever political administration is in power. Unsurprisingly, many people have been put off working in the sector again. They are bemused that after years of helping others to find jobs, they now have to register at the job centre themselves. While the Work Programme does have potential to make a difference to people's lives and to benefit the flailing economy, as with all reforms the system is facing teething problems, one of which is around the availability of skilled advisers. Unless contractors think carefully about their staff retention and talent management, through peer-to-peer training and structured development programmes for example, it's evident that the programme could undergo shortages of the right qualified personnel. Staff must be supported to progress and given clear guidance on what is expected at each level. It would also be useful to mirror the in-work support that they will be providing to those they place in work. The Work Programme consolidates and replaces previous schemes run under Labour . A new focus on payments by results to private and not-for-profit providers is a radical departure. It is now a numbers game \u2013 with payment awarded for people placed regardless of how long they have been unemployed. The danger is that the focus will become on the \"low-hanging fruit\" \u2013 people who are easy to place \u2013 rather than on those who require more time and help. This will not be an easy shift in practice for those who have previously worked in this area and built up years of experience. The new delivery model will need personnel to be more results-driven, commercial and focused on retention. However, with many advisers joining the sector to make a genuine difference to peoples' lives (80% of those who attended our workshops), there is a fear that this new-look programme, with all the focus on results, will not allow advisers the time and resources needed to help vulnerable groups. Although investing in staff development may seem financially risky for providers, this short-term pain is necessary in the longer term. This is because it is important to bridge the gap between the old and new mindsets and help those advisers still in the sector get to grips with their new organisations, workloads, ways of working and new targets. The new system exacerbates an already low staff retention rate in the welfare-to-work sector and this will need to be dealt with through training and development plans for career progression. It's only with this kind of foresight and planning that organisations specialising in helping the unemployed back to work will retain talented staff.
