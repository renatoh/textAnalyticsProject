A sour end to the day with news that Rostropovich has sustained a potentially serious injury. It\u2019s to be hoped everything is done to save the galloper. On the track, Vow And Declare struck back for Australia with a popular victory in the Melbourne Cup, handing trainer Danny O\u2019Brien and jockey Craig Williams their first win in the big race. Off the track animal rights protesters made their points, illustrating that while many celebrate this day, many don\u2019t. The Melbourne Cup is still an Australian institution, but it\u2019s a long way from everyone\u2019s idea of a party. Thanks for your company. More fallout from the Melbourne Cup with jockey Michael Walker banned for excessive whip use on eventual runner-up, Prince Of Arran. Walker pleaded guilty to using the whip 12 times prior to the 100m mark, receiving a seven-meeting suspension and a $10,000 fine. Reports that all horses emerged from the Melbourne Cup uninjured are not accurate. Rostropovich, who ran last, was found to be lame by stewards and taken to Werribee Equine Clinic with a suspected broken pelvis. Royal Symphony runs flat on resumption and the race goes to Tactical Advantage, who is given a cute ride by Damien Oliver, produced late off the heels of the leaders to take over in the final 100m. Holbien runs well for second at huge odds with Milwaukee and Parsifal next in line. The winner was sent off around 7-1, leaving the the Fictional Fiver with a skinny profit of +$7 and just one race to be run on Melbourne Cup day. The penultimate race on Melbourne Cup day, the MSS Security Sprint over the straight six furlongs, sees the return of Royal Symphony, 738 days after his fourth placing behind Winx in the 2017 Cox Plate. The five-year-old entire has a new trainer and is being backed, so that speaks well of his wellbeing, but the Fictional Fiver is on favourite Parsifal. Plenty of talk doing the rounds, and I\u2019m not kidding, about whether men should or should not wear socks to the Melbourne Cup. Apparently it\u2019s provoking quite the debate. First world problems, eh? For the first time, male entrants in fashions on the field are this year permitted to not wear socks. I have one rule when it comes to socks: I don\u2019t wear them with thongs. And I\u2019m glad to see Usain Bolt has something on between his feet and his size-15s. Fifteenth time lucky for Craig Williams... For those who don\u2019t yet know, and are interested, Rostropovich ran last in the Melbourne Cup. So if you drew this horse in your office sweep, get in the queue to get your money back! Runaway takes up his customary front-running role but is gone at the 300m. Looks Like Elvis looks like winning but is nabbed on the line by Yulong Prince, who at around $10 does what So You Win couldn\u2019t do - give Chris Waller his third win on Melbourne Cup day. That\u2019s also three winners today for jockey Nash Rawiller. The horses near the fence have it again and Plein Ciel, who is forced to go around the field from near last, runs on but might as well be pushing a marble up hill with his tail. That winner in race one seems an eternity away, and the Fictional Fiver is now showing a profit of just +$12. The racing rolls on, and the race after the Melbourne Cup always seems to surface barely seconds after the big race. The Furphy Plate is a minute away and So You Win is tipped to provide Chris Waller with his third winner of the day, but the Fictional Fiver, now down to a profit of +$17, is going for an each-way play on Plein Ciel. Race favourite Junipal is being backed out of the stalls but has been passed fit to run. I stood on the lawn for race 7: the one that \u201cstops the nation\u201d. But before the horses were out of the gates, a man wandered back under the pavilion, telling his friend: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be out here watching the horses run ... I want to be partying.\u201d For about two minutes, though, most eyes were transfixed on the track. There were two sets of cheers; one when Vow And Declare appeared to past the post first; and another when that was officially announced over the PA. Shortly after, many punters turned on their heels and waded into the increasingly bulging crowds under the grandstand. To the bar. And another race begins. The protest of 4th v 2nd has been upheld by stewards, who called the protest in the first place. Word is trainers Joseph O\u2019Brien (Master Of Design) and his dad Aidan (Il Paradiso) declined to offer anything meaningful at the protest hearing. So Prince Of Arran is promoted to second, Il Paradiso to second and Master Of Reality demoted to fourth. Prize money for second, $1.1m, is more than the purse for third and fourth combined. New placings: 23. Vow And Declare 12. Prince Of Arran 20. Il Paradiso 3. Master Of Reality The stewards\u2019 protest is ongoing so we are yet to get correct weight on the Melbourne Cup. The longer this goes on, the more chance Master Of Reality has of being demoted out of the placings. The horse really did shift in under pressure. Things are a bit looser now. In the long queue that leads to the lawns, a woman is yelling \u201cGiddy up! Giddy up!\u201d Love is in the Air gets a few people dancing. Nicholas Dodd, of New York, has come to the cup by himself. He\u2019s come to enjoy the atmosphere and tradition, and so far he\u2019s loving it. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling,\u201d he says. Norma Weekes, 65, has come down from Newcastle with her husband. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done a cruise or anything [special] in our lives, so we thought we\u2019d do the Melbourne Cup cruise.\u201d And here\u2019s the race report for this year\u2019s Melbourne Cup. Excellent news that all 24 runners and riders have emerged from the race in good health. And my did all contestants put in. This was a brutal, stamina-sapping Melbourne Cup and Vow And Declare looked beaten several times down the straight but showed amazing reserves of endurance and determination to come out on top. Stewards\u2019 Protest: no objections were lodged but the stewards are holding an enquiry given the second horse, Master Of Reality, shifted in and inconvenienced the fourth horse, Il Paradiso, close to the line. If upheld, Prince Of Arran will be promoted to second and Il Paradiso to third. A huge run from Surprise Baby to finish hard into fifth, beaten about a length, after circling the entire field from back in the field. On or near the rail was the place to be in this Melbourne Cup. There was plenty of interference at the business end and we may hear more in the stewards\u2019 room, though the winner will be fine. Connections of the horses finishing second to fifth will feel they might have won, and for Frankie Dettori, rider of Master Of Reality, it\u2019s another near miss. Vow And Declare is the first Australian-bred winner of the Melbourne Cup since Shocking in 2009. It\u2019s trainer Danny O\u2019Brien\u2019s first cup win and jockey Craig Williams\u2019 first win in his 15th ride in the race. \u201cTremendous training effort from Danny O\u2019Brien and his team. I feel very privileged. I grew up watching races, dreamt of these occasions like this but I can\u2019t do it without my team around me,\u201d said the winning jockey. \u201cVow And Declare gave me a wonderful ride. I wasn\u2019t given any instructions. I want to savour the moment. Thanks to all the people who turned out today.\u201d The horses were spread across the track but the horses along the inside had it in a punishing push to the line. Master Of Reality looked to have pinched it, and Il Paradiso and Prince Of Arran came with threatening runs, but local galloper Vow And Declare comes out on top in a blanket finish. 2019 Melbourne Cup: 23. Vow And Declare 3. Master Of Reality 12. Prince Of Arran 20. Il Paradiso Horses have left the barriers in the 2019 Melbourne Cup! Finche begins well but it\u2019s a mad rush to the winning post the first time. Vow And Declare takes it up with Twilight Payment and Master Of Reality close behind. Mer De Glace and Constantinople settle in midfield. The pace is muddling. The horses are milling around behind the stalls. The Chosen One is being supported at huge odds - $101 into $34. Mer De Glace enters the stalls in barrier two, Mustajeer follows. Not many sweating up. Just a few out of line now. We\u2019re almost ready. You can\u2019t please everyone, and I\u2019m clearly not doing enough for Melanie Kavai in Port Moresby. Hi Scott, Please advise on the race now and what is the latest news on the race? Waiting your updates. Still, I\u2019ll take that. The only thing worse than people talking about you is people not talking about you. OK, Melanie, this one\u2019s for you: We are 5 minutes out from the race, the track is now a Soft 5, Nash Rawiller has shown that the inside is no bad place to be, if Prince Of Arran wins he\u2019ll be the first horse since Phar Lap to win the Melbourne Cup after running third the previous year, Finche is thus named because his father is Frankel and his mother is Binche, Southern France isn\u2019t actually from southern France, there are eight \u2018O\u2019Brien\u2019 runners in the race - four for Joseph, three for Aidan and one for Danny, I\u2019m still tipping Surprise Baby, and Archer won the first two Melbourne Cups. Right, so Surprise Baby goes on top for me and I\u2019m glad to see some support for the local stayer. But, on very rare occasions, I\u2019ve been known to be wrong. So here are the other horses I can see winning: Southern France, Mustajeer, Prince Of Arran, Downdraft, Constantinople, Il Paradiso and Vow And Declare. On the grounds of value and stamina concerns, I\u2018m happy to leave favoured runners Mer De Glace and Finche out of calculations. After all, unless you\u2019re going to box up 24 horses in a 1% flexi trifecta, you can\u2019t tip them all. Some market moves just over 20 minutes away from the 159th edition of the Melbourne Cup. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the Melbourne Cup is a day of celebration for some and a day of mourning for others. Cupdate: Finche retains his grip on favouritism for the Melbourne Cup at around $8. Constantinople and Mer De Glace are on the next line of betting with local hopes Vow And Declare and Surprise Baby not far behind. At a longer price, Raymond Tusk and The Chosen One are attracting support. Out in the parade ring, John Paul Young is pounding out a stirring rendition of his 1970s classic Love Is In The Air. What, couldn\u2019t Taylor Swift make it or something? And the winner is ... Mer De Glace is on the drift for the Melbourne Cup and is now out to around $10 in latest markets. The stayer is looking to become the second Japanese-trained galloper to win the cup and the first since Delta Blues in 2006. La Tigeresa looms down the outside after settling near last but is swamped by Teleplay hard on the rails. Nash Rawiller wins another race coursing the shortest way home and Teleplay wins another race on Melbourne Cup day, this time paying around $13. Sweet Scandal finishes third. La Tigeresa does everything but win but that\u2019s of no use to the Fictional Fiver, which is now down to a profit of +$22. Onto the cup now. The sixth race on the card, the Jim Beam Stakes, is 10 or so minutes away and I won\u2019t lie, a winner would be nice. Sweet Scandal and La Tigeresa are vying for favouritism at odds of 3-1 or just longer and I\u2019m with the latter. The Fictional Fiver is going straight out on La Tigeresa. Gulp. This one\u2019s the curtain raiser. One race to go until the Melbourne Cup. I wandered over to the Birdcage. If you don\u2019t believe me, here is the evidence. Lots of pastel coloured marquees, lots of white teeth. There is a Bumble (yes, the dating app) marquee, another one appears to be forest themed. Towards the back, a man in a multi-coloured suit is playing a piano lounge cover of Dancing Queen. After some friendly (but inaudible, to me) feedback from the small crowd who are taking in the music, he says: \u201cI was married for 14 years. I know women are always right.\u201d I spot the deputy PM Michael McCormack briskly walking through. Back on the lawns, the crowd is becoming a bit more lively. The sunshine looks glorious. These signs are situated through the public area. Danny Drago has emailed in asking for winners. I\u2019m betting for Melbourne cup please can you tip a good horse for me. Yes, I\u2019ve tipped a few losers in a row, Danny. But we\u2019re still in profit for the time being. And I\u2019m hoping Surprise Baby does the right thing in the Melbourne Cup. For what it\u2019s worth, Lindsay Lohan is on the TV right now and she\u2019s tipping Finche in the big one. Why shouldn\u2019t we follow Li-Lo\u2019s advice on a horse race? I\u2019m sure she can spot the speed of a steed as well as the rest of us. Speaking of speed, if you\u2019ve ever wondered how fast a horse runs in comparison to a Formula One car, a T-Rex, Usain Bolt and a tortoise, wonder no more. The money is spot on as South Australian three-year-old Garner weaves through traffic down the centre of the course and wins with his ears pricked. Nice ride by Dwayne Dunn. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice horse. He just keeps stepping up,\u201d trainer Gordon Richards said of the son of Barbados, who has now won half of his six starts. Can\u2019t Be Done grabs the silver medal, with Hawker Hurricane running third at long odds. Despite drawing favourably in the middle of the track, Craig Williams somehow allows Santorini Summer to drift over to the stands side and is never competitive. After a good start to the day, the Fictional Fiver is now down to a profit of +$27. The fifth race is approaching fast and we have another very well-backed runner, the Gordon Richards-trained Garner who has been smashed into around 3-1. The gelding has an undeniable chance but the Fictional Fiver is going each-way on Santorini Summer. Interesting post here from ausrover. Predictably, it\u2019s provoked quite the response from others following this blog. Scroll down to the comments section for a read ... and have your own say. Fascinating. The sun is beaming down onto the crowds on the lawns in front of the home straight. The grass is damp, but it hasn\u2019t stopped people laying picnic blankets down to enjoy a glass of bubbly or beer. Lots of people are taking the chance to get their social media snaps in, presumably while things are still classy. But it still feels very early here. There is a quiet hum, which gently rises as the first few races are run and won. Some are already getting into the swing of things, though. Etah James sets a solid pace with Sin To Win crossing over from his wide draw, and for a moment the hot favourite Shared Ambition looks to be in a spot of bother on the fence back in the field. But as horses roll off the paint, Nash Rawiller blows the whistle and sends Shared Ambition to the lead near the clocktower. Creedence runs on well from the rear to grab second with topweight Big Blue battling into third. But all honours are with the winner, who returns $1.40 for the win and is likely to be set for the 2020 Melbourne Cup. Sin To Win plugs away down the straight but finishes midfield, meaning the Fictional Fiver is down to a profit of +$32. The fourth race, curiously titled The Macca\u2019s Run, is upon us. And we have an extremely short-priced favourite, the Chris Waller-trained Shared Ambition at around $1.50. The working man that I am, I can\u2019t step into any figures of the colour red. So the Fictional Fiver will be having an each-way flutter on Sin To Win at around $18. The TAB is reporting a $40,000 bet on Shared Ambition. Easy money, right?! The Melbourne Cup really is providing a platform for people who love horse racing, and those who don\u2019t, to express their views. And in a democratic society, both views should be welcomed. Outside Flemington racecourse, punters were greeted by a group of about 30 animal rights protesters holding placards and wearing sandwich boards. Their signs carried messages such as \u201cAnother Race, Another Victim\u201d while music blared with an ominous voice over. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel, barbaric and outdated.\u201d And \u201cThe Sport of Kings can\u2019t afford a retirement plan\u201d. \u201cWe think there\u2019s been a huge shift,\u201d Elio Celotto, of the coalition for the protection of racehorses, told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see people are taking affirmative action and choosing not to support the Melbourne Cup.\u201d But despite the protesters\u2019 best efforts, there was a steady flow of patrons heading into the racecourse in what is expected to be one of the most weather-blessed cup days in recent years. \u201cHave a good day today. Hope a horse isn\u2019t put down,\u201d one protester told a group of men in loud suits. Sure Knee is given a peach of a ride by Kerrin McEvoy, presented down the middle of the track off her wide draw to cruise away from her rivals at odds of $5. Aliferous does the best of the beaten brigade, with Extreme Pride running third. But both were well beaten \u201cShe has a great record here and put them away at the furlong,\u201d McEvoy said of the winner. The Fictional Fiver had the right trainer but wrong horse, with Romani Girl finishing nearer last than first. But we\u2019re still showing a profit of +$37. Just minutes away from the third race and one here has been backed off the map. One More Try, with Damien Oliver in the pigskin, is as short as $4 having been available at double-figure odds this morning. But I\u2019m not one to follow the money, so the Fictional Fiver is going on Romani Girl for Chris Waller and Tommy Berry. Each-way odds of around 7-1 will do nicely. Of the 24 steeds to line up in today\u2019s cup, half are trained overseas. Of the rest, a further nine started their racing careers overseas. Which leaves us with three dinky-di locals - Surprise Baby, Vow And Declare and Youngstar - to fly the flag for the home defence. It\u2019s enough to make Bart Cummings turn in his grave. But while the odds are stacked against this triumvirate, I rate two of them as genuine winning chances. Vow And Declare has had a beautiful preparation and is feared, but Surprise Baby goes on top for me. We don\u2019t yet know how good this lightly raced stayer is but what we do know is that two miles is his trip. His Adelaide Cup win at start No.6, jumping from 2000m at his previous start, was the performance of a high-quality stayer. Fast forward to the gelding\u2019s most recent start, his victory in the G3 The Bart Cummings, and the impression remains that Surprise Baby was born for the Flemington 3200m (his dad Shocking, after all, won the Melbourne Cup a decade ago). The soft track won\u2019t be a worry and neither will the wide draw; if anything both factors might be in his favour. The Guardian says: Surprise Baby Il Paradiso Vow And Declare Constantinople Best roughie: Southern France One coin. Two sides. Channel 10\u2019s coverage of cup day looks to be going along more or less without a hitch. But it just isn\u2019t the same without Bruce McAvaney. Bruce\u2019s tones and insight are most certainly missed. I\u2019m hoping one year Alan Gordon Partridge gets a shot at anchoring Melbourne Cup day. As you can see below (and apologies to those who have seen this before and/or had it rammed down your throat over the years by yours truly), he is most qualified. A real slog over the last 200m with any number of horses looking likely, but Bravo Tango puts his neck out at the right time to deny East Indiaman by about a head with William Thomas back in third. The hot favourite, Phaistos, fills fourth place, meaning the cash stays in the bookies\u2019 bag. Oh so close, but oh so far, for the Fictional Fiver. The balance now stands at +$42. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s more worrying - that these grown men looked in the mirror this morning and gave themselves the thumbs-up, or that at Flemington today their appearance is entirely acceptable. Cupdate: Eight minutes out from the second race on the card, the track remains a Soft 6. Plenty of rain in Melbourne yesterday but today is clear, dry and still. Don\u2019t be surprised if the track is upgraded to a Soft 5 in the coming races. While we\u2019re on the upcoming race, the Grinders Coffee Roasters Trophy, I\u2019m keen on East Indiaman so let\u2019s put the Fictional Fiver on this talented son of Hinchinbrook. More here from Luke Henriques-Gomes ... and a vivid illustration of how the Melbourne Cup brings all walks of life together. Australians love a bet. We are top of the pops when it comes to money gambled per capita, well clear of the likes of Singapore, Ireland and the United States. This year, Tabcorp predicts $1bn will be turned over over the eight key days of the spring carnival (four of which take place at Flemington this week). And don\u2019t those who stand to benefit just love it. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Henriques-Gomes is at Flemington today and will be keeping us up to date with news, tidbits and goings-on at the track. Animal rights protesters are making their views known as racegoers head to the track. Aryaaf jumps smartly from her outside draw and races like a drunken sailor over the final furlong, but is driven out by Luke Nolen to overhaul Muntaseera and win running away. Marchena takes the bronze medal. The winner pays $9.40 on S-Tab, meaning the Fictional Fiver is up and away and showing a balance of +$47. Race one is barely eight minutes away, the Darley Ottowa Stakes for two-year-old fillies. Time was when the day\u2019s proceedings were kicked off by the Cup Day Hurdle. The times, they are most certainly changing. Of the 15 juveniles to face the starter down the Flemington straight, 13 are unraced. For that reason, I\u2019m going to drop a pin on the form guide and place my Fictional Fiver on Aryaaf, No.2 on the card representing the Lindsay Park team. The times, they are a changing. Horse racing wants as many eyeballs as possible on the Melbourne Cup, but scrutiny on this year\u2019s race is at unprecedented levels. And not for reasons racing administrators were wanting. Have a read of this yarn, written by a gent whose character I\u2019m in no position to praise. Good morning, sports fans. Melbourne Cup day, I presume. The race that stops, and divides, a nation. It means many different things to many different folk. To some (Victorians), it\u2019s an excuse to indulge in a long dinner the night before, disable the alarm clock and spend the morning over a coffee rifling through the form guide (or, if the nags isn\u2019t your thing, gleefully spending the day off work for reasons you don\u2019t quite understand). For others, it\u2019s reason enough to dust off the glad rags and get your backside trackside. For many, it\u2019s the one day a year you\u2019ll have a bet. And regardless of your view on the Melbourne Cup, as a nation we go a bit crazy on it - last year $115 million was wagered on the cup with Tabcorp alone, and the wagering company estimates three million Australians will bet with them today. Astounding. For an increasing number, however, this is a day of sadness and regret. To many horse racing is cruel enough. But the recent revelations of cruelty and mass slaughter at Australian knackeries is another level, and the public response entirely justified. It\u2019s incumbent on horse racing to safeguard the welfare of its equine participants and my two cents, straight on the nose, is this provides administrators with a golden opportunity to get its house in order so these atrocities can\u2019t, and won\u2019t, happen again. What\u2019s unarguable, however, is the Melbourne Cup is an Australian institution. And it\u2019s my pleasure to bring you updates, news, views, tips (best ignored), protests, colour, fashion (not mine) and even a word or two from the horses\u2019 mouth. But it won\u2019t be same without your involvement.
