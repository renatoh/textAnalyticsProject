And \u2013 fair warning \u2013 it tackles them with a thunderous lack of sensitivity, particularly given that the film is loosely based on a real-life gang rape and murder case. That said, the anger that propels the picture towards violence is authentic and the official corruption and collusion depicted are all too real. Director Anubhav Sinha, who also co-wrote, has an eye for the kind of searing image that drives home a point. And Ayushmann Khurrana, playing the good cop who can\u2019t bring himself to look away to preserve \u201csociety\u2019s balance\u201d, combines soulful Bollywood heartthrob charisma with an arrestingly intense performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
