They were called to Islington just before 2.30pm after reports that two boys aged 16 or 17 had been attacked. When emergency crews arrived they found the pair with stab wounds in Upper Street. One of the boys was pronounced dead at the scene as the area was sealed off. The other was taken to a north London hospital with injuries which are not thought to be life threatening. A police spokesman said a male had been arrested near the scene of the attack and was being questioned at a north London police station. The victim, who has not been named, brings the number of teenagers killed in London this year to 26, the Metropolitan police said. This month, David Nowak, 16, was stabbed to death in Stoke Newington. Last month promising footballer Etem Celebi, 17, was shot dead on the Smalley Road Estate, also in Stoke Newington. The death is the latest in a trend of teenage knife and gun crime in the capital which has included 16 fatal stabbings, nine shootings and one where no cause of death was identified."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
