The family of the 31-year-old trainee gas engineer and father of two spent over an hour discussing the case with Scotland\u2019s first minister and the cabinet secretary for justice, Michael Matheson, on Tuesday. The family believe that post-mortem evidence suggests Bayoh died of positional asphyxia after being brought to the ground by four police officers. They asked the Scottish government to consider the possibility of holding a public inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005, for which there is already legal precedent in Scotland. Aamer Anwar, Scotland\u2019s leading civil liberties lawyer, who is acting for the family, has previously described how within seconds of confronting Bayoh on the street at 7.10am on 3 May, officers had sprayed him with CS gas and pepper spray, even though he was unarmed and had not initially resisted arrest \u2013 despite eyewitness reports suggesting he had been wielding a knife. Following Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Anwar said: \u201cIt has been 29 weeks since Sheku Bayoh lost his life in police custody on the streets of Kirkcaldy. Sheku\u2019s three sisters met with the first minister and justice secretary this morning to voice their serious concerns over the wider issue of deaths in custody and the inability of the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) to hold Police Scotland to account.\u201d The Bayoh family has previously met with the PIRC, the Scottish police misconduct watchdog, whom they have criticised because of a 32-day delay before the officers involved were interviewed or forced to hand over their notebooks. Anwar noted that, while a fatal accident inquiry into Bayoh\u2019s death will be mandatory, the family did not believe that such an investigation would have sufficient remit to cover the wider issues of deaths in custody, use of restraint techniques, racism, lack of police accountability and the insufficient powers of PIRC. Nor would its findings be binding on Police Scotland. Anwar added that the family welcomed Sturgeon\u2019s \u201ccompassion and support\u201d and her assurance that the Scottish government \u201cwill not shy away from learning lessons and bring about fundamental change if necessary\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
