If you\u2019re thinking about where you should go to university and what you should study, you\u2019ve come to the right place. This guide is different from the other university guides you may have come across because it is aimed specifically at students who are trying to choose a course. So it ranks universities on all the factors that are most important to young people: how much they will benefit from the teaching, whether current students like the university and the subject, and what their chances are of getting a good job. It does not include research scores, because these are of limited relevance to students. It includes a score for the ratio between staff and students. And last year we introduced a continuation measure \u2013 this tells you what percentage of first-year students go into second year. It is a good indication of how successful the university is in supporting all students, including those who may be struggling. All these measures are combined into a Guardian score out of 100 - and that\u2019s what forms the basis of the ranking. To get started on picking a course, you need to know a bit about the components of this guide. So let\u2019s take a look at what we\u2019ve got here. What\u2019s in the Guide? \u2022 An overall league table of universities in the UK We have ranked universities according to their Guardian score. You can see how they performed for each of the factors we think are important. The higher up the university is in the league table, the harder it will be to get in. So it may be a good idea to discuss your choices with a teacher or careers adviser. Column 9 tells you the typical Ucas score of a person doing the subject you are interested in. Not every university is in the overall table. Some specialist institutions teach very few subjects so we can\u2019t rank them alongside more general universities, but they will still appear in the subject tables. There are a few gaps in the columns, where data is missing. There are various reasons for this: one of them is a partial student boycott of the National Student Survey last year. Where data is missing, the Guardian score has been calculated based on previous performance for that metric, and the remaining measures. To be listed at all, a university cannot be missing more than 40% of its data. If you want to know more about this, have a look at the detailed methodology written by the compiler. \u2022 Rankings for every subject The Guide also has 54 subject tables, so you can see which universities do well at teaching your subject area. There\u2019s a difference between subjects and courses. Within each of the 54 subject areas, there are many different courses. Here\u2019s an example: You may be interested in doing a course in illustration. Illustration falls into the subject area of design and crafts. So you could go to the design and crafts table, look at which universities do well at it, click on the plus sign next to the name of the university and look for the illustration courses. Or you could put \u201cillustration\u201d directly into the course search at the top of the tables and see what comes up. Then you could go to the design and crafts table to see rankings. \u2022 Subject profiles You might need to know a bit more about the subjects universities offer, because there\u2019ll be lots that you didn\u2019t encounter at school. Have a look at the subject profiles, which were all drawn up with the help of the academics who teach them. You\u2019ll see the job prospects for each subject. You\u2019ll find the links to the subject profiles at the top of each subject table. \u2022 University profiles Clicking on the name of a university in the tables will take you to the university\u2019s profile \u2013 you can read about what makes each institution special and get the info you need on fees, accommodation and bursaries. You\u2019ll see how many students are male/female, and where they come from. Key to the table headings 1. Guardian ranking for this year 2. Guardian ranking for last year 3. Name of university 4. The Guardian score, out of 100, is a rating of excellence based on a combination of all the other factors 5. Course satisfaction: the rating for the overall quality of the course, given by final-year students in the latest National Student Survey (NSS) 6. Teaching quality: the rating for the quality of teaching on the course, given by final-year students in the NSS 7. Feedback: the rating for the quality of feedback and assessment, given by final-year students in the NSS 8. Staff-student ratio: the number of students per member of teaching staff 9. Spend per student: money spent on each student, excluding academic staff costs, given as a rating out of 10 10. Average entry tariff: typical Ucas scores of young entrants (under 21) to the department 11. Value-added score: this compares students\u2019 degree results with their entry qualifications, to show how effectively they are taught. It is given as a rating out of 10 12. Career after six months: percentage of graduates who find graduate-level jobs, or are in further study at professional or HE level, within six months of graduation. It reflects how good the university is at employability 13. Continuation rate: the percentage of first-year students continuing to second year A few points about the methodology \u2022 At some universities, there are so few students studying a particular subject that we can\u2019t include them in the statistics. Courses with small numbers of students are listed at the end of each table, but are not given a ranking. That should not be taken as any comment on their quality. \u2022 In compiling our tables, we have been advised by an expert review group of professionals from UK universities. The group meets regularly to monitor changes in subject areas and the way data is collected, and makes sure we produce the best possible guide. \u2022 The tables have been compiled for the Guardian by Intelligent Metrix, an independent consultancy that specialises in measuring performance in higher education. The rankings are based on official data collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) and the NSS. \u2022 If you want to know more about the methodology used to compile the tables, read the full explanation from Intelligent Metrix. \u2022 The tables compiler, Matt Hiely-Raynor of IntelligentMetrix, will be on Twitter at 2pm on 7 June 2019 to answer questions. Join the conversation. \u2022 And if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes raw data to play around with, check out the spreadsheets \u2013 they have all the numbers you might want to crunch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
