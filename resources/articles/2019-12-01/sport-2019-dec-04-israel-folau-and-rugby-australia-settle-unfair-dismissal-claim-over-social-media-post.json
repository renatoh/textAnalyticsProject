RA apologised to Folau in a joint statement issued on Wednesday that draws a line under the bitter affair, although the exact terms of the settlement will remain confidential. The parties have been involved in mediation this week over Folau\u2019s $14m compensation claim after the former rugby league and AFL player claimed his dismissal by RA and Rugby NSW was unfair, following his post on Instagram that hell awaits \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers\u201d and others. A statement from RA, RNSW and Folau said the post reflected Folau\u2019s \u201cgenuinely held religious beliefs\u201d and that he \u201cdid not intend to harm or offend any person when he uploaded the post\u201d. \u201cMr Folau wants all Australians to know that he does not condone discrimination of any kind against any person on the grounds of their sexuality and that he shares Rugby Australia\u2019s commitment to inclusiveness and diversity,\u201d the statement read. RA said it did not agree with the content of Folau\u2019s post, before each party wished the other well for the future. \u201cInclusiveness is one of rugby\u2019s core values and it welcomes all people to the game, including all members of the LGBTI community,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWhile it was not Rugby Australia\u2019s intention, Rugby Australia acknowledges and apologises for any hurt or harm caused to the Folaus. Similarly, Mr Folau did not intend to hurt or harm the game of rugby and acknowledges and apologises for any hurt or harm caused.\u201d Folau\u2019s four-year, $4m contract was ripped up in May, after an independent panel hearing found his social media post to have breached the terms of his employment, effectively ending his rugby union career in Australia. The 30-year-old had argued \u201cno Australian of any faith should be fired for practising religion\u201d and sought \u201csubstantial remedies\u201d from his former employers. His initial claim of $10m was increased to $14m last week. On Monday the chief executive of Rugby Australia, Raelene Castle, claimed Folau had admitted his comments caused harm but would not hold back from posting whatever he liked. Folau has continued to court controversy since his sacking, most recently attracting criticism for comments he made during a church sermon when he implied the devastating bush fires on Australia\u2019s east coast were God\u2019s punishment for legalising same-sex marriage and abortion. News of Wednesday\u2019s settlement was welcomed by Equality Australia, who said it put an end to a \u201cdivisive and hurtful period for LGBTIQ+ people in rugby, in sport and more generally\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
