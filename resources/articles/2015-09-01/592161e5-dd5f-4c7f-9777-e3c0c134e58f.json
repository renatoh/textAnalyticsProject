Potential changes to the law, following a campaign by pigeon fanciers to reduce attacks on their pets by raptors, have met with opposition from the RSPB. The Raptor Alliance, a body representing many of the UK\u2019s 42,000 pigeon owners, is writing to MPs warning that an \u201ciconic traditional British sport\u201d is under threat as a result of an increasing number of attacks on their birds. It has been buoyed by news that the Law Commission is considering changes to the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act that will allow individual pigeon fanciers to make applications so that problem raptors, such as peregrine falcons or sparrowhawks, can be relocated. \u201cPigeon racing will disappear from our country unless something is done to protect our birds,\u201d said Stewart Wardrop, representative of the Raptor Alliance. A million racing pigeons are bred each year in the UK, with a pedigree racing pigeon sometimes worth several thousand pounds. In 2012 a Chinese businessman paid $300,000 (\u00a3197,000) for a Belgian racing pigeon called Bolt. Some studies suggest that around 14% of birds that did not return to their lofts were taken by raptors, but Wardrop said the true figure was much higher, running into the hundreds of thousands. \u201cIn law, there is no protection for racing pigeons,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your loft is being attacked by raptors, apart from using harsh words to shoo them off you can\u2019t really do anything. Because the number of raptors has grown and grown, pigeon lofts are effectively becoming larders. They just know that at seven o\u2019clock every morning the pigeon fancier lets his pigeons out and breakfast is served.\u201d Wardrop stressed that the alliance was not seeking a blanket cull. \u201cThe licence requirements will be exacting. They must be evidence based, prove suffering or loss, and that all necessary diversionary actions have been taken, before an application can be made.\u201d He said the licences would allow pigeon fanciers to target specific areas. \u201cPigeon fanciers accept losses, but the numbers have grown so big. My father has lost three birds this year, but someone 400 yards away from him has lost 30. Raptors are marvellous creatures but there should be space for all of us.\u201d Part of the problem, the alliance suggests, is that raptors are seen as species in decline. Raptor nesting boxes are being put up on churches and other communal buildings. \u201cIf you encourage peregrines to perch on steeples, you will decimate the sport of those 15 pigeon fanciers who live in the village.\u201d The alliance claims that the pigeon racing industry is worth \u00a3125m a year to the British economy. But it has fallen a long way from the heady days of the 1960s and 70s, when famous footballers dabbled in the sport. \u201cSome 100,000 [people] were involved in the 60s,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cNowadays, famous footballers buy racehorses; in the 60s they had racing pigeons.\u201d Grahame Madge, an RSPB spokesman, disputed claims that raptors were increasing in number. \u201cDespite claims to the contrary, the populations of peregrine falcons and sparrowhawks are not increasing. In fact, evidence suggests sparrowhawk numbers have declined over the last 20 years. Birds of prey are wild birds and we see no argument for, or benefit in, artificially managing their populations.\u201d Madge said it was wrong to blame raptors for the deaths of many racing pigeons. \u201cStudies have shown that around six out of every seven racing pigeons failing to return go missing for other reasons, such as becoming disorientated or colliding with obstacles.\u201d And he questioned the feasibility of relocating raptors. \u201cThere is no strong evidence that relocating sparrowhawks would achieve any benefit and, in fact, we remain concerned that this could lead to effects on the population, which is already in decline. Some birds could find their way back to their original territories, or their absence could create a vacant niche encouraging other birds to move in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
