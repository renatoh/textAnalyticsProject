The glee for the home side was enhanced by the fact that a hat-trick for their captain, Steven Gerrard, was completed in stoppage time. There were other causes of concern for Everton on the night, particularly in the shape of the elusive Luis Su\u00e1rez, who set up that concluding goal. The motivation was great for the Uruguayan and everyone else in the lineup as they strove to make amends for recent shortcomings. No Liverpool player had notched a hat-trick in this fixture since Ian Rush claimed four goals at Goodison in 1982. Gerrard will cherish this occasion, but the jubilation may have practical benefits as well. The victors needed 90 minutes of this sort to make their way out of the doldrums. Kenny Dalglish's players will have left the ground feeling more sure of themselves than they have in weeks. By the close, it was impossible to believe that Liverpool had endured three consecutive defeats in the Premier League before this match. By the end they had equalled their highest score of the league campaign. Everton are usually outstanding in battling their limitations, but there was a technique and deadliness to Liverpool that could not be resisted. If the victors have any anxieties at all they will lie in the fear that Su\u00e1rez might prefer to move to another country to earn a living after that eight-game ban for racial abuse of Patrice Evra. On the other hand an evening of this nature could persuade him that there is nowhere better to pursue his career. The effectiveness of Su\u00e1rez ensured that Everton had no prospect of survival. David Moyes, a few hours from the 10th anniversary of his appointment as manager, has still to steer his side to victory on Liverpool's territory. The prospects have not improved for him, either. Su\u00e1rez was releasing Gerrard into the penalty area as early as the seventh minute, with Tim Howard needing to make a good save. In addition to local rivalry, Liverpool were driven on by a desire to reassert themselves, even if the opener was delayed until the 34th minute. Howard blocked a shot by the overlapping Martin Kelly and the right-back's efforts to win back possession saw the ball run to Gerrard, whose composure was as remarkable as his technique. The delicate finish with the left foot was floated high into the net. It was the type of achievement the club have been craving of late. Everton would have sensed even then that a first victory at this ground since September 1999 was beyond them. Liverpool can generally afford firepower, but there has not been much verve in the recent troubling weeks. The visitors took a limited interest in continuity and the six alterations to the lineup saw Nikica Jelavic, the scorer of the only goal against Tottenham Hotspur, on the bench, possibly because Moyes placed a higher priority on Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final with Sunderland. Even so the inclusion of Phil Jagielka and Jack Rodwell for their first starts since January did not necessarily smack of defeatism. Everton are accustomed to putting up sustained resistance, and the pressure did not cause them to become flustered immediately. As the game got closer to the half-hour mark the visitors even had a period of pressure that arose from their commitment to send players forward in numbers. Su\u00e1rez, on the counterattack, was then thwarted both by Tony Hibbert's tackle and an offside decision, but some of the rigour had gone out of Everton. It was not necessarily a coincidence that the visitors should fall behind just when they had begun attacking with gusto. Whatever the limits to their technique, Everton do not suffer from any lack of spirit and the second half began with a period of pressure. Even so Liverpool were not in jeopardy and, indeed, had the poise to strike again as Gerrard notched a second goal, in the 51st minute. Su\u00e1rez eluded Sylvain Distin on the right but before he could let fly Gerrard stepped in to crash home a drive. Anfield bubbled with a delight that owed as much to the general upsurge of form as to the woes being inflicted on Moyes and his men. There was no intent to let the game fall quiet either. Liverpool, after the difficulties encountered in recent weeks, relished the score yet Everton are never deterred and had enough pride to push towards the opposition's penalty area on occasion. All the same, it was Liverpool and their captain who held a monopoly on menace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
