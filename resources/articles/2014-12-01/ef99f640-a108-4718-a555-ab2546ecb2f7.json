The incident occurred after the Bears\u2019 defeat to the Dallas Cowboys at Soldier Field on Thursday night. Police reported that two fans had been attacked after shouting \u201cCowboys suck\u201d at Dallas fans. But one of the victims says he was stabbed for talking up the Packers. \u201cI was saying the Packers are awesome this year, why can\u2019t I be born a Packers fan?\u201d the 21-year-old told the Chicago Tribune. The comments reportedly angered a fellow Bears supporter who confronted the man. \u201cI went to go shake hands but as soon as I did, his buddy came up and threw beer at my head,\u2019\u2019 said the victim. \u201cBeer got in my eyes and blinded me. Then everything went downhill. I was trying to defend myself and run away. I was running away, I remember.\u201d The man and his friend received stab wounds in the ensuing scuffle but were not seriosuly wounded. \u201cWe were texting each other back and forth even at the hospital,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really that bad, I was laughing the whole time I was in the ambulance and in the hospital.\u201d Police said that both parties appeared to be under the influence of alcohol at the time of the attack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
