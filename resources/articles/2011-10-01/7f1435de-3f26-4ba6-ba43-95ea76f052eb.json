I told him his party had a woman problem. Not only were the Tories failing to connect with women across the political spectrum, I said (although there was a brief babymoon when Samantha produced Florence), the coalition was in danger of actively repelling the very women voters who had in previous years been loyal as labradors to the Tory party. For now tails don't wag whenever the prime minister, a charming smoothie in the flesh, tells a woman to \"calm down, dear\", or suchlike. Since I took on a weekly magazine two years ago, and became responsible for trying and failing to double circulation in a recession, I've met an awful lot of middle-aged Tory women \u2013 thousands, probably \u2013 and if I were Dave and Nick I'd be absolutely terrified. For these women think that politicians in power come across as arrogant and overprivileged and out of touch with their concerns, which are the NHS, care for the elderly, education and student fees. They also worry about food price inflation, the cost of childcare, petrol, and how they're going to live on their pensions. Above all, many, many women I've met are in a state of controlled panic (certainly not a \"quiet crisis\") about their families, and in particular its younger members. They wish that the coalition would stop trying to buy oldie votes with free bus passes and fuel allowances and so on (we've had more than our share of lollipops in the boom part of the cycle) and concentrate on the under-30s, whose futures have already been mortgaged and beggared by my generation to pay for the bust. I said some of the above to the wonk, and wasn't surprised that my generous offer to help in his mission to make the coalition \"more relatable\", especially to my sex, was quietly ignored. The volunteer Audrey Pyle, 60, volunteer at Age Concern shop I've voted for the Tories in the past, mainly because I didn't like Labour. In the last election I voted for the Conservatives in my local borough because they were better than Labour in Camden, but I wouldn't vote for them again now, not unless something major happened. I can retire next year, so for me it's important that they sort out pensions. At the moment retiring is a scary thought: I'll have to keep on working \u2013 well, who knows how long? I don't think they look after the older person \u2013 and they'd have to sort out their act on hospitals as well. Obviously I'm worried about hospital care: I have experience of that with my neighbours and it's not good. So they'd have sort out their act on the NHS and pensions to make me vote for them again. The trade unionist Beverley Woodburn, 40s, union organiser I don't support their policies, particularly because of how they affect young people \u2013 and as a black woman, as well. Many people of my colour are in the National Health Service and in public service, and I couldn't support their policies because of the devastating effect they have on the health services and on public services. At the moment, in their white paper, they're putting the whole education system out to tender, basically, to private business \u2013 and private business has got no place in education. We've just seen in the last year or so the student demonstrations regarding the hike in tuition fees and on this one we can't say it's just the Conservative government \u2013 it's being done with support, with the coalition. The full-time mother Elizabeth Prentice, 36, full-time mother I have voted Conservative in the past. This time I did because I thought they needed to sort out the economy, which is a real mess at the moment, and to make some hard decisions. In principle I'm a Conservative anyway, and I support some of their ethical decisions. I can still remember when Labour came into power in the 1990s when I was at university. I was so excited \u2013 they promised so much, but it just seems like they screwed up and I'm not disillusioned with the Conservatives yet. At the moment I would still vote Conservative in the next general election. I'd find it really interesting to see what the Conservatives would do without a coalition government \u2013 with the reins of the Lib Dems taken off. The communicator Adah Parris, 39, runs the School of Communication Arts (www.schoolcommunicationarts.com) Why are there so few female creatives in advertising? They account for a mere 15% of an industry that contributes \u00a37.8bn to the economy. The future of that same economy relies upon people being involved in ideas, innovation, technology and having entrepreneurial acumen, but to immerse yourself in any career takes sacrifice: more so if you're woman, especially if you have a family. Looking at the coalition's initiatives and policies, you'd be forgiven for thinking they are skewed towards men. This year at the school we have 27 students, 13 female and 14 male. The female ratio would have been higher but few mothers \u2013 many of whom have the talent \u2013 can bear the brunt of the financial loss further study involves, especially with the cuts in childcare vouchers. What's the incentive to go back to work or retrain if you are penalised for it? The coalition talks about enabling social mobility and the creation of apprenticeship schemes, but their recent leaked memo about women's \"fear for the next generation\" smells like a massive \"oh shit!\" moment without much self-analysis. My humble advice? Look inwards before telling us to \"calm down, dear\". The campaigner Anne Longfield OBE, 51, is chief executive of the charity 4Children and has worked in the field of child and family policy for over 25 years Most women didn't need the recent memo from No 10 to tell them that the coalition isn't yet firing on all cylinders when it comes to policies for women \u2013 either real or perceived. The charge list is well documented: the burden on women in budget cuts; cuts to child benefit (so soon in the administration, and with such seeming ease); reductions in support for childcare through tax credits. Whichever way you look at it, they all give the impression of a government that isn't giving much thought to women. Now, of course, women know that times are tough and understand the need for a strong economy. But women also know the way this will be achieved will be by building strong communities and families that are confident and able to fulfil their (and their country's) ambitions. And there are some green coalition shoots that could start to deliver some of this: commitments to become family-friendly, with a promised new \"family test\" across government, investment in the early years, support for parenting and flexible working. Yet they remain in their infancy, and when they are announced it's done so quietly, almost a little apologetically. So here is the challenge: if the coalition does want to make a difference, put these policies at the forefront."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
