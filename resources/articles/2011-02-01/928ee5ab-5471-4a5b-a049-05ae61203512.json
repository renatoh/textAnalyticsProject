Image: Marie Louise Ng, 26 January 2011 [velociraptorize]. Nikon D3s, 500/F4 Question: This Singaporean mystery bird is so gorgeous it'll make your eyes bleed. Can you identify the species? If you can't, can you make a guess as to its taxonomic order? Response: This is an adult male orange-bellied flowerpecker, Dicaeum trigonostigma, also known as the orange-breasted Flowerpecker. This species is a songbird (passeriformes) -- probably a safe guess since half of all bird species are placed into this taxonomic order. You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page. If you have bird images, video or mp3 files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative audience, feel free to email them to me for consideration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
