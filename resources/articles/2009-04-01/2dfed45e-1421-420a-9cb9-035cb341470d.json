Instead he scrambled home from Big Zeb, the second-favourite, who looked as if he could well have won but for a bad mistake at the final fence. Ruby Walsh set out to make the running from the start on Master Minded, which Paul Nicholls, his trainer, suggested afterwards might have played a part in the gelding's lacklustre performance. The favourite, he felt, was simply doing all he needed to in order to stay in front and would have been more impressive with a decent pace to chase. Nonetheless Master Minded looked a long way from the unbeatable champion who announced his arrival at the pinnacle of chasing with a 17-length win in the 2008 Champion Chase at Cheltenham. He was eased to evens, from 4-5, by Hill's to complete a hat-trick in next year's Champion Chase, while Big Zeb is now 8-1 (from 33-1) for the same race. \"All the way round he had his ears pricked and he wasn't doing a tap,\" Nicholls said. \"He was still idling all the way up the straight, so we'll put in something like Free World [when he runs] next year just to give him a lead. \"I told Ruby to go along in front to keep it uncomplicated but what he wants is a fast-run race. You don't want to be in that position with him in front. You learn about these horses all the time and we're still learning with him.\" Colm Murphy, the trainer of Big Zeb, will now try to coax enough improvement from his chaser to beat Master Minded next year. \"It's a pity to get so close and not quite get there but ours is still on the up and inexperienced, so we have something to look forward to,\" Murphy said. \"If he'd jumped the last, it might have been a different story.\" Walsh was completing a double on Master Minded following an effortless success in the Grade One Champion Novice Hurdle on Hurricane Fly, who missed the Cheltenham Festival with a leg injury but is clearly the most promising young hurdler around. Hurricane Fly had not seen a racecourse since beating Go Native by 10 lengths at Leopardstown's Christmas meeting, but was backed like a near-certainty throughout the day to set off as the 4-6 favourite. The race itself was spoiled by a desperately slow pace set by the outsider Fosters Cross until the closing stages, yet that only made it more impressive that Hurricane Fly eventually managed to speed seven lengths clear of Kempes in little more than a furlong. The winner's turn of foot should be a more potent weapon still on better ground and it was no great surprise to find Coral offering 5-2 for the Champion Hurdle afterwards. It was more of a shock, in fact, that Irish bookmakers Cashman's are still willing to lay 5-1. \"He did a piece of work with Ruby last week and I thought it was the best piece of work this horse has done all year,\" Mullins said. \"It was extraordinary. We just couldn't believe the way he came up the gallop. \"Often you see work at home and you're not sure if it's right or if the other horses have worked bad, but I think he proved there that it was right.\" Hurricane Fly has now won all three of his races for Mullins, all at Grade One level, and the only serious question that remains concerns his temperament. He had a distinctly edgy air about him after yesterday's race, which is typical of Montjeu's offspring, though at no stage did he threaten to boil over beforehand. \"Montjeu's are a bit that way but he was sensible enough before the race,\" Mullins said. \"It's always a concern but he's getting more mature as he's getting older. I'd expect we'll just put him away now but we won't make that decision until after Punchestown.\" Walsh was strongly backed to complete a treble on Cooldine, the RSA Chase winner, in the Boylesports Champion Novice Chase, but after making much of the running, he weakened quickly in the closing stages and could finish only fourth behind Rare Bob."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
