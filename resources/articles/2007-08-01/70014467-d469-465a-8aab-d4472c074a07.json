A report from the House of Lords science and technology select committee accuses both business and government of creating an image of the net as a \"wild west\", with millions of internet users unnecessarily exposed to crime. \"The internet is now increasingly the playground of criminals,\" the report says. \"Where a decade ago the public perception of the e-criminal was of a lonely hacker searching for attention, today's bad guys belong to organised crime groups, are highly skilful, specialised and focused on profit. They want to stay invisible, and so far they have largely succeeded.\" The result of a six-month committee investigation into online security suggests radical solutions including a new internet crime fighting police unit and an independent web regulator. The report attacks the received web wisdom that individual web surfers should be responsible for their security. \"You can't just rely on individuals to take responsibility for their own security. They will always be outfoxed by the bad guys,\" said committee chairman Lord Broers, a veteran of the technology industry and former vice-chancellor of Cambridge University. \"We feel many of the organisations profiting from internet services now need to take their share of the responsibility.\" The document accuses politicians of an outdated attitude to internet safety and an inability to prevent the spread of fear about internet crime. A recent survey showed that people were more fearful of having their online security compromised than they were of being mugged. Proposals include laboratories for investigating internet crime, in place of the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, disbanded during the creation of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency in 2006. A new police e-crime unit would also be supported by a website where members of the public could report cyber-crooks. Metropolitan police commander Sue Wilkinson told the committee that forces did not have enough resources or expertise to investigate all reports of internet-based crime. \"The scale is such that the police service would fall over if it tried to investigate every case,\" she said. \"I would hate any member of the public to feel that they can't report a crime, but people need to understand that each individual e-crime can't be investigated.\" Last month business leaders called for better support from the government and police as they struggle to cope with the increase in online crime. But the peers said banks and software companies had not given enough priority to the security of their customers. \"At the heart of this is establishing public trust in the internet and safeguarding citizens,\" said Nick Kalisperas, director of the IT trade group Intellect. \"We're very supportive of the report and its recommendations. But one area which is cause for serious concern is the idea of placing liability for security breaches on technology companies. We don't buy a car and then expect the manufacturer to pay up when it gets broken into.\" Last year identity theft and online fraud cost British consumers at least \u00a3414m, and the information commissioner has called the state of data protection \"frankly horrifying\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
