Collins Complete DIY Manual'", "bodyText": "The book I am currently reading Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead. I\u2019d had this book for a while, and in an uncharacteristic fit of tidiness I gave it away to Oxfam because I thought I wouldn\u2019t have time to read it. When I heard it had won the Nobel, I went to buy it back \u2013 alas it was gone, but a kind friend lent me his. It\u2019s wonderfully original, thrilling and chilling, with a protagonist definitely in need of cleaning tips. Tokarczuk\u2019s Flights is also very enjoyable. A new voice for us to listen out for. The book I didn\u2019t finish I gave up on Finnegans Wake by James Joyce. I thought it would be a doddle, because I did finish Ulysses and loved it. But Finnegans Wake was too much hard work, a bit self-indulgent, and besides, I don\u2019t know Dublin well enough. The last book that made me cry War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy always makes me cry in new places. This time it was the bit where young Petya dies. Tolstoy takes us into Petya\u2019s childlike and eager mind on the eve of battle and builds up to the moment of his death. This was almost the book I didn\u2019t finish, because tears blurred my eyes so much I couldn\u2019t read. The book I wish I\u2019d written Jonathan Coe\u2019s What a Carve Up! is funny, complex and angry \u2013 I wish I had written it! When you feel really angry about something, as I often do, it\u2019s good to take a few deep breaths and reach for humour, as Coe has done here. The book I give as a gift I\u2019ve lost count of the number of copies of The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver I\u2019ve given away. Come to think of it, I wish I\u2019d written that one, too. The book that influenced my writing I was most impressed by the cursing scene in Shame by Salman Rushdie. I saw how much colour a good curse can add to a piece of writing, and I set out to imitate it. The book that is most underrated Well, Collins Complete DIY Manual is not exactly underrated, because it has sold more than 3m copies since it came out in 1986. But I bet it\u2019s underrated by readers of the Guardian. The book that is most overrated Hinch Yourself Happy by Mrs Hinch. Honestly, how can a book subtitled \u201cAll the Best Cleaning Tips to Shine Your Sink and Soothe Your Soul\u201d make you happy? But on the other hand, perhaps I have something to learn \u2026 The book I\u2019m ashamed not to have read Well I\u2019m not going to tell everybody, am I? My comfort read I don\u2019t read for comfort so much as listen. I have the Elena Ferrante Neapolitan novels downloaded on Audible in case I have trouble falling asleep at bedtime, or wake up in the middle of the night. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter at which point I drop off or where I wake up, or even which book it is, because the reader\u2019s voice is hypnotic and it always seems to be the same characters having the same dilemmas. I tut impatiently or I nod off. The book that changed my life The witty and erudite Mona Lisa by Donald Sassoon, because I fell in love with the author. \u2022 Marina Lewycka\u2019s The Good, the Bad and the Little Bit Stupid is published by Fig Tree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
