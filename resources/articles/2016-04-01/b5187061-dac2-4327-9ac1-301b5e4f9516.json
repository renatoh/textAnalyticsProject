The 20-year-old Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach player has attracted widespread interest during his breakthrough season in the Bundesliga, where he has starred alongside captain and the Arsenal target Granit Xhaka. J\u00fcrgen Klopp is among those pursuing Dahoud\u2019s signature as the Liverpool manager embarks on a summer rebuilding programme at Anfield. Dahoud, a Germany under-21 international of Syrian descent, has enjoyed an outstanding season with M\u00f6nchengladbach, who would be reluctant to sell both the youngster and Xhaka but may relent should a bidding war lead to offers of around \u20ac30m for the former. Dortmund have been repeatedly linked with the talented central midfielder with the futures of Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in doubt. But Klopp will rival his former club and Liverpool\u2019s Europa League quarter-final opponents for the former Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf player, who is aware of interest from Anfield. The Liverpool manager has already utilised his Bundesliga background to sign the central defender Jo\u00ebl Matip on a free transfer from Schalke and wants a reunion with Mario G\u00f6tze, who enjoyed the best period of his career so far under Klopp at Dortmund. Liverpool are confident of prising G\u00f6tze from Bayern Munich for between \u00a315m and \u00a320m this summer. The club has also added to its midfield ranks for next season by securing another highly rated youngster, 19-year-old Marko Grujic, from Red Star Belgrade for \u00a35.1m. Dahoud would cost considerably more and the pursuit underlines Klopp\u2019s intent to overhaul Liverpool\u2019s central midfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
