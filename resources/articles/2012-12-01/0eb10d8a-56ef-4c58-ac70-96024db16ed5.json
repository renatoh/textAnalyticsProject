Don't read on if you haven't seen episode 11 \u2013 and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers. Catch up with Rebecca Nicholson's episode 10 blog In Memoriam This episode was supposed to be called The Motherfucker In The Turban. Unsurprisingly, it is no longer called that. I wonder what prompted the last-minute change? If this was Old Homeland I've have thought the original a wry dig at US attitudes; this time around, it could easily have been gung-ho patriotism, so perhaps that swap was for the best. For a penultimate instalment, this had an odd pace \u2013 it felt like a lot of Big Things happened with the death of Abu Nazir, but the action was also disjointed and, dare I say it, slow. I'd got used to the bonkers pace of this series \u2013 indeed, this felt like the payoff for Homeland losing its senses, plot-wise \u2013 but this didn't quite work for me. The fact that the big story now is whether the CIA will bump off Brody or not just doesn't have the import of the season one finale, and the muted, bruised romance of Brody and Carrie isn't the reason I like the show. Mind you, I'm a fan of Quinn, even if he is black ops and deadly. He's the only one Carrie listens to any more, so I hope he gets to stay for season three. Carrie The writers seemed to remember who Carrie actually was for at least a portion of this episode, which was a relief \u2013 she took her medication in the car, a reminder that she is fallible and that the trauma of the past day did have an impact. There was also a suggestion that she might be losing her grip on reality, too, as she emerged from the tunnel for the first time. I did wonder for a second if Abu Nazir had really been there, or if it was in her mind, as Quinn seemed to think, too. I also enjoyed the interrogation of Roya. Carrie's gently persuasive, do-the-right-thing approach has been unfeasibly successful so far \u2013 it was great to see that she was no match for the sheer rage of her adversary. Yet there were also many un-Carrie moments. Returning to the tunnels not once but twice, with nothing but a flashlight, was very Sarah Lund of her. Her lies to Quinn about how she got away from Nazir \u2013 \"I escaped\" \u2013 were rubbish. And then there was the moment that caused me to scream at the screen, regarding Galvez being the mole: \"He is a Muslim.\" The metamorphosis to Carrie Bauer is complete. She would never have made such a glib assumption in season one, and it doesn't matter that she was wrong. Now that she's had her car crash and been roughed up, and fixed it all with a quick splash of water in the CIA bathroom, she's left with romance. For all of their mutual damage, Brody and Carrie get each other. Considering the bleakness of her season one finale, perhaps it is only fair that she gets a shot at happiness this time. Though if Quinn has anything to do with it, there is more darkness to come. Brody For the first time, I thought the scenes between Jess and Brody were expertly done, particularly when they were alone. Though chucking them into the Abu Nazir action felt off in terms of the flow, this was a moving portrait of a marriage in its death throes. I haven't always been a fan of Morena Baccarin in this series, but she more than held her own here (which is more than can be said for Dana's cereal-based teenage meltdown). It was inevitable that Brody would end up with Carrie, and Jess knew it. That ending did make me consider the crazy pacing of the series, though. It was mere episodes ago that Carrie had Brody on the floor, and was calling him a disgrace to his nation, furious that he'd subjected her to unnecessary shock therapy. They do say that love conquers all; I just didn't realise it happened so completely and so quickly. Notes and observations \u2022 If anyone has fashioned a drinking game for Dana's eye-rolls, I trust we're all suitably sloshed. \u2022 Saul, as always, brings the class to the series. As far as I can recall, he isn't normally one for bad language, but this week, he was so angry that he was swearing like a trooper. \u2022 Evil Estes setting him up to take the fall for Aileen's suicide was dreadful, but why doesn't Saul blow the lid on the Brody plot or indeed the drone strike coverup? What does he have to lose now? \u2022 Carrie's huge eyes at the start of the episode deserve their own spin-off series. \u2022 It was very dark, but why didn't the specially trained military team of eight crack soldiers spot Nazir hiding behind a grate? Why did it take Carrie's \"sixth sense\", as Estes put it, to sniff him out? \u2022 It's a bit ludicrous to suggest that now Nazir is dead, everyone's completely safe again. I'm no expert but I'm guessing terrorism isn't quite as straightforward as that. \u2022 The shot of Nazir on his knees in front of the soldiers looked stunning. \u2022 I really hope the season finale ups its game. So far, there is only the prospect of whether Brody gets bumped off or not to keep us going (I also wonder if Carrie is a risk \u2013 there were a couple of Estes looks that suggested she may not be safe either). Ideally, I'd like some surprise double-crossing, a huge explosion of some kind, and a little bit of a concession to the fact that this was once one of the smartest shows on the box."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
