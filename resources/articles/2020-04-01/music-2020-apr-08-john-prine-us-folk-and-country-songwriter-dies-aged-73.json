Prine was hospitalised on 26 March, and was in intensive care for 13 days before dying on Tuesday, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee. Prine\u2019s family confirmed his death to several US media outlets including The New York Times, Rolling Stone and Variety. \u201cWe join the world in mourning the passing of revered country and folk singer/songwriter John Prine,\u201d the Recording Academy said in a written statement. \u201cWidely lauded as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, John\u2019s impact will continue to inspire musicians for years to come. We send our deepest condolences to his loved ones.\u201d On Twitter, Bruce Springsteen wrote: \u201cWe are crushed by the loss of John Prine. John and I were \u2018New Dylans\u2019 together in the early 70s and he was never anything but the loveliest guy in the world. A true national treasure and a songwriter for the ages.\u201d Prine was born and raised on the outskirts of Chicago, and, on either side of a spell in the US army working as a mechanic in Germany, had a day job as a mail carrier while playing guitar and writing songs as a hobby. At a Chicago open mic night, he was heard complaining about the lack of talent on stage and was challenged to do better by one of the performers; his rapturously received three-song set earned him a $1,000-a-weekend residency and allowed him to quit the postal service. His career was given a boost by Kristofferson, who saw him play in Chicago. When Prine was visiting New York, Kristofferson invited him to play a gig for a room of record-label staff \u2013 Prine was signed to Atlantic Records the next morning. \u201cLuck has a good deal to do with it, luck and timing,\u201d he said of his swift success. \u201cBut when the luck and timing comes along, you\u2019ve got to have the goods.\u201d He released his debut album in 1971, and put out 19 studio albums in all. While wider mainstream success eluded him for years, he earned a sizeable following, including some of the 20th century\u2019s greatest songwriters. Bob Dylan said in 2009: \u201cPrine\u2019s stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs.\u201d Bonnie Raitt has celebrated his songwriting as \u201cdeceptively insightful. It\u2019s at once playing on words and imagery, but expressing something deeper in such a succinct way, in such an exceptional way.\u201d Today, she said she was \u201ccrushed by the loss\u201d. Johnny Cash once described him as one of his personal \u201cbig four\u201d songwriters alongside Guy Clark, Steve Goodman and Rodney Crowell, while ex-Pink Floyd member Roger Waters called him \u201cextraordinarily eloquent\u201d. Prine won two Grammy awards from 11 nominations, and was also given a lifetime achievement award at the 2020 ceremony. In 2016 he recorded a duets album For Better, or Worse with singers including Alison Krauss, Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert, and became his biggest chart hit then to date, reaching No 30 in the US charts. He outdid its success in 2018 with The Tree of Forgiveness, which reached No 5. Prine twice suffered from cancer. In 1996, he had part of his neck removed due to squamous cell carcinoma, and required speech therapy to be able to perform again. In 2013, he had lung cancer, and recovered following surgery. He had a small role in the 2001 Billy Bob Thornton-directed movie Daddy and Them, and years earlier had met with Dustin Hoffman after a producer suggested they work together on screen despite Prine never having acted before. \u201cFinally, [Hoffman] said: \u2018Well, how did you get here? And I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know. Maybe somebody boinked your secretary\u2019. I never heard from him again,\u201d Prine remembered in his 2015 biography. Further tributes were paid by filmmaker Michael Moore, astronaut Chris Hadfield, and Stephen King, who called him \u201cone of the great ones\u201d. Robert Plant described Prine as \u201ca beacon of clear white light cutting through the dark days. His charm, humour and irony we shall miss greatly\u201d. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea heralded \u201call those warm songs that cut their own path through a tangled world\u201d. Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith called him \u201ca sort of Mark Twain figure. A humorist but mainly a humanist. He could make you laugh one moment and rip your heart open in the next.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
