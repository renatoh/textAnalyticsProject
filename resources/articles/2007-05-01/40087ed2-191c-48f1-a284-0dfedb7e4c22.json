The risk emerged yesterday when it was announced that motor racing's governing body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), will investigate whether rules were broken. Specifically it is expected to examine radio transmissions from the McLaren pit to their two drivers to establish whether instructions to hold position after the second round of refuelling stops amounted to an infraction. \"The FIA has launched an investigation into incidents involving the McLaren-Mercedes team at the 2007 Monaco grand prix in light of a possible breach of the international sporting code,\" the governing body said. Even if the drivers escape disqualification McLaren may face a significant fine or even suspension from races. Team orders which influence the outcome of a race result were banned at the end of 2002 after Rubens Barrichello was instructed to hand the lead of that year's Austrian grand prix to his Ferrari team leader Michael Schumacher to protect the German driver's world championship lead. Schumacher then compounded the offence by beckoning Barrichello to take the winner's place on the podium, which drew jeers from the crowd and embarrassed the Austrian chancellor Dr Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, who presented the trophies. For disrupting the podium ceremony the Ferrari drivers were jointly fined $1m, half payable immediately and half suspended for 12 months in case of a repeat. Max Mosley, the FIA president, also wanted to impose a fine for the team orders that led to the debacle but ultimately decided that the drivers' contractual obligations precluded such a sanction. \"The FIA world motorsport council deplores the manner in which team orders were given and executed at the Austrian grand prix,\" he said. At that time the FIA also recognised \"the long standing and traditional right of a team to determine the finishing order of its drivers in what it believes to be the best interests of its attempts to win both world championships\". That all changed at the end of the 2002 season when the ban on team orders was imposed. No team has run foul of that ban until now. Part of the problem at Monaco was that Hamilton and Alonso, the eventual winner, started the 78-lap race on different fuel loads to cover every strategic possibility. \"If the safety car is deployed then a one-stop refuelling strategy will almost certainly beat a two-stop strategy,\" said the McLaren team principal, Ron Dennis, alluding to the fact that the car would use less fuel by going more slowly. \"If there is no safety car deployed then a two-stop strategy is the best. Because of the difficulties involved in passing, Monaco is the only circuit on which the issue of the safety car determines who wins. \"At the end of the day McLaren has now won an all-time record 14 out of the 65 races at Monaco. And why? Because McLaren understands better than anybody what's involved in winning there.\" Alonso was on a two-stop strategy from the outset whereas Hamilton started with a one-stop plan, carrying five laps more fuel than Alonso. He was brought in for his first refuelling stop only three laps after the Spaniard because he was not close enough to have a chance of resuming in the lead, and since he was comfortably second the team switched him to a two-stop strategy because it was the fastest option for the balance of the race."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
