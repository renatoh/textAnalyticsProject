Scott Morrison is posing a mind-focusing question, one I haven\u2019t seen a prime minister pose before, and the question is this: does parliament matter? Do the institutions and conventions of politics matter? Our story needs to start with the bubble. Morrison\u2019s deliberate devaluing of his own ecosystem, the vocation of politics, began with creating a crime scene, then distancing himself from it. Donald Trump had the swamp. Morrison invoked the bubble. Canberra was the bubble. The bubble works, conceptually, as a brand, because a lot of voters believe it exists. Because voters feel alienated by politics, and perceive a lot of what goes on in parliament as either derangement or rank self-indulgence, Morrison can invoke the bad place, plausibly, and style himself as the person to set it right. Bad business, that bubble. Just as well I showed up. Morrison\u2019s bubble is multipurpose: both sword, shield, and safety deposit box. The bubble is invoked to malign conduct from opponents he finds inconvenient, and to deflect questions he doesn\u2019t want to answer. Anything not to the prime minister\u2019s liking can also be confined to the bubble. That\u2019s a bubble preoccupation. A bubble question. Don\u2019t waste my valuable time. Don\u2019t expect an answer. You\u2019d laugh at the audacity of all this, it would be a hoot, this jape, except it\u2019s not funny. The bubble language is not invoked constructively, to try and drag a rancid, rotting institution into self-correction and catharsis. It is invoked predominantly to mark people as occupants of various tribes \u2013 the pantomime people and the practical people \u2013 and pit them against one another. Apart from divide and conquer, the oldest trope in politics, there\u2019s another dimension to Morrison\u2019s rolling parable of the bubble-dwellers versus everyone else, and it became profoundly obvious during the final two rancorous parliamentary sitting weeks of 2019. Think about it. If Canberra is a bubble comprised of washed up high school debaters and circus performers, if you can make that reality stick, then none of what happens in that arena matters. Foundational conventions of politics and the parliament get presented as sideshows or cheap power plays, rather than important accountability mechanisms to protect Australian citizens from abuses of power. In the universe where anything is possible and nothing matters, it doesn\u2019t matter if the prime minister misleads the parliament (which he did on several occasions in this past fortnight). Why worry about nitpickers? Just write a letter to the Speaker cleaning it up, or don\u2019t even bother. It doesn\u2019t matter if the prime minister phones the New South Wales police commissioner in the middle of an investigation into one of his ministers. (Boutique issue, only troubling the goat\u2019s cheese circle). It doesn\u2019t matter if Naomi Wolf says categorically she was not at Oxford in 1991 and Angus Taylor tells parliament he absolutely met her and \u201cshe began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago\u201d. (Close enough, right? Why sweat the small stuff?) If no one is required to be precise, or accurate, then it doesn\u2019t matter if Taylor keeps tripping over himself, again and again, making mistakes ministers should not make, and suffers no apparently penalty, because this is a bubble issue. A kabuki play. Sound and fury signifying nothing. If it\u2019s all nonsense, then it doesn\u2019t matter if you treat question time as a joke, requiring backbenchers to stand up like a procession of ventriloquist dummies with scripts prefaced with \u201chow great is our strong and stable government, prime minister\u201d, or \u201chow fabulous and confident is Australia with you, sir, oh great one, at the helm\u201d \u2013 because that feeds the appearance of pantomime, artifice and spectacle, which reinforces the voter alienation, which creates more opportunity for Morrison to validate that frustration, and style himself as the antidote. The bottom line is this: if you can sit at the pinnacle of your institution, if you can orchestrate this sideshow, while telling onlookers your institution is busted, worthless, and meaningless, you create opportunity and space to write your own rules. There are no guard rails. You can defy gravity. People who line up to ask questions, be they journalists or other political actors, are just irritants to be batted away rather than ramparts in a democratic system. There are two problems with this. The first is just obvious: why should voters trust a prime minister to write their own rules? I wouldn\u2019t trust any prime minister to do that, whether I respected them or whether I didn\u2019t. Conventions \u2013 like the requirement not to mislead the parliament, to answer questions, to insist on ministerial accountability, or to steer clear of police looking at conduct in your government \u2013 exist for a reason. They exist to allow power in a democracy to be both exercised and appropriately checked. Post global financial crisis politics has taught me that democratic institutions are more fragile than they look. It is vitally important that we stand up for our institutions and conventions through this period of realignment in global politics. These things stand between us and chaos. That\u2019s not a hyperventilation on my part, that\u2019s just the reality. Any passing glance at the great democracies of the world will tell you that. Quite apart from the fundamental belief I have that democracy, and its trappings, is the only thing better than the alternative, there is another danger associated with prime ministers making their own reality, and requiring whole systems to bend to it. Long term, it\u2019s not in their interests. That way lies hubris. That way lies overreach. That way lies justifying unjustifiable things. That way lies misjudgments. That way lies the thin edge of the wedge. While it\u2019s obvious this behaviour isn\u2019t desirable, unfortunately it is rational. At one level, the times do suit Morrison\u2019s disdain-the-citadel approach, which is presumably why the prime minister has adopted it. I said a moment ago Morrison is pitching into a crisis of trust in institutions, and I think it was Churchill who said never waste a good crisis. Politicians can both suffer and profit in this environment, depending on their level of dexterity. It\u2019s also entirely possible that Morrison has chosen to present Canberra as a circus act and a distraction because he can afford to do that. Political parties don\u2019t win elections now because of the pitches that are made at the dispatch box in Canberra, because of impressions that are forged in the parliament \u2013 which was how things played out in the television age. In the digital age, elections are won by developing ever more sophisticated ground games and by direct messaging. What Morrison\u2019s MPs are doing and saying on the ground \u2013 combined with this curated derring-do prime ministerial character called Scott that the Liberal party projects through social media like a hologram \u2013 is probably more important to the Coalition\u2019s long-term electoral prospects than what is or isn\u2019t happening in Canberra during sitting weeks. I say probably, because while Morrison and the team around him act like people who think accountability is a speed bump on the superhighway to the dear leader\u2019s permanent prime ministership, I\u2019m not entirely convinced that we\u2019ve entered a consequence-free world. Perhaps this is the journalist in me, hoping against hope we haven\u2019t entered a consequence-free world, because the consequence-free world means there is no point to my public service. In a consequence-free world, all I\u2019m doing is stoking the cacophony. But, as they say in the classics, only time will tell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
