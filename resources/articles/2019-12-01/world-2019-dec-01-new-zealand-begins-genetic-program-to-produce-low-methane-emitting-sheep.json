There are about six sheep for each person in New Zealand, and the livestock industry accounts for about one-third of the country\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions. The livestock industry\u2019s peak body, Beef and Lamb New Zealand, already uses a measure called \u201cbreeding value\u201d to help breeders select rams with characteristics they want to bolster within their flocks. Within two years breeders will be able to select rams whose traits include lower methane emissions. \u201cFarmers are more interested than I anticipated,\u201d said a stud breeder, Russell Proffit. His family has been producing rams for more than 40 years. \u201cI\u2019ve undertaken the [methane] measurements because I believe an animal that is healthy and doing well should produce less methane and I wanted to test that. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case yet, but either way breeding for less methane complements what we are working to achieve on our stud. That is, more robust rams that require [fewer] inputs and make less demand on the environment.\u201d Breeders who want to produce low-methane rams will need to measure a portion of their flock in an accumulation chamber, where their gas emissions are measured. Sheep spend 50 minutes in the chamber, and must be measured twice with an interval of more than 14 days. The resulting data is used alongside other genetic information to calculate a \u201cmethane breeding value\u201d. Farmers who want to participate are expected to have access to breeding rams within two years, given the time it takes to breed the rams on a commercial scale. The pastoral greenhouse gas research consortium, which is jointly funded by the agricultural sector and the government, said the concept was to take advantage of variations in levels of methane emissions and research that found the differences were passed on to the next generation. \u201cThis is a global first for any species of livestock,\u201d the consortium\u2019s general manager, Mark Aspin, said. \u201cLaunching the methane breeding value gives New Zealand\u2019s sheep sector a practical tool to help lower our agricultural greenhouse gases. This is significant. Up until now, the only option available to farmers wanting to lower their greenhouse gas emissions has been to constantly improve their overall farming efficiency. \u201cThis takes us a step further \u2013 towards actually lowering sheep methane emissions, in keeping with the sector\u2019s commitment to work towards reducing its greenhouse emissions.\u201d Progress via breeding could be about 1% a year, but it would be cumulative and have no negative impact on farm productivity. Aspin said amounts of feed were the biggest factor that contributed to methane emissions, and the consortium was working on three technologies that aimed to reduce amounts of methane generated by feed. \u201cSo by breeding sheep that produce less methane per mouthful eaten \u2013 as other methane-reducing technologies come on stream \u2013 the influence of these sheep on the national flock\u2019s methane production becomes compounding.\u201d Beef and Livestock New Zealand\u2019s chief executive, Sam McIvor, said recent research of 1,000 farmers found that information about reducing greenhouse emissions was among farmers\u2019 top five priorities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
