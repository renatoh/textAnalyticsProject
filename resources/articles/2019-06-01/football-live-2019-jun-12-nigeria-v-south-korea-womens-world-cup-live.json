Nigeria play France next but stand every chance of reaching the last 16. It\u2019s been fun, take care all! So a great day for Nigerian fans, not so much for their opponents. But everyone should watch a replay of the second goal from the brilliant Asisat Oshoala. A real example of how to finish... A massive win for the Super Falcons. They needed that. But it looks like goodbye to South Korea... 90+3 A scything challenge from Chikwelu ends another attack in its tracks but South Korea waste the free kick. They look thoroughly beaten unfortunately 90 mins Another tame shot from South Korea ends up in the Nigerian goalkeeper\u2019s hands. They have been really disappointing in the final third. Four minutes of stoppage time to go 89 mins It\u2019s been a solid defensive display by the Nigerians today, with Nnadozie showing no signs of nerves. She denies Yeo Min-ji after a clever swivel in the box 87 mins South Korea going down fighting here at least. But Moon\u2019s header at the back post is well saved by Chiamaka Nnadozie 84 mins Cho wins a corner as Oshoala comes off the pitch. She has showed her class today 81 mins Anam Imo has come on for Nigeria to exploit the spaces being left at the back. She\u2019s the third 18-year-old to feature today for the Super Falcons 79 mins Almost another there but Oshoala\u2019s touch deserted her in the box. South Korea hanging on now 78 mins Superb stuff from Oshoala to stay on her feet there and put the ball in from a very tight angle - that\u2019s the first time since 1999 that Nigeria have scored twice at the World Cup. This one is surely in the bag now... A lovely break from Nigeria and the Barcelona striker does the rest. Brilliant finish after taking the ball around the keeper 73 mins There\u2019s not been enough zip on the passing today from South Korea and that has left them vulnerable to losing the ball. Chiamaka Nnadozie just about deals with a cross from the right. She\u2019s looked pretty calm for a teenager making her debut! 70 mins Cho So-hyun is in the wars again for South Korea after clashing with Ayinde. Then Ebi goes down heavily for Nigeria. They are slowing the game down well here 68 mins You can feel the frustration growing among the South Korean players. Time is running out for them now.... 66 mins Another corner sees the chance of an equaliser go begging after Moon\u2019s effort was blocked. Halimatu Ayinde comes on for the Super Falcons as they look to steady the ship 62 mins Cho So-hyun received treatement after a heavy clash in midfield. Thankfully she looks ok now and play is carrying on. South Korea have a corner... 59 mins Goal disallowed for South Korea! The cross was fired across and a poor save from Chiamaka Nnadozie presented the ball to Lee Geum-min, who touched the ball in but was then flagged for being offside. Another excellent decision... 57 mins The pressure is building on Nigeria as South Korea come forward. They look capable of scoring but also vulnerable on the break. An intriguing contest. And here come two replacements for South Korea - Yeo Min-ji and Moon Mi-ra onto the pitch 50 mins A looping header from Desire Oparanozie just goes over the bar at the other end. For a moment some in the stadium thought it was in. But not quite... 48 mins Ji So-yun stepping up the pressure here with some driving runs from midfield. But she goes down in the box looking for a penalty and is rightly shown a yellow card by the referee. Good decision. That was a bit embarrassing from the Chelsea star 46 mins We\u2019re back underway in Grenoble, a massive half coming up for both sides... An own-goal from Kim Do-yeon separates these two at the break - a disappointing moment for the South Koreans after they bossed the opening exchanges. They have it all to do in the second half if they are to remain in the competition... 45+2 South Korea have a sniff of an equaliser but it comes to nothing again 44 mins Asisat Oshoala has a first sniff of goal but can\u2019t quite get on the end of the cross. South Korea living on the edge here slightly. 42 mins A better corner but it\u2019s cleared by South Korea. It looks pretty hot there in the foothills of the Alps, I wonder how long they can keep this pace up later on? 40 mins Nigeria almost paid for their slackness as South Korea tried to force the ball in via Kang Yu-mi but Nigeria go up the other end and win another corner... 39 mins A poor corner sails out of play as the opportunity goes begging 38 mins South Korea are trying to respond to that shock but Nigeria have grown in confidence since the goal and have a corner... 34 mins It took an age for them to decide whether that goal should stand because it looked like Desire Oparanozie stuck out a hand after a long ball forward from the back was accidently turned into her own net by Kim Do-yeon. The VAR eventually decided that she didn\u2019t touch it so the goal stands... 29 mins That is disastrous for South Korea 25 mins Some risky defending from Nigeria almost ends in a chance at the other end but the Russian referee calls a foul. They definitely look a threat on the break 23 mins More pressure from South Korea sees Lee Min-a\u2019s shot just go wide from long range. They are certainly knocking on the door 19 mins Lee Geum-min finally tests 18-year-old goalkeeper Nnadozie for the first time after an excellent move but the shot is straight at her and she makes an easy save. 15 mins The red shirts continuing to dominate possession here but Nigeria look organised at the back just now. Sticksports Fan reckons they are up against it though today - they have this down as a South Korea win... 9 mins Good save from Kim Min-jeong to deny Desire Oparanozie. The cross came in from the left but the keeper was equal to the task. 7 min Half a chance for South Korea as Jang Sel-gi shoots wide follwoing a nice passing move. They then win a corner but that also comes to nothing. Impressive so far from the Asian side, who are pinning their opponents back. 3 min A mistake from teenage keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie almost sets up South Korea for the opening goal but her blushes are saved... Peep! And we\u2019re off. South Korea imemdiatley pump the ball down to 18-year-old replacement right back Chidinma Okeke but she heads away. She is in for the injured Faith Michael. Nigeria definitely winning on the kit front I think. They\u2019re in a snazzy green number while South Korea don their traditional red shirts and black shorts. The niceties are out of the way, let\u2019s play! And here come the teams... \u201cThis game is all about avoiding an early exit from the 2019 World Cup,\u201d says the commentator. Too right. Should be very interesting... And a shout out to StickSports Fan, who correctly predicted that Sweden would win 2-0 against Chile yesterday. Well done you. What you saying for today I wonder? I\u2019m going for 1-1. While we\u2019re waiting... there\u2019s been much debate about last night\u2019s whopping 13-0 win for USA over Thailand, with many saying they should perhaps not have celebrated so wildly when so far in front. Here\u2019s three former Canada players ripping into their neighbours. Pretty brutal stuff... Looking forward to seeing Nigeria\u2019s Asisat Oshoala on the right of their 4-3-3. She\u2019s just joined Barcelona on a permanent deal after scoring in the Champions League final defeat while on loan. Meanwhile, Chelsea playmaker Ji So-yun will be the key to their chances of picking up a win in Grenoble this afternoon. She found it tough against France but should be able to find some space today to work her magic. The starting XIs are in... Welcome. It\u2019s a massive day if you are fans of Nigeria or South Korea, with both sides desperate for a result after losing their opening game at this year\u2019s World Cup. The Super Falcons have gone more than four hours without scoring in a finals while South Korea were poor in the match against hosts France and have never kept a clean sheet in a World Cup match! Let\u2019s hope for something better today from them... Kick-off: 2pm BST, 3pm CET."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
