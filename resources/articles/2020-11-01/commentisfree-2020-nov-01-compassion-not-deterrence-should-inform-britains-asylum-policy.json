At least 800 drown. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to close our eyes again and only commemorate these events later,\u201d says Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi. 2 September 2015 The body of a three-year-old Syrian toddler, Alan Kurdi, washes up on a Turkish beach. The prime minister, David Cameron, is \u201cdeeply moved\u201d and says Britain \u201cwill fulfil our moral responsibilities\u201d. 27 October 2020 A family of Iranian Kurds drown in the Channel. One study suggests that 300 people may have died in the Channel since 1999. There has been much shock at the latest deaths of migrants attempting to cross the Channel. There should, however, be no surprise. What is happening in the Channel is what has been happening in the Mediterranean for 25 years. The trouble is, Britain\u2019s response is also the same as the EU\u2019s, a policy of \u201cdeterrence\u201d that has signally failed in either deterring migrants or in preventing deaths. Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, like their EU counterparts, place all the blame on people smugglers. Smugglers are often venal and vile. They are, though, not the cause of the problem but the products of immigration policy. One reason people take to crossing the Channel is that they can apply for asylum only on British soil. So long as deterrence is the only policy, that list of deaths will continue to rise. And politicians will continue saying \u201cthis must never happen again\u201d, knowing full well that it will happen again. And again. And again. It\u2019s a shameful approach that needs challenging now. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
