Strict quarantine measures and border closures have been imposed by trusted lieutenants including the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, and the new prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, with officials leading parallel efforts to contain the virus and its economic fallout. Putin, meanwhile, has mainly focused on cushioning the financial blow to Russians during teleconferences or in televised speeches from an empty office, a difficult perch from which to appear to be managing a crisis that he has seemed keen to hand off. It is an unusual state of affairs in Russia, where political decisions radiate out from the centre, and where ordinary Russians are also coming to terms with scant supplies of medical masks, mounting economic troubles and the simple monotony of life under quarantine. Businesses have clamoured for more government aid, including a release of Russia\u2019s financial reserves. \u201cStop waiting for some mythical Putin to come and save you,\u201d said Yevgenia Albats, the editor of the independent New Times magazine, when asked about aid on the popular Echo of Moscow radio station this week. \u201cOnly you can do it,\u201d she said. Putin has avoided public gatherings since late March, days after donning a yellow safety suit to visit Moscow\u2019s main hospital for coronavirus patients. While there, he shook hands and spoke with the head doctor later diagnosed with the disease. The Kremlin has said that Putin is not sick and is working remotely, but the encounter raised questions of whether Russia\u2019s president was also self-isolating, following other leaders such as Angela Merkel and Justin Trudeau. On Wednesday, Putin gave a publicly televised speech calling for bonuses for nurses and doctors caring for Covid-19 patients, and calling the next two to three weeks \u201cdecisive\u201d in Russia\u2019s battle with the disease. Calling upon Russians to unite, Putin compared the country\u2019s fight with coronavirus to battles with enemies from the 10th and 11th centuries, an eccentric choice that left many Russians searching the Internet. \u201cDear friends!\u201d he said. \u201cEverything passes, and this too will pass. Our country has repeatedly passed through serious tests: the Pechenegs tormented it, and the Cumans too. Russia defeated all of them. We will also defeat this coronavirus infection. Together we will overcome everything.\u201d The appeal to unity came at an important moment, as Putin\u2019s previous addresses had fallen flat. After he introduced a \u201cnon-working week\u201d in late March, Russians flocked to barbecues in local parks, leading Moscow\u2019s mayor to introduce a tough self-isolation regime, emphasising it was not a holiday. Other Kremlin reports of Putin\u2019s activities have been even stranger. After telling the press that Putin was working remotely and not shaking hands, the Kremlin released a video on Monday showing the president receiving two ministers at the Kremlin and kicking off the exchange with a hearty handshake. The three men did not mention the coronavirus once during the encounter, fuelling rumours it had been filmed earlier and then released this week. Oleg Kashin, a prominent Russian journalist, said it appeared to be \u201cpreserves\u201d, the Russian term for pre-packaged content the Kremlin sometimes releases days or weeks after an event. Putin\u2019s televised appearance on Wednesday \u2013 where he made a direct call on regional heads to develop new measures to help Russians \u2013 may indicate he plans to take a more hands-on approach to the crisis. Analysts have noted that Putin\u2019s approach mirrored some other countries, where local officials are tasked with enforcing tough regulations and the central government delivers economic stimulus. The approach would limit Putin\u2019s exposure to unpopular decisions and preserve his public support. There was another possibility, wrote Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst and head of the R.Politik analysis firm: Putin simply does not see tackling the virus as his job. Unfortunately, she added, the state machinery \u201chas forgotten how to act independently\u201d. \u201cThe president expects efficiency from his subordinates, but they have gotten used to merely implementing decisions made by others, and have now forgotten how to generate their own,\u201d she wrote in a piece published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
