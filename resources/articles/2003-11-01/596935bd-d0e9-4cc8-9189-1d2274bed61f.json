SULPHUROUS NEW FACTORY OPENS IN BARNSLEY Next time you sink your teeth into an egg mayonnaise sandwich, you can congratulate yourself on doing a good turn to Barnsley. The world's biggest egg-boiling plant is being set up in the South Yorkshire town in what local business people describe to the local Evening Star as \"exciting times.\" Just to bring you that slurpy filling, occasionally with the contrasting crunch of cress (or could it be a calcium-rich morsel of shell?) is going to require 70 new jobs, from hygiene workers to quality assurance technologists. All must presumably be immune to the unique fragrance of the boiling egg, which has barred this delicious snack, complete with salt in a twist of foil, from Wainwright family picnics ever since our sons were born. But the factory's arrival is a nice replacement for Barnsley's lost crown as global leader in making tennis balls, which is now done more cheaply in the far east. It's also a small piece of evidence to counter the general impression given in the national media that \"olde\" jobs are losing out everywhere to hi-tech IT skills. The egg boilers are moving in on a site recently left empty by a shut-down electronics factory. GIMME A SHELTER Ancient northern skills are also on show in Cleveleys, near Blackpool, where tenacious pensioners Harry Cook, 89, and his sidekick Adelaide Cowie, 75, are stepping up their battle for a new tram shelter. \"Both rely heavily on the Blackpool Transport tram system,\" according to the Blackpool Citizen, but the clanking machines' operators have left them and the rest of Cleveleys out in the cold. The controversy centres on the demolished shelter in the town's Victoria Square, whose cast iron pillars were allegedly getting as wobbly as some of the trams' older users. In a legal dispute which could become as famous as Jarndyce vs Jarndyce in Dickens' Bleak House, two rival councils are divided over the difference - or similarity - between a tram and a bus. A spokeswoman for Blackpool, which runs the trams, says that tram shelters are legally the same as bus shelters which are always provided by the local council - in Cleveleys case an authority called Wyre Borough. But a spokesman for Wyre does not concede the point and says: \"The responsibility rests with Blackpool because they demolished the old shelter.\" As the first frosts turned Cleveleys into a winter wonderland, a compromise seemed briefly possible when Blackpool offered to build a new shelter if they could cover it with money-earning billboards. Wyre, however, torpedoed that by arguing that this threatened health and safety for tram passengers, because adverts might distract the argosies' drivers and obscure their view.* Mr Cook, meanwhile, tells the Citizen: \"If I was a bit younger, I'd go out there and do the job myself.\" Since he was formerly a chemical engineer at British Nuclear Fuels, this offer should be taken seriously (and might result in an interesting and distinctive shelter for Victoria Square). ODDBOTTLE AND THE CHEROKEES GO TO WAR While Blackpool's spokeswoman and Wyre's spokesman go head-to-head, a similar struggle between the genders apparently enlivened a grudge football league match in Hull's Sunday League between Oddbottle and the Cherokees. Bad tempered play reached a climax, records the Hull Daily Mail from the city's magistrates court, when Oddbottle's goalie stormed the length of the pitch to headbutt the woiman referee and denounce her as a lesbian. The goalie, a Mr Bunn, intervened after a penalty in the 89th minute led to amazing scenes, with players fighting and spectators leaving the touchline to join in what the lawyers described as a free-for-all. In the general mayhem, the referee Jayne Cameron-McLane was allegedly knocked sideways, called an effing dyke and then lied to by Mr Bunn, when she took out her book to report him and he gave his name only as \"Mr Smith.\" The ref told the magistrates that she was off her guard and trying to extract some children who had somehow got involved in the fighting, but Mr Bunn, or Smith, did not accept that version of events. He told the court - which is still making up its mind - that he had fallen over and on standing up, threw his arms back, unfortunately clocking Ms Cameron-McLane in the process. \"I'm a great believer in equal rights,\" he told prosecution lawyers, who charged him with believing that Hull Sunday League (whose fixtures are perversely on weekday evenings) should remain a man's game. Asked if his tirade to the ref was a manifesto for equal rights, he said: \"My sister's a lesbian so there was nothing meant by it.\" YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH US The police have been busy in the north this week, with Cumbrian bobbies shooting a bull which escaped in a Morrison's car park, threatening the 4X4 housewives' jeeps of Carlisle as surely as the traditional crockery in a china shop. While the News and Star carries that tale, the Lancashire Evening Telegraph has an long denunciation of Prime Suspect, the latest TV offering from the excellent Helen Mirren, which apparently got it all wrong about Crimestoppers. In an interesting example of how local detail compares with national generalities, the paper explains how an episode where police record and trace an anonymous tip-off was contrary to the whole point about Crimestoppers - its absolute confidentiality. Detective Andy Edwards tells the Telegraph: \"TV has a massive impact on people's lives - we will have to see if this has a negative effect on our Crimestopper work when we look at the figures at the end of the month.\" The Telegraph will no doubt cover that too. Meanwhile the Manchester Evening News couples a splash attacking the city council's \"damningly high\" crime figures, with giving the top spot in its 'Hot Jobs' column to this: \"Train to be a Police Officer in Manchester. Starting Salary GBP19,227. Variety and challenge. The only predictability about being a police officer is unpredictability.\" You can say that again, after revelations in that other recent brush between police and TV, the undercover revelations of racist recruits at a training centre near Manchester. But this isn't actually the week's hottest northern vacancy. That's reserved for a brave clergyman, as the Westmoreland Gazette reports. The Church of England is advertising for someone to take over Crosscrake and Preston parish, whose sacked incumbent Harry Brown famously filled the papers earlier this year at his failed appeal against charges of bullying and sexual harrassment, including French-kissing the head of the Cumbrian tourist board. HORSES' PREFERRED COURSES Sporting news now, from the equestrian section of the Yorkshire Post. If you want to get your grumpy point-to-pointer safely into a trailer, settle down and paint the ramp green. This tip comes from student Hannah Haskew (an interesting surname, probably evidence that the Unnecessary Yorkshire Haitch has been around for a long time). Hannah has won GBP500 from the Royal Agriculture Society of England for a thesis which tested horses on trailer ramps painted black (by far the most common colour), red, grey and green. She found that the animals liked them in the reverse order, with green much the least troublesome, no doubt because of its vague resemblance to fields and grass. Hannah's breakthrough is unlikely to go further, however, according to the Post - at least not in Yorkshire where horse-owners are too thrifty to mess around changing the colour of trailer-ramps. \"Bet we don't take it up,\" says the paper, \"because most horses will tackle black, even if they have to be told: 'Get on, you so-and-so.' NO TICKET TO RIDE Finally, a little sandwich-bite of popular culture now, and a heart-warming one for old veterans of the 1960s like myself. Browsing the Beatles' web pages of the Liverpool Echo is like having a warm, nostalgic bath. The electronic air is even redolent of all those very relaxed Debates about Everything we had in flower-power days. For example, the Echo's poll on the absorbing question: \"Should the Eleanor Rigby statue to moved to a more prominent position in Liverpool?' is almost exactly, comfortingly divided: Yes 49.36%, No: 50.64%. There's a paradigm of a good rambling topic for debate after which nothing need be done. But we weren't entirely passive in those sunny days, as a different Echo, the one in Sunderland, reports. Its columnist John Wearmouth is looking for Carol Dryden, a local girl who was 12 at the height of Beatlemania and posted herself to the group in a tea chest, snugly lined with blankets and equipped with a flask for the trip. Postal problems were not unknown then, as now, and she unfortunately ended up in a depot at Crewe where her taps - the flask being empty and the blankets manky - got her let out. Where is she now, asks John Wearmouth, an appeal which the Northerner happily amplifies. If she still has her tea chest, the Beatles museum in Liverpool will surely feature it in the coming European Capital of Culture festivities. DAVID WARD RECOMMENDS... \"The Royal Shakespeare Company has linked with Live Theatre in Newcastle to promote new writing in the north-east. \"One of the first fruits of the partnership is Keepers Of The Flame by Sean O'Brien, which has been warmly welcomed on the banks of the Tyne. It plays with the idea of a poet in the thirties who turns right instead of left and lends his skills to the burgeoning fascist movement. \"This is verse drama, which was thought to have gone out of fashion when the wheel fell of Christopher Fry's cart and Eliot's furies retreated behind the net curtains. The Guardian thought it was pretty good and the FT loved it: \"O'Brien's confident and established voice as a poet has now fully meshed with his growing sensibilities as a playwright. I cannot think of a play for some decades that works this well both as verse and as theatre.\" \"The play stars Alan Howard, who some of us remember in his glory days at the RSC and who is now making a welcome return to the stage. Book now: performances are selling out.\" Live Theatre NORTHERN NEWSPAPERS This is Lancashire This is Hull News and Star (Cumbria) Liverpool Echo Newcastle Evening Chronicle This is the North East Yorkshire Post Sunderland Echo Manchester Online This is Bradford North West Evening Mail Sheffield Today icTeesside Halifax Evening Courier Huddersfield Examiner Scarborough Evening News Oldham Evening Chronicle * Martin Wainwright explains: \"I think an argosy is a sort of grand vessel laden with good things but you could substitute chariot or charabanc, maybe.\" The Collins English dictionary says: \"A large abundantly laden merchant ship, or a fleet of such ships.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
