The ruling yesterday by a European court, while seemingly a pyrrhic victory, was welcomed by MCI, which was known as WorldCom until the business emerged from bankruptcy protection in April. MCI believes the ruling against the European commission will remove a dangerous precedent and that future deals in the technology sector will receive a fairer review. Stasia Kelly, MCI's general counsel, said: \"Four years ago, we argued that the global internet environment was rapidly changing and that no competitor could exercise sole market power. Time has proved those arguments true. \"While the companies elected to pursue separate strategies after the European commission's initial reaction in 2000, we believed a decision that so misperceived the highly competitive nature of the internet marketplace should not be allowed to affect future transactions in this highly dynamic industry.\" The European commission, which was ordered to pay MCI's costs by the European court of first instance, is considering appealing against the decision. A spokeswoman said the ruling could increase regulatory uncertainty, \"if from now on companies automatically withdraw their cases before a decision is taken\". She added: \"I don't think it's in the interests of the market.\" The case is the latest in a line of setbacks for the European commission. The court in Luxembourg has kicked out previous commission decisions banning the merger of the travel operator Airtours with First Choice, and the Swedish milk carton maker Tetra Laval's acquisition of its French rival Sidel. The WorldCom acquisition of Sprint was also blocked by the US justice department, which voiced concern about the strength of the merged business in the global market for internet connectivity. WorldCom collapsed later amid allegations of an $11bn (\u00a36bn) corporate fraud. The business became the world's largest corporate casualty and was forced to seek Chapter 11 protection from its creditors. Its former boss Bernie Ebbers has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud and is expected to stand trial in November. Separately, MCI is suing him for $300m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
