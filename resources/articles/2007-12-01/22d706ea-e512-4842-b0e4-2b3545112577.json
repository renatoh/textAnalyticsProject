Wood from the sea, impregnated with salt, burns well, being generally seasoned timber from old craft, and often covered with dried tar. An expedition to our coast during winter months - when strong winds and big seas can throw kindling and the dog enjoys a roll in the sand - is one of my favourite ways of spending a morning, well wrapped up against the wind. Alder, willow and birch wood are all worth collecting, but they do burn away quickly and so need constant replenishment. Elm must be well weathered and dry, or it will refuse to burn, and beech and larch are really only suitable for laying the fire as they are often rather twiggy in texture. Oak is the longest lasting and the one which gives out the most heat, and ash also makes a good blaze. However, wood from conifers should be avoided because it crackles and spits on an open fire. When he was a child, one of our sons loved collecting wood with me and took an old hemp bag on our walks and filled it with fir cones which make good firelighters. Sea coal, which was exposed from old coal layers on the sea's bottom, is now extremely rare, but it tends to be clean and smooth to handle as it has no soot in it, and it also burns slowly. However, it does often leave a white deposit in the hearth which must be removed before a new fire is laid for the next day. Ponies used for pulling flat carts to collect sea coal from our coast used to be tethered in the dunes and on village greens in the neighbourhood of Newbiggin and Cresswell, but now they are no longer used. The few men who still glean fuel use mechanical vehicles. Regular immersion in salt water, which the ponies' work entailed, was beneficial to their limbs and hooves, and the animals were generally well cared for. I will never forget on one cold winter day watching a pony turn and swim strongly out to sea, taking his flat cart with him. The poor coalie man watched helplessly as his livelihood looked in imminent danger of drowning in the freezing waves. Rescue teams were alerted but, before they arrived, the pony fortunately revised his sense of direction, and, after swimming in a wide arc, headed back towards the shore. It was a mercy that the cart did not become waterlogged and drag the pony down with it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
