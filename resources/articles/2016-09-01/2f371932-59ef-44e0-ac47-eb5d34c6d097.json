The former is a recently confected \u2013 pun required by law \u2013 communal obsession, more imagined nostalgia for cosy postwar domesticity than actual taste. The latter is a cultural conduit through which a population not known for its ability to let it all hang out, emotions-wise, can express its fury, resentment, jealousy and hopelessness. But in a week in which frequent offenders Joey Barton and Brad Pitt have had their mugs all over the newspapers, it\u2019s absurdly twinkly-eyed baker Paul Hollywood who has really taken the \u2013 second contractual pun \u2013 biscuit. For those who have been living in a hole for the past week, or perhaps engaged in gainful or valuable employment, Hollywood is currently the only member of the Great British Bake Off\u2019s presenter team to follow the programme from BBC1 to Channel 4. Mel and Sue were quickest out of the blocks to tell Love Productions where to shove it, thereby obliterating the memory of countless lame jokes and loud blazers to shoot straight to No 1 in the national treasure chart, and were only knocked off when Mary Berry followed suit. Hollywood\u2019s failure to swell the picket line has had immense and instant repercussions. Unsurprisingly, reporters flocked to his house, whereupon he tweeted a picture of himself outside Berlin airport, with the words: \u201cSee you over here soon?\u201d Pretty chipper behaviour from a man who had just been on the receiving end of some choice comments from former contestant Ruby Tandoh, who called him \u2013 also on Twitter \u2013 a \u201cpeacocking manchild lingering wherever the money is\u201d, recalled him turning up to work revving a rental Lamborghini (possibly, she corrected herself, a Ferrari) and poked fun at his spray tan and boot-cut jeans. These, of course, are fairly common or garden signifiers of a distaste for middle-aged men and their middle-aged crises, but worse was to come. \u201cWe locked battle with a mythic beast,\u201d wrote Tandoh, now in full Sylvia Plath mode, \u201cboth bright white and mahogany, man and baby, ego and terrible, terrible fragility all at once.\u201d Harsh. But what, really, has Hollywood done? Set fire to the big tent and all the weird pastel furniture therein? Stuck a \u201ckick me\u201d sign on one of Mary\u2019s vivid bomber jackets? (Well, pretty much; he failed to thank her in one of his statements, thereby incensing Bake Off fans staring into the terrifying abyss of having nothing to be angry about.) Essentially, not much: just gone along with a new business model for an entertainment product that might very well have needed one. That\u2019s one way of looking at the duck-rabbit that is Great British Bake Off. The other is that he stared a fragile populace directly in its tear-filled eyes, grabbed the only thing standing between them and a full-blown national nervous breakdown and ground it beneath his hand-tooled cuban heel. For a quid. And then cackled. Another school of thought is that Hollywood, the baker\u2019s son who kneaded his way through kitchens from the Dorchester to Egypt before setting up his own business and beginning to develop a media career, was always going to be the overfilled souffle that brought on an attack of dyspepsia. And, as with many annoying ailments, it began with an unrestrained appetite, not merely Hollywood\u2019s but also the programme makers\u2019. Bake Off\u2019s charm has always lain in its refusal to conform to the rampant back-story prurience of other reality television shows, the high-definition equivalent of curtain-twitching combined with a vapid belief in personal journeys. The brief clips of bakers\u2019 home lives that punctuate GBBO are more likely to picture them dishing up a shepherd\u2019s pie on a Tuesday night than weeping into the arms of the brother they never knew they had. And attempts to foster rivalry \u2013 the whipped-up scandal that ensued when Iain Watters threw his baked alaska into the bin \u2013 have always met with limited success; the competitors can\u2019t seem to help themselves nipping over to someone else\u2019s bench to offer advice and moral support when the sugar hit the fan. But there is always sex. Sex always sells and sex always brings trouble in its wake, especially once you hit 50, as Hollywood did early this year. For the midlifers on telly, there are scant choices: you either float above it or get down and dirty with it. The executives \u2013 and possibly Hollywood was a willing victim \u2013 decided that the bread-maker was their likeliest option for the second course of action. Thus: the eyes got bluer, the hair got spikier, the jeans got tighter. Shirt unbuttoned, legs planted firmly apart, thumbs in belt loops, Hollywood issued his instructions for all manner of buns, brioches and bagels; it was the thigh watermark of that contemporary feminist b\u00eate noire, manspreading. And then there was the flirting. You could circle the globe with a list of Mel and Sue\u2019s double entendres and even Mary is occasionally allowed to veer slightly towards the cheeky. Paul, on the other hand, does not feel the need to limit himself to juvenile soggy bottom jokes. Verbal sparring is of no great interest to him. His preferred methods of communication are fairly simple: he mildly intimidates contestants he\u2019s not much impressed by and butters up the ones he likes. And if they happen to be an attractive, youngish woman, all to the good. (This might, incidentally, explain some of the history between Hollywood and Tandoh: when Tandoh came out in 2015, she delighted in pointing out that misogynists who had accused her of flirting with Hollywood on the show to better her chances of winning had been barking up the wrong tree. He subsequently sent her his congratulations, but questioned why she had involved him in her announcement.) Such developments introduced an unstable element to the mixture; its thorough benignity began, perhaps, to look like something a little brasher. And neither is it irrelevant to acknowledge a class element here: a cocky Merseysider can easily be manoeuvred into looking like a bit of rough with soft hands, but it\u2019s virtually impossible for him to acquire the home counties solidity of an elderly woman in pink lipstick and pearls. A marriage breakdown, in part precipitated by Hollywood\u2019s relationship with his co-presenter on a failed American version of the show, does not help, even after a public reconciliation. Whether Hollywood can weather the storm \u2013 whether GBBO itself can \u2013 is a moot point and one certainly suspects that there are a few more turns of the wheel to come. But his part in the affair is revealing. Had it played out differently \u2013 had Berry decided to continue onwards to a bright future on Channel 4, or even the whole lot of them \u2013 one wonders whether they would have drawn such opprobrium. The collective rage and anguish over Bake Off\u2019s travails is not about its frontman and women \u2013 it\u2019s about our confused and fluctuating attitude towards the BBC and a peculiarly entitled sense of ownership of ephemeral artefacts that we believe, mistakenly or not, reflect and reinforce our cultural identity. The Beeb was damned if it did and damned if it didn\u2019t; Channel 4, which points out that had it not intervened, Bake Off might not have remained on terrestrial television at all, could also claim similar. At home, viewers punch- drunk on Netflix binges and primed to boxset their way through the winter, know in their hearts that they are not helping and are also wistful for the semi-remembered days of so-called watercooler television. Bake Off doesn\u2019t dismember women, it doesn\u2019t bring us incestuous cavorting on the back of a dragon, it doesn\u2019t cook meth. It doesn\u2019t take us out of the European Union or elect an orange-haired maniac. It doesn\u2019t fell our heroes or make our football team pants. But, in all fairness, neither does Paul Hollywood. Give the fella a break. Born 1966, on the Wirral, Merseyside. His father, who owned a bakery business, left when he was 10. He studied sculpture at the Wallasey School of Art but quit to work in his father\u2019s bakery. He later became head baker at hotels including the Dorchester and Cliveden. Best of times More than 10 million viewers tuned in to watch the first episode of Bake Off when it returned for a seventh series this summer. Worst of times The announcement that co-stars Mary Berry, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins quit Bake Off after it was poached by Channel 4. What he says \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t work, but it does, because of the different cogs. Take one cog out and it won\u2019t work. Its beauty is its nostalgia. You\u2019re looking back on something your parents or grandparents baked when you were a kid.\u201d What others say \u201cHe is difficult\u2026 But we respect each other. I would never argue with him over a loaf of something because he knows the science of it, how they\u2019ve achieved it and everything.\u201d Mary Berry"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
