The Holland international had been widely expected to leave Villa Park as a free agent and was linked with several Premier League clubs including Manchester United and Southampton. However, having recovered from several injury setbacks to play a commanding role in Villa\u2019s progression to the FA Cup final, and witnessed a change around the club since Sherwood replaced Paul Lambert as manager in February, he admits he could be persuaded to stay. Following a dominant display in Villa\u2019s semi-final victory over Liverpool at Wembley, the 30-year-old said: \u201cYes it is possible [I could stay]. Things have changed for me in the past few months since Sherwood took over. It\u2019s been a hard season for me with all the injuries. Now I just want to play and be important for the team. This helps \u2013 you can trust me on that. \u201cI don\u2019t know about my future but to be part of this feels so good. To feel the joy and relief after the West Brom game when so many people came on the pitch. The impact for the fans, how big it is for this club and what it all means. I called my dad and said \u2019This really means something!\u2019 It\u2019s great. Everything helps.\u201d The final against Arsenal on 30 May could be Vlaar\u2019s last game for Villa but the defender insists he is open-minded about his future. He added: \u201c Maybe it will be my last game but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to say. I want to win it anyway, no matter what, for the team, for the club, for the fans and for myself. Then we will see what happens. It\u2019s not something to think about right now. This feels really great and I also feel things have changed at the club. You never know. I can\u2019t tell anyone too much about it right now.\u201d Sherwood\u2019s team still have to secure their Premier League status with Villa only four points clear of the relegation zone with five matches remaining, but Vlaar believes confidence will soar after the Liverpool result. He said: \u201cThings change in football. It wasn\u2019t so good earlier in the year but that\u2019s football. It\u2019s crazy but it\u2019s also a fact. The new manager came in and we all felt it was a new start. It\u2019s never good when someone has to go but it felt like a fresh start. We started to play better, the results got better and the only thing that gives you confidence is winning games so this win will give us another massive boost. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go again and focus on the league. The way the fans have been has really helped. We\u2019ve already had some great games in the cup. You could see the relief after the whistle against West Brom and let\u2019s hope there\u2019s another one to come. We have to believe we can win it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
