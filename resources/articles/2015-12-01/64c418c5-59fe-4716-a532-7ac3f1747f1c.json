The Dutchman entered the game with his future as manager in serious doubt as United looked to avoid losing a fifth match in a row for the first time in 79 years. Yet despite the result being a seventh goalless draw and the sixth at United\u2019s stadium this season, Van Gaal was heartened by the way his players responded. Following Saturday\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Stoke City Van Gaal mentioned he could resign. However, the manager claimed his comments had been reported out of context. Van Gaal said: \u201cI think I didn\u2019t say that. I have said that a club can sack you but that a manager can also resign by himself. When a colleague of you then writes it in another context, no, I have given you in a press conference a [comment] that it is not only part of the decision, also the manager can take that decision. \u201cI have said also in all my press conferences, they are asking all the time: \u2018Are you concerned that maybe they sack you?\u2019 Of course I am concerned but I am more concerned to prepare my players. \u201cThen I read things in the press. They are lies, not based on facts. They are the reasons I walk away in a press conference and not angrily. No, I walk with quietness because I want to make my point. \u201cFor me, it [his future] is not an interesting subject because I cannot have any influence on that, I can only work with my players and you can see they are fighting for me. Even after this result the fans were applauding so I cannot say I\u2019m very much concerned. In this football world you never know but I\u2019m fully confident in the board and my players. \u201cWill I resign? On the contrary. When the players can give such a performance with a lot of pressure, there is not any reason to resign for me. Maybe the media wants me to but I shall not resign. It\u2019s not a question of staying. It\u2019s a question of fulfilling my contract.\u201d Van Gaal resisted the notion of there being a crisis at the club and it now being over. \u201cI don\u2019t know because the crisis is more or less the environment is making the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cInside the club the players are willing to fight for every metre, the manager is willing to fight, the members of staff are willing to fight and the board is very confident in the staff and the manager so it is not inside Manchester United.\u201d However, when it was put to Van Gaal that four consecutive defeats at a club the stature of United might constitute a crisis, he said: \u201cYes, but also for me and also for the players. Maybe you can investigate in my career how many times I lost four matches in a row. I cannot remember but maybe I put it away because it is a dark period.\u201d Van Gaal indicated he is continuing to plan to try and strengthen in the January transfer window. \u201cOf course, it is not only the last days but also before but that is the consequence. I have said to Dutch TV that Manchester United has a lot of confidence in his manager and I have received that not in every club,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, of course, I know that there are circumstances that the board has to decide to sack the manager and I am looking always from my point of view and that can be not the right view and in this crazy football world that can happen every day, also with me. When it happens to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, then it can happen with me.\u201d Guus Hiddink, the new Chelsea interim manager, said he was pleased with a point from his side after being forced to field Eden Hazard as an auxiliary forward. \u201cEveryone knows we have some problems in our striker\u2019s position due to suspension and injuries and we had to think how to solve that. We did it with Hazard. \u201cThe players have experienced a very bad half year. They have to lift it up and that\u2019s what we have talked about in the locker room. \u201cEveryone is convinced we couldn\u2019t go on the same path and we have shown that in the last three games,\u201d Hiddink said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
