The young jockey from Cheltenham positioned himself some weeks ago in Australia, where racing continues behind closed doors, and will have five rides on a very valuable card at Randwick on Saturday. Marquand isn\u2019t just taking the riding fees and counting himself lucky to have work. He has racked up 25 winners in the New South Wales area this season, including some significant prizes, and has been gathering admirers. One local headline referred to him as \u201cTerrific Tom\u201d, while another, over an article about his effective whip use, cried: \u201cMarquand waves his magic wand and has everyone under his spell again\u201d. \u201cObviously it\u2019s been a pretty good trip,\u201d the jockey tells me over the phone, \u201cbut more just complete luck as to timing, with everything that\u2019s going on. But it\u2019s pretty bad circumstances for it all to be under. \u201cFrom last year, all of the trainers in Sydney have stuck me up on one or two, here or there, and there\u2019ve been particular stables that have really picked me up and helped me, like Ciaron Maher and David Eustace, John O\u2019Shea and David Hayes.\u201d But it was an English-trained horse that provided Marquand with the highlight of his trip so far, indeed of his career, when William Haggas\u2019s Addeybb won the Ranvet last month. That was a first Group One success for Marquand, who had never ridden the horse before and showed his pace judgement by making almost all the running. Haggas has since described the jockey as \u201ca future champion\u201d. Marquand and Addeybb will reunite on Saturday for the Queen Elizabeth Stakes, another Group One, and the bookies make them 7-2 third-favourites. Marquand has an even better chance on Haggas\u2019s Young Rascal in the Sydney Cup, worth over \u00a3300,000 to the winner, for which they head the betting at 11-8. While his British colleagues are doing their best to keep fit at home, Marquand has managed six Group Three wins and a Listed success in the past couple of months, during which time his mounts have racked up \u00a31.5m in prize money. But how long can it last, with the coronavirus necessitating restrictions everywhere? \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve thought, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll probably struggle to get past this weekend,\u2019 they seem to pull it out the bag and carry on racing for another week, and then another. So I don\u2019t quite know where it is and I don\u2019t think anyone does. \u201cWe\u2019re on a lockdown here now. We\u2019ve still got the racing but you\u2019re virtually still in isolation, even when you\u2019re going to the races because they put you in separate jockeys\u2019 rooms and you have to stand the other side of a fence, two metres away from trainers to get instructions. You\u2019re not coming into contact with anyone.\u201d When Marquand had his 22nd birthday last week, it was, perforce, a \u201cvery quiet\u201d occasion. It has not been much noisier at the track, with no spectators present. \u201cYou have to remind yourself of the significance of the day,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would easily go unnoticed, the magnitude of the meeting. One Saturday recently, it was a nine-race card, eight of them were Group races and two Group Ones. But it was the same atmosphere of being at Kempton on a rainy Wednesday evening. That\u2019s the reality of it. But as a jockey, you\u2019re trying to win just as much. No one\u2019s forgetting what these races mean to all of us within the industry.\u201d Travel plans are hard to form just now but Marquand\u2019s hope is to return to Britain after a couple more weekends of racing in Australia. How soon British racing can hope to get going again is a completely open question. But when it does, Marquand is sure to be one of the most in-demand riders, the more so for enjoying such success while his rivals have been becalmed. Who does he expect to ride for in Britain this year? \u201cObviously the relationship with William Haggas has been successful. But I was brought into it with Richard Hannon and I still spend a lot of time there when I am around. I\u2019d love to be riding as much as I can for them and William, and many different people. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky in the fact that I\u2019ve got yards like Tony Carroll, Ali and Sam Stronge and Tom Ward that\u2019ll stick me on a lot of their horses. I\u2019m lucky to have a very wide base of trainers that use me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
