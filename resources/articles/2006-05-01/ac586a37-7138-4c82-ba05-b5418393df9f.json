In Australia, this is a sombre day, a traditional public holiday, when families remember their mates and loved ones who were killed fighting for their country. Now, it will also be the day when Beaconsfield, Tasmania remembers its son, Larry Knight, who was killed while doing his job. On that night, a small earthquake had triggered a rockfall at the Beaconsfield gold mine, 3,000ft underground. Seventeen miners had started their 12-hour shift at 6pm. When the mine collapsed just after 9.30pm, 14 miners managed to escape, leaving three men unaccounted for. After two days of searching, Knight's body was uncovered in the rubble. The two others, Brant Webb and Todd Russell, were still missing, feared dead. Local news is often only important to those it affects. But a curious conjunction of circumstances made this mining accident world news. The national media were arriving in Tasmania to cover the 10th anniversary commemoration for 35 people who had been killed by a lone gunman in Port Arthur; now, instead, they were diverted to the Beaconsfield mine. National representatives of the Australian Workers Union were next to arrive and immediately raised the temperature - \"This was an accident that should never have happened,\" they declared. Tasmania is itself a small, safe, island community. Its capital city, Hobart, has a population of less than 200,000. As a place to live, its proportions are human in every way. So it is not an overstatement to say that these small-town tragedies touched everyone at least slightly. When Tasmanians first heard, live on Sunday night's ABC TV News, that Brant Webb and Todd Russell had been found alive, 13 days after their ordeal began, newsreader Rachel Fisher could hardly contain her joy: this was the good news the emotionally battered state needed. People texted and phoned one another to share it. And with this news, the story really caught fire. Soon a media-populated campervan city had formed, housing about 200 journalists, sustained by the town's small businesses as well as home-cooked casseroles and soups provided by local families. \"We never asked for it,\" commented one Sydney reporter, amazed at what comes naturally to most Tasmanians. In another twist of fate, Australia's veteran John Simpson-style journalist, Richard Carleton of Sixty Minutes, died of a massive heart attack, just minutes after asking a question during one of the daily mine press conferences. Now townspeople joined journalists in mourning their loss. The tone was set for the Beaconsfield coverage: endless live updates from emotionally attached and personally involved journalists, living the story. With few pictures to show, the cameras turned to the trade unionists - naturally articulate, appropriately rugged-looking men - who fell into the role of narrating events. \"It's about mates sticking together,\" said Paul Howes, vice-president of the Australian Workers Union, confiding to a local radio presenter that, these days, his job was more about deciphering the technicalities of the Australian government's new industrial relations laws than about the workers. Now, Howes confessed, he had rediscovered his reason for becoming a unionist. \"These are hard rock miners who do this for a living, rescuing their mates,\" said union boss Bill Shorten. The clarity of the union's running commentary was too pure and spontaneous to be spun, and provided the story's narrative. Underlying this, however, was a political argument about the right of skilled workers to be allowed to come together to make workplace agreements - a right recently sidelined by prime minister John Howard. It was not surprising, on the day of both freedom and funeral, that Howard invited the miners and their rescuers to a reception at Parliament House, Canberra, in three weeks' time. Nor is it surprising that Shorten is being spoken of as a future Labor prime minister. Politics aside, the Beaconsfield mine story made its mark on popular culture. When one of the men requested music by the Foo Fighters while waiting to be rescued, ABC Radio contacted lead singer Dave Grohl to send a message to the miners to lift their spirits. Grohl obliged with a fax that made it down the pipeline to the trapped men, offering them \"two tickets to any Foo's show anywhere, and two cold beers\". The normally middle-of-the-road ABC Radio broke its playlist to play the indie-rock Foos. And when Shorten described the men's rescue as \"The Great Escape from the biggest prison we've got\", news programmes dug into their archives to underscore his words with the movie tune. All the while, the rescue operation countdown of \"another 48 hours\" with the clock ticking, made the saturation coverage of the drama feel like an episode of the television series 24. And then, of course, there's the romance of working-class heroes: those burly men, blessed with physical good looks and generous of humour, ripping off their tags from the safety board that showed them to be still below ground, and wrapping their John Wayne hulks around their wives - safe home from the mine and ready for a home-cooked meal. As the pre-dawn news spread through the town that the trapped miners were coming out, the bell of Beaconsfield's Uniting Church rang. It had not rung since welcoming home soldiers from the second world war. \"Is that them?\" asked the national breakfast television host David Koch. After only being able to imagine what they would look like after their ordeal, the media almost mistook the high-visibility jackets and beards of Webb and Russell for those of their rescuers. As they were driven away in ambulances for a hospital check-up, family and friends lined the street to cheer them. On the same day, in a melancholy echo of that procession, a cortege of Harley-Davidsons and motorcycle friends from the Christian Motorcycle God Squad escorted Larry Knight's body to the cemetery. Mining remains a hazardous job. According to Tony Maher, the national president of the miners' union, there have been 3,000 men killed in mining accidents in Australia's history (admittedly, a figure dwarfed by the more than 5,000 deaths reported every year in Chinese mines - but not reported like Beaconsfield's). The mine in \"Beacy\" is a small operation, employing just 300 men. It had closed in 1914, after the original gold rush in Tasmania, but was redeveloped in the 1980s as the price of gold made it economic to work the mine again. Thanks to the fast-growing economies of China and India, a commodity markets banker based in Asia explains, the price of gold is at a 25-year high, almost doubling in the past two years to the current price of $680 (\u00a3365) per ounce. But is it worth all the lives lost in extracting it? \"Gold mining is a completely pointless exercise,\" he says. \"People dig it, refine it and bury it in another hole in the ground. It is never consumed, you can never destroy it - all the gold that's ever been mined still exists. And it's very energy-intensive - the yield is seven grammes per tonne. A lot of effort goes into it just so that it can be buried again.\" But, for once, effort was rewarded: the effort of the rescuers at least. \"Today is pay day,\" said one. \"The boys are out and they're with their families.\" When Koch jumped into the ambulance with Russell, the miner gave Koch his safety badge. Interviewed by his own network about the gesture, Koch said this was \"the nicest thing anyone has ever given me\". And perhaps what made this story was how the spirit of small-town solidarity went far and wide, touching people who did not even expect to feel it. Koch paid tribute to \"the amazing spirit we see time and again in our regional communities\". \"If we could just bottle that up and take it back with us to the city,\" he commented, \"we'd be a lot better off, wouldn't we?\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
