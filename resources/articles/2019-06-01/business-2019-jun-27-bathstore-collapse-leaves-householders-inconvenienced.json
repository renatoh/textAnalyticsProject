Bathstore\u2019s administrators, the accountants BDO, wrote to all the firm\u2019s subcontracted plumbers on Wednesday night terminating them \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. Faced with not being paid the plumbers have in turn all downed tools \u2013 whether the household had a functioning loo, or not. Customers waiting for a new bathroom to be delivered may also lose the money paid to the company. Bathstore, the UK\u2019s biggest bathroom specialist, collapsed into administration on Wednesday after BDO failed to find a buyer for the loss-making business. More than 500 jobs look set to be lost at its 132 stores. On Thursday, 89 people were laid off at Bathstore\u2019s head office in Welwyn Garden City. Bathstore is just the latest high street retailer to collapse, and it will not be the last, retail experts have warned. The chain\u2019s demise has also left a trail of unhappy customers, some of whom could be left with no working toilet because the old one had been removed before the new one was installed. Some of those affected face the prospect of spending several weeks without a working bathroom as they are forced to hunt around for alternative installers. Anne Maskell, who lives in King\u2019s Sutton, near Banbury, was left with an empty bathroom, and no upstairs toilet. Back in April she paid Bathstore \u00a36,000 for a new suite with installation included. \u201cMy installer had completely gutted my bathroom and was about to put in the new one. I am relatively lucky in that most of the new one had been delivered \u2013 minus some tiles, which we have been able to source independently,\u201d Maskell said. \u201cLast night, my installer was told by the administrator that his contract was terminated immediately, and therefore he couldn\u2019t do the work. I am by no means alone. I understand there are lot of people with unfinished bathrooms out there.\u201d She said she was lucky in that she had paid for the work by credit card, meaning she can hold Barclaycard liable for the work. She said she has now agreed to pay the original fitter to complete the work, in the expectation the credit card firm will refund her. Other Bathstore customers have not fared so well, posting photos of bare walls and spaces in their bathrooms on social media. It is not clear if they will receive the toilets and other items ordered. Ryan Grant, the joint administrator, said on Wednesday that Bathstore should be able to fulfil the majority of outstanding customer orders. However, customers have now been sent an email telling them to contact their card providers to ask for a chargeback or refund. Bathstore had subcontracted out all its installation work to an army of small businesses. Many of them will have lost hundreds, if not thousands of pounds in unpaid invoices. They have been told by the company that they are unsecured creditors. Consumer experts said the case shows the importance of using a credit card when making big ticket purchases that are due to be delivered some time after payment, as consumers are protected on purchases over \u00a3100."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
