Ferguson was surprised by the severity of the punishment and his employers will hope their \"disappointment\" is not so extreme in the next few days when the Football Association announces the charges Rio Ferdinand is to face. United's legal team went straight from Ferguson's disciplinary hearing in Manchester city centre into talks at Old Trafford about Ferdinand's now infamous failure to take a drugs test at the club's training ground a month ago. Aware that the FA is becoming increasingly impatient with the length of time it was taking to receive relevant documents such as Ferdinand's mobile telephone records, the club said a dossier was on its way to the ruling's body headquarters in London last night. It includes a statement from the club's doctor Mike Stone detailing how Ferdinand had apparently left the training ground unnoticed, and the latest bill for his mobile telephone, which corroborates his story that he contacted the FA after realising he had forgotten to meet the drug-testers. The FA has also received a signed affidavit from Manchester City's Eyal Berkovic, who, as a friend of Ferdinand from their West Ham days, had been with him on the relevant afternoon and will support his claims that he wanted to reorganise the test for the same day. Steve Barrow, the FA's compliance officer who is leading the investigation, is also inquiring into why Ferdinand, before calling the FA, apparently spoke to Patrick O 'Reilly, a consultant urologist at the private clinic in Cheshire where the England defender was treated last month for what was described as a kidney complaint. United expect that Ferdinand will face a charge of failing to take a drugs test rather than the more serious offence of wilfully missing a test. Nevertheless, it still carries the threat of a lengthy suspension. United will also go to the high court this week to try to prevent their former security official Ned Kelly releasing a book about his time at Old Trafford and, specifically, the players' nocturnal habits. Ferguson is considering appealing against the FA's decision. Otherwise he will have to watch United's next two games, at home to Fulham on Saturday and the Carling Cup tie at Leeds a week tonight, from the directors' seats. Clearly angry, the manager left the four-hour hearing complaining that the FA had not taken into account his previously unblemished disciplinary record, having never faced a misconduct charge during his 17 years at Old Trafford. When Maurice Watkins, the club's solicitor, emerged to tell reporters he believed the FA had considered Ferguson's record, the manager butted in: \"Did they? Are you sure?\" Watkins said: \"Well, they said they did, anyway.\" Ferguson had submitted a detailed account to the hearing denying that he had called the referee Uriah Rennie a \"cheat\" for having failed to penalise Newcastle's Andy O'Brien for a foul on Ryan Giggs, but admitting that he swore at the fourth official Jeff Winter. The two officials also gave their version of events, and Rennie is understood to have accepted that he missed a crucial decision. Mike Phelan, United's assistant manager, gave evidence on behalf of Ferguson. Rennie's refereeing was severely criticised. United believe the FA did not want to face accusations of double standards after suspending Portsmouth's manager Harry Redknapp for two matches for a similar offence in a game at Wolves last month. \"I'm sure those kind of things are considered by a tribunal,\" said Watkins. \"It 's fair to say we are disappointed with the decision, especially when you consider Alex's previous record. We will consider an appeal but it is better to take our time on a decision like that rather than making a snap decision. \"It was a fair hearing, there was no aggravation, but there was a difference in our view with the evidence [of the match officials ].\" Of Ferdinand, Watkins said he \"would hope\" the FA would announce the charges by the end of the week. \"All our information has gone to the FA,\" he said, \"and it 's up to them then to review the situation and decide what to do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
