Yet I can't help feeling my friend is overlooking other vital roles on the field of play to which encroaching middle-age provides less of a barrier than Matthew Upson did to Miroslav Klose. Even within the designated position of chief arguer there are many variants to be explored, from the full Roy-Keane-Is-Max-Schrek vein-bulging stormtrooper, to the Arjen Robben \"Mam! Mam! That big boy stole my lollipop\" whinge-merchant, via the subtle approach of the more cynical veteran who questions every decision with a quizzically raised eyebrow, an amused half-grin and a general air of a 19th century prince explaining to one of his aristocratic chums that he is planning to cuckold him, but, \"We're both men of the world, so we really oughtn't to make a terrible fuss about these things, ought we, old chap?\" It was clear in South Africa, for instance, that Mark van Bommel is the Edward VII of modern football. Sadly, such important aspects of our national hobby pass largely unacknowledged by media pundits and I have yet to hear Mark Bright telling BBC Radio 5 Live listeners, \"You know, his game used to be all about swearing and collateral spittle, but since he turned 30 he's started to get into those little pockets of irony just behind the debate that officials find very difficult to pick up on.\" And don't think I haven't texted in on the topic either. Bickering is one skill that cleaves itself to a man as tenaciously as Claudio Gentile to Diego Maradona's jersey. Another is pointing. Pointing is a subtle art that over the years has been brilliantly demonstrated by some of the world's greatest exponents of his-legs-have-gone-but-he's-still-got-that-something-about-him football. Johnny Haynes, late-era Johan Cruyff and Brazil's chain-smoking Socrates were all three acknowledged masters of the levelled index finger, while arguably the greatest of them all, Alfredo di St\u00e9fano made himself a hero to menopausal blokes everywhere by losing his hair, developing a comfort-fit waistline and still dominating European football via his superb mastery of digital directives. It is clear, therefore, that the role of central positional indicator (CPI) is one that is aptly suited to the footballer who, like my friend, is swaying on the cusp of his sixth decade. The central positional indicator's task is \u2013 like Haynes, Cruyff, Socrates and \"The Divine Bald One\" \u2013 to take root in the centre circle and spend the entire match pointing to where all his team-mates should be standing at that moment. Occasionally he will draw on a deep knowledge of the game acquired over 40 years of telling anyone who will listen that he once \"nearly had a trial with Villa, but I was into girls and music and couldn't be bothered\" to utter simple yet profound advice to his colleagues such as \"Keep knocking the inside funnels lads\", \"Let's not go spongy in the defensive 25%, boys\" or the inspirational, \"Areas! Areas!\" At other times the CPI may actually feel moved to touch the ball, collecting it, looking up and off towards destiny, before passing it two yards sideways, after which he will then point to where the player who just received the ball should give it next. When the CPI's instruction is ignored and the move breaks down he can then engage in what is in many ways the quintessence of his trade, standing with his hands on his hips in momentary exasperation before holding a finger up to his right eye and saying, \"Vision, son. Vision.\" I should say that I am not speaking from personal experience here but from observation of others. My own skills as a footballer seem to me as sharp as they ever were. Some have pointed out that this notion is sustained by the fact that I have not actually played even a vaguely competitive game for 25 years. Such comments are, I'm afraid to say, based on much the same virulent strain of envy that has led some of my colleagues to mock poor Frank Lampard just because the topless midfield beauty's attempt to market his own sweat as a luxury body lotion and psoriasis cure has not been quite the commercial success his people had envisaged. Those doubters who feel the failure of his venture indicates that public opinion has turned against the Chelsea man would do well to remember the utterances of Ian Faith, splendid manager of Spinal Tap: it's not that Frank is less popular than he once was, it's just that his popularity has become more selective. Lampard is no spring chicken (although he's almost as hairless as one), and I am genuinely looking forward to seeing a gradually increased level of high-class pointing from him over the next few seasons. Whether he will be able to reproduce his club pointing form when he is in an England shirt is another matter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
