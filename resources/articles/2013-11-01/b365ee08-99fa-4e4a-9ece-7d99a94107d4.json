Blur were set to appear at the nationwide festivals, and had top billing along with Arcade Fire and Pearl Jam. \u201cDevastated to report that Blur won't be performing at BDO in 2014. It\u2019s a shock that it has come to this,\u201d read the band\u2019s statement. \u201cOnly eight weeks to go, the band feels that with the constantly shifting goalposts and challenging conditions of the organisers, they can't let it drag on any longer and want to make this announcement, to be clear to Blur fans that they won't be there. We've done our very best to work with the organisers and considered every option to make it happen, but they\u2019ve let us down and let everyone else down too.\u201d Many fans were angry at the news, saying they only bought tickets to the festival to see Blur. Last week it was announced that Blur would not be doing any sideshows, making the Big Day Out the only chance for fans to catch the Britpop band. Arcade Fire and other acts from the lineup, including Snoop Dogg, Primus, Major Lazer and the Lumineers are performing extra shows during the tour. Festival organisers and promoters claim they\u2019re at a loss to explain the cancellation, which came as a surprise to them. New Zealand promoter Campbell Smith said he had \u201cno idea\u201d. \u201cAs soon as I find out what happened and what will happen, I will advise,\u201d Smith announced on Facebook. Australian promoter and recent Big Day Out investor AJ Maddah, said that as far as he was aware, the only request by Blur that was refused was to swap set times with Arcade Fire. \u201cFar as I know, BDO gave into every demand within the possibility of curfews &amp; public safety,\u201d tweeted Maddah, adding later, \u201cNot sure why they would blame festival when all everyone here has done is kiss their ass.\u201d CEO of the Big Day Out, Adam Zammit, said they were looking for a replacement band, and have already ruled out Daft Punk. \u201cEvent is charging ahead despite Blur\u2019s action. Announcement and statement soon,\u201d he said. Fans who are not satisfied with the replacement band will be able to get a refund, according to the ticketing policy, which allows for people who no longer wish to attend if a \u201cheadline act of an event is changed\u201d. The festival begins on 17 January in Auckland, New Zealand, before touring around major Australian cities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
