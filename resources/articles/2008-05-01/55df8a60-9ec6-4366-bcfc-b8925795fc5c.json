Lubos Michel and his assistant Roman Slysko have been held in low esteem by followers of Chelsea since they ruled that Garc\u00eda's early goal in the second leg of the tie at Anfield had crossed the line. It proved to be the only one and Chelsea were left with a sense of injustice. Nobody stewed quite like Jose Mourinho. \"It was a goal that came from the moon - from the Anfield stands,\" said Chelsea's then manager, who would also describe it as a \"ghost goal\". \"Liverpool scored,\" he added, \"if you can say that they scored, because maybe you should say the linesman scored.\" Michel, 40 last Friday, and Slysko, 34, are joined by Martin Balko, 36, the other assistant. A fourth Slovakian, Vladimir Hrinak, will act as the fourth official. Michel has refereed Chelsea on two other occasions - in the Champions League group fixture against CSKA Moscow in 2004, which they won 2-0, and a game at Werder Bremen last season which they lost 1-0. He has refereed United on six occasions, twice in the knockout stages of the Champions League. He oversaw their 2-2 draw with Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of the 2002 semi-final and the 7-1 win over Roma in the second leg of last season's quarter-final. He is also known to British audiences for his handling of the 2003 Uefa Cup final between Mourinho's Porto and Martin O'Neill's Celtic. O'Neill was deeply unhappy with Michel's performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
