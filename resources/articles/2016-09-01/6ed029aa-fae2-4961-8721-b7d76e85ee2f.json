A report by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) and the Family and Childcare Trust says extended school services are popular with schools and families and can improve children\u2019s outcomes, but current provision is failing to meet parents\u2019 demands for after-school and holiday childcare. Almost two fifths (39%) of schools surveyed for the report said parents wanted holiday provision, but only 29% of schools were able to offer it. For after-school childcare, provided by just over half of schools, the shortfall was 11 percentage points and was particularly acute in primary schools. The report, published on Wednesday, calls on the government to provide a clear vision to encourage schools to extend their services and provide dedicated funding to pay for it. \u201cWithout this, existing services risk withering on the vine, becoming increasingly reliant on parental contributions and therefore inaccessible to the most deprived children,\u201d it warns. The term extended schools refers to services offered through a school to pupils and the wider community, including sports, arts and homework clubs, as well as wraparound and holiday childcare. The aim is to enable children \u2013 particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2013 to broaden their interests through extra-curricular activities and simultaneously free up their parents to work, reducing the risk of child poverty. The research found that children from deprived families use the out-of-school services as much as their better off peers in the vast majority of schools, but in a small but significant minority, poorer families use them less \u2013 possibly because they cannot afford the parental contributions most schools require. Of those surveyed, 84% of head teachers said their extended services were used by a mix of more and less advantaged families, but 10% said their services were used disproportionately by better-off families even though the services are usually part-funded by the pupil premium, which is additional money for schools to raise attainment among disadvantaged pupils. Three quarters of schools that took part in the survey said they would like to expand the numbers using their extended services and the range of services offered and a third wanted to expand their hours. Two thirds of schools, however, said they could not expand because of a lack of funding, 47% were constrained by limited space and 54% had problems with staffing. CPAG\u2019s chief executive, Alison Garnham, said it was worrying that the most disadvantaged children were not full engaging with the extended services on offer at some schools, when they were the children who most needed them. \u201cDone well, out-of-school services can achieve a huge amount both for children\u2019s development and for parents who need childcare in order to work but, in recent years, the idea has been allowed to go off the boil. \u201cIf ever there was a time to invest in extended schools, it\u2019s now - when two thirds of poor children are in working households and the child poverty rate is set to surge. Parents trust schools and want more childcare and schools want to provide it but don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d Garnham called on the government to provide a coherent vision and adequate funding \u201cso that every parent who needs to improve their family income can do so in the knowledge that their kids have a safe and nurturing place to be that doesn\u2019t smash the family budget\u201d. According to the report, 2% of schools surveyed did not offer any kind of provision despite the 2005 policy that required all schools to provide a core of extended provision by 2010. Megan Jarvie, head of policy and public affairs at the Family and Childcare Trust, said extended schools services helped boost outcomes for children from all backgrounds. \u201cThe extra-curricular activities and homework support help children to achieve academically and build their soft skills,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also provide childcare to enable parents to work. Our own recent research showed high costs and big gaps for families when it comes to finding formal holiday childcare. We would like to see real commitment to increasing availability to meet demand, with a particular focus on deprived areas.\u201d The report, entitled Unfinished Business: Where Next for Extended Schools, is based on an online survey of more than 1,000 head teachers of English primary and secondary schools in May 2015. It also draws on the findings of an online survey by YouGov, undertaken to gauge the attitudes and interests of children towards before- and after-school activities. A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe are doing more than ever before to support families with childcare so they can balance work with their family lives. This includes investing a record \u00a36bn in childcare by the end of this parliament and doubling our free offer for three-and four-year olds, which can be used during the holidays and out of school hours.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
