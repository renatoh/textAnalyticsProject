Could it be that the bloated excrescence that is the capital's property market is finally going to pop? This week Spicerhaart, the country's biggest independent estate agency, said the number of viewings per property in London had fallen by nearly a third since the same time last year. Even the Monopoly money that has fuelled the \"super-prime\" Mayfair market is running short, with upmarket agents Knight Frank reporting price growth at its weakest since January 2011. Asking prices in London on Rightmove, the biggest property search website, have fallen for the last two months, and on Monday it will report they are down again. The law of gravity for so long defied by the capital appears to be reasserting itself. Maybe this should come as no surprise; the near-vertical rise in London prices, with some boroughs witnessing 30% price growth over the last 12 months, has taken the average home price to within a whisker of half a million quid. First-time buyers are having to pay nine times their income to secure a home: a record high, and a truly phenomenal increase from the three-to-four-times-income level that lasted from 1991 to 1999. Are buyers going on strike? The mundane answer may be that they simply can't amass the finance to buy. The mortgage market review (MMR), imposed by regulators to avoid a repeat of the lax lending and \"liar loans\" common before the financial crisis, has already curtailed borrowers from taking jumbo-sized mortgages. From October, the Bank of England will force lenders to keep a tight rein on lending at high income multiples (although its new cap of four-and-a-half times joint income is curiously identical to the nine times income that prices have already reached). Others are repelled by fears of interest rate rises. The stock market is already sending strong signals. The share prices of the housebuilders, which surged dramatically when George Osborne announced Help to Buy in March 2013, have gone into reverse. Since March, Barratt is down 20% and Bovis down 15%. Persimmon and Bovis issue their results this week and any updates on trading will be closely examined. But for all those crossing their fingers, arms and legs and hoping that the boom is coming to an end, there are others for whom it never really got started. The reality is that prices nationally are only 6.5% above their peak in 2007, and once London and the south-east is stripped out, the rebound looks fragile indeed. Prices in the north-east, the north-west and Yorkshire and Humberside remain around 5% below their 2007 level; in Northern Ireland they are an astonishing 49% below their Celtic tiger-fuelled highs. That's why the Bank of England is quietly confident that the MMR, plus caps on lending, will take the froth off the London market without throwing the rest of the UK into the doldrums. British households remain heavily indebted, making the Bank deeply hesitant about raising rates. Given that wage rises are virtually invisible \u2013 and that the eurozone economy is heading into reverse \u2013 the prospect of an early rate rise is receding yet again. The fundamentals that have driven the London price spiral \u2013 deeply restricted supply, a fast-growing population, cash buyers, investor-landlords and the capital's admittedly vulgar role as a safe haven for the global elite's billions \u2013 are still largely in place. The irony is that the cheerleaders for a price crash want one thing only: to buy. With such a large reservoir of potential buyers, it's difficult to envisage much more than a pause in prices. Independent analysts such as Capital Economics talk of 6% London price growth next year, and 2% the year after, which, though a long way short of the recent pace, still suggests a \u00a3500,000 apartment will be \u00a3540,000 in 2016. Hardly the sound of a bubble popping. Slim pickings for grocers Wasting food of any kind has long been an unpleasant idea to anyone brought up during the second world war, when sweets were rare and the ration book a way of life. But who would have thought that 21st-century shoppers too would come to \"love their leftovers\", buy little and often to avoid waste and voluntarily limit their food purchases in the same way as their parents and grandparents? This time, the war going on is among the gGrocers are busily slashing prices to try to compete with the growing threat of the low-cost operators Aldi and Lidl. But figures out last week appear to confirm that price cuts and the growth of convenience and online retailing are not the only thing making life tough for supermarkets. The likes of Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's are also dealing with their first significant fall in the volume of goods sold since 1945, according to analysts at IRI. Hot drinks and food in tins and packets were down, frozen food was down, sweets sales fell 2.4%. The figures do not include fresh food, but insiders say fruit and veg sales are also declining. In contrast to the theme of wartime austerity, the amount of beer and cider sold was up more than 6%, but that was thought to be due more to the World Cup than a long-term trend. The IRI figures focus on the main supermarkets, and so are not picking up how much of those items are now being bought at discounters such as Poundland, B&amp;M, Aldi and Lidl. Perhaps this is no surprise. The recovery is not filtering through to workers' wallets: the Office for National Statistics last week revealed that wages fell for the first time since the 2009 recession for the April-June quarter, despite a fall in the jobless rate to its lowest since 2008. And there is a grave danger for supermarkets here. Even when, or if, disposable incomes do start rising, the postwar experience shows that it can take a generation for shopping habits to change. Tesco and Morrisons are only just getting to grips with the action they need to take on prices to fend off the Aldi effect. A permanent shift in the volume of goods sold is likely to be just as damaging. Is music news fit to print? For all the laments about the impact of digitisation on book publishing, spare a thought for those working on magazines. While Amazon's clash with Hachette has generated headlines over the threat to authors, a future generation of music journalists are at risk. In its heyday, New Musical Express was a cultural institution, carrying the exalted bylines of the likes of Julie Burchill, Nick Kent and Steven Wells. Now its print edition has been ravaged by the internet, with a weekly circulation of just 14,000 \u2013 down more than a quarter on a year ago \u2013 according to figures published last week. If you include all platforms its \"reach\" is more than 3.6 million people, but as its circulation has dwindled, so has the cutting-edge quality of its journalism. And this is being repeated across the industry. Nearly a million print magazine sales have been lost over the past six months. There will be casualties and the NME's print edition could be one of them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
