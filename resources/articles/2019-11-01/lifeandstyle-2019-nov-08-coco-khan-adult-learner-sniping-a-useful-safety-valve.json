Six. Hundred. Thousand. Pounds. \u201cShall we leave?\u201d I whispered to my friend. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cLet\u2019s snoop.\u201d Usually, I love looking at houses. My faves are the ones with character, chock-full of knick-knacks that tell a story. This house was different \u2013 immaculately designed in hues of walnut. Everything was curated just so: reclaimed floorboards, period doors, a butler sink and antique furniture that looked inherited. I figured the owners were wealthy. I was strangely rattled. \u201cThey had a whole shelf dedicated to grains in kilner jars,\u201d I ranted later, \u201call smugly labelled \u2013 spelt, barley \u2013 and they grew grapes in their conservatory.\u201d \u201cThought you liked grapes?\u201d said my rational friend, Steve. \u201cNot the point, it\u2019s... oh, shut up, Steve!\u201d It\u2019s true: I love grapes. I also think organising your grains is sensible. But I interpreted these details as assertions of power. I pictured the owners writing letters to MPs at their Edwardian bureau, eating foie gras naked but for one of those colonial-era leopard rugs. The next day I took to Google. \u201cWhy am I such a bitch?\u201d The answer? Unresolved stress. It makes sense: a few weeks earlier, my own attempt to move fell through, thwarted by ruthless landlords, in a city run by landlords, in a country of haves and have-nots. The reason we snipe is that we\u2019re frustrated. I\u2019m glad to have learned this. But I also learned that sniping is letting off steam; it helps you to cope and it is harmless if fleeting. Hey, maybe it can even be fun. I certainly laughed, picturing it: \u201cDear right honorable sir, please forgive my naked ambition\u2026\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
