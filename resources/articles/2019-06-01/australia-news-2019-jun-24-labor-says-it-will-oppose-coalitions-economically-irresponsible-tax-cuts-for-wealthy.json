As Labor called on the government to bring forward some of its proposed tax cuts and boost infrastructure spending to fend off a looming downturn, the government warned that the opposition had failed to learn the lessons of the election by standing in the way of tax relief for all workers. Following a meeting of shadow cabinet in Melbourne on Monday morning, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the party had resolved to support stage one of the government\u2019s plan to give a tax cut to low and middle income earners, but would stay \u201cfirm\u201d in its opposition to the final stage that would reduce the tax rate from 32.5 cents in the dollar to 30 cents for people earning between $45,000 and $200,000. \u201cWhat we have determined this morning to do is to propose a negotiating position to the government which would bring forward tax cuts faster for those who need it, and importantly those who will spend it, to stimulate demand in the economy,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWhat we know right now is that the economy needs stimulus. And what we\u2019re looking for here is solutions rather than arguments.\u201d Albanese called for \u201cshovel ready\u201d infrastructure projects to be brought forward, and called for the already legislated measure to lift the threshold for the 37 cent tax rate from $90,000 to $120,000 \u2013 which it had pledged to repeal had it won the election \u2013 to start this year. Under the coalition\u2019s plan, the threshold change would come into effect in July 2022. Labor said bringing this forward to 2019-20 would cost $3.7bn and provide an immediate boost of $1350 for those earning more than $90,000. Albanese said that if the government agreed to its proposed rejig of the tax package and deferred the third stage, then Labor would \u201cfacilitate\u201d passage of the first two stages. But its demand for the government to respond to its \u201cconstructive approach\u201d ahead of the legislation being introduced next week, was immediately shot down by Finance Minister, Mathias Cormann, who said the government would not split the bill. \u201cLabor have still not learnt the lessons from the election,\u201d he said. \u201cOur plan prioritises low and middle income earners, takes the bracket creep monkey off people\u2019s back, is economically necessary and fiscally responsible and, importantly, it is what Australians voted for.\u201d Labor\u2019s decision to \u201cstand firm\u201d against stage three of the package comes despite public calls from senior frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon and backbencher Peter Khalil to back the coalition\u2019s full tax plan in full. \u201cMy starting point is that you can\u2019t deny the punters a tax cut from opposition particularly so soon after an election where we had our backsides kicked,\u201d Fitzgibbon told ABC Radio National on Monday morning ahead of the meeting. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to give our political opponents the opportunity to blame us for a bad economy, an economy which has gone bad on their watch.\u201d But Albanese said the shadow cabinet had decided the $95bn cost of the third tranche, due to come into effect in 2024-25, could not be justified in a soft economy. \u201cWe think that stage three - at a cost of some $95 billion down the track ... is really a triumph of hope over economic reality.\u201d \u201cWhat we are doing is standing firm with regard to our position on stage three. But we\u2019re also saying very clearly that we are prepared to act in the national economic interest and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing by having faster tax cuts and concentrating them in the area where people will spend them because of the nature of what happens when you give someone on a lower or middle income a tax cut as opposed to a higher income.\u201d He said there was a range of road and rail packages that could be brought forward because \u201cthey\u2019re ready to go right now\u201d, naming the Melbourne metro project and Linkfield Road in Brisbane\u2019s north as possible contenders. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to sit down with the government and identify projects, some of which were committed to by both sides of politics during the election campaign.\u201d \u201cWe know that projects like that are necessary now and we think that a bring-forward of the government\u2019s proposed infrastructure investment would assist the economy, create jobs right now, help to boost productivity into the future.\u201d Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the government had \u201cno idea\u201d how to turn the economy around, saying Labor was concerned about weak consumption and low wage growth. \u201cWe have got a problem with consumption and we have got a problem with productivity, and what we are proposing today is a plan, a solution, or at least something that would help turn around those issues in the economy which are leading to the slowest growth for the 10 years since the global financial crisis.\u201d The Coalition has repeatedly ruled out splitting the tax package as demanded by Labor, and is negotiating with the crossbench to try to pass the three stage plan without the support of Labor. The Opposition has not said whether it will block the passage of the legislation if its votes are needed for it to come into effect. Speaking in Perth on Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said tax relief was needed to help boost consumer sentiment. \u201cLabor\u2019s internal conniptions about supporting the Government\u2019s plan to simply let Australians keep more of what they earn exposes Labor\u2019s deep mistrust of Australians to do what\u2019s best for them with their own money,\u201d he said. \u201cOur proposed tax relief doesn\u2019t just have a strong political mandate. It has a compelling policy rational.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
