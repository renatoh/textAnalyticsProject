They are walking around with long faces, shaking their heads and vowing \"never again!\" These are the ones who overdid it at Tony Cozier's infamous traditional pre-Test beach party rather than supporters of the West Indian cricket team. Most of the Cozier-induced hangovers will be gone once the game gets under way today. The pain caused by the crisis in West Indies cricket will take longer to disappear. Trouble is that when one side is losing, another one has to win. That means England, whose own supporters have extreme difficulty coping with the situation. Jumbo jet after jumbo jet has decanted its load here over the past few days for the greatest bonanza in cricket travel: the back-to-back Eastertime Tests against England on the holiday isles of Barbados and Antigua. England have not been here for six years and, gosh, the Bajans are pleased to see us. It is the biggest tourist event on their calendar - the post-harvest carnival of Crop Over can't match it - and is impervious to England's fortunes and economics. Remember the fuss about price gouging when the West Indies board upped overseas ticket prices to about 10 times the local rate? They have got away with it (and shrewdies have found ways round it). Every hotel on the island is still jammed solid with English cricket followers in their unmistakable uniform: polo or T-shirt, scruffy shorts, flabby legs; pristine white socks; sandals or trainers. If you saw one in the Sahara, you'd say: \"I didn't know there was a Test match on.\" The tourists used to be known to the players and travelling hacks as \"Winks\" (short for Wankers Incorporated) on the grounds that some of them were a bit, well, boring. In these sensitive days, this is partially being superseded by \"Hillmans\" (Hillman Hunters, punters). What worries me is whether they are suitable cheerleaders for the new turbo-charged England. I was chatting to a Hillman at Gatwick on the way out. \"I hope we don't beat them too badly,\" he said. \"The game needs a strong West Indies team\". He was not the first Englishman to express such sentiments to me over the past month. Not beat them too badly! Here we are, contemplating the possibility of reversing the humiliations of the 1980s with a whitewash (or a red-white-and-bluewash; or, maybe, to match the changing complexions of the Hillmans, a beige-pink-and-beetrootwash). When England suffered two successive blackwashes in the mid-1980s, did any West Indian say: \"Don't beat them too badly, Vivi mon\"? Did anyone express even a pang of contrition in the 27 years, ending in 2000, during which West Indies held the Wisden Trophy? They did not. When Curtly Ambrose's mum rang her bell to celebrate each of her little lad's 405 wickets, did she give so much as a tinkle for England? Did she heck! It is in the nature of an international game played by only 10 countries that at any given time some teams will be suffering a high-profile rough patch. England's has lasted most of the past half-century. It is time for a change. The fact that West Indies are in eclipse after three generations of almost unalloyed brilliance should not alarm the rest of us. Cricket will not disappear here; it is too important to the Caribbean identity, and the economy. But the West Indies are taking refuge in nostalgia, the traditional English response to cricketing disaster. This week they have unveiled a bust of Malcolm Marshall and a plaque to Sir Frank Worrell. They have honoured Sir Garfield Sobers, on the 50th anniversary of his Test debut. More recent legends such as Desmond Haynes have been chuntering about the current team's indiscipline. This is not quite the reverse of the blackwash years. David Gower's team of 1985-86 were savaged, especially in retrospect, for their lackadaisical attitude, expressed through post-defeat windsurfing and \"optional nets\". Frankly, the gap between England and that terrifying West Indian team was such that, had the players stopped laughing, they would have cried. At that time, too, the notion that professional sportsmen might actually enjoy themselves had not entirely been surrendered. The world has now moved on. International teams are more committed and far better able to get the best from the available material. That is certainly true of England. In terms of ability, the two teams seem well matched. West Indies, however, have thought for too long they can get by on flair alone. That may change; the new manager, Tony Howard, is saying the right things. The balance of power may even change by tonight. In the meantime, as Margaret Thatcher said after the recapture of Port Stanley: \"Just rejoice!\" Never mind the opposition. English cricket must savour the good times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
