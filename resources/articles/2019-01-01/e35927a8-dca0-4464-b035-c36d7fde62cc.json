In all, 18 wickets fell and amid the carnage England will be left with a huge victory target in the context of this match. The tourists\u2019 batsmen came and went more rapidly than those from West Indies. On a deceptively serene afternoon England were bowled out for 77, a deficit of 212 runs after the completion of two innings. The hordes of travelling fans looked on in a state of silent shock. After all, this was the 21st century and such a procession of disconsolate England players against West Indies pacemen was no longer meant to be around every corner. Then the home batsmen were infected as they lost five wickets for nine runs in the final session against the combination of Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali. But powered by the irrepressible Shimron Hetmyer with spirited assistance from Shane Dowrich in a 59-run partnership, once again West Indies held a mighty lead of 339, though Hetmyer fell to Sam Curran late in the day. Seventy-seven was not the lowest score cobbled together by an England team touring the Caribbean yet this capitulation was certainly more shocking than the 46 all out in Trinidad in 1994, an experience that may not have been forgotten by England\u2019s batting coach, Mark Ramprakash. Then the predictable tormentors were Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. In 2009 at Sabina Park England were dispatched for 51 at the hands of Jerome Taylor and Sulieman Benn, a less likely source of humiliation. Here Kemar Roach, in a devastating spell after lunch of five for 13 from eight overs, was the architect of England\u2019s hapless downfall. Jason Holder supported him brilliantly, yielding nothing and picking up two vital wickets. Then at the end of the innings West Indies\u2019 two fastest bowlers, Alzarri Joseph and Shannon Gabriel, chipped in with three scalps just to ensure their confidence is high when they start bowling again. To no one\u2019s surprise West Indies declined to enforce the follow-on, not a decision that would have been taxing Holder overnight even though his side had been in the field for only 30.2 overs. So despite that flurry of wickets in West Indies\u2019 second innings this represents a horror scenario for the tourists and the unsmiling visage of Jimmy Anderson provided vivid confirmation. He and Stokes had finished off West Indies\u2019 first innings in the morning, albeit after more exhilarating strokeplay from Hetmyer. As he left the field Anderson might have been quietly content with figures of five for 46 from 30 overs, his 27th five-wicket haul, which equals Ian Botham\u2019s record. Now at last he could put his feet up \u2013 for about two hours as it happened. Before the lunch there was no sign of the mayhem to follow. Keaton Jennings departed for 17 slicing a catch to Shai Hope in the gully off Holder, an occupational hazard perhaps and no great surprise. It transpired Jennings would be the highest scorer in the innings. With England 30 for one there seemed to be all to play for but the batsmen were mesmerised by the unrelenting discipline of Roach and Holder allied to some uneven bounce. There was no catalogue of rash strokes, though Moeen Ali\u2019s instinctive hoick against a first-ball bouncer was a vivid encapsulation of England\u2019s ineptitude, which will remain a painful memory of a chaotic afternoon. Roach bowled Rory Burns and Jonny Bairstow, the ball ricocheting from the former\u2019s bat and the latter\u2019s elbow. Then Holder snatched the wicket of Joe Root, who was lbw to a delivery that jagged into his pads, a familiar mode of dismissal for the England captain and one which was so plumb that it was not worth reviewing. The West Indies\u2019 celebrations now started in earnest for Root is the most coveted wicket. Now they sensed a golden opportunity. Even so it was surprising that no one could hinder them. Stokes was strokeless against the relentless Roach and lbw for a duck to his 17th delivery; Jos Buttler was stunned by a lifter before Joseph and Gabriel mopped up in time for an early tea. No matter how many of their lineup could boast first-class centuries, which applies to everyone except the forlorn Anderson, England had exhibited the solidity of a marshmallow at the crease. Moreover the raised eyebrows at some of their decisions before the match had given way to raised voices. Now it was hard to avoid the conclusion that some of those tough \u201cgut\u201d calls taken by Root had not worked out. For West Indies the four pacemen had prevailed with staggering ease. All four ran in rhythmically and hit the wicket hard and they found enough movement to defeat tentative batsmen. All except Roach exploited their height and Gabriel, in particular, caused some consternation with his short deliveries, especially the one that dismissed Curran. England had put so much faith in the capacity of the Duke ball to swing they preferred Curran and Rashid to Broad, who may well be of the opinion that he might have bowled quite effectively on this track. And he may well be right. Broad \u2013 and Chris Woakes \u2013 would not have witnessed their team\u2019s collapse since they were not at the ground. There is an enlightened policy of giving squad players time off on a rotational basis on what was optimistically described as \u201cbatting days\u201d. Well, they had a couple of hours off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
