He skipped the bits about bans on watering sports grounds and allotments and went straight to item four: \"Garden ponds.\" \"What about my Koi carp?\" he asked. \"Don't say I cannot fill up my pond. I've got 20 really big ones and 400 small ones. They mean everything to me. They are worth a fortune,\" he said. Mr Thurston reckons he tops up his two-metre-deep pond with \"about\" 1,000 gallons of water a week, and a call to the water company reassured him yesterday he could carry on. He may no longer wash his car with a pressure hose, he will have to turn his mini-fountain off and he must not hose down either of his houses, but, he said: \"That's not important. You have to have priorities in the circumstances, and mine are my fish. I would go without a bath for them, I would queue in the streets for them.\" The idea of the inhabitants of East Surrey queuing for water at standpipes later this summer is a rich one. The area south-west of London, which used to be called the stockbroker belt, is home to some of the wealthiest, most water-profligate people in Britain. The 340 sq mile patch served by the water company includes 50 golf courses, each using up to 7m litres of water a season, 2,000 private swimming pools and possibly the most power showers and dishwashers a square metre outside central London. East Surrey's consumers use an average 170 litres of water each a day, at least 20% more than the national figure. The company hopes the drought may cut water use in the area by 25%. \"They have to be joking,\" said Ian, a driver in Cobham, yesterday. \"People around here would rather bath in Perrier than go without. If it came to standpipes, they would take on more staff to queue for them. I would say most people round here haven't a clue there is even a drought. Droughts do not happen to rich people.\" On St George's Hill, outside Cobham, where the Digger land reformers made their stand in 1755, the idea of a shortage of anything seemed improbable yesterday. The asking prices for the 400-odd houses in this gated community start at about \u00a32m, and the lawns that could be glimpsed behind high walls and hedges were as immaculate as golf greens. \"I could not comment at all on how people here will cope with a drought, or whether they will cut back on water,\" said the estate manager. \"People around here do a lot of car-washing, and there are not many dirty Ferraris,\" said a salesman at Trenchard Arlidge estate agents in the town centre, where new two bedroomed flats start at around \u00a3375,000 and most have the latest in aqua-chic: integrated household and garden irrigation systems. \"Are people water aware? Older people who went through the war are, but this is an area of plenty. Shortages here would be a wake-up call,\" he said. The prospect of water restrictions was certainly shocking for Halil, a Kosovan running a busy car-wash line outside Leatherhead, where dozens of cars queued yesterday to be power-hosed by any number of European nationalities. \"They cannot, they will never, stop this business,\" he said. \"Fifteen people work here. We pay a fortune to the water company. Last week I paid a bill of \u00a3900.\" But a call to Sutton and East Surrey Company suggested Mr Halil and many other people running small car-washing firms in the area may be out of work when the drought order begins on May 27. \"The only exceptions [will be for firms that] use 23 litres of water a car or ones that recycle their water. I suggest they call us,\" said a spokeswoman. Pip Elson, a director at nearby Burnhill golf club - \"annual charges about \u00a31,300, dramatic water features\" - was \"reasonably confident\" yesterday that something could be worked out to keep his greens green. The group that owns the club, and eight others, \"is seeing the Environment Agency right now,\" he said. \"Actually, we have not started watering yet. It's been wet.\" But the water company was adamant: \"There can be no exceptions for golf clubs - none whatever.\" At the Miramar cafe in Cobham, Charlene, a South African student, was nonplussed at British reactions to water shortages. \"Where I come from, we all know about water and never waste it. I think people around here do not understand that.\" At that point it started raining heavily, and Charlene ran outside to bring in the tables."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
