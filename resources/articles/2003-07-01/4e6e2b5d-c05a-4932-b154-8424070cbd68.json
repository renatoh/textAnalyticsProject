The Malton trainer has won the valuable five-furlong dash with Flanders in 1998 and Good Girl two years ago. Danesmead is a half-brother to Good Girl and clearly possesses some of her speed, as he showed when finishing second of 17 to Carrizo Creek in a six-furlong sales race at the Curragh at the end of last month. \"He's in good form,\" Easterby said yesterday. \"Ideally he'd like a bit of cut in the ground. That would slow the others down a bit. It's a very fast race, but if he can lay up with them, I think he'll run well.\" Easterby is also hoping to run Somnus in the David Wilson Homes Stakes on the same card. A smart juvenile last year, Somnus returned to form with a convincing success at Haydock Park earlier this month. Easterby added: \"It was nice to see him back winning last week and if they get a bit of rain he'll run.\" His prayers could be answered, according to Newbury's clerk of the course Richard Osgood, who said: \"The going is good to firm, but we are due to get some rain today.\" Ladbrokes are quoting a special price of 5-1 for Zuhair to strike for a record fifth time in a race named in his honour at Glorious Goodwood. The 10-year-old, trained by David Nicholls, has won the Zuhair Stakes, a five-furlong handicap formerly known as the Charlton Stakes, four times in a row."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
