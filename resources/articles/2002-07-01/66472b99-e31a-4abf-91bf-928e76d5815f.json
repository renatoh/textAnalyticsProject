An announcement could be imminent that the channel created by Sir Jeremy Isaacs, formerly general manager of the Royal Opera House and head of Channel 4, will cease broadcasting at the end of July. Executives are likely to blame competition from the BBC4 which began broadcasting less than a year ago. The expected closure of the channel is likely to add fuel to an already fevered debate on whether the BBC's public service remit fits with the funding of niche digital channels that have commercial rivals. Broadcasts on Artsworld included items on poetry, architecture, literature, dance and design. Shareholders in the company, which include Guardian Media Group, the publisher of the Guardian, are said to have been reluctant to commit new funding to a start-up pitched against a rival boasting a budget estimated at between \u00a325-30m a year. About 100,000 subscribers signed up to pay \u00a35.99 a month for the only digital satellite channel devoted to performance of the live arts. However, insiders say that about 140,000 subscribers were needed to make the business viable. \"There is a remote chance the channel will be saved but it is just that, remote,\" said a source close to the firm. It is thought \u00a32-3m would be needed to secure the channel's future and \u00a34-5m to allow the channel to develop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
