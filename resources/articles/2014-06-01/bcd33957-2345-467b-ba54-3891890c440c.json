His third album further affirms his reputation as an elusive figure; taking inspiration from the likes of Arvo P\u00e4rt, Philip Glass, Henryk G\u00f3recki and Edward Elgar, he lavishes just as much sincerity into his arrangements as his words, despite being unable to read or write music. Where previously his music was characterised by morbid lyricism and weary vocal tremors, this entirely instrumental album has an instinctive feeling of sorrow. The strings in Field are sob-inducing, and Healah Dancing is spellbinding. Delicate and mournful, yet without self-pity, Romantic Works is remarkable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
