It helped transform popular perceptions of urban working-class life and, presciently, foresaw a host of issues about the workings of community with which we are still grappling. This week sees the republishing of Michael Young and Peter Willmott's Family and Kinship in East London - arguably the most influential piece of sociology in Britain in the 20th century - to mark its 50th anniversary. What Young and Willmott did was listen to the voices of a community in postwar Bethnal Green that, for many decades, had either been pitied or vilified. The voices they found described a world rich in social relationships, networks of dependence and mutual support that were central to the people's resilience in facing the adversity of insecure and low-paid employment. They charted what would now be described by policymakers as \"social capital\" and how it made urban neighbourhoods function effectively. They accorded proper significance to the pivotal role of women and their relationships - how they raised children, held families and communities together. But the book was more than ethnography; it was intended as a stark warning of how a bureaucratic, centralised planning system could override the needs of the people it was intended to serve. Well-intentioned policies to clear slums and ease the desperate shortage of housing by moving people into new blocks of flats or into Essex, took no regard of this network of relationships and left communities deracinated and disorientated. It had huge influence on planners and policymakers in the second half of the 20th century. Arguably, we are more preoccupied than ever by questions of how government policy can strengthen social networks. The book also launched a debate among researchers that still rumbles on as to whether the picture portrayed was sentimental and romanticised, or an accurate representation of a golden age of urban English community on the cusp of being wrenched apart by massive economic dislocation in the 60s with the decline of the docks. Indeed, that it was the latter, and the social changes it brought in its wake - in particular, the rise of female employment - which did more to disrupt social networks than housing policy. Given its impact, it's not surprising that Young decided to return to Bethnal Green for a follow-up study in 1992, which was finally published (with co-authors Kate Gavron and Geoff Dench) last year as The New East End: Kinship, Race and Conflict. It reflected some of the preoccupations of Family and Kinship, attempting to trace the impact of government policy and its unintended consequences on communities. It controversially argued that administration of local housing policy had benefited Bangladeshis, leaving the white working class resentful and had contributed to the rise of racism in Tower Hamlets through the 80s and 90s. Trevor Phillips, then chair of the Commission for Racial Equality and now head of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, declared the book, \"one of the most important I've read for a long time\". The very affection and respect accorded to Family and Kinship seems to have only intensified the furious criticism its sequel has attracted over the last year. Earlier this month, a bitter meeting at the British Sociological Association aired some of the fury. The criticism of sociologists is vociferous. They argue it is \"incompetent\", lacking any academic rigour and more about opinionated polemic than evidence. But this is more than an academic spat. People at the heart of the housing battles of Tower Hamlets in the 80s - residents, campaigners and housing officers - are equally perturbed. They argue it omits crucial elements of the wider picture; that it goes beyond explaining white racism to justifying it. \"As recent migrants to Bethnal Green have tended to be more needy, their needs have taken priority. We argue the indigenous working class understand this all too easily, and this feeds their hostility towards migrants. They see their welfare state as having been adapted to suit migrants and morally undermined in the process,\" argues The New East End. It concludes that: \"the state's reception of newcomers has ridden over the existing local community's assumptions about their ownership of public resources, and this has precipitated a loss of confidence in the fairness of social democracy.\" What charges the controversy with particular force is the perception that this book played directly into highly charged current political debates about who is entitled to the benefits of the welfare state, immigration, and how Labour responds to the electoral gains of the British National party in areas such as Essex. Only last week, immigration minister Liam Byrne drew attention to the disproportionate impact on poorer communities of migration, and warned that Labour ignored white resentment at its electoral peril. The New East End, claim its critics, played into the debate launched by David Goodhart, editor of Prospect, who argues that there is a trade-off between solidarity and diversity - the more of the latter reduces the former and, in so doing, reduces the will to contribute to welfare systems built on solidarity. \"I've never read a book which I felt like challenging every sentence,\" says Mark Adams, who was a housing officer in Tower Hamlets through much of the 80s and 90s. He disputes their analysis of how housing policy was determined by a new needs-based approach to welfare and how, in the borough, that meant Bangladeshis got housing before white residents. \"My report in 1994 showed how the council didn't apply need and repeatedly discriminated against Bangladeshis in favour of whites. The reality is the opposite of what they claimed,\" said Adams, adding that repeated investigations in the 80s and early 90s uncovered evidence of systematic discrimination in housing policy against Bangladeshis. \"What they omit is that there was some joint action ... they also omit the fact that there was a very high level of racial violence on the streets. Even if all the housing problems had been solved, the racism would still need to have been tackled - there's a long history of it in the East End with anti-semitism and anti-Irish sentiment.\" Robert Moore, emeritus professor of sociology at Liverpool University, who has written on race and immigration since the 60s, argues that the book \"ignores racial tensions stirred up by the public rhetoric on asylum and immigration in the period. You can't say all racism is based on welfare policies. The notion that Bangladeshis found a generous welfare state is a real misunderstanding.\" Bangladeshis are depicted as largely passive recipients of a middle-class \"do-good\" type of welfare generosity, but researchers argue this erases the struggle of a generation of small Bangladeshi groups who campaigned for racial justice. Kate Gavron, one of the authors, insists it simply records the views of the white population. But others feel these views are not borne out by the evidence. \"I felt libelled ... it was a complete misrepresentation of how Tower Hamlets changed. My children said it was like BNP propaganda,\" said Eileen Short, who has lived and been active in her council tenant association in Tower Hamlets for nearly 30 years. \"There was a history of white racism but we moved on and people were fighting alongside each other against things such as privatising council houses. We created something different here - council housing is not segregated - and I'm proud of it.\" The book's most important failing was in not confronting the very knotty problem it attempts to describe, argues Michael Keith, a Tower Hamlets councillor from 1994 to 2006 and professor of sociology at Goldsmiths College. The resources of the welfare state are scarce, so some rationing is required, particularly in very deprived areas, explains Keith, and there is a real tension about whether that should be according to notions of membership (people who have lived in a community longest) or according to most pressing need, which is likely to benefit newcomers. The latter has moral authority but the former must also be weighed in the balance. Keith concedes that the book raises an important issue about the impact on white working class of migration, which is very topical, but says it's a debate which has to be approached with care - otherwise a case of \"brave people challenging political correctness\" can unintentionally make hidden forms of white racism acceptable. Family and Kinship was hugely influential on perceptions of the East End working class. The reaction provoked by The New East End is that it could do likewise, particularly as it seemed to provide an explanation for the local election success of the BNP in Barking shortly after its publication; indeed Gavron believes that the arguments of the book have become \"commonplace\". Her critics fear that it hits two targets in one. It dangerously explains racism away by blaming welfare policy, and thus unintentionally both exonerates racism and undermines the importance of need in allocating welfare. Lifting the sociological fog This is how Michael Young began his London School of Economics PhD thesis, which he later, with Peter Willmott, turned into Family and Kinship in East London (right). It describes, on his first venture into the East End, a pea souper fog in Bethnal Green and how he had had to abandon the pre-war taxi he'd bought for \u00a340 and used as his private car. Asa Briggs, Young's biographer, said it was more like the start of a novel than a doctorate thesis. \"The fog became thicker as I crossed the canal from Bow and by the time I left the housing office I could not see on the ground ... I abandoned the old London taxi ... and that was when the enquiry began. Waiting until I heard some steps, I put my first question: I asked the way to the nearest Tube station. 'Search me, mate,' came back the voice, curiously loud in the fog. Then a woman spoke from nearer me. 'The Tube? Yes, dearie, you go straight on till you get to the traffic lights. You turn left and you'll see it right in front of you. What a game, eh?' With the help of other faceless friends, I felt my way, tapping my foot against the kerbstones as I went. I am still tapping. So I know when the enquiry began. What I am much less clear about is why. What brought me to the housing office? So far as I can remember, the point of departure for my journey into the fog was an interest in the social services, particularly in housing.\" Writ large: mixed memories of Family and Kinship David Kynaston Writer and historian I've had a three-stage relationship with Family and Kinship. At first, it seemed to explain everything: Britain in the 50s as a world of solid, rooted working-class communities before the great upheaval of slum clearance, comprehensive redevelopment, high-rise, mass immigration, social and geographic mobility, consumerism, de-industrialisation - and Thatcherism. Then, as I discovered that even in the 40s the British people were essentially individualistic in their instincts, the whole notion of \"community\" became questionable in my eyes, and I saw the book - perhaps harshly - as not only overly sentimental but also insufficiently aware of how the future lay with Debden, not Bethnal Green. Now, whatever the historical controversies, I feel that its ultimate value is literary: the finely textured observation of how extended families work, the range and intimacy of the voices, the humane and non-judgmental perspective of the authors. What a shame that British sociology, increasingly academic and theory-driven, subsequently lost the plot. \u00b7 David Kynaston's Austerity Britain 1945-51 is published by Bloomsbury on May 8 Rushanara Ali Associate director, Young Foundation I grew up in Bethnal Green in the 80s, and when I read the book for sociology A-level I remember thinking how its portrayal of the area seemed to me like a world apart. But later, when I was involved in researching its sequel, I was struck by how so many of the values that he identified in white working-class culture in the 50s exist today in the East End Bangladeshi community from which I come - the important role of women, of family network support systems, and community activism. As a work of sociology, Family and Kinship is not without its faults: the 50s East End was less monocultural than the book suggests. But it remains powerful, not least in the way it portrays working-class life with respect and affection. You don't see too much of that these days. Malcolm Dean Former Guardian leader writer on social affairs None of the housing policy planners in the 50s had understood the importance of kinship ties. Young and Willmott went out to a new suburban housing estate in Essex and heard predictable complaints about the lack of shops, pubs and a good bus service. Much more moving was the distress over the break-up of kinship ties and the feeling of geographical isolation. They established the important role that kinship ties - not just grandparents, but uncles, aunts, nephews, cousins - played in social life and the crucial support they provided at times of adversity. On the strung-out streets of the Essex estate, \"everyone was a stranger\". The book was immensely readable, and was intended to be. It was written to make sociology accessible to lay people. Jargon was banned. It is packed with vivid quotes and fascinating life stories. It won widespread applause in the serious press, although it put many academic noses out of joint. Laurie Taylor Writer and broadcaster A recent book on community studies announced authoritatively that Family and Kinship was the \"most widely read work of sociology in Britain\". I doubt it. In the early 60s it was certainly unusual to find a sociology essay in which it was not cited, but this was rarely an indication of close reading. Much more often it was a nod of approval towards a book that was crudely thought to contrast the wonders of working-class community with the horrors of suburban alienation. Willmott and Young were never so simple-minded, but the distorted version of what they wrote was deeply appealing to the lower middle-class students and lecturers who made up the sociology boom of the 60s. It was a way of assuaging their own guilt about the lives they had left behind as they took their own first steps up the meritocratic ladder. It also had considerable appeal to the vulgar Marxists of the time who were anxious to keep the working class exactly where it was so that it could come to perform its historic role, rather than lose its revolutionary impetus in the relatively green fields of Essex. \u00b7 Laurie Taylor discusses Family and Kinship in East London on Radio 4's Thinking Allowed at 4pm today. Tony Marchant Playwright I did read it years ago and while it did make an impression, it also made me feel a little uneasy. There was a lot of middle-class cultural tourism going back to Mayhew and Orwell, and even Somerset Maugham's Lisa of Lambeth, or Morrison's Child of the Jago, all \"down among the East End underclass\". I suppose they were the Guardian-reading liberal classes making a living out of us. The central theme was that the families shouldn't be broken up and packed off. Under the right-to-buy scheme, my family sold their council maisonette to City bankers and we moved to Chadwell Heath, but loads of families did the same and moved within a few doors of us; we surrounded ourselves with people we knew. The idea that we all hopped off to Essex, leaving our relations, isn't true. They came with us. Whenever I go back to the East End I realise the things that I missed are not there anymore. Lynsey Hanley Author Family and Kinship in East London remains powerful because so many of the conventions and structures of working-class life have remained intact, despite the terrible effects of displacement from the inner-city to peripheral estates that the book describes. I grew up on a council estate very much like the book's \"Greenleigh\" - actually, Debden in Essex - in which the female population, in particular, suffered dreadfully from loneliness and the weakening of social ties by splitting extended families and forcing them to rely on a tiny, hermetic nuclear unit. Reading much of it makes me wince in the knowledge that I further weakened the networks described by leaving home and not coming back after university: socially mobile daughters are not looked upon at all kindly by the East End families in the book and, despite 50 years of apparent social change, neither are they today. \u00b7 Lynsey Hanley's book, Estates: An Intimate History, is published by Granta. Toby Young Writer and journalist The main thesis for the book was contained in a paper my father, Michael Young, wrote for the Labour party Research Department in 1951, called For Richer, For Poorer. \"How extraordinary this is, such good stuff,\" wrote Edith Summerskill, the then minister of national insurance, who was one of the few people who bothered to read it. \"What on earth are you going to do with it? It's not right, is it, for the Labour party?\" The ideas contained in this paper represent the most sustained burst of intellectual creativity in Michael's career. He suffered from depression all his life and it was only when this began to lift that he was able to perceive colours again. It was during this period, in which the world suddenly took on a new vibrancy, that the ideas for Family and Kinship in East London began to tumble out of him. \u00b7 Family and Kinship in East London, by Peter Willmott and Michael Young, is published by Penguin, price \u00a39.99.
