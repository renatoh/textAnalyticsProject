Not as much as this one, it didn't. Leaving the cinema, women in the audience laughed and grinned and trilled a merry tune. I, on the other hand, attempted to leave and catch a bus home while remaining at all times hunched over with my legs tightly crossed. It is the debut feature from actor-turned-director Mitchell Lichtenstein, son of pop-art colossus Roy: a comedy-horror satire about the Christian right's chastity-abstinence cult. Jess Weixler gives a terrific performance as Dawn, the Joan of Arc of the True Love Waits circuit, giving inspirational campus speeches about the vital importance of the unpopped cherry. But Dawn has a secret: her vagina has two rows of fiendishly sharp teeth, which the various men who make attempts on Dawn's modesty discover to their considerable cost. Lichtenstein has cleverly created a knockabout comedy with touches of Russ Meyer, Gore Vidal and the Hammer horror movies. Importantly, it is all played absolutely straight, and Weixler resists any temptation to camp it up. Hidden socio-sexual meanings are there in plenty, but as Sigmund Freud might have said: sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and sometimes a hideously severed penis is just a hideously severed penis. Good clean fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
