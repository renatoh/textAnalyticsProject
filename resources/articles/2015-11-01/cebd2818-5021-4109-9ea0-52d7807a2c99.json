Legal experts, meanwhile, warn that many governors\u2019 positions exceed their state power. At least 25 states have expressed resistance to accepting Syrian refugees attempting to flee their country\u2019s civil war, and the list is rapidly expanding. Several governors are working to prevent refugee resettlement in their state directly, while other governors and several members of Congress are urging federal action. Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, was among the first to initiate the resistance campaign, suspending his state\u2019s Syrian refugee resettlement program. The move was an about-face for the governor, who had held out his state as a haven for resettling refugees, particularly those from Syria. The governor\u2019s spokeswoman, Sara Wurfel, said: \u201c[The] Governor is not saying we won\u2019t accept refugees \u2013 just suspending until complete review of clearance procedures is complete to ensure safety &amp; security.\u201d But Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders told a crowd at Cleveland State University on Monday the US must not \u201csuccumb to Islamophobia\u201d by turning its back on refugees fleeing the fighting in Syria. \u201cDuring these difficult times, we will not succumb to Islamophobia. We will not turn our backs on the refugees,\u201d he said. Rashida Tlaib, a former state representative and current manager of the Take on Hate campaign, said Snyder\u2019s suspension of the refugee program sent a perverse message, \u201cespecially because these are the same families that had the courage to stand up against these same attackers, against this sort of violence\u201d. \u201cWe in Michigan are at the forefront of making sure we\u2019re able to [resettle refugees and] at the same time making sure we\u2019re OK, making sure we\u2019re secure,\u201d Tlaib said. Dr Muzammil Ahmed, chairperson of the Michigan Muslim Community Council, said the group was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Snyder\u2019s \u201cvery knee-jerk\u201d decision. The governor has been \u201cgreat to work with, he has a very comprehensive vision when it comes to immigrants\u201d, Ahmed said. But, he added, the suspension of relocation efforts across the US will only fuel the narrative from Isis of \u201cus versus them\u201d. \u201cWe strongly oppose this narrative,\u201d Ahmed told the Guardian. \u201cWe feel one of the biggest victims of Isis is other Muslims. And the Syrian refugees are fleeing Isis and the terrorist activities that they have initiated. So I think that the governor\u2019s action just reinforced the narrative in people\u2019s mind that Isis wants to have.\u201d Snyder told reporters on Monday that he would not seek to stop the nearly two dozen Syrian refugees already en route to Michigan. By Monday, the list of states expressing hesitation about accepting Syrians had grown exponentially to include Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Florida, Ohio, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Maine, Wisconsin, Arizona and Indiana. Overnight, more than 30 states had taken a position. The chairman of the US House of Representatives homeland security committee, Michael McCaul, also called on Obama to suspend plans to admit Syrian refugees into the US. And Senator Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, introduced a bill to impose a moratorium on refugees from up to 30 countries with jihadist movements, including Syria. Governor Greg Abbott of Texas went so far as to say in a letter to President Obama: \u201cI write to inform you that the State of Texas will not accept any refugees from Syria in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack in Paris.\u201d Ian Millhiser, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, argued that Abbott has exceeded the limits of federal law, and cannot refuse to accept Syrian refugees. \u201cThe problem for Jindal, Abbott and the other governors opposed to admitting refugees \u2026 is that there is no lawful means that permits a state government to dictate immigration policy to the president in this way,\u201d he wrote for ThinkProgress. Abbott\u2019s letter to Obama also conflates Isis with Syrian refugees. He wrote: \u201cThe threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS. And in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists \u2013 including ISIS.\u201d Isis claimed responsibility for the Garland attack, but the two gunmen were not Syrians. They had been living in Phoenix, Arizona. One was born in Illinois and the other in Texas. As for the two Austin residents cited in Abbott\u2019s letter, one was a Houston native and the other a Bangladesh-born US citizen who was a student at the University of Texas. \u201cThis is all just a reaction out of fear as opposed to taking into account people\u2019s individual stories,\u201d said Mohammad Abdollahi, a spokesman for Raices, a Texas-based group that provides legal aid to refugees, including some Syrians. \u201c[Abbott] just fundamentally doesn\u2019t understand the issue of why they\u2019re fleeing violence.\u201d In Alabama, which has not accepted a Syrian refugee to date, the Republican governor, Robert Bentley, dug his feet in and said none will resettle there any time soon. \u201cAs your governor,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of Alabama in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Monsignor Michael Farmer, who heads a Catholic group called the Refugee Resettlement Program, seemed nonplussed by Bentley\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe word is out there, somehow, that we have Syrians coming here, and we don\u2019t,\u201d he said. But immigration is an ongoing, politically charged issue in Alabama, which in 2011 passed the nation\u2019s toughest immigration law, essentially driving undocumented immigrants from the state. On Monday, Sara\u00ed Portillo, executive director of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, warned against conflating a fear of terrorism with a general disapproval of immigrants. \u201cWe must be guided by our values and not our fear,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand offer refuge to innocent families in crisis. We should work towards an equal and fair treatment of all immigrants and refugees regardless of race, religion, national origin or sexual orientation.\u201d Not every US state sealed its borders on Monday. Governors in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Vermont said they would accept refugees. In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf\u2019s spokesperson told PennLive.com that, despite the attacks in Paris and Beirut, \u201cwe must not lose sight of the fact that families leaving Syria are trying to escape the same violence and unimaginable terror that took place in Paris and Beirut\u201d. The spokesperson added: \u201cPennsylvania will continue working with the federal government to ensure that all individuals have gone through the proper screening process.\u201d Observers in Michigan said the US has to play a role in addressing the influx of refugees streaming out of Syria \u2013 and that mechanisms already exist to ensure they are screened properly. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a knee-jerk reaction. The Department of Homeland Security already has matters in place to screen Syrian refugees \u2013 which include orphans \u2013 thus making Governor Snyder\u2019s point moot,\u201d said Dawud Walid, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations\u2019 Michigan chapter. Ahmed, of the Michigan Muslim Majority Council, said he understands the emotion behind Snyder\u2019s decision because \u201cwe certainly don\u2019t want to \u2026 have any high-risk individuals or extremists coming to our own country and creating turmoil here.\u201d But the US needs to play a major role in addressing the refugee crisis, he said. \u201cWe played a role in destabilizing the area,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWe need to do our fair share of taking care of the refugees we helped create.\u201d Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, backed the governors\u2019 concerns over security and said he favoured safe havens for people in their own countries. \u201cMy problem in the migrants situation is it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to accept migrants; it\u2019s that I\u2019m not not sure we can,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting in Washington. \u201cIn fact I\u2019m increasingly convinced we can\u2019t, at least at this stage in the process, because you cannot accurately do a background check on even 10,000 people.\u201d Rubio had previously indicated willingness to take in some Syrian refugees but his position hardened after the Paris attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can pick up the phone and call the Syrian government to find out who somebody is,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if the documents that people are bringing from abroad are reliable in terms of what they\u2019re saying; in fact often they\u2019re easily forged. It is not easy to conduct a background check on someone that\u2019s coming from that part of the world. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem. You allow 10,000 people in; 9,999 of them are innocent people fleeing oppression and one of them is a well trained Isis fighter \u2013 you\u2019ve got a huge problem on your hands. That\u2019s the problem that we have with this programme. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to do it, and it\u2019s not that we as a nation\u2019s heart doesn\u2019t break but, by the same token, what if we get one of them wrong? The consequences can be extraordinary.\u201d The Florida senator added: \u201cThat\u2019s why I think a better approach is to create these [safe] havens within the Middle East where some of these ancient communities that have been present in the region for over 2,000 years are being driven from their ancestral homelands. It would be much better to leave them in the region in safety than drive hundreds of thousands of people permanently away from the region of the world where they have links that go back millennia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
