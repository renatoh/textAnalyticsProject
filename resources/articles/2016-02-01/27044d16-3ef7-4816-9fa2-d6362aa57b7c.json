Having seen them humble the former title favourites, I\u2019m expecting an entirely different proposition to the team that we turned over 5-2 at the King Power back in September. As ever, the outcome will depend on which incarnation of the Gunners turns up. We badly need the likes of Alexis and Giroud to rediscover their mojo, so that, in tandem with the magical promptings of Mesut \u00d6zil, we\u2019ll have the firepower to trouble Schmeichel. The big question is whether we can match the visitors\u2019 zest and intensity in the middle of the park, to prevent the likes of Kant\u00e9 and Drinkwater running amok. Ultimately it might prove a tale of the two keepers and whether Petr Cech can outshine his opposite number. Will your team win the title \u2026? Obviously my heart says yes ... Fitness permitting, we have the talent to go all the way, but sadly we\u2019ve yet to witness proof of the side having the necessary appetite. The taxing nature of a title race puts the emphasis on the whole being greater than the sum of the individual parts. With Aaron Ramsey inheriting the injured Santi Cazorla\u2019s much coveted central role and the Ox finally liberated from the shackles of his sideline yoke, their seemingly blase body language leaves us increasingly frustrated that the same level of intense desire on the terraces is not made manifest on the pitch. To date that \u2018I want a winner\u2019s medal and nothing is going to stop me\u2019 type of total commitment has been demonstrated almost exclusively by Alexis, while the majority of his team-mates appear to expect it to be handed to them, gift-wrapped (leaving some of our star names open to accusations of merely going through the motions, keeping their powder dry for the Euros this summer). If the Gunners are to scale the summit and remain there, we have to hope our Chilean Duracell Bunny is infectious and that they all catch this same vibe \u2026 sharpish! \u2026 but if you don\u2019t, who will? Anyone but Spurs \u2026 It\u2019d be most amusing to see the Tinkerman making a mockery of the traditional hierarchy. Which three other remaining fixtures most worry you? The outing to Goodison is a potential banana skin, immediately after our return from conquering Messi. Then there\u2019s the minor matter of winning the title at the Etihad on the penultimate weekend. Best moment of the season so far? Blowing Manchester United away in the opening 20 mins, though that\u2019s been undermined a bit by their mediocrity since. There\u2019s also Flamini silencing White Hart Lane with his stunning brace in the League Cup, and Giroud reviving our European adventure. Who has been the key player? Mesut \u00d6zil is, as they say, worth the price of admission alone, but Petr Cech has proved key: he has earned the points that would\u2019ve previously been squandered. Most underrated hero? Never thought I\u2019d be glad to see Gibbs on the bench, but Nacho Monreal has been the epitome of consistency so far. And finally, your side\u2019s best XI With Jack Wilshere the forgotten man, our best XI pretty much picks itself. The only real debate is Gabriel or the BFG \u2013 but Per seems sufficiently composed, when afforded Franny\u2019s protection: Cech, Beller\u00edn, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal, Ramsey, Coquelin, Cazorla, S\u00e1nchez, \u00d6zil, Giroud. Bernard Azulay, @GoonerN5, goonersdiary.co.uk LEICESTER CITY Prediction for today\u2019s game? This is tricky. I know now, like neutrals do, that we are the real deal. But then so are Arsenal. It would be nice to pick up another three points away to a title rival but I would definitely settle for one. 1-1. Will your team win the title \u2026? All the omens are there aren\u2019t they? The statistics say we will, the history book says we will, my heart says we will. My anxious brain, however, does not. We\u2019re the biggest bridesmaids in English football, having come as close as you can to the top-tier title and the FA Cup without winning either, and Ranieri is the equivalent in management. I pray, by way of a beautiful footballing miracle, that the nearly club and the nearly man will stick to the script and lift the trophy in May. \u2026 but if you don\u2019t, who will? Currently I\u2019m more worried about Spurs than anybody else. Arsenal are inconsistent and Man City have a lot of competitions to manage, and plenty of distractions with their impending change of management. Like us, Spurs are without pressure in the final furlong - both of us are comfortably on course to exceed our pre-season targets, whereas the other two challengers are underachieving. Which three other remaining fixtures most worry you? Honestly, I don\u2019t fear playing Man Utd, Chelsea or even Arsenal \u2013 this squad relishes the big occasion. However, our most recent poor results have come against sides like Bournemouth and Aston Villa, teams we should be beating. We have to pick up the points in games where teams come to defend, and unfortunately as the season draws to an end, the sides at the bottom will be more determined than ever to take points away from us. With that in mind, I\u2019m dreading Swansea, Newcastle and Norwich visiting Filbert Way. Best moment of the season so far? I had to discuss this with other Foxes fans because the list of contenders is virtually endless. Vardy\u2019s record-breaking goal against Man Utd would take the crown had the subsequent result, a 1-1 draw, not been one of the worst of our season. And, had you asked me 10 days ago, I probably would have chosen Vardy\u2019s audacious half-volley against Liverpool. But now I would say last week\u2019s 3-1 win at Manchester City was our best moment. We\u2019ve really set the league alight this year but going toe-to-toe with a multimillion pound squad and comfortably beating them on their own patch, leading to scenes of pure, unadulterated joy in the away end, it was the stuff of dreams for Leicester fans. Who has been the key player? For all the talk of Jamie Vardy\u2019s goals and Riyad Mahrez\u2019s wizardry, I still think our best player is N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. His work-rate and almost inhuman ability to intercept and break-up almost any attack has been the crux of our counterattacking success this term. I can see Mahrez and Vardy taking much of the acclaim nationwide but I think closer to the club, the 5ft 6in Kant\u00e9 is regarded as the biggest of the three stand-out heroes. Most underrated hero? Christian Fuchs: a free from Schalke last summer: sturdy, creative, and, if that wasn\u2019t enough, his fun-to-say surname is also German for fox. And finally, your side\u2019s best XI Schmeichel, Simpson, Huth, Morgan, Fuchs, Mahrez, Kante, Drinkwater, Albrighton, Vardy, Okazaki Chris Whiting, @ChrisRWhiting MANCHESTER CITY Prediction for today\u2019s game? I\u2019m not confident, and for good reason. We haven\u2019t beaten a team above eighth place this season \u2013 which is a truly staggering statistic. Teams like Spurs are our kryptonite. We really struggle against well-drilled sides that press us, as shown by the Leicester performance last weekend. If Kompany is indeed fit again, I\u2019m a little more optimistic. But Spurs have really, really impressed me this season. Mauricio Pochettino is doing a fantastic job. Man City 1 Tottenham 2. Will you win the title \u2026? No. There\u2019s still a small part of me that\u2019s hoping that it will all click into place wonderfully, but the signs just aren\u2019t there. We\u2019ve been terribly inconsistent all season long and now given the swathe of injuries, I\u2019m not sure we have it in us. Admittedly, we do have Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who continues to amaze and delight me in equal measure. The prospect of him playing under Pep Guardiola next season is mouth-watering. But as for our title chances, I can\u2019t see it. If we do win it, we will do so having stumbled over the line like a drunk. \u2026 but if you don\u2019t, who will? I genuinely don\u2019t know. But it would be brilliant if Leicester did it. Above all, I\u2019ve just really enjoyed watching them play football this season. Which three other remaining fixtures most worry you? Liverpool in the Capital One Cup final, Liverpool away and Arsenal at home. Liverpool worry me for the same reasons as Spurs \u2013 they press relentlessly against good sides. It\u2019s also worth remembering that they absolutely hammered us at the Etihad. The Arsenal game worries me purely because it\u2019s so late in the season. If we are still in the title race, that game will undoubtedly be pivotal. Best moment of the season so far? I really enjoyed the 3-0 against Chelsea. It was one of the most balanced, all-round performances I\u2019ve seen from a City team under Manuel Pellegrini. It also signalled a departure away from the one-paced, stale football that we had become accustomed to, in favour of a more direct style. Thanks in part to the signings of Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne. Who has been the key player? Fernandinho. He has always done the work of two men in our midfield, plugging the gaps vacated by Tour\u00e9. But in light of Yaya\u2019s decline, his importance has become even more pronounced. He\u2019s brilliant at making interceptions, has an unbelievable engine and is technically superb. Guardiola will absolutely love him. Most underrated hero? Joe Hart. He was so overrated initially, that he\u2019s now underrated. He continues to make ridiculous saves \u2013 Payet against West Ham. But most impressive of all is that he has really improved as a goalkeeper over the last 18 months or so. He\u2019s one of England\u2019s gems. And finally, your side\u2019s best XI Hart; Sagna, Kompany, Otamendi, Clichy; Fernandinho, Toure; De Bruyne, Silva, Sterling; Aguero Lloyd Scragg, @lloyd_scragg mcfcwatch.com TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR Prediction for today\u2019s game? In recent years Man City have scored with contemptuous ease, including five at White Hart Lane and six at the Etihad. But this season has already seen an end to our defensive sloppiness. Sergio Ag\u00fcero, probably not 100% fit, was well marshalled in our 4-1 home win in September and it was City\u2019s defence that was shambolic for a change. We have lost once away all season, when we scored Man United\u2019s goal for them, so we shouldn\u2019t fear a trip anywhere. I\u2019ll take a stab at Spurs to win 2-1, assuming one goal for Ag\u00fcero who will then be let down by their dodgy defence, twice. Will you win the title \u2026? I\u2019m not convinced about our title chances. We are in a good position, with the best goal difference, but, of the current top four, we have won the fewest games. We have only just, since last weekend, got to the position where we have won more than half our games. \u2026 but if you don\u2019t, who will? So, looking at the other three teams in the top four, the title is Leicester\u2019s to lose. Vincent Kompany-less City can\u2019t defend, losing Kevin De Bruyne doesn\u2019t help and the managerial hoo-ha could be unsettling. They also might be focused too much on the Champions League. Arsenal have three tricky away fixtures at Spurs, Man Utd and Man City. Which leaves Leicester. Champions usually either win the most games or lose the fewest; Leicester are currently ahead on both criteria. And, remember, they finished the season rather strongly too. Which three other remaining fixtures most worry you? Manchester United at home, a side we haven\u2019t beaten since May 2001. Then there\u2019s Chelsea away and I bet half our team weren\u2019t even born when we last won there in the league. I would like the third to be at Newcastle on the final day- the worry stemming from the tension of needing a favourable result there to win the title. Best moment of the season so far? Dele Alli\u2019s goal at Selhurst Park. Not only was it a beautiful goal but, late on in a tight game, it won us the match. A Spurs friend, sitting five rows behind, managed to kiss me in the ensuing pandemonium. I\u2019m very worried for my virtue if we do win the title. Who has been the key player? Dele Alli. Although Alderweireld and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 have been brilliant, Alli gives us the threat. He has movement, pace, skill and invention and seems to add a fluency throughout the whole side. He played the first half at Norwich where we were superb; but when he didn\u2019t come out for the second half, we laboured a bit. It was the other way round against Watford. On the bench for the scoreless first half, as soon as he came on in the second, he provided the pass for our only goal. Most underrated hero? Eric Dier. Hats off to Pochettino for spotting that he had a defensive midfield player in him. I was critical in the summer that we hadn\u2019t bought to strengthen that part of the team but Dier has been just what we needed. His positioning and intelligent reading of the game have been the heartbeat of the team. And finally, your side\u2019s best XI Lloris, Walker, Alderweireld, Vertongen, Rose, Alli, Dembele, Dier, Eriksen, Son, Kane. But that could be considered harsh on Lamela, Trippier and Davies. Not easy, this management lark. Dave Mason, Observer reader"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
