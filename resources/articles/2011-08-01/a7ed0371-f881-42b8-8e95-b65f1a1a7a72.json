The victories are met with a thin smile at best. When Manchester United beat Barcelona at the weekend no one supposed the hierarchy had been reversed since the Champions League final between them at Wembley on 28 May. Most people will have reflected that the start of La Liga season comes a fortnight after the opening of the Premier League campaign. Nothing much mattered at all at the weekend, or not, at least, until the conclusion of the Emirates Cup. Arsenal came in for some booing after the trophy went to New York Red Bulls. It was as if there had never been a summer break. The continuity was bleakly impeccable. The closing home match of the Premier League campaign had also seen them berated by their fans. A failure against Aston Villa at home condemned them to fourth place in the table and a berth in the qualifiers for the Champions League. Manchester City had vaulted over Arsenal that afternoon. Even if Roberto Mancini's spending were to taper off, with the purchase of Sergio Ag\u00fcero balanced to a considerable degree by the potential sale of Carlos Tevez, the possible impact of his squad is obvious. With Manchester United restructuring from a position of strength, Chelsea still solid even before we discover the long\u2011term intentions of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and Liverpool zealous in redeveloping their side, Arsenal face a struggle simply to stand still. There was anger in May at the club suffering its worst home record in the League for 14 years. That, however, was an academic issue compared with the dread of further deterioration. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is in credit with the public at large for the sleek and entertaining play of his better line-ups but fans cannot nourish themselves so easily on memories now that they have been starved of a trophy for six years. It is galling to the average supporter that Arsenal appeared to be perfecting the spectacular mishap. If supporters reeled last season at the 4\u20114 draw away to Newcastle United after a 4\u20110 lead had been established in the 26th minute, the deeper pain probably lay elsewhere. In November they led 2-0 at the Emirates before losing 3-2 to Tottenham Hotspur in the League. At White Hart Lane a 3-1 lead paved the way to no more than a draw for Arsenal. The syndrome is well known but that does not mean it has been addressed. Wenger most likely happened to buy a forward as his first major acquisition of the summer because there was a deal to be done with Lille. Gervinho looks an asset already, with his ability to attack from a range of positions, but scoring has seldom been a concern to Arsenal. Defending and checking the opposition in midfield have been far greater worries. It will be a relief if Thomas Vermaelen can be a constant presence, after achilles trouble restricted him to five appearances last season. The real issues, for Arsenal, have not lain in the fortunes of any one player. Indeed a bid for the title was sustained for many months. The greater worry lay in the disintegration that saw them take full points from only one of their last seven matches. The exception would have been as maddening as it was gladdening. United, the prospective champions, were beaten. Arsenal see constantly that there need be little if any difference between themselves and the inveterate trophy-winners of recent years such as United and Chelsea. There are areas of uncertainty. Wojciech Szczesny is a mere 21\u2011year\u2011old but, then again, he does not have the experience of Manchester United's David de Gea, although the latter is younger still. Other issues have still to be addressed. Samir Nasri's intentions are yet to be established as he enters the last season of his contract. At a grander level still can a satisfactory fee be obtained from Barcelona for Cesc F\u00e1bregas? If so, will Wenger have enough time left to put that money to use? Arsenal, by and large, should be well-placed. Despite the downturn in the economy, there has been some progress in the property development around their old ground. On the football scene, however, the environment is testing. Moods have shifted as well. Supporters no longer speak as if they are blessed to be in the presence of Wenger's team. The League Cup might not count for much in the eyes of such a club but losing the final to a Birmingham City side who went on to be relegated was profoundly troubling. While the wining goal should have been avoided, the needlessness of the defeat felt characteristic. Wenger, who has remade Arsenal so gloriously, must fashion a team who can lift trophies as well as win the admiration of purists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
