The trio were taken to court by Cuadrilla, which last year became the first firm to start large-scale fracking in Britain. The energy firm said it took legal action to prevent \u201cdangerous, disrespectful and illegal activity\u201d at its Preston New Road site near Blackpool. Katrina Lawrie, Lee Walsh and Christopher Wilson were found in contempt of court at Manchester high court on Friday after taking part in a \u201clock-on\u201d at the site on 24 July last year. It took police six and a half hours to separate the protesters as they sat locked together at the entrance to the site. Lawrie was found to have breached the injunction on one further occasion, in August last year. The lock-on came less than a fortnight after a judge granted an injunction preventing \u201cpersons unknown\u201d from trespassing on the shale gas exploration site and surrounding farmland, as well as prohibiting unlawful obstruction of the site entrance and adjacent main A583 road. The judge, Mark Pelling QC, told the group they would not face jail but might receive a suspended sentence or fine at a further hearing in September. \u201cThere can be no doubt that the respondents breached the injunction. It is beyond reasonable doubt that they intended to slow or stop the traffic,\u201d said Pelling, who granted the original Cuadrilla injunction last year. He adjourned sentencing for the three protesters and the environmental group Friends of the Earth to seek a variation of the terms of the injunction. They argue it is strikingly similar to a \u201cdraconian and anti-democratic\u201d injunction taken out by Ineos, one of Cuadrilla\u2019s rivals, which was subsequently overruled by judges as it was found to be \u201ctoo wide and insufficiently clear\u201d. \u201cInjunctions such as this have a chilling effect on the right to peaceful protest. Britain has a proud history of protest. It forms the essence of civic society. From the actions of the suffragettes to the \u2018Blackpool Two\u2019, civil disobedience has long been exercised as a form of legitimate protest,\u201d said Simon Pook of Robert Lizar solicitors, representing the protesters. This is the first time anti-fracking campaigners have been brought to court for breaching the terms of an injunction. It is also thought to be the first time a company has attempted to bring proceedings against protesters for alleged breaches of a \u201cpersons unknown\u201d injunction, according to the news website Drill or Drop. In a statement, Francis Egan, the chief executive of Cuadrilla, said: \u201cWe respect the right to legal and peaceful protest but too often we have seen the opposite with dangerous, disrespectful and illegal activity around our shale gas exploration site in Preston New Road. Local people, our staff and contractors have rights too and they must be equally protected. \u201cWhat we are hearing, on a day-to-day basis from our local communities, is that the disruptive activities of a small group of activists is their main problem. Not Cuadrilla. Not the exaggerated claims about micro seismicity which causes no more vibration than that experienced everyday by standing by a busy road and not the hydraulic fracture process itself, which the wide-ranging and comprehensive regulatory monitoring of our operations has proven to be safe. \u201cThe court heard how the defendants acted in ways that were dangerous and designed to cause maximum disruption to people who daily use Preston New Road to go to and from work or drop their children at school. The defendants wrongly believed that their illegal protest should be allowed to interfere with and supersede everyone else\u2019s right to work, travel or go about their day-to-day business.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 July 2019 to remove a reference to Drill or Drop as an \u201canti-fracking website\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
