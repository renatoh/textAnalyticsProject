He is also expected to make a renewed attempt to persuade the crisis-hit probation service to back his controversial public sector reform programme. The move comes in response to a series of high-profile probation failures in which serious offenders released from prison have struck again. \"He will not be reading the riot act or berating the probation service,\" said a Home Office source. \"He wants to work with the probation service. The question is how we support them better.\" Yesterday Mr Clarke unveiled an emergency package to restore public faith in the service and said he was confident probation staff were willing to embrace reform in the wake of the scandals, including the murder of city financier John Monckton. \"Being a probation officer is a tough job. You have to make tough calls, tough decisions which can be wrong,\" he said when he announced the introduction of a violent offenders' order that will mean more supervision for offenders who have been released from prison until the formal end of their sentences. The official inquiry report into the murder of Mr Monckton found \"collective failures\" by the London probation service in a case where the killer had been released from prison with an official assessment report that there was a 91% chance that he would strike again. Mr Clarke said he recognised that restoring public confidence in the system was his \"single most difficult and important task\" as home secretary. \"These are difficult and dangerous people. This is not an easy task,\" he said. The home secretary has been frustrated in his idea of making the new indeterminate sentence - under which offenders are not released from prison if they still represent a risk to the public - retrospective so that it applies to those jailed before its introduction in April 2005. He acknowledged that parliament would not accept such retrospective legislation. Instead, he hopes to introduce legislation for the violent offenders' orders, though many of the details still have to be thrashed out. Home Office lawyers have told him the orders cannot be made by the criminal courts as the released prisoners would be able to legally challenge them on the grounds that they were being sentenced twice for the same offence. They will have to be civil orders, similar to antisocial behaviour orders, which will limit the conditions they can place on those released from prison. For example, curfews, electronic tags and enforced weekly reporting to the police are not possible under a civil order. They will, however, be able to insist the offender does not go to specific places or visit specific people. The home secretary said he would also ensure that offenders sentenced before the new indeterminate sentence was introduced in April 2005 would remain on licence right up to the end of their original sentence rather than the three-quarter point as now. \"This will mean that offenders who give cause for concern at any time during the currency of their sentence can be recalled to prison,\" he said. He added that breaches of the new orders could lead to a recall to prison for up to five years. The orders could last a minimum of 10 years. The announcement was made on the same day as a man was given an indeterminate sentence, with no release date set, after repeatedly raping a nine-year-old girl. Kevin Hazelwood, 40, was already on the sex offenders' register for downloading child pornography. More than 400 indeterminate sentences are believed to have been passed since their introduction last April. Harry Fletcher, of Napo, the probation officers' union, said there were 40,000 higher-risk offenders who could potentially become liable for the new violent offenders' orders. He said it was essential ministers stopped blaming an under-resourced probation service when release decisions went wrong. The new orders were given a cautious welcome by the probation boards' association, the employers' organisation. But the association added in a statement: \"If no extra resources are forthcoming, officers will be taken away from other duties.\" Killers and rapists who attacked while on probation 1: Kevin Hazelwood: Jailed indefinitely at Lewes crown court yesterday for raping a nine-year-old girl while on a sex offender treatment programme for offences involving downloading child pornography. 2: Crack addict Yusuf Bouhaddaou, 28, murdered Robert Symons, 45, five weeks after being released on parole to supervision of London probation service. 3: Damien Hanson , 24, murdered John Monckton, 49, in 2004, three months after serving seven years of a 12-year sentence. Inquiry found \"collective failure\" by the London probation service. His accomplice, Elliot White was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter. 4: Peter Williams, 19, a robber, murdered Marian Bates , 64, a jeweller, in Nottingham in November 2003, while electronically tagged. He had also missed appointments with his probation officer and police. 5: A gang of men, four of whom were on probation supervision at the time raped, tortured and stabbed Mary-Ann Leneghan. They subjected her 18-year-old friend to the same ordeal before shooting her in the head, but she survived and later gave evidence against them. The gang leader, Adrian Thomas, a drug dealer, was on a community rehabilitation order for drug offences. The most violent member of the gang, Michael Johnson, had a criminal career starting when he was 13, including a conviction for hanging a teenage boy with learning difficulties upside-down from a tree. Others convicted are Indirit Krasniqi and Jamaile Morally. The prosecution said that the men had targeted the young women as revenge because Thomas believed they had set him up to be robbed the previous month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
