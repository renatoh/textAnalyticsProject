All the more so for a city still linked in the populist imagination with car thieves, political chicanery and the music of the Fab Four. Despite the cynicism about \"BoHo\" Britain and questions over the real value cultural renewal can make to urban regeneration, the title will undoubtedly boost civic pride, generate tourism and hopefully attract much needed private investment (especially if they can sort out some direct flights from London). The competitive process for the Capital of Culture prize has more generally refocused attention on the resurgent cities of Britain's old, industrial heartland. With the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Arts and signs of economic renewal in Gateshead, the new post-G8 mood in the feverishly redesigned Birmingham and the continuing revival of Manchester, it appears the world's first modern cities are at last regaining their cultural and civic confidence. But these cities hold nowhere near the status they once held within Britain, let alone the world. For while many are growing on the back of a heritage and arts public-private boom, they still lack the vital economic muscle and political power that remains essential to any city's long-term standing. As part of its 250th anniversary, the British Museum is hosting a wonderful exhibition, entitled London 1753. Amid the displays of Hogarth prints, maps of the village communities that made up the capital and accounts of the rookeries and gin alleys of the notorious St Giles's district, there comes across the sense of the unrivalled importance of 18th century London. It was 20 times larger than any other English city, housing 11% of the nation's population, and in all matters from architecture to literature, fashion to politics, business to religion it led the country. A position in London was absolutely essential for anyone with serious ambition. As the British empire expanded out of the counting houses and government offices, and as the Georgian re-modelling of the Augustan capital began, London's dominance over the nation was total. One of the most intriguing aspects of the 19th century was the assault on this urban hyper-power and shift from London to the provinces. Certainly, London could still beat its regional competitors per head of population, but over the course of the century it lost its political and economic hegemony. The wealth of Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, and Birmingham - not to mention Glasgow, Bradford, Newcastle, and Sheffield - moved the dynamic out from the south east. The cotton lords of Manchester, the great merchants of Liverpool, and the engineering magnates of Glasgow no longer looked instinctively to London for culture, politics or fashion. Instead, Victorian cities began to celebrate their own civic ethos and urban identity. It was the philosophy of the \"Manchester School\" that committed Britain to free trade. It was Liverpool Toryism that produced the Gladstone dynasty. And it was Birmingham and Glasgow that began the traditions of municipal socialism long before the London county council was even established. Yet all of this was dependent upon an autonomous economic base and a degree of political self-government, which encouraged the best and brightest into municipal service. Successful businessmen and professionals were affixed to their cities by strong economic ties. Increasingly, this diffuse urban base - with London sharing its sovereignty with a series of regional powers - became a part of the British identity. Celebrating the hosting of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science congress in Birmingham in 1857, the Birmingham Daily Press eulogised the importance of England's provincial capitals. \"On the other side of the Channel Paris is France, but no such rule applies with us.\" In Britain, \"Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, and other towns must be asked their opinion\" before any great decisions are taken. The British were a free, civic people with a network of powerful cities, while France was governed slavishly by its capital, Paris. What a difference a century makes. For the reversal in fortunes enjoyed by French and British cities over the 20th century could hardly have been more graphic. While Lyon, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and every other regional French capital garnered significant powers, the British cities have been gutted of authority. On this side of the Channel, the 20th century initiated a sustained programme of economic and political centralisation that fatally undermined the old industrial powerbases. Meanwhile, continental Europe (and most especially post-Fascist countries whose constitutions dictated a high degree of regional autonomy) has decentralised power to its cities. The point about Bilbao, Barcelona, Madrid and all the other centres our civic leaders look enviously toward is that each one retains a strong element of civic autonomy. In addition, Britain's urban political life has not been helped by economic globalisation. The strong local economies and businesses that traditionally provided a source of high calibre municipal politicians have been replaced by companies with greatly diminished loyalty to their cities or regions. And so in Britain we have returned to 1753. London with its 10 million inhabitants, and plans for a further 700,000, bestrides England with the same arrogance as its 18th century forebear. With our national economy geared ever more towards tourism, finance, leisure and services, and our Westminster Parliament still showing few signs of shedding its authority, the capital looks set to retain that hold long into the future - with the scary thought of Ken Livingstone as our Prince Regent. Thus the real battle now engaging national policy makers is not over the Capital of Culture, but the fight to host the Olympics. Cities are now engaged in a global process of competitive rivalry and emulation. And in that game, 250 years on, London is sadly still our only real player."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
