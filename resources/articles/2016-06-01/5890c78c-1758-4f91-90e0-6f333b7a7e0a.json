Police sources quoted in Turkish media said that the attackers were likely affiliated with the Islamic State terror group. Turkish security forces have recently carried out numerous arrests and raids on the group in the country and at its borders, leading some analysts to speculate that Isis might carry out more retaliatory attacks. But Istanbul has been on a high security alert for months after three deadly attacks in the city this year blamed on Islamic State jihadis and the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK), a radical offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). Less than a month ago a car suicide bomber killed 12 people and wounded several others in the central Istanbul district of Vezneciler. TAK claimed responsibility for the attack, warning foreign tourists on their website that \u201cTurkey was no longer safe for them.\u201d The group, an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), said that the bombing came in retaliation for ongoing security operations in the predominantly Kurdish south-east, and threatened that attacks would continue. Tak had previously claimed responsibility for two separate suicide car bombings in Ankara in April that killed 29 people. The deadliest terrorist attack on Turkish soil remains a twin suicide bombing in Ankara last October which targeted a peace rally organised by Kurdish and leftist groups and killed 103 people. An additional 250 were injured in the attack which stunned the nation. No organisation ever claimed responsibility, but investigators identified the bomber as an Islamist militant whose brother had carried out a previous suicide attack. As with the attack at Istanbul airport, Turkish authorities blamed Isis for the bombing; many ordinary Turks are both worried and angry that the war at the country\u2019s border appears to be spreading within Turkey. Meanwhile, violence between the PKK and the Turkish government has soared up after the breakdown of a mutual ceasefire between the two foes last year, and hundreds of people were killed in violent clashes between security forces and Kurdish militants in cities and towns across the predominantly Kurdish south-east. Some people have expressed their anger with the current state of security in the country. Successive suicide bomb attacks have also had a disastrous effect on tourism \u2013 a major driver of the country\u2019s economy. \u201cThe people were scared that a bomb would explode in a crowded place. [The Turkish intelligence agency] MIT doesn\u2019t seem to care about us, they were not even as worried as the people were,\u201d Seda \u00d6zen tweeted. \u201cFor the first time in years \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, Ey\u00fcp, S\u00fcleymaniye and Sultanahmet were empty during the month of Ramadan. People didn\u2019t even go to the mosque.\u201d Others were quick to point an angry finger at perceived outside forces trying to hurt Turkey. The hashtag #TurkeyWillNotSurrender trended just below #TheGovernment ShouldResign. \u201cTurkey is a big Muslim country. Our enemies don\u2019t want tourists come to Turkey. It\u2019s time to be together,\u201d wrote one Twitter user, Tevfik Okutan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
