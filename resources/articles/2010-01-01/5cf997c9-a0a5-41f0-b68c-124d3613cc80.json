In the sectarian blocs that had consolidated since the 1880s home-rule crisis, and were embedded in the two states established after the last major round of Irish \"troubles\" \u2013 a blind eye being turned in London to developments in Belfast \u2013 the politics of patronage displaced the modernisation associated more widely across western Europe with the expansion of the franchise, expressed in the definition of politics along left-right lines. When devolution was renewed in 2007, the son of the first minister, Ian Paisley, who walked past Craig's statue in the grand building celebrating Protestant communal power at Stormont, was embroiled in a row over his relationship with Seymour Sweeney, a developer and member of Paisley's Democratic Unionist party. Paisley Jr couldn't see what was wrong with lobbying on Sweeney's behalf while a junior minister. Nor, evidently, did Peter Robinson, Paisley Sr's successor as first minister and DUP leader, see anything amiss when it emerged during the Westminster expenses scandal that he and his wife, Iris, employed their three children and a daughter-in-law, accruing about half a million pounds in salaries and expenses from parliament and the Northern Ireland assembly \u2013 leading to the cutting Daily Mail headline: \"The swish family Robinson\". Nor did Iris Robinson see anything awry in \u2013 according to a BBC investigation \u2013 accepting donations totalling \u00a350,000 from developer contacts. This money was transferred to her teenage lover to assist a business venture, and she failed to declare an interest when a relevant planning decision came up at the district council in the environs of east Belfast dominated by the Robinsons for decades. The salacious aspect of the affair has captured media attention. But the real story is that the Northern Ireland of 2010 should so resemble the Northern Ireland of decades earlier \u2013 hence the depth of the crisis that now looms. It became an abiding conceit of the peace process that previous efforts to tackle sectarianism, focusing on the more moderate communal and non-sectarian parties, should be replaced by an approach indulging their more militantly ethnic, even paramilitary, rivals. This joint London-Dublin approach replaced the politics of accommodation with the politics of polarisation. The institutions arising from the Belfast agreement of 1998 thus had a fitful life until their collapse in 2002; and their restoration in 2007 has seen tightening deadlock. The evangelical-Protestant culture of DUP members makes them incapable of empathy with their Catholic counterparts, while the secular-Leninist Sinn F\u00e9in variant makes that party immune to the trauma the IRA campaign inflicted, particularly on Protestant members of the \"security forces\". The antagonism has focused on those issues defining the ethno-national character of the state: provision for the Irish language, the future of the Maze site, and, above all, the devolution of policing and justice. Repeated blocking of Sinn F\u00e9in demands has led the party to consider collapsing the institutions again, and it is unlikely to allow the six weeks of Robinson's absence from the post of first minister, announced today \u2013 while he ostensibly seeks to clear his name \u2013 to elapse before provoking a further, possibly terminal, crisis. All this should have been evident to the UK and Irish governments for a long time. But something else that doesn't change much in Northern Ireland is the view that it's all the fault of the irrational Irish \u2013 and so leave it to them to sort it out. The danger now is that the unfolding crisis leads to emergency assembly elections, with a big vote for the even more fundamentalist Traditional Unionist Voice, no new shared government at Stormont \u2013 and a growing drumbeat of \"dissident\" republican violence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
