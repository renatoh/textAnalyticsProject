It is half a century more since Wales have beaten the All Blacks. But Italy\u2019s captain Sergio Parisse, for one, believes Warren Gatland\u2019s side can catch the world champions cold when they play three Tests in New Zealand in June. For Wales this rout of Italy, their biggest win in a Six Nations, may have been scant consolation after they failed to find second gear for an hour at Twickenham. But the great No8, after winning a record 119th cap in miserable circumstances, said: \u201cIt will be difficult for Wales but they will be representing the northern hemisphere and so I want them to do well and think they will. Wales have the quality and the weapons to put the All Blacks under pressure.\u201d The Wales squad had had a day at Cheltenham during the week and the form horses at the start of the championship navigated this final hurdle at a canter. Second place in the championship, though, is not good enough for Gatland, the leading candidate to coach the Lions in New Zealand next year. There was a strange atmosphere after the game when it was difficult to detect from the demeanour of the coaches whose team had racked up the most points ever in a championship game and whose side had just conceded nine tries in a game for the second time in a week and been whitewashed. Jacques Brunel, Italy\u2019s coach, looked like a man from whose shoulders a very large boulder had been lifted. After four years in which Italy have been going mostly backwards the Frenchman is returning home to help coach Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles. Gatland, though, was testy over how he perceives his remarks about Joe Marler\u2019s shameful words to Samson Lee had been reported and how he had been drawn into the debate over Italy\u2019s inclusion in the Six Nations. The Wales head coach refused to discuss Italy\u2019s place at the top table but said he was relishing the prospect of the All Black Tests which fall after another meeting with England at Twickenham at the end of May. And he hit back at critics of his wing George North, whose fourth try in four successive matches was his most spectacular. \u201cGeorge is starting to play with a smile on his face and is getting back to where he was in 2013. We can build on that in New Zealand,\u201d he said. The Northampton wing\u2019s career has been interrupted by last season\u2019s blows to the head, which included being knocked unconscious in an accidental clash with the Wales hooker Richard Hibbard in another defeat by England. There was another worrying incident here when the flanker Justin Tipuric was taken off the field after landing on his head after being sent crashing from a lineout. Tipuric, only in the side because his captain Sam Warburton was concussed at Twickenham, spent Saturday night under observation in hospital. His 15th-minute replacement, Gloucester\u2019s Ross Moriarty, took full advantage with an impressive 65 minutes that featured two tries. It cast a bit of a shadow over an otherwise ruthless demolition of a team who are expected to be taken over by the Harlequins director of rugby, Conor O\u2019Shea, who might need to remind himself in the coming months that Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.
