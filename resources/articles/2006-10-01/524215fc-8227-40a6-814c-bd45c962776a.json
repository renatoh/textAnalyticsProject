The remarks by Tarique Ghaffur, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan police, follow a storm of political and media criticism provoked by recent demonstrations. The fiercest controversy erupted around a London demonstration earlier this year against the publication of Danish cartoons showing the Prophet Muhammad. A number of the protesters had their faces covered, one was dressed as a mock suicide-bomber and some carried placards with slogans including 'Behead those who insult Islam.' Ghaffur, speaking in a BBC interview, revealed that the police were urging ministers to outlaw flag-burning and to ban protesters from covering their faces. 'There appears to be a growing public perception that policing of demonstrations is unduly lenient,' he said. 'The reason this is a great country is the tolerance of people. If they start to see images of people who seem to be \"getting away with it\", that starts to erode.' Ghaffur stressed that the proposals were not targeted at the Muslim community generally, and in particular said police were not trying to interfere with Muslim women's wearing a veil. He said he fully expected the Muslim community to back the move as a crackdown on an extremist minority. But Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights group Liberty, ridiculed the proposal as the result of 'watching too many American movies' and said that new regulations were unnecessary. 'We will have to look at the detail of these proposals, but the police already have wide powers, especially for dealing with people wearing masks,' she said. 'I wonder how hardworking officers on the beat today will feel knowing their senior officers are spending so much time dreaming up unnecessary legislation.' But Labour MP Shahid Malik, whose Dewsbury constituency was home to one of the 7 July suicide bombers, voiced support for Ghaffur's comments. 'The burning of flags at demonstrations or pickets is clearly an act that has the power to incite violence,' he said. 'It is intimidating and often allows a few thugs to hijack an otherwise legitimate and peaceful protest. These appear to be sensible proposals which I believe all sensible people, irrespective of religion or race, will support.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
