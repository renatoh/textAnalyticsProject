From their semi-final match to decide their place in the final, against BMW Oracle Racing, it must be assumed that Team New Zealand are back in business with a vengeance. Skipper Dean Barker and tactician Terry Hutchinson produced a sparkling performance and repeatedly fought off attacks from the most highly funded team in the history of the event. BMW Oracle's skipper, Chris Dickson, led in the early stages, but the Kiwis struck back with some classic match-race tactics to lead around the first mark by 11 seconds, and held off repeated challenges downwind. BMW Oracle made a better choice of mark to round at the leeward gate and came back to be bow-to-bow with the Kiwis and the two boats rounded the windward mark overlapped, one second apart. The cool of Barker held fast through a long battle to the finish, crossing the line 11 seconds clear: 2-1 to the Kiwis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
