The 24-year-old will be out for at least three weeks and could be sidelined for twice as long. Chelsea need the injury to settle down further before they can be sure how serious the damage is. They know for certain, though, that Duff will miss at least four matches, starting with Friday's Premiership game at Charlton Athletic. A three-week lay-off would rule Duff out of a further two league fixtures - at home to Portsmouth and Liverpool -and force him to sit out the third-round FA Cup tie against Watford at Vicarage Road. He would most likely miss the game at Leicester City on January 11 also, even in a best-case scenario. The Republic of Ireland international's extended absence comes as a blow to the Chelsea head coach Claudio Ranieri. It removes one of Chelsea's most reliable sources of width and creativity, and Duff has also chipped in with goals - including a valuable equaliser at Leeds United this month. Duff dislocated his right shoulder in the early stages of Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Fulham, falling awkwardly as he struck a shot while being challenged by Sean Davis. Chelsea's medical staff will soon know whether the best solution will be for him to undergo arthroscopic surgery to clean the shoulder joint. The \u00a317m summer signing from Blackburn Rovers had his shoulder put back in place in the dressing room at Loftus Road by the club's doctor Neil Frazer and went to hospital for x-rays, which revealed there was no crack or break. Duff has since had scans and Chelsea are waiting to learn whether there has been significant ligament or muscle damage, which would be the worst scenario. At the club's training ground yesterday it was apparent that Duff's shoulder is causing him some discomfort as he used his left arm to shake hands with Juan Sebastian Veron. Ranieri said immediately after the Fulham match that he hoped Duff would need no more than two or three weeks to recover but that could prove optimistic. He could try to purchase a replacement next month if he sees fit. The Italian revealed that his mother is always upset when Duff does not play. He said: \"When Duff is not in the squad my mother, who is 84, kills me. 'Why not Damien?' she says.\" Ranieri replaced Duff with Joe Cole at Fulham and the former West Ham United midfielder looks the obvious long-term replacement, whether playing at left midfield or behind the strikers. Jesper Gronkjaer could also feature regularly in Duff's absence because he is the only player in the squad, besides the Irishman, who might be described as a natural winger. The Danish international's crossing, though, tends to be more erratic than Duff's. For the Boxing Day game at the Valley, Ranieri has Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink available again after the Dutch striker served a one-match suspension for accumulating five yellow cards. However, Chelsea remain without three notable players - Eidur Gudjohnsen, Veron and Emmanuel Petit - who are all carrying injuries. Gudjohnsen, who has been out of the team with a sprained ankle, trained with the squad yesterday for the first time in just under a month and hopes to be in contention for the game against Portsmouth at Stamford Bridge on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
