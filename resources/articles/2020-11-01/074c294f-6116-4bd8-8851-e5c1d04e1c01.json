By early January, there were 27 cases in the Chinese city. Within a couple of weeks, airports in Asia were screening all passengers who passed through their doors. Weeks on, UK airports still were not \u2013 despite three direct flights a week from Wuhan to Heathrow. Screening is ineffective as a method to stop the spread of a virus such as Covid-19, said one scientist. We should have done it at least for the Wuhan flights, said another. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been a great imposition.\u201d \u201cWe left our doors open,\u201d said a public health expert, with barely controlled fury. \u201cAnd it contributed substantially to the rapid growth of the virus in the UK.\u201d Such a back and forth was the defining feature of BBC Two\u2019s Lockdown 1.0: Following the Science? It is the latest contribution to what I suspect will become a string of more-or-less excellent documentaries about the UK\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. (The first was Channel 4\u2019s The Country That Beat the Virus, which compared and contrasted South Korea\u2019s response to the advent of Covid with ours \u2013 no spoilers, but we don\u2019t come out of it well.) Lockdown 1.0 also intertwined, though less overtly, two narratives. One involved the evolving amount and quality of the data that the scientists \u2013 modellers, virologists, epidemiologists \u2013 were receiving and, therefore, the predictions and other information they could obtain from it and hand on to groups such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and then to government ministers. The other narrative strand involved those ministers and what Professor Anthony Costello, a former director of maternal, child and adolescent health at the World Health Organization, described as \u201cthe managerial issue \u2013 how to test, how to gather the results, how to lock down, how to trace, how to isolate, and how to scale all that up \u2013 quickly\u201d. Again, no spoilers but \u2026 What we might call, in bleak reference to earlier, happier, altogether easier times, \u201cthe science bit\u201d was perhaps the more illuminating. The managerial issue is generally writ larger on our screens and in our newspapers as it is happening. The beavering away with numbers and in laboratories, less so. The science bit, perhaps tellingly, was also where most of the back-and-forth took place. The managerial response did not admit much nuance. There was evident frustration, for example, among many of the modellers who comprised the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) about the fact that only Imperial College \u2013 as an established collaborative centre with the WHO \u2013 had access to what was, at the beginning, the best (though by no means perfect) data, coming out of China. Dr Ian Hall from Manchester University, deputy chair of SPI-M, noted: \u201cThe public may be surprised to hear we were using data from Wikipedia very early on \u2013 but it really was the only data publicly available.\u201d Juxtaposed with them was Professor Graham Medley of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and chair of SPI-M. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as saying: \u2018Make it all publicly available.\u2019 People own it; it includes patient information.\u201d Costello professed himself \u201cpretty shocked\u201d by the situation. The whole point of science and scientists in these circumstances, he said, was to share findings openly. There were many more moments and insights that complicated \u2013 in a good way, by giving more detail, by exposing more structures, by expanding vistas \u2013 the view we take from headlines, social media or, if we are committed, articles. The uncomfortable truth is that there are often no good choices, and that it can be irremediably unclear which choice is the best of a bad lot. Likewise, the bitter fact is that people cannot always be made to follow the best paths and, therefore, impositions on them must be watered down if they are to have any effect. The data scientists made the nearest thing to an unequivocal error with the modelling they did around the risk in care homes, by failing to understand the movement of staff between homes. Should they have known about agency workers? If not, who should have told them? Still, we are not yet at the stage of apportioning blame \u2013 although there will surely be many documentaries to come that will deal with exactly that. By the end of this one, it was possible to feel both better and worse about the state we are in. There are people out there, definitely, who have our ignorant little backs. But the search for an overarching synthesising intelligence \u2013 some kind of \u201cprime\u201d minister who could gather up all the reins, say \u2013 continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
