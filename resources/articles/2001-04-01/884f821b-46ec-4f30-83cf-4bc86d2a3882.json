The former Beatle has seen his bank balance swell by \u00a3163m in the past year to cement his reputation as Britain's richest musician. With an estimated personal fortune of \u00a3713m, the singer-songwriter is worth nearly \u00a3300m more than Lord Andrew Lloyd-Webber - his closest rival in the rich musician stakes - and almost \u00a3600m more than his former surviving bandmates, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. The details of Sir Paul's wealth will be published this weekend in the Sunday Times Rich List 2001, alongside details of the nation's richest landowners, entrepreneurs and sports stars. Last year the list - which takes into account all identifiable wealth, including land, property, art, racehorses, shares in any quoted companies, and in the case of musicians, royalties - put the 58-year-old in top place with an estimated fortune of \u00a3550m. But his wealth soared this year due to the \u00a3138m he inherited from his wife Linda, who died in April 1998, and sales of the Beatles 1 album, which had sold 12m copies by the end of last year, and the launch of the anthology book on the Beatles. Royalties - huge in comparison with current stars, many of whom do not own the rights to words and music - and his fiscal prudence have also contributed. \"McCartney is quite canny with his money, he doesn't spend a lot,\" explained Ian Coxon, the list's editor. The multimillionaire musician's increased wealth now puts him 36th in the overall list of Britain's richest 1,000 people. The richest female musician - and the sixth richest musician overall - is Madonna, who qualifies for the first time this year after her marriage in December to Guy Ritchie, the British director. The list places their combined fortune at \u00a3180m, with the majority of the wealth believed to come from the pop queen. With the average age of those on the list being 53, the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, 57 and worth \u00a3150m, and Keith Richards, also 57 and worth \u00a3130m, remain securely in the top 10, while over-50-year-olds Phil Collins, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, David Bowie, the Bee Gees, Tom Jones and Eric Clapton make up much of the top 20. Among sportsmen, world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis tops the list, with a fortune of \u00a375m and an overall position of 455, while featherweight Naseem Hamed tops the list for wealthiest sportsman aged 30 or under with wealth of \u00a330m. Former England skipper Alan Shearer, worth \u00a317m, comes second in the youthful rich stakes, followed by David Beckham - worth \u00a330m with his wife, Victoria, but personally worth \u00a312m.
