There was too much breathless chat squashed into his introduction; all interaction with his co-host for the first half-hour, Kelly Jones from the Stereophonics, fell flat; and then the high-profile competition, to win tickets to see Prince, descended into near farce. As if that wasn't bad enough, relations with Sally Traffic were glacial. If you heard only the first hour, you might have empathised with outraged Radio 2 listeners who have bombarded the station's messageboards with complaints since Evans's appointment to replace Johnny Walker. But in the second hour, glimpses of the Evans magic returned as he relaxed and went with the pace of each item, rather than forcing it. Freed from his \"zoo\" format of old, what Evans does best these days is sympathetic interaction with listeners, lapping up the details of their days. That will be at the core of this show as it settles down, and key to its likely success."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
