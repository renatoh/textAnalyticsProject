At a New York fundraising event on Monday, Biden spoke about his work as a senator from Delaware with two racist Democrats, James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman E Talmadge of Georgia. He disagreed with them, he said, but worked with them and \u201cgot things done \u2026 with some civility\u201d. Reportedly assuming an imitation southern drawl, he also said Eastland \u201cnever called me \u2018boy\u2019, he always called me \u2018son\u2019\u201d. In a southern context, \u201cboy\u201d is a racist and demeaning form of address used by white people to black men. Booker, who is African American, led criticism of Biden\u2019s remarks and said the former vice-president should apologise. Biden retorted: \u201cCory should apologise. He knows better. There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. I\u2019ve been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period.\u201d The former vice-president and the New Jersey senator spoke on Wednesday evening and both attended events hosted by African American Democrats in South Carolina this weekend, during which Biden told MSNBC host and civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton his remarks had been taken out of context. \u201cI do understand the consequence of the word \u2018boy\u2019, but it wasn\u2019t said in any of that context at all,\u201d Biden said. He did not apologise but said \u201cto the extent that anybody thought I meant something different, that is not what I intended\u201d. On Sunday, Booker told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cI\u2019ve said my piece. I have a lot of respect for Joe Biden and a gratitude towards him, and \u2026 I have to \u2026 be candid with him, to speak truth to power. \u201cHe is a presidential nominee and to say something \u2013 and again it\u2019s not about working across the aisle, if anything I\u2019ve made that a hallmark of my time in the Senate to get big things done and legislation passed. \u201cThis is about him evoking a terrible power dynamic that he showed a lack of understanding or insensitivity to by invoking this idea that he was called \u2018son\u2019 by white segregationists who, yes, they see him, in him, their son.\u201d Booker said he did not understand Biden\u2019s claim to have been taken out of context, as he had \u201clistened to the full totality of what he was talking about and frankly I heard from many, many African Americans who found the comments hurtful. \u201cLook, we make mistakes, we sometimes tread upon issues that maybe we aren\u2019t knowledgeable of. I don\u2019t think the vice-president should need this lesson but this was a time for him to be healing and to be helpful especially the time that he is looking to bring this party together and lead us in what is the most important election of our lifetime. \u201cAnd I was disappointed, I\u2019ve said my piece, we had a very constructive conversation, again I have a tremendous amount of respect and appreciation for the vice-president. That\u2019s why again I felt it really important especially with our friends not to just sweep things under the rug but to be candid and straightforward with each other.\u201d On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday another contender for the Democratic nomination, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, was given his own chance to be candid and straightforward. \u201cIf your question is [do] I think Joe Biden is a racist?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely not. No I don\u2019t. Not for a second. Joe is a friend of mine. I like Joe and I hope very much that this campaign will be about the real issues facing the American people and not, you know, ugly attacks.\u201d But he also said he thought \u201cJoe owes the country an apology \u2026 and that it is one thing to work with people in the Senate as you have to do, as every senator does, I do, with people who have fundamental disagreements with. That\u2019s one thing. You do that. That\u2019s your job. \u201cBut it\u2019s another thing to kind of extol those relationships. You cannot be extolling people who really were part of a disgusting system that oppressed and terrorised millions of African Americans.\u201d Attacks on Biden over his long record as a legislator \u2013 including a stand in the 1970s against busing to end school segregation \u2013 gaffes made in two presidential runs and behaviour towards women have been a feature of the run-up to the Democratic debates. In Miami this week Booker will take the stage in the first debate on Wednesday and Biden will be part of the second, on Thursday. Biden leads most polls of the 23-strong field from its ideological centre. The realclearpolitics.com national polling average puts him 16.9% clear of Sanders in second. The same average places Booker seventh on 2.3%, behind Elizabeth Warren in third, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke. Harris also spoke to CBS on Sunday. Asked about Biden\u2019s remarks, the California senator said she was troubled by his \u201cpraising and coddling individuals who made it their life\u2019s work and built their reputation off of segregation of the races\u201d. Harris, whose mother was born in India and whose father came to the US from Jamaica, added: \u201cI would not be a member of the United States Senate if those men that he praised had their way. \u201cWe cannot be ignorant of the history of race in this country. And certainly anyone who is a leader should not be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
