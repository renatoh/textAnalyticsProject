Here, Holly Throsby takes centre stage on a tranquil ballad reminiscent of the work on her outstanding 2011 album Team, while the other two provide countermelodies, coming together for an occasional harmony. A cantering acoustic guitar figure rolls over and over, a double bass solemnly nods in approval, while sparse brass creeps in towards the end to add weight. The production is warm and intimate, closely mic\u2019d while letting the room breathe. Let It Out is pure comfort music, a soothing salve from artists who want to heal you and reassure you that being human is enough. For more: Seeker Lover Keeper play Sydney\u2019s Lansdowne Hotel on 12 July and Northcote Social Club in Melbourne on 13 July. Pnau \u2013 Solid Gold For fans of: M83, School of Seven Bells, Cut Copy The warmest song that Pnau have released in years, Solid Gold is just that: a slice of euphoric pop that recalls M83 at their most John Hughes-meets-Virgin Suicides channelling, landing just 18 months since their last album Changa. It\u2019s worlds away from that album\u2019s world-beating singles Go Bang and Chameleon though, with a much richer technicoloured sound that lives in the same universe as Stardust\u2019s Music Sound Better With You \u2013 like an anachronistically produced disco hit beamed in from an alternative universe. Don\u2019t be surprised if Pnau have a Daft Punk-sized hit on their hands here. For more: Pnau will appear at Vanfest in Forbes on 11 May, Darwin\u2019s Bass in the Grass on 18 May and Big Pineapple festival on the Sunshine Coast on 25 May. Lime Cordiale \u2013 Inappropriate Behaviour For fans of: Razorlight, Arctic Monkeys, the Kooks Lime Cordiale are sonic chameleons, relaxing with saxophones and champagne on a yacht with Michael McDonald on one single, and rocking out with Rod and the Faces on the next. Inappropriate Behaviour mines that curiously short-lived early-00s British sound, where the jagged edges of acts like Joy Division and Gang Of Four rub against the sturdy songcraft learned from mid-90s stalwarts Blur and Oasis. The vocals here sound like Alex Turner and the guitars slice like a Libertines track, while the inappropriate behaviour discussed within would be well suited to the plotline of an episode of The Inbetweeners. I didn\u2019t realise how much I missed this sound until I heard this tune. Top shelf, innit. For more: Lime Cordiale play 9 June at the Forum in Melbourne and 15 June at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. Paul Mac \u2013 Redfern Address For fans of: Air France, the Dissociatives, Air Not a song about Paul\u2019s inner-city abode, but a stirring tribute to Paul Keating\u2019s historical 1992 speech in Redfern to launch the International Year of the World\u2019s Indigenous People. In theory, it\u2019s amusing to think about Keating featuring on a dance track, but this is a chilling, sobering listen; as Mac told NITV, Redfern Address is a look back at \u201ca time when a prime minister was up for trying something nation-changing\u201d. Musically, Paul Mac mostly excuses himself from the spotlight, crafting a haunting minimalist backing track far removed from his usual floor-filling fare. Sirens creep in and out, a sad reminder of the theft referenced in Keating\u2019s speech and a nod to the shocking incarceration rates suffered by Indigenous Australians. Thematically, the track is a companion piece of sorts to the score he wrote for Nakkiah Lui\u2019s play How to Rule the World and acts as one of Paul Mac\u2019s most interesting compositions to date \u2013 as well as an important history lesson. For more: Paul Mac\u2019s new album Mesmerism is out now. Hatchie - Obsessed For fans of: My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, the Pains Of Being Pure At Heart Where Harriette Pilbeam\u2019s other Hatchie singles have all possessed a dreamy, heavy-lidded quality that feel like lens-flare on a Polaroid taken in the throes of falling in love, Obsessed is driven by a baggy drumbeat that would have been at home at The Ha\u00e7ienda during the late 80s. This is the closest she has flown to Lost In Translation soundtrack territory, and the frenetic beat makes Obsessed sound like its own Andrew Weatherill remix. Pilbeam\u2019s vocals are all sunshine, landing in that Dolores O\u2019Riordan ballpark, especially when she harmonises with herself. Hatchie has released eight singles so far, and every single one has been an instant classic. Her debut album comes out in a few weeks and I\u2019m predicting it will be an instant classic too. For more: Hatchie\u2019s debut album Keepsake is out 21 June. Rainbow Chan \u2013 Pillar For fans of: Portishead, Massive Attack, Bj\u00f6rk It has been almost three years since Rainbow Chan\u2019s arresting debut album Spacings, and Pillar \u2013 the lead single and title track to her forthcoming follow-up \u2013 is a welcome return and an uncompromising slice of art pop. Like Animal Collective\u2019s Summertime Clothes, this song sounds like a heatwave feels: dripping sweat, whirring AC motors and melting bitumen. It\u2019s a curious effect given the production is otherwise quite glassy, centred as always on Chan\u2019s gymnastic voice, which is pitch-shifted to provide wordless countermelodies as her lead vocal slides in and out of a breathy falsetto that hits like welcome blasts of cool air. Synths splash in slow motion like rusty garden taps, a bassline lumbers in and out, and the entire effect is hypnotic and beautiful. For more: Rainbow Chan\u2019s album Pillar is out this month. Kylie Minogue \u2013 New York City For fans of: Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, Black Eyes Peas It\u2019s amazing how contemporary Kylie Minogue still sounds. This bouncy pop gem synthesises the past two decades of female-fronted pop without leaning too heavily on any one sound, swinging from a verse that\u2019s a bit like Fergie at her most Fergalicious to one of those lush bridge beds Minogue excels at (see: Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Head) before the chorus bounces and struts in like Katy Perry\u2019s California Gurls. There\u2019s also that old Spice Girls trick of name-checking the dance capitals of the world thrown in for the second verse \u2013 but it\u2019s reductive to compare a new Kylie single with anyone else. She is the queen of exactly this type of danceable pop, and long may she reign. For more: Step Back In Time: The Definitive Collection is out 28 June. Bad//Dreems \u2013 Double Dreaming For fans of: The Hives, Spiderbait, Jet With an insistent guitar lick that lands somewhere between Back in Black and Ball and Biscuit \u2013 and a breakneck propulsion that threatens to slide off the rails at every corner \u2013 this is rock\u2019n\u2019roll at its most visceral. A sandpaper vocal dripping with brattiness and a chorus replete with the obligatory woohoo backing threatens to land Bad//Dreems firmly in big dumb rock territory, which they manage to evade by virtue of clever lyrics and a melodic middle eight that jumps out of nowhere. There\u2019s a risky reference to the recent prevalence of pronouns \u2013 after all, rock\u2019n\u2019roll isn\u2019t meant to be safe, right? For more: Bad//Dreems will play the Yours and Owls festival in Wollongong in October. The Clouds \u2013 Check Us Out For fans of: The Mavis\u2019s, Falling Joys, Ratcat After disbanding in 1997 under the strain of record label indifference and solo ambitions, the Clouds reformed for a tour or two in 2011 and 2012, before disappearing again like a puff of smoke. Then they returned with a 2017 EP that bulked up their sound without betraying what was so special about their shimmering pop. This latest single will hopefully further capitalise on the renaissance of the dreamy pop sound they helped popularise throughout the 90s; Check Us Out could comfortably sit alongside Middle Kids on radio playlists, if not for ageism. As it stands, this song slots in nicely with their storied catalogue, a further extension of the aforementioned Zaffre EP. The guitars are bigger and have more grunt, but Jodi Phillis and Trish Young\u2019s vocals are unmistakable as they weave and swirl around each other. Delightful. For more: The Clouds play Oxford Art Factory in Sydney on 13 June, The Triffid in Brisbane on 14 June and Melbourne\u2019s The Corner Hotel on 22 June. Underground Lovers \u2013 The Passer-By For fans of: Ash, Glide, Sunnyboys The Underground Lovers also had a rabid fanbase in the 90s that they couldn\u2019t quite convert into breakthrough commercial success \u2013 and their legacy is all the more powerful because of it. Like the Velvet Underground and Modern Lovers, who I assume they gathered their portmanteau from, the Melbourne band\u2019s stock has only risen in value in the years since they first pulled up stumps around the turn of the century. The Passer-By is among their more straightforward efforts; gone are the swirls of atmospheric guitars, the washes of reverb and the flirtation with dance beats, and in their place stands a steady beat, lightly distorted guitars and a clear-eyed melody that opens up into a truly gorgeous chorus. This is the first taste from their 10th studio album, due later this year, and a good sign that the Undies are still as vital as ever. For more: New album A Left Turn is due out later this year. The band launch The Passer-By at the Lansdowne in Sydney on 8 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
