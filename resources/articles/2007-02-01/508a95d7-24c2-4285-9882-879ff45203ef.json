The study in the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the largest of its kind, shows that a woman's risk of dying from cardiovascular disease is linked to where she lives and that the damage is greater than anyone had suspected. Scientists immediately called for greater curbs on air pollution. \"Our findings show that both what city a woman lived in and where she lived in that city affected her exposure level and her disease risk,\" said Kristin Miller, from the University of Washington, one of the authors of the paper. The researchers used information from more than 65,000 participants aged 50 to 79, living in 36 cities across the United States, in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. None of the women had heart disease at the beginning of the study, but nine years on 1,816 of them had suffered a heart attack or stroke, had undergone heart bypass surgery or had died from cardiovascular causes. The researchers linked this information with data on air quality around each woman's home. They not only found a link but discovered that \"the magnitude of health effects may be larger than previously recognised\". Vehicle exhaust, coal-fired power stations, wood-burning fires and stoves and industrial plant all send tiny particles of soot and dust into the air. This particulate matter is too small to be seen by the naked eye but can cause haze over a city. \"These soot particles, which are typically created by fossil-fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants, can contain a mix of chemicals,\" said Joel Kaufman, professor of environmental and occupational health sciences, epidemiology and medicine at the university, who led the study. \"The tiny particles - and the pollutant gases that travel along with them - cause harmful effects once they are breathed in.\" The average particulate levels in the study for the 36 cities ranged from about four to almost 20 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Each 10 microgram rise carried a 76% increase in the chances of dying from any cardiovascular cause. The researchers call for more attention to reducing air pollution. \"These results suggest that efforts to limit long-term exposure to fine particulate pollution are warranted,\" the authors write. Women are not the same as men when it comes to heart disease, a commentary in the journal by two Harvard experts, Douglas Dockery and Peter Stone, points out. Their coronary arteries are smaller and the Euro Heart Survey found that women with confirmed coronary disease were twice as likely to die or suffer a heart attack as men. But men are also thought to be susceptible to air pollution, although those taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins appeared to be less at risk. The findings of the women's study, they write, \"strongly support the recommendation for tighter standards for long-term fine particulate air pollution\". They suggest that with more work it may be possible to identify which people are at greatest risk and focus any interventions, such as advice, drugs, diet and exercise, on them. The British Heart Foundation said the new research was robust. \"This adds to the mounting evidence that air pollution should be taken seriously as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease,\" said Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director. The foundation was funding research into ways of minimising harm. \"In the meantime, when localised air pollution is particularly high, people with chronic lung disease or coronary heart disease should avoid staying outside for long periods,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
