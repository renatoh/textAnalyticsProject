Alabama is legally the 37th state to allow same-sex marriage, but couples like Robert Povilat and Milton Persinger spent the day frustrated outside a courthouse because a county judge refused to abide by the ruling. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay until the office closes at the end of the day,\u201d said Povilat, who arrived at the Mobile County marriage license department just before 7am on Monday. Mobile County judge Don Davis closed his office doors and windows for more than two hours on Monday, eventually opening for people seeking other services like deeds. Meanwhile, Povilat said he and about a dozen others were still waiting in line at 3pm local time because Davis, like a number of other judges across the state, refused to issue marriage licenses. \u201cWe\u2019re residents of Mobile County. We are residents of Mobile City, and we feel that with the laws that are in effect, that we should have the right to this in our city and in our county,\u201d said Povilat. US district court judge Callie Granade struck down the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage in January, and although she put a hold on the decision, that expired on Monday, paving the way for marriages across the state. \u201cWe felt confident that today the law would be obeyed and they would issues licenses,\u201d said Povilat. Also waiting to marry in Mobile were Cari Searcy and Kimberly McKeand, the plaintiffs responsible for filing the lawsuit that resulted in marriage equality ruling. They had not married as of Monday afternoon because of Davis\u2019s decision to not give out marriage licenses. Their lawyers filed a federal contempt motion against Davis, but Granade turned it down. Just as people started to enter Alabama courthouses in the morning, the supreme court said it would not grant the state\u2019s request to extend the hold on Granade\u2019s decision. The justices decided 7-2 against the stay, certifying that the federal government permits same-sex marriages in the state. The state\u2019s chief justice, Roy Moore, issued an 11th-hour order on Sunday night, ordering telling probate judges not to obey the ruling. \u201cEffective immediately, no probate judge of the State of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent\u201d with state law, Moore said in the order. Moore has been fighting Granade\u2019s ruling for weeks. He has made a career out of opposing the federal government on religious grounds and in 2003 was removed from his post as Alabama chief justice because he refused to remove a granite Ten Commandments monument weighing more than 5,200lb from the state judicial building. He was re-elected to the same post in November 2012. Moore\u2019s statements defy the supremacy clause of the US constitution, which gives federal rulings precedence over lower court rulings. But his comments also helped incite a judicial rebellion in the state, with some judges refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and others abandoning offering marriage services to all people. A similar tactic was also used by Alabama judges decades earlier, when the supreme court ruled in 1967 that bans on interracial marriage are unconstitutional. Alabama\u2019s governor, Robert Bentley, said in a statement that he will not take action against probate judges who ignore the order \u2013 or those following it. \u201cProbate judges have a unique responsibility in our state, and I support them,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cI will not take any action against probate judges, which would only serve to further complicate this issue.\u201d He also said he was disappointed with the supreme court\u2019s decision to not extend the stay pending its own ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans, which is due by the end of June. If the court rules that these bans are unconstitutional, Alabama judges who still refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples could have their hand forced by higher courts or risk being removed from their positions. Equality Alabama and ACLU of Alabama are operating a hotline for people who are refused marriage licenses. ACLU of Alabama\u2019s executive director, Susan Watson, said the hotline had received more than 50 complaints from people in the state. The group hopes to collect enough information to take legal action against probate judges who act against the federal ruling. \u201cThey are putting themselves at risk and I think they need to take a long and hard look at what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Watson, who attended the first marriage in Montgomery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
