Every day I take Berocca, omega-3 and, oh, what's that powder for the knees? We give it to the dog ... Glucosamine sulphate - for my knees and my lower back. They're most affected, as I spend all day standing up. I also drink boiling water with a slice of lemon. I've no idea what it does, but my wife's mother drank it and lived to 99. How do you chill out? I love to walk. We have a lovely garden, so I mow the lawn. A bit of carpentry. But it's difficult, because I start work at 7am and don't get home till 7pm. Then I have some tea, learn my lines, and go to bed by 9pm. And I have to read my daughter a story. She's 32. What foods do you always have in your shopping trolley? Pulses. Lots of pulses. Mayonnaise. Bacon - English. Cheeses. Both types of milk, for adults and children. And chicken. If we're not eating it, the dog is. Do you smoke? I used to, but I gave up five years ago. I just wish I could lay off the crack pipe so easily. Do you drink? All the time. I used not to be able to drink wine because I suffered from reflux and hiatus hernia, but now I can drink like a bastard. I'm a big red wine fan. Are you vain? I'm so vain I wouldn't want anyone to think I'm vain. \u00b7 Martin Clunes is supporting Macmillan Cancer Relief's World's Biggest Coffee Morning on September 30 (macmillan.org.uk/coffee)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
