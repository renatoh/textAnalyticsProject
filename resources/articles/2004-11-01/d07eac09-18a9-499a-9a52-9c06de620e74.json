David Blunkett's plans have already got the blessing of the Common's home affairs select committee, which concluded that they would make a \"significant contribution\" to the fight against crime and terrorism. David Winnick and Bob Russell's vain bid to amend this conclusion \u2013 pointing out that there is no evidence that ID cards stop terrorist attacks \u2013 was overruled by the committee's nine other members. Remarkably few Labour MPs, meanwhile, have shown any opposition to what civil liberties groups believe is a fundamental attack on our rights and freedoms. Only 15 of them signed up to Austin Mitchell's early day motion calling for the plans to be buried in one of the Home Office's deepest draws \u2013 hardly a number likely to worry the government whips' office. While the Liberal Democrats are opposed to ID cards, the Conservatives' position is harder to discern. The party's gone all Gordon Brown on the matter and published five tests \u2013 on cost, civil liberties, privacy and technology - the plans must pass before it backs them. This looks like an attempt to buy time before it backs Mr Blunkett's bill. So don't expect ID cards to be defeated in the Commons. But sign the petition anyway, the House of Lords may show a greater regard for civil liberties."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
