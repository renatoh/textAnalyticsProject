John Cutlack, a structural engineer with 40 years\u2019 experience of working on sports grounds, said the most significant error made by the club\u2019s engineers, Eastwood &amp; Partners, was \u201ca gross over-estimate\u201d of the safe capacity on the Leppings Lane terrace. The figure of 7,200, which was sanctioned and stated on the club\u2019s safety certificate in 1979, and never amended throughout the decade before lethal overcrowding caused the deaths on that terrace, was 1,774 more than the total safe capacity calculated by Cutlack, of 5,426. He agreed with Jason Beer QC, representing Graham Mackrell, Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s club secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster, that the over-calculation was a \u201creally big error\u201d by the firm, which was headed by a distinguished engineer, Dr Wilfred Eastwood. \u201cThe seeds of the disaster were sown by Dr Eastwood\u2019s calculations here,\u201d Beer said. \u201cIn short it was the firm that sowed that seed, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Cutlack replied. Eastwood\u2019s failing, which undermined the safety of the Leppings Lane end where the lethal crush happened in 1989, was \u201cremarkable\u201d and \u201cfundamental\u201d, Cutlack said. It was compounded by other failings, including having insufficient turnstiles at that end, and flaws in the crush barrier system, he said. Mackrell is charged with two criminal offences relating to his duties as the club\u2019s safety officer for the 1989 semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, including an alleged failure to agree with police a change to the turnstile arrangements from those for the semi-final between the same two clubs the previous year. The second charge is that he breached the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 by failing to ensure the number of turnstiles was sufficient to prevent unduly large crowds building up, and failing to draw up contingency plans to cope if that did happen. David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police chief superintendent who commanded the 1989 FA Cup match, is standing trial, alongside Mackrell at Preston crown court, charged with gross negligence manslaughter in relation to the deaths. Cutlack agreed with Ben Myers QC, representing Duckenfield, that the availability of only seven turnstiles for 10,100 people with standing tickets to support Liverpool at the Leppings Lane end was \u201can insufficient number to prevent a build up of a crowd outside the ground\u201d. At the 1988 semi-final, he confirmed, 13 turnstiles were used, for those 10,100, and 4,465 people with tickets for the West Stand seats above the terrace. Cutlack also agreed that several elements at the Leppings Lane end were below standard: \u2022 Signs above the turnstiles were \u201cconfusing\u201d for supporters and did not correspond to the layout depicted on their tickets. \u2022 The tunnel leading to \u201cpens\u201d 3 and 4 of the terrace \u201cshould have been manned to ensure overcrowding did not occur\u201d. \u2022 Its downward slope was \u201cirregular and in places it was too steep\u201d. \u2022 Spans in two crush barriers should not have been removed, because that increased the downward pressure of a crowd surge. \u2022 Four of the crush barriers were \u201csignificantly\u201d lower than the recommended heights in the official \u201cgreen guide\u201d to safety at sports grounds, which also increased the downward pressure, and three were too high. \u2022 The gates in the high metal fence at the front of the terrace, which opened on to the pitch perimeter, were 30% narrower than the green guide recommended width, so did not allow proper emergency access, and the steps up to the gates within the terrace were \u201cirregular\u201d and too high. Cutlack said Eastwood\u2019s initial failing, overcalculating the terrace capacity, was followed by failures to review and amend the capacity when the terrace was divided into the pens in 1981, then further divided in 1985, and when the crush barrier spans were removed in 1986. The judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, gave legal guidance to the jury of six men and six women, reminding them that Mackrell is charged with \u201cvery specific and narrow offences\u201d. He told them: \u201cThose charges do not concern the broader matters relevant to safety at Hillsborough, nor the criticism of the club more generally.\u201d Both Mackrell and Duckenfield have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
