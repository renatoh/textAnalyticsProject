May was a very good month for Hughes, with 25 winners, a Classic and a 20% strike rate, but June promises to be a great deal better. Tomorrow's opening-day card at Ascot offers Hughes a realistic chance to ride a treble, just as he did on the same afternoon last year. Paco Boy, in the Queen Anne Stakes, Canford Cliffs, in the St James's Palace Stakes and Strong Suit, in the Coventry Stakes, all trade at 3-1 or less, while through the rest of the week, Hughes can draw on Richard Hannon's strong squad in the juvenile races. It is no surprise to find him joint-favourite with most layers to finish the meeting as top jockey. \"It's our Cheltenham, and it's very hard to win races there,\" he said yesterday, as he enjoyed the sunshine before a busy afternoon at Salisbury. \"Last year I had three on day one, and then had to wait until Saturday to get another. \"I've got some great rides, and the thing about Ascot is that you don't always have to be on the best horse to win. It comes down to pace and draw, on the round course especially. \"If you're drawn anywhere from one to four there, you're in trouble, because you use up too much horse if you want to get handy, and if you drop in you're giving them an eight-length start. To make up that sort of ground, they have to go very fast up front, and that might happen one time in three. The rest of the time, you have to sit and suffer, and then probably come back in and say sorry.\" Canford Cliffs, winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh last month, has a good draw in stall six in the St James's Palace Stakes, though with three Aidan O'Brien runners in the nine-strong field, Hughes will have some thinking to do. \"It's not set in stone that they will jump and go a good gallop,\" Hughes said. \"It didn't suit Steinbeck [the mount of Johnny Murtagh] to go flat out at The Curragh, so they may not try the same tactic again. They might be there to give Johnny a soft lead, a horse either side to look after him with the rest of us stuck behind. \"But we have Dick Turpin in there as well and he should keep it honest enough, and now I have the key to Canford Cliffs. I know I need to rev him up before pressing the button, and when I did that at The Curragh, he was electric.\" Paco Boy, a 3-1 chance for the Queen Anne Stakes, is up against Rip Van Winkle and Goldikova, described as \"the best miler of the last 15 or 20 years\" by Hughes. \"There are no chinks in her, she's brilliant,\" he said, \"and definitely the one to beat. My hope is that she might get into a battle with Rip Van Winkle. \"Paco Boy looked very good [in the Lockinge Stakes] last time, but it's easy when you have them all beat at the two pole and I don't think the ones behind him would ever start favourite for a Group One. But he is a great little horse to ride, with an electric turn of foot.\" Whatever happens in the Group One races, Hughes is particularly confident that Strong Suit, the winner of his only start to date, will deliver in the Coventry. \"I'm riding some great horses during the week,\" he said, \"but if you took them all away and said I could have only one back, it would be Strong Suit. He is our best two-year-old by a long way. \"I can't wait to ride Canford Cliffs and I'd be looking forward to him more, but I'm under no illusions as I have to make up three lengths on Makfi from the [English] Guineas and I need the race run to suit. \"The Coventry is a straight six furlongs and I think I'm on the best horse. We've won a lot of two-year-old races this season, because our horses are healthy and know their job, not because we just have all of the best two-year-olds. \"It can't be that all of the good ones are in [Richard Hannon's] yard. But in Strong Suit, I think we might have the best two-year-old of all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
