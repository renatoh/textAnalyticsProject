He first floated the idea in March after gutter-balling a 37 at the Pleasant Valley Lanes in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Any decent Tuesday night bowling league would likely expel the president-elect from its roster. At the same time, Obama sports a credible basketball game with a decent first step off the dribble (though he can only go left), solid rebounding instincts and an occasional look-away inside pass. But Obama's White House hoop dream isn't ultimately about athletic preference. It's about nothing less than redefining the cultural persona of the presidency to embrace a new era. Bowling embodies America's stodgy rigidity; basketball, its agile multi-cultural blendedness. Bowling represents an old school America that's as stiff as John McCain's handshake. Based on the linear act of knocking down obstacles directly in one's way, the game reflects a single-mindedness that once helped the United States lay down transcontinental highways by blasting through hillsides and engineer coups against sovereign governments. It's a style more suitable to the cold war world of Harry Truman, who was president when the original bowling alley was installed, and Richard Nixon, the only president to regularly use the facility. Basketball, on the other hand, is all about communal flow. The fast break style that characterises pick-up games played year round in suburban driveways, urban playgrounds and rural school gyms from Compton to Canarsie weaves the kinetic energies of the multitude into a common purpose. Like jazz, American basketball expresses a distinctly African-American esthetic that Obama has called improvisation within a discipline. Basketball culture in America, based on the inclusive concept of the pick-up game, also reflects the collaborative ethic that spirits Obama's message. The simple non-discriminatory rule of pick-up hoops is that any five players who randomly show up suddenly become teammates to challenge the reigning team on the court. In my years playing pick-up ball in greater Detroit and the San Francisco-Oakland area, I've seen how the teams that consistently win on public courts are the ones able to smoothly negotiate underlying differences of athletic style and social identity. Maybe that's one reason Obama still manages to run a decent game despite probably having lost a step at age 47. Pick-up basketball, where the blacktop is analogous to community organising, is about tapping the deeper power of the collective. While basketball emblemises the community spirit of America, bowling has become a conspicuous mark of continuing social segregation. Bowling is by no means the exclusive domain of either white or suburban America, but in recent decades alleys have closed in many large urban centers, reflecting a pattern of white flight. In Washington DC, for example, not one public bowling alley remained by the 1990s. When the chic Lucky Strikes bowling bistro opened in 2003, it appropriated the sport for an elite crowd, imposing a strict dress code that prohibites sports jerseys and cut offs. The White House bowling alley during the Bush years has itself become a troubling symbol of national dislocation. It was indefinitely shut down on 9/11 and the league of White House staffers that played there was forced to move operations to suburban Virginia. The league became a victim to the Bush administration's insular worldview that suspects every uncontrolled activity in its midst. After the equipment in this now darkened alleyway gets shipped to the Smithsonian, Obama can build an open-access half court where everyone from heads of state to ground floor security might fill the line-up. Imagine key congressional leaders resolving an impasse on healthcare reform in a three-on-three match, kitchen staff playing H-O-R-S-E after a state dinner or, at the highest summit of get-tough diplomacy, Obama in Air Jordans going one-on-one without preconditions against Iran's Ahmadinejad. In the world of pick-up hoops, whoever shows up regardless of ability or reputation gets a fair shot. Maybe the day will even arrive when the administration opens the court to its Washington DC backyard, and runs a programme allowing kids from the neighbourhoods special security clearance to shoot around on Saturday mornings. When I was a boy, a visit to the White House never had much appeal with all those official-looking rooms cordoned off by velvet ropes. Nothing in the White House indicated it had any connection to my own life. Obama's basketball court could help Americans acknowledge that we all dwell in the same arena. At the White House, a bit of democracy might be put in play every time a visitor steps onto the court, takes a dribble and sinks a jumper from the free throw line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
