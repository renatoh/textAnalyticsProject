Despite the cultural life that flourished there, Theresienstadt was effectively a transit camp for Auschwitz, where Hans Kr\u00e1sa, Viktor Ullmann and Pavel Haas were executed in October 1944; Gidon Klein died in the F\u00fcrstenberg camp a few months later. Both Ullmann's Third Quartet (with its echoes of early Schoenberg) and Klein's folksy Trio were composed in Theresienstadt. But Haas's programmatic quartet, heavily indebted to his teacher Jan\u00e1\u010dek, dates from 1925, and Kr\u00e1sa's children's opera Brundib\u00e1r, from which David Matthews extracted this instrumental suite, from 1938 (though it was performed more than 50 times in the camp). It's hard to separate any of this music from the life histories of the composers. But these sharply contrasting pieces, played with typical Nash polish and intelligence, show there was no shared Theresienstadt style \u2013 just a collection of promising creative careers never allowed to reach fulfilment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
