Of course, Manuel [Pellegrini] was a big influence because he is one of the best coaches in the world, and who doesn\u2019t want to work with people like that?\u201d Describing the 23-year-old as a \u201ccreative, technically-gifted playmaker with an eye for goal\u201d, West Ham confirmed that he is the club\u2019s second most expensive signing, behind Felipe Anderson, who joined for an initial \u00a333.5m last summer. Fornals is part of the Spain squad taking part in the Under-21 European Championship in Italy this month, and will join up with the Premier League club after the tournament. Mario Husillos, the West Ham director of football, knows Fornals from his time at M\u00e1laga and moved quickly to sign the midfielder. \u201cI know we have signed an incredible professional and an incredible character,\u201d Husillos said. \u201cHe joins us a young player, yet with strong experience and already proven at the very highest level.\u201d The capture of Fornals, who has been capped twice by Spain, will be hugely satisfying for Pellegrini. West Ham\u2019s manager is determined to strengthen his midfield and believes the 23-year-old, one of the brightest talents in La Liga, will improve his side\u2019s creative prowess. West Ham were quick to move on after attempts to sign Andre G\u00f3mes ended when the Barcelona midfielder indicated a desire to join Everton, and have cooled their interest in Stanislav Lobotka after holding talks with Celta Vigo about the Slovakia midfielder last weekend. West Ham had spoken to Vigo about signing Lobotka and Maxi G\u00f3mez in a deal worth \u00a350m. Pellegrini wants a new striker after releasing Andy Carroll and selling Lucas P\u00e9rez to Alav\u00e9s. He retains an interest in G\u00f3mez, although any agreement to sign the 22-year-old Uruguay forward remains some way off. Fornals is West Ham\u2019s third signing of the summer, following the arrivals of back-up goalkeepers Roberto and David Martin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
