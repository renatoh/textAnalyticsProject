Johnson, who has kept a low profile in the contest so far, launched his bid in earnest with a video posted on social media highlighting his campaigning credentials. His team then released endorsements throughout the day from MPs across the party\u2019s spectrum, including the Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng and Simon Hart, who coordinates the moderate Brexit Delivery Group. Concern is growing among some Conservative MPs that a change in the rules could lead to a coronation of Johnson before some of the lesser-known candidates have had a chance to gain momentum. There are 13 declared candidates and the list could grow on Tuesday. Supporters of the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, say she will make a decision about running after an evening conference call with grassroots activists. The 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, which will run the contest, will hold an executive meeting on Tuesday as calls grow for changes to the rules to reduce the size of the field. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, compared the race to the Grand National and suggested changes were needed to prevent the contest from dragging on. \u201cIf you already know it\u2019s going to be a bit of a struggle to get over the first fence, let alone Becher\u2019s Brook ahead, then maybe you should pull up,\u201d he said in a speech at Policy Exchange on Monday. \u201cThere is no embarrassment in that.\u201d Several of the committee\u2019s executive members have suggested candidates should be required to have the support of at least 12 MPs before they can be on the ballot. Such a cut-off would eliminate a significant number of the candidates: Mark Harper, Rory Stewart, Esther McVey, James Cleverly, Andrea Leadsom, Kit Malthouse and Sam Gyimah. Cleverly, a Brexit minister who is running a campaign as a new generation candidate, said the Conservative membership needed to be given \u201cthe chance to be gutsy\u201d and warned against \u201crushing\u201d the contest. \u201cThis is a real opportunity for us to properly test ideas and people and we are looking for somebody who will not only deliver Brexit but be leader of the party for years into the future and has to reach out to a lot of voters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to win the next general election and I think rushing it could be counterproductive. Investing maybe an extra five days in the process to make sure we get it right for the next five years is time well spent.\u201d One supporter of an outsider candidate said they believed some on the 1922 Committee were trying to rig the rules in favour of Johnson, arguing it was highly unfair on some hopefuls to change the rules before any hustings had taken place to let them demonstrate their potential. But one of the leading candidates said it made sense to knock out the \u201cminnows\u201d in the race and concentrate on those who had a chance of winning. Supporters of Johnson increasingly believe the race is likely to head for a \u201cpsychodrama\u201d of a run-off between their candidate and Michael Gove, who knocked him out of the race in 2016. However, those around Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock all insist they are in with a chance of prevailing, with about 150 Conservative MPs still to say who they are backing. In Johnson\u2019s video, released on Monday morning, he meets voters and promises one former Conservative voter that he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal. The video expresses support for increased education funding and police numbers and shows Johnson agreeing with a voter on the need for more stop and search. The launch was not entirely without a hitch. Johnson was criticised for claiming that crime in London went down 20% while he was mayor. The Liberal Democrats pointed to official government figures suggesting police-recorded crime in London fell by 15% from 2007-08 to 2015-16. Ed Davey, a Lib Dem leadership candidate, said: \u201cFor Johnson to kick off his leadership campaign with a lie is at least very on-brand.\u201d Liz Truss, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, who had been considering a run at the leadership herself, was the first of the current cabinet to endorse Johnson over the weekend. It is believed unlikely that Johnson will secure the backing of the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd \u2013 a joint ticket that had been nicknamed \u201cBamber\u201d \u2013 because of Rudd\u2019s discomfort at serving in a cabinet that could pursue a no-deal Brexit. Other prominent names backing Johnson include the chair of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former defence secretary Gavin Williamson and the backbencher Zac Goldsmith. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 4 June 2019 to reflect updated content."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
