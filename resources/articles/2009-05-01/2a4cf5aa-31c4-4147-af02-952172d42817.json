Today, he gets a chance to restate his claims in a fascinating, highly competitive Dante Stakes at York. This race has been the best of the Derby trials in recent years, with the winner going on to Epsom glory three times in the last five years. Tartan Bearer, who edged out Frozen Fire in last year's Dante, was beaten just half a length in the Classic, while the runner-up then won the Irish Derby. Fame And Glory was so impressive on Sunday that he seems set to start the Derby as favourite, whatever happens today. But Crowded House (2.40) is certainly capable of giving the bookmakers something to think about. The exact worth of his storming success in the Racing Post Trophy last October is yet to be confirmed, as the placed horses have not raced since, while the fourth, Set Sail, is among Aidan O'Brien's second tier and was used as a pacemaker on his reappearance. Crowded House's previous outing, in the Tattersalls Million, is arguably stronger form, as he was beaten half a length by Donativum, who then won the turf race for juveniles at the Breeders' Cup. Crowded House seems sure to make a fine three-year-old and Brian Meehan's stable has been in excellent form at the highest level recently. The chestnut will be ready for today and his rivals have a great deal more to prove. That is especially the case for Kite Wood, bought by Godolphin from Michael Jarvis's yard after winning a Group Three at Ascot last autumn. The beaten horses have let that form down since then and the recent record of Godolphin's acquisitions is not good. O'Brien's runners must be respected after last week's 25-1 winner in the Chester Vase but he has not usually sent his best Derby candidates for this trial. The biggest danger may come from Sans Frontieres, second in the Craven Stakes behind Delegator, a stablemate of Crowded House. That mile race was only his second run and he is bred to need at least today's 10 furlongs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
