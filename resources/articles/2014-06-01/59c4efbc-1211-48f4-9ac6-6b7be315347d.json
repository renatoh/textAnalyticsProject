Eto\u2019o tweeted news of his injury and Cameroon\u2019s media spokesman, Laurence Fotso, said: \u201cEto\u2019o has been told by the doctors he cannot play for the next 10 days.\u201d That would rule the striker out of the final group game against Brazil in Bras\u00edlia next Monday. Eto\u2019o has battled with the knee problem from the end of the English league season with Chelsea. \u201cFor three and a half months, I have not had the time to recover,\u201d he told Cameroon state television on Sunday. \u201cYou could see that even in the buildup to the World Cup I hadn\u2019t had a lot of practice.\u201d He said he felt pain from the ninth minute of Cameroon\u2019s opening World Cup match, against Mexico, which he finished. Reuters Italy The midfielder Daniele De Rossi has neck pain and is sitting out training, adding to Italy\u2019s injury problems. The centre-back Andrea Barzagli worked out individually on Monday to rest the various aches and pains he has struggled with for months. The captain, Gianluigi Buffon, and full-back Mattia De Sciglio also remained out. Buffon hurt his left ankle and knee a day before Italy\u2019s 2-1 win over England. De Sciglio missed their opener with a pulled muscle. Salvatore Sirigu, who performed well in goal in Buffon\u2019s absence against England, was also treated at the end of Monday\u2019s training session under a torrid sun at the Portobello resort. Sirigu had ice applied to his neck after suffering from the heat but said it was not a concern. AP"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
