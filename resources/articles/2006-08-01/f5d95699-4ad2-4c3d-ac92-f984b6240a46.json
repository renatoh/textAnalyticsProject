Spurs have agreed to pay \u20ac5m (\u00a33.4m) for the 23-year-old, who spent 18 months on loan at White Hart Lane, and are ready to send their Brazilian defender Rodrigo Defendi to the Serie A club as part of the transfer. Mido should conclude the move in London today or tomorrow, subject to a medical and personal terms, before flying to Egypt to prepare for a weekend international against Burundi. His chances of joining Spurs appeared to have disappeared in May, when he returned to Roma and Martin Jol signed Dimitar Berbatov and looked elsewhere for another forward, but Spurs have returned to a player who scored 11 goals for them last season. In Mido and Berbatov, Jol will have the two tall, powerful forwards he wants to complement Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe. Mido's form was largely unimpressive towards the end of last season but the head coach saw enough earlier in the campaign to convince him to make this move. Blackburn Rovers tried to sign Mido during the summer from Roma, whose coach Luciano Spalletti has made little effort to hold on to the striker. Spalletti is keen to sign Defendi, who has never broken into the first team at Spurs but spent last season in Italy on loan at Udinese. The 20-year-old was brought to White Hart Lane by the former sporting director Frank Arnesen in 2004. Tottenham will have to move swiftly to stand a chance of signing Steed Malbranque from Fulham after West Ham yesterday agreed a \u00a32m fee for the midfielder. The deal is subject to a medical and it is conceivable that Spurs will make a late attempt to snatch the midfielder, for whom they have had one offer turned down. Their hopes of signing Middlesbrough's Stewart Downing seem to be fading and Malbranque is among others on their list. Malbranque is believed to favour a move to Spurs but West Ham have put together a lucrative financial package which they hope will ensure the 26-year-old joins them. Malbranque has rejected offers from Bolton Wanderers, Everton and Middlesbrough to stay in London, having turned down a new contract at Fulham. He has been banished from the first-team squad at Craven Cottage after refusing to commit his long-term future to the club, and Fulham have accepted a far lower bid than they were initially seeking to push through a deal before the transfer window closes. The manager Chris Coleman intends to put the money towards a central defender and right midfielder. Malbranque is unlikely to be able to play an immediate part for his next club because of a groin problem. He is expected to require surgery that will keep him out for a minimum of three weeks. Wigan Athletic are interested in signing Jason Euell, who has been told by Charlton Athletic's manager Iain Dowie that he is free to leave. Euell started only five Premiership matches last season under Alan Curbishley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
