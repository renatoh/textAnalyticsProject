But on Thursday, lawmakers left Washington after their first week back since the Florida school shooting \u2013 without a plan. There was a flurry of activity on Capitol Hill and a sense of urgency in both parties that inaction was no longer an option in the face of public outrage, led by the Florida students who survived the attack. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, announced that the chamber would move on to banking legislation next week \u2013 extinguishing hope that lawmakers would act swiftly to pass gun legislation after the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting that left 17 students and educators dead. \u201cWe\u2019d love to do that at some point,\u201d McConnell told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m hoping there\u2019s a way forward.\u201d The timeline means Congress will probably be embroiled in a debate over guns for several more weeks. On 24 March, as many as 500,000 people are expected to attend the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d rally against gun violence in Washington, organized by Parkland students. Some lawmakers hope the event will act as a deadline for legislative action. The Senate had appeared on track to move forward with a proposal most lawmakers viewed as modest at best, when the president upended the debate and demanded a stronger bill at a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers this week. During the televised meeting on Wednesday, Trump repeatedly embraced legislation that the National Rifle Association has long opposed. The bill, first introduced by the Republican senator Pat Toomey and Democratic senator Joe Manchin after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, would expand background checks to weapons purchased at gun shows and online. \u201cIf the president embraces something like Manchin-Toomey, a bill that had broad bipartisan support but couldn\u2019t quite get to 60 votes, the president could really make the difference,\u201d Toomey said, appealing to Trump from the president\u2019s favorite morning show, Fox &amp; Friends on Fox News. Toomey admitted the bill still did not have enough support to pass the Senate, but said that could change with a serious lobbying effort by the president, who maintains strong support from the conservative voters most likely to oppose such legislation. Democrats, too, sensed a similar opportunity and urged Trump to put some \u201celbow grease\u201d into the fight to help sway Republicans. \u201cOne public meeting will not close background check loopholes,\u201d said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate. \u201cOne hour of television won\u2019t get assault weapons off our streets. The NRA has had the Republican party in a headlock for decades. Only the president \u2013 this president \u2013 will have the power to overcome their strength.\u201d Schumer said the moment offered the \u201cbest chance we\u2019ve had in decades\u201d for Congress to pass consequential gun control legislation . Among other measures, Senate Democrats want a full debate on whether to restore a ban on semi-automatic rifles. The plan with the most support after the Parkland shooting is an incremental bill that would incentivize public agencies to improve reporting to the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Checks System. But even Democratic supporters of the legislation say it\u2019s inadequate. And on Wednesday, Trump appeared to agree, suggesting the bill, called Fix Nics, was too incremental. He asked its sponsor, the Senate majority whip, John Cornyn, to work with other members of the Senate to turn it into a broader background bill \u2013 with a better name. Trump called for a \u201cbeautiful\u201d bill that would expand background checks on gun purchases while also endorsing measures that would bolster security on school campuses, restrict young people from purchasing certain weapons, and remove guns from the hands of the mentally ill without a court order. The latter enraged conservatives, including NRA members and at Breitbart, the Trump-friendly website, which denounced the president as a \u201cgun grabber\u201d. The president also repeatedly accused Republicans of being \u201cpetrified\u201d of the NRA, declaring himself unafraid to stand up to the powerful gun lobby. Just before 4am on Thursday morning, Trump said on Twitter that \u201cBackground Checks a big part of conversation\u201d. He also said that many ideas, \u201csome good &amp; some not so good\u201d, came out of Wednesday\u2019s White House meeting on gun control and school safety. Wednesday\u2019s White House event, like several past policy meetings with the president, left Republicans stunned and confused after he urged lawmakers to resurrect legislation that breaks with decades of party orthodoxy. \u201cIt was wild,\u201d Senator John Thune, the third-ranking Republican, said of the televised meeting. \u201cBut I think the president is going to have to narrow his list of issues he would like to see addressed and figure out what\u2019s realistic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
