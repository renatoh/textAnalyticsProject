Since an Italian missionary was identified as CAR\u2019s first coronavirus case last month, xenophobia has been on the rise. Stories widely published in the country\u2019s newspapers and on social media have portrayed foreigners as unwelcome importers of a disease that could further impoverish the country. Thousands of non-nationals are employed in CAR by UN agencies and aid organisations, which provide about 70% of the country\u2019s health services. The UN has extended a curfew for employees due to \u201crecent incidents of verbal aggression and intimidation as well as risks of stigmatisation of UN staff, international NGOs and humanitarian actors\u201d, according to an internal memo. The UN peacekeeping force has suspended most internal travel and stopped bringing in new contingents of \u201cblue helmets\u201d. Alarmist rhetoric in CAR\u2019s media is stoking animosity. One tabloid has accused Emmanuel Macron\u2019s administration in France of using coronavirus \u201cto destabilise French-speaking African countries\u201d. Others described the arrival of the infected Italian as \u201cthe poisoning of an entire people\u201d and have raged about \u201ca genocide\u201d against Africans. \u201cThe spike in threats and violence against foreigners and humanitarian personnel, also spread by the media, pose significant safety and security risks that can result in reduced operations when they are needed the most,\u201d said the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) in a recent report. \u201cThe aid pipeline could face ruptures and stock-outs, depriving the most affected people from the only existing safety net.\u201d Humanitarian groups fear the impact of the pandemic in CAR could be disastrous. After years of sectarian violence, the country\u2019s health infrastructure is virtually nonexistent; rebel militias control three-quarters of its territory, and 600,000 people have been uprooted from their homes into overcrowded displacement camps. Less than a dozen coronavirus cases have so far been registered, although many more are suspected given the lack of testing equipment. \u201cPeople are very worried about this new disease,\u201d said Maaike Hersevoort, chief of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in CAR. \u201cThey associate foreigners with corona. If engagement is not done well then there could be an escalation.\u201d CAR\u2019s government has made moves to rein in the sensationalist coverage of coronavirus. On Wednesday, health minister Pierre Soms\u00e9 released a code of conduct for reporting on the outbreak responsiblyand asked for \u201crespect for human rights [and] solidarity, both nationally and internationally\u201d. There are warnings that displaced people living in host communities could be denigrated as virus-spreading outsiders too, as could members of CAR\u2019s Muslim minority \u2013 long marginalised as \u201cArab foreigners\u201d. Growing tensions could lead to fresh clashes. \u201cIncreased xenophobia against several segments of the population poses a high risk of resurgence of intercommunal violence and conflict,\u201d said Ocha. There is widespread distrust in CAR of the French, the country\u2019s former colonial rulers, while regional neighbours Chad and Sudan have interfered with CAR\u2019s internal affairs for decades. More recently, Russian troops have arrived to shore up the beleaguered government, and the Chinese are active in the mineral industry. Foreign aid workers face regular assaults, burglaries, carjackings and even murder. There were 300 incidents recorded last year. Public support for the UN mission, known by its French acronym Minusca, is already low following a sex abuse scandal and its failure to protect civilians. In recent months, an influential pressure group in CAR\u2019s capital, Bangui, has targeted Minusca with an aggressive smear campaign, calling the peacekeepers \u201cthe Minuscavirus\u201d. \u201cOther international organisations are paying the price for the UN mission\u2019s mistakes,\u201d said Fridolin Ngoulou, a Central African journalist. \u201cBut this should not be a reason to attack foreigners.\u201d The challenges were brought into sharp relief by an incident last week, when paramedics in protective gear arrived to collect a member of Minusca\u2019s international staff in Bangui, who was showing symptoms of Covid-19, and had to face down a hostile crowd. \u201cOf course there\u2019s frustration,\u201d said Denise Brown, the humanitarian coordinatorin CAR. \u201cPeople\u2019s everyday lives are really difficult. They suffer from armed conflict, tuberculosis, horrible malaria, diarrhoea, and now all of a sudden there\u2019s something called the coronavirus that might arrive and infect lots of people \u2026 All of that contributes to tension. We need to understand that tension.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
