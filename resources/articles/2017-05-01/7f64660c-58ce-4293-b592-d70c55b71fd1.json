The move, which has been welcomed by campaigners who say that universities focus their syllabuses too much on white British history, will make it compulsory for students to sit one of a number of papers on topics such as the influence of Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi. While the change comes after recent student-led campaigns such as the \u201cRhodes must fall\u201d movement or the UCL-founded \u201cWhy is my curriculum white?\u201d campaign, Oxford insisted that it was not the result of external pressure. \u201cIt is just formalising what is in effect student practice,\u201d said Martin Conway, professor of contemporary European history and chair of the history faculty at the university. \u201cIt was all done and dusted before anybody noticed Cecil Rhodes standing on top of a building.\u201d The change was met with mixed responses. Marie Rodet, senior lecturer in the history of Africa at SOAS University of London, suggested that it was overdue. \u201cIt is about time, honestly,\u201d she said, adding that it was important that the papers should not just focus on a western perspective of non-British, non-European history but look at the richness and diversity of other cultures\u2019 history in their own right. \u201cUntil recently, the empire was never put into question. It is finally time that movements like \u2018Rhodes must fall\u2019 get to the UK and there is a bit more self-reflection on those issues,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say it is a good sign that it comes finally to this point, but it is not the way it will solve all those issues just to say \u2018we\u2019re done with that we introduced this\u2019. It is about the content of the course that is important.\u201d Tamaki Laycock, academic officer at the University of York\u2019s student union who brought the Why is My Curriculum White? campaign to York, said the move was positive, but that it was also important to realise that black and ethnic minorities had been pivotal throughout British history. But Vinita Damodaran, professor of south Asian history at the University of Sussex, said the move would force students outside their comfort zone and that other universities should follow suit. Damodaran added that schools should also broaden their curricula, while she stressed that it was important for universities to be proactive in hiring non-white academics and introduce black writing and women\u2019s writing to curricula. Oxford and other universities have come under attack for the small number of black undergraduates they enrol. Last year, former prime minister David Cameron criticised it for taking only 27 black students in 2014. Kehinde Andrews, associate professor in sociology at Birmingham City University, said that the compulsory paper was simply a perfunctory gesture, adding that history curricula in universities should integrate non-white history across the syllabus. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of tokenistic nonsense you always get from these kinds of institutions where it is not actually \u2018let\u2019s try and deal with the problem\u2019, it is let\u2019s try and look like we are dealing with the problem by adding \u2018you have to do a test on this\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not just an Oxford problem, this is a history problem in general,\u201d he added. Andrews said that concerns raised by those including Harvard professor Niall Ferguson that making courses more diverse could jeopardise teaching of the rise of the west or the world wars missed a fundamental point. \u201cThe idea you can teach British history without teaching about Africa, Asia, the colonies \u2013 that is the whole problem in itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Haitian revolution is as important to the development of the west as the French revolution.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
