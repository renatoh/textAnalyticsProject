The two clubs have accepted terms on a fee which could reach \u00a32.5m depending on appearances, and would make the 22-year-old the Baggies' record signing. West Brom will pay \u00a31.125m immediately, a further \u00a31.125m in 12 months' time and another \u00a3250,000 when the player makes his 75th appearance. Welsh international Koumas will head to West Brom tomorrow morning for a medical and to discus personal terms. Dundee winger Javier Artero is set to announce his retirement after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The Dens Park club have called a press conference for 9.30am tomorrow morning where they are expected to confirm the Spaniard's decision. The 27-year-old was diagnosed with the illness, which affects the nervous system, last September after falling ill before the first game of the season against Dundee United. But the former Real Madrid man has struggled to maintain the fitness levels he has become accustomed to. Artero did return to the first team set-up under former manager Ivano Bonetti in November against Hearts but has rarely featured since. All of Scotland's Euro 2004 qualifying matches away from home will be shown live on BBC Scotland. The channel have already announced plans to show the Scotland-Germany match on September 10 next year. But live coverage of all the other away ties will now be available on television and radio as well, starting with the visit to the Faroe Islands on September 7. That game is followed by Iceland in Reykjavik on October 12 before the Scots head for Vilnius in April 2003 to take on Lithuania. Robbie Keane has denied he is involved in transfer talks with Tottenham and has been included in Terry Venables' squad for tonight's game against Sunderland at Elland Road. Leeds officials spoke to the Republic of Ireland international today and pointed out that no fee had been agreed with Tottenham, and Keane assured them he had not spoken to the London club. Keane aims to leave before the transfer window closes on Saturday night because he wants regular first-team football. Charlton have called for an overhaul of the appeals system to Premiership red cards. The club are contesting Graham Barber's decision to send off Paul Konchesky for an alleged elbow on Chelsea midfielder Enrique de Lucas on the opening day of the season. A day after Konchesky's dismissal, Birmingham's Aliou Cisse was sent off at Highbury, but his potential ban was rescinded two days after Birmingham's defeat. But Konchesky has been kept waiting until tomorrow, when he meets referee Barber at a hearing in Coventry. \"I believe it is time to look at the way in which appeals against dismissals are handled,\" said Addicks chief executive Peter Varney. \"Some decisions are overturned on the Monday after the match and more often than not it appears to be those that have been most heavily criticised on the television. In other cases, as with Paul, you have to wait nearly two weeks.\" Southend have signed former Bristol City defender Tom Jordan on a month-to-month contract after he impressed during a spell on trial with the reserves. The 21-year-old, whose father Joe played for Leeds United, Manchester United and Scotland in the 1970s, has figured in both second-string games so far, and is eager to compete for a first-team place at Roots Hall. Bolton have today signed former Tottenham and Crystal Palace striker Chris Armstrong, who has been without a club after being released from White Hart Lane in the summer. The 31-year-old Armstrong has signed a short-term deal after passing a medical at the Reebok Stadium. \"With the transfer deadline coming at the weekend it was vitally important to bolster our squad,\" manager Sam Allardyce told the club's website, www.bwfc.co.uk. \"I am absolutely delighted to be bringing Chris here. He is a highly experienced player with a marvellous track record of scoring goals in the top flight. \"At the moment he is about six to eight weeks behind the rest of the squad in terms of fitness but will become an integral part of the team.\" Newcastle-born Armstrong began his career with Wrexham in 1989 before moving to Millwall and then Crystal Palace. He joined Spurs in 1995 for \u00a34.5m, appearing in 141 league games and scoring 48 goals. Hugh Dallas will officiate at Friday's European Super Cup final between Real Madrid and Feyenoord. The game will be the Scottish World Cup referee's last major final in Europe as he steps down from the Fifa list at the end of the year. The Lanarkshire official has previously refereed the 1999 Uefa Cup final and was fourth official at the World Cup final this year. Dallas is joined by assistant referees Wilson Irvine and David Doig for Friday's game, while Stuart Dougal will act as fourth official."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
