As Britain's obesity epidemic shows no sign of abating, it's never been more important for people to have access to good quality, safe and attractive parks where they can take part in free, enjoyable and healthy activities. Parks don't just benefit physical health - mental health charity Mind published a study earlier this year looking at how exercise in green surroundings affects people's mental health, and the results were unambiguous. 71% reported decreased levels of depression after a walk in green space, and 90% had increased self-esteem. These findings take on extra importance in today's world where we hear alarming reports of the state of our children's mental wellbeing \u2013 earlier this year Unicef claimed that British children are the unhappiest in the Western world. There's no doubt that parks and green spaces will become increasingly important in the future as more densely populated cities mean that fewer of us have access to gardens and private green space in which to relax and unwind. As our climate changes, longer, hotter summers will mean that people will want to spend more time outside, so I envisage parks once again taking their place at the heart of our communities. Some predict that the British lifestyle will become more Mediterranean, with growing emphasis on outdoor, communal activities \u2013 and for these parks are surely the best venue that we have. I envisage outdoor cinema, outdoor concerts and al fresco dining. Similarly, if the trend towards more flexible working patterns continues, and a warmer climate blurs the distinction between indoor and outdoor lifestyles, I see no reason why parks might not serve as outdoor, communal offices. Technology can help facilitate this - Abbey Gardens in Suffolk already features an \"internet bench\" where park users can plug in their laptops and access the internet. Increased usage will undoubtedly bring challenges for local authorities \u2013 park users need facilities, and budget cuts over the past two decades have meant that many parks are now sadly lacking in the most basic amenities. There will need to be more and better toilets, play and catering facilities, and we live longer, there will need to be significantly improved facilities for the elderly. Climate change will bring its own challenges for landscape designers and park managers. Shade will become increasingly important, so shelters and denser planting will be essential. Sustainability will become ever more important reflected in more resilient planting, composting, water saving and energy production measures. Not only will parks of the future have a far reaching effect on quality of life and wellbeing, they may also play an important role in protecting our cities from flash flooding - parks can provide vital storm water drainage storage. There will be interesting design opportunities to incorporate runoff - and perhaps our parks could take inspiration from Sydney Olympic Park and recycle and treat excess water to use, for example, for park toilets. There is, however, real concern that all these changes will require huge investment, both capital and revenue, at a time when park budgets are generally in decline. It needs to be recognised, and soon, that parks provide the key to improving quality of life of town and city dwellers as climate change takes hold. Local authorities need to reassess what is important to their communities and start to reprioritise spending and begin to explore innovative ways of funding and delivering parks. \u00b7 Paul Bramhill is chief executive of GreenSpace, which today hosts the Pushing Parks Forward conference"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
