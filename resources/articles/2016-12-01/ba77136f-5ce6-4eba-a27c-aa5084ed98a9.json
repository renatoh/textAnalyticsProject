However, there was a chink of light for Russia, with Rune Andersen, the Norwegian heading the IAAF\u2019s taskforce, conceding that Russian Athletics had started making structural reforms after being banned from the Olympics in June. \u201cRusaf has made further progress since June, including anti-doping education modules and securing the cooperation of the Russian criminal authorities and parliament in criminalising the supply of doping products,\u201d Andersen told a news conference. \u201cBut one of the key remaining issues is how to demonstrate the IAAF and Rusada [Russian Anti-Doping] will be able to carry out testing without interference, which is a key part of their reinstatement. The taskforce will go to Moscow in January to assess the response to part two of the McLaren report on 9 December and to monitor progress.\u201d Andersen said the taskforce would report back to the IAAF\u2019s council in February, when it hoped to \u201cidentify a clear road map\u201d for Russia\u2019s return but he declined to give any further likely timeframe. Sebastian Coe, the IAAF president, agreed with Andersen\u2019s evaluation but said he would not be making any judgments about whether there had been a cultural shift in Russia. \u201cWhat I am satisfied with is that we are making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be recognised that this is a system that cataclysmically failed clean athletes.\u201d Earlier the Russia president Vladimir Putin used his state of the nation address to say he thought effective measures would be in place early in the new year. \u201cI am sure the so-called doping scandal will allow us to create the most advanced system of righting this evil in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cI assume the national programme of counteracting doping will be ready as early as the beginning of next year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
