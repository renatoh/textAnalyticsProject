Their retro-borrowings are bound to earn them a few rotten tomatoes, since at various times they can morph into anybody from Kim Wilde to the Cars and Garbage. Certainly they're sugary on top, with tunes like Any Other Girl, Disco Hurts or 8-9-10 bristling with hooks apparently designed by scientists to create a psychological dependency in the listener, while singer Stine Jacobsen appears to have been grown from a test-tube labelled \"Helena Christensen\". Their advantage is that they're coming at all this stuff from a typically deadpan Scandinavian perspective, which imparts a smattering of ironic detachment. Amusing in small doses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
