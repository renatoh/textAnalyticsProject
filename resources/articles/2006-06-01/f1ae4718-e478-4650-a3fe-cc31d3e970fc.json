Thought you might drag your sorry self to this page. The last time I expressed a view, you disagreed with it. But, then, you are a halfwit. Welcome to the brave new world, where low-grade abuse qualifies as legitimate debate. London has moved into this era of unfettered comment and its mayor, Ken Livingstone, is at the vanguard. Can it be right that the man elected to speak for Londoners should rebuke the Reuben Brothers, a pair of Jewish property developers, by suggesting that they \"go back to Iran and try their luck with the ayatollahs\"? Is it acceptable for the mayor to equate a Jewish newspaper reporter with a Nazi concentration camp guard or to describe the US ambassador - who has failed to pay the congestion charge - as a \"chiselling little crook\"? According to Ken, it is. That also seems to be the general public view. Since he made those comments, there has been no backlash. In the case of the Reuben Brothers, those who set the standards for public life appear to endorse this behaviour too. On Monday, the monitoring officer for the Greater London Authority concluded that when the mayor told the brothers - both British citizens - to \"go back to Iran\" if they didn't like the way we do things here, he was merely contrasting the scope available for dissension in our fine democracy with the lack of transparent process the brothers might discover were they to lodge their planning applications in Tehran. Both brothers are of Iraqi extraction, not Iranian, but that's a mere detail. Peter Keith-Lucas, the lawyer conducting the investigation, said: \"Ken Livingstone's intention was to send a clear message that the public authorities would act robustly, in accordance with their legal rights. [His] criticisms were proportionate to this purpose.\" The first of these observations is obviously right. Ken was concerned about the effect their behaviour might have on the construction of the Olympic site. But what of the second observation? Does anyone other than Mr Keith-Lucas and the mayor himself really believe his criticisms were proportionate? He's no racist and he is a master of the colourful, occasionally overblown expression, but on that occasion he sounded dangerously like the mayor as Alf Garnett. Still it worked for him and perhaps the message from the monitoring officer is that anything goes. But would that be what we want? Can public figures continue to harrumph about the need for \"respect\" and then address each other like sailors on shore leave. Surely we also want those who lead to reflect the best of us rather than the worst. The mayor says he should be able to say anything he likes so long as he remains within the law. He says those are the parameters of free speech that should also apply to others. He is right when he says that there are problems with the present disciplinary process, which allows for elected officials to be deposed by unelected committees rather than their peers and the people who voted for them. This threat hovers over him still after the adjudication panel's decision to suspend him for his comments to the Jewish reporter. But nothing would be achieved - other than rudeness and incivility on a grand scale - if we followed his logic, for this would mean the only worthwhile gauge of civilised behaviour would be the laws we pass as legal restrictions of the last resort. There must be a midpoint between the bland approach that turns many off politics and blowtorching that the monitoring officer seems to have endorsed. The mayor is a gifted man with a funny turn of phrase. But with the language he employed to address the Reuben brothers, he got it wrong. The monitoring officer should have told him so. hugh.muir@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
