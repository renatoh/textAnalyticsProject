Wow. Excellent idea. I know that might seem like an awful lot of money. Might it not do more good for the oil industry's image if used to drop the price of gas? Not really. When you think about the fact that the five biggest US oil companies took in almost $60 billion in profits in the first half of 2006 alone (pdf), it's easy to see that $100 million is chump change, indeed. Way less than a penny a gallon. Hearing this story, I've been tormented and sleepless, trying to imagine how such a campaign might take shape. When I could take it no more, I started asking around my super inside unnamed sources in the corridors of power. It's good to be as well connected as I am, because I was able to come up with a super secret tape recording of a \"spitballing\" session between industry execs and PR honchos for the campaign. What follows is a verbatim transcript. PR HONCHO #1: We've prepared a list of what we call \"image downers\" as a way of kicking things off, OK? OIL EXEC #1: Shoot. PR HONCHO #1: Well, our research tells us that the number one issue the American Public has with the oil industry is price gouging. OIL EXEC #2 (insulted): What do they mean by that? PR EXEC #1: We've found is that the general perception is you guys just make up the prices and use the wars and disasters as excuses to get as much as you can. OIL EXEC #2: Oh, that. Can't we hit them with some real numbers? PR HONCHO#2: You mean the 260% the price of gas has gone up since Bush came into office? Or the 357 billion in profits you guys made over that 5 years? OIL EXEC #1: Oh, that. So ... got some ideas on how to deal with it? PR HONCHO #1: We thought something kind of light, you know? PR HONCHO #2: Humorous. Like: Have you ever thought about all the things that are MORE than 357 billion? PR HONCHO #1: Like, grains of sand on the planet? PR HONCHO #2: Or atoms in the universe? PR INTERN (squeaky voice): Or dollars spent on the war in Iraq? Silence. OIL EXEC #1 (not convinced): I don't know. What's next? PR HONCHO #1: Well, there's still a lot of negatives around from the Valdez thing. OIL EXEC #2: Oh please, that's so 90s. PR HONCHO #2: It was actually '89, and there's this perception that you guys still haven't paid for the clean up. OIL EXEC #1: Haven't they seen those detergent ads where the cute little penguiny things get cleaned up? Happy ending! What's the problem? PR HONCHO #1: Seems that's creating even more sympathy for the birds, keeping the whole thing alive. And Happy Feet is killing us. OIL EXEC #1: Damn! What's next? PR HONCHO #1: Let me see ... [reads] \"Responsibility for reckless wars of conquest leading to the death and/or dismemberment of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people as well as unimaginable immiseration of the local populace as a whole, and the stimulation of a civil war with catastrophic consequences for the country, the region, and, likely, the world.\" OIL EXEC #2: Come on, it's just a bunch of Arabs. Next? PR HONCHO #1: \"Responsibility for reckless wars of conquest leading to the death and/or dismemberment of tens of thousands of Americans.\" OIL EXEC #1: Well, now, that's a serious problem. But how is it our fault? The war is about freedom, not oil. OIL EXEC #2: I thought we were going with \"It's about terrorism, not oil.\" The freedom thing wasn't flying. OIL EXEC #1: Right. That's what I meant. \"Terrorism, not oil.\" PR HONCHO #1: Yeah, thing is, it says here there's a growing perception that the war is increasing the threat of terrorism, and everyone knows it's really about oil. PR INTERN (squeaky voice): And world domination. PR HONCHO #1: OK, and world domination, but everyone knows that's really about oil, too. PR HONCHO #2: Yeah. Silence. PR INTERN (squeaky voice): What if we sponsor an ad campaign for peace? More silence. PR HONCHO #2: It's so crazy it just might work! Instead of War for Oil ... Oil for Peace. We responsibly call for an immediate, phased, gradual redeployment of troops. OIL EXEC #1: Redeployment where? PR HONCHO #2: Saudi Arabia? OIL EXEC #1: Ouch. Gonna make another shitload of trouble for the House of Saud. PR HONCHO #1: Lebanon? OIL EXEC #2: Double ouch. That place has a bad stink, you know? PR HONCHO #1: Syria and Iran are non starters. Kuwait? OIL EXEC #1: Nice nostalgic touch to that. OIL EXEC #2: I don't know. Been there, done that. PR INTERN (squeaky voice): How about behind giant screens in the desert? PR HONCHO #1 (envisioning): An immediate, phased gradual redeployment of troops behind giant screens in the desert. OIL EXEC #1: That would put us further out than the Democratic Leadership. PR HONCHO #2: Maybe we should drop the \"immediate\" thing. PR HONCHO #1: No, we want to be bold. Beyond party labels. \"Immediate gradual phased.\" OIL EXEC #1: OK, let's put that down as a possible. Next? PR HONCHO #1: Global warming. OIL EXECS #1 AND #2 groan audibly. PR HONCHO #1: There is a growing perception that ... excuse me ... [reads] \"The world's continued use of fossil fuels, of which the US uses 25 %, or more than five times its percentage of the world population, is almost certainly leading to massive destruction of the earth's ecology and a collapse of civilization as we know it.\" Silence. OIL EXEC #1: Well, first of all ... What's so great about civilization as we know it? Can't we do something with that? PR HONCHO #1: Maybe! Such a collapse might lead to something like the Renaissance. Isn't that what happened the last time there was a collapse of known civilization? PR HONCHO #2: Contributions from large oil companies could sponsor some of the high culture activities sure to be a part of it, further enhancing the image of the industry. PR HONCHO #1: Yeah, yeah ... the Sistine Chapel brought to you by ExxonMobil kind of a thing. PR HONCHO #2: Course we're talking a few hundred years down the road. PR HONCHO #1: It's good to see the big picture. \"We're planning for your future.\" OIL EXEC #1: Put it down as a possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
