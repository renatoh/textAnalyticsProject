We support around 3,000 people who have been bereaved through homicide, and receive core funding from the Ministry of Justice. We provide input on many of the FLO courses around the country, giving police officers the opportunity to ask bereaved people searching questions in relation to carrying out the FLO role before they are deployed to a newly bereaved family. In addition we provide input on courses for new detectives and senior investigating officers. Nearly 19 years ago I came home to find my husband of 25 years crying into the telephone and saying: \"No, please God no!\" It was a call to tell us that our 22-year-old daughter was dead. Thankfully, with the advent of FLOs, no family should have to hear the news of a sudden and traumatic death the way we did.
