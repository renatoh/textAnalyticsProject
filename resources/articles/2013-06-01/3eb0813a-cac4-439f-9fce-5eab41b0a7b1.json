Which? said the Ofgem proposals, to be confirmed on Friday, were \"fundamentally flawed\" and could force consumers into paying higher household energy costs than necessary. \"As Ofgem continues to plough ahead, ignoring what works for consumers, we call on the prime minister to intervene again and make good his promise to help hard-pressed households with their energy costs,\" said Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?. \"Energy prices are the biggest worry for consumers and our research shows overwhelmingly that people find it easier to spot the cheapest deal for them when prices are presented clearly, simply and consistently \u2013 just like on the petrol station forecourt,\" he added. Ofgem is to revealon Friday that it will introduce into licence conditions that energy companies must provide four core tariffs in a bid to cut down on the huge number that are currently available and which often baffle customers. Ofgem is also demanding that utilities provide clear information about the cheapest tariff on offer as well as providing stronger protections for those on fixed-price contracts. Andrew Wright, senior partner for markets at Ofgem, said the new reforms \u2013 originally outlined last autumn \u2013 were \"the blueprint for the simpler, clearer and fairer energy market that consumers deserve. This will provide them with the choices they want alongside the simplicity they need.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
