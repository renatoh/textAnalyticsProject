A composite score featuring music by David Byrne weaves together fragments from six different works. \u00b7 Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne (0191-230 5151), tonight and Saturday Theatre The Seafarer Conor McPherson's unsettling play, set on Christmas Eve, about a group of brothers and old drinking buddies who are invited to sup with the devil. One of them may be playing for his soul. A sparky, suspenseful evening with a great cast. \u00b7 Theatre Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne (0870 905 5060), until Saturday Pop Faithless Unaffected by the vagaries of fashion, Britain's multi-platinum purveyors of stadium house embark on their umpteenth tour of the nation's cattlesheds. You could argue that what Faithless do lacks subtlety, but it's hard to deny their ability to reach row ZZ of a packed arena. \u00b7 Nottingham Arena (0870 121 0123), Saturday Classical Dallapiccola Not all the composers featured in the BBC Philharmonic's Neglected Geniuses series seem to deserve the description, but Luigi Dallapiccola does; even his centenary in 2004 brought painfully few performances of his austere yet profoundly lyrical music. Gianandrea Noseda begins his concert with one of the major orchestral works: the Variations Dallapiccola wrote in 1954 as an arrangement of a set of piano pieces composed for his daughter. \u00b7 Bridgewater Hall, Manchester (0161-907 9000), Saturday Jazz Branford Marsalis Quartet The sax-playing Marsalis brother's group has been at the top of the league for more than six years, with a repertoire spanning Coltrane-ish fire and even Henry Purcell's O Solitude. \u00b7 The Sage, Gateshead (0191-443 4661), Sunday Film The Family Friend Terrifically stylish movie from the maker of The Consequences of Love. The film is set in Italy and concerns an ageing moneylender who divides his time between exploiting his \"clients\" and looking after his bedridden mother. \u00b7 On national release Dance Rambert Dance Company The spring tour offers rich pickings from their current repertory. Mold's programme includes a revival of Merce Cunningham's zen-like classic Pond Way, featuring a score by Brian Eno, plus Mark Baldwin's strange revisiting of Andr\u00e9e Howard's Lady Into Fox. \u00b7 Clwyd Theatr Cymru, Mold (0845 330 3565), tonight Jazz BBC Big Band and guests Gateshead jazzfest special with still-sublime veteran US Charlie Parker disciple Phil Woods, and effervescent jazz and Broadway singer Lea DeLaria, with classy BBC swing band. \u00b7 The Sage, Gateshead (0191-443 4666), tonight Theatre Kindertransport Revival of Diane Samuels' award-winning heartbreaker about nine-year-old Eva's arrival in Manchester as one of the thousands of German Jewish children sent by their parents to England during the 1930s. \u00b7 Liverpool Playhouse, (0151-709 4776), ends Saturday, then touring Pop These New Puritans Hailing from the same curious Southend scene that spawned the Horrors, These New Puritans are a more angular and awkward proposition. More bizarre still, lead singer Jack Barnett seems to have replaced Pete Doherty as the muse of Dior Homme designer Hedi Slimane. \u00b7 Stealth, Nottingham (0115-958 0672), Saturday"}, "isHosted": false}}}
