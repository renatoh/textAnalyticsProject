Gavyn Davies, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, will tell the independent interview panel that his links with the Government would make it 'difficult' if there was not a clear political division between him and his deputy. Davies, who will be interviewed this week, will admit he has donated \u00a310,000 to the Labour Party. He is a close friend of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, and is married to Brown's political secretary and powerful 'gatekeeper', Sue Nye. But a supporter of Davies, currently vice-chairman of the BBC, said: 'He is about as far from a crony as you can get.' The multi-millionaire was a Labour Party adviser and in 1999 was in charge of a review of BBC funding. One of his main recommendations, for a separate 'top-up' licence fee for digital television, was rejected. The appointment of a new BBC chairman is one of the most delicate political decisions Blair, who must ratify the interview panel's choice, will have to make this year. The decision is particularly sensitive because of the appointment as BBC director general in 1999 of Greg Dyke, who has donated \u00a350,000 to the Labour Party. That appointment was made by BBC governors who are independent of the Government. Davies will argue that linking him with the Government because of his marriage is 'old fashioned' and will say he will make decisions on broadcasting and business terms alone. If he is successful, one of the leading contenders for vice-chairman will be Sarah Hogg, head of John Major's policy unit between 1992 and 1995, who is married to the former Tory Minister Douglas Hogg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
