The rescue of that animal, saved from the Long Flat blaze by a woman using her shirt as a shield, went viral. But the bushfires have injured and displaced vast numbers of other creatures, many of which no longer have homes. Who rescues them \u2013 and what does that involve? Kristie Newton works as campaign manager for the NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service (Wires), an organisation that, in normal times, says it cares for tens of thousands of hurt or distressed animals each year. But these are not normal times. \u201cWe are completely inundated at the moment,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the biggest event we have ever dealt with.\u201d Australia\u2019s flora and fauna have evolved to coexist with fire \u2013 but not with fires of such intensity. Wires\u2019 search and rescue teams still can\u2019t access many affected areas, even as people in towns or outer suburbs report injured animals fleeing into backyards or roads. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t know what we\u2019re looking at for about a month or so, maybe longer, until we can really go in and start to get more animals out. But we\u2019ve lost a lot of habitat, so it\u2019s not only directly affecting the animals now, but will continue to affect them for years to come.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment echoed by Vickii Lett, a veteran carer with Clarence Valley Wires. She\u2019s dedicated her property in Lightning Creek near Grafton to caring for wild creatures, so much so that she takes an instant to recall just how many she\u2019s currently sheltering. \u201cI\u2019ve got three flying foxes, one koala, three \u2013 no, four! \u2013 redneck wallabies (one of which is burned), and one wallaroo. Oh, and a boobook owl.\u201d A volunteer since 1988, Lett has never experienced fires of such ferocity, affecting such a vast area. \u201cThis is man-made; we\u2019ve done it,\u201d she says. At the same time, she worries that the immediate crisis might cloak the broader wildlife emergency, the everyday devastation of deforestation and land clearing. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a wildlife carer, fairly early you realise that you might be able to fix animals, but you\u2019ve got to have somewhere to put them. They\u2019re not pets, but when I release them, I worry about every one of them. They\u2019ve got to have a home and a food supply.\u201d Wires offers a short rescue and immediate care course that equips people to work with common species. Volunteers can nominate their level of commitment. They can decide to be carers or rescuers or both \u2013 or help with various administrative tasks. Some take on additional training to specialise in particular animals \u2013 anything from koalas to venomous snakes. That\u2019s how Kristina-Lee Willis, a 29-year-old from Corindi Beach (two hours north of Port Macquarie), ended up with Teddy, the baby sugar glider. Originally, Willis wanted to rescue bats \u2013 \u201cto break down the knee-jerk reaction that \u2018ewww they\u2019re disgusting\u2019,\u201d \u2013 but the first course available focused on possums and gliders. Then, during the recent blaze, a crew clearing firebreaks on an isolated road near Glenreagh found a glider joey on the ground. \u201cIt was so sweet: this big burly bloke who was driving the dozer carried her crooked up in his arm all the way back to their base. A lady made the call to Wires and then another two gentlemen drove her to the Golden Dog pub in the middle of Glenreagh. And I took her from there.\u201d A little glider means a lot of work. Teddy \u2013 named after the dozer driver who cuddled her \u2013 only drinks a special milk formula. \u201cShe\u2019s very clever,\u201d says Willis, with maternal pride. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need a bottle. She laps at milk from the tiny little spoon or from the bottle cap.\u201d But that\u2019s just the beginning. \u201cNow she\u2019s older, she\u2019s getting little bugs like crickets and meal worms and some moths when I can catch them, though that\u2019s really tricky. And also some sap. She likes to chew on some branches and lick at blossoms as well.\u201d Teddy\u2019s gaining weight and will, with luck, make a full recovery. But she\u2019s just one animal \u2013 and so very, very many need help. At the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, the volunteers feel that strain. The facility boasts 14 intensive care units and can house up to 50 animals. Hospital president Sue Ashton worked in the corporate world before retiring to Port Macquarie two years ago, and then taking up a vacancy on the hospital board. \u201cI enjoyed my old job. But this is so satisfying \u2013 working with wild animals and seeing them rehabilitated back into the wild.\u201d Yet after the recent fires, she fears for the long-term future of the species. In places like the Lake Innes nature reserve, as many as two-thirds of wild koalas seem to have died, incinerated by the astonishing heat. Those that survived were dehydrated; many had been burned on their paws, noses and mouths. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to cut the dead skin off, bathe their wounds, then treat them with a cream for burns and bandage them,\u201d Ashton says. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them a low lactose milk supplement, for extra nutrients and hydration \u2013 some of them aren\u2019t eating leaves because their mouth is burnt. The really bad ones have gone into home care. Some might need to be fed more frequently; they need to have their noses rubbed with cream or something like that.\u201d Many of the centre\u2019s 150 volunteers currently come in almost daily, and their physical exhaustion exacerbates the toll of watching animals suffer. Burns are, after all, notoriously difficult to heal. Several of the injured koalas, including the one rescued at Long Flat, have had to be euthanised. Nicole Blums, from Brisbane\u2019s Rescue Collective, knows how shattering wildlife volunteering can be. She established her group specifically to help resource frontline carers, providing them with basic materials as well as little gifts to lift their spirits. \u201cOver the last nine days,\u201d she says, \u201cWires has received nine carloads and trailer loads of resources from us. That includes medical supplies, drugs for the animals, formulas, feeding bottles, joey pouches, bat wraps: anything that they need to be able to spend more time with the animals.\u201d A fortnight ago, her group consisted of four women; now it\u2019s grown to about 20. Like the other volunteers, she\u2019s been appalled by the fires; like them, she\u2019s been buoyed by the community response. \u201cWorking in rescue, you see a lot of bad things and you can begin to hate the human race,\u201d Blums says. \u201cBut every time we start to think it\u2019s too much, it\u2019s too heavy for our hearts, we open a box and we find a letter from one of our supporters or a drawing from one of the kids.\u201d Her voice catches slightly. \u201cThat gives us strength to know that we are making a difference and that we have so much behind us now that we can\u2019t stop.\u201d The rescue organisations need donations. They also need volunteers. But Wires\u2019 Kristie Newton stresses that it\u2019s possible for anyone to help native animals, just by taking very simple steps. \u201cIf people are in an area that\u2019s affected by fire or even by heat, if they can leave bowls of water for birds and animals, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Likewise, a cardboard box and towel kept in your car can help contain an injured animal, if it\u2019s possible to do so safely. \u201cIf you do encounter any injured animals,\u201d she says, \u201ccall your local wildlife group \u2013 and get them help as soon as possible. It really can save lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
