The firm is planning an initial public offering of less than 10% of the company at a value of $12.5bn (\u00a38bn), according to reports. In May when the company announced plans to go public, analysts were predicting values of between $20bn and $30bn. But a series of missteps by the company and stock market jitters caused by the eurozone crisis have cut into the company's plans. The three-year-old firm founded by the former music student Andrew Mason sells discounts to local businesses. By some measures it is the fast growing firm of all time and now has over 50 million subscribers in 43 countries. Last year Google offered $6bn to buy the firm but was rejected as the company seemed headed for one of the biggest IPOs in recent history. But in August regulators forced Groupon to pull an unusual accounting metric called \"adjusted consolidated segment operating income\" from its offering materials. And in September questions from the US's top financial watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission led to the firm cutting its reported revenue in half. The company cancelled plans for an IPO roadshow to court investors and its chief operating officer left the firm. The company is now expected to begin marketing a scaled back share sale next week. The move comes as a number of social media firms preparing IPOs have also reviewed their plans. Zynga, the online game developer behind CityVille, FarmVille and Words With Friends, announced plans in July for a $1bn IPO and has yet to set a date for completion. Amid the stock market turmoil, Facebook has put back plans for an IPO next year that could value it at more than $66bn. Selling a small slice of shares has proved successful for other recent tech firm IPOs, at least in the short term. Shares in LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, more than doubled on their first day of trading when the firm went public in May. The company sold an 8% stake in the IPO. Its shares are now trading below that first day \"pop\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
