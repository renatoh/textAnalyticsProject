Meanwhile his former design team, headed by new creative director and long-time Galliano collaborator Bill Gaytten, were making the final preparations to the label's spring/summer 2012 menswear collection, shown in Paris. The show was the first to be presented to the fashion industry without involvement from Galliano \u2013 the designer was sacked from the eponymous label in April. The first model swaggered out on to the catwalk with long curly hair wearing a dandyish red frock coat and hat with a jaunty feather poking from it \u2013 this seemed like a nod to the label's absent founder. Other models also resembled the designer while several suit jackets appeared worn with waistcoat and scarf but no shirt \u2013 the exact look Galliano had worn to court. Titled the \"Big Splash\", the show notes said the collection had been \"Inspired by artists and the vibrant 1960s London Pop Art Scene.\" David Hockney was one of the muses, which meant an array of arty colourful tank tops, knitted striped ties, jaunty bow ties and circular spectacles. Next came the typically scantily clad underwear section, including a flowing bird print silk dressing gown and boxer shorts. The final few looks were made up of spray-on satin trousers and tux jackets worn open with little underneath. The Galliano brand, set up in 1984, has never experienced the same critical success as the designer's tenure did at Christian Dior, which owns 91% of the Galliano house. Meanwhile many of the most profitable products, such as perfume and accessories, are produced in partnerships with other firms, licensees who effectively buy into the brand name. While the show was successful in establishing that there is life in the Galliano brand despite its founder's current misfortunes, it was noted that audience numbers had been scaled back significantly. It was also reported that various members of the British press had simply boycotted the event. Clearly it is Gaytten's task to win them back; on this evidence it's too soon to say whether he will or not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
