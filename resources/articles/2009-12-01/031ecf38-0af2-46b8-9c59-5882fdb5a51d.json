Laura Dekker, 14, who went missing on Thursday, was found today on the island of St Martin, in the Dutch Antilles, according to the Dutch news agency ANP. Bernhard Jens, a spokesman for the police in Utrecht, her home town, said investigators were not treating the case as a crime. The Dutch public broadcaster NOS said Dekker left a note for her father before disappearing, but did not reveal its contents. Dekker, the child of two sailing enthusiasts who separated six years after she was born on their yacht in New Zealand, had her attempt to break the world record blocked in October. Citing concerns about her safety and schooling, the Utrecht district court placed her under the guardianship of local welfare authorities. Although she remained living with her father, who was in favour of her undertaking the sea challenge, she and her parents were required to get the approval of child protection officials for any future trips, the court ruled. The judgment meant she could not leave the country until July, without their approval. Dekker, who had spoken fervently of her desire to set off on a two-year voyage which would beat the record currently held by Mike Perham, a 17-year-old Briton, was said by a family spokeswoman to be have been \"disappointed\" by the court's ruling. As she has dual Dutch and New Zealand nationality, she was quoted as saying she was considering setting sail from New Zealand. Jens told journalists that Dekker's boat, Guppy, was still moored at its usual place. He refused to confirm a report in the Dutch press that she withdrew \u20ac3,500 from her bank account days before she disappeared. A spokesperson for the family, Mariska Woertman, said Dekker left a letter addressed to her father, but refused to elaborate on its content. Her father has emerged as a controversial figure in the saga. When his daughter \u2013 then 13 \u2013 was picked up by British police in the port of Lowestoft in May, after sailing alone from the Netherlands, he initially refused to come and collect her, insisting she was capable of returning home in her boat. The teenager's mother has expressed more caution about the scheme, saying she believes Laura might still be too young to face the mental and physical stress of such an endeavour. In its October ruling, the court accepted that her sailing skills were adequate and that the undertaking would not harm her emotional development. But it insisted there were concerns about her safety and education."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
