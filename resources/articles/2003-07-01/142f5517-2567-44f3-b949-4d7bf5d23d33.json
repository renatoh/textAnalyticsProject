But with a shortage of hotels in the area - Sandwich has only one, the Bell - the huge influx of visitors has placed a premium on high-quality billets on and around the Isle of Thanet. The official R&amp;A letting agents, GW Finn &amp; Sons, have let more than 200 properties, ranging from \u00a3700 (a caravan) to more than \u00a315,000 (Tiger-friendly digs). Homeowners in the Troon area, hoping to attract Woods and co during next year's Open, should pay heed to the advice of Jane Forbes, Finn's Open accommodation manager. \"You have to have very high standards of accommodation if you want to get a player staying, but without doubt the most important two things are power showers and Sky TV. American players won't stay anywhere that hasn't got them,\" she said. \u0095Saga Holidays, purveyors of luxury cruises to holidaymakers of a certain age, have taken up residence in a large sales office in the middle of the tented village. Open diary wonders if the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, makers of Viagra and whose factory overlooks the course, have not missed a trick by failing to take a slot next door to supply the Saga louts for their holidays. \u0095Security at Royal St George's is still not up to scratch, despite organisers pledging to raise their game following events on Tuesday when His Tigerness was subjected to what eyewitnesses described as \"severe jostling\" as he left the 18th green. Yesterday Nick Faldo was manhandled by a gang of teenage autograph hunters, egged on no doubt by fathers who can recall his last major victory, as he made his way from the 3rd green to the 4th tee. Marshals promised to be quicker with the ropes today. \u0095Faldo is one of three Open champions - Woods and Els are the others - who have signed the table behind which the players sit to give their press conferences. The furniture company who provide all the press-room kit free of charge hope that others will add their names as the week goes on, but insist the table will not end up for sale on eBay. \u0095Colin Montgomerie may have new allies in his crusade against photographers. Snappers have often caused the Scot to do his pieces, a habit he shares with Tiger Woods, who was followed on his practice round on Tuesday by three identically clad representatives of Nike. One of them took it upon himself to caution the accompanying photographers against premature shutter action, a move that has left the smudgers threatening all-out war and has seen the sponsors dubbed \"The Nike Nazis\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
