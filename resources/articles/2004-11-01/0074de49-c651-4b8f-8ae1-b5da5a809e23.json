Persistent poverty leaves millions of people hungry every day in Africa and south and east Asia. The international charity Concern, whose mission is 'working for a world where nobody lives in fear, poverty or oppression', is striving to provide both long-term and emergency relief in 27 of the world's poorest countries. Founded in 1968 in response to famine in Biafra, it has since become recognised for its creative approach to tackling both the causes and results of hunger. Over the next five weeks The Observer, the Guardian, Guardian Weekly and GuardianUnlimited will be joining forces to report on projects run by Concern in Ethiopia, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, East Timor, India, Somalia, south Sudan, Darfur in western Sudan and Bangladesh. Concern's chief executive, Tom Arnold, serves on the United Nations Task Force on Hunger, which keeps pressure on governments to fulfil their commitments to goals set by the international community in 2000. One of these is to halve by 2015 the number of people living in extreme poverty and suffering from hunger. Your donations will help make that difference. In this country, it is all too easy to overlook vulnerable elderly people. They are often living in the most deprived areas of our towns and cities; they will probably be over 75 and they are more likely to be women. If they are from an ethnic minority, or disabled, their chances of becoming isolated increase. Often it is a local voluntary organisation that identifies those in need and provides them with the means to live a longer, more meaningful life. Volunteers help the elderly in all manner of ways: from running healthy eating cafes to providing specialist advice, from running health awareness programmes to helping with unclaimed benefits. It's all about improving the quality of life for our ageing population. The specialist charity research organisation Philanthropy Capital has identified eight small, local care societies and a national helpline where it believes your donations will have the greatest effect. Over the next five weeks we will be reporting on these projects in Swansea, Glasgow, Manchester, Dumfries, Liverpool, Newcastle and in the London areas of Newham and Tower Hamlets. Evans sets out his stall for the Observer appeal How last year's record sum raised was spent Generous readers last year donated a record \u00a3844,836 to our Christmas appeal for the work of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res abroad and for charities tackling domestic violence in this country. Thousands of women have been helped over the past year as a result of the \u00a3272,000 which readers decided should go to our chosen nine domestic charities. The seven smaller charities each received 10 per cent of the overall fund, while the national charities Women's Aid and Refuge were given a combined total of \u00a381,636 to help launch the first jointly-run 24-hour national freephone helpline. 'Two women a week are murdered by a partner or former partner, meaning support such as yours is literally life-saving for some women,' said Refuge. Advance, in west London, used its cash injection to support 160 women through criminal court cases and help 53 more to get non-molestation orders. The organisation also trained 33 magistrates and district judges to ensure they have a better understanding of the fears women have about coming to court and facing their abuser. Advance also used funds from the appeal as leverage to win further financial support from other organisations. The money received by Leeds-based Halt helped it to cope with more than 1,000 cases dealing with court protection orders, Children's Act orders and divorce and financial settlements. The Haven in Wolverhampton refurbished its main advice centre, which provides specialist support skills needed to help women moving out of hostels and back into the community. The Phoenix Project in Bolton and the Montgomeryshire Family Crisis Centre used a portion of their funding to develop projects in schools. Skilled workers from the Welsh charity visit schools to work with teachers to open up the issue of domestic violence and to give children who are experiencing or witnessing domestic abuse the chance to come forward. The new national helpline launched by Refuge and Women's Aid has made a dramatic difference to the lives of hundreds of women over the past year. Previously each charity had offered its own service. But even with funding from readers and other donors, the demand is still far exceeding resources. In the nine months to August 2004, the helpline received 175,485 calls but could answer only 50,303. This is in part because each phone call on average lasts more than an hour. Apart from the phone line, the two charities created a computerised database which details space availability in all UK refuges. In the past, helpline workers had to telephone each refuge each morning to find out about availability of rooms. While the money donated has allowed all nine charities to provide much-needed services, it has also given a fillip to the staff and volunteers. 'The donations allowed for so much and gave so many advantages,' said Jackie Richardson, director of the Montgomeryshire Family Crisis Centre. 'Workers were given confidence and self-esteem knowing that so many readers had so much faith in a small charity. It has also given staff great job satisfaction from seeing their clients reclaim their lives.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
