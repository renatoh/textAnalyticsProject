The latest move? The company is now accepting submissions for iPad applications to be released on April 3, the date when the gadget starts shipping. If developers submit their wares in the next week (the deadline is actually Saturday 27th of March), they'll get told whether they pass Apple's approval process - with an eye to being available through iTunes to iPad owners on day one. There are a few interesting aspects here, not least the fact that the rather arbitrary approvals process used by the iTunes store has come in for plenty of criticism recently. But there's more potential trouble on the horizon, too. With more than 100,000 iPhone apps, and many developers working on new iPad versions, the company could easily be inundated with programs to approve. Is Apple suggesting it will screen them all before launch? Even then, that's not all that's going on in Cupertino at the moment. We know Apple's an incredibly secretive company, but as BusinessWeek reports, those who actually have access to an iPad (not simply to the emulator software that many developers are using) are forced to sign a series of demanding agreements and implement extremely particular security arrangements before Apple will play ball. Would-be testers of the tablet-style computer, due to be released Apr. 3, must promise to keep it isolated in a room with blacked-out windows, according to four people familiar with the more than 10-page pact that bars partners from disclosing information about the iPad. To ensure that it can't be removed, the iPad must also remain tethered to a fixed object, said the people, who asked not to be named because their plans for the iPad have not been made public. Apple (AAPL) won't send out an iPad until potential partners send photographic evidence that they've complied. Will this stop more information leaking out ahead of the launch? Will Apple manage to control iPad apps without incident? I have a feeling we'll be coming back to this in the next couple of weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
