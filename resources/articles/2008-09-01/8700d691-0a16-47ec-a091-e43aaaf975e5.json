No surprise: the crime movie is by far the most popular genre on these shores. Sweden has produced more than a dozen Kurt Wallander features - the diabetic inspector created by writer Henning Mankell (also popular in the UK). The latest offering from Denmark is Terribly Happy, a thriller about a village constable struggling with the skeletons in his closet. In the country where I live, Norway, we've already had two features in less a year about Varg Veum, a bearded (and quite dashing) private eye solving cases in the coastal city of Bergen, with three more movies expected in the coming year. For people here, Insomnia was not a crime drama starring Al Pacino as a bleary-eyed cop wandering the streets of an Alaskan town. It was a 1997 thriller starring a bone-chillling Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd wandering sleepless in the Norwegian Arctic town of Troms\u00f8. Christopher Nolan remade it for an international audience. The common thread among all these movies is of crimes shattering the fabric of quiet, peaceful communities. They are the Nordic versions of Miss Marple and Midsomer Murders, but with one crucial difference: film-makers here make their movies seriously dark and brooding. That lush green fjord where you think you will enjoy a nice picnic? Under the light of a Scando cinematographer, it becomes a place of torment where serial killers prey on their victims and untold horrors lurk beneath the waters. The weather helps of course: when parts of these countries are bathed in 24-hour darkness for months on end, it helps create that \"dark and stormy night\" feel - that favourite clich\u00e9 of crime writers. Crime movies are a staple everywhere, of course. But my feeling is that the genre is particularly popular in Nordic countries because these are really safe societies, with very little crime. The safer people feel, the more they need to give themselves the heebie jeebies. It's like a reading And Then There Were None at home by a fire, alone at night: you need to scare yourself a little to feel really comfy. Some Scando crime movies have even riffed on the lack of violence. The best was Kops, a 2003 comedy about police officers in small town Sweden who, realising their police station is going to be shut down because there are no crimes to solve, start robbing corner shops. I have always wondered whether Simon Pegg saw it before making Hot Fuzz. What's good enough for Christopher Nolan..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
