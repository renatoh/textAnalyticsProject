When I got back to London I went to see Sid Watkins [the FIA medical delegate] on the Tuesday after the accident. That day I saw five people in HMV who came up to me and said: 'You OK?' It was strange.\" He survived unscathed to pursue his ultimate ambition and he does not mince his words in defining it. \"I believe I can be world champion,\" he said. \"If I didn't believe it I wouldn't be here. That's the whole point of being in the formula one business.\" Button has certainly come a long way since his debut season with the Williams team in 2000. He was bundled aside there in favour of the dynamic Juan Pablo Montoya and spent the next two seasons marking time in the Renault squad, where he never quite seemed to be the flavour of the month in the mind of its colourful team principal Flavio Briatore. The bright, young driver, who finished fifth in his first British grand prix at Silverstone, seemed in danger of being swallowed up in the midfield ruck - another promising new boy who did not make the grade. But this year's switch to BAR-Honda has seen a more mature and focused Button regaining his momentum, even though the best result he has managed so far is a strong fourth place in the Austrian grand prix behind Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Rubens Barrichello. Although Button has scored a psychological victory by gaining the upper hand over his more experienced team-mate Jacques Villeneuve, the 1997 world champion, he has yet to score his first top-three finish and gain a place on the grand prix podium. And he knows that in his home race at Silverstone on Sunday it will be difficult to break that particular duck. \"Obviously when it came down to choosing a team to be with in 2003 it was very difficult because everybody is going to say that they're going to be the next world champions,\" he said. \"It just sounded very interesting, not so much for this year, but for the long term. Also being the only team that would have Honda power was again interesting for the future, but again you never know how good it's going to be. You always have to have some risk.\" Button also felt that BAR offered an environment in which his talent could blossom, free from the political uncertainties of being a Williams or a Renault driver. \"The 2000 season had been a very difficult one,\" he said. \"I was very inexperienced and didn't really know how to set up a racing car, having only driven in formula Ford and one year in formula three. \"So at Williams I didn't have much [set-up] work at all. The car was very easy to drive and the engineers wouldn't really let me change that much, a case of 'don't touch', and in 2001, with Renault, I really found it very difficult with a very hard car. In 2002 I had a lot more experience but still I didn't feel 100% confident.\" Dave Richards, the BAR-Honda team principal, said he had no doubts about recruiting Button at a time when he was frustrated by the \u00a313m contract with Jacques Villeneuve that he had inherited from his predecessor Craig Pollock. Pollock, of course, had been not only the BAR team principal but also the manager of Canadian driver. Listening to Richards it would seem he has the perfect driver for Silverstone on Sunday. \"From my point of view clearly I needed to bring some new blood into the team,\" he said. \"I needed someone young who would motivate the team. I needed somebody who would raise expectations. And a British driver is very motivational, you can't get away from this nationalistic, patriotic pride. \"So I fundamentally believed this was important for the whole morale of the team. Then you needed somebody with a great personality, which Jenson has got, and the ability to develop.\" As far as the relationship with Villeneuve is concerned, Button, a decade his junior, is suitably relaxed and laid-back. \"We get on fine,\" he said, shrugging off the rumours of initial tension between the two men. Villeneuve, who initially criticised Button for being over-hyped by the media, has diplomatically amended his stance. \"Our relationship is quite good now,\" he said. \"It's been a hard season. When things are easy you end up fighting each other and that's where relationships go wrong. Jenson has been quick, which is good. He's done a good job with the equipment we have.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
