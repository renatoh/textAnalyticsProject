Dastyari said his position had become untenable in the wake of further revelations regarding his contact with Huang Xiangmo, a donor with links to China\u2019s ruling communist regime, which forced his first demotion in 2016. \u201cToday, after much reflection, I\u2019ve decided that the best service I can render to the federal parliamentary Labor party is to not return to the Senate in 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not reached this decision lightly. But in my deliberations, I\u2019ve been guided by my Labor values, which tell me that I should leave if my ongoing presence detracts from the pursuit of Labor\u2019s mission. It is evident to me we are at that point, so I will spare the party any further distraction.\u201d Dastyari said he was quitting so the party could focus on the next election but said he left with his integrity intact. \u201cI love the Labor party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has always given me more than I\u2019d given back. I know Australia needs a Labor government and I refuse to let my personal situation put that prospect at risk. \u201cI have always put the pursuit of the Labor cause first. Reflecting on the events which led to my decision, I leave knowing that I\u2019ve always honoured my parliamentary oath. I\u2019ve always acted with integrity, and I remain a loyal, patriotic Australian. \u201cMy parents, Ella and Nasser, fled a war-torn Iran, so that they could, like so many migrants, start a new life here as Australians. I\u2019m also proud of my achievements as an Australian senator.\u201d Dastyari said he would work with the party\u2019s New South Wales branch to \u201ccoordinate\u201d his departure, with Kristina Keneally already considered a frontrunner to replace him if she fails to win the Bennelong byelection on Saturday. He did not take questions. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, had been under increasing pressure to intervene and bring an end to the Dastyari controversy, which has overshadowed Labor\u2019s attempts to win Bennelong. In a statement released moments after Dastyari left his press conference, Shorten said he had been told on Tuesday morning of the 34-year-old\u2019s plans and \u201ctold him I thought this was the right decision\u201d. \u201cSam Dastyari is a good, decent and loyal Australian, and an effective parliamentarian, but his judgment has let him down and now he has paid the heaviest price,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cSam can be proud of what he has achieved during his time as a senator \u2026 \u201cSam is also a talented and tireless campaigner \u2013 his passion, organising skills and boundless good humour has engaged a new generation of progressive activists. \u201cI am sure Sam will continue to make a valuable contribution to our country in whatever he chooses to do.\u201d For the second time in less than a year, Shorten was forced to stand Dastyari down from his additional parliamentary responsibilities, after revelations, first published in Fairfax Media, that the NSW senator had warned Huang he was probably under counter-intelligence surveillance in one of their last meetings. It was later revealed that Dastyari\u2019s claim of an \u201coff-the-cuff\u201d press conference where he contradicted Australian \u2013 and Labor \u2013 policy on the South China Sea, was incorrect, with audio of the press conference with Chinese media pointing to Dastyari having responded with prepared remarks. Dastyari later said he was \u201cshocked\u201d to hear the audio, as it did not match his \u201crecollection\u201d of the event. On Sunday Fairfax Media revealed that Dastyari had pressured the deputy Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, who was then the foreign affairs spokeswoman, not to meet a pro-democracy Chinese activist during a Hong Kong trip. Plibersek did not deny Dastyari had lobbied her to drop the meeting. Her office said only that she did not discuss conversations with colleagues but that the Hong Kong meeting still went ahead \u201cand that speaks for itself\u201d. On Monday two senior Labor frontbenchers broke ranks to question Dastyari\u2019s political future, with Linda Burney saying he should \u201cconsider his future\u201d, while Catherine King said he should \u201creflect\u201d on his future. The government seized on the Dastyari stories, with Malcolm Turnbull pushing for Shorten to act as a \u201ctest of leadership\u201d, and questioning the Labor senator\u2019s loyalty. \u201cWhose side is he on, not Australia\u2019s it would seem,\u201d Turnbull said late last month. On Monday the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, stepped up his attack from last week, calling Dastyari a \u201cdouble agent\u201d and calling for him to quit the Senate. In responding to the first stories, Dastyari said suggestions he was not loyal to Australia were \u201cincredibly hurtful\u201d. Considered a rising star when he blazed into the Senate in 2013, Dastyari\u2019s political prospects were considered irreparably damaged by the scandal. A powerbroker with the NSW right and a former Young Labor president, Dastyari was seen as a potential future cabinet star but was considered \u201creckless\u201d by some colleagues. \u201cHe has always let his mouth get ahead of his brain,\u201d one colleague said on Monday. \u201cHis mind just moves too fast for anything else to keep up.\u201d As the Senate rose for the year, the attorney general, George Brandis, confirmed he would be seeking to refer Dastyari to the parliament\u2019s privileges committee, which would have the power to examine Labor\u2019s links to Chinese donors. Dastyari\u2019s resignation heads off that committee inquiry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
