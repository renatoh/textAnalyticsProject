Grayson was yesterday announced as Leeds' new manager, despite having 18 months remaining on his contract at Bloomfield Road. Blackpool refused Leeds permission to speak to Grayson and rejected what they described as a \"derisory offer of compensation\", believed to be around \u00a3200,000, for his services. Yet Grayson handed in a letter of resignation yesterday morning and signed a contract with the fallen Yorkshire giants, provoking the immediate threat of legal action against the 39-year-old and his new employers. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston even considered applying for an injunction to prevent Grayson taking charge of Leeds for the first time on Boxing Day, when they host Coca-Cola League One leaders Leicester. Oyston has since shelved that plan but is determined to see Leeds punished for their pursuit and subsequent capture of the highly-rated Grayson, who led Blackpool out of League One and into the Coca-Cola Championship in May 2007. \"We have reported Leeds United to the Football League following an illegal approach for Simon Grayson and plan to take legal action against all parties,\" said Oyston. \"Why should we let Leeds think they get away with such a blatant disregard for the rules? \"If it was legally possibly we would have pushed hard for an injunction against Simon Grayson to stop him taking charge of Leeds. But it's not easy to get in front of a High Court judge at this time of year. \"I think Leeds knew that and that's a point that we will be making in our case against them.\" Oyston said Grayson had a clause in his contract which would allow him to leave for a rival club if a certain amount of compensation was paid to Blackpool. However, Oyston claimed: \"Leeds didn't even offer half of that figure so why should we accept the figure they offered? \"Simon should have left Blackpool with his head held high but it has happened this way because of the way Leeds have acted. I was very pleased to give Simon his chance and this wasn't the way I wanted it to end. Now he's gone to Leeds - and they're a trigger-happy bunch over there.\" Steve Thompson and Tony Parkes will take charge of Blackpool for the Boxing Day clash at Sheffield Wednesday, but Grayson could try and lure the pair to Leeds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
