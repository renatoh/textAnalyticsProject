The figures released to the Stock Exchange yesterday made grim reading, with turnover in the year ended May 31 2003 down from \u00a346.7m to \u00a345.4m and operating losses before player sales at \u00a313.5m, up from \u00a39.6m in 2002. The loss before tax last year was only \u00a3400,000 but 12 months later it had leapt to \u00a311.6m despite an increase in average attendances. Though the downturn in the transfer market was highlighted by the chairman Doug Ellis in his report to shareholders as one of the factors in the \"financial difficulties\" facing all clubs, Villa's underper formance on the field last season also hit them in the pocket. They reached the last eight of the Worthington Cup but overall it was a disappointing campaign, in which they finished 16th in the Premiership after flirting with relegation and failed to build a run in the FA Cup, leading to the resignation of Graham Taylor and a drop in Premier League prize money and related income of about \u00a31.3m. The man brought in during the summer to replace Taylor, though, maintains it is for that very reason the club must divert all funds possible to strengthening the team. O'Leary has already brought in the midfielder Gavin McCann for \u00a32.25m from relegated Sunderland and has agreed a similar fee for the same club's Denmark goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen after Paul Robinson turned down a move from Leeds. O'Leary, the former Leeds manager, still wants some new arrivals. \"If we can get mid-table this year, then that for me will be an improvement. That's what we've got to look at, then we can take it from there. \"That will depend on the signings we bring in and how quickly we can make that happen, but the aim is to improve and, if we can get to mid-table, great. But at the moment I've got no problems in picking a team at a time when I believe we need to improve.\" Last month Villa were approached by a representative of a potential major shareholder, believed to be a Venezuelan billionaire. However, Ellis maintained that the \"unsolicited approaches\" were purely \"speculative in nature\", and yesterday's statement reiterated: \"No further details have become available.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
