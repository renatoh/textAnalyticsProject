But I do need it because I am a queen and I deserve a rest. I\u2019m of the \u201cliving your best life\u201d mantra and I don\u2019t just talk it, I walk it. I\u2019ll have a long spa day \u2013 massage, mani, pedi, eyebrows \u2013 go for the sexiest dinner in this nice hotel on the bridge with all my girls, then get cocktails. I\u2019m single, but I\u2019m like Lady Gaga \u2013 she doesn\u2019t sleep with guys when she\u2019s writing her album because men steal her creative energy. But on my day off, I\u2019m allowed. London Hughes: To Catch a Dick is at Pleasance Courtyard every day until 25 August (apart from the 12th) \u2018Watching YouTube and making soup\u2019 \u2013 Alison Spittle I\u2019m doing an extra gig for Sarah Millican\u2019s podcast, Standard Issue Stands Up, on my day off. I\u2019m excited but it means this is the first year I won\u2019t have a full duvet day, watching programmes with no artistic merit. In Edinburgh, I\u2019ve found what helps my mental health is being able to cook for myself. I love making soup, so I\u2019ll make a big pot. There\u2019s this old recipe my mum used \u2013 grating a carrot, opening a tin of tomatoes and a stock cube, using whatever veg is decomposing at the bottom of the fridge, and throwing some salt and pepper on it. My version of mindfulness is watching YouTube and making soup. Alison Spittle: Mother of God is at Gilded Balloon Teviot until 26 August (not 13) \u2018We\u2019ll be hanging out at the kids\u2019 shows\u2019 \u2013 Ed Byrne Previously I\u2019ve taken the night off and gone into the Highlands. I love hill-walking and have committed to bagging all of Scotland\u2019s 282 Monros. I\u2019ve done 105 so far and always try and knock off a few more during the fringe. But my kids are going to be here this year, so I think it would be really bad form if I went: \u201cWell, I\u2019m pissing off to the Highlands!\u201d We\u2019ll be hanging out during the day seeing various kids\u2019 shows, then I\u2019ll be getting a babysitter and me and my wife will go out for a fancy-schmancy dinner. Ed Byrne: If I\u2019m Honest is at the Assembly Rooms until 25 August (not 12) \u2018I want to watch fireworks\u2019 \u2013 Yuriko Kotani I\u2019m going to enjoy the day off in an organic way. In Edinburgh there are so many people \u2013 maybe you bump into them and say: \u201cLet\u2019s have a coffee.\u201d But I don\u2019t know what kind of state I\u2019ll be in, so I\u2019ll listen to my body. I\u2019m doing my show in my second language and,a few years ago my brain was so exhausted that I couldn\u2019t speak in English properly! Two years ago, I did a show around 9:40pm and towards the end I started to hear fireworks. I was curious, so I might go watch the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. Yuriko Kotani: Somosomo is at the Pleasance Courtyard until 26 August (not 12) \u2018A serarate, solitary experience\u2019 \u2013 Jordan Brookes I look at the day off like a carrot dangling in front of me. Some people prefer not to break that momentum, but I need to. I\u2019ll listen to something repetitive and minimalist and look at nice things. In past years I\u2019ve gone round the art galleries. I would love to get out of the city but I might settle for sitting in the park and reading. As long as I can\u2019t see any posters. I\u2019ve always had Tuesday off as opposed to Monday, which most people choose. It means it feels like a separate, solitary experience. I feel justified in putting on some Philip Glass and going for a wander. Jordan Brookes: I\u2019ve Got Nothing is at Pleasance Courtyard until 25 August (not 13) \u2018It\u2019s your only chance to have a hangover\u2019 \u2013 Heidi Regan The main reason for the day off \u2013 or what would\u2019ve been my reason \u2013 is to have a big night the night before. You can have a hangover and it won\u2019t affect the show. I technically have the last day of the festival off, but I\u2019m using it to go home earlier. A lot of people feel pressure on their day off to see the shows they clash with. You make promises to friends, but it\u2019s horrific because you\u2019re probably choosing between five shows. This year, I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh no, unfortunately I\u2019ll never be able to see you!\u2019 Heidi Regan: Heidi Kills Time is at Pleasance Courtyard until 25 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
