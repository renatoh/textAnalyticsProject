And while the majority of Britain's snappers spent most of today running up and down the banks of the Thames taking pictures of a geographically-challenged whale that resembles John Hartson, thankfully there were still enough around to capture images of a beaming Arsene Wenger handing over a Ribena-coloured shirt to a beaming Theo Walcott, who will sign his first professional contract, for the Gunners, when he turns 17 on March 16. \"I am so pleased to be joining Arsenal, a club I have admired for a long time,\" gushed Walcott with the kind of pride most 16-year-olds keep a lid on until they lose their cherry or get their first Asbo. \"Coming to Arsenal will give me the opportunity to work with world-class players every day and play football at the highest possible level,\" he continued, as wad-waving Chelsea suits looked down from a level Arsenal can only dream of reaching and shook their heads in disbelief. And with playtime looming and a distressed whale to be tagged with spray cans, it was time for Walcott's new babysitter to make some earth-shattering revelations about his charge. \"Theo Walcott is a very young player,\" said Wenger of the versatile youth international with five career goals to his name. \"He is a talented player with huge potential. We are delighted he has signed for the club and he will make a fantastic addition to our squad.\" And with the relevant clich\u00e9s duly delivered, all present rushed down to the riverbank to see if London's new aquatic pet could spout anything more interesting through his blow-hole before the papers went to press. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"The matter's over for me. I've spoken to Sven. I had a good chat with Sven and what he told me, I accept. I've good friends at the FA as well. If I get tickets - and I want to go to the World Cup final - I hope England are one of the teams in it\" - are we the only ones who think Dvd O'Lry fancies a trip to Germany on the FA after he 'made his peace' with the England coach? ********************* PUTTING IT UP THE BRIBER Last week, in surely the most outlandish rant by any footballer since former Coventry goalkeeper David Icke claimed the world was run by reptilian humanoids with a penchant for blood sacrifices and intergalactic mind-war, Luton boss Mike Newell declared that many agents offered bungs and some managers accepted them. He had no receipts and no signed confessions. Hell, he hadn't even gone to the trouble of putting a tea towel on his head and setting up a sting on a yacht parked off Dubai. Clearly, the man was not to be taken seriously, even if the FA did humour him with a hearing. So why in odd's name has level-headed, no-nonsense guff-crusher Ian Holloway today decided to support Newell's notions? \"There are agents out there with whacking great wheelbarrows who say, 'fill that up with money',\" revealed the QPR crusader to a stunned press corps. And while he refused to disclose the source of these amazing talking wheelbarrows, Deep Throat Holloway did cite one case where he himself was offered a bribe. \"I thought I was getting a certain player on a free transfer,\" he snitched. \"His agent then came back to me and said 'My fee is this amount and you will get that from it'. I went back to the board and said 'You must be joking'. I earn my money through my contract, no other way.\" Lonely Newell was quick to hail his new partner in crime-fighting. \"It's nice that someone has eventually come out and supported me, because it has taken a while,\" he hurrahed, after emerging from a phone box with his Y-fronts over his trousers. Reacting to the sensation, a flustered FA reluctantly interrupted brunch to bang out a predictable reply: \"We will be contacting Ian Holloway to request a meeting,\" read a statement on gravy-stained paper. \"We take these matters very seriously and our compliance department will thoroughly investigate any evidence of wrongdoing. We would expect anyone who has evidence of any wrong doing to come forward.\" What, even the culprits? Surely that's a bit na\u00efve? ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Man City madman Stuart Pearce is willing to give Andy Cole a coaching role so that he can teach club youngsters how to look sullen and changing their names in a bid to be taken more seriously. Not only are Spurs doing away with their Latin logo, but they'll also kick Grzegorz Rasiak's lumbering carcass out of White Hart Lane; Wolves are set to pay GBP2m for the hapless Pole. Stoke will use the cash raised by the sale of John Halls to Reading to buy a mystery right-back who plays for 'a small club in Holland'. Provided Ajax and Feyenoord don't beat them to it, that is. And Ian Harte will remain lost in Levante a little longer after the Spanish second-division side told 'Arry Redknapp he couldn't sign the Irishman till the summer. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF John Arne Riise has signed a new contract to keep him at Anfield until 2009, by which time he'll have bagged a knighthood and be known as Sir John A Riise. Former BBC bigwig Greg Dyke is the new chairman of Brentford after a fans' takeover of the club. \"The days when clubs like Brentford could expect someone from outside to pour money into the club are over. The fans are now in charge,\" he said, dampening the celebratory mood somewhat. Alan Stubbs has left Sunderland and gone back to add his considerable weight to the Everton backline. Middlebore's Mark Schwarzer, meanwhile, has decided to stay at the Riverside. A decision which has absolutely nothing to do with the complete lack of interest in his services. The Queen's Celtic have signed a pre-contract agreement with Hibs captain Gary Caldwell. * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS \"Re: the alleged rodent infestation at the GlazerBowl. Don't rats normally desert sinking ships?\" - Alan Gillespie (and others). \"Re: yesterday's Kenny Miller story. My mate is using your description of the Wolves kit as being 'orange' as the basis to end our long argument over whether or not my beloved team plays in their true 'old gold' colours. For the love of a little tradition, please publish this letter as a rebuff to such ludicrous comments\" - Danny Carney. \"Orange? Old gold, more like. Unless Wolves have been Tangoed without my knowledge\" - Roz Beany. \"Re: the uproar about Tom Kelsall copying (or not) from Football 365 to win Tuesday's Fiver letters. Surely Phil McTim's blatant plagiarising of Little Britain to win yesterday's letter of the day was a far greater crime, seeing as Vicky Pollard is not funny\" - Daniel Kennedy. \"Re: Chris Kamara's eggs and bacon quote (yesterday's Fiver letters). Shortly before that he had said David Healy 'eats those sorts of chances for breakfast'. Chris clearly isn't a Weetabix man\" - Mark Andrews. \"Re: the Fiver's golden rule: 'if you're going to go paddling wear your wellies' (yesterday's TV and radio). I first heard this line in an episode of Bread in about 1986. But do you give Carla Lane credit? Do you hell. Another example of the London-based media conspiracy against Liverpool\" - Richard Byres. \"If Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink signs for Fulham (yesterday's Fiver), he'll join a dressing room roster resembling a cross between a Bond villain convention and a 70s p*rn stars' reunion: Carlos Bocanegra, Steed Malbranque, Zat Knight, Heidar Helguson, Papa Bouba Diop, Zesh Rehman, Luis Boa Morte and Moritz Volz. The agents of Nyron Nosworthy, Ulises De la Cruz and Lomana LuaLua are surely monitoring the situation. And before anyone writes in, I know I'm in no position to mock\" - Ronan Gingles. \"The closure of the followfollow.com (yesterday's Fiver) boards has nothing to do with Kenny Miller's transfer from the Pope's O'Rangers. They have moved to a new website, on which there are many comments wishing the Queen's Celtic all the best with our reject striker\" - Jamie McPherson. \"On Wednesday you reported that Paraguay striker Julio Gonzalez had his arm amputated, then yesterday you told us Hibs forward Dean Shiels is having an eye surgically removed.

Several clogged-up email inboxes later, we're still sifting through the detritus. Channel 4: My Name Is Earl (10pm) \"This weekend I will mostly be going to see up-and-coming popular beat combo Soldive at The Garage, Highbury Corner on Saturday night,\" amps-on-11-ahoys Matt Kearsey. \"You may be interested to know that their singer Steve found drummer James through the Fiver last year, when Helen Tomkins, then 32, was making her first stab at finding a man in your TV and radio section.\" Five: EhJohnEhBarnes'sEhFootballEhNightEhAndmyguesttonightis... (12.05am) And they haven't split due to artistic differences yet? Fantastic. If Helen hits it off with Chris Bond on Sunday afternoon, that's their wedding band sorted. Boxing Classics: Nigel Benn v Chris Eubank (1am) \"This weekend I will mostly be lying to my coach about my ankle injury and claiming I can 'run it off',\" writes a duplicitous Matthew Howe, while Clare Brint will be \"looking at n*ked pictures of myself and 1,699 others, all in the name of art, at the Baltic in Gateshead (see yesterday's theguardian). My mum and dad will be so proud that I'm a n*de centrefold.\" Football Argentina - Independiente v San Lorenzo (4.20am) And for those of you who are jealous that you won't be having as much fun as this cross-section of the Fiver-reading community, Ben Shipman is here to reveal it's not all fun, games, posing in the buff and bad music: \"This Saturday I'll be attending an all-day NCT child-rearing class {Child-rearing class? How hard can it be? - Fiver Ed] where all the blokes seem to be having a competition to see who can crack the most unfunny and unoriginal gags,\" he moans ... Sky Sports 1: Fifa Futbol Mundial (5.30pm) ... despite being set for a belter of a weekend compared to the sorry sap that is Daniel Miles. \"I agreed to a weekend in the country with my girlfriend when I was drunk a few weeks ago,\" he whines, clearly unwilling to do the time, despite having committed the crime. \"We're staying at her best mate's mum's house, which means a weekend with three women, a giant horse-dog named Leo and no football for me.\" Soccer AM's All Sports Show (6pm) Grim, but comparative luxury compared to what named-after-a-Scottish-law-firm Fiver reader Fraser Bailey has planned. \"This weekend I will mostly be watching Hibernian FC take on Dunfermline at Easter Road,\" he och-aye the noos. \"I realise this might seem mundane compared to participating in a booze-fuelled romp with somebody who is desperate enough to ask the Fiver to sort her out, but there you are.\" Premier League Preview (7pm) \"This weekend I'm meeting my wedding photographer, meeting my wedding DJ and meeting my wedding cake maker,\" groans Andy Seaman with all the enthusiasm of a prisoner on Death Row. Albeit a prisoner on Death Row that's planning a lavish wedding before he fries in the chair. Live Football League: Crystal Palace v Reading (7.30pm) \"Thanks to my girlfriend receiving a massive pay rise yesterday, I will be enjoying a fine meal in a fancy restaurant before retiring to the couch to enjoy a DVD and conjugal relations with her,\" writes Thomas Thompson, with more than a hint of smugness ... Bravo: Gazzetta Football Italia (12.45am) ... that suggests he's completely oblivious to the fact that now his missus earns way more money than he does, it's only a matter of time before she dumps him for somebody better. Radio Five Live (Sport On Five (7pm) \"My girlfriend's away in Miami this weekend so it's wall-to-wall football for me,\" writes Gavin Hutchinson. Talksport: Kick-Off (7pm) For you, yes. But we've been to Miami and would be far more interested to hear what your girlfriend's going to be up to behind your back. Newstalk 106FM (www.newstalk106ie): Off The Ball With Ger Gilroy (7pm) Much the same thing as Helen Tomkins and Chris Bond, we reckon. Except without the sporting preliminaries. Now we're going to give yesterday's riff a novel twist. We want to hear your plans for next weekend.
