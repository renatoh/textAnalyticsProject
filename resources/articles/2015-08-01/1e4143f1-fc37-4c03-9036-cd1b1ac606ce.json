The blood-doping data, detailing 12,000 tests from 5,000 athletes, was leaked to the Sunday Times and German broadcaster ARD/WRD by a whistleblower at the International Association of Athletics Federations The newspaper claims the leak reveals \u201cthe extraordinary extent of cheating by athletes at the world\u2019s most prestigious events\u201d, yet alleges none of the athletes involved was stripped of their medals. Robin Parisotto, described as one of the \u201cworld\u2019s foremost anti-doping experts\u201d, reviewed the data. \u201cNever have I seen such an alarmingly abnormal set of blood values,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many athletes appear to have doped with impunity, and it is damning that the IAAF appears to have idly sat by and let this happen.\u201d Ten medals at London 2012 were won by athletes who have recorded dubious results, but Mo Farah, who won 10,000m and 5,000m gold, is not among them, although there is one leading British athlete with suspicious readings. While the evidence is not concrete proof of doping, the revelations raise more significant concerns over whether the sport\u2019s governing body is doing enough to deal with the problem ahead of the World Athletics Championships in Beijing this month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
