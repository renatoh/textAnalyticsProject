Carter, who suffers from Crohn\u2019s disease, last year recovered from testicular cancer to resume his career. The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association chairman Jason Ferguson said: \u201cAli is the toughest competitor I know and, having spoken to him over the last few days, I can assure everyone he has the fight to get through the battle ahead.\u201d Jimmy White, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1995, wrote on Twitter: \u201cAbsolutely gutted for Ali, praying for you mate.\u201d Carter had been due to play yesterday in Gloucester, in qualifying stages for the Wuxi Classic. He played almost a full season after being diagnosed with testicular cancer last summer, ending at the World Championship in Sheffield. A professional since 1996, Carter is ranked 13th in the world and has been as high as No2. PA David Weir sets world wheelchair mile record David Weir has set a world record for the wheelchair mile, but failed in his attempt to be the first man to go under the three-minute mark. The 34-year-old was taking part in the Bupa Westminster Mile in London, marking the 60th anniversary of Sir Roger Bannister\u2019s sub-four-minute time over the distance. \u201cI gave it my best shot,\u201d said Weir after completing the course in 3min 7sec. Bannister greeted Weir after he was first to cross the finish line and the 85-year-old was optimistic that the six-time Paralympic champion could break the three-minute barrier next year. He said: \u201cI hope so. He tells me he has managed to break three minutes in Richmond Park but I think that was a downhill course. He still has a little bit more to try out before he does it but I think he might manage it next year.\u201d In the British One Mile Road Championships, Chris O\u2019Hare won the men\u2019s race in a time of 4min 5.03sec while Alison Leonard took the women\u2019s title in 4:32.90.
