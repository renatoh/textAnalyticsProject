We were looking forward to a slugfest between Blu-ray and HD-DVD, the two blue-ray laser formats bidding to become the high-definition replacement for DVD, but both seem more intent on committing seppuku (aka \"hari-kari\") instead. The first Blu-ray player went on sale in the US this week - the $1,000 (\u00a3550) Samsung BD-P1000. The Digital Bits tried it with four movies and opined: \"The Blu-ray camp has dropped a dud with their big launch too. Every bit as klutzy as HD-DVD.\" (http://tinyurl.com/zxmlk) Stuttering replay, scaling issues, poor definition and bugs meant Blu-ray probably underperformed HD-DVD, leaving the website's reviewer \"less than impressed\". Sony couldn't even make the launch of its own format. Just a few weeks ago, its BDP-S1 Blu-ray player was due in July, but this slipped to August and then to \"on or about October 25, 2006\". Sony also missed the boat with delays to its Blu-ray based PlayStation 3 console, and presumably felt it had to respond to the HD-DVD camp's pre-emptive strike. But you have to wonder how much serious bug-testing and product refinement might get lost in a rush to market. Still, lest it be seen to be taking an unfair advantage of Sony's stumbles, Toshiba tried to redress the balance. According to Reuters, Toshiba's president Atsutoshi Nishida told the company's annual shareholders' meeting in Tokyo: \"We have not given up on a unified format. We would like to seek ways for unifying the standards if opportunities arise.\" With players from both high-definition formats reaching US shops and movie studios starting to churn out high-def versions of old hits, it's a bit late to launch into that old vaudeville routine - \"let's call the whole thing off\". But that might be the sensible thing to do. US market research firm iSuppli Corp has stripped down Toshiba's $500 player and reckons it could be losing $200 on each one sold. Sony could lose as much or more on each Blu-ray player and PS3. But most of us are going to wait a few years until the systems are debugged and prices come down before investing our cash. Why not spend the time doing the job properly, instead of rushing out products to sell at a loss? At best, format wars have only one winner. But sometimes they have two losers. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
