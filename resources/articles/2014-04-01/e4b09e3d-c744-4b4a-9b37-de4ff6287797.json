Avalanche proves a middling followup to that first collection of airy, experimental R&amp;B. Coco's vocals \u2013 feted by everyone from Jay Z and Tyler the Creator to Kendrick Lamar (who slips in to guest on the intimate, retro-styled Better Off) \u2013 are a joy, blooming with an impressive range across sophisticated, mid-tempo instrumentals that, frustratingly, tend to waft rather than fizz. Avalanche is not without its sweet spots, though; these tend to happen when Quadron turn up the rhythm and let loose, opting for funky, throb'n'glide disco bass on Favourite Star and lively hand-clapped percussion on the big, humming piano-pop of standout single, Hey Love."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
