Andrews has the observant eye of the bartender she once was, pinpointing the little horrors that make romantic disasters stick in the mind: on How Quickly Your Heart Mends she\u2019s crying in a bar toilet while \u201cthe jukebox is playing a sad song for all the ugly Americans\u201d; on Only in My Mind she acknowledges that her daydream of domesticity in a house in \u201ca small forest grove\u201d is a chimera. So the album goes: over and above the intimacy of the sparse acoustic landscapes and her unaffected vocals \u2013 Joni Mitchell and Alela Diane are clear influences \u2013 the delicate lyrical barbs make Honest Life one to hear. It could have done with an upbeat song or two to puncture the introspection, but that\u2019s just being picky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
