Only a single floor of each inverted 35-storey skyscraper is visible at ground level. Giant mirrors mounted directly above the central wells reflect sunlight to the apartments below. Prismatic glass ensures even light throughout the day, while fresh, conditioned air is pumped down from the surface. \u201cThe whole structure, in case of an earthquake, will vibrate together, resisting any crushing strain,\u201d declared a 1931 edition of Everyday Science and Mechanics that called the design the product of \u201cthe best engineering brains of Japan\u201d. The idea was to future-proof Tokyo against the threat of another tremor to rival the 1923 quake, which had devastated and traumatised the city less than a decade earlier. Like many fantastical projects featured in the popular technology magazines of the 1930s, 40s and 50s, the depthscraper was never likely to become reality. It remains part of unbuilt Tokyo, an alternate city of unrealised plans: some conceptual, some speculative and some derailed by economic or political shocks. Depthscrapers featured in the November 1931 edition of US magazine Everyday Science and Mechanics One of the most potentially transformative and best known of these was the Plan for Tokyo 1960 by Kenzo Tange, Japan\u2019s most influential architect and a future winner of the Pritzker prize. Tange \u2013 who had been in charge of the reconstruction of Hiroshima after the second world war and designed its Peace Centre and Memorial Park \u2013 proposed an extensive expansion of bomb-damaged Tokyo into the shallow waters of its bay. His manmade islands, bridges and floating platforms offered the capital an adaptable space for future growth and change \u2013 and an alternative to uncontrolled expansion of the city proper. Paul Dobraszczyk, a teaching fellow at the Bartlett School of Architecture and the author of Future Cities, says a number of floating cities were proposed in the aftermath of the second world war, inspired by sea forts and large pontoons developed by the military. He sees the Tokyo Bay plan of Tange, and another by the French architect Paul Maymont, as being \u201cdriven by a modernist faith in the power of technology and the mass production of building components\u201d in an effort to create \u201can entirely new type of urban environment \u2026 free from the traditional restraints of land-based cities\u201d. By the 1970s this technological optimism had waned, says Dobraszczyk. Future proposals for floating cities would emphasise organic forms and were often entirely separated from terrestrial cities.

The conceptual project was announced in 2004 by the Shimizu Corporation \u2013 the engineering giant behind the Aqua Line tunnel-bridge across the bay and the Cocoon Tower in Shinjuku \u2013 and featured on the Discovery Channel\u2019s Extreme Engineering series. The whole city would be built by automated robots. Its carbon nanotube struts would allow it to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis, and power would be generated from a photovoltaic coating and algae. Although the project is (very) theoretically due for completion by 2110, Shimizu is also busy with the Ocean Spiral city under the sea, a space hotel and a 250-mile belt of solar panels around the moon, so that date may be subject to change.

Designed in 1989 by the venerable British architect Norman Foster, the 840-metre steel tower was to have been divided by \u201ctown squares\u201d every 30 floors and would have featured high-speed lifts the size of buses. Helical bands around the tower were to give structural support, and water tanks at the top could be rotated as a counterweight against strong winds. It was commissioned by the Obayashi Corporation, the construction firm behind the Tokyo Skytree and the Roppongi Hills development. The company was also responsible for the Tokyo Laputa Plan for a series of 1 sq km \u201cplatform cities\u201d built six to eight storeys above ground level to relieve overcrowding and provide much-needed open space.

The tower would be almost double the size of the world\u2019s current tallest building, Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, and significantly higher than the 1km-tall under-construction Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia. The skyscraper would contain housing for around 55,000 people, linked by multi-level \u201csky lobbies\u201d, and feature shops, restaurants, hotels, gyms, libraries and health clinics. The design includes plans to harvest water from clouds, while farms floating in the surrounding waters help provide food for the 500,000 residents of the wider development. The Sky Mile Tower was announced in 2016 with no funding. The Sky Mile Tower was the centrepiece of Kohn Pedersen Fox\u2019s Next Tokyo 2045 project.

The late British-Iraqi architect won the original design competition in 2012, but three years later, when costs ballooned to almost twice the original estimate, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, scrapped the plan. Unimpressed Tokyoites had already likened it to a potty and a bike helmet. Construction on a new stadium, by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, began in 2016 and is due for completion later this year.
