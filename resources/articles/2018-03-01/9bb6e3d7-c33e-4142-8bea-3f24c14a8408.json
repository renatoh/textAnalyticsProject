Johnson Joy departed from his position as chief information officer at Carson\u2019s Department for Housing and Urban Development (Hud) on Tuesday. A Hud spokesman said Carson accepted Joy\u2019s resignation. Two sources familiar with the situation said Joy was escorted from the department headquarters by security. Joy had been running an opaque religious charity with Naved Jafry, a senior adviser to Joy at Hud, who previously resigned after the Guardian found he had exaggerated his biography and been repeatedly sued for alleged fraud. Joy\u2019s departure on Tuesday came as the Guardian was preparing a new article on a complaint filed by Joy\u2019s former executive assistant, which alleged that she was fired from her job because she raised concerns about possible corruption in Joy\u2019s office. Katrina Hubbard said she was reassigned from her position and then terminated altogether in January soon after she raised the alarm within Hud about an apparent misuse of public funds. \u201cI reported information about fraud, waste and abuse, and as a result I was retaliated against,\u201d Hubbard told the Guardian. Hubbard\u2019s case is being investigated by the office of special counsel (OSC), which oversees federal workers\u2019 employment rights. Last month the Guardian revealed that the OSC was investigating a complaint from Helen Foster, a senior Hud official, who said she was demoted for refusing to break a legal spending cap on improvements to Carson\u2019s office. A spokesperson for OSC declined to comment. The complaint follows reports that Donald Trump is considering removing Carson after a series of embarrassments, including his office ordering a $31,000 dining set. Hubbard said in her complaint, which was seen by the Guardian, that she became a civil servant at Hud in September last year and worked as executive assistant to Johnson Joy, Hud\u2019s chief information officer. She had previously done the job as a contract worker for Joy and his predecessor. She said she discovered that Accel Corporation, a contractor that supplies Joy\u2019s office with staff, was being systematically overpaid. Some Accel subcontractors were falsely classed in higher pay grades, she said, while some billed for days and hours they had not worked. Jafry, the adviser who resigned, was an Accel subcontractor. Hubbard said she told Hud\u2019s inspector general of her findings on 8 January this year. Stacye Loman, the owner of Accel Corporation, did not respond to requests for comment. Over the following two days, Joy and deputy chief information officer Kevin Cooke held a pair of meetings that appeared on their schedules as \u201cclassified issue\u201d, according to screenshots taken by Hubbard. On the third day, Hubbard said, she received a memo telling her that she was being reassigned from her job. Less than a month later, she was fired. A termination letter given to Hubbard said she was being fired because of her performance. \u201cI was never informed of any problems with my performance,\u201d she told OSC, and had received a raise in her contract pay last year in recognition of her good work. While testifying to a House subcommittee on Tuesday, Carson appeared to blame his wife, Candy, for ordering the $31,000 dining set, which he has since said he is trying to cancel. Carson said that after browsing some possible options, he became busy with other duties. \u201cI left it with my wife,\u201d he said. In an August 2017 email released last month, a Hud official wrote that \u201cthe secretary and Mrs Carson picked out\u201d the furniture. In the latest of several explanations given for the expenditure, Carson said on Tuesday that his existing furniture had become unsafe. \u201cPeople had been stuck by nails, a chair had collapsed with somebody sitting in it,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
