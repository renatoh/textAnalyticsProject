The England captain's late goal was almost as uplifting as his famous free-kick against Greece, and if he has just avoided the onerous trip to Azerbaijan by picking up a booking, he can be forgiven after single-handedly rescuing the afternoon from workaday mediocrity. Considering Wales has just been omitted from the European Union's latest political map, this must have been the most over-hyped fixture since, well, since the last time England met any of their neighbours in a competitive game. That would have been the ludicrously pumped-up Battle of Britain of five years ago, when, in a demonstration of how far British football had fallen from the standards being set by the rest of Europe, Kevin Keegan's ageing and uninspired side limped past an abysmal Scotland to claim the right to be humiliated at Euro 2000. How times have changed. Scotland are now even more abysmal, and England are incomparably better, as Wales have just discovered, with two or three good young players for every position (except left wing, obviously) and a coach who is not afraid to let them show what they can do. Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson was variously described as bold, attacking and adventurous when the team sheets arrived to confirm England would play with three forwards, yet all he was actually doing was making sure he posed as many problems as possible for the reserves and lower league players in the Wales defence. Playing Wayne Rooney in the hole was also a recognition that the Manchester United player naturally operates deeper than conventional strikers, saved Eriksson from having to add to Michael Owen's frustration and allowed him to gloss over the left-wing problem. For all the neatness and enterprise of Eriksson's solution, there was a suspicion he might not have risked it against opponents any stronger than Wales, and might not have considered it at all had Wayne Bridge been fit. Wales did their best to counter Eriksson's cunning with a late reshuffle of their own when Andy Melville was injured in the warm-up, but pushing Mark Delaney into central defence and using Simon Davies as an emergency right-back only left the visitors looking even more patched up. Delaney was still congratulating himself on checking Owen's first run when the striker deflected Frank Lampard's shot past Paul Jones for an opening goal in under four minutes. 'Are you Scotland in disguise?' the wags in the crowd demanded to know, showing a tad more wit than when spoiling the silence for Ken Bigley with anti-Welsh jibes a few minutes earlier. That was about as witty as it got. 'Stand up if you hate the Welsh' and 'No surrender to the IRA' do not count as higher forms of terrace originality, though the crowd needed to do something to stay awake. The combined effect of the early goal and the Welsh defensive switch was to take all the urgency out of the contest. Whereas everyone had been expecting a full-blooded, Premiership-style scrap, Wales were in damage limitation mode from the fourth minute onwards, sacrificing most of their attacking ambitions and concentrating on not getting too stretched at the back. The result was that England ended up with too much time. Too much time on the ball, too much time to think. Instead of darting into space and making the most of momentary openings, players such as Owen, Rooney and Jermain Defoe found themselves surrounded by their own colleagues. There was always an easy option to move the ball along sideways and England usually took it. It was not the ideal situation in which to judge the effectiveness of Eriksson's bold new formation. Even the supposed weaknesses on the wings were never put to the test after the Welsh reorganisation. Owen looked the liveliest of the three forwards, with Defoe not quite sharp enough to accept a couple of early chances and Rooney playing deeper than usual and gradually coming to the realisation that not even he can score with every touch. Swagger is all very well in an 18-year-old, but Rooney must play the team game too. There were times when Rooney went for glory when shooting was simply the wrong option, and there were signs too that the rest of the England team are starting to believe the teenager's publicity. David Beckham was guilty on a couple of occasions of ignoring better options in favour of unimaginatively giving the ball to Rooney. With Owen and Defoe hardly setting new standards for unselfish interpassing, England's attack had begun to look dysfunctional before Alan Smith replaced the latter. Although there were a couple of pleasing link-ups in the first half, England spent most of the game looking for someone to raise the tempo or make the afternoon memorable with a moment of undoubted class. Significantly, that person was not one of the three strikers but the much-maligned captain. Shaun Wright-Phillips would not have scored the goal Beckham supplied to secure victory. Yet by the same token, had Wales's best chance of the game fallen to a deadlier finisher than Craig Bellamy (that means anyone else on the pitch) the scores might have been levelled 10 minutes earlier. Had Mark Hughes been on the pitch, even in his suit, he would have buried the volley Bellamy fluffed and England would have been looking at another Austria scenario. That's Wales's problem. Their great players are never around at the same time. England might be thought to have the opposite problem, though on this evidence they still have more promising players than great ones.
