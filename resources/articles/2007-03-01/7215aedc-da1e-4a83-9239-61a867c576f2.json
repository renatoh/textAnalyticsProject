She has natural star quality, as this concert amply demonstrated. Balsom is also proving resourceful in creating a repertoire on which to base a high-profile career, with arrangements and appropriations from across the centuries. Such a range requires a variety of trumpets, with even the cornett - its mouthpiece similar to that of the trumpet - included in a sequence of renaissance pieces by William Byrd. It was a slightly curious choice but one that underlined Balsom's pragmatic approach. That approach was most boldly asserted in her own arrangement of the Sarabande and Gigue from Bach's Solo Cello Suite No 2, whose graceful articulation and fluency defied any purist objections. In fact, it is Balsom's infinite variety of expressive colour and tone that lifts her playing out of the ordinary. This was revealed particularly in her instinct for matching the phrasing of violinist Richard Milone and cellist Julia Graham in Bach's Concerto in D and in the Handel Suite in D heard before the interval. Balsom's affinity for the baroque is only half the story, though, and it was the 20th-century music that caught the imagination. Manuel de Falla's Seven Songs were delivered with an interpretive flair that evoked all the fiery atmosphere of the original words, with pianist Tom Poster coming into his own. But, for mood, nothing could beat the three Tangos by Astor Piazzolla, smouldering such Latin passion that St George's briefly became a smoky Argentinian nightclub."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
