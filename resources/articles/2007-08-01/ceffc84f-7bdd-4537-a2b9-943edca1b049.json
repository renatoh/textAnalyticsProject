The buying spree, which RBS is due to reveal to investors before the markets open today, began last Friday and was completed yesterday morning to take advantage of a temporary collapse in the Dutch bank's share price. RBS spent \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.35bn) hoovering up shares in ABN at \u20ac34 a share. The deal is likely to cement the lead already built up by RBS and its consortium partners, Belgian bank Fortis and Santander of Spain, in the race for ABN. The banks are in a pitched battle with Barclays, which announced its intention to buy ABN in an agreed merger earlier this year. RBS wrecked the fairytale ending Barclays planned for its record-breaking bank merger proposal with a higher offer in cash, compared with Barclays' mainly share-based offer. The share buying spree overshadowed an announcement by Barclays yesterday that its bid had received regulatory approval from the Dutch finance ministry and main financial regulator in the form of a \"declaration of no objection\" (DNO). Barclays said the approval showed investors how its proposal was more advanced than the RBS bid, which is not expected to gain all the regulatory approval it needs until at least the middle of next month. John Varley, Barclays' chief executive, said: \"The granting of the DNO is an important milestone in our proposed merger with ABN Amro.\" The Dutch finance ministry has to give a DNO to approve the takeover of ABN Amro by either Barclays or the Royal Bank of Scotland-led consortium. Barclays agreed to move its headquarters to Amsterdam and cut thousands of UK jobs as part of its merger proposal, angering unions and some investors who have argued that the bank should remain independent. Despite the lower value of its proposal, Barclays maintains that its offer will provide \"superior long-term value\" for shareholders. It would become the world's fifth largest bank if the deal goes ahead. Last month it startled investors with an audacious plan to link up with the China Development Bank and the Singaporean government's investment arm, Temasek, to increase the cash element in its bid. Barclays was able to table an improved \u20ac67.5bn (\u00a345.3bn) cash-and-shares offer for the Dutch bank after CDC agreed to inject \u00a37bn into the merger, should it go ahead, and around \u00a32bn if it failed. The RBS-led consortium plans to break up the Dutch bank and parcel up its operations between them. RBS, which has tabled a \u00a348bn approach for ABN, wants to take the wholesale banking operations and elements of its empire in the far east and China, leaving the retail operations in Europe, Brazil and other outposts to its consortium partners. So far it has won the backing of most analysts who predict that while the RBS offer is more complicated and will take longer to gain regulatory clearance, it offers more cash to investors. Yesterday, analysts at the broking firm Panmure Gordon said the firm favoured the RBS bid because the recent crisis in the credit markets would be likely to hit Barclays Capital. They argued that Barclays had significantly increased its lending to hedge funds and private equity firms that have come under pressure from rising interests rates and a squeeze on lending by major banks. \"Given BarCap's acknowledged expertise in fixed-income and the prevalence of highly-levered long strategies among the debt hedge funds, there is a material risk that some of BarCap's counterparties may be in trouble.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
