Under proposals due to be outlined at the party\u2019s autumn conference, Labour will say it wants to plant the trees at hospitals to battle pollution and counteract the NHS\u2019s carbon footprint. The plan would also provide therapeutic spaces for patients and staff, which Labour believes would help recovery and promote wellbeing. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, will say the plans are part of a vision to make the NHS the greenest health service in the world, at a time when it is a significant contributor to carbon emissions in the UK. He will declare a climate emergency in the NHS and unveil new commitments to help the health service meet a net zero carbon emissions target, including the installation of 150,000 solar panels and replacing polluting ambulances with low-emission vehicles. Ashworth also wants clean air zones around NHS buildings and more energy efficient systems across the estate. \u201cActually, the NHS is one of the biggest polluters in the country, representing 6.3% of the carbon footprint in England. It\u2019s more than the annual emissions from passenger aircraft departing from Heathrow. But I want to move to a net zero greenest health service in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to resolve air quality just by planting a million trees but it is an important gesture and also, particularly in mental health trusts, access to green space has a huge therapeutic value.\u201d He will tell the party\u2019s conference in Brighton next week: \u201cAir pollution kills up to 40,000 people in England every year costing society more than \u00a320bn. We have one of the highest rates of asthma deaths for young people in Europe. \u201cAs health secretary, I\u2019ll declare a climate emergency across our NHS. It\u2019s my commitment that a Labour government will deliver the greenest health service in the world. Our ambition is a net zero NHS.\u201d He said hospitals would get green makeovers as ageing buildings were upgraded and repaired, prioritising solar panels and energy efficiency. \u201cWhen the NHS procures it will do so ethically and sustainably. And we\u2019ll guarantee a right to green space for patients and staff with an NHS forest planting 1 million trees across our NHS \u2013 a carbon-storing tree for every member of staff,\u201d he will say. The policy will be unveiled as activists in Momentum, the grassroots group of Jeremy Corbyn supporters, announce plans at the party conference for Labour to adopt a Green New Deal agenda. Momentum has announced it is backing a target of zero carbon by 2030, which has been passed by about 90 constituency Labour parties and has backing from the Communication Workers Union. If passed, the target will be Labour\u2019s most progressive green policy, with other political parties in the UK committing to net zero by 2050. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is preparing to speak at the youth climate strike in London on Friday. He is expected to thank participants for \u201ceducating us about the climate crisis and the emergency of species extinction and biodiversity loss\u201d. \u201cI know the situation can look bleak,\u201d he will say. \u201cWe have a prime minister that has called global warming a \u2018primitive fear without foundation\u2019. The US president is a full-blown climate denier, putting our planet in danger by pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. And the Amazon is on fire, looted by big corporations with a Brazilian president watching on who doesn\u2019t care. \u201cBut when we see young people demanding urgent action, it\u2019s an inspiration. When I see this movement growing \u2013 and it\u2019s growing every day \u2013 I know we can tackle the climate emergency. \u201cThe next Labour government will welcome your pressure and hear your demands for change. We will kick start a green industrial revolution and protect our planet, so it\u2019s there to give life and joy to generations to come.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
