Back in October the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, had asked seven specific questions of the Premier League, Football League and the Football Association, but he did so within a passionate conference speech to Supporters Direct, in which he argued that football clubs truly belong to their fans (not, the implication clearly was, to investors). He said the game as it is now, is so thoroughly commercialised, risks \"losing further touch with its traditional supporter base\" and called on football to \"reassess its relationship with money\". The Premier League, in reply, went nowhere near that far. Instead, it buried its head in the detail. You do not need to make an accountant joke to note that few in football's traditional supporter base will be leaping out of their seats at the news that the auditing of clubs is about to be improved. Give the Premier League its due, though; at least independent accountants are to look at whether clubs are carrying too much debt and certify that they are able to complete their fixtures, in line with Uefa's licensing system. The \"fit and proper person test\" is to be improved a little: people will have to prove they are not convicted crooks before they take over a club and not, as things currently \u2013 remarkably \u2013 stand, once they are already in charge. Yet Burnham asked for more. He wanted the league to consider \"the amount of debt used to finance a takeover\" and \"whether that debt is 'sustainable' and in the wider interests of the game\". That was obviously a reference to the takeovers of Manchester United and Liverpool by north American investors who have borrowed a staggering \u00a31bn altogether, then loaded that debt onto the clubs. That part of the question was studiously avoided by the Premier League yesterday. The fit and proper person test, in truth, is there to protect us from a risk we are extremely unlikely to face. The real issue is that clubs are vulnerable to people who might exploit them, asset strip, or, simply, not have a clue what they are doing. The proposals do not address that broader question. These, overall, are technocratic suggestions by a league and its clubs which have become more professional and responsible in their attitudes over the years, but they fall short of Burnham's plea for them to reassess their relationship with money, in the wider interests of the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
