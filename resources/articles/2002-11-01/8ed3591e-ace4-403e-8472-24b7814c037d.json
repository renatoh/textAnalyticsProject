He cut through the bureaucracy of the FA to modernise the organisation, reducing the power of various committees and the full council to concentrate the decision-making process around the executive board. That did not endear him to some county FA officials and he was also accused by members of the professional game of being too autocratic and not consulting them about commercial matters affecting their clubs. Why did this latest controversy erupt? The Premier League members of the FA's executive board are unhappy that the FA's commercial deals have cut across their own interests, especially in the way that England players are used for personal appearances. They are also annoyed at the way deals have been agreed, arguing they were not consulted in advance and claiming Crozier misled them - most notably over the England players' \u00a35m share of these new commercial deals. What does the Premier League want? The Premier League, backed by the Football League, wants to establish a \"professional game board\" to ensure they govern all commercial affairs. They quote the Dutch and German models - and their plan would downgrade the FA to more of an overseer's role in charge of disciplinary matters, the FA Cup and the England team. Who supported Crozier? The England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson supported him through his agent Athole Still, who said Crozier's backing was a \"very significant factor in his ongoing commitment to the national team\". The Arsenal and FA vice-chairman David Dein insisted the FA board must \"ensure the baby is not thrown out with the water\". Who opposed him? Some Premier League chairmen. Crozier's most vocal opponent was Chelsea's Ken Bates, who insists the Scot \"exceeded his authority\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
