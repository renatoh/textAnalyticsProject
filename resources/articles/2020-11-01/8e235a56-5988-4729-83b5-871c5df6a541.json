What Roig saw was a contented, fit and buzzing Nadal move smoothly into the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters \u2013 which he has not won in seven attempts \u2013 where he will play another Spaniard who knows him nearly as well, Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta. Roig says Nadal\u2019s principle gift late in his career is his ability to adapt and that may just help him over the line in Paris at the end of a truly odd season. On Wednesday, he became the fourth player in the Open era to win 1,000 matches. His 1,001st victory wasn\u2019t bad either. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t evolved,\u201d Roig told the ATP website, \u201cit would have been difficult to stay in a position to win [20] grand slam tournaments. Before, his youth allowed him to play in a more repetitive fashion, with less variation and a mobility I have not seen in anyone. But he was aware his game needed to evolve. Doing that when you\u2019re No 1 in the world is complicated.\u201d Nadal is as adept at the net as he is at the baseline and he showed Thompson that flair for risk-taking to great advantage in a first set that lasted barely half an hour. If there had been an audience, they would have been whispering in the dark about a wipeout. It was then the struggle began. Thompson, who honed his craft in a longer-than-expected run on the Challenger Tour (he won 52 matches there in 2018), went shot for shot with Nadal, forcing the Spaniard to save a string of set points and then settle for the tie-break with a delightful backhand volley that wrong-footed the 26-year-old Sydney-sider. In the shootout, the difference between them was marginal until a fluffed backhand at the net cost Thompson parity. Nadal, crossing at 4-2, found the gears to finish him off after an hour and half of an entertaining tussle. The winners came in a steady torrent across the court and Nadal pressured a final mistake on the backhand from Thompson. \u201cI had a great first set and in the second he started to serve well,\u201d Nadal said, \u201cbut I found a way to win the tie-break. \u201cEveryone feels different at 34 than 18. I\u2019m still passionate, I enjoy what I am doing and I hope to keep playing as long as possible.\u201d As for the challenge Carre\u00f1o Busta poses, he said: \u201cI had some tough battles against him. He\u2019s a great player \u2013 semi-finals at the US Open, quarter-finals at Roland Garros.\u201d All that said, Nadal will be a warm favourite to reach the semi-finals for the second time. The only previous time he got within sight of the final was last year when he handed Denis Shapovalov an injury walkover. Ugo Humbert\u2019s ascent continues pleasingly. The young French left-hander outlasted Marin Cilic over nearly two and a half hours to win 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-3 on Court Central \u2013 his eighth victory in a row. He plays Milos Raonic in the quarter-finals. \u201cCilic is a great champion,\u201d Humbert said, \u201cbut no pressure. I\u2019m enjoying every moment on the court. That\u2019s why I am very relaxed. I work every day. It was really hard when the Tour was stopped, so I am happy to be here, nice feeling to win at Bercy.\u201d Alex de Minaur, whose rise has stuttered, found Daniil Medvedev too strong over three sets and the Russian moves into the quarter-finals against Diego Schwartzman buoyed by his 20th win of the season. If Schwartzman reaches the last four, he makes the final eight for the ATP World Tour Finals in London this month. The Argentinian beat the Spanish qualifier Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-1, 6-1. \u201cHe made just five unforced errors,\u201d Medvedev observed of Schwartzman\u2019s performance. \u201cHe has been on fire this year. I am looking forward to it.\u201d But Schwartzman has lost all their three matches; it should be close."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
