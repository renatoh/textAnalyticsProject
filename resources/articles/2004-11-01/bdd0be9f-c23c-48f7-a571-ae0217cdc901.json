From twice taking pliers to a television cable that ran \"suspiciously close\" to his dug-out to standing on the touchline and screaming \"old, old, more than old\" at Fernando Hierro, a man more than 30 years his junior, his actions have often been nonsensical. As, indeed, they were on Wednesday night. Just when it was opportune, necessary even, for Spain's coach to comment he did not. For the first time since the harangue on Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes in which he referred to Thierry Henry as a \"black shit\" Aragon\u00e9s refused to say anything. By refusing to express condemnation or even sadness at the chants, by the wry grin that stretched across his face, he did little to prove himself not a racist. Nor to heal a rift which he and many of his fellow countrymen believe is of English making. Even more striking was the reaction of the Fernando Garrido, the Spanish Football Federation's (RFEF) director of external relations. Sitting next to Aragon\u00e9s in a packed and bristling press room after the game, Garrido insisted that the RFEF would not be making a statement, self-importantly and irrelevantly reiterating that the decision to pose behind a United Against Racism banner had been taken before the game. Eventually, piqued by vociferous insistence, Garrido shot back: \"There hasn't been any chanting at black players for years and tonight there is. Do you wonder about your own responsibility?\" Like Aragon\u00e9s, he had failed to make a simple statement and left the RFEF open to further accusations. As Bego\u00f1a S\u00e1nchez, a spokeswoman for the anti-racist group SOS, said: \"The federaci\u00f3n is clearly less sensitive towards racism and xenophobia than other European associations.\" Which is, of course, true. Just as it is true that, despite the protestations, monkey chants are still common in Spanish grounds. As Spain's best-selling newspaper Marca put it yesterday morning: \"Every time Wright-Phillips got the ball you could clearly hear that sadly characteristic murmur you get in football stadiums when a coloured player gets the ball.\" Yet it is also true that, in its intensity and numbers, Wednesday night's monkey chanting was unique. It is common among small sections of the ground - like Madrid's Ultra Sur where Francoist flags, bomber jackets and swastikas jostle for prominence - but this time the chants were not limited to the South End. And that is, at least in part, a product of the battle between the British and Spanish over the past few days. The Spanish media have attacked the English for deliberately looking to wind Aragon\u00e9s up. They, by contrast, have played the issue down: the volume was lowered to disguise the chants on Wednesday's TVE coverage and with exceptions such as El Pa\u00eds, yesterday's papers gave it little attention. Likewise, news bulletins shake their heads at the intensity of English interest and sensibility. The night before the game, El Largero , the massively successful late-night radio show on Cadena SER, invited the national coach on to explain how he had shrugged off the pesky English. The presenter then launched a staggeringly bitter attack on the English journalist who asked the question that prompted the now infamous colonies rant, who he said had \"come here with that shaven-headed hooligan look of his to cause trouble\". By Wednesday many Spaniards had made up their minds: it was our Luis against the English. The Bernab\u00e9u had rarely been so loud; the Spanish team had never had such vociferous support in Madrid. But it wasn't just our Luis against the English: it was our Luis against their blacks. Irritated that the arch hooligans should preach about how to behave, some decided on an attitude of \"you want racist, we'll show you racist\". The behaviour of the crowd was as nonsensical as that of Aragon\u00e9s: a \"Stop Immigration\" banner, monkey noises and chants of \"whoever doesn't bounce is a fucking black\" as almost the whole stadium bounded up and down were designed for English consumption. As, of course, were chants of \" Gibraltar, Espa\u00f1ol \". It was telling, and sad, that ooh-oohing was considered a legitimate weapon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
