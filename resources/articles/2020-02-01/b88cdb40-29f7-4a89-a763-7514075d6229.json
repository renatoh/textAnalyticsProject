The Argentinian arrived at White Hart Lane last summer on loan, one of the pieces in Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s plans to rejuvenate the team. In January he signed a five-year permanent contract to play under the management of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. A lot can change quickly in football. \u201cRight now I\u2019m really enjoying the moment of being at such a big club like Spurs,\u201d says Lo Celso, sitting comfortably at Tottenham\u2019s top-of-the-range training facility. \u201cIn the beginning it wasn\u2019t so easy for me. I was coming to a new league, a new language, a new culture, and then I got injured shortly after arriving. But right now I couldn\u2019t feel better.\u201d Lo Celso arrived with a reputation as a goalscoring playmaker, perhaps earmarked as the successor to Christian Eriksen, whom the club had hoped and failed to move on last summer. Just as he was bedding in, however, Lo Celso sustained a hip injury on international duty and missed the best part of two months. By the time he had recovered, Pochettino had left the club and Mourinho was installed. They are two coaches with different philosophies but Lo Celso had prior experience of being adaptable in order to succeed. \u201cOver my career I have played in a variety of positions because my managers have asked me,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I\u2019m at Tottenham and since being here I have already played wide, I\u2019ve played centrally as well. The important thing for me is always to do the best I can for the team and to respond to the requests of my coach, and above all it\u2019s crucial for me to be happy out on the pitch.\u201d As for comparisons with the now departed Eriksen, Lo Celso is polite but hardly seeks to encourage them. \u201cChristian is a great player and I have seen that through the months I have spent with him here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the end of the day the club and Eriksen both came to a decision that it was right for a change. So I try not to compare myself to him.\u201d It is perhaps this hard-headed attitude that has helped Lo Celso to impress his current manager. The Argentinian, a technical player who stands at 5ft 10in, is not a stereotypical Mourinho man but the Spurs manager was effusive about him after a dominant performance against Southampton in the FA Cup fourth round. \u201cWith me in the first couple of weeks he understood what we want \u2013 he is a good learner, a good kid,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt has been an incredible evolution since I arrived.\u201d Part of the evolution has been positional, with Lo Celso increasingly dropping away from that Eriksen-shaped hole behind the striker (one occupied by Dele Alli) and into central midfield where he has played alongside Harry Winks. Against Norwich in Spurs\u2019 last Premier League match, Lo Celso was dominant in that area, asserting his full range of passing but also showing a willingness for the physical challenges that role provides, and an alacrity in getting about the pitch. It was also from deep that the 23-year-old began his slaloming run against Southampton, one in which he beat five players on the way to setting up Son Heung-min\u2019s goal in a 1-1 draw. Next up for Spurs is a real test of their top-four ambitions as they host Manchester City on Sunday. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s going to be a really difficult match against a team with fantastic players who have been at the top of the game for the last few years,\u201d Lo Celso says. \u201cBut for us it\u2019s really important to win and to put a good performance out there and take home the three points. We\u2019re at a big club. We\u2019ve got high expectations. We go out to win all our matches. Now, of course, we are coming up against a big opponent but we know we have all the weapons to hurt them and win the match.\u201d Mourinho and Pochettino may have their stylistic differences but both are bullish men and, listening to Lo Celso speak, one can hear why both managers have taken a shine to him. Now that his long-term future at Tottenham has been secured he can concentrate on leaving his mark on the club. \u201cThere have been many Argentinians in the past at Tottenham and they have left a great imprint on the club here,\u201d Lo Celso says with a smile. \u201cThe fans still talk about [Ossie] Ardiles and [Ricky] Villa and, of course, Mauricio Pochettino carried that on for so many years. Now it\u2019s up to us to continue this tradition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
