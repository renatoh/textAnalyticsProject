Whatever happens, I\u2019ve got your back'", "bodyText": "Names: Phoebe and Toby Adams Years together: 14 Occupations: marketing and urban researcher Phoebe and Toby Adams are on the kind of journey that inspires equal parts awe and trepidation. The couple are driving from Sydney to Perth, along with their three girls \u2013 an 11-year-old and one-year-old twins. Over the next four months, they will travel across New South Wales, through South Australia, north to the Flinders Ranges, to Coober Pedy, Alice Springs and Katherine, then down to Broome and finally land in Perth, where they will settle and set up their lives afresh. It\u2019s an impressive trip under any circumstances but throw in a global pandemic, border closures and a month living in a caravan park as preparation, and it\u2019s truly astonishing. Yet they\u2019re relaxed about it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very flexible mindset,\u201d Toby says. \u201cIf things change with borders, we\u2019ll need to alter our routes but that\u2019s all part of the journey, really.\u201d The move is part of a major life shift for the family. Until recently, they lived on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches and, each day, Toby would spend about two-and-a-half hours commuting to the city. It robbed them of precious family time and a decent work-life balance. \u201cWhen the twins were really little, he hardly saw them during the week,\u201d Phoebe says. \u201cSo being able to have him fulltime is really exciting.\u201d While it was something they had been considering, the coronavirus pandemic spurred them on. And, if the pictures are anything to go by, they are having the time of their lives. They met 24 years ago while at university in Western Australia, introduced by a mutual friend. Both 19, they dated for a while but things came to an end when Phoebe returned home to Sydney after finishing her studies. Over the next 10 years, they kept in touch, still drawn together. \u201cThere\u2019s something about our personalities which is very aligned,\u201d Toby says. \u201cWe\u2019re fun-loving and inquiring. And I think there\u2019s some sort of connection around being adventurous and trying new things.\u201d But somehow the timing was never right. That is, until one night, while Phoebe was in London and Toby in Melbourne, they were chatting and realised they were both single at the same time. \u201cSo we sort of decided over the phone that we would get together,\u201d Phoebe says. Suddenly it was full-steam ahead. Phoebe returned from London and moved in with Toby in Melbourne. They moved to Sydney a few years later and then Phoebe fell pregnant. With a nudge from Phoebe\u2019s mother, they decided to get married before their daughter arrived. Phoebe says: \u201cIt was like \u2018Of course. This is what we are going to do\u2019. It was a natural progression, it felt like the right thing to do.\u201d And it was a \u201cmagnificent\u201d wedding. New city, new baby, new marriage \u2013 and a new job for Toby. It was a whirlwind, but all the excitement wasn\u2019t smooth sailing. Particularly for Phoebe. \u201cI was adjusting to this new life of being a mum, and being very career-focused before then, suddenly [questioning] what does that mean for my career?\u201d She went back to work when her daughter was nine months old. It was tough juggling everything. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for new mums. If you are career driven, you have to make so many little micro-decisions about prioritisation and I think that marriage is such a big part of that life,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone said to me at that point that parents with young children should not be allowed to divorce because there\u2019s so much pressure on you. And it\u2019s true.\u201d All that stress took a toll on their relationship and they separated for about a year. Being there for their daughter helped them to find their way back together. \u201cWe both missed her terribly when we didn\u2019t have her,\u201d Toby says, \u201cand it was a time when Bea was just about to start school and we could see just how tricky this custody thing was going to be.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe were like, \u2018What are we doing? Let\u2019s just get back together, let\u2019s sort out what issues we have\u2019, which actually weren\u2019t too fundamental really.\u201d They decided to renew their vows to mark the significance of their decision \u2013 but kept things simple. Same location, same marriage celebrant but just one guest and their daughter did the reading. \u201c[It was important] to put that line in the sand. That was the old marriage, this is the new marriage, and this is what we want for each other,\u201d Phoebe says. \u201cAnd a big part of it was saying \u2018I\u2019ve got your back. Whatever happens, I\u2019ve got your back.\u2019 And it\u2019s true, if I think about Tobes and the way that he treats me as his wife and the mother [of our children], that that is always evident. I really feel that.\u201d Being apart made them stronger, she says: \u201cWe can get through anything now, and it wouldn\u2019t break us up. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t think that would ever get us to that point, because we\u2019ve seen the other side and we don\u2019t want to be separate. We want to be together.\u201d They wanted more children and, when their twins eventually arrived, it made them reassess their priorities again. \u201c[We realised] we can\u2019t always operate with one person working at a 150% capacity and me trying to pull it all together at the other end. We talked about that a lot. Even though Tobes is very focused on his career, he\u2019s also very focused on family. And so he could see that that was important,\u201d Phoebe says. \u201cAnd for me, that was probably the biggest challenge. Getting us to the same page where it was like, \u2018OK, what\u2019s important here?\u2019\u201d It was in planning for the future that the idea of moving to Perth came up \u2013 many of Toby\u2019s friends and family live there. \u201cIt unfolded that we wanted to be in a more relaxed place or state of mind and for Tobes to be working less away from the family,\u201d Phoebe says. \u201cSo that prompted a lot of decisions.\u201d Then the pandemic hit, which meant Toby was working from home and helping out with the children even more, as well as cutting out his lengthy commute. It spurred their decision on. He says: \u201cThat period gave us a good taste of how things could be on the road, and how we can manage a bit better with work-life balance.\u201d Life on the road, and living in a camper van with three young children, has its own challenges, but the couple have learnt how to negotiate daily niggles. \u201cWe get it out in the open pretty quickly ... There\u2019s never any hard feeling, we never hold onto stuff,\u201d Phoebe says. When subtle messages aren\u2019t getting through, they have learnt to speak up and the other will listen. And while there\u2019s still the occasional clash, they are quick to move on. They try to find moments together like a cup of tea in the morning or a glass of wine at the end of the day, although both wish there was more time for romance. It\u2019s something they discuss. \u201c[We\u2019re] checking in with each other and we\u2019re very affectionate naturally. So we\u2019re always hugging and kissing, and that is always there whatever\u2019s happening,\u201d Phoebe says. \u201cI think that is a way that we keep the romance alive. We\u2019re not just best friends living together.\u201d Reassessing their priorities has made them realise what\u2019s most important: \u201cFor me, family is everything,\u201d Phoebe says. \u201cWe really work hard to make sure that we show up for each other.\u201d Of course \u201cwe don\u2019t nail it all the time, but I think we\u2019re pretty good\u201d. As their world shifts from one side of the country to another, they are treasuring the precious time with the girls \u2013 like when everyone piles into the camper bed. \u201cIt\u2019s a camping trailer bed that we zip up so no one can fall out,\u201d Phoebe laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a bit more relaxing, actually.\u201d That spirit of play is something they hold dear. \u201cLaughter, humour and having some fun \u2026 I\u2019m always looking to get a laugh out of Phoebs. I just find that endless mission both enjoyable but also important for us.\u201d \u2022 We want to hear your stories about staying together.
