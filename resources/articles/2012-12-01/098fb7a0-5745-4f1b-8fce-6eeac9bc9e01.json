Earlier this year it emerged that Phillippa Williamson, the SFO's former chief executive, was handed more than \u00a3450,000 when she left, despite the fact that Richard Alderman, the organisation's director, had not cleared the deal with ministers. In a written ministerial statement, Grieve said: \"A further redundancy agreement was entered into by Richard Alderman and will take effect in December 2012 when Christian Bailes's post as chief operating officer is made redundant \u2026 the cost to the SFO is likely to be in the range of \u00a3450,000 to \u00a3475,000.\" The details were exposed following questions from Labour's shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry. She said: \"This is one of the most appalling misuses of taxpayers' money I have ever come across. Clearly, we need regular independent inspections of the SFO, but what we also need right now is to get to the bottom of what has been going on there. Who knew what about these payments and when? What questions were asked at the time and what questions should have been asked? Is it really the case that none of these payments can be clawed back?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
