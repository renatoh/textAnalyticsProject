Giorgos Samaras took up the Fulham midfielder\u2019s mantle and flatly denied there was unrest in the camp. The show of harmony was going so well until the former Celtic striker defended the defensive style that won Greece the 2004 European Championships and outlined his manager\u2019s vision to \u201cjust defend well and score one goal, that\u2019s it.\u201d Said manager, Fernando Santos, looked at Samaras, waved his finger and interjected: \u201cThat is not what I said. That is not what I said.\u201d Something may have been lost in translation and Santos\u2019s irritation was aimed more at a journalist who relayed Samaras\u2019s comment than at the player himself. But having dismissed rumours of a split in the squad ever since the vice-captain Kostas Katsouranis and Giannis Maniatis almost came to blows in a Greek Cup semi-final last season, another denial \u2013 and the subject matter \u2013 was not what Santos needed before Saturday\u2019s difficult opening game against Colombia. The Greece coach is clearly sensitive on the playing style that brought unprecedented success to the country under Otto Rehhagel but has won few neutral admirers given its continuation since 2004. \u201cDefence is not the most important feature of Greece,\u201d insisted Santos. \u201cThe most important feature is Greece and the team itself. If we only played defensively we would lose.\u201d Later, Samaras elaborated: \u201cWe have our way of playing and we have not changed from the style that has borne fruit in recent years. As the coach said it very eloquently, football is simple; you just have to defend your goal and score one goal. That\u2019s it. In that sense I fully agree. \u201cWe have our approach, our philosophy and our way of playing and hopefully we will be competitive throughout the World Cup.\u201d That prompted the intervention from Santos, although should Colombia sense fracture in their opponents they should bear in mind the impassioned words of Karagounis, Greece\u2019s most-capped player. \u201cIn recent months we have shown our big advantage is that we play as a team on the pitch and outside of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn good moments and not so good moments we are always together. We are a close group. The starting XI against Colombia and the bench are one team. We trust in each other, and that is why I trust Giorgos to score tomorrow!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
