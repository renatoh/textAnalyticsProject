With the government adamant that higher education should pay its way, Cambridge has become the latest university to close a course. Seemingly out of the blue, the vice-chancellor's department last week announced that the Part II diploma in architecture was to be axed. As a result, this once-great architecture school no longer has the capacity to turn out qualified architects, but will instead see them through only to the end of their three-year undergraduate course before sending them elsewhere to become the finished article. The move has left architecture academics dismayed. For a school that has a list of alumni perhaps bettered only by the highly influential Bartlett and Architectural Association schools in London, the decision will come as a real shock. Any list of the school's former students will include some of the most significant architects working in Britain today: Colin St John Wilson, the man behind the new British Library, was there, as were Sir Richard Macormac, currently redeveloping the BBC's Broadcasting House and Eric Parry, recently appointed to rethink Trafalgar Square's St-Martin-in-the-Fields church. The closure will serve as a wake-up call to other universities. If Cambridge can no longer afford a department, then the clock must surely be ticking elsewhere. It will also set alarm bells ringing throughout the profession, as any apparent academic devaluation of architecture - especially at one of the top universities - is bound to have a knock-on effect. The reasons behind the university's decision are many and varied, but not as unexpected as one might have first thought. The first sign that there was something wrong came with the publication of the results of 2002's Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) which saw the school fall from a 5-star rating to 4, depriving it of more than \u00a3200,000 in research funding. More to the point, however, the RAE also radically affected the school's relationship with its university masters. The school of architecture believes the vice-chancellor's department has always been suspicious of a professional training course, preferring, in other similar subjects such as engineering, to back the academic undergraduate courses and allow the \"professions themselves to look after professional training\". And when the school of architecture lost its premier research status last year, the university began to question the value of keeping the Part II course going at all. Another portion of blame has been placed at the door of the Architects Registration Board, the government's architectural standards regulator. The ARB has the power of life and death over schools in the UK. Together with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), it decides which should win \"prescription\": the power to educate officially recognised architects. The ARB is not an easy taskmaster. At the beginning of this year, it withdrew prescription from De Montfort University's school of architecture because it felt it wasn't up to scratch, a move that caused havoc in the school and left students with qualifications worth less than the paper they were written on. Cambridge was never under threat of losing its recognised status, but like many schools in the UK, it had become increasingly frustrated with the hassle and cost of meeting the ARB's increasingly demanding standards. Alan Short, head of school, admitted that this was an important factor in its decision to close the course. \"After close consideration of the ARB's new criteria for Part II, the department concluded very reluctantly that it is unable to resource the delivery of the university's research aspirations,\" he said. The chief concern among architecture academics is that Cambridge's decision reflects a trend in other universities. RIBA's education boss, Jack Pringle, believes it could be the tip of the iceberg, warning that there could soon be no place for architectural education in the top universities. \"The competition for the government's research money is white-hot at the moment,\" Pringle said. \"The vice-chancellors in the Russell Group are looking at under-performing departments and asking what is wrong with them. What they don't seem to understand is that the schools have a real problem. The research that they do is not understood by the RAE panel as there is nobody involved with the procedure that has even a basic understanding of design research.\" But he also warned that not all the blame can be passed on to others. \"We need to present the work we do in a different way and persuade the government to change the way it dishes out research cash. Schools also need to carry out more work with industry and with other disciplines, as well. \"We need to stand up and really fight our corner. Architecture is an enormously important issue for society and we must not be afraid to defend it. What the experience of Cambridge shows us is that we have to be careful to ensure that the tradition of architectural education continues in this country's best universities.\" Eric Parry, a former teacher at the school, described the decision to close the course as \"very sad\". \"The research ratings system is completely off the mark and at odds with what is best for architecture,\" he said. \"As a result, there seems to have been a cash shortfall. The Cambridge school has a completely different attitude to other schools that do diplomas; it had a kind of training that architecture will surely miss.\" Stephen Greenburg, another former teacher and a director of London-based practice Metaphor, agreed. \"When I think of the people it has produced, it is a real shame,\" he said. \"People should look at why this has happened and try to learn lessons. If Cambridge can be forced to shut its diploma course, then other schools should sit up and take note.\" Cambridge is adamant that its highly regarded graduate offshoot, the Martin Centre, is safe, as are its more respected postgraduate courses. \"The department will concentrate on its three very successful MPhil courses and its growing community of research students,\" Alan Short explained. \"And we propose to introduce a fourth MPhil in urban, regional and transportation planning within the next two years, consolidating its very successful graduate school.\" The only question is whether this will be enough, Pringle warned. \"It seems increasingly clear that unless there is a step-change in the way research is assessed, the top universities will simply lose interest.\" \u00b7 Ed Dorrell is senior reporter for Architects Journal"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
