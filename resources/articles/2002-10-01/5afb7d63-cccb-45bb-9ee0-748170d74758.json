Ask your colleagues what the initials USS stand for. If you're in America (the coffee, in my experience, will taste better) try the same test with TIAA/CREF. For certain, the minority who can answer correctly will be grey-haired or shiny-pated. Lustrous locks correlate with ignorance on this subject - important as it is. There is a threshold in the academic career when you \"understand\" pensions. Just like that old Pearl advertisement that went through cartoon panels, representing the five stations of professional life - from the young man's airy \"they tell me there's no pension\" (who gives a toss? I hope I die before I get old) to a wizened oldster's croaking \"I don't know what I'll do without a pension\" (the workhouse looms). I'm in the somewhat unusual situation of having passed large sections of my career in the British and the American systems. I shall have two pensions (four if you count the respective state doles). They arise from entirely different philosophies about how retirement should be paid for. Which is the better system, UK or US? I'll lay out my situation and you can decide (better have a second cup of coffee). The British scheme (USS) is a function of salary. Over the years something just under a fifth of your earnings have been salted away. Invisible gnomes invest it for you. You have no control about how. Compound interest does its magic. When you hit 65 (sad moment, Professor Chips) you will get one-eightieth of your highest recent salary, times the number of years you have served, plus three times the annual pensionable income \"in hand\". My highest salary when I reach the buffers (soon, alas) will be, I estimate, GBP64K. I will have served 32 years. That will give me an annual pension (mildly indexed, annuitised, and with a half-value for my widow, should I go first) of \u00a325K (ish). Plus a \u00a375K (tax-free) golden handshake. It will be what, in the 19th century was called \"half-pay\". It's safe, but not particularly generous. If you factor in the UK state pension I shall be getting an income of something more than \u00a332K. Just about enough to keep you in sheltered accommodation, should that misfortune happen. Not really enough for the golden years dolce vita. And, the irritating thing is, the insurance companies will have made a killing (ominous word) out of my hard-earned income (particularly if I drop off my perch soon after retirement). Those invisible gnomes, for a certainty, drive a better car than I do. Sod them. I worked for 10 years in the American system. When you go in full-time you have to decide what proportion of your pension should go into risky equities, and what proportion into safe blue-chip investment. Do you feel lucky, punk? You are much more in control than in the UK. Most, like me, take the \"pussy\" option: 50% TIAA, 50% CREF. But many of my high-rolling colleagues in the booming 1980s and 90s went for all CREF. Over the years I worked in America (1983 to 1993) Wall Street went wild. CREF was returning more than 20% a year - TIAA plugged in at about 5% to 10% (TIAA/CREF has the reputation of being the best managed fund in America). My salary over these years went from around $60K to $120K (why the hell did I ever leave?). TIAA/CREF is a much more flexible system than the UK's. You can take it any time from 62 onwards (you have to take it at 72). America, of course, does not have mandatory retirement at 65.You can take your TIAA/CREF in a lump sum, an annuity (don't touch it, wise heads advise) or in a whole range of draw-down and mixed options (ensuring, if you're philanthropic, that your survivors get their share). You define how your money is invested and how it is returned to you. The coffee room advice is: when you go, make sure the last dollar buys your coffin. It's your cash; take it, spend it - every goddamn cent. Drive a good car to the cemetery. But what is the bottom line? The rule of thumb with TIAA/CREF is that the pay-off is a seventh of the pot, if you retire at 65. That pot, of course, is dependent on how you (the owner) have invested it. Mine, after 10 years, when (in 1999) the Dow was touching 11,000 was $400K. Since those bastards Bush and Osama have kicked the hell out of stocks and shares it's sunk to $299K. I'll wait till it goes up, then cash in my chips. With luck, on 10 years' work, it should give me a bit more than 30 years of the UK's USS - a notional $50K through my grey and golden decades (may you live forever, reader, and may I weep at your funeral). American social security has it over Britain's state pension every time. The only catch in America is that you have to have worked 40 quarters (10 years - yippee). I'll get \u00a36K from the UK, and $12K from America's SS. But I can take the money any time (with a bonus if you wait) and, thanks to Bill Clinton (God bless him!) I don't have to wait until I retire. I'm collecting it now. That's the wise-head advice. What's the better system? A no-brainer, as they say. America wins. The mix of safe and risky pay-in, the flexibility about pay-off and the sense that (as an intelligent human being) you are in charge of your own funds are surely preferable. They manage things better across the Atlantic. As for those initials - USS, TIAA/CREF? Wait until you're 55. And if you're 55-plus, you won't have to ask. But if you must know now, USS - University Superannuation Scheme - TIAA/CREF - Teachers Insurance and Annuities Association, College Retirement Equities Fund."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
