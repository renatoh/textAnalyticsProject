Or perhaps \u201cgood\u201d isn\u2019t the best word; maybe \u201crare\u201d is better. He\u2019s the person I go to with titles of Australian films that never got a release on DVD or video and can\u2019t be purchased online. I don\u2019t know how he finds them and I don\u2019t ask any questions. This modern-day Santa figure introduced me to the lofty highs of the 1992 Hey Hey It\u2019s Saturday! telemovie Silence of the Hams, starring Daryl Somers as a hardboiled detective and Red Symons as a Chinese villain (you read that right) complete with Fu Manchu moustache. If pressed, my movie dealer talks modestly about his collection \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t have everything,\u201d he\u2019ll say \u2013 but it\u2019s clear he has one hell of a library. Ozflix, the world\u2019s first streaming provider to offer only Australian films, officially launched on Thursday. In a sense, the pay-per-view platform is the antithesis of my obscure movies dealer: its selection is poor but it says it has everything. The company\u2019s official motto is \u201cEvery Aussie movie. Ever\u201d \u2013 a bizarre choice of words given that it launched with just 200-odd titles. Ozflix has announced it will expand its library over time but even then the objective of obtaining every Australian film in existence is pretty much impossible. There are several reasons for this, including issues surrounding rights and availability. And that\u2019s before we even start considering ultra-esoteric stuff like Silence of the Hams that nobody \u2013 not even their creators \u2013 tends to care about. But, hey, given the terrible underfunding of the National Film and Sound Archive, which has taken to crowdfunding to boost its coffers, one can hardly condemn Ozflix for entertaining such ambitions. One of the platform\u2019s commendable features is its decision to hand 50% of all sales to the distributor or film-maker. Film-makers successful in securing major distribution probably won\u2019t notice the difference, but for pauperised artists whose work may have fallen through the cracks, it is a significant incentive. Hopefully Ozflix will fill some of those gaps. It is preposterous \u2013 to use only one example \u2013 that Australians have been unable to legally obtain a copy of the 2015 Queensland-made black comedy The Suicide Theory. In the US you could see it at the cinema, buy a copy of the DVD from Walmart or stream it on Netflix. None of those options were \u2013 or are \u2013 available for the people in its home country. The size of the cut given to artists and rights holders is not, of course, something the general public give a flying fig about \u2013 certainly not if it means they have to pay more for their movies. Fortunately this is not necessarily the case. Ozflix has two prices: $6.79 for new releases and $3.79 for everything else. Renting Mad Max: Fury Road will set you back $3.79. iTunes offers the same film for $6.99 and Google Play for $5.99. In this case, the new kid on the block presents a substantial saving. For other films it is less competitive. Ozflix\u2019s \u201cnew stuff\u201d section is populated by titles just added to the service rather than new releases per se, which means users are sometimes required to pay a higher price for old content. The 2007 creature feature Black Water is $6.79 to rent on Ozflix, versus $3.99 on iTunes and Google Play. The general public are likely to find that price, for a decade-old film, a bit steep \u2013 though they have never been reasonable on such matters. The same people who fork out eight bucks at a pub for a glass of white that tastes like cat piss will squawk about how $5 is too much to pay for two hours of entertainment. One of the challenges Ozflix faces is how to \u201csell the sizzle\u201d of Australian film in ways that don\u2019t reflect the cultural cringe-induced idea that our cinema is a \u201clittle industry that could\u201d. Thus the introduction of some original content to the platform: a small range of programs that highlight different titles in the catalogue. Ozflix is unlikely to sell the sizzle, or sell anything at all, in its flagship program, FAQ, which is essentially a long sit-down with key talent. The first episode is an hour and a half conversation with John Jarratt. It begins like a live-action adaptation of an IMDb page, the host rattling off a long list of titles the actor has worked on with no commentary other than the year of release and the name of the director. This goes on for almost three minutes. Audiences no longer have that kind of patience; certainly not online. There are also some technical bugs. When I tried to reload FAQ it wouldn\u2019t play on my desktop computer (\u201cthe device or the screen does not support content protection\u201d), nor did it work on my tablet. Some teething issues, however, are surely inevitable with this kind of service. Other than these glitches, the user experience was pretty good and the interface uncluttered and Netflix-y. With time Ozflix could become highly valuable, particularly if it is able to showcase work unavailable elsewhere. Here\u2019s hoping the platform builds a library comparable to my guy in Melbourne. Who knows: the Silence of the Hams might one day return to our screens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
