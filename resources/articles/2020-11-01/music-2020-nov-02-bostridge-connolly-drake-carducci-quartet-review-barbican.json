Yet in this Barbican concert with the tenor Ian Bostridge and mezzo Sarah Connolly, along with the pianist Julius Drake and the Carducci Quartet, any feeling of being stuck on a musical byway fell away and one wondered why more composers have not written for this interesting and rewarding combination. Vaughan Williams\u2019s song cycle On Wenlock Edge, his 1909 setting of six of AE Housman\u2019s A Shropshire Lad poems, is one of the few pieces originally written for such forces. The writing owes much to the composer\u2019s studies with Ravel and makes a compelling case, exploiting the possibilities of its fast-changing mix of string textures, underpinned with the sonorousness of the piano, particularly effective in On Bredon Hill and well brought out by Drake\u2019s authoritative touch. In Bostridge it also had an interpreter whose attention to the detail and structure of Housman\u2019s melancholy texts was exemplary, even though some of this tenor\u2019s sound will always divide opinion. You really could hear the horses\u2019 harness jingle in Is My Team Ploughing, but Bostridge ensured there was no mistaking the underlying bleakness and, in the final song Clun, the bitterness of the cycle. Ernest Chausson\u2019s Po\u00e8me de l\u2019Amour et de la Mer sets overwrought and inferior verses by Maurice Bouchor. Originally written for a lush post-Wagnerian orchestra, it was expertly performed by Connolly, Drake and the Carduccis in a fine new arrangement by Franck Villard, which somehow manages to maintain the compelling surge of the original. Emma Denton stood out with some fine cello solos, but it was Connolly\u2019s vocal bloom and control, especially evident as she lingered over the poet\u2019s invocation of eternal oblivion, that crowned the performance. An equally classy encore, in the shape of Faur\u00e9\u2019s perfumed duet Pleurs d\u2019Or, in an arrangement by Iain Farrington, brought all the performers and all the elements of a thoroughly rewarding evening elegantly together. \u2022 Our reviewer watched the live stream of this concert."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
