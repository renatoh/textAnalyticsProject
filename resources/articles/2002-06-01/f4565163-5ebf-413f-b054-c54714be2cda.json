The venerable Football 365, now part of a merged operation with Rivals.net, has been baiting Neil Henderson, a presenter on Teamtalk's radio arm Teamtalk 252, for his views on Argentina. Henderson responded by calling it a \"tinpot site\" and challenged the editor on air to apologise for his comments. Football 365 has in turn retaliated with a poll offering readers the chance to vote on whether Henderson should be allowed to have the right of reply in a one-off column. But Diary hears that Henderson, who presents the drivetime show on the troubled radio station (currently in the process of being sold to UKBetting), is consulting his lawyers... \u00b7 All is far from rosy in the world of online sports journalism. Teamtalk is having concerns of another kind over its mass bout of redundancies designed to cut spiralling running costs. Staff are threatening to go on strike right in the middle of the World Cup over the terms offered to the 75 people made redundant. Diary is also hearing rumblings from the 50 or so staff made redundant recently by Sports.com, which is also up for sale after going into administration. The upshot of which is that there's going to be a glut of very disgruntled sports journalists looking for work right in the middle of the busiest sports summer for years. \u00b7 It seems that the Times' snazzy new online registration system is not as secure as it would have you believe. Overseas readers of TimesOnline.co.uk are now supposed to pay a \u00a340 subscription to read articles and access the archive. But one plucky American, a contributor to irreverent IT news site The Register, found a way around the system in just 10 minutes. By registering from a proxy server, and essentially fooling the Times site into believing he was accessing the site from the UK, he was able to surf the site gratis. \"I do hope the Times is a good deal more diligent with the credit card data they collect from subscribers,\" he says, quite rightly. Expect several more similar horror stories as the rush to introduce subscription services hots up. \u00b7 BT Openworld has been on something of a marketing and PR offensive in recent weeks as it attempts to corner the market in broadband before another arm of the same company - BT Retail - launches its own offering against it in the summer. The weirdest aspect of this concerted push is the ISP's decision to sponsor a couple of cows in the upcoming CowParade. Which, if you're interested, is an exhibition of 250 mechanical cows starting today and continuing for two weeks in the name of modern art. One, \"Cowmoonication\", features hundreds of digital images of human facial features while the other will be fully internet enabled. Just don't ask why. \u00b7 Owen Gibson is new media editor of MediaGuardian.co.uk owen.gibson@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
