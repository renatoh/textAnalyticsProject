So when he declared in January that WPP had climbed out of the \"bath-shaped\" slump that had plagued the industry for the past few years, the bad times, it seemed, were officially over. Despite continued spats with shareholders over his generous remuneration package, Sir Martin secured WPP's position as one of the few truly global advertising businesses by taking over Cordiant through a tricky series of corporate manoeuvres. He was also able to report WPP's profits for 2003 were up by 18%. Sir Martin is now rated in the MediaGuardian 100 list as the country's ninth most influential figure in the media, a massive increase on his position at 45 last year. But advertising people are thin on the ground in the top 100. Lord Saatchi makes a return at number 53 having added the role of joint chairman of the Conservative party to the job of running his agency, M&amp;C Saatchi. Stef Calcraft (at 79), a partner at Mother, and Johnny Hornby (at 81), the managing partner at Clemmow Hornby Inge, both representing the smaller, more dynamic end of the advertising business, are the only other advertising professionals to make the top 100. Mother has continued to blaze a creative trail and last year picked up some of the biggest clients in the business, including Coca-Cola and Boots. The agency even managed the remarkable feat of persuading Coke to run a British-made commercial on American TV. Mr Hornby, meanwhile, has presided over another remarkable success story. His agency has been responsible for some of the more visible campaigns in recent months, such as the Tango ads and Talk Talk's sponsorship of Big Brother. Trevor Beattie may have slipped out of the top 100 list this year but he's still rated one of the top 10 most influential figures in advertising. The TBWA/London chairman's latest brainwave is to launch the fcuk brand, which he took from relative obscurity into the mainstream, as a radio station. Those responsible for the massive figures spent on commercials each year also make an appearance in advertising's top 10. Nick Manning, the chief executive of OMD UK Group, the Omnicom-owned media agencies, has combined his company's resources to create the UK's largest buying operation, responsible for close to \u00a31bn of advertising a year. Also in the advertising top 10 is Christopher Graham, the director general of the Advertising Standards Authority. Mr Graham was largely responsible for persuading Ofcom to pass the control of TV and radio advertising regulation to the watchdog, making him the ultimate arbiter of taste, decency and fair play in UK advertising. Publicis Groupe chief Maurice Levy, Procter &amp; Gamble's director of media Bernard Balderston and Cilla Snowball, the astute boss of Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, also make it on to the top 10 this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
