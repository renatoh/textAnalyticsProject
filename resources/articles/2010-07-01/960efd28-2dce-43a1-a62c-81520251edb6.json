Bolters always do, particularly when they win titles with hefty chunks of tradition attached. Could it be that you do not need superhuman qualities to win a major? Can Joe Blow really still breeze in from Nowhereville and make off with \u00a3850,000 under the noses of the world's best? The answer, in both cases, would appear to be an Afrikaans\u2011accented \"yes\". Given his pre-tournament odds of 200-1, the hitherto low-profile Mr Oosthuizen has instantly established himself as the hero of downtrodden underdogs worldwide. The truth, of course, is that South Africa's new champion is hardly a Maurice Flitcroft-style chancer. He is, before we get too emotional,a highly talented professional who needed only to hole a few more putts to make a name for himself. His success, even so, creates the illusion that romance still has a place in big-time sport and, for that rare gift, we should be suitably grateful. Imagine, for a second, that Oosthuizen's example were to prove contagious. The new Premier League season could kick off next month with, say, Wolverhampton Wanderers quietly confident of upsetting the elite. The US PGA would be won by the impressive Melbourne-based South young Korean amateur Jin Jeong and Fabio Capello's England, playing nowt but one-touch football, would waltz away with Euro 2012. There are even more fanciful scenarios out there, but right now that'll do. The point is this: the enjoyment of sport, at any level, is always enhanced if the possibilities are endless. But fewer and fewer sports nowadays can make that multi-dimensional boast. Isn't it side-splitting, for example, to listen to the cognoscenti as they harp on about the glorious uncertainty of English domestic football? This is the league where, as in Scotland, a blind man with a pin and a list of the serious contenders would have a 50-50 chance of picking next season's champions. Suspense? It usually falls well short of Hitchcockian, particularly if you live outside London or the north-west. Motor racing? Half a dozen drivers, at best, can win the Formula One title in a given year. Tennis? If you are a woman and your surname is not Williams, forget about winning Wimbledon any time soon. Rugby union? Next year's World Cup in New Zealand is as open as any of its predecessors and yet you will struggle to name more than four nations capable of lifting the Webb Ellis Cup. A healthy state of affairs? Only for those with heads already in the trough. The counter-argument is that the best sport is always based on clearly defined rivalries: Ali v Frazier, Watson v Nicklaus, Borg v McEnroe, Chelsea v Man Utd. There is a fascination in the irresistible force/immovable object dynamic. Yet for team sports, in particular, less does not necessarily mean more. It tends, instead, to spawn an increase in one\u2011sided pool or league games and diminish week-to-week intensity, unless the big fish flounder temporarily. The solution, most notably in gridiron and Australian rules, is a draft system which spreads the talent more easily, or a salary cap which ensures the rich cannot instantly buy success. Rugby union's Premiership, a good example of the latter until the sugar daddies of the French Top 14 tilted the playing field, continues to be more robust as a result. No longer is all the silverware divvied up between a couple of teams, Leicester's continued excellence notwithstanding. Which all helps to explain why the gap-toothed Oosthuizen has done us such a favour. It may have been the dullest last day at an Open in years, but the champ's massive seven-shot margin was hardly his fault. He won his monster cheque fair and square, with some startlingly sweet tee shots. Quantity and quality are supposed to be distant cousins but, boiled down to its essence, this was a dream result for golf's extended family. At long last we can leave Tiger Woods to his own devices and skip down to the driving range humming King Louis's classic signature tune: \"Ooo-bee-doo, I wanna be like you-ooh-ooh \u2026\" In search of a better way to end Spanish domination Good to hear the opinion of Austria's Under-19s coach on England's latest crop of footballers. \"We were the better team and the way we play is the better way,\" sniffed Andreas Heraf after his team's 3-2 defeat in France. Oh dear. The veracity of his opinion will doubtless be confirmed or otherwise when England Under-19s face Holland tomorrow and France this weekend in their remaining group games. It is unfair to expect the youngsters to atone for all the sins of their elders but anything that provides a truer picture of the abilities of England's next generation of English wannabes is to be welcomed. If they flop spectacularly it may even silence those who are already attempting to gloss over the World Cup debacle by insisting, among other things, that Spain has nothing to teach us. Sorry, but this is not the week to start getting uppity. In the wake of Rafael Nadal's Wimbledon victory, there was another notch on the bedpost for Iberian tennis on Sunday when Albert Mont\u00e1\u00f1es won the ATP Mercedes Cup. In addition, Jorge Lorenzo and Dani Pedroza Pedrosa lead the MotoGP standings and Javier G\u00f3mez won the Hamburg triathlon and sits third in the world standings. And Alberto Contador now wears the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. Lady Gaga knew what she was doing when she released Alejandro as a single. Seeing Butt at Lord's is one of life's great pleasures So there we were, happily installed in the top tier of the Edrich Stand at Lord's, for the third day of Pakistan v Australia. Plenty of space to spread out (these neutral Tests have not quite caught the popular imagination), if a little windy. And do you know what I came away thinking? That watching a proper batsman, in this case Salman Butt, construct a proper innings in evening sunshine against determined bowling on the world's most evocative cricket ground remains one of life's great pleasures. As the Twenty20 bandwagon begins to slow and several smaller counties face potential extinction, cricket's guardians should pause to consider precisely what it is that makes the sport special before they embrace a supposedly sexier alternative. Seb Coe's brilliant last-man stand with a pub landlord Cricketing achievement of the month? Step forward Seb Coe \u2013 not that one \u2013 of Sampford Arundel CC in Somerset, who contributed 283 not out in his side's successful chase of 332 to beat touring team Feltham Garrison. The home team won by one wicket thanks to a last wicket stand of 107 between Coe, who hit 18 sixes and 40 fours, and the local pub landlord. Lord Coe himself never contrived such a stunning finish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
