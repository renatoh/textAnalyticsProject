One of 1,600 refugees who have arrived at the Imvepi reception centre in the West Nile region of northern Uganda, she has finally made it out of South Sudan\u2019s war but, like many others, is thinking about loved ones left behind. Leaving her village of Mukaya, she travelled to the town of Yei with her four children. From there it took eight days to walk to the border, pushing her three-year-old on a bicycle while the others followed on foot. \u201cMy husband is a soldier and was forced to stay and fight. I have no hope he will find us here,\u201d she said. \u201cI came only with some cooking utensils. I don\u2019t know what to expect and I have no money to do anything.\u201d The latest arrivals report snipers at the border are now targeting anyone trying to flee. Packed buses arrive every 15 minutes carrying those who have made the crossing safely. Most are women and children but there is a new wave of young men leaving to avoid conscription and considered traitors by those loyal to the regime. Among them is 29-year-old Gideon, whose family was ambushed on their journey by armed men. His eyes brim with tears as he stares down at his red flip flops, dusty but intact after four days of walking. \u201cWe left everything to start a new life here. On the way men came and took all our cows. They were all we had.\u201d Weary families move in orderly lines from one tent to the next, the various stages of bureaucracy. Others stand patiently in queues waiting for a hot meal. Aid workers are diligently catering for the influx but the pressure is mounting. Imvepi opened in December but already 60,000 people have registered with a further 20,000 still to receive their identification cards. Uganda is now home to 1.25 million refugees, including 898,000 South Sudanese who have fled civil war and famine. For years a progressive policy allowing refugees to obtain a plot of land, start businesses and access healthcare and education has proved a godsend for people from Uganda\u2019s unstable neighbours. The compassionate approach, dating back to the 2006 Refugee Act, is not purely altruistic. Entrepreneurial incomers helped the economy while new settlers provided larger markets for existing businesses. Those on both sides of the border tend to be from the same tribe and share a language and relations have been good, with the mutual benefits of improved infrastructure often funded by foreign donors. But now the unprecedented influx from South Sudan, coupled with food shortages, drought and high unemployment, means that hospitality is waning, especially in some areas where refugees now outnumber the indigenous populations. Isabelle D\u2019Haudt, an adviser on humanitarian aid with the European commission, said while integration has proved successful in the past, the cracks are starting to show. \u201cHost communities that have shared their land have benefited from new schools and health centres. But expectations are not always met and we are seeing increasing tensions as refugees and locals compete for services and natural resources.\u201d She added: \u201cThe crisis is a financial one \u2013 the framework is there but we need funding to provide better facilities \u2013 we can\u2019t work miracles without money.\u201d And there are signs that the largely peaceful climate is coming under threat. In the border town of Lamwo, landowners are resisting the relocation of refugees. Politicians have been stoking tensions by inciting locals to demonstrate in the camps or hamper the delivery of aid. Last month armed youths ambushed a convoy in an attempt to stop supplies reaching the settlements. D\u2019Haut said: \u201cIt only happened once but it is a warning of what could come without more money to ease the pressures.\u201d South Sudanese have been fleeing since relations broke down in December 2013 between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar, igniting a civil war. It has forced in excess of 3 million people from their homes, with Uganda shouldering the bulk. At first the numbers were manageable. However, since renewed fighting in Juba in July 2016, almost 627,000 people escaping indiscriminate killings, looting, burning of houses, torture and rape by both government and opposition forces, have crossed the border. The violence has become increasingly sectarian and warnings of impending genocide are fuelling the exodus. Between January and April this year, more than 227,000 South Sudanese arrived in Uganda compared to just over 29,000 during the same period in 2016. Of those, 65% are under 18. Aid workers at Imvepi say the arrivals coming through are increasingly vulnerable. Reka Farkas, a UNHCR field worker, said more people are fleeing due to famine declared in parts of South Sudan in February. \u201cAround a fifth of children are suffering from malnutrition [and] the figure is rising,\u201d she said. Imvepi includes 1,270 temporary shelters designated for vulnerable women and children, many of whom carry the scars of gender-based violence. Back home in Kajo Keji, Lilian Woro, 40, was working on her crops, sweet potatoes and maize, alongside her husband when he was abducted by armed men. She ran with her sister and three children but on their way to the border they were attacked. The mother of three cried as she described how her sister was murdered. \u201cWe were chased by gangs and we ran but she couldn\u2019t get away. They cut her private parts and killed her. After the attack we moved only at night and took to hiding during the day.\u201d Traumatised by the killing and with no news of her husband, Lilian struggles on for her children. \u201cI want them to go to school but at the moment the nearest one is too far for them to walk.\u201d Women and children comprise 85% of Uganda\u2019s total refugee population. Many are at the Bidi Bidi settlement in Yumbe, which opened in August last year and expanded at such a rate it was soon home to more than 272,000 people, becoming the world\u2019s biggest refugee camp. For as far as the eye can see across the semi-arid savannah, mud walled huts with thatched roofs are interspersed with more temporary tarp-covered shelters. Until recently refugees were provided with 100m x 100m plots but this has been reduced to 30m x 30m to cope with demand. In theory each household should have the resources to carry out kitchen gardening on their doorstep but fertile land is scarce. Ariye Floria, 22, arrived at Bidi Bidi from South Sudan three months ago. Gesturing to the scrubland behind her she explains: \u201cI have a small plot here but this place is covered in rocks, there is nowhere to dig. We need help.\u201d Having reached capacity the camp is now closed to newcomers but for the refugees already installed, and those working to accommodate them, the work is only just beginning. Plans include the creation of new schools and health services but without the required funds projects are stalling. The relief budget required to meet the needs of Uganda\u2019s refugee crisis stands at \u00a3744m but aid groups have received only 10% of that sum. The European commission has allocated \u00a338.3m in 2017 to address the emergency but the sheer scale of the crisis means more help is needed from the international community. With the aid operation comes the benefits of jobs for members of the host communities but also problems. In the town of Arua, hotel receptionist Suzanne Elimasia said her company won the tender to carry out construction work at Bidi Bidi, building schools and latrines. The 27-year-old added: \u201cThe refugees are generating jobs for some but not everyone is happy. In Yumbe there is a food shortage and prices have been pushed up. Many locals feel they do not benefit from the work of the NGOs.\u201d Meanwhile environmental pressures are mounting. As more settlements pop up the number of trees being cut down is increasing and locals say they are having to travel further to find firewood. Access to clean water is another contentious issue exacerbated by recent drought. Boreholes have been drilled but the vast majority of water is trucked in from the River Nile. Desperate locals in Yumbe recently blocked access to one borehole for several hours saying they were not benefiting from the influx of refugees. Nearly 200 miles south, refugees at the Kiryandongo settlement say they have been watching as their crops slowly die of thirst. Dishing out a rare meal of beans to her siblings, Eroda Peter says: \u201cWe like Uganda because the soil is fertile and we can eat and dig. But we are suffering from lack of water.\u201d Monica Abau, 37, from Yei, said the food rations used to be distributed more regularly but now come every 10 days. \u201cWhen my children get hungry they go to someone else\u2019s plantation and take what they can find. I\u2019ve had people trap my children and call them thieves.\u201d In the same settlement there has been bloodshed along the same ethnic lines drawn out back in South Sudan. One family said a refugee from the Nuer tribe was murdered at a borehole after a fight over water broke out with a group of Dinkas. The settlement officer, Joel Nabugere, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been enjoying good relations and not had many clashes but recently there have been heightened tensions.\u201d The EU\u2019s ambassador to Uganda, Kristian Schmidt, told reporters at a briefing in Kampala last week that it was only a matter of time before more violence spilled into the refugee settlements. \u201cWhat you see,\u201d he said, \u201cis a civil war which is breaking down along ethnic lines. You can\u2019t just leave those grievances at the border so there are going to be increasing security challenges.\u201d Despite the state of emergency there are no indications that the Ugandan government will consider closing the borders. \u201cUganda is the Germany of east Africa,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cAll the top members of government have been refugees so their inclination is to say these South Sudanese are our brothers. The policy has always been, let them in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
