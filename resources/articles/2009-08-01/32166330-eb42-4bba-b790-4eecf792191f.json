It might be thought such defensive tactics should not be resorted to until, as in 2005, the series reaches its conclusion at The Oval. But this is to misread the precedent. The correct interpretation is that as soon as England take a rare and elusive lead in an Ashes series then you should hit the mat and seek help. Fortunately English cricket-lovers fully understand this and from the moment history was repeated at Lord's after a gap of 75 years they have prayed to their various gods for a deluge. And, boy, have their wishes been granted. The rain that fell on Edgbaston varied between the torrential and the biblical. If it hadn't been for satanic modern technology, Birmingham would have been washed away and England would have arrived at Trent Bridge wearing black armbands and with their precious series lead intact. Job done. This baffles Australians. One of their number, a comedian, appeared on Sky News and castigated the plan outlined in the opening two paragraphs (also known as passive bodyline) for being unnecessarily negative. Hoggardwash. It is, like the great man's batting, not negative but realistic. And what could be more grittily realist than to wish for a hat-trick of abandoneds without a ball being bowleds, which would make Monty Panesar MBE an unlikely hero and ensure that Andrew Flintoff could receive his knighthood without risking further injury? It would also royally piss off the baggy green- wearers to think that laxity in Cardiff cost them the Ashes. Further, being famously impatient as a nation, 15 consecutive days sitting on their arses doing nothing might have been the ruin of their team. In the end, disappointingly, there was cricket. And, as Australia raced to a hundred, in under 20 overs I cannot have been alone in wishing that the covers were back on and we were all enjoying another fascinating passage of passive bodyline. The fault, as ever, lay with the weathermen who in May confidently predicted \"a barbecue summer\", thereby teeing us all up for a glut of passive bodyline, but then last Wednesday ruined everything by downgrading their forecast to above-average rainfall. This was not only feeble (the equivalent of making a prediction after you have seen the result) but verging on the traitorous. The series now has a lot more agonising cricket left in it. Even victory at a sun-kissed Edgbaston would not ease the pain, for a draw would still be required at Trent Bridge or the Oval. Job not at all done. More relaxing by far to don the kagool, put up the plastic umbrella and enjoy Marcus Berkmann's extremely funny Ashes to Ashes \u2013 35 years of humiliation (and about 20 minutes of ecstasy) watching England v Australia. Berkmann is the perfect guide to agonies of watching the Ashes, not least because he has remembered (or possibly recorded) every word uttered by every commentator (his favourite moment being 'Jones! Bowden!' by Richie Benaud [Kasprowicz c Jones b Harmison] which he considers to be superior, just, to Bill Lawry's 'Tufnell! Tufnell! YEAH! TUFNELL!) He also, in his final paragraph, beautifully encapsulates the appeal of the game: \"Fortunately that's the essence of cricket: we can speculate all we like over what might have been, but the narrative is so complex that everything depends on what has happened before, and everything that is yet to happen will depend on what happens now. Great sport, as 2005 was, demands that we live in the present.\" And, selfish perhaps, but my present would be considerably less stressful if it were bucketing down on groundsman Steve Rouse wearing galoshes and looking perplexed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
