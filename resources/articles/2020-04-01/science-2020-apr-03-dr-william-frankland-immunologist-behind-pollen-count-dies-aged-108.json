Frankland improved the lives of millions of hay fever sufferers by developing the idea of a pollen count. Until his death the oldest survivor of the Japanese prisoner of war camps, he published a scientific paper in September 2017 aged 105. Known as \u201cthe grandfather of allergy\u201d, Frankland\u2019s medical career spanned 70 years. He was a British army doctor in the second world war and spent three and a half years as a POW, later crediting his survival to his ability to treat Japanese troops. The historian Dan Snow called Frankland \u201cone of the greatest Britons\u201d, tweeting that he would never forget their meeting. Prof Adam Fox, the president of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology, said Frankland was \u201can enormous inspiration to many\u201d, adding that he would be \u201csorely missed but very fondly remembered\u201d. Frankland, known as Bill, gave an interview to mark his 108th birthday, on 19 March, and put his longevity down to good luck. \u201cI\u2019ve come close to death so many times \u2013 from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, three and a half years spent as a Japanese prisoner of war, to experiencing anaphylaxis following a tropical insect bite,\u201d he said. \u201cBut somehow I\u2019ve always managed to miss it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here.\u201d Frankland was born in Battle, Sussex, in 1912, and studied medicine at the Queen\u2019s College, Oxford and later at St Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical School. When the second world war began he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was captured by the Japanese in 1942. After the war he started work in the allergy department of St Mary\u2019s hospital, and went on to become an assistant to Sir Alexander Fleming in his penicillin research. Among Frankland\u2019s many achievements was his work on desensitisation \u2013 he would regularly experiment on himself using insects supplied by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. His work revealed that hay fever sufferers could be become immune to pollen if exposed to a desensitisation treatment for three years, while many venoms could be neutralised by the same treatment in five. Despite helping millions of allergy sufferers, Frankland said his discoveries had been less about the desire to help than the love of solving problems. \u201cI think being a doctor is rather like being a detective \u2013 someone is sick and there\u2019s something you have to discover that\u2019s not obvious,\u201d he told the Daily Mail in 2005. Frankland talked of his regret in prolonging the life of Saddam Hussein, after advising the Iraqi dictator to give up his 40-a-day smoking habit. \u201cTo my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state,\u201d Frankland said. He retired from his job at St Mary\u2019s at the age of 65 but worked, unpaid, as a consultant at Guy\u2019s hospital for a further 20 years. In his last interview he reflected on the global coronavirus pandemic, saying it was \u201cgreat to see scientists, such as those at Imperial, working so quickly to help tackle the pandemic\u201d, and added he would be having a quiet birthday as the doors of his care home were closed because of the virus. \u201cMy birthday this year will be quite different,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been given a special request to have two of my children visit for a short while, but they will have to keep at a safe distance.\u201d Frankland \u2013 who was made an MBE in 2015 for his services to allergy research \u2013 is survived by two sons and two daughters. His wife Pauline, to whom he was married for 63 years, died in 2002."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
