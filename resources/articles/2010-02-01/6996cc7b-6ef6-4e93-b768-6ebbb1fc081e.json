There is passion and originality in the music of this young Israeli singer and she has a devoted following, striking looks and a sense of humour. But this show didn't match her best recordings, because she was trying too hard to sound emotional and theatrical. Only on the rare occasions when she relaxed did she do justice to the material. She is best known for reviving Ladino songs (the music of Jews expelled from Spain in the late 15th century and dispersed around the Mediterranean), but there's also a strong flamenco influence in her work; she came on looking like a flamenco diva, her black hair matched by a dramatic all-black outfit. Her band matched two acoustic guitars against piano, double bass, Latin-American cajon box percussion and wind instruments ranging from clarinet and Arabic-sounding flute to the wailing Armenian zurna. She started with an old Ladino song, Mi Korason, and then the new flamenco-inspired Nos Llego el Final, both treated in an overdeclamatory style in which almost every phrase was given a sudden burst of power, creating an effect that was jerky rather than passionate. So she continued, through a set that included a fine self-written weepie, Una Noche Mas, a less successful treatment of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, and an emotional sequence in which she sang to a recording by her father, a Ladino expert with a fine, warm voice who died when she was one. There were witty introductions to her increasingly bleak and tragic songs, and she sounded at her best and most relaxed with the bleakest story of all, about a grave-digger forced to bury his own daughter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
