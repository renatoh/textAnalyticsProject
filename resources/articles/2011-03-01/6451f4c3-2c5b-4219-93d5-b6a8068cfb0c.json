The kinds of change he wanted, Gates observed, paralleled those Kennedy sought in 1962 when he told West Point's graduating class, \"Your military responsibilities will require a versatility and an adaptability never before required in war or in peace.\" Gates was right about the premise underlying his and Kennedy's speeches. By 1962, Kennedy had reached the conclusion that second world war-style battles were giving way to an era of unconventional warfare. Nearly a half-century later, Gates found himself updating Kennedy: \"In my opinion, any future defence secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should 'have his head examined', as General MacArthur so delicately put it.\" But as important as the parallels between Kennedy's thinking and Gates's thinking are, the differences are much greater. West Point's grads could take hope from Kennedy's words in a way that is not possible with Gates's. Kennedy was speaking for a prosperous, pre-Vietnam America that, as he insisted in his inaugural address, was prepared to \"pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship\" to maintain world leadership. America's shift to unconventional warfare, Kennedy believed, provided West Point's cadets with \"the greatest opportunity\" for military careers of any generation of academy graduates. By contrast, at the core of Gates's West Point address was his belief that, in today's America, the emphasis on unconventional military warfare will mean a less well-financed, smaller army than in the past: \"The army will be increasingly challenged to justify the number, size and costs of its heavy formations to those in the leadership of the Pentagon, and on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, who ultimately make policy and set budgets.\" Gates worried about a future army in which mid-level officers, after a brief taste of combat, found themselves sitting \"in a cube all day re-formatting power point slides\" and performing \"an ever-expanding array of clerical duties\". To avoid such deadend jobs, Gates advised the cadets in his audience to consider grad school, spend time at a thinktank, even try working for a government agency. The army, in turn, he suggested, ought to act more like a corporation. Army officials should encourage officers \"to apply for job openings in a competitive system more akin to what happens in large organisations in the private sector\". To facilitate the smaller, leaner army he had in mind, Gates told the cadets that he had already done his small part by ordering the \"military to pare down the size and number of its headquarters along with reducing the number of generals and admirals by nearly 100\". More systemic reductions, he went on to say, were still in order. It was essential, Gates declared, to \"transition out\" the bottom 20% of the military before they got too far along in their careers. Like every defence secretary who appears before a West Point audience, Gates was greeted with applause. How cadets, who typically begin their army careers by putting themselves in harm's way and accepting salaries far lower than those paid in the private sector, will take his talk when they have time to consider it is another matter. Behind Gates's speech was the get-tough-on-the-workers philosophy that in recent years, top industry leaders have used to justify downsizing and getting more productivity out of their employees. If the thinking of West Point's graduates of the last two decades is any indicator, Gates's speech is only likely to make a bad situation worse. A recent survey of 250 graduates in six West Point classes covering the years from 1989 to 2004 showed that 93% of those polled believe that half or more of \"the best officers leave the military early rather than serving a full career.\" It is hard to imagine that current academy graduates, faced with the prospect of constant tours in protracted wars, are likely to find Gates's description of the army of the future appealing. The military transformation that John Kennedy pictured in 1962, the year John Glenn orbited the earth three times and made Americans proud of the new space programme, meant greater opportunity for professional advancement in all ranks. Gates is proposing the opposite today \u2013 a military system that instead of rewarding those who have gone from first lieutenant to captain, will do its best to limit future promotions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
