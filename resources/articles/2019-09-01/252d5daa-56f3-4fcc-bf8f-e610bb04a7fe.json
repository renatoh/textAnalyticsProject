Jones\u2019s latest endorsement is for a Japanese gin called Roku, with posters on show here where England begin their World Cup campaign against Tonga on Sunday. Roku is a subsidiary of Suntory, which owns the Sungoliath club that participates in the nation\u2019s professional league. Jones also has a paid consultancy role with the Top League side. Jones\u2019s other commercial interests in Japan, where he is revered after masterminding the Brave Blossoms\u2019 2015 World Cup win against South Africa, include the promotion of man bags made by Japanese company Hunting World. He was seen carrying one of their products as he passed through the arrivals at Miyazaki airport last week despite Canterbury being England\u2019s official kit supplier. Jones was also hired to an advisory role by the Japanese investment bank Nomura in 2017. In addition, Jones has fronted a short film to promote Sapporo called Sapporo Rugby Legends Journeys In Japan, in which he walks through a market and can be seen eating crab and a plate of noodles. Jones is understood to be the highest-paid coach in Test rugby, earning \u00a3750,000 a year including bonus-related pay. Restrictions on England players\u2019 commercial activities during the World Cup are far tighter. It is believed that members of the England elite player squad were limited to three commercial appearances since the start of the summer. Asked about Jones\u2019s commercial interests, a spokesman for the Rugby Football Union said: \u201cWe are aware of this and comfortable with it.\u201d Last year Jones and the RFU had to apologise after footage emerged of the England head coach referring to \u201cthe scummy Irish\u201d and Wales as a \u201clittle shit place\u201d during a talk on leadership for the truck manufacturing company Fuso, the Japanese sister company of the England team sponsor Mitsubishi."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
