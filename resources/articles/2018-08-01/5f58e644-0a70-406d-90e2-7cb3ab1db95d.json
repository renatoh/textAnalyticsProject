Adam Rowe has taken home the accolade after riffing on the challenges of being sacked. \u201cWorking at the jobcentre has to be a tense job,\u201d he pointed out to his audience. \u201cKnowing that if you get fired, you still have to come in the next day.\u201d The gag, from Rowe\u2019s show Undeniable at Just The Tonic at The Caves, topped a public vote after being shortlisted by a panel of comedy critics. It saw off competition from Leo Kearse\u2019s concise \u201cI had a job drilling holes for water \u2013 it was well boring\u201d, and Olaf Falafel\u2019s \u201cI took out a loan to pay for an exorcism. If I don\u2019t pay it back, I\u2019m going to get repossessed.\u201d The top 10 were chosen for the TV channel Dave\u2019s 11th annual awards. Previous winners include Ken Cheng, Masai Graham, Tim Vine, Rob Auton, Stewart Francis, Zoe Lyons and Nick Helm. Rowe, who has been touring Undeniable this year, did his first standup gig in 2010 and quit his bar job a year later after being named Liverpool comedian of the year. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely over the moon and quite blown away by this,\u201d he said of winning the Edinburgh award. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite joke in the show, as it ends the bit I\u2019m most passionate about; trying to dispel a few myths of what it\u2019s like to be brought up on benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge honour, I really never expected to be in with a shout of winning things like this, so it\u2019s just a massive but lovely surprise.\u201d Critics each submitted their six favourite jokes, and the shortlist was voted on by 2,000 people. Luke Hales, a channel director for Dave, said: \u201cThis year the news agenda and everyday British idiosyncrasies have provided some wonderful opportunities for comedians to use their creative and comic genius in giving us all a giggle.\u201d Dave\u2019s top 10 funniest jokes from the 2018 fringe 1) Working at the jobcentre has to be a tense job \u2013 knowing that if you get fired, you still have to come in the next day.
