In the early 1970s, Harry Hyams\u2019 (Obituary, 23 December) Oldham Estates obtained outline planning permission for the commercial development of the Albert Dock and warehouses. The project, under the fanciful name of Aquarius City, required the demolition of the warehouses, to be replaced by office blocks. More damaging was the intention to drain the dock, fill it in and construct a glass-and-steel skyscraper. The permission granted effectively inhibited for quite some time alternative proposals.
