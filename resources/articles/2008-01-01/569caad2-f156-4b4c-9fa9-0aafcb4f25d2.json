Among the worst hit areas were Bristol, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Somerset, where pupils at a village primary school were left marooned after a flooded road cut off access to the building on Friday. Parts of the M5 were closed, causing major delays to drivers, and there were flight cancellations at Bristol International Airport and train diversions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
