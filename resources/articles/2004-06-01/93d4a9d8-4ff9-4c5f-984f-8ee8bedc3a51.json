Well, not yet exactly. No deal as such has been reached at time of press but, if Canon can be the official photocopier of Euro 2004, and McDonald's can sponsor those little children that walk on to the pitch with the players, I see no reason why a semi-humorous column like this should not have a little of the kudos that comes from association with this great festival of football. Clearly money will have to change hands - I think this might be quite an important issue with the Euro 2004 organisers - but, if we can arrange for my people to meet with their people, I am sure an accommodation can be reached. Now all I need is to get myself some people. In the meantime, to show willing, and in recognition of the fact that the Guardian sport tabloid has been woefully deficient in the use of puns around the first syllable of Wayne Rooney's surname, this column plans to redress the balance with a good measure of almost officially sanctioned Euro 2004 Roo puns. The Guardian, eh? Roo do they think they are? So what, you may be asking, is the semi-official line on the pundits? Let us start with Peter Reid. Roo-bish. In one of the late-night talking shops on BBC with Steve Bruce, Mark Lawrenson and Stubbsie - as our semi-official sta tus contractually obliges us to call him - Reidy \"revealed\" that Rooney was \"a very very good player, who will be a great player.\" Quite a roo-velation. Thanks, Peter. This was typical of the BBC highlights team's general stodginess, compared with their ITV counterparts, for whom Danny Murphy has been something of a roo-velation (you've already done that one - ed). Where Murphy, as a team-mate of Gerard and Owen, can offer some sort of insight into what the state of mind might be within the England camp - Gary Neville did a similar job for them at the 2002 World Cup - most of the banter on the BBC team concerns the relative poverty of the club sides managed by Reid and Bruce. \"Bet you'd like to sign him for Coventry/Birmingham,\" Stubbsie will say of some foreign star, to general hilarity all round. I have heard this joke, or variations on it, at least three times. The contest around the live matches is much closer. On the BBC Ian Wright, something of a TV veteran now, is revelling in his role as the butt of Lineker's, Schmeichel's and Hansen's jokes - Ringo to their John, Paul and George. As the more sensible roo-minations (about time - ed) proceed, it is Wrightie's task to be the voice of unreason, and this he does with some \u00e9lan. It is entertaining knockabout stuff and Wrightie obviously knows what he is about. Crazy like a fox. The BBC team's enthusiasm for the Holland-Czech Republic match, with which the tournament finally caught fire, must have matched the mood of the watching millions. When the football is less than captivating, the supposedly animated discussions between the panel members are forced hot-house affairs that fool no one. But, with a match like Saturday's, they grow organically out of the football and are the better for it. The controversy over Roo-ed (geddit?) van Nistelroy's role in Holland's second goal, was enlivened by Gary Lineker's introduction of an official Uefa video clarifying the offside rule, which actually helped very little but did allow Lineker to say of the very stiff and formal commentary, \"Thanks for doing the voice-over on that, Wrightie.\" At ITV, meanwhile, they must still roo Ron Atkinson's open mic spot, which has deprived them of one of the most reliably entertaining pundits. Sir Bobby Robson is no replacement, appearing ponderous and pointless alongside Clive Tyldesley in the commentary box. Gareth Southgate, however, is another find for them on the panel, with a hotline to Steve McClaren and good experience of playing under Sven. \"Win, lose, draw, plague or pestilence,\" said Des Lynam, \"The character of the England manager doesn't change. But what's he really like, Gareth?\" \"Well, I was hoping to play for England again\" was Gareth's speedy and rather smart roo-sponse. More Southgates, Nevilles and Murphies, and the old managers that have been the mainstay of the pundits panels since Cloughie and Allison invented the role in the 70s, might find themselves facing roo-dundancy. Sport on TV this week has not, of course, been all about football but, as Screen Break awaits the call that will confirm its official Euro 2004 validation, Portugal must take centre stage. There is, though, just time to observe, from the BBC's excellent and exhaustive coverage of Royal Ascot, that whoever said cocaine was god's way of telling you that you had too much money was clearly wrong. Hats are. Finally, if I never see another interview with the terminally irritating Frankie Dettori, I will not feel my life to be significantly impoverished. The only thing more irksome than Dettori at Ascot was Dettori on the Question of Sport \"naughty\" out-takes on BBC1 on Saturday night. This flaccid junk amounted to little more than Sue Barker giggling at a succession of single entendres from well-known sporting personalities, and was without doubt the most mirthless half-hour I have spent in front of the television since Winston Churchill's funeral. martin_kelner@yahoo.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
