England are about to play the 27th match, here at Leeds, against Sri Lanka in a tournament that has 45 matches before the semi-finals. Mathematically just about anything is still possible though Afghanistan would have to beat India on Saturday and win the rest of their games to have the slenderest chance of qualifying. Realistically, it is hard to see how any team is going to displace the current top four \u2013 and the semi-finals are still more than a fortnight away. Yet again there will be agonising of what is a brilliant tournament \u2013 once we reach the knockout stages. The format of cricket\u2019s World Cup has changed just about every time, which is incontrovertible evidence that the solution remains elusive. There is always a problem, the greatest of which was early exodus of India in the Caribbean in 2007, which prompted a major overhaul that was triggered by distressed commercial men. There have been calls to enlarge the competition despite the enhanced possibility of mismatches, which have resurfaced after the current struggles of Afghanistan. The format of this tournament is fundamentally fair and will result in the best four teams in those semi\u2011finals, but it is likely to become laborious when another dead match hits the screens at the beginning of July. My current preference \u2013 though this can change like the weather \u2013 is for a 14-team tournament, two groups of seven decided by seedings, a guaranteed passage for the group winners to a semi-final, two \u201cquarter-finals\u201d for the sides who come second and third in their groups. This would slightly reduce the number of games and therefore the duration, something that may be welcomed by all but the money men. Alternatively, perhaps we should adopt The Hundred format, have three matches per day and it will all be over in a week or two? In which case England would be ahead of the game for 2023. Such speculation may prove to be redundant if those in the bottom half of the table at this World Cup suddenly have a resurgence. However, this feels unlikely. It would be astonishing if India were defeated by Afghanistan at Southampton and very, very surprising if Sri Lanka beat England. The solitary concern in the England camp remains the injury to Jason Roy. He will not be available on Friday so James Vince has another chance to deliver a meaningful innings for England. Against Afghanistan his contribution was elegant and painfully exasperating. Yet again he unveiled some silky smooth shots before being dismissed in clumsy fashion, gloving an attempted hook shot. Vince may recognise that he is in the most coveted slot. This has been a tournament for top-order batsmen. The white ball \u2013 sadly \u2013 has declined to swing and generally the pitches have been reliable so there have not been too many hazards at the start of the innings. The major runscorers, Shakib Al Hasan, Joe Root, Aaron Finch, Rohit Sharma and David Warner, all bat in the top three. Nor have the pitches offered much for the spin bowlers. Despite the obstinacy of the white ball to move, the pacemen \u2013 with Mitchell Starc and Mohammad Amir at the top of the list \u2013 have been the prime wicket-takers. Imran Tahir has been the most successful of the spinners with eight victims in five games. Oddly enough Sri Lanka, pursued by rain, which has caused two of their games to be abandoned, have barely used any spin bowlers so far. England are likely to play the same side that played at Old Trafford, in which the pecking order has quietly changed. Jofra Archer (12 wickets in five games) is an automatic choice; so, too, is Mark Wood (nine in four). Liam Plunkett, who has bowled well in his three outings, currently hovers as a reassuring reserve. Meanwhile, Tom Curran has only become a trigger for jokes about Love Island, which I don\u2019t fully understand. Victory for Sri Lanka would transform a campaign in which they have defeated only Afghanistan. They look a shadow of previous World Cup teams. Their openers, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera, are the only batsmen to have shown any form. Their most accomplished player, Angelo Mathews, a tormentor of England in the past, has scored nine runs in three innings. Dinesh Chandimal was not selected. Lasith Malinga tries to recreate former glories at a vastly reduced pace. So expect England to win comfortably, before they tackle the strong sides \u2013 Australia, India and New Zealand \u2013 at the end of this phase. If that is not the case there will be much agonising in their camp; it would also stall what seems like an inevitable procession to the semi-finals. And the tournament would be invigorated for a while."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
