Don't read on if you haven't seen episode five Dan Martin's episode four blog The Longest Day The One Where Herrick returns, but not as we know him; Nina finds out about Mitchell's part in the Box Tunnel Massacre; and the wheels begin to fall off. \"Social services, it's got to be. She looks knackered and she's got terrible hair.\" A change of pace after last week's awesome slayer-fest sees Being Human adopt the position of a closed-set teleplay. Yes, it's the save-the-budget episode, but serving up such a stylish hour of tense psychodrama, you could never call it cheap. Herrick returns not with lip-smacking vengeance but edgy vulnerability, rescued from the psych-ward and taking up residence as the mad vampire in the attic. And as the reality of his return hits home and the question of whether to trust him looms large, the gang's cosy domesticity begins to unravel. Mitchell's still emoting about the \"werewolf-shaped bullet\", but the more immediate worry is the zombified-vampire-shaped bomb that's just been placed under Honolulu Heights. Toby Whithouse has said that in series one the threat was supernatural, in series two the threat was human and in series three the threat comes from within. It's staring to become clear what he was talking about. George has never come to terms with the fact that he once killed somebody. Annie has learned absolutely nothing from her unfortunate history with men and looks like heading to another level of disaster entirely with this new relationship. But it's Mitchell, already fragile from the Box Tunnel 20 and Lia's prophesy, that looks set to be pushed over the edge completely by his old mentor's return. And Nina, finally, is on to him. There was talk on here last week that Mitchell's journey was taking him too far out of the realm of sympathy. Here, his survival instinct kicks in further to the point where by the end you feel more with the taunted, amnesiac Herrick as Mitchell fights to extract the secret of survival. Is this turning into the ruin of a once great character? And speaking of that \u2013 being a mass murder's hardly a great quality in a housemate, but Nina's already aware of who he is and what he's done in the past surely? Should she really be that surprised? Jason Watkins is typically delicious as Herrick of course, playing Hannibal Lecter to Annie's Clarice Starling. You believe the amnesia's real, but the psycho still lurks beneath: \"you're a bit peripheral, like a regimental mascot.\" Ace. Meanwhile, another week and another uncommonly brilliant guest turn in the shape of Nicola Walker's harassed, insomniac, Red Bull-swigging social worker Wendy. We're not going to be able to watch Spooks with the same eyes again, frankly. Supernature We're going to need to get to the bottom of quite how Daisy and Cara's bloodletting rejuvenation of Herrick worked sooner or later. The only revelation this week is that staked vampires smell like cigarettes. Poor Cara. Pop Culture Notes Aside from Wendy's \"Tena Lady moment\" there's not much zeitgeist surfing to be done here, which actually serves to heighten the timeless Pinteresque intensity of the piece (yes, the word \"piece\" actually feels suitable this week). But nice use of Dirge by Death In Vegas at the end. There's no creeping sense of violent dread that Dot Allison's incredible voice cannot soothe. Mysteries Do we believe Herrick's amnesia is real? What's his game? It can hardly be a co-incidence, so how did he end up in a psychiatric unit in Barry? Who does that hideous Hawaiian shirt belong to? Is Nina really the werewolf-shaped bullet? And was it just us, or was there something significant about that lingering shot of the rotting bowl of fruit?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
