Question 1 concerned a striker throwing a punch at the home keeper just as a home forward breaks through at the other end. The answer should have been: \u201cThis is an act of violent conduct and you need to deal with it decisively. First, play advantage \u2013 if the home forward scores, award the goal, then send off the away striker who threw the punch. If not, stop the game, send off the striker and restart with a direct free kick to the home team from where the punch was thrown.\u201d An editing error in a caption to a large photograph of Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire, led it to state: \u201cIn other rewilded areas, lynx and grey wolves have been successfully reintroduced.\u201d Not yet. As the story made clear: \u201cApplications are being submitted this month \u2026 for a five-year trial to release around 18 lynxes.\u201d No agreements exist on wolves. (\u201cMake way for the lynx and the bear\u201d, In Focus, last week, page 25). While the Holland Festival was early in recognising the talent of composer Benjamin Britten, it did not stage his War Requiem in the late 1940s. It was not written until 1961.
