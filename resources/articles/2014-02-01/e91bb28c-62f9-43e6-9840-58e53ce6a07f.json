So Barack Obama's refusal to choose between Britain and France (\"it would be like choosing between my two daughters,\" the Prez teased) when he faced the White House media with the lovelorn Hollande was a soothing irritant. Paris knows how neurotic London's patriotic tabloids are about being No 1 Chum. But the revenge is mild compared with S\u00e9go Royal's comment on hearing what Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, her own rival for the portly Hollande's affections, said on being dumped. It was \"like falling from a skyscraper\", Val told friends. \"No need to exaggerate \u2013 it was hardly 9/11,\" purred S\u00e9go. Miaow! \u2022 Timing matters. So it was not the best week for Ofwat, the water regulator, to seek an urgent cash advance of \u00a31.5m to \"help meet peak demand\". More rain fell in Britain this last month than in any January for 250 years. And it ain't over yet. \u2022 Michael Gove has challenged X Factor's tiresome Simon Cowell to educate his son at a British state school after the numbskull impresario told kids not to get educated but to \"get lucky\", instead. Not unreasonably, Peter Pan Cowell (54) protests that his sort-of girlfriend has not actually had the tot yet. It's never too early to get a child's name down for Bog Standard Academy, Simon. But will it still be open in 2025? \u2022 No namby-pamby nudge theory from Hong Kong martial arts star Jackie Chan (59). Today's London conference on the trade in endangered species heard that African states are complicit in the illegal sale of ivory and horn, but that China is the biggest \"insatiable\" market for it. Chinese people who buy this stuff for health reasons should be told they'll get cancer and die, animal-loving Chan tells the fans. \u2022 More successes for the intrepid TaxPayers' Alliance, whose research even boosters like the Tory blogmeister Tim Montgomery admits is \"often highly populist and sometimes unrealistic\". Fallen immigration minister Mark Harper is said to have paid his illegal cleaner a modest \u00a37.50 an hour, which saves the taxpayer lots. And gay couples seeking to change their civil partnership plans into a Dave-blessed proper marriage are being told by some cash-strapped registry offices (Lewisham's, for instance) that they must pay the \u00a380 fee again. Another triumph for cost-conscious housekeeping. Well done, TaxPayers' Alliance! \u2022 Rare good news for TaxPayers' Alliance types from the spendthrift MoD, whose procurement contracts sustain some of Britain's most profligate welfare queens. With joke-free entrepreneur Philip Hammond in charge the kit budget is under control at last, despite a further \u00a3754m increase in the cost of those pesky new aircraft carriers with no aircraft. Auditors have spotted an extra \u00a365m needed to buy paint (and scaffolding for painters) beyond original plans. That's a lot of grey paint, unless it comes from Osborne &amp; Little, the chancellor's fashionable family firm, where it would just about decorate an oligarch's loo. \u2022 No-nonsense Germaine Greer, the thinking PhD's Edna Everage, would have sorted out wimpish Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's m\u00e9nage. Promoting White Beech \u2013 her book about saving the rainforest \u2013 in her adopted hometown of Saffron Walden, she told adoring fans about the downside of feminism. \"People think that because I'm a feminist they can't give me flowers, so I always get fruit. In hotel rooms I have to ask them to send some flowers up. Flowers are bisexual, for God's sake, fruit is just ovaries,\" declared the old trouper (75). Asked about women in sport, Greer wondered why there are so few female racing drivers. \"Is it because they can't park?\" \u2022 Today saw the acquittal of Dave Lee Travis of sordid sex crimes (the embattled CPS's third such celeb defeat in recent months). Could it be that non-celeb private school staff are easier to put before juries? Twitter: @MichaelWhite"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
