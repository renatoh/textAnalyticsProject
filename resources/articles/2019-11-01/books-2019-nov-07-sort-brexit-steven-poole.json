Sadly for many Labour voters, though, he didn\u2019t mean he would carefully \u201csort\u201d Brexit into a fire-pit of things destined for oblivion. The verb \u201cto sort\u201d comes from the Latin sort\u012br\u012b, to distribute by lottery, which is why \u201csortition\u201d is the name for a system of democratic government, arguably superior to the one we currently enjoy, where leaders are made up of randomly chosen citizens. But Corbyn used the demotic sense of \u201csort\u201d to mean \u201csort out\u201d, to solve or clear up, as in the exclamation \u201cSorted!\u201d. Commuters on London\u2019s public transport have long been irritated by its \u201cSee It. Say It. Sorted\u201d slogan, though even \u201cto sort out\u201d \u2013 in the sense of to resolve rather than literally to divide \u2013 is relatively newfangled, recorded only since 1948. Yet the sense of \u201cto sort\u201d as to accomplish is of much more antique vintage. As the Third Citizen in Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III remarks: \u201cAll may be well: but if God sort it so / Tis more then we deserve or I expect.\u201d So might we feel about the election. \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
