The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Donna Summer: I Feel Love Although I'm thinking if you've got the mood of the dancefloor so wrong that it needs rescuing, then maybe your dancefloor rescue song might be wrong, too. No wonder I get a bit anxious when I DJ. The track that currently gets the most rewinds Anna Karina: Roller Girl It's one of those where the girls turn into Brigitte Bardot and the guys get all Serge Gainsbourg. Once it's ended, you definitely want to hear it again. The track I wish I'd signed to my label Rangers: Zeke's Dream It's an opus. Beautiful crunched-up synths and waves of joy. The track I'd play at my auntie's wedding The Names: Calcutta She loves that song. There'd be a lot of northern soul played, too. The best track by my favourite new artist Blood Music: Sea Of Leaves I'm a bit biased as I was there when they recorded it, but the result is breathtaking. The track I'd play to show off my eclectic tastes Lambchop: Up With People It's not classic dancefloor fodder but it's got a kind of finger-snapping groove and you can sing along with the trumpets. You wouldn't get David Guetta dropping this. The track that got me out of bed this morning The Vaccines: Why Should I Love You It's a cover of an R Stevie Moore song. It has a bit of a Box Tops feel to it, like the purest kind of pop. It put me in a bright and breezy mood that's still going eight hours later. The track that should have been a crossover hit Jean-Claude Vannier: L'Ours Paresseux I've been listening to lots of French music recently and was knocked out when I first heard Vannier. He played a gig a while back with Jarvis Cocker and Super Furry Animals; we should all get together and get him his well-deserved crossover hit. The track I want played at my funeral Arthur Russell: I Couldn't Say It To Your Face The opening line is \"I couldn't say it to your face/ But I won't be around any more\". That ought to get people teary. If not, I'd want to know what they were doing at my funeral.
