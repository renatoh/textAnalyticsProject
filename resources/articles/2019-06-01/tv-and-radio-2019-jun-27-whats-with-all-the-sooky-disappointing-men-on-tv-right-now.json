She\u2019s cheering wildly. A decade ago, this type of romantic setup would have contained all the chemistry of a bloated ShamWow. But this is 2019, and here the disappointing, underachieving male is not simply in a supporting role on TV, he\u2019s a proper romantic lead. Sure, Marcus reminds Sasha of home and the things she left behind, but it\u2019s hard not to watch the film and think \u2013 really? The high-achieving go-getter prefers this guy to Keanu Reeves? It\u2019s no secret that male characters have been going through something of a shift recently. We\u2019ve already witnessed the Hot But Horrible trend come back into force via the priest in Fleabag, a show utterly bereft of decent male characters. Earlier this year Vulture examined what it called the \u201csoft boys of Netflix\u201d, while The Hollywood Reporter ran a story last March on \u201cThe Triumph of the Beta Male\u201d, featuring the openly nerdy stars of TV\u2019s Silicon Valley on the magazine\u2019s widely panned cover. Without bemoaning the disintegration of a terribly two-dimensional idea of strong masculinity, the new wave of tough, independent female characters does seem to be increasingly paired off with love interests who simply don\u2019t measure up. Consider Sandra Oh\u2019s moustachioed husband in Killing Eve, who dresses almost exclusively in lounge wear and has passive-aggressive tantrums about his wife leaving home to hunt assassins. Or Jeremy, Audrey\u2019s husband in The Letdown, who, when he saw his own baby crying, had the temerity to ask, \u201cDo I pick her up?\u201d Then there\u2019s Aidy Bryant\u2019s love interest in Shrill, Ryan, who asks her to please exit from the back of the house so his friends don\u2019t see who he just slept with. The gesture is more likely to save her reputation than his, considering he\u2019s basically a bed-dwelling Hobbit with the refined charm of a leaf blower. The disappointing male partner is also in full bloom on Netflix. In Dead To Me, Judy\u2019s husband, Steve (James Marsden), is so used to gliding through life using only the power of his cheekbones, he seems blind to the needs of everyone around him. And then there\u2019s Dean (Matthew Lillard), Christina Hendricks\u2019 husband in Good Girls, whose greatest betrayal is not his adultery (though that\u2019s also obviously not great) but his incompetence: as a businessman, an investor and, most crushing of all, as a dad. Perhaps the trend is in part a backlash to the dark and brooding antihero who dominated our TV screens in the early 2000s \u2013 Tony Soprano, Don Draper, Walter White, Omar Little. Flawed men who emoted dangerous, sometimes sexualised power with a squint, and a flare of the nostrils. If they sneezed, their female counterparts caught pneumonia. But somewhere along the line, perhaps as more women took up space in writer\u2019s rooms, the alpha male lead began to fade from view. As a consequence, it\u2019s becoming clear just how dissatisfying the unbalanced power dynamic actually is. Part of it is a function of the writing \u2013 drama comes from conflict, and a story about a woman wielding power doesn\u2019t work as well with a supportive husband; where\u2019s the conflict then? Still. Why can\u2019t we have stories in which two equals battle it out and find meaningful compromise? What about a world in which neither partner has to sacrifice themselves or the things that are important to them? Especially when we\u2019re talking about romcoms, which are essentially wish-fulfilment fantasies \u2013 wouldn\u2019t that be a more progressive kind of wish-fulfilment than settling for the lazy and uninspiring? But perhaps in 2019, women\u2019s wish-fulfilment is only partly focused on romance. The romcom has, for a while now, been as much about the ideal job, outfit and home as it is the ideal partner. Sex and the City, The Devil Wears Prada and Something\u2019s Gotta Give are about aspirational lifestyles. Perhaps it is that right now, a woman\u2019s greatest wish is her own success, and the man figures less in that equation, because he\u2019s no longer seen as the central measure of it. Or perhaps, just for this moment, female wish-fulfilment is centred on dominance. It\u2019s not progressive, it\u2019s not ideal, but as women get in touch with their general disappointment over men, perhaps it is \u2013 for this short time in history \u2013 an accurate reflection of what women want."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
