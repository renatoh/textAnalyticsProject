Austerity and the gig economy has given Loach new material. He follows I, Daniel Blake with this agonising study of a delivery driver (played by Kris Hitchen) whose life descends into a vicious circle of self-destruction as he struggles to make ends meet. Doctor Sleep (15) (Mike Flanagan, 2019, US) 152 mins Ewan McGregor stars in this film adapted from Stephen King\u2019s follow-up novel to The Shining. McGregor is Danny Torrance, the son of Jack Nicholson\u2019s Jack Torrance (who freezes to death in the Kubrick film). Torrance Jr, of course, has psychic powers (\u201cthe shining\u201d) and has to see off a cult, the True Knot led by Rebecca Ferguson, who feed on kids with these abilities. Brittany Runs a Marathon (15) (Paul Downs Colaizzo, 2019, US) 104 mins Jillian Bell makes a bid to become the new Melissa McCarthy with her breakout performance in this indie comedy that made a splash at Sundance, before being picked up by Amazon. Bell plays a hedonistic party girl who decides to get in shape for the New York marathon; as she gets fitter physically her life changes in ways she is not entirely happy with. Monos (15) (Alejandro Landes, 2019, Col/Arg/Neth/Ger et al) 102 mins Gruelling drama of teen soldiers on a mission in the Colombian jungle, part of a nameless faction in an unidentified civil war. Guarding an American prisoner, and kept in line by \u201cthe Messenger\u201d, the group disintegrates in Conrad-meets-Lord of the Flies style: brawling, sleeping with each other, and generally coming undone at the seams. Terminator: Dark Fate (15) (Tim Miller, 2019, US) 128 mins There is a lot riding on this: can the return of James Cameron (as a producer), Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger spark a revival in the underperforming man v machine franchise? Tim Miller, director of the smartmouth superhero flick Deadpool, has been installed in the director\u2019s chair \u2013 to not a whole lot of effect, it has to be said. With Natalia Reyes as the girl menaced by terminators from the future, and Mackenzie Davis as the fighter helping her, this attempt at a greatest-hits rerun never really hits the heights. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock &amp; pop Anna of the North Norway\u2019s Anna Lotterud, AKA Anna of the North, makes the kind of soothing, tactile electropop that Scandinavia still excels at. Since her 2017 debut, the slowburn Lovers, she has flexed her creative muscles, collaborating with the likes of Tyler, the Creator and Rejjie Snow, while also finding time to record her second album of pillow-soft pop, Dream Girl. Heaven, WC2, Wednesday 6 November Burna Boy Earlier this year, Nigerian Afro-fusion pioneer Burna Boy was so enraged by what he perceived to be a lowly placement on the lineup for Coachella he vented his fury on social media, referring to himself as an African Giant. That title now adorns his new album, his first to break the UK Top 20. He will be keen to prove himself further at these UK dates. London, Sunday 3; Manchester, Wednesday 6; touring to 10 November Deerhunter Bradford Cox and his band of merry-ish men head out on tour in support of their eighth album, Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared?, a rejection of nostalgia in the face of very grim reality. While musically it continues their pop phase (relatively speaking), Cox\u2019s lyrics are as bleak as ever. Dublin, Saturday 2; Roundhouse, NW1, Sunday 3; Brighton, Monday 4; Bristol, Tuesday 4; Manchester, Wednesday 6; Digbeth, Thursday 7 November Lizzo The breakout star of 2019 \u2013 even if her recent US No 1, Truth Hurts, was first released in 2017, and her new single, Good as Hell, made a small dent in 2016 \u2013 Lizzo arrives in the UK following a summer of festival-owning sets. Expect self-help mantras, sweat-tickling choreography and lashings of personality. O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Wednesday 6 &amp; Thursday 7; O2 Academy Glasgow, Friday 8; touring to 11 November MC Snarky Puppy Popular New York jazz-funk collective Snarky Puppy will always groove your socks off, but on their new album, Immigrance, they temper their discordant instincts with catchy hooks and climactic jamming, as deceptively slow-burning arrangements radiate their own eloquent glow. Bournemouth, Wednesday 6; Nottingham, Thursday 7; Bristol, Friday 8 November JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Hans Abrahamsen The Royal Academy has founded an annual residency in memory of Oliver Knussen, and the first composer to take on that role is the Dane Hans Abrahamsen, championed by Knussen as a conductor. Abrahamsen\u2019s tenure begins with three days of events, comprising a Q&amp;A with the composer (Wed) and a pair of concerts: a lunchtime programme including two chamber works for wind instruments, and a performance with the Academy Manson Ensemble conducted by Ryan Wigglesworth featuring ensemble works Winternacht, M\u00e4rchenbilder and Wald. Royal Academy of Music, NW1, Wednesday 6 to Friday 8 November Sound and Fury The Scottish Chamber Orchestra has a new composer-in-association, the British-born, US-resident Anna Clyne. Her three-year term is launched with a world premiere, Sound and Fury, inspired by the source of the title, Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, and by Haydn\u2019s 60th Symphony, nicknamed \u201cIl Distratto\u201d. The Queen\u2019s Hall, Edinburgh, Thursday 7; City Halls, Glasgow, Friday 8 November Philip Grange The BBC Philharmonic certainly does its bit for composers from the north of England. Its latest commission is a violin concerto from Grange (professor of music at Manchester University), whose dark-hued music is always distinctive. The premiere of the concerto forms the centrepiece of the BBC Phil\u2019s concert under Ben Gernon. The Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Saturday 2 November AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Hayley Newman In our time of meaningless rhetoric, insults that poison cyberspace and endless antagonistic debate, Newman\u2019s exhibition Tongue-tied explores the absurdities of speech and the attractions of silence. Newman is best known as a performance artist but here shows drawings, watercolours and other works that speak for this dumb age. Matt\u2019s Gallery, SE16, Saturday 9 to 24 November Patrick Staff What would life be like on Venus, an intensely hot planet with no oxygen? That is one of the perspective-shifting questions asked in this futuristic installation, which turns a former gunpowder store into a biomorphic system of tubes and vents. Engravings and video haunt this uncanny architecture exploring queer and transgender identity. Serpentine Sackler Gallery, W2, Friday 8 November to 9 February C\u00e9zanne A bequest from the late art dealer Karsten Schubert has given the Whitworth a superb collection of works on paper by the isolated, self-questioning genius who inspired Picasso and Braque to invent Cubism. C\u00e9zanne is the godfather of all truly modern art. This small but intense exhibition reveals how he took visible appearances apart until the theme of his nudes and mountains becomes perception itself. The Whitworth, Manchester, to 1 March Buddhism Buddhist art has a 2,600-year history and ranges from expressive faces and sublime figures to such abstract monuments as stupa domes. A key phase in its development took place in ancient Afghanistan where classical Greek influences met Asian philosophy to shape a graceful, eloquent concept of art. This show looks at the global history of Buddhism and its images, with special emphasis on manuscripts in the Library\u2019s collection. British Library, NW1, to 23 February Birth Tracey Emin\u2019s drawings of birth are dark expressionist nightmares. She contributes to this show along with Paula Rego, Boo Saville, Madeline Donahue and many more. Male artists often tend to pass over birth itself, preferring to paint smiling Madonnas looking after chubby babies to depicting the physical experience of bringing a child into the world. That gets ample correction here. Last chance to see. TJ Boulting Gallery, W1, to 9 November JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows Death of a Salesman Angels in America director Marianne Elliott continues her purple streak of hit theatre shows with a stunning remake of Arthur Miller\u2019s iconic play, co-directed with Miranda Cromwell, starring Wendell Pierce (The Wire, Treme) as Willy Loman and Sharon D Clarke (Caroline, Or Change) as his wife. The cast is uniformly brilliant but it is Clarke\u2019s final lines, and broken singing, that will really move you. Piccadilly Theatre, W1, to 4 January Mary Poppins A spoonful of sugar in these troubled times, Mary Poppins swoops back into the West End following a UK tour. The book is written by Julian \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d Fellowes and this is directed by Richard Eyre, with choreography from Matthew Bourne. Zizi Strallen will play Mary, and Petula Clarke, at the tender age of 86, will be feeding the birds. Prince Edward Theatre, W1, to 3 May Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran This Fringe First-winning show lands in Manchester. Co-created by Javaad Alipoor and Kirsty Housley, it follows Alipoor\u2019s hit show The Believers Are But Brothers, offering a high-energy ride through the champagne-soaked, social-media-obsessed lives of the Iranian elite. The production is a little rough around the edges but there\u2019s something in its chaotic thrust that feels horribly pertinent. HOME, Manchester, Saturday 2 November Deep Night, Dark Night The candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse \u2013 a stunning, almost spiritual venue \u2013 will host a series of spooky tales for Halloween and beyond. Taking Shakespeare\u2019s work as inspiration, writers including Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, Sami Ibrahim and Diana Evans will delve into London\u2019s dark past. The shows will be separated into two different bills, and the first programme is guaranteed to feature a story from (yes!) Jeanette Winterson. Suitable for ages 12 and upwards. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 5 December Ghost Quartet Soho\u2019s brand new Boulevard Theatre has a revolving stage and, more surprisingly, revolving balconies. The venue\u2019s first show is a musical about love, loss and spectres from Dave Malloy, writer of Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812. The director is Bill Buckhurst, who was behind the small-scale production of Sweeney Todd, which started out in a London pie shop and wound up in New York. Boulevard Theatre, W1, to 4 January MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Lady Magma: The Birth of a Cult Probably the most exciting young choreographer in UK dance right now, Belfast-based Oona Doherty\u2019s acclaimed works Hope Hunt and Hard to Be Soft focused on the foibles of the working-class male. Her latest, Lady Magma, turns its attention to women, in a 70s-infused paean to wild femininity and ecstatic Dionysian ritual. The MAC, Belfast, Saturday 2 November Acosta Danza Carlos Acosta\u2019s Havana-based company returns to the UK in Christopher Bruce\u2019s Rooster, set to music by the Rolling Stones. New works by Swedish choreographer Pontus Lidberg and upcoming Cuban Ra\u00fal Reinoso, plus Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui\u2019s seductive Faun, complete the programme. Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, Saturday 2 November Igor &amp; Moreno: Beat This duo first grabbed our attention with a delightfully minimal duet, Idiot-Syncrasy, featuring the two dancers jumping up and down on the spot. Beat has a similarly stark proposition: one DJ, one dancer and a metaphor about the optimism and disappointment of the millennial generation.
