Here, mixed in with more familiar material, you will find such outbursts of exasperated affection as Down Boy, An Occasional Man and The Gentleman Is a Dope. Together with tenor saxophonist Harry Allen's quartet (including that immaculate pianist Rossano Sportiello), Kilgore brings them all swinging back to life. Well over an hour of subtle perfection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
