In an interview with Channel 4 News on Friday, Greg Miskiw said Beckham\u2019s voicemails were accessed \u201croutinely, all the time, over and over again\u201d. Miskiw also spoke of his regret at the hacking of murdered 13-year-old schoolgirl Milly Dowler\u2019s phone and described the culture at the now-defunct newspaper \u2013 saying that failure to \u201cget the story\u201d would soon be followed by the sack. And he said that hacking had gone on at other newspapers, which had thus far not been brought to light. He made similar revelations in an exclusive essay with the Byline Project. \u201cWe hacked David Beckham\u2019s phones routinely, all the time, over and over again,\u201d Miskiw said. But he added that one of the paper\u2019s most high profile stories \u2013 when it claimed that Beckham had had an affair with his assistant, Rebecca Loos, a claim he has always denied \u2013 had not come from hacking Beckham\u2019s phone. \u201cThe [Rebecca Loos] story, we had to track all these phones. From recollection, I don\u2019t think we got anything of any significance from doing Beckham\u2019s phones [for it],\u201d he said. Beckham has long believed that he was a victim of phone hacking and, in 2013, News Corporation, which owned the News of the World, settled a case with the former footballer\u2019s father out of court. But no one connected to the company had hitherto publicly admitted that Beckham\u2019s phones were hacked. Miskiw, nicknamed the \u201cprince of darkness\u201d because of his connection to the so-called dark arts, said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d when he heard that his colleagues had hacked Milly Dowler\u2019s phone. \u201cI was in Florida at the time and I lay down on my bed and stared at the fan for a couple of hours thinking: \u2018How awful.\u2019 It was like a scene out of a movie. I was just absolutely devastated.\u201d Asked what he would say to Milly\u2019s father, he said: \u201cWhat could I say other than that I am terribly sorry it happened? It was more than a misjudgment, it was an appalling thing to do.\u201d But Miskiw insisted that he was not responsible for the closure of the News of the World, which was shut down by management in 2011. The paper, he said, had \u201cbrought itself down. Or News International [News Corporation\u2019s former UK arm, now called News UK] brought itself down by reacting the way they did.\u201d He added: \u201cIf they had decided from day one to grasp the nettle and say \u2018Right, there is a handful of journalists who are doing this, we are going to get rid of them,\u2019 the News of the World would still be running now.\u201d Miskiw was a news editor at the paper, an influential job that required him to coordinate its news coverage and to be responsible for its news reporters. He was also responsible for bringing the convicted phone hacker Glenn Mulcaire to the paper. \u201cYou were in a bubble at the News of the World, where the objective was very simple: just get the story. Just get it. No matter what, no matter how. That is what was expected of you. \u201cAnd, if you did not and you did not do it once, or twice, or three times, and you failed, you would be out of the door,\u201d he said. Along with the paper\u2019s former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, Miskiw was jailed for six months in July 2014 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages. The pair served 37 days each in total. Spokespeople for News UK and Beckham declined to comment on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
