He continued: \"To have been entrusted with the honour on this prestigious occasion, after grafting for 23 years, suddenly makes all the pain and sacrifice worthwhile.\" The game between Manchester United and Chelsea on Saturday will be the pinnacle of the 46-year-old Kent official's career, which started back in 1984. He has twice officiated at a Cup final - as a linesman in 1995 and the fourth official six years later - and to make it a hat-trick is an impressive achievement, especially as a referee can only take charge on one occasion. \"This particular occasion [the final on Saturday] would test the calmest and most focused referee. That's it - my thoughts as I felt them at the time. There's a huge satisfaction and it really is incredibly special,\" he said. His meticulousness and strict following of the rules have endeared him to some - and infuriated others. In February, Neil Warnock accused Bennett of being a \"manufactured\" and \"by-the-book referee, black and white\" after awarding Liverpool two penalties during Sheffield United's 4-0 defeat at Anfield. \"If Steve Bennett knew a bit more about the game and not the rules inside out, he'd be a really top referee,\" Warnock said. Bennett, however, has said that he \"does not lose any sleep over criticism\" because he \"believes in his own ability\". He has been a Premier League referee since 1999 and he became an international referee two years later. And even though he never played the game at the highest level - or, indeed, nowhere near the highest level - he still believes he collected enough experience as a goalkeeper in the Orpington and Bromley Sunday League. \"I suffered a few busted fingers when I kept goal,\" he said. \"To say that we've never played is something that can be easily laid against a referee but we've all played at some level, even if it's not the highest.\" Bennett also believes there is less opportunity for referees these days to be liberal with the laws - even if they feel it helps their rapport with players. \"The way the game has gone there is less room for what's called the commonsense approach because there are mandatory instructions we have to follow,\" he said. \"While we don't always like it, there is no option. The danger of using 'commonsense' is that you can open yourself up to being called inconsistent.\" \"We have an understanding of what goes on and yet it's an easy thing to level against us when things don't go a team's way. As referees, we understand these comments and know that they are said more out of frustration than meant personally. If you allowed criticism to affect you, you wouldn't carry on. You have to grow an extra layer of skin.\" And not even the possibility of incurring the wrath of Sir Alex Ferguson or Jose Mourinho on Saturday has dampened the official's excitement for the game between what he describes as \"two fantastic teams\". \"While I have to be extremely focused, when you see someone sprint down the line, play a dummy and score a great goal then it's a joy,\" he said. \"Even the referee gets that sense of 'wow', the feeling that it's a pleasure to be there. \"Football is a great game and everyone wants to be involved in it for different reasons. We're all in it because we love it. If you're not good enough to play at a certain level then maybe the next best thing is to officiate. Referees live for each Saturday just as players do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
