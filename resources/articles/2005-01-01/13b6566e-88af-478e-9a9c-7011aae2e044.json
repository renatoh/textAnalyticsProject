Although some resorts are off limits, they say others nearby remain open for business and will suffer if tourists don't come. 'People are feeling guilty and uncomfortable going to lie on the beach in front of people who have gone through such difficult times, but the reality is that these people want and need tourists to come,' said a Thomson spokesman. He said despite reassurances that resorts met health and safety standards, some customers were choosing to switch to other destinations, such as the Caribbean and Red Sea. In Thailand, Thomson has cancelled packages to Krabi and the islands of Phuket, Koh Phi Phi and Khao Lak until at least 31 January and is encouraging customers to switch to other parts of Thailand that were unaffected, such as Pattaya, Hua Hin and Koh Samui. Kuoni and Trailfinders are redirecting people due to travel in January to other parts of the country such as Bangkok, Chiang Mai and the Gulf of Thailand. Those due to travel in February may also be moved. 'We won't send people if the infrastructure isn't up to scratch, including local bars and restaurants, as well as roads and supply chains. These may take longer than hotels to reopen, but the resorts rely on different businesses supporting each other,' said a spokesman from Trailfinders. In the Maldives, Kuoni, Thomas Cook Signature, Tropical Breeze and My Travel are offering refunds or alternative trips for those due to travel in January. The tour operators said around half of their customers were choosing to postpone or rebook their holiday in other destinations such as the Caribbean or East Africa. The majority of Maldives resorts used by Thomson remain open for business but still customers are reluctant to go. 'It's very hard to explain the situation to people over the telephone, particularly with the Maldives. It's so vast that the islands in the North Atoll were totally unaffected,' said a spokesman. Some specialist operators reported a more positive reaction from their customers. A spokesman from Cox and Kings said none of its clients had cancelled trips to the Maldives in January, though they may have been redirected to different hotels. Cox and Kings said most customers due to visit Sri Lanka before 31 January were refusing refunds and alternatives and going ahead with their travel plans. 'The majority wanted to travel inland anyway so are still going to do so. They will just avoid the south.' Young independent travellers still want to go to Thailand, said a spokeswoman from STA Travel. 'They want to help by spending money to help the local economy all over Thailand. The majority are still going to Koh Phangan and Koh Samui, even if they can't go to the affected areas.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
