But Jerad and Amanda Miller, the two alleged shooters, were actually vocal fans of InfoWars.com, and, more than that, as first revealed by Mother Jones, Jerad had as early as 2012 posted on the site about killing police officers. Miller\u2019s post, which is from May in that year, is titled 'The Police (To Kill Or Not To Kill)'. Miller discusses, at length, encounters he\u2019d had with police officers, as well as the unfairness of being on probation. In the post, Miller said one particular experience made him feel like he had taken \u201ca trip back in time to Nazi Germany\u201d. \u201cI do not wish to kill police,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI understand that most of them believe they are doing the right thing.\u201d But, he explained in the post, he felt he had little choice. \u201cI\u2019m being pushed further and further into a corner,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI am like a wild coyote. You corner me, I will fight to the death.\u201d The post concluded: \u201cSo, do I kill cops and make a stand when they come to get me? I would prefer to die than sit in their jail.\u201d In the comments underneath the post, his then fiancee Amanda wrote: \u201cJerad, baby, I love you with all my heart and I\u2019ll stand behind you no matter what. It\u2019s true that it's not fair that I can\u2019t have a gun because you live with me.\u201d At the time, the couple were living in Indiana, where a previous drug charge against Jerad prevented them from purchasing firearms. Jerad and Amanda Miller also frequently posted links to InfoWars to their Facebook pages. They appear to have been believers in a wide range of conspiracy theories and anti-government beliefs, including some championed by Jones. During his radio broadcast on Monday morning, Jones said that there was \u201cso much proof\u201d that the shooting was staged by the government that when he read about the event, his mind \u201cexploded with hundreds of data points\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
