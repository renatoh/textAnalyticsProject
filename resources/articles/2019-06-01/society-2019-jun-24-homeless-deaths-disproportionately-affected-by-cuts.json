Nine of the 10 councils with the highest numbers of homeless deaths in England and Wales between 2013 and 2017 have had cuts of more than three times the national average of \u00a3254 for every household. They are Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Blackburn, Liverpool and the four London boroughs of Camden, Westminster, Lambeth and Tower Hamlets. It follows rising disquiet about the growing number of deaths of rough sleepers across the UK, including the death of a man near parliament in February. Birmingham, the seventh most deprived council in England and Wales, has seen the highest number of homeless deaths with 90 people estimated to have died between 2013 and 2017. The city\u2019s council has experienced a cut in spending power per household of more than \u00a3939 for every home since 2010, according to Labour. Camden in north London has the second worst figures, with 89 deaths among rough sleepers and those living in hostels during the same period. During the last decade, every household in the borough has experienced cuts of \u00a3980. Official rough sleeping counts in Manchester have risen from seven people in 2010 to 123 in 2018 and, in common with many other cities, it has become highly visible, with numerous people bedding down in city centre doorways. During the four years examined by Labour, 65 homeless people were recorded to have died in the city during a period in which the city council experienced cuts of \u00a3926 for each household. Blackburn is the only town included in Labour\u2019s list and has the 10th highest number of deaths in a four-year period. The Lancashire town has had an estimated 41 deaths among homeless people up to 2017, while spending power for every household has been cut by \u00a3879, according to Labour. James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, last year announced a one-off \u00a330m funding pot for immediate support for councils to tackle rough sleeping. Birmingham received \u00a3405,000 from the government for immediate homelessness support \u2013 this compared with a cut in spending power of over \u00a3358m, Labour claims. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: \u201cThese figures show that the areas with the highest homelessness deaths are facing the deepest cuts. This makes the prospect of reducing deaths ever more bleak. The government\u2019s \u00a330m to reduce the rough sleeping number has been pitiful so Britain\u2019s homelessness crisis is set to continue. \u201cThe next prime minister must put an end to this national shame of people dying on our streets and back Labour\u2019s plans to end rough sleeping and build thousands more affordable homes.\u201d The homeless death figures, which are estimates, were calculated by checking death registrations in England and Wales for indications that a person was homeless at or near their time of death. ONS researchers searched for terms such as \u201cno fixed abode\u201d in records, also checking whether the address included in the death registration belonged to a night shelter or a hostel. The figures are in contrast with the change in spending power per household in each council between 2010-11 and 2019-20, which come from official government statistics. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \u201cEvery death on our streets is a tragedy \u2026 That\u2019s why we are investing \u00a31.2bn to tackle homelessness and have bold plans backed by \u00a3100m to end rough sleeping in its entirety. Councils have used this funding to create an estimated 2,600 more bed spaces and 750 additional specialist support staff this year. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring independent reviews into the deaths of rough sleepers are conducted where appropriate \u2013 and where this does not happen we will hold local authorities to account."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
