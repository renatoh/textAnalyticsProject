The England manager's ability to find a system that brings more out of the Liverpool captain at the World Cup promises to have a significant bearing on whether his team finally progress beyond a quarter-final. With Gerrard in Champions League winning mode, England would be far more fearsome. Asked a few weeks ago to recall the last time he felt he had played really well for England, Gerrard was stumped. \"It was quite a while ago,\" he said. \"I don't know.\" Arguably the midfielder's last stellar showing came in the 5-1 win over Germany in 2001. There is no lobby for his removal but many fans will watch his display tomorrow with particular interest. England will need to beat teams of Argentina's calibre to realise their ambitions next summer and it would be highly encouraging to see Eriksson lay a platform from which Gerrard finds his usual club form. England's most positive display for a while, in the 2-1 win against Poland last month, came with Gerrard injured. That match saw Ledley King, a midfield substitute in the win against Austria four days earlier, start as a holding midfielder and it is logical that Eriksson wants to try identical tactics tomorrow, albeit with Gerrard replacing Joe Cole and David Beckham coming in for Shaun Wright-Phillips. It seems to offer the best hope of unlocking Gerrard's potential and the team's attacking capacity without being weaker at the back. Frank Lampard seemed liberated against Poland by King's presence in the role Claude Makelele fills for him at Chelsea. The notion that a centre-half might solve England's midfield problems is unusual. But assuming King can cope with the test offered by Argentina, his fellow midfielders should thrive. Beckham is used to playing from the right, Lampard from the left of a trio at his club, and Gerrard has spent most of his career operating centrally without huge defensive responsibility. A partnership of Lampard and Gerrard in a flat midfield four has lacked balance and failed to live up to expectation, and King should free them to get on with what they do best. \"The first thought of both of them when they get the ball is, let's go and hurt the opponent,\" says Howard Wilkinson, the former Leeds and England Under-21 manager. \"I would think their intuitive, instinctive play - which a lot of football is to a degree - is clouded by having the responsibility of being the guardian of the back door. \"Football at the very top level is, when it comes down to it, instinctive and subconscious, particularly the creative side. It's very difficult to ask a very gifted creative player to recognise that he is maybe going to shoulder the predominant defending role. \"If you say, 'A third of your game is going to be about making sure we don't get hit on the break, and so on', I think actually concentrating on doing it well means it becomes a lot bigger than a third because it's not as instinctive as the other bits. I'm sure if you said to Steven Gerrard: 'Do that job and you will be judged solely on that in this one game,' he could do it. But in general I think he is the man for all seasons.\" Wilkinson points out that King's presence would have other benefits. Protection for the back four would make it easier for the full-backs to get forward, vital in a team without an old-fashioned winger. Moreover, it would enable Lampard and Gerrard to link up better with Wayne Rooney, who likes to drop deep. \"Having that triangle of Rooney, Lampard and Gerrard and not knowing where the hell they're going to appear next is a great problem [for opponents].\" He coached King in the Under-21s and has no doubt the Tottenham captain could shine in midfield. \"I don't mean it to be the direct comparison that it sounds, but Bobby Moore had no problem playing in front of the back four or playing in it,\" says Wilkinson. \"I think he's the same. When you look at what he's got I don't think either is a problem to him. \"Physically he's one hell of a specimen, he's comfortable on the ball, his defending qualities are there for all to see. He's quick, well balanced, good in the air and to ask him to play the defensive role is to ask him to do what comes naturally.\" Though Eriksson will not countenance it, an alternative proposed by Chris Waddle is a switch to 3-5-2, with King or Rio Ferdinand stepping out to help in midfield. Waddle was part of the England team who changed to that system from 4-4-2 during Italia 90 and reached the semi-finals with Mark Wright as sweeper. In Lampard, Gerrard and Beckham he sees similar players to himself, David Platt and Paul Gascoigne, the central midfield trio 15 years ago. \"I wouldn't say our greatest strength was tracking back but we could say to Wrighty, 'There's someone coming on', and he would pick them up. You have to look at our strengths in this squad. We have a lot of good centre-halves and midfield players and have to use that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
