While it sounds like your average inflammatory, exploitative true-crime documentary, this three-part series is actually a balanced and nuanced look at capital punishment and the moral complexities of justice in the US, and Texas in particular. \u201cThirty years ago, I killed a man,\u201d says Dale Wayne Sigler, in an interview given when he was still behind bars. Softly spoken and emotional, he gives a crisp, but devastating account of his early life. He says his mother was \u201ca child having children\u201d; his father was violent and abusive. Sigler was molested when he was 10. His early adult life was a mess of drugs and petty crime. He lived on the streets. In 1990, he robbed a Subway sandwich shop at gunpoint. When the shop assistant, John William Zeltner Jr, fled to the back room in fear, Sigler shot him six times, killing him. Then he took $400 from the till. After a tipoff to the police, Sigler confessed to the crime. In 1991, he was sentenced to death. Itamar Klasmer, the series\u2019 director, is careful at all points to ensure that, while this is Sigler\u2019s story, it also leaves room for Zeltner, his victim. Tommy Lenoir, one of the homicide detectives assigned to the case, explains why it was considered to be more serious than a robbery gone wrong. He calls the shooting \u201cexecution style\u201d because Sigler shot Zeltner so many times. Greg Miller, from the prosecution team, described it as \u201cparticularly heinous\u201d and \u201cpretty cold-hearted\u201d. For the first half of the episode, it is fairly true-crime-by-numbers. But the twists, though small, do come \u2013 and take the story in a new direction. In 1993, Texas changed its laws regarding jury selection. Sigler\u2019s team argued successfully that this invalidated his sentence, which was changed to life imprisonment. He would be eligible for parole in 30 years. Miller calls him \u201ca very lucky man\u201d. No doubt Sigler would consider it God, rather than luck, that has led him to freedom. In prison, he found religion and is now a minister. When he talks about his life, he has the cadence and conviction of a pastor. The rest of A Killer Uncaged \u2013 the title sounds more and more ludicrous the more we see of Sigler, known to his fellow prisoners as the Gentle Giant \u2013 follows his journey to release, and how he became one of only seven convicts in Texas to walk free from death row. The series touches on psychological points that it never delves into with any depth, at least in this first episode, although it should get there when Sigler leaves prison. On the day he finds out his release has been approved, he talks about fellow prisoners, who have told him that he won\u2019t be able to fathom the changes in society \u2013 mobile phones, colours, noises. A trip to a shopping centre made one of his friends feel sick. Sigler knows that the notion of rehabilitation, the idea that a killer can change, is controversial and politically unpopular. \u201cPeople will believe you\u2019re a monster, you\u2019re an animal,\u201d he says. But it is a credit to the documentary that it puts forward both points of view without judgment. It would be remiss to give Sigler alone the stage. Klasmer tracks down Zeltner\u2019s family and allows them to talk about the person they lost. His two half-brothers fondly reminisce about the man they reconnected with when he was in his 20s. They supported Sigler being given the death penalty and were only aggrieved that there would be a wait before he was executed. They wanted him gone, immediately. They see the legal changes that reduced the sentence to life as a failure of the justice system. One brother insists that he will soon kill again. This opening episode sets the scene, but it is the \u201cuncaging\u201d that promises to be the most intriguing. How will Sigler cope after 30 years of incarceration? To meet the conditions of his parole, he has to register at a permanent address, so he moves in with a pen pal, Carole Whitworth, a \u201ccountry gal\u201d cat-lover in her 70s whom he calls \u201cMama Carole\u201d. Her family are wary of her decision. In fact, a conversation with Whitworth\u2019s grandson and his girlfriend seems to cut to the heart of what this documentary is all about. He ponders her decision and says: \u201cPeople change.\u201d \u201cNot really,\u201d says his girlfriend, shaking her head."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
