The International Monitoring Commission is expected to point the finger at the Provisional IRA over the theft of more than two million pounds' worth of cigarettes in Belfast last month. Their report comes amid fresh evidence of ongoing IRA activity, including robberies and allegations of intelligence gathering on both sides of the Irish border. A non-jury court case running in Dublin has also thrown up allegations of an IRA spy ring directed at senior politicians in the Republic. However, both the British and Irish governments remain highly optimistic about a major act of IRA decommissioning in the next few weeks. John de Chastelain, the Canadian general overseeing the destruction of IRA and loyalist arms, briefed the Irish government this weekend over progress towards decommissioning. Last night a prominent unionist predicted that if the IMC reported ongoing IRA activity it would have serious implications for the chances of a deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists aimed to restoring powersharing government. Jeffrey Donaldson, the Lagan Valley MP, said that the IMC report would make it all the more difficult for a deal to be done this autumn. 'The IMC report will say, I predict, that terrorist activity is winding down,' he said. 'But there is ongoing criminality. There can't be a future without paramilitarism unless all aspects of it, including criminality, ends.' Sources close to the IMC told The Observer that the body would blame PIRA for the robbery of more than \u00a32 million worth of cigarettes last month. During the heist a lorry driver and his family were held captive in their native Ardoyne, a republican stronghold in north Belfast. 'No one else but the Provos would have the organisation, sophistication and ability to distribute the stolen cigarettes,' said one source. 'Nor would anyone else dare hold a family captive in Ardoyne but them.' The IMC's findings will be based on a report from the Chief Constable Hugh Orde. So far the PSNI chief has refused to publish his report or state which terror group was responsible. Orde has been challenged by members of the North's Policing Board to publish the findings of the PSNI investigation before the IMC report. The British government had been hoping that a second IMC report would bolster the chances of a political deal. It is understood the IMC will conclude terrorist activity over the past six months has significantly diminished. In Dublin, meanwhile, there has been fierce resistance and heavy briefing against the IMC investigating IRA activity in the Republic. Sources close to the IMC claim that senior figures in the Department of Foreign Affairs are questioning whether the IMC should even have an office and investigative capacity south of the border. 'They don't want the IMC talking to garda officers or the alleged victims of punishment shootings in Dublin for fear what they might find. They are openly asking why we need an IMC office in the Republic at all.' At Dublin's Special Criminal Court the trial continues tomorrow of a Crumlin man accused of IRA membership. Niall Binead also stands accused of having the personal details of several TDs including a minister in the last Cabinet as well as 30 unnamed individuals. Last week prosecuting counsel George Birmingham SC told the court that the documents found in the briefcase at the home of Niall Binead 'related to the activities and movements of a number of elected representatives, members of Dail Eireann from different political parties'. Niall Binead, also known as Niall Bennett, 35, of Faughart Road, Crumlin, and Kenneth Donohue, 26, of Sundale Avenue, Mountain View, Tallaght, have pleaded not guilty to membership of an illegal organisation styling itself the Irish Republican Army, otherwise Oglaigh na hEireann, otherwise the IRA, on 10 October, 2002."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
