Contracts for a year that begins with the defence of the Ashes in Australia and a World Cup in the Caribbean have been given to three players with long-term injuries, Michael Vaughan, Ashley Giles and Simon Jones, even though it cannot be certain that Vaughan and Jones, in particular, will ever be fit enough again to play regular international cricket. England have also stood by Marcus Trescothick, whose therapy for a stress-related illness has precluded him going to India for the Champions Trophy, and Steve Harmison, whose distaste for one-day cricket has never been more apparent. But whichever of Read or Jones is chosen for the first Ashes Test in Brisbane they will do so as a member of the poor bloody infantry, unsure of their worth. David Graveney, England's chairman of selectors, said: \"The selectors were keen to demonstrate our support and faith in those players who are recovering from long-term injuries but remain an important part of our plans as we prepare for an intensive programme of international cricket in both forms of the game over the next 12 months. While Vaughan, Jones and Giles have been deemed worthy of loyalty, the wicketkeepers are left with an incentive - prove yourself invaluable this winter and a summer contract will be yours. Kevin Pietersen won such a contract before the 2005 Ashes series. \"The selectors can award summer contracts to individuals from next April if we feel that performances on overseas tours merit this,\" said Graveney, \"and I am sure that Chris Read and Geraint Jones will be competing hard to demonstrate their value to the team this winter.\" Read replaced Jones for the final two Tests of the summer but, while he performed adequately with bat and behind the stumps, he did not settle the argument in his favour. England's shunning of them both suggests they are considering other alternatives for next summer with Worcestershire's young keeper-batsman, Stephen Davies among those touted. Others to miss out are Liam Plunkett, Sajid Mahmood and James Anderson although Monty Panesar and Alastair Cook have been awarded contracts. England central contracts 2006-07 Ian Bell (Warwickshire), Paul Collingwood (Durham), Alastair Cook (Essex), Andrew Flintoff (Lancashire), Ashley Giles (Warwickshire), Steve Harmison (Durham), Matthew Hoggard (Yorkshire), Simon Jones (Glamorgan), Kevin Pietersen (Hampshire), Monty Panesar (Northamptonshire), Andrew Strauss (Middlesex), Marcus Trescothick (Somerset), Michael Vaughan (Yorkshire)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
