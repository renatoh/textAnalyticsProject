Titled The Numbers: Jonny, Thom and a CR78, which is a reference to a Roland drum machine, the video features guitarist Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke sitting on a bench while playing the song. Shot in Tarzana, California, it is the third video he has produced for the band\u2019s current album. The release follows Anderson\u2019s video for Present Tense, which saw the same setup featuring Greenwood and Yorke, and Daydreaming, which followed a more conventional music video setup and saw Yorke walking through various scenes. The director has links with the band due to his work with Jonny Greenwood, who has composed Oscar-nominated music for Anderson\u2019s films, including The Master and his atonal, unsettling score for There Will Be Blood. Anderson also worked with Greenwood on the documentary Junun, which followed the guitarist\u2019s work with musicians in Rajasthan in north-west India. Greenwood has also collaborated with lauded Polish classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki when the pair worked together on the 2012 album, 48 Responses to Polymorphia. The album\u2019s first video, for the song Burn the Witch, was accused of breaching copyright over its similarity to the children\u2019s TV show Trumpton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
