Kevin Keegan's successor is alarmed by the Newcastle owner's reluctance to invest in the squad this month and does not seem to have been swayed by Ashley's offer of a lucrative new contract, which would extend his stay on Tyneside until the summer of 2011. Kinnear, currently contracted until June, feels deeply concerned that his side, who lost 3\u20130 at Blackburn on Saturday, are without a win in six games and today admitted: \"We're not too good to go down. People say we're too good to go down but we're fighting a relegation battle. It's a fantastic club, there's no question about that, but they [the board] need to give the fans what they want,\" stressed the 62-year-old, who suspects that he is losing his fight to keep Shay Given at St James' Park. \"We've got a horrendous injury list and there are a fair amount of players we need to bring in but I want to make sure I'm in a position to do that. I've identified the players I want but whether we get them is another thing. I sit down and talk to them [Ashley and Derek Llambias, Newcastle's managing director] about my ideas. I want to bring my own players in and that's the thing I really need to sort out. If we don't get stronger it will get tight. \"Can I bring in the players I want \u2013 and can I get rid of the players I don't want? I've got an offer of a two-and-a-half year contract here and I'm just mulling it over. I'll make that decision later. I've got the offer in writing and I'm quite happy with everything, except one or two things I want to sort out.\" Kinnear's comments suggest a degree of tension with Dennis Wise, Newcastle's director of football, whose choice of transfer targets did not always chime with Keegan's ideas. Indeed, like Keegan, Kinnear feels the board are not listening to him and fears Newcastle's squad could be left dangerously thin. He has been told he has around \u00a310m to spend but Rennes and St Etienne have rejected two \u00a35m bids for the midfielder Stephane Mbia and the striker Bafetimbi Gomis respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
