Kompany sustained a 13th separate calf injury since joining City in August 2008 when he limped off against Sunderland on Boxing Day. The club captain had been on the field nine minutes as a second-half replacement, having just returned from a previous strain to the muscle that occurred during the goalless draw at Aston Villa in early November. The 29-year-old may be ruled out until the latter part of this month and there is concern regarding the long-term effect on Kompany\u2019s ability to feature regularly. Asked if the Belgian\u2019s career might be in the balance, Pellegrini said: \u201cWe hope not. We hope that this must be a moment of his career. I think that he is a very professional player. He and the club and are going to do all we can to try to help him.\u201d The Chilean could not rule out Kompany having to nurse the injury for the remainder of his career. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to answer these questions because I repeat again, I am not a doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of players at some moments of their career have a bad season for different injuries. I hope this is the part of the season for Kompany and the second part he will be fit. If not, of course, I repeat we must try to do everything we can do to try to know why.\u201d At the halfway point of the season City are third with 36 points, three behind Leicester \u2013 with whom they drew on Tuesday \u2013 and the leaders, Arsenal. Despite Kompany\u2019s importance, Pellegrini feels sure his side can win the title should he be absent for the majority of the second half of this campaign. \u201cWe are going to win the title if we don\u2019t depend on just one player,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who it is. You don\u2019t want to depend on just one player because you have a good squad. Everyone must demonstrate their performance in every game and more important than just one name is to have a performance as a team, which I think we had against Leicester in the last game. \u201cIf we add those important individual performances I am sure we are going to be involved in the fight for the title.\u201d City travel to Watford for Saturday\u2019s late kick-off without an away league win since 12 September \u2013 1-0 at Crystal Palace \u2013 and collecting only three points from six subsequent matches on the road. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s psychological. You have to see every game why we didn\u2019t win,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cAgainst Tottenham we played very well in the first half,\u201d he said of the 4-1 defeat. \u201cWe conceded two goals which were offside but it wasn\u2019t a bad performance, although the result wasn\u2019t what we wanted. Against Stoke [a 2-0 defeat] we played very bad, so you can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play very well.\u201d Examining a trio of goalless draws, he said: \u201cAgainst Aston Villa I think we were very unlucky not to win, against Manchester United was a very close game as normal and was a good draw, and the last game against Leicester I don\u2019t think we played badly. \u201cSo if you tell me how happy I am with the results of the six games \u2013 no. But if you ask me how happy I am about the performances \u2013 [apart from] Stoke, the complete game, and the second half of Tottenham, I think the other games we didn\u2019t do bad.\u201d Pellegrini does believe, however, that City\u2019s away form will have to improve if the title is to be secured. \u201cYou don\u2019t know but of course we must improve,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot continue not winning away but in the other sense we are the strongest team at home. In the second round of games at home we play all the teams that are near our position, against Arsenal, against Leicester, Crystal Palace, Manchester United, Tottenham, we need to play at home. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to try and be a consistent team away and at home and to add more points than the other teams.\u201d Sergio Ag\u00fcero may play for 90 minutes against Watford, having returned from a heel injury but not completing his subsequent two appearances, against Arsenal and Leicester. \u201cI hope he scores two or three goals,\u201d Pellegrini said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
