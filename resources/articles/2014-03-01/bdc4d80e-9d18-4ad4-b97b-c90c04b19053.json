The Six Nations title cannot be won with a grand slam but may yet be claimed by a team that will have lost twice, thus ushering the side that were try-less and generally woeful against Ireland and England into the mix. The sums do not weigh heavily in Scotland's favour. It would appear certain that the title will be decided on points difference, and the Scots sit at the moment on a hefty deficit of 41, compared with Ireland who enjoy a surplus of 42. A swing of 84 points may be slightly taxing and may oblige the Scots to expand their repertoire beyond the finishing skills of Alex Dunbar. Or he could score 17 tries, to finish with a personal tally of 19 for the campaign. That would still not be enough to make him the centre of attention. There will be no upstaging Brian O'Driscoll, who is about to launch \u2013 cramp, concussion and back-slapping permitting \u2013 a mini-series of lasts. His last game at home, against Italy, will be followed by his last game full stop, against France in Paris. The waves of adoration will drown all other sound and may well give a boost to Ireland's more grounded designs on the title. Joe Schmidt has transformed them into a quick-response unit, adaptable and eager for instruction. Peter O'Mahony has stooped to conquer at the breakdown, a human clamp on the ball placed by bodies parked incorrectly by mere fractions of an inch. Every successful campaign throws up new characters and O'Mahony is one of them, the perfect bridge over the ball and the perfect bridge between the ferocious rugby-playing Irishmen of wilder times and the more contained disciples of their New Zealander coach. Such an advancement of one player is compensation for what gives elsewhere in the shifting sands. In truth O'Driscoll is not the player he once was. Emotion will carry him to the end but little menace lurks now in the Irish midfield. Gordon D'Arcy's footwork used to dance him forward but he was stepping on the spot at Twickenham. O'Driscoll has altered his approach countless times, since the day in 2000 when he scorched across the Stade de France to score a hat-trick of tries, depending on which parts of his body remain viable. But it would appear that his brain is now all that remains intact. It is not the worst tool but to be hailed as someone who offers experience and wisdom in organising things is not much of fanfare. It may not matter. Even without Jonathan Sexton, who is nursing a damaged thumb and remains a doubt, Ireland should be going to the last game \u2013 in Paris, scene of that entrance by BOD \u2013 even more firmly in control of their destiny than they are right now. Points should come in the second half at the Aviva against Italy, who must be wearied now by their stern resistance and not a win to show for it. If there is energy left in Sergio Parisse's squad, would it not be better saved for a tilt at England in the last game, at home in Rome? In what condition might Chris Robshaw's men be travelling to face the Italians that have never beaten them? It all depends on what happens first at Twickenham. Each round has had its highlight: France-England in round one; Ireland-Wales in two; England-Ireland in three. Each game has been a notch up on the one before, and the one to come is no exception: England-Wales. Similar to Wales's game in Dublin, it has a backdrop. Not the bitterness of the Warren Gatland-O'Driscoll fall-out from the Lions tour but the equally potent hurt of the result from Cardiff last March. It was England's grand slam chance and they left with nothing. And it has been their reference point, the needle in their eye, ever since. Wales have faced the intensity that goes with being back-to-back champions, the team to beat, the special scalp, and been found wanting once. Ireland dismantled them up front and punished them cruelly. Now Wales have to face vengeful Twickenham \u2013 the humiliation of last March stretched deep into the tiers of England fans at the Millennium Stadium \u2013 and the determination of Stuart Lancaster's side. It is no mean combination, a stadium in raw humour and a team with jaw set. Mike Brown sums them up, severe of appearance, supple of limb, a full-back whose every contribution stirs his home stadium into an adoring frenzy. Wales would counter that they, too, are braced for the showdown, having used their unimpressive performance against Ireland as a whip to their resolve against France. The invitation to go out and play like champions, extended by Gatland before the start of the championship, was replaced with a more chilling message: perform or be gone. Wales opted to perform, launching an onslaught through their admirably steamed up scrummagers, Adam Jones and Gethin Jenkins, and reducing Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9's forwards to a state of sardonic haplessness. England-Wales at Twickenham, never exactly on the soft side of bristling, will be gorgeously abrasive. France stay on the road, their coach reminding his players of some ancient values by omitting Louis Picamoles, who applauded the referee, Alain Rolland, for sending him to the sin-bin. It is an interesting one, for there is something of the preacher about Rolland and players are obviously irked by his insistence on showing who is in control, but such asides as the gesture by Picamoles undermine one of the essential virtues of the game \u2013 that whatever the referee is or does, he is beyond public reproach. France will be vulnerable in Scotland to the fervour of another team restored. Mathematically challenging as Scotland's prospects are, they are perfectly poised to compound France's apparent lack of devotion to the cause of playing for their country. Everything about Murrayfield, from the nematodes that are causing the carpet of grass to fray to the crumbling cohesion in the away changing room, should favour Scotland. Of all the home victories in round four this may be the most straightforward. Home victories? England to beat Wales? Well, here is a theory. England will squeeze past Wales in a game that exacts a high price. Nothing life-threatening; just the strains and deep-seated bruises that come with rugby at the opposite end of the spectrum of engagement to France's current indifference. England-Wales will be so very percussive that the victors will travel to Rome in a state of patched-up susceptibility to a last-round stumble. Wales in that same fifth round will recover to beat Scotland in Cardiff and France \u2013 with perhaps the irascible and reselected Morgan Parra stroking the kicks over \u2013 will be shamed into a performance against Ireland, upsetting O'Driscoll's farewell on the field but not draining every last drop from the old boy. He will have the strength left to help raise aloft the trophy, won on clear points difference from England, Wales and France, all four having lost two games. It will not happen \u2013 obviously. But something wonderful and weird will. It always does."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
