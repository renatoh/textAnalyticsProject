A letter written by one inmate and obtained with permission by Guardian Australia said women should be moved into the male-only prison Hakea immediately, rather than waiting more than 12 months for a dividing wall to be built. Poetry written by another inmate described conditions at the prison. She writes: Doors are locked at six-thirty Sleeping on the floor \u2013 feels dirty. Toilet just there for two of us to bare So hot in here, causes so much despair. On Monday there were 323 women living at Bandyup, down from a record high of 340 two weeks ago. The ageing facility was built for 220 people but women have been sharing cells to make room, with some sleeping on mattresses on the floor. Most of the prison is not air-conditioned. The corrective services minister, Joe Francis, announced in December that 256 women would be moved to Hakea remand prison, which, like Bandyup, is located in Perth\u2019s suburban fringe, as soon as a dividing wall can be built between the units intended for women and the wider male prison population. But the prisoner\u2019s letter said conditions at Bandyup would reach a \u201ccrisis\u201d point by the time the wall was complete. \u201cSome female prisoners cannot safely be doubled up with others because of their history of sexual predation or harming others. Doubling these women up places other prisoners at risk,\u201d the writer said. \u201cThe department has a duty of care to these vulnerable prisoners that they are refusing to honour.\u201d Marc Newhouse from Bandyup Action Group said the woman\u2019s willingness to move unsegregated into the male prison population showed how desperate conditions at Bandyup had become. \u201cMany of the women in Bandyup will have abusive partners in Hakea,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we don\u2019t support this suggestion.\u201d Double-bunking in the women\u2019s prison estate has spread to Boronia pre-release centre, WA\u2019s flagship women\u2019s rehabilitation facility. The Department of Corrective Services confirmed some women were \u201csharing rooms\u201d at Boronia, which it said was designed to be large enough for double-occupancy, and suggested that \u201cmany female prisoners request to share a cell for companionship, peer support, wellbeing and orientation into the prison environment\u201d. \u201cThis arrangement can be particularly beneficial for new, vulnerable or special-needs prisoners as they adapt to life in prison.\u201d But the opposition prisons spokesman, Paul Papalia, said the justification of new, nervous prisoners did not make sense at Boronia, which is intended as a last stop for long-term prisoners to prepare them for release into the outside world. Papalia said double-bunking at Boronia also undermined one of its key features, which was to allow women to have their children to stay overnight with them. \u201cIf you\u2019re sharing a room, obviously your children can\u2019t stay,\u201d he said. Papalia repeated a call for women to be moved into the privately run 80-bed Wandoo prison, a facility that is tailored to young men. That suggestion is supported by the Bandyup Action Group and the Western Australian Prison Officers\u2019 Union. Francis has ruled out that option. Instead, the department said 30 women would move to the new Eastern Goldfields regional prison in June. The union\u2019s secretary, John Welch, said small additions such as Eastern Goldfields were not enough to keep pace with the growth in female prisoner numbers, which have grown from 475 in March 2014 to 525 on Monday. He said concerns about interrupting the specialist program for Wandoo\u2019s 50 or so young male prisoners \u2013 who could be moved into new units at Acacia, WA\u2019s other Serco-run prison \u2013 should not be prioritised over the \u201ccrisis\u201d in women\u2019s prisons. \u201cWe are in a crisis in women\u2019s prisons and it\u2019s great that we can think about what\u2019s ideal for young male prisoners, but we are not thinking in the same way about female prisoners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actually need to put some priority into women\u2019s prisons for a change.\u201d Welch said conditions at Bandyup were appalling and could lead to a higher rate of recidivism. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that prisons should be luxurious experiences, but they should be decent,\u201d he said. Newhouse said pressure on prisons could be reduced immediately if the government provided the legal assistance necessary for women to use existing mechanisms \u2013 such as bail and parole \u2013 to secure their release. He said the government could also \u201ceasily\u201d change the policy on fine defaulting to allow more outstanding fines to be served out as community service orders, rather than prison time. Instead, Francis has promised to increase the jail time required to \u201ccut out\u201d a fine. People with outstanding fines in WA can \u201ccut out\u201d the amount owed at a rate of $250 per day of jail time. Newhouse said the action group was examining the legal grounds to push for a review of all sentenced prisoners in Bandyup and a mass amnesty of low-level offences in order to deal with chronic overcrowding. He said many women in Bandyup were not dangerous and would not be there were it not for the state\u2019s tough-on-crime laws. Guardian Australia has been told of one woman, a homeless amputee, who was charged with assaulting the police officer called to \u201ccalm her down\u201d after someone let down the tyres of her wheelchair. Under WA law she was sentenced to a mandatory 12 months in jail for assaulting a public officer. \u201cWe have been calling for a review of mandatory sentencing laws for years, and it\u2019s fallen on deaf ears,\u201d Newhouse said. \u201cThey can play around with the sentences bit by bit but eventually they are going to have to change the law.\u201d He said a whole-of-government approach was needed that would think about law and order, what is effective, and what is not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
