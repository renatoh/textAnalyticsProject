The Fiver finally came to this morning with raging dehydration issues. Granted, the Fiver also awoke with double vision and a strange mucus smeared across its face, testimony to another skinful down the Dog &amp; Daggers the previous night. Stumbling to the tap, we soon realised mere water could not sate us, for this was the kind of raging thirst that only the return of Big-Cup-tussles-that-actually-matter can satisfy. Cue jubilant air punch at the prospect of the final round of second phase matches: Newcastle v Barcelona and Valencia v Arsenal. Reinvigorated, the Fiver skipped over to the wireless and re-tuned it into Toon FM, only to find that Rir Sobby Bobson's mind seemed once again to have wandered. \"There will be little budgerigars and canaries,\" he mumbled, \"I would think, singing around the stadium all night long.\" Eventually, the Fiver fathomed that he meant transistor radios, which would be relaying news of the Leverkusen v Inter tie. \"I'm sure the message will be getting to me, but I think we've just got to keep it away from the players,\" he added, having finally relocated his marbles. \"Think of the victory, have belief, have a confidence in what we can do and just go out there and try to win this difficult game.\" Before he could mention that Gary Speed will be missing or that the already-qualified Barca will field a team comprised of juniors and laundry women, a copy of London's London Evening Standard came crashing through the door. (Literally, it's a rough estate.) Ah, there's Arsene Wenger, playing his team selection for the game close to his chest. \"At the moment we are pushing Sol to play in this game, even though I'd say it is 40-60 against him,\" opined the poker-faced professor, of a game Arsenal could lose and still progress. \"We'll wait until the last minute to decide because it's the sort of match you want him for.\" As he mumbled something about risking Kolo Toure at left-back, a brutal thump at the front door shook the house. Oh cripes, it's Barcelona's straight-talking coach, Mad Raddy Antic, keen to set a few things straight. \"I would be surprised to see the English teams challenge,\" he barked, as the Fiver cowered and hoped he'd go away. \"Manchester United are doing great, but Arsenal and Newcastle are virtually out of the competition,\" he cackled, before poking his bent beak through the letter box and turning his attention to wor Alan. \"I seriously doubt whether he would have scored as many goals in Spain as he has in the Premiership,\" he snorted, twisting the knife with glee, \"marking him well and not letting him touch the ball will limit his threat.\" Bad-mouthing him and giving him a reason to net a hat-trick will surely increase it. * * * * * * * * * * * * DREAMING WITH JOHN HARTSON 1. Aaagh! No! Mummy! Why have I been arrested outside a Newcastle nightspot called Buffalo Joe's - \"an amazing western fun theme bar on the Gateshead Quays\" - in the early hours of a crisp December morning? 2. Wake up and realise it was all just a bad dream. You couldn't have been arrested that night as you'd passed out following a peanut and pork scratching's binge. Phew! The benefits of a high-fat diet! Nevertheless, resolve never to eat an entire truckle of Stilton before bed again. Well, not this week anyway. 3. Swig on bedside bottle of Regaine to calm nerves. Get up. Clean teeth. Wash face. Brush hair (off pillow, into bin). Switch on radio to hear news bulletin. 4. As you pass your Player of the Month for March Award (from Rangers) on your way back from the bathroom, you half-catch the news that someone from Celtic has been fined \u00a32,300. Have Weight Watcher's found you out again? 5. Turns out it's not you, but the club - a punishment for the \"provocative behaviour\" of Celtic fans in the El Hadji Diouf spitting incident. Phew! 6. Co-incidentally, the next news item concerns Celtic trio Joos Valgaeren, Johan Mjallby and Bobby Petta. (Mmm, Trio. Treee-oh! Want a Trio and want one now!) They were arrested outside Buffalo Joe's - \"an amazing western fun theme bar on the Gateshead Quays\" - in the early hours of a crisp December morning and thrown into police custody. Mmm, custard. 7. Discover that charges have been dropped \"as there is insufficient evidence to support a prosecution\". Do packets of peanuts and pork scratchings not constitute evidence? * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"All I know is that Bill Shankly would have done the same\" - n. delusion of grandeur, thinking like Gerard Houllier (especially when dealing with players who spit). * * * * * * * * * * * * COLE-D TURKEY Like a resinous bud with a double indica hashish taste and oh-so-sweet aroma, age is usually a wonderful mellower - as anyone who's ever seen Blackburn Rovers up close knows. Look! There's nice old Graeme Souness, who in a previous incarnation broke more legs than Beechers Brook, sobbing away at the thought of their Worthington Cup triumph. And look! There's Andy Cole, who once released the rap record, Outstanding, (\"Andy Cole, break it down\"), changing his name to Andrew to sound more mature. Sweet isn't it? [Cali-like pause while the Fiver's age-is-a-great-mellower thesis is torn apart like a Camden crack house following a police raid, as Souness moans about Cole's attitude in training, Cole storms off home in a \"Mariah-don't-do-stairs\" huff, and the pair refuse to apologise at a subsequent meeting]. Oh dear: the Fiver's mellow has been harshed, hasn't it? Still, while today's papers predicted Cole was on his way out of Blackburn (Manchester City, naturally, were considered the most likely suitors), his agent, Paul Stretford was flicking through his bumper book of football clich\u00bfs, and claiming all was not lost. \"At the end of the day, there has been a storm in a six-yard box and somewhere, somehow it has been whipped up into a feeding frenzy,\" said Stretford, delightfully mixing his metaphors. \"Discussions are on-going and further discussions are planned.\" And what do you know? About 59 minutes after the Fiver's 4pm copy deadline (what?), Graeme and Andy resolved their differences. \"They sat down together over a cup of tea and chatted things through,\" Blackburn chief executive John Williams sighed to Rovers website, www.rovers.co.uk: \"I am happy to report that the situation has now been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties. Andy will now rejoin the squad tomorrow for training ahead of Saturday's game at Newcastle.\" Excuse us while we wipe a tear from our eyes. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL David Moyes wants Celtic's Stilian Petrov - known as the King in Bulgaria - to lord it over his midfield in Europe next season. Marseilles' Belgian centre back Daniel Van Buyten won't stop harping on about how much Manchester United want him. Peter Rid-sale could ditch Ell Tel if Leeds lose to Liverpool at the weekend. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The final vestiges of flesh are slowly falling off the skeleton that was once called Leeds United as 17 club employees are facing the sack. Popular chairman Peter Ridsdale said: \"On March 7, 2003, Leeds United plc announced its intent to reduce its cost base by approximately \u00a33m on an annualised basis. Today, we have entered into a formal consultation process with 17 employees.\" Or in plain English: you 17 there, you're sacked. Birmingham striker Tommy Mooney has agreed to join First Division strugglers Derby on a one-month loan deal. The 31-year-old could be involved against Nottingham Forest tonight if the formalities of the deal are completed in time. Watford have offered six players new contracts despite announcing a \u00a35.48m interim loss. In case you're still reading, those players are: Tommy Smith, Neil Cox, Alec Chamberlain, Marcus Gayle, Gary Fisken and Jack Smith. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV1: Champions League - Highlights (11pm &amp; 1.20am) No word of thanks yet from Luka, so we're stuck with his theme for a little while longer. That theme, for latecomers and the absent-minded, is that Luka's web-illiterate brother has finally realised he's wasting his life working in a call centre for a popular catalogue company. So he asked Luka to ask us if we could ask you for your advice, and the possible solutions literally trickled in... Football League Extra (3.25am) Take it away, Roy Ward. \"My top five(r) suggestions for getting fired are as follows ... 1. Start going in to work dressed EXACTLY like your boss and repeating everything he says slowly in a slightly lower tone. Sky One: Freddie Ljungberg... Close Up (11pm) \"2. Answer every call by speaking only in song lyrics, preferably Megadeath lyrics. Or simply say 'jive'. Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (7pm &amp; 12am) \"3. Attempt to answer every single phone in the call centre, snatching the headsets away from their owners if necessary. Gillette Soccer Special (7.30pm) \"4. Keep a wind-chime next to the phone and punctuate each sentence by lightly waving your hand through it and sighing. You're On Sky Sports (10pm &amp; 3am) \"And 5.

I'm not sure what sort it is but it's about palm-size in all directions and orange. Does anyone know if it is possible to get it trained, or failing that, what can be done for it?\" Newstalk 106: Off The Ball With Ger Gilroy (7pm) You know how it works by now, readers, if you can bring a little closure to poor Dan's flatmate's fish, or even Luka's brother for that matter, email the.boss@theguardian.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
