The Labour leader said it was essential that businesses be given an accurate assessment of the difficulties they may face under a no-deal Brexit, arguing that Johnson\u2019s reassurances \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d. The prime minister claimed on Monday that a no-deal Brexit would merely involve \u201cbumps in the road\u201d, despite the leaked Yellowhammer document predicting shortages of food, medicine and fuel. But Corbyn said these denials \u201cwill do nothing to give businesses or consumers any confidence that the dire state of affairs described in the documents aren\u2019t right around the corner\u201d. Speaking before a visit to businesses in Stevenage on Tuesday, Corbyn said: \u201cThe government\u2019s own Operation Yellowhammer dossier makes the chaos and damage that will be caused by Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit crystal clear. \u201cIf the government wants to be believed that it doesn\u2019t represent the real impact, it must publish its most recent assessments today in full.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat we know for sure is that this government is wilfully committed to a policy that the prime minister and the cabinet know will destroy jobs, push up food prices in the shops and open up our NHS to a takeover by US private companies.\u201d Corbyn joined calls from more than 100 MPs for a recall of parliament to address the worries about a no-deal Brexit, but Downing Street rejected that idea. Whitehall sources said Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal planning and Johnson\u2019s righthand man in the Vote Leave campaign, would address parliament about the UK\u2019s readiness to leave the EU without a deal when it returned in September. \u201cThe House of Commons agreed the date it would rise for summer recess, as well as its return on 3 September, and this was passed by a majority of close to 200 MPs,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said. Downing Street said the documents were out of date and had been prepared under Theresa May\u2019s government, even though they were dated and circulated in early August after Johnson had taken over as prime minister. \u201cIn relation to business, we have been engaging widely and will continue to do so, and that\u2019s been significantly stepped up in recent weeks,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe have published numerous documents on how businesses can prepare. \u201cYou can expect to see further information being published in the coming weeks in relation to how the public \u2026 can further prepare and the changes that they are likely to see across a range of areas.\u201d The Cabinet Office documents, marked \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d and reportedly prepared earlier this month, examined the government\u2019s contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. The files also said efforts to avoid the return of a hard border in Ireland were likely to prove \u201cunsustainable\u201d in such a scenario, with fears of \u201cdirect action\u201d and road blockades. A public information campaign targeting consumers is being prepared for the next couple of weeks, in which digital media, newspapers, TV and radio will be used to explain how people can prepare for Brexit. \u201cThe delay in information is that we have been preparing gov.uk for a massive traffic increase,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe know there is an appetite from the government for more information, particularly around no deal. It will be things like travel and passports, and [will be] more user-friendly.\u201d In further pressure on the government, Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit committee, wrote to Gove demanding clarification on aspects of the Yellowhammer report and calling on him to appear before the committee at the earliest opportunity when parliament returns. He asked to know the date on which the report was drawn up, any significant steps that the government has taken since then in the past three weeks, and how these have mitigated each of the risks identified in the report and to what extent. Since entering office, Johnson has been ramping up no-deal preparations, setting aside an extra \u00a32bn for contingency measures and mitigation. A new planning exercise, codenamed Yellow Rehearse, was reported by BuzzFeed to be taking place so that diplomats and Whitehall departments could run through the possible consequences of a no-deal Brexit in early October. The government did not confirm the operation but a spokesman said it \u201cregularly conducts scenario-based exercises to ensure its plans are robust, including in relation to Brexit\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
