The Electoral Commission visited the headquarters of the Brexit party in May and studied the way in which the party takes gifts through online payment systems including PayPal. A report released on Wednesday has concluded that the \u201cfundraising structure adopted by the party leaves it open to a high and ongoing risk of receiving and accepting impermissible donations\u201d. The party, which won 29 seats in last month\u2019s European elections, could face penalties unless it overhauls its fundraising system to ensure all donations above \u00a3500 come from the UK, as the law requires. The report comes as concerns grow about the possible influence of foreign governments in UK politics. The commission\u2019s director of regulation, Louise Edwards, said it was legitimate for any political party or campaigner to adopt a fundraising strategy that focused on raising small sums through online payment systems. \u201cOur visit to the Brexit party has enabled us to make specific recommendations to the party that will support it to meet its legal responsibilities when it comes to receiving funds,\u201d she said. \u201cShould it fail to meet those responsibilities, this will be considered in line with our enforcement policy.\u201d Donations of \u00a3500 or above must be made by a \u201cpermissible donor\u201d under UK law \u2013 someone who is listed on the electoral register or a company registered in the country which is \u201ccarrying on business\u201d. Parties have 30 days to return donations if they are unsure of their origin. The Brexit party said gifts of \u00a325 or less accounted for 90% of its total funding during the EU election campaign. It raised more than \u00a32m from small donors, thousands of whom paid \u00a325 each to become registered supporters. Amounts below \u00a3500 do not have to be declared to the commission, but some critics \u2013 among them the former PM Gordon Brown \u2013 have said there is no way of telling whether those smaller amounts come from British or foreign sources, and that the system may be being abused. Brown suggested the party was getting around the declaration rules by accepting many untraceable donations directly through PayPal and without a requirement to give details of the donor. Critics are concerned that an individual or a foreign power could make many small payments to a party, each less than \u00a3500, with no legal requirement for any details to be submitted. The commission said parties had a legal duty to check every payment they obtained online to ascertain the source of the donation and not to accept any that they were not entitled to. They should request as much information as possible to ensure all money was from a permissible source, it said. Asked about the issue during the campaign, Farage said the party\u2019s website \u201csays very clearly, do not donate unless you are on the electoral roll or eligible to vote\u201d. Labour and the Conservative also have the option to donate via PayPal on their websites, but the main parties claim they have safeguards in place which allow them to check the permissibility of donors. Labour and Liberal Democrat credit card systems require the donor\u2019s address to match the billing address. The Conservative party requires donors and members to pay through either its own card system or as a registered PayPal user. The Brexit party, which Farage founded four months ago, is fundraising so it can run a full slate of candidates in the next general election. It came second to Labour in last week\u2019s Peterborough byelection, pushing the Tories into third place. In a statement, the Brexit party said the commission had confirmed its method of fundraising was legitimate. \u201cThey haven\u2019t found any examples of infringement of Electoral Commission rules,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, we are grateful that they have made some helpful suggestions to reduce future risk as we fundraise, and we will be working to embrace those recommendations as soon as practicable and possible and in the timeframe set out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
