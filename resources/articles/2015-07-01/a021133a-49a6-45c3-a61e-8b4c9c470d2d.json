South Australia has drafted laws that would permanently tag members of motorcycle gangs as \u201ccriminal organisation participants\u201d, leaving them facing the lifetime risk of jail for associating with others even if they had quit a gang. The measures were introduced despite the South Australian government\u2019s blueprint being under review in Queensland, where its Labor counterpart has a taskforce to recommend ways to repeal or replace gang laws once touted as the world\u2019s toughest. University of Queensland\u2019s Rebecca Ananian-Welsh said it was the latest example of \u201cextreme measures\u201d adopted from terrorism legislation under the same rhetoric but without proof that they helped eradicate organised crime. Ananian-Welsh and the University of NSW professor George Williams in a recent study (pdf) traced the \u201ccreep\u201d of federal anti-terrorism laws, including the use of control orders, secret evidence, crimes of association and a shift in the burden of proof, into state criminal laws. They argued the Australian experience offered a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d to other countries, with high court judges unable to act on concerns in the absence of \u201cconstitutional protections for human rights or due process\u201d. Ananian-Welsh told Guardian Australia the South Australian bill had gone a step further than the Queensland laws by permanently eroding the rights of anyone who even tried to join a bikie gang. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you just flirted with the idea, attending a couple of meetings of a bikie gang in your youth means you are a member of a criminal organisation then, now and into the future,\u201d Ananian-Welsh said. \u201cIf you look down the track, the potential for overreach is massive and it\u2019s hard to grapple with how broad it could get. If a group suddenly disbanded or a couple of people broke away and formed a different group or became part of another organisation in no way related to bikies, would that then become a criminal organisation?\u201d The South Australian government on Tuesday dismissed opposition calls to allow judicial review of the its declaration of 27 bikie gangs as criminal organisations and for secret intelligence to be shared with a parliamentary committee. The SA attorney-general, John Rau, said: \u201cIf the opposition wants to inject the courts back into that process again, all they\u2019re going to do is guarantee that one, we\u2019ll be in court forever, two, we\u2019ll waste a great deal of money and three, we\u2019re going to achieve nothing.\u201d However, Ananian-Welsh said the list of criminal organisations proposed by Rau had already inadvertently captured the Phoenix motorcycle club, a harmless social riders group that shared the same name as a self-styled \u201coutlaw\u201d motorcycle club in New South Wales. This showed the unintended consequences of giving \u201cmassive discretion\u201d to governments and police, Ananian-Welsh said. \u201cUnder the law, if the Phoenix motorcycle club went, \u2018Oh crap, we\u2019ve just been declared a criminal organisation, let\u2019s dismantle it,\u2019 that wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d The laws would also be \u201ctotally useless\u201d against groups that didn\u2019t formally label themselves, such as the Calabrian mafia, \u201cunless the mafia all started wearing uniforms\u201d, she said. Ananian-Welsh said the South Australian government\u2019s position reflected the trend of governments \u201ccutting out the courts in an experiment with how broad we can make the government\u2019s power\u201d. \u201cYou see it in the proposed citizenship laws, the declared foreign places laws, metadata retention,\u201d she said. South Australia has not adopted Queensland\u2019s Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment (Vlad) Act, which Ananian-Welsh said enabled the extreme scenario of three teenagers buying recreational drugs to be jailed for an extra 15 years or more at the discretion of the police commissioner. Her study with Williams found that at no point was the effectiveness of measures first introduced to deal with suspected terrorists considered as a factor in their adoption to tackle organised crime, she said. Banning bikies from public gatherings, clubhouses and wearing clothing and logos in licensed venues in Queensland was \u201ccertainly pushing them out of the public eye, which is great for families on Broadbeach\u201d. \u201cBut is this actually helping organised crime? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Ananian-Welsh said. \u201cWhat it is doing is having a huge impact on civil liberties that potentially goes beyond bikie gangs. It\u2019d be nice to know whether that\u2019s having any commensurate impact on cutting crime because I just don\u2019t know that it is. \u201cMaybe the [Queensland] review will come down and say organised crime has been dismantled in the state. But until we\u2019ve actually got something like that and while they\u2019re still so controversial in Queensland, it seems really preemptive for South Australia to be jumping on the bandwagon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
