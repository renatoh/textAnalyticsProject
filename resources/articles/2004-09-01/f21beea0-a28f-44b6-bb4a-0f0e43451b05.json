But the message was clear: back-to-backs are history. Banned by building regulations formulated by housing reformers 100 years ago, and demolished by the thousands in the slum clearance schemes of the 1960s, the humble back-to-back is now only usually kept as a museum of how we used to live. But architects are seriously suggesting that they offer a good design model for the dense-packed cities of the future. Back-to-backs do not have a distinguished history. In the 18th and 19th centuries, mill and mine owners built mile upon mile of them to cram the maximum number of workers into the minimum space, at the lowest possible cost. Back-to-backs were built on either side of a spine wall running down the terrace, so the houses had no rear windows and no back gardens. Advocates of the design pointed out that the houses were very warm, as they had few outside walls. One campaigner even suggested that the poor didn't deserve backyards because they used them 'to deposit filth'. But the absence of a back yard meant there was nowhere to put the toilet either, so back-to-back terraces had communal toilet blocks at intervals, often with bedrooms directly above. These were unspeakably horrible and caused disease to spread like wildfire. So when Victorian social reformers began to agitate for better housing for the poor, the back-to-back was their number one target. Whole neighbourhoods were torn down in slum clearance programmes, though they continued to be built in Leeds up to 1909. The National Trust has created a 'living history' museum from the last back-to-backs in Birmingham, furnishing the houses exactly as they were in the 19th century. They are even listed Grade II, something that would be incomprehensible for the campaigners who fought to get rid of them. In Leeds, one of the few places where back-to-backs survive in any numbers, they are becoming popular again. Now fitted with electric light, central heating and indoor bathrooms, the drawbacks have disappeared, revealing them as compact, easy-to-run homes with many of the advantages of flats but their own street doors. Bill Greenwood of Halifax Property Services in Beeston says: 'Back-to-backs are good starter homes for some people. On the south side, in areas such as Beeston, Hunslett and Holbeck, you can buy one for under \u00a350,000. On the north side they can cost more than \u00a3120,000.' Back-to-backs are proving most popular with buy-to-let investors. 'We have had investors come in and fuel the market, doubling prices in the last two years,' Greenwood says. Simon Sterne at Dacre Son &amp; Hartley in West Park, Leeds says back-to-backs are ideal for students, having very small gardens (if any) but being located conveniently for the university and colleges. 'The demand for student lets is incredible in Headingly, Burley and Kirkstall,' he says. 'Parents buy them for their student offspring and let the other rooms out.' So back-to-backs have survived as popular houses, despite being banned by current building regulations. But architects are becoming interested in the back-to-back as a way of providing the housing density needed in cities while preserving the traditional street pattern. The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, George Ferguson, says: 'There is increasing interest in what the street can offer as an intense form of urban development. Back-to-backs got a bad name because of the dreadful open sewers and lack of facilities but they actually did give everybody their own front door and little patch of land.' Back-to-back houses can provide higher housing densities than tower blocks but without the problems of isolation and social exclusion that tower blocks can foster he says. Ferguson wants the building regulations to be relaxed to allow a greater variety of house types to be built and streetscapes to be more varied. Today's building regulations were drafted on a purely engineering basis, to ensure all rooms have enough air and light and the streets are wide enough for cars. Ferguson says technology now allows us to reintroduce traditional streetscapes without rebuilding slums. 'The time has come to break the rules that are preventing us building places that we find delightful, with narrower streets that we are allowed at present,' he says. 'We are plagued with a load of regulations that are outdated and prevent an awful lot of charm that we find in old places.' The result would be a revival in the community life that the close-packed street patterns of the east end of London, the mining villages of South Wales and the mill towns of the North did so much to engender, he believes. This is not to say that all future houses should be back-to-backs. 'I would be against reintroducing backto- backs leading to a monoculture,' he warns. 'The way forward is flexible housing regulations.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
