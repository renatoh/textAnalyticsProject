The cabinet minister said she would consider it as an option during a select committee hearing in comments that will delight Tory critics of the broadcaster. She raised the possibility in answer to a question from Julian Knight, the Conservative MP for Solihull, who asked her to consider scrapping the licence fee and suggested a subscription service as a possible policy for the party\u2019s election manifesto. \u201cI\u2019m open minded and I will have decisions and listen to evidence on all sides,\u201d she said, speaking to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. \u201cWhat I haven\u2019t seen is any evidence, either way, what a subscription-based system would do in terms of the revenue. \u201cThe licence fee last year raised \u00a33.7bn for the BBC. They obviously have other sources of income as well. So I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income.\u201d Sources in her department later suggested that it would not be a priority for Morgan and pointed out that the government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC until 2027 for the duration of the 11-year charter period. However, her comments will boost the hopes of some Tory MPs who dislike the BBC and have long been campaigning for an end to the universal \u00a3154.50-a-year licence fee. A subscription service like Netflix would mean people having to opt in to watch programmes on BBC channels and listen to its radio stations. The idea was recently raised by the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank, which was welcomed by Knight, who predicted: \u201cPersonally, I think the next licence fee will be the last.\u201d In the same hearing, Morgan said she would not intervene in the BBC\u2019s decision to abolish free TV licences for over-75s. She said she had \u201cno plans\u201d to review the BBC\u2019s television licence shake-up, after the broadcaster agreed in 2015 to fund the free licences given to those aged over 75. The BBC announced this year that only low-income households in receipt of pension credits would receive the benefit, meaning around 3.7 million elderly people will have to pay \u00a3154.50 a year in future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
