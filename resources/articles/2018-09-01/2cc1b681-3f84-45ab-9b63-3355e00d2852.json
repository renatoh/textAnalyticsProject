The environment secretary, a prominent Brexiter, has regularly made a similar case in private to MPs, urging them to back May to see through Britain\u2019s exit rather than risk an impasse in parliament or a general election. If the EU changed its rules to disadvantage Britain, he said, it would be up to parliament to \u201cchart this nation\u2019s destiny\u201d and potentially change the relationship, he said. His intervention came hours before his former cabinet colleague Boris Johnson launched yet another broadside against the plan, suggesting that ministers had been \u201ctaken in\u201d about the implications of the Irish backstop agreement in December. In that agreement, the UK government agreed if the EU was not satisfied with the arrangements for the border, Northern Ireland would be part of the EU customs union and large parts of its single market. Johnson said ministers had been told it was \u201conly hypothetical \u2026 We were taken in.\u201d Writing in the Telegraph, Johnson said the consequences would \u201camount to a change in Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional status without its people\u2019s consent \u2026 it is a monstrosity.\u201d To avoid a border down the Irish Sea, the UK has argued it must be a UK-wide backstop. \u201cThat is also the essence of the Chequers proposals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey mean that the UK will become a rules-taker not just in goods and agri-foods, but almost certainly in the environment and social policy and many other legislative areas. \u201cThe whole thing is a constitutional abomination, and if Chequers were adopted it would mean that for the first time since 1066 our leaders were deliberately acquiescing in foreign rule.\u201d Gove is among the more sceptical cabinet Brexiters who have been persuaded to back the prime minister\u2019s plans for a common rulebook on goods as part of the proposals brokered at the prime minister\u2019s country retreat in Chequers this summer, which led to Johnson\u2019s resignation. Others who have stayed in the cabinet but remain in doubt about the plans include the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, and the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom. On Sunday, Gove told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that \u201ca future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union. \u201cBut the Chequers approach is the right one for now because we have got to make sure that we respect that vote and take advantage of the opportunities of being outside the European Union.\u201d He is understood to have made a similar case to MPs repeatedly over the summer, admitting he had some discomfort with some terms of the deal but that it delivered on most key tenets of the referendum, including leaving the European court of justice and ending free movement. His public argument comes amid a charm offensive in which Brexit-backing MPs have been hosted in Downing Street by senior staff who have made the case for the prime minister\u2019s deal and warned them they risk a second referendum or general election if they vote down any agreement. Gove said the UK had shown flexibility and it was now time for the EU to show some willingness to compromise. \u201cI\u2019ve compromised,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been quite clear that some of the things that I argued for in the referendum passionately, as a result of Chequers, I have to qualify one or two of my views. I have to acknowledge the parliamentary arithmetic. I believe the critical thing is making sure we leave in good order with a deal which safeguards the referendum mandate.\u201d The Liberal Democrats\u2019 Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the comments were \u201chypocrisy and disloyalty\u201d from the cabinet minister. \u201cHe must be running out of daggers. First Cameron, then Boris, now May. If he gets his way, it\u2019ll be the country next.\u201d Conservative MPs who oppose the Chequers deal, including the former Brexit secretary, David Davis, are to ramp up public opposition in the coming weeks with a series of rallies. Davis will share a platform with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the hard Brexit European Research Group of MPs. Others who will speak at the rallies, organised by the pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, include the former Brexit minister David Jones, the former environment secretary Owen Paterson and the Labour MP Kate Hoey. The rallies will begin next Saturday in Bolton with Farage, Davis and Hoey, an event that organisers say has almost sold out. Other rallies will take place in Birmingham during the Conservative party conference and continue on to Torquay, Bournemouth, Gateshead and Harrogate. Richard Tice, the vice-chair of Leave Means Leave, said: \u201cLeave Means Leave will be travelling across the country to make the case that the prime minister should chuck the Chequers plan and save \u00a339bn. The cross-party nature of the campaign proves how important this battle is. Party politics has been put to one side to secure what is best for Britain\u2019s future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
