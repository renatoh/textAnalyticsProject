I only used it briefly at trade shows and a Sony dealer show, and with long term use might have found it a little inflexible. It was also too expensive, so I would never have bought one myself. Still, the basic ideas will live on, and could reach a larger market late this year when Tablet PCs running Windows XP start to appear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
