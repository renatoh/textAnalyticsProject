Nestled among the strip malls and tract homes, the palm trees and liquor stores, there is a more surprising sight. A friendly green sign tells you it is Fresh &amp; Easy, the name given to the latest enterprise from Britain's biggest and the world's third largest retailer, Tesco. The Fresh &amp; Easy Neighborhood Market in Hemet, officially opened yesterday, is part of Tesco's first assault on the US retail market. It is the vanguard of a strategy that will see six stores open by the end of the week, 50 by the end of the year, 120 by the end of February. Tesco intends to plough \u00a3250m a year into the US, in pursuit of what the company's critics call \"glocalisation\". To say it seems out of place here is an understatement. The people in the store - young Hispanic families and white retired people - seem more dazed even than the normal habitu\u00e9s of supermarket aisles. They stare blankly at the packaging with its tasteful coloured lettering. They look askance at the fish trapped in small plastic boxes set on crushed ice. They huddle around the individually wrapped croissants and the boxes of onion bhajis. This is not what they are used to, not in Hemet, not in the rest of southern California. \"It's all bagged up,\" says Linda Hiland, pausing by the muffins. \"We're not used to that.\" She has a few token purchases in her trolley. \"Wine, milk and munchies,\" she says with an apologetic laugh. \"And wholewheat pizza dough. I like that. I'll whip that up for the grandkids.\" Roger and Lili Price are loitering at the junction of the milk and wine sections. \"You have a lot of things that you can't get elsewhere,\" says Lili, offering up a box of white pomegranate tea from her trolley. Roger recently retired from a career in the grocery business, working for Ralphs and Food 4 Less, so he is a man who knows his potatoes. Can Fresh &amp; Easy make a go of it? \"I think so,\" he says. \"It's very well done. I like the way there are products from other countries. It may be competition with Trader Joe's but there's more here.\" \"I think the concept is going to be very positive,\" says another customer, Luke. \"The philosophy of making it easy, good pricing and no deals is right. I was surprised. I thought the format would have more to it. It's very simple, very basic.\" Brian is marvelling at the milk. He is not a shopper, he is a spy. \"This is amazing,\" he says. Brian works for a grocery chain and has crossed half a continent to check out the new competition. \"I've worked in grocery stores all my life and typically they have the fancy stuff on the walls. This is the bare bones but it's all here.\" He is particularly taken by the cleanliness. \"Because it's clean it looks fresh,\" he declares. \"It's clean. I mean, that's a British thing, right? That's what we'd expect.\" But the supermarket has met opposition. The competition has promised to respond and the scale of the ambition has attracted critics spurred by charges against the company in Britain. Its environmental claims have come under scrutiny, as has its voracious property strategy, its non-unionisation and its refusal to sign a community benefits agreement. \"Tesco is really remarkable at marketing,\" says Robert Gottlieb, director of the Urban &amp; Environmental Policy Institute at Occidental College and co-author of Shopping for a Market, a study of Tesco's entry into the US. \"Saying they're doing all these things, like building green buildings and opening in food deserts. Raising these issues is a good thing. But they're also raising the issue of broken promises.\" Time to check out. But there is no one at the till. Instead, customers are faced with the challenge of scanning the bar codes on the contents of their trolley. \"There will be no Twiglets here,\" Tim Mason, the head of Tesco's US operation, recently declared. Undaunted, the Guardian came away with a box of Fresh &amp; Easy English breakfast tea bags."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
