Wigan reached their 21 with a 72nd-minute drop goal from their outstanding captain Andy Farrell, which nudged them ahead for the first time in the second half, only for Sean Long to respond with a five-card trick of his own, improvising a one-pointer from acting half with fewer than three minutes remaining. But even with a famous victory snatched away from them, the Wigan supporters were clearly happier than the St Helens majority among the 15,964 who gathered in driving rain for the traditional Good Friday derby. \"Ultimately we'll take anything at this moment,\" said Wigan's coach Mike Gregory, who was under pressure after Sunday's defeat at Huddersfield but must now be safe in the game's least secure job, for a week at least. \"Saints are on the crest of a wave, and we're fighting. I thought the players were immense today.\" St Helens had every right to feel aggrieved at the try that took Wigan to 20-20, another example of the ever increasing leniency of video referees as David Campbell ruled that the tiniest of fingertips from Terry Newton represented full control of the ball. But even the Saints coach Ian Millward was not sufficiently riled to make a major issue of the decision, perhaps recognising the courage Wigan had shown in coming back from 14-2 behind. \"In the first half we completely dominated, but in the second we could have been a bit more clinical,\" said Millward, whose team remain unbeaten in eight league and cup matches but have fallen a point behind Leeds at the top of the table - and must now go to Bradford on Monday. Two tries from Lee Gilmour, formerly of Wigan, and one from the rapidly emerging Jon Wilkin had given Saints their 12-point cushion, but the Warriors cut the deficit to six points at half-time when Danny Sculthorpe's long pass allowed Kevin Brown to get outside his opposite number Jason Hooper and cross in the left corner. Danny Orr, who had his best game since joining Wigan from Castleford to justify Gregory's decision to switch him to scrum-half, then plucked a Newton pass off his ankles to slide between the posts, but within four minutes a wonderful pass from Paul Wellens laid on a try for Willie Talau to put Saints ahead again. There was still half an hour left when Newton's controversial try brought Wigan level, but for 23 minutes the old rivals remained deadlocked, an increasingly tense period that exploded when Newton and Wilkin exchanged punches at a ruck, attracting several more players to a melee. Newton and Wilkin were both sent to the sin-bin, but it is Dom Feaunati, one of Saints' winter signings from Samoan rugby union, who could be in the most trouble when the disciplinary authorities study a video of the brawl next week, after connecting with a couple of haymakers. Farrell was visibly, and understandably, furious. But 20 minutes later, after exchanging drop goals with Long, he shook hands warmly with Feaunati as the pair left the field. There is no room for grudges in this card school. St Helens: Wellens; Albert, Hooper, Talau, Feaunati; P Sculthorpe, Long; Fozzard, Cunningham, Edmondson, Joynt, Gilmour, Wilkin.
