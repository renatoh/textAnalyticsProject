There was no haze to be seen, every crystal in the rocky outcrops remained sharp and little tarns reflected white clouds and azure skies like shining mirror shards sunk in the grass. We had first clambered to the site of the old Drum House after leaving the car on top of Honister Pass. It was from here we began to descend towards that incomparable view of Buttermere's lakes hemmed in between their mountain walls. And then we were climbing once more on to the skyline far above the green fields of the dalehead. To be on the roof of Haystacks on such a day is to be among the gods. Taller still by hundreds of feet, the northern faces of Great Gable and Kirk Fell gazed down with a snow-clad Scafell Pike peeping out from in between. Pillar Rock \u2013 ghostly in the shade of its eponymous fell \u2013 made its presence felt across the deep tank of Ennerdale, while to the north-east Dalehead and Robinson stretched out like steeplechasers galloping in the sun. On such a day it was possible to marvel at every turn: the shiny beetle scudding on a pool, the perched anvil on its plinth set above tiny ponds, and the wild flower on a pocket-handkerchief lawn. On the summit rocks I realised that for once I had not followed the \"Climb the steepest; descend the easiest\" rule of thumb favoured by climbers, and now faced a seriously jarring descent. The descent from 1,900ft was an abrupt shock, down many steep and twisting boot-worn rock steps. But even this oversight could not put a damper on this kind of day which when it happens is one for the camera and diary, albeit in this case a Country one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
