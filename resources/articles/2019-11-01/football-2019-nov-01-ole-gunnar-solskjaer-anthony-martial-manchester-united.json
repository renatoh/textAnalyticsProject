Martial has four goals in seven appearances, either side of two months out with a hamstring injury. He can be perceived as not smiling often and his previous manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, was not always content with his attitude. Solskj\u00e6r said of the 23-year-old: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has had a long run of games as a No 9 since he played many years ago [here] as a boy. Now he is maturing. You have to be obsessed with scoring goals as a No 9 and he is looking more and more like a player who wants to score goals and not just show his tricks. \u201cFor me he has matured a lot in his behaviour on the training ground as well. I believe we will see the best of him in the next few years. He looks happier and seems happy. He is an infectious boy \u2013 his smile and sense of humour. You can see he is happy here and that rubs off on everyone and it\u2019s great to see.\u201d United are at Bournemouth for Saturday\u2019s early game, having won their past three away matches in a run of four in 10 days. Solskj\u00e6r thinks confidence is building: \u201cThe whole mood \u2013 it\u2019s miles better on the training ground. They encourage each other. It\u2019s nice to be a coach and a manager when you see them come out and wanting to do extras, so we are improving. \u201cThe group is more ready for tougher times and better times. It\u2019s a miles better group that we have now. The camaraderie, the attitude of the boys, the selflessness, the humility. We are getting closer to what we want to see every day \u2013 that culture, the performance in training, the way they prepare for games. We\u2019ve travelled together and seen each other a lot [and] they\u2019ve been disciplined.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r is waiting on the fitness of Harry Maguire, Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Marcus Rashford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
