Apple\u2019s results for the three months to the end of September show that its phone business keeps growing, up 16% to 39.2m, boosted by just two weeks of sales of the new iPhone 6 range. Even the venerable Mac computer business had a great time, up 21% to 5.5m to nudge bigger, less profitable rivals. It is also the end of the line for the iPod, the device that, in 2001, sparked Apple\u2019s revival. In future, its sales will be recorded as \u201cother\u201d, along with headphones or accessories. But with just under 400m sold in total, it has done its job \u2013 making Apple both fashionable and profitable. The iPad, though, has seen falling year-on-year sales for all nine months of this year, quite clearly because people who bought one already do not see a need yet to replace them; even 2011\u2019s iPad 2 will run the latest iOS 8 software, if creakily. Tablets took off after Apple\u2019s reboot of the category in 2010 and have already reached 40% of households. They are replacing TVs for many children. But unlike smartphones they do not break or need urgent replacement \u2013 and the average price has slumped as people buy the smaller \u201cmini\u201d versions, down from more than $600 (\u00a3370) in 2011 to $431 last quarter. But Apple will not be worried. Operating profits were up by 11% and revenues rose by 12%. It has the next quarter to look forward to, with iPhone 6 sales in China, where they are expected to be hugely popular, and people buying iPads as gifts. More importantly, the 5.5in iPhone 6 Plus is expected to be popular in Asia and, if people buy those, they generate more revenue and profit for Apple than an iPad. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared to cannibalise ourselves,\u201d one Apple executive said after the iPhone launch. \u201cAnd we think those iPhone buyers might end up buying an iPad, too.\u201d The iPad might be limping, but Apple doesn\u2019t have any problems to compare with its arch-rival, South Korea\u2019s Samsung. Earlier this month, it guided that its smartphone sales and prices have collapsed in the face of Chinese manufacturers at the low end, and Apple, LG and Sony at the high end. Samsung\u2019s electronics division forecast operating profits of about 4.1trn won (\u00a32.4bn) on revenues of 47trn won (\u00a327.2bn); Apple announced operating profits of $11.12bn (\u00a36.9bn) on revenues of $42.1bn. In other words, Apple, despite shipping fewer smartphones (39m against 79m), made very much more profit from them. Apple beat the Wall Street estimates handily, even though it has stopped lowballing its forecasts as it did in the Steve Jobs days. Clearly, it was the iPhone which helped. Chief executive Tim Cook said at the results announcement: \u201cWe are heading into the holidays with Apple\u2019s strongest product lineup ever. We are also incredibly excited about the Apple Watch and other great products and services in the pipeline for 2015.\u201d In fact, it is already ramping up another new facet. On Monday, there were crowds of people in California and the rest of the US turning up in stores and using their new iPhones to pay for goods. They were using Apple\u2019s latest addition to its services: Apple Pay, which uses the fingerprint reader on the phone to enable contactless payments via a software update issued the same day. Thousands of dollars were spent in a few hours. That might not sound like much except that, despite Google\u2019s Android offering the same facility for years, hardly anyone has used it. Many storekeepers were seeing such transactions for the first time. So while the iPad might not be setting the world on fire, Cook will not be worried. The new iPads can do Apple Pay online. IBM has a tieup to sell iPhones and iPads to businesses. China only just began buying iPhones. Other businesses come and go, but Apple just seems to keep getting bigger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
