On Friday the teachers\u2019 union joined the Australian Council of Trade Unions\u2019 call for Setka to resign, and the shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, suggested Labor may have to consider disaffiliating itself from the Victorian construction union if he refused to quit. Setka has insisted he will not step down as the Victorian secretary of the construction division of the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union, despite the ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, publicly calling on him to quit, citing his intention to plead guilty to charges of harassing a woman using a carriage service. Albanese told Channel Nine\u2019s Today that he will \u201ctake a resolution to [the] national executive to expel Mr Setka from the Labor party\u201d. \u201cHe has made a series of comments over a long period of time that has brought the Labor party and the labour movement into disrepute,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cHe will be expelled on July 5.\u201d But as far as his union position, Albanese recognised Setka was \u201celected secretary\u201d and instead called on him to step down on the basis that holding the office \u201cis not in the interests of the union movement as a whole\u201d. Albanese has cited a pattern of behaviour, including Setka\u2019s remarks in 2017 that he would make the children of construction regulators \u201cashamed\u201d of their parents, and alleged comments that Rosie Batty\u2019s advocacy had harmed men\u2019s rights. Setka has said claims he denigrated Batty are \u201cfabricated\u201d and that he admired the \u201ctireless\u201d work she had done. At a press conference earlier this week he said he was elected by union members and was beholden to them. \u201cIf people want to expel me out of the Labor party over false accusations and over things that I\u2019ve never said, well, then, so be it,\u201d he said. Despite both calling on Setka to go, Albanese and McManus are at cross-purposes about the Batty remarks, with McManus telling ABC TV on Thursday that she has spoken to others at the meeting and accepts Setka\u2019s version because the accounts are consistent. \u201cHe never said anything to denigrate Rosie Batty, he didn\u2019t in any way say the laws are worse for men,\u201d McManus said. \u201cIt\u2019s been reported in a particular way that\u2019s not correct.\u201d Setka\u2019s allies have seized on Albanese\u2019s interpretation of the comments as evidence that others in the meeting have stitched up Setka and the reference to Batty is being used as a pretext to drive him out. Despite the discrepancy in accounts, Setka\u2019s expulsion from the ALP is in little doubt, both because Albanese has shored up support for that position behind the scenes and because the harassment charge will be heard on 26 June \u2013 before the critical 5 July national executive meeting. But only the CFMMEU can remove Setka from elected office and a delegates meeting on Thursday backed the Victorian leader. McManus has relied on the moral authority of solidarity in the labour movement at large to urge Setka to go, claiming the view of the \u201cmajority\u201d of union members is with her. In a statement the Australian Education Union said it \u201cfully supports\u201d McManus\u2019s call for Setka to stand down, noting the importance of combating family and domestic violence. \u201cAs union leaders, we cannot condone any actions which do not accord with the values we uphold and we must call out any behaviours which cause damage to the union movement and our members.\u201d The AEU joins the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and the Community and Public Sector Union public branch in backing the ACTU, while United Voice and the Australian Services Union have also said Setka should resign if the reported allegations against him are correct. On Friday, Rowland told Sky News that \u201cfurther action should be considered\u201d against Setka, and suggestions Labor should disaffiliate from the Victorian construction division were \u201call legitimate questions to be considered\u201d if he refused to go. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese has resisted suggestions that Labor should disaffiliate from the CFMMEU, citing its \u201cimportant role in workplaces\u201d including ensuring occupational health and safety and that workers are properly paid. The Maritime Union Western Australian branch secretary, Chris Cain, told Guardian Australia he is \u201ctotally against\u201d the push to remove Setka \u201cespecially for the Rosie Batty nonsense\u201d. Cain maintains the leaked remarks about Batty were \u201cgarbage\u201d and part of a political push to remove Setka. \u201cHe cannot be removed from his position by Sally McManus or anyone else, only his members. As far as I\u2019m concerned he\u2019s going nowhere and good on him.\u201d Asked if the court matter may change the assessment, Cain said that McManus should \u201cnot be getting involved in a court matter, it\u2019s nothing to do with Sally McManus or anyone else\u201d. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Setka has acknowledged and supported Rosie Batty and done many, many things for domestic violence \u2026 in his own union.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
