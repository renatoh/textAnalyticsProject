For years his friend Ian had been dressing up as a Viking and bashing people over the head with a sword just for the love of it - until his girlfriend Sue suggested he go into business with the act. Sue started booking Ian to visit schools to do Viking days as part of the history curriculum. 'And you,' an enthusiastic Ian told Mike, 'should be Henry VIII. You're perfect for it.' Mike is 20st or thereabouts, 'a huge fat monster with a ginger beard' is how he puts it. To be honest, Mike didn't really fancy the idea. He was working as a computer operator in Taunton. OK, so he hated it, but he was a married man with a kid on the way. He couldn't chuck it all up in the air to become Henry VIII. Could he? Mike and Amanda had tried for a child ever since they'd been together. The first time Amanda miscarried. That was very hard - especially as she'd trained as a midwife and knew exactly what was going on. They told her she had polycystic ovarian syndrome and her chances of conceiving were extremely low. And when they tested Mike it turned out he wasn't firing on all cylinders. But they kept trying - and amazingly, Amanda became pregnant. And now his mate was trying to persuade him to give up a steady job and become a mock-Tudor monarch. Eventually they decided he should try it on his days off; Sue would do a school mailshot and organise the bookings. It was a risk. The costume alone cost him about \u00a34,000. It was made by a theatrical dressmaker using a Tudor pattern. A historical bootmaker on the Isle of Wight made the 'bear paw' shoes, and an armoury provided a replica dagger, based on one in a Holbein painting. The costume was so complicated, the first time he went out to a school near Saffron Walden he forgot his pantaloons and had to be very careful about giving the kids an eyeful of what was under Hal's skirt. These days he's got dressing up down to about 15 minutes. The kids always ask, 'Is it hot, wearing that stuff?' 'Yes,' he says, perspiring madly, 'it is, actually.' He didn't tell them at work. If he worked nights he'd usually end up with a couple of free weekdays to be Henry in. And he's always loved history. He read up on the Tudors. He tells the schoolchildren the facts he knows they'll find fascinating. Like how Henry never actually wiped his own bottom. To a child, that's fantastic. 'How many people did he kill?' they ask. Well, there's one estimate of 75,000, but how long is a piece of string? The other day he asked the kids: 'Can anybody tell me the name of what I'm wearing here?' One kid said, 'Is it a c-, c-, c-'Codpiece, willed Mike. Say codpiece. 'Cockpit?' Compared to sitting in front of a computer, being with schoolchildren was wonderful. Last June he was getting so much work it was becoming impossible to hold down both jobs. The sensible thing would have been to stay at the computer office, which paid much more. 'What do I do?' he asked Amanda. 'Go for it,' she told him. Now, usually three days a week, he's Henry VIII. That leaves him at least one day a week to spend alone with his toddler, James. His new life is wonderful. Mike never felt he could be as lucky as this. It's coming up to a year now. He's still wondering when someone is going to tap him on the shoulder and tell him it's over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
