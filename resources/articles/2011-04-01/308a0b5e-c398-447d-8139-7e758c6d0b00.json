Swindon Town, where he became manager on 3 March, were bottom of League One, six points below the dotted line with four games left. Only wins would do but, true to cautious form, he played a single striker at home against Notts County, fellow strugglers under even newer management in Martin \"Mad Dog\" Allen. Victory went 2-1 to the bold. Simmering anger boiled over. After 18 minutes Swindon led deservedly. Jon-Paul McGovern hooked a seemingly lost cause at the byline into the goalmouth for Matt Ritchie, not the lone striker, to score. Swindon reached the interval barely challenged. The first 10 minutes after it determined the outcome. Allen, never one to be passive, put on Alan Judge and Lee Hughes, forces of vision and power respectively. Between times, from McGovern's corner, Jonathan Douglas, captain and midfield driving force, crashed a 25-yard volley against County's bar. In that instant Swindon, still one up, wilted as if the fates were against them. It invited the turnaround that followed. Hart had already rejigged his defence. Now they fell deeper. While Allen was barking, Swindon's manager stood arms folded, except when he spread them wide in despair like a goose contemplating flight then thinking better of it. He was flapping over substitutions when a long shot by Judge curled into the far corner as Hughes's run distracted David Lucas in goal. \"You don't know what you're doing,\" chanted jabbing fans, mobbing behind the dugout. They looked to have a point. Eight minutes later, with five to go and still no proactive move from Hart, Scott Cuthbert dithered over pumping another ball forward and was dispossessed by Hughes, who rounded Lucas. It was two minutes earlier than his winner in November. The game, and to all intents the season, ended with one substitution unmade, two Swindon strikers on the bench. Judge might have come with black cap. As if those 90 minutes were not enough for Hart, he had another 90 with the chairman, Andrew Fitton, before emerging to answer the obvious first question with disarming aplomb: \"Discussing plans for next year,\" he said. Full marks for that, though he was otherwise as much on the defensive as he has been throughout his 10-match spell at the County Ground, which has yielded one win, five goals and a slide from 20th place. \"We ran out of legs and got a bit edgy,\" he said of Swindon's second-half decline, as if it had been beyond his control. \"It's going to be pretty difficult from hereon in.\" Not for nothing have they been called Moonrakers. Hereon in starts at Sheffield Wednesday today, a reminder of brighter days in the Premiership. Swindon got there in 1993 under Glenn Hoddle, conceded 100 goals and became the first Premier League side to sink to the fourth tier (in 2006). Barring miracles in the next fortnight, they will be able to share top-flight memories next season with Bradford. Commendably crowds still average 8,500, more than half that of 1993-94, and fifth largest in the division. Where has it all gone wrong? They had a rocky financial ride round the turn of the millennium, with two spells in administration, before Fitton's consortium took them into calmer waters in 2008. Last May they were at Wembley, losing to Millwall in the playoffs, but Danny Wilson found it stickier going this season. Billy Paynter (26 league goals last season) went to Leeds in the summer, Charlie Austin (19 last season, 12 this) to Burnley in January for a reported \u00a31.6m; he has made two starts there \u2013 gain for no one. In addition the strong central defender Gordon Greer moved to Brighton in July. This defeat made the home run of 12 without a win their worst since 1901-02. Or perhaps the trouble started with this season's change of colours. Sky Sports Football Yearbook records them as: \"Red shirts with white inserts, red shorts with white inserts, red stockings with shite inserts.\" Hart sees the future as \"a great chance to rebuild\", with 12 players' contracts up. \"I have a decision to make about whether I want to be part of it.\" Director of football might suit him. Allen (seven points out of nine for Barnet before walking out \u2013 six out of 12 with County) could even be manager, though Paul Bodin, legendary defender, now Under-18s manager, would be safer. But for the moment the hymn comes to mind: \"As pants the hart for cooling streams, when heated in the chase.\" There are surely some in Morecambe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
