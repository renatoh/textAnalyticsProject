The uncapped Stockdale told Capello and the England general manager, Franco Baldini, on Monday that he was due to tie the knot 24 hours before the key match against the Swiss. The 25-year-old, an unused substitute in the friendly victory in Denmark in February, had insisted he would still be willing to return to the squad after the ceremony, so keen was he to be involved with the national set-up. However, the England management staff's response was that it would be unfair to ask him to link up again for the game, for which he was only likely to be third-choice and, therefore, not even on the substitutes' bench. While Joe Hart remains England's undoubted No1, Stockdale's withdrawal had still left Capello's options slim among the under-studies, with the previous No2 Ben Foster having announced he is taking a sabbatical from the international set-up, citing \"niggling injuries\" and a desire to prolong his club career. Green, who was first-choice a year ago but who has not featured for England since his high-profile error in the opening World Cup game against the USA in Rustenburg, had indicated after the friendly against Ghana in March that he would not be available for the June qualifier, with his partner due to give birth at the end of May. The England staff had apparently been minded not to select the West Ham United goalkeeper for the Switzerland game anyway following the trauma of suffering relegation to the Championship with his club side. They did contact the 30-year-old over the weekend to gauge his thinking and were informed he would talk over the issue with his family, having become a father last week. There had been no further contact until Tuesday, when he expressed a willingness to join up with the squad if required. Capello was happy to accept him back into the fold, meaning he \u2013 along with Scott Carson of West Bromwich Albion \u2013 will complete the national side's complement of goalkeepers for the Switzerland game. Stockdale's inclusion had arguably reflected the paucity of options available to England, having only made 10 appearances at Fulham this season, the last of which came in a 4-0 FA Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur at the end of January. The Australian veteran Mark Schwarzer remains the first-choice goalkeeper at Craven Cottage, limiting Stockdale's impact, and the former Darlington player is now left to wait for his chance at the higher level."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
