SpaceX is working on a vehicle that will take humans to Mars, a 100-metre ship codenamed the BFR (Big Fucking Rocket). But building a colony would require \u201ctremendous entrepreneurial resources\u201d, Musk said. He also countered the suggestion that Mars might be \u201csome escape hatch for rich people\u201d by highlighting the risks of the mission: \u201cIt will be like Shackleton\u2019s ad for Antarctic explorers: \u2018Difficult, dangerous, a good chance you\u2019ll die, excitement for those who survive.\u2019 That kind of thing. \u201cThere\u2019s not many people who will want to go in the beginning,\u201d he said, adding that over time the Red Planet colony would be hospitable and have \u201cgreat bars. The Mars bar! I love dad jokes, I\u2019m a dad!\u201d The BFR will fly for the first time in the first half of 2019, Musk said, acknowledging that his \u201ctimelines historically have been optimistic\u201d. The production of the Tesla Model 3 electric car, for example, has been plagued by delays. Musk said he initially gave SpaceX and Tesla a likelihood of success of just 10%. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let my friends invest because I didn\u2019t want them to lose their money,\u201d he said of SpaceX. Instead he funnelled his own money, from the sale of PayPal, into the businesses. \u201cSpaceX is alive by the skin of its teeth. So is Tesla. If things had gone a little bit the other way, both companies would be dead.\u201d Musk said he was now kept awake at night by the threat posed by unregulated artificial intelligence, which he has previously warned could lead humanity into a third world war \u2013 another the reason to go to Mars. \u201cMark my words,\u201d he said, \u201cAI is much more dangerous than nukes. So why do we have no regulatory oversight?\u201d He suggested a public regulatory body would need \u201cinsight and oversight\u201d to confirm that everyone was developing AI safely and in a way that is \u201csymbiotic with humanity\u201d. However, even coming up with the safety parameters would present all sorts of insidious and unexpected risks, Musk said. If the utility function of artificial intelligence is to maximise happiness of humans, a super-intelligent AI might decide that the best way to do that is to capture all humans and inject their brains with dopamine and serotonin. Musk proposed that digital intelligence should instead be directed to maximise \u201cthe freedom of action of humanity\u201d. The Q&amp;A session ended on a surreal note as Musk, his younger brother Kimbal and Nolan all donned stetsons and sang a snippet of My Little Buttercup, a song from the 1986 movie The Three Amigos. \u201cThis is going to be real bad,\u201d warned Musk. He was right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
