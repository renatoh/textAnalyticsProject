Debating the future of higher education at the Guardian's HE summit, speakers from throughout the sector predicted greater flexibility in the way universities offer courses in order to respond to the need for a more highly skilled workforce and greater global competition by 2020. Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, said that it was important the sector maintained the values inherent in a liberal democracy, such as freedom of speech, freedom to challenge and debate other people's opinions and freedom of thought. But he said while these values should remain stable, the ways they were delivered would have to change. He said these changes would need to happen in five key areas: access, links between schools and universities, the supply of higher level skills to employers, involvement of students in the way they access learning, and ensuring that more home students get the chance to experience a foreign country. \"Some people think of HE as an inherently conservative activity,\" he told delegates. \"But radical change can and does happen.\" Geoffrey Crossick, warden of Goldsmith's University of London and a member of the chair's advisory group for the 1994 Group of smaller research-led universities, said the path to 2020 would be a bumpy ride. While the classic idea of an 18-year-old student living away from home would persist, he said there would be huge diversity in how and where both full and part-time courses were delivered. This is not only because of changing demographics - which means there will be fewer 18-year-olds - but because the current model of funding for teaching and learning is \"unsustainable\". This will mean universities increasingly being funded through a mixture of public and private funding. Crossick suggested the Higher Education Funding Council for England may not even exist by 2020. He said that if that happens universities would realise what a stabilising influence it was, and that \"managing risk [would] become a priority for most universities\". Richard Brown, chief executive of the Council for Industry and Higher Education, said if the number of people in the workforce with higher education experience was to increase from 29% to 40%, it would have profound implications. \"We will be looking for new products in new markets, delivered by new types of staff,\" he said. He added that it would also involve bite-sized learning, with coherent qualifications systems across further and higher education. But Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of larger research-led universities, said while there were huge challenges facing universities over the next few years, it was a case of sustaining a success story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
