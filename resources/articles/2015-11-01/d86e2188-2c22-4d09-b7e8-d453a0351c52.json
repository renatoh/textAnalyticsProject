Ancelotti left Chelsea in 2011, after the final match of the season at Everton \u2013 where he was told of his departure in the tunnel at Goodison Park, just a year after leading the side to the Double. However, the Italian, who has since managed Real Madrid and PSG, holds no grudges over the manner of his own dismissal. \u201cI would have no problem with Chelsea,\u201d he told the Daily Mail when asked if he would return to Stamford Bridge. \u201cBut Jos\u00e9 won\u2019t be sacked. They already choose to keep him, and I think they made a good choice.\u201d Ancelotti, who won Real\u2019s 10th Champions League title while in Spain, also revealed he is keen on a return to English football, but insisted he was not approached about the Liverpool job before J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s appointment. \u201cI would like to come back to work in England,\u2019 he said. \u201cI love the football here, I still have a house in London, and I would like to be with a team that is competitive in England and in Europe. \u201cI think Liverpool are a good team \u2026 But I did not speak with them. If I spoke with them I can say \u2018yes\u2019, but no, I did not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
