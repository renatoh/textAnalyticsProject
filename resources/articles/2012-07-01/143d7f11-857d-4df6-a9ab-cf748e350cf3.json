The research from risk analysis firm Maplecroft warned that the UK's high level of interaction with, and dependence on, eurozone countries, alongside its own struggling domestic economy, meant it was most at risk from Europe's economic woes of 169 nations studied in a eurozone exposure index (EEI). Maplecroft said the UK's strong trade and banking links with the eurozone were a potential source of weakness, adding that the UK's big budget deficit meant there was limited scope to ease policy in the event of a deepening sovereign debt crisis. Although the list of 17 countries labelled \"extreme risk\" included Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Mozambique and Sweden, the study said Britain topped the table by virtue of its close integration with the eurozone. Around 50% of the UK's trade is conducted with countries within the eurozone, and a collapse of strategic euro countries such as Spain and Italy could prompt a 7% drop in UK trade and result in losses of around \u00a395bn in Britain's banking sector. Other factors cited by the study were the UK's exposure to \u00a3380bn in European banks and sovereign bonds, together with foreign direct investment (FDI) from the eurozone, accounting respectively for 27% and 20% of national GDP. The UK's ranking also reflected international concerns regarding the resilience of Britain's own economy. A large national fiscal deficit of approximately 8% of GDP and a net public debt representing over 80% of GDP were flagged up as weaknesses which would severely limit the UK's capacity for a fiscal response to eurozone crises. Maplecroft said action should be taken to limit the exposure of \"extreme risk\" countries. \"Both economies and business may seek to manage this risk by diversifying trading patterns to account for lower demand, either in third countries or by concentrating on domestic markets,\" said analyst Mandy Kirby. \"Short-term policies that seek to defend local economies could result in new controls on business operations or additional business costs.\" Eastern European countries also featured heavily in the EEI with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic occupying the next three rankings. Poland, however, was judged more likely than the UK to be able to improve its resilience to eurozone exposure in the long-term., with measures such as raising the retirement age to 67, and introducing a permanent fiscal rule to reduce fiscal deficit regarded as effective buffers to external crisis. African nations were also prominent, with Mauritania occupying fifth place, Mozambique sixth, Mauritius seventh and Morocco twelfth. Their high levels of exposure were the result of heavy reliance on the eurozone for trade. Almost 60%of Mozambique's total fuel and mining exports, and 30% of the Ivory Coast's agricultural products are reliant on European consumption."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
