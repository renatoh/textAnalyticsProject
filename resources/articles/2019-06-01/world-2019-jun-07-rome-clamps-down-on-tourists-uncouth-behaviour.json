Authorities in the Italian capital have now enforced a slew of rules, updated from legislation drafted in 1946, as they seek to clamp down on uncouth behaviour that has long been a source of frustration. One of the measures is a permanent ban on modern-day centurions \u2013 men who dress up in tunics and leather breastplates, wielding plastic swords \u2013 and make money by posing for photos. Sanz is not a centurion \u2013 he is in Rome with a group of friends for his stag do \u2013 but he might be mistaken for one. \u201cWe just dressed up like this for fun,\u201d he said. \u201cSo long as I don\u2019t make a disturbance, I guess I\u2019ll be OK. The bad thing would be to get drunk while dressed like this. I can understand such rules and I\u2019m glad to know about them now.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t just Sanz. The Trevi Fountain area was full of people unwittingly committing transgressions, particularly those flouting the ban on \u201cmessy\u201d eating near monuments. \u201cThis is against the law now?\u201d asked Giuseppe, a visitor from central Italy, as he tucked into pizza while standing by a church opposite the fountain. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s a good thing. They have a similar law in Venice. You shouldn\u2019t be eating by monuments and making a mess.\u201d Clara Jankovitch, a tourist from Hungary, was perched on the steps of the church enjoying an ice-cream. \u201cI can understand pizza and sandwiches, but surely an ice-cream is OK? Look around, everyone is eating one,\u201d she said. It is unclear whether people will be served a penalty for such infractions or simply get a ticking off from the tourist police patrolling historic sites, but Rome authorities have promised \u201csevere fines\u201d for those caught taking a dip in the city\u2019s fountains \u2013 a frequent occurrence during the summer. Other rules include bans on wheeled suitcases and buggies being dragged down historic staircases, walking around bare-chested, and pub crawls. The authorities are also taking aim at \u201cnuisance drunks\u201d or people who sing on public transport, as well as those who wrap their mouths around the nozzles of the city\u2019s drinking fountains. Illegal street trading and ticket touting outside tourist sights have also been banned, as has the Roman custom of hanging laundry out to dry between neighbouring buildings. \u201cOld regulations have been updated to adapt to the needs of a modern society,\u201d said Marco Cardilli, deputy chief of staff and security delegate at Rome\u2019s council."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
