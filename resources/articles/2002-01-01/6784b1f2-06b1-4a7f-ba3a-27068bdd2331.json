That colourful, cockle-warming herald of springtime, the Six Nations rugby championship, sounds its trumpet overtures once again this weekend. Some compelling theatre can be guaranteed. The show runs till Sunday April 7 and a finale that, this time, has the white-shirted English battering on the gates of Rome itself. Meanwhile, as a tasty aperitivo for the real thing, the beguiling play Alone It Stands still has two weeks to run in London's West End and those unable to travel this weekend for the opening salvoes in Paris, Edinburgh or Dublin could do far worse than form an orderly queue at the Duchess Theatre turnstiles to enjoy a relishable tang of rugby's cultural craic . Alone It Stands is an engagingly irrepressible ensemble piece, in turn as sharp as a dart and as romantically mushy as peas. Without props or costume changes, six invigorating actors play more than 60 parts in a whoopee of Celtic gusto that celebrates one of all rugby's imperishable legends - October 31 1978 when the Reds sank the Blacks and the leprechauns of Munster beat the Goliaths of New Zealand 12-0 at Thomond Park to light up the old grey city of Limerick and far beyond. Save for a single, fuzzily wobbling hand-held camera at ground level, the match was not televised because all RTE's outside-broadcast units had been assembled down in Cork for the grand launch of the channel's second station RTE2 at a gala show in the Opera House. The presumption was, as well, that the All Blacks against Munster would be such a cruel public execution that it would be merciful not to record it on camera. No Irish rugby team in all history had ever beaten the New Zealanders - and this particular lot, led by true-great Graham Mourie, were odds-on to beat all four British Isles countries in the Tests, which they did - and, anyway, hadn't the Munster XV, in a masochistic form of practice, just got back from London where they had been drubbed by 39-3 (\"and lucky to get three, lads\") by a scratch Middlesex county side? In the event, as the world and his wife soon knew, by far the most raucous and ravishing opera took place that day at Limerick's Thomond Park - \"where even the earth-worrums in the mud joined in the chorus\". And now, 34 years on in London, there is this dramatic and diverting ceilidh by John Breen to prove it - at 40 minutes each way and leaving you pleading for extra-time encores - from the re-enactment of Seamus Dennison's opening crash tackle on Stu Wilson to the defiance of those unforgettable final minutes in the gloaming: \"Was that a tactical fart I can smell in here, me boys?\" We all revel in sport as theatre. How warming to enjoy it, for once, the other way round."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
