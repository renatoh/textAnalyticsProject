Lewis had some encouraging moments in the opening stages but Taylor soon found his rhythm and never let up as he rolled to a 5-0 victory. Lewis was being swept aside as Taylor, right, won leg after leg to race to a 4-0 lead. He then managed to win the first leg of the fifth set but Taylor quickly levelled matters. In a tense third leg Taylor hit a maximum but Lewis hit back with one of his own and went on to a 2-1 lead. When Taylor tied at 2-2 Lewis looked like a man who knew the game was up. He still managed a maximum but Taylor did not break sweat as he responded with a 100 and then a maximum of his own before finishing the job with a double eight. \"I thought there was a lot of pressure on Adrian, to be fair,\" Taylor said. \"It's OK getting past the first and second round but then you've got to perform. \"But you can start to play your proper darts now and that's what I did. \"He was fantastic but I just didn't give him a chance really. I was focused, I wasn't nervous. I was a bit excited about the game. I'm here to win the world championships, I really am up for this.\" He now plays Mark Webster, who continued his excellent run with a 5-3 win over Co Stompe. Webster raced into a 4-0 lead before Stompe fought back to 4-3. But the Welshman Webster finished the job in the eighth set. The other semi-final is between Raymond van Barneveld and the Australian Simon Whitlock, the star of the earlier matches as he knocked out James Wade 5-3 in an outstanding battle. He hit 15 maximums and recorded an average of 105.37 as he saw off Wade. \"That's probably the hardest match I've ever played in,\" Whitlock said. \"I was really focused and knew I had to play at my best.\" The Dutchman Van Barneveld beat Robbie Baxter 5-0, his third straight-sets victory of the tournament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
