But there may not, in view of the events of the past four days, be many more to come. The 41-year-old Welshman, who has represented his country in the World Cup eight times and has won twice on tour, took \u00a3228,000 in prize money in 2001 but played so poorly this season that he is back at qualifying school. Furthermore, although he made the four-round cut yesterday, he did so in joint 49th place, well outside the 35 and ties who will ultimately earn places on the tour next year. Mouland is seven under on 279, 14 shots behind the leader Philip Archer who, on 265, is two ahead of Philip Golding and setting a rare pace. Altogether there are 27 players who are in double digits under par and they will form the nucleus of the eventual card winners. The first four rounds were shared between the Pals and Emporda clubs here in northern Spain, but the final two rounds will be played at the latter course. Mouland will need some of his best play over the next 36 holes if he is to retain his playing privileges. Should it not materialise, he is in a quandary. He will go from the European tour, with its prize-money total of \u00a360m, to the Challenge tour, which offers about \u00a33.5m. A good living is possible from the former, impossible from the latter. He is also likely to lose his sponsors - Mizuno for his clubs and Kartel for his clothes - because of clauses demanding European tour exposure. \"I'm a married man with a wife and two children,\" he said yesterday. \"If I fail here I'll play the Challenge tour and try and get back to the main tour.\" But there are only 15 places available every year for that particular promotion and no certainty of getting one. So what if? \"It's pen-to-paper time,\" said Mouland, who would be just one of many writing to sponsors to ask for an invitation. \"I've played in a lot of tournaments so I would hope the sponsors recognise the name and the effort I've put in. The trouble is they tend to invite the kids first these days.\" Best, then, to do a couple of 67s in the next two rounds? \"That should do it,\" said Mouland. \"That should prevent a lot of problems.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
