The marine department has written to the duke, whose family owns Lismore Castle, County Waterford, asking him to remove the barrier on a stretch of the Blackwater river he owns to allow more salmon and lampreys to migrate upstream. The weir is upriver at Careysville in County Cork. Michael Penruddock, the estate manager, said the salmon and lampreys could pass up the weir and its removal would destroy a valuable spawning ground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
