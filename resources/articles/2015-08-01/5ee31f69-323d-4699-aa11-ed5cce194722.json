One friend asked Labrie in a message how he had gone from \u201cno to bone\u201d last year with the 15-year-old freshman who had first rejected Labrie\u2019s invitation. \u201cUsed every trick in the book,\u201d Labrie replied, according to a message shown to the jury in a packed Concord, New Hampshire, courtroom where Labrie is facing charges of aggravated sexual assault and child endangerment. Now in its second week, the trial has cast a spotlight on the culture at the elite St Paul\u2019s school, where annual tuition exceeds $50,000 and alumni include the secretary of state, John Kerry. The alleged victim, now 16, sat in a front row next to her father, who is a corporate executive at a major global investment firm. Her father often had his arm wrapped around her and she appeared to weep at times. Labrie\u2019s defense attorney JW Carney Jr has said Labrie, 19, who attended the school on a scholarship, never sexually penetrated the girl when they were making out after she agreed to accept his invitation known as a \u201csenior salute\u201d. Testing on the girl\u2019s underwear did not confirm the presence of Labrie\u2019s semen. However, his DNA was found, according to prosecutors. During questioning, Carney implied Labrie was prone to exaggerating and being provocative to entertain his friends. He called Labrie\u2019s statements \u201ctypical juvenile\u201d talk. Labrie\u2019s friend Tucker Marchese testified that Labrie\u2019s communications were often \u201ccreative and whimsical\u201d. \u201cWelcome to an eight-week exercise in debauchery \u2026 probing the inner most meaning of the word sleaze bag \u2026 Frog\u2019s milk complimentary,\u201d Labrie wrote to Marchese asking him to help create a list of girls they would like to \u201csalute\u201d before graduating. The victim\u2019s name appeared on the list in capital letters. Last week the girl spent more than seven hours on the witness stand over three days, giving graphic descriptions of a painful assault. She said she allowed Labrie to take off her pants but not her underwear and froze as he went around her underwear, performed oral sex and penetrated her. She tearfully testified she was sexually inexperienced and was so confused and shocked, she did not scream or try to escape. She told her mother about the encounter several days later and a school counselor called police. Another student at the school who coaxed her to agree to meet with Labrie testified today that Labrie asked him to \u201cput in a good word\u201d so the girl would meet him. The boy, who will be a junior at the school this year, told the jury a group of boys later crowded into a room with Labrie after rumors swirled he had sex with the girl. Asked if the rumors were true, Labrie said, \u201cNo,\u201d while nodding yes. and smirking, the boy said. He testified Labrie later told him he had sex with the girl. \u201cI asked him in a pretty serious manner if he had sex with her, and he told me he did,\u201d said the boy. Labrie\u2019s roommate at the school Andrew Thomson, who is now a student at Brown University, testified he warned him the girl was too young. \u201cI told him it probably was not a good idea,\u201d Thomson told the jury. Later Labrie told his roommate he had \u201cboned her\u201d, Thomson said. He assumed Labrie meant they had sex \u201cbut in that context it can mean other things\u201d, he said. Thomson denied claims he and Labrie were having a contest who could accumulate the most \u201csenior salutes\u201d. Another friend, Malcolm Salovaara, who was attending alumni events when the girl says she was assaulted, testified Labrie told him he was \u201cslaying\u201d her. \u201cIt could have meant anything from they kissed to they had sex,\u201d said Salovaara, who now attends Dartmouth University. Labrie, Thomson and Salovaara, had a Facebook group they called \u201cSlayers Anonymous\u201d, which they used to keep in touch. According to testimony, students at the school rubbed for luck the names of alumni carved into a display outside a dining hall at the school. Students usually rubbed names of relatives. Labrie liked to rub the name of a man from the Class of 1947 whose last name was \u201cSlaymaker\u201d. As rumors about Labrie and the young girl spread, her friends confronted Labrie. He wrote a message to Marchese predicting the \u201cthing will blow over\u201d. \u201cDeny until I die tonight,\u201d Labrie wrote, in a message shown to the jury. Salovaara testified the phrase, \u201cDeny until I die\u201d was common among some on campus \u201cas a way of getting out of trouble\u201d. Labrie, who had been accepted at Harvard until his arrest last year, will testify in his own defense, Carney has told the jury. While awaiting trial, Labrie has spent the last year building a chapel in Vermont, his attorney said outside the courthouse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
