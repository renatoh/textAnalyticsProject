Last year, more like", "bodyText": "A BA flight to Edinburgh I booked in January 2003 via Lastminute.com was cancelled. BA confirmed this in writing and told me to claim from Lastminute. After 14 months, 15 emails, two letters, contact with nine people and five refund refer ence numbers, I have failed to get my money back. Lastminute blames red tape and delays at BA, but BA says it has all been resolved. I cannot break though Lastminute's tortuous system. IW, London It shouldn't take this long, admits Lastminute. The refund from BA did not arrive until the end of last year but it cannot explain why passing the money over took another four months. The cost of the two seats has now been sent to you with \u00a3100 compensation. Rediscovered refund Last November, I paid \u00a3134 to the Probate Office for letters of administration. The Probate Office banked my cheque before realising that it couldn't handle my case and said it would post a refund. Nothing had arrived by the end of January but the Probate Office said the refund had been cashed on 2 December at Barclays bank. I took my Barclays bank statement into the Probate Office to prove I hadn't received the money and they promised to send another cheque. Nothing has arrived. MW, Hampton Hill The problem was handled for the Probate Office by Liberata, a company that provides back-office services. After lengthy discussions, Barclays persuaded Liberata to send you a cheque, which you immediately cashed. As you were adamant that you had not received the original cheque, Barclays' fraud department investigated. The cheque was finally traced to your Woolwich Open Plan account (Barclays owns the Woolwich) where it had been showing on your statement since December. You will have to return the replacement cheque to Liberata. Only child's guide to inheritance I am an only child with ageing parents who own their home outright and have other moderate savings. My relationship with them is non-existent. I am not mercenary but wonder what will become of their assets when both have passed over. Would I be a beneficiary irrespective of their wishes or could they disinherit me? PP, Leicester Through wills, your parents can leave their assets to whoever they choose. As you are not financially dependent on them, you cannot challenge a valid will that leaves you nothing. But, if one died without making a will, the surviving spouse would get the personal belongings, the first \u00a3125,000 of the estate including investments and property, and a life interest in half of what was left. You would receive the other half, as you are over 18, and the remainder when the surviving parent died. If your second parent also died intestate, you'd get everything. Attitude problem over endowment I left my husband in 1989 and two years later bought a house. The broker recommended a Scottish Amicable endowment policy. I am not a risk-taker and would not have agreed to an endowment if I had known there was even a slight risk. I have since sold the house but continued the endowment as savings until I found the value going backwards. In September 2000, I complained of mis-selling and six months later they rejected my claim. Last year the Pru, which owns Scottish Amicable, asked about my attitude to the policy and this time offered \u00a31,474 compensation because it now took 'attitude to risk' into account. LB, Plymouth It is a nonsense for the Pru to say it did not take account of your attitude to risk when investigating your first complaint. It certainly should have done. The company has now offered you \u00a3572 on top of \u00a31,474, for the difference between the premiums you have paid since 2001 and today's surrender value. It is adding \u00a3150 compensation. Cigar fee up in smoke I am a 23-year-old cellist studying at the Royal College of Music. Last October I was employed by Lothbury Group Private Client Management to play Bach cello suites for a cognac- and cigar-tasting event at the Mo\u00ebt Hennessy headquarters. I have still not been paid the promised \u00a3122. GS, London This outfit also owes money to Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, which has given up trying to chase the debt. Lothbury is an events organiser which, despite its City-sounding name, has nothing to do with financial services, so you have no recourse through that well-regulated industry. I could not get a response from the mobile phone number either so the only avenue left is the small claims court if you feel the effort is worthwhile. \u00b7 Email Margaret Dibben at money.writes@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.
