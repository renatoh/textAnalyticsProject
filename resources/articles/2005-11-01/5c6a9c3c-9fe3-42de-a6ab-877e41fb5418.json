Reading this I felt a cocktail of familiar feelings: anger that half a million children could be living in such conditions, relief that mine aren't, and a strong sense of \"so what are you going to do about it?\" Is teaching children about poverty part of a parent's job? I've always thought so, though I also know that it's treacherous territory. Tread too clumsily and you will be accused of indoctrination. (Indoctrination, of course, is always what somebody else does. It's usually conjugated like this: you/he/she/it indoctrinates, I/we are simply opening their eyes.) Myself, I was shameless: my children were barely out of nappies before I started propagandising. I swear they knew the difference between TV commercials and programmes before they could read. They received theories about surplus value literally along with their mother's milk. They had a decent grounding in the causes of social inequality before they could brush their own teeth. Sometimes I feel like a one-person (or, with their father, two-person) but-think-of-the-environment party pooper. Do I worry about this? Frankly, no: only certain kinds of views are ever labelled doctrinaire, they've got the whole of the rest of the culture to indoctrinate them the other way - and anyway, by the time they reach teenagehood, most kids don't need any lessons in challenging their parents' views. I do worry, though, about inducing guilt (an entirely counter-productive emotion, because feeling guilty about something usually stops you from engaging with it at all), or leaving them with the idea that dropping a few coins into a collecting-box absolves them of the need to do anything else to change the world. For yes, I confess: I believe part of my job is to raise children who in some way or other are committed to improving the world and not just their place in it. But how? Children are sensitive Geiger counters for any mismatch between what is and what ought to be: they can recognise at two paces a \"Do as I say, not as I shop.\" I fear I've passed on to my daughters the shopping gene even if, by budget and belief, I'm more Primark than Prada. We're all implicated in poverty, though I admire those parents whose lives are less full of contradictions than mine, parents so unmaterialistic that they never experience a war between their wants and their needs, who produce kids ready to give up their pocket-money to every good cause (my children want me to give up mine instead). While I fret that anything I can do about poverty is infinitesimally tiny, I also don't want to induce in my kids an over-inflated sense of their own power. It's all very well trying to get them to feel that they can make a difference, but what if they can't? What if I unleash a Live 8-type sense of hope that's just waiting to be dashed by greedy corporations and cynical politicians? I've tried looking at how other people resolve these dilemmas. On the internet almost all of them are Christian and American - a lethal combination. They suggest things such as \"Serve at your local homeless shelter and bring your child!\" \"Have your child choose a 'pen pal' [in poverty] in another country!\" Or then there's \"Kids! You have the power to be part of hopeful solutions to some very tough global problems!\" As I see it, all those exclamation marks have made the world a worse place! And they patronise children too! And anyone for \"Share current world poverty statistics with your child ... Have a family discussion about the facts of children in poverty\"? I admit that I've tried announcing brightly, as we sit down to dinner, \"we're going to have a quiz: how many people in the world do you think have computers?\" (answer: only 10% even have access to one), but I'm usually shouted down because they want to watch The Simpsons. In the end, perhaps the most I can do is encourage in my kids a sense of gratitude for all that they have, and an awareness of what others lack. And if we can sustain that for the next 50 shopping days, then I do believe in Santa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
