The Warriors played the final 20 minutes with 14 men after Tom Wood received his second yellow card and it is five months since their last league victory. Leeds's victory at Sale the previous night had left Worcester one point off the bottom. The Warriors had not won any of their previous nine Premiership matches, drawing four, and while Bath's home form in the league had been dismal, the return of the fly-half Butch James from injury had provided a belated stimulus. James quickly adopted his favoured high-risk strategy, flicking passes inside and out and testing Worcester's defence with teasing kicks, but it was the wing Joe Maddock who proved the difference in the opening. Maddock failed to score a try in his first 12 appearances this season but he followed his pair at London Irish last Sunday with two in six minutes after Worcester had taken the lead. The Warriors look like signing the England outside-half Andy Goode next season, ending what seems a perennial search for a playmaker. Willie Walker has filled the position for most of the season having initially signed on loan from Gloucester last season but he has never looked more than a stop-gap. He scored the opening try after opting to kick a penalty to touch. Worcester twice drove to the line before Walker received the ball under the posts and eluded the tackles of Michael Claassens and Lee Mears. Bath were stung into an instant response. They took play through five phases before launching a move from left to right. James was involved twice, at one point setting his sights on the right-hand corner before conceding that he did not have the legs and flicking out a pass to Maddock. Walker extended Worcester's lead with a long-range penalty but Bath were ahead two minutes later when Stuart Hooper won a lineout on the Warriors' 22 and James flicked an inside pass to Maddock who wrong-footed Chris Latham on his way to touching down under the posts. A Ryan Davis penalty gave Bath a 15-10 interval lead and Worcester went into the break a man short after the side with the worst yellow card record in the Premiership this season lost the flanker Tom Wood to the sin bin for using his hands in a ruck. The game suffered when James left the field with a shoulder injury on 48 minutes after a collision with Craig Gillies. He was replaced by Olly Barkley, who was making his first appearance of the season after breaking his leg last August, with David moving from centre to fly-half. Davis and Walker exchanged penalties before Worcester self-destructed. First, Latham was sent to the sin bin for obstructing Maddock after the wing had chipped to the line than Wood received his second yellow card after intervening in a dispute between Greg Rawlinson and Peter Short. Worcester were down to 13 men when Michael Claassens squirmed over to climax a Bath counterattack and Latham's first contribution after returning to the field was to act as a speed bump as Matt Banahan powered his way over for the bonus point. The replacement back-row Jonny Fa'amatuainu completed the rout in stoppage time to seal his side's fourth consecutive league victory and take Bath away from the relegation zone, but the Warriors, who go to Leeds in April, are looking horribly vulnerable, dreams of Europe put on hold in a desperate fight for survival.
