George Bush's favourite ex-Soviet capital with its exaggerated and now, as it seems, foolish hopes of joining Nato ought to have been a last redoubt of Rebublican loyalty as America played out its dignified transition. But here too, in the presence of the local head of USAid, numerous diplomats and non-governmental organisations' staff, the place was awash with tears of excitement as the inauguration unfolded on a large plasma screen. Cheers greeted the sight of Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn as they appeared on the west front of the Capital. The same for Bill and Hillary Clinton. Boos were launched at Dick Cheney as his wheelchair hove into view. \"Push him off the end of the pier\", shouted one voice. There were boos too for George Bush as he made his way down the steps of the Capitol on his own, \"abandoned by everyone including his wife\", said another voice. Silence fell during the swearing-in and the inaugural speech but gave way to cheers and toasts as America's new president finished his riveting address. Then the crowd rose as one to sing the Star-Spangled Banner. \"I hope I never see that fucker again\", said a woman who had worked in the Clinton administration as she watched Bush clamber into his helicopter. When the ex-President turned to wave, the crowd of several dozen Americans rose again and waved with a good deal more fervour than the departing Chief Executive. A US employee of the International Republican Institute, which conducts a \"democracy promotion\" programme in Georgia, was as delighted as any Democrat. Confessing to have voted for John McCain in spite of his being an \"asshole\", the official was thrilled to see Bush's departing back. It was a strong lesson for Georgians that patriotism can trump party loyalty. The room pulsated with pride at the way their country could conduct a peaceful and orderly transfer of power with such serenity, unlike Georgia's recent record of falsified elections and street demonstrations. For these Americans who have chosen to make their lives abroad, at least for a time, there was also a sense that they can hold their heads high again in the world beyond their shores. Beaming with delight, one man quoted the words Gerald Ford uttered after he took the oath after Nixon resigned in 1974: \"Our long national nightmare is over\". Or, as another put it graphically when he approached a stranger and discovered he was British, \"I think we are back. I apologise for the last eight years\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
