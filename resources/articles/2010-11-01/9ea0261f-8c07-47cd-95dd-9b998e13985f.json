As always, it all turned out well in the end: one of them stayed put, one of them was baked, and one denied everything. See if you can guess which was which... Monday, October 18 If the Chatterbox existed in the 80s then Bob Geldof might not have disliked Mondays so much [although that song was actually released in 1979 - Keef, pedantic music editor]. On this particular Monday, news was dominated by the possibility that a Mr. Rooney had some form of football related tantrum. I hope this means I wont have to see his sorry, spud-eye face again. As with bloatboy, I am obviously talking about 'Dwain_Rooneyz69'. The most important blog news on Monday came from RustyJames. He brought us hope, where there was none. He did something truly monumental that will live on in Chatterbox legend. He fixed a YLOD PS3. To fix your PS3 in the same way that Rusty fixed his you will need to:- \u2022 Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. (For fan assisted ovens, open fires or BBQs cooking times may vary - Tjvs) \u2022 Strip the PS3 down. \u2022 Remove all dust. \u2022 Remove the thermal compound using acetone. \u2022 Remove battery. \u2022 Cover components with tin toil. \u2022 Cook PS3 for 10 minutes in the preheated oven then allow to cool. \u2022 Replace the battery. \u2022 Apply a thin layer of thermal compound and reassemble. (Additional washers and electrical tape may be required. WARNING \u2013 results may vary). RustyJames, we salute you. Games chat revolved around MoH, Castlevania (curse that hidden life gem), Enslaved and PES. Film chat included discussion of Spanish horror movie REC and its inclusion of... [at this point the whole thing descended into an episode of Inbetweeners. they can get away with it. Sadly, we can't \u2013 Keef the censor] In other news, TimtheMonkey survived his shoulder operation. Quote of the day \"I got naked and covered myself in mud, ready to wrestle the enemy should they try and disarm my m-com.\" Schwen takes his Battlefield Bad Company 2 hobby very seriously Tuesday Tuesday 19 October, a time so far back in history that on this day Mr W Rooney was still claiming he really, really didn't want to play for Man Utd. The Chatterbox was unimpressed on the whole. The day began with talk of games but no one comes here looking for chat about that do they? Do they? Oh\u2026 Anyway, the other big topic of the morning was babies and the associated sleep deprivation. The Box once again showed its ability to offer beautifully judged expert advice. Some of the most helpful being \u2013 leave them to cry, ply them with whisky or literally hang them out to dry. TV's Supernanny just isn't needed round these parts. The morning was highlighted by the Box breaking out into a fervour over the news that Hibs had appointed Colin Calderwood as their new manager, and relief that it wasn't perma-tanned buffoon Jimmy Calderwood. Well, perhaps fervour is a bit strong, WeeCooper was optimistic but it seems the rest of the small indefatigable band of Chatterboxers who are devoted to Leith's finest were missing on Tuesday. The afternoon inevitably failed to live up to the high water mark that is Hibs-blog. There was some talk about PS3 games in the wake of the delay (again!) of the now mythological beast Gran Turismo 5. (Consensus was that Race Driver: Grid was a bit of alright, and indeed it is.) There was some talk about trickery (nay, witchcraft \u2013 Tjvs) on PES 2011, none of it was interesting. There was more talk about Mr Rooney. Would he make the hallowed journey to Easter Road? We would find out later in the week. Wednesday Good old hump day brought us the (possibly) devastating news that Jean Claude Van Damme may have had a heart attack. Also in the news, yet another blogger, Piip, discovered the absolute horror that is Naughty Bear. Games discussed included Demon's Souls, BFBC2 and PES. Fallout 3 had a resurgence in anticipation of Friday's release of Fallout: New Vegas. Kingpin18 was confronted by a predicament that haunts all gamers' nightmares: the breakdown of a console. His Playstation 3 glowed like an axe murderer's Christmas tree with the Yellow Light of Death. Luckily for Kingpin, his PS3 seemed to return to normal soon afterwards but the general consensus from the blog was that he should get rid of it as quickly as possible before it completely died. Thankfully, the chatterboxers were as helpful as ever. Catzilla put forward the following suggestion: \"I would suggest slapping the PS3 until it submits to your will, but you might injure your 'gaming hand', which is too risky.\" A worrying consensus emerged \u2013 that Kingpin18 should do the dishonourable thing, pull the wool over a game retailer's eyes and trade his device in. It was generally acknowledged and accepted that approaching Sony Customer Service about a YLOD console would be fruitless. I imagine that their workers and TonyHayers both received Customer Service Training that may have included the following: \u2022 Don't listen. \u2022 Don't accept responsibility for your product. \u2022 Appreciate the power of 'No'. \u2022 Never apologise. (This is only number 4? \u2013 Tjvs) \u2022 Get the customer to pay more. We could all learn something from that. SuperSmashin divulged a dilemma that could throw his work and personal life in to crisis \u2013 can a couple really work and live together? Super aptly summarised the division this moral question caused: \"Hmmm. Split opinion. By split, I mean the people with morals and the people without.\" With the onset of winter, weather blog arrived and discussion of preferred climate further divided the blog. SageSmith led the argument for hot weather supporters with his response to JCVD's possible heart attack: \"That's what happens if you keep taking your shirt off in cold weather.\" Of course, doing the splits in skin tight jeans every five minutes could also have been a factor. Quote of the day \"well, celebrated 16 years of marriage last night. got talking to two ladies in the pub who were still dressed in their asda uniforms. the ice breaker that got them talking with me and the missus was an almost imperceptible fart on my behalf that was utterly noxious. the older asda lady turned around and shouted at the top of her voice 'that is ******* disgusting'. Apparently she failed a mystery shopper test last week by not asking the customer who had two items and their own bag if they wanted a bag for life. Which brings me back to the issue of marriage.\" Painstructure recounts his wedding anniversary: Thursday As the week entered its home stretch the proud denizens of the Chatterbox were up for the challenge of passing the time before Fallout New Vegas was released. Stories abounded of people who had managed to get an early copy and of concern over reports of the game containing bugs (both literal and the game-crashing kind). However, some of the smaller PSN and Xbox Live games also got some attention with Super Meat Boy garnering high and often impenetrable praise from Manboet, EdibleVisions and decalcoman1a. Meanwhile Pokemon, SerenVikity and yours truly were enjoying the gentle pleasures of Costume Quest on the PS3. Fantomex led the early charge away from all this game-related chat (finally, back off track \u2013 Tjvs) with an idea for a topic of the day: a collection of people's top tips and advice. While obvious, it should probably be noted that following any blog advice is at your own risk. Some of the suggestions proffered before distractions took hold were: Fantomex: \"Never use shaving foam with a cooling effect when shaving below the belt.\" SageSmith: \"Never suggest a threesome with your wife and her best mate when you've had a few scoops and they are entirely sober.\" Simian: \"If you go to the bathroom after handling chillies wash your hands before you touch anything.....\" ImperfectRex: \"Tell the truth - it's easier to remember. No-one ever died from washing every day.\" Wise words. HereComesTreble's cryptic first post of the day \u2013 \"He had no arms or legs. He couldn't see, hear or speak. This is how he led a nation.\" \u2013 was revealed to be the tag-line of his as-yet unmade motion picture extravaganza. Limni was immediately on board (seeking a producers credit no doubt): \"I think you should call your film Torso. I would probably pay money to see it.\" HumofEvil kindly suggested a slightly darker finale than might have been planned, but one that is bound to secure Oscar short listing: \"I imagine a moving scene where he presses the big red button with his tongue. Ending all of us.\" After Lazybones asked for ideas of mountainside campsites that aren't haunted, RustyJames recalled the time he went camping without a tent or sleeping bag \u2013 \"isn't that just being homeless?\" Sheep2 was quick to ask. \"I just assumed I wouldn't really need a tent as it was summer. I also naively imagined I would probably meet some beautiful French peasant girl who would fall in love with me and let me sleep in her farmhouse (her father would be away),\" continued Rusty. Remember, just because you saw something in a movie once doesn't mean it will happen to you. This goes for flight attendants and French maids as well. Or so I'm told. MendozaLives tried to offer some more sensible advice: \"Still sounds a bit dangerous. Make sure you tell people where you'll be camping. Why don't you just stay at a nice inn?\" Eventually Lazy was swayed to consider the Lake District as an alternative. CraggyIsland however was unconvinced that the safety concerns had all been addressed: \"I'm seeing Lazy in a '999' special. Perhaps it can pay for Christmas in the Buerk household?\" The other more games-related topic of discussion in the afternoon centred around one of the blog's regular topics: trophies and achievements. It was kicked off by StilTeD recalling the masochistic relationship he was currently having with the Terminator Salvation game: \"There are few things in this world as utterly soul destroying, fun repellent and monumentally turgid as this game\u2026 I am so close to the end. I've come too far and it's now so very personal. That platinum will be mine and I will have earnt every sparkly glimmer. Paid in blood, in torment, in age.\" CunningStunt was one of a few to counter: \"Why on earth would you play a game that you don't enjoy?\" The debate levelled out with most people agreeing that as long as what you are playing remains enjoyable, then who are we to judge? As CatZilla nicely put it: \"How can someone who has spent 28 days on MW2 criticise someone spending two evenings on TS?\". And thus the topic was put to bed, for at least a week or two. Quotes of the day \" My Girlfriend made me watch Champions League last night, why can't we just switch it off and talk once in a while?\" GrizzlyDeer \"I have a portfolio of outdoor skills. The only outdoor thing I can't do is hang-glide.\" LazyBones Friday Satansallsmiles brought news of one whose feet (or four rubber stubs) he feels he is unworthy to clean. Risen from the dead, all hail our new Molten Messiah\u2122, the resurrected PS3. Along with a string of associated miracles, this should raise the price of the eBay auction. It only takes one believer to stand up and shout from the roof tops of his new found spirituality, and sure as eggs is Red Lion Branded eggs, more idiots follow suit, and a whole slew of console miracles floated to the surface. CatZilla believed that Liverpool's draw on Thursday night was also thanks to the same miracle source. Cameroon95 seems to have the Lee Majors Stuntman of PS3's, as his smashed through a car windscreen and took another two years before it YLOD'd And of course a miracle occurred at lunch time, with Rooney suddenly deciding that \u00a3150,000 a week was reason enough to stay on with Master League team Manchester United, rather than a transfer to Man Blue, as had been played out in my PES league game the night before. Fallout: New Vegas came out, with some 'boxers getting their deliveries last night, the blog was awash with acute radiation sickness. There were also tips for those still stuck on the wrong side of the continent in Fallout 3 while Elquesodiablo seems to have redecorated Brighton to look a little bit more like Vegas-On-Sea. RedDread is still trying to distinguish Birmingham from the post-nuclear holocaust New Vegas, while Killerbee would prefer the rad land postal service to that provided by Shopto. Discussion then turned to the best bin to store all your rubbish in, and whether to succumb to your Megaton urges. Colonicus then brought us all back to Nu Earth with the boast that his PS2 could survive a Fallout-style apocalypse. Blasphemer! In true blog style, and in the spirit of inclusivity, the conversation turned to how long, and how many posts, users had put into the blog. Using the Rule of Tony (or RoT) and discounting the quotes from TV, Film and Book, there seems to be a whole page or two of original content stored on the Guardian Servers created solely by Chatterboxes. Hopefully the Linux Server running on a modded Xbox in the living room of Greg Howson never gets turned off and that essential list of zombie weapons is never lost. Heaven forefend. All praise to the PS3, no offence, etc. Quotes of the week \"In our fathers' times you needed to be able to strip an engine of a Ford Sierra or hang a door to be considered a real man. Before that, you probably needed to go to war to prove your worth. Ever since the dawn of time these trials have existed; caveboys had to kill a dinosaur in hand-to-hand combat to complete their rite of passage to become a caveman. Well this weekend, I made those same steps in the modern era. I fixed a YLOD PS3.\" RustyJames, On his heroic/mad sounding fix for a broken console \"...the rest will be released on receipt of your pancreas.\" Bloatboy... and some say the art of negotiation is dead Games: Fallout: NV, Medal of Honour, PES, Enslaved, Super Meat Boy. This week's Best of was brought you by: Foolsgold, Seren, Onedaveofmany and Smellavision... and crudely edited by Tjvs. With Officepest out of the office on \u2013 cough \u2013 \"study leave\", special thanks to SerenVikity for pulling a double shift."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
