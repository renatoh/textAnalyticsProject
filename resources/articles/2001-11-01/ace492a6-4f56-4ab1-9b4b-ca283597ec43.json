That goalless draw in April's Uefa Cup semi-final first leg prompted the Spanish media to accuse G\u00e9rard Houllier of negative tactics. Such criticism papered over the Catalans' own shortcomings as they lost the second leg 1-0 and limped out of the competition. \"The Spanish mentality is to play attacking, attractive football to please people but we got a good result at Barcelona and went on to win the Uefa Cup,\" said the Liverpool centre-half Sami Hyypia. \"They didn't. They can say whatever they want; we lifted the cup.\" \"We weren't able to keep the ball in that match as we would have liked,\" added Liverpool's assistant manager Phil Thompson, \"but the defenders did their job and didn't get the credit they deserved.\" Thompson and Barcelona's coach Carles Rexach scored in the 1975-76 Uefa Cup semi- final on this stage. That ended 1-1, both goals coming in one minute and the Reds reaching the final 2-1 on aggregate. \"A win is not the be-all and end-all,\" said Thompson. \"But we've got two games before the winter break; we have to make a positive claim in the group.\" Liverpool (4-4-2; probable): Dudek; Carragher, Henchoz, Hyypia, Riise; Gerrard, McAllister, Murphy, Smicer; Heskey, Owen. Barcelona (4-2-3-1; probable): Bonano; Reiziger, De Boer, Andersson, Coco; Xavi, Cocu; Luis Enrique, Rivaldo, Kluivert; Saviola."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
