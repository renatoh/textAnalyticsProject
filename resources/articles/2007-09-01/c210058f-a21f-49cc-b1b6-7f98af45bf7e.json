The rock listings will contain a gig at the O2 arena by Led Zeppelin, while the football pages report on Diego Maradona playing for Argentina at Villa Park against an England team containing Glenn Hoddle and Bryan Robson. The question of whether to relive memories at a time when the memory is beginning to fade is a fundamental one for performers. The two most furiously anticipated reunions in popular culture - the Beatles and Monty Python - became impossible through the deaths of members, but most of those who have a fanclub have eventually returned to stage with a larger collar size. Appropriately to the age of the participants, these latest comebacks seem to have been motivated by thoughts of mortality. Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin were moved to reunite by the death of Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, whose music charity will benefit from ticket sales. Maradona, whose abuse of drink and drugs has brought him close to the last rites several times, may not be able to cash many more cheques from football as large as the \u00a3300,000 he's said to be receiving for restaging the 1986 World Cup quarter-final, in which he beat England by punching the ball into the net. But these motivations are also fitting because the audience is drawn to such events by thoughts of death as well. At gigs by superannuated bands, and cricket and football matches played by Veteran XIs, the spectators are present as much for autobiographical as for biographical reasons, trying to wind back their own clock or recapture former days. There will always be a market for comeback gigs in sport and music because generations tend to stick together. It's no accident that a person's best friends will tend to have birth dates close to theirs. This is partly practical - meeting at school or college, shared television and music references - but also psychological. We feel most comfortable with those who are the same distance from the grave, the much younger or much older frightening us with glimpses of what is in the past or future. If they're still going, then we must still be going. I'm Still Standing, as triumphantly sung by Elton John - who never seems to have stopped touring, his audiences ageing with him, and who will presumably remain on the road until the lyrics have to be amended to explain the fact that both he and the piano are on wheels. Even signs of weakness are reassuring. If Status Quo now need to sit down for a little rest and a cup of tea after a particularly hectic medley of former hits, then there is some consolation in the fact that they're decaying at least at the speed that we are. And though, 20 years ago, Diego Maradona was a million times better at football than any contemporary spectators in the stands, fiftysomethings watching him at Villa Park next month might not be completely deluded in thinking that they could beat him over 100 metres. There is, though, surely something undignified about the people on both sides of the crash barriers at these events. Gary Lineker will apparently have no more involvement in the England v Argentina game than a symbolic kickoff, and this seems sensible. Sports stars who have been canny with their finances are wise to stop playing when they can no longer give their best. If age or distance kept you from seeing Dennis Lillee or John McEnroe in the fit and terrifying flesh, it can be no consolation, and may in fact expand the disappointment, to watch these athletic heroes panting and wincing through a charity or exhibition match. Music is slightly different, because singers in particular can bring a life experience and technical expertise to work from their earlier years which makes the piece a new experience, compensating for any loss of puff or beauty. However, with the Rolling Stones, Status Quo and The Who all rocking into pensionable age, the question arises of where the line must be drawn. Can they really still be doing the same at 70? And if the aim is to slow down time, the trick has already been achieved. Led Zeppelin in concert and Maradona facing Robson in football are freely available, to those unable to see them at the time, in recordings which seal the participants in their prime. So, despite all the hope they may give to the old, Led Zeppelin and the England and Argentina teams are making a mistake in restaging former glories. No previous generation has had quite so much technology for freezing and keeping the past. We - and they - would be better off watching the DVDs of when they could really do it. However hard the millions trying to get tickets for Led Zeppelin pretend, the stairway to heaven only goes in one direction, and it's pointless to pretend there's a down escalator. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
