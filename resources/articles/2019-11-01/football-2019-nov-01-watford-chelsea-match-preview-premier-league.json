Frank Lampard has warned his team against complacency, and has a selection dilemma up front after Christian Pulisic\u2019s hat-trick against Burnley. Antonio R\u00fcdiger is unavailable, while the match also comes too soon for Ross Barkley and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores has called on the home fans to make plenty of noise at Vicarage Road on Saturday. Watford\u2019s 4-1 win in this fixture last season is a sign of what they are capable of doing to top-six sides that underestimate them.
