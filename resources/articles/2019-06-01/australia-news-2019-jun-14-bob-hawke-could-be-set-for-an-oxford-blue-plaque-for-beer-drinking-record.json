A formal proposal will be put to Oxford city council to mark the former Australian prime minister\u2019s youthful achievement. Hawke was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford between 1953 and 1956. In 1954 he skolled a yard of ale \u2013 two-and-a-half pints, or 1.4 litres \u2013 in 11 seconds, then a world record. It is proposed that an official blue plaque, dozens of which are dotted around Oxford commemorating the achievements of such luminaries as Edmund Halley, TE Lawrence, JRR Tolkien and Roger Bannister \u2013 should be placed in St Helen\u2019s Passage, a narrow, winding thoroughfare which leads to the Turf Tavern where Hawke\u2019s record is widely believed to have been set, though Hawke himself maintained the feat was achieved in a nearby college dining room. Labor party luminaries Gareth Evans and Kevin Rudd have lent their support to the blue plaque proposal. \u201cOxford didn\u2019t tame Bob Hawke \u2013 as the proposed plaque near the Turf would no doubt make clear \u2013 but it was certainly formative intellectually, rounding out the skill-sets and instincts that made him one of Australia\u2019s longest-serving, greatest, and internationally influential prime ministers. It would be great if the city could appropriately recognise him,\u201d Evans, foreign minister in Hawke\u2019s governments, said. Oxford Labour councillor and former lord mayor Susanna Pressel said Hawke\u2019s achievements in government \u2013 especially in fighting inequality and injustice, such as his efforts to end apartheid \u2013 should be recognised. \u201cWe are proud to be an international city that welcomes people from all over the world. Bob Hawke deserves our admiration for all he did to fight against racism and inequality, both in Australia and more widely. Such principles should be celebrated, perhaps especially when they seem to be under threat.\u201d Hawke\u2019s 11-second mark is the stuff of legend around Oxford, but there is some conjecture as to where the record actually took place. His Guinness Book of World Records entry cites Oxford, and the Turf Tavern pub \u2013 a 14th century pub that historically was the home of Oxford\u2019s sly bookmakers, just outside the city walls \u2013 has a blackboard marking the achievement. The Turf was also the watering hole of Oscar Wilde during his time at Oxford, as well as where Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher drank. It was the place, reputedly, where Bill Clinton \u201cdid not inhale\u201d from a marijuana joint. However, the version of events laid down by Hawke in his memoirs insists the world record was set not at the Turf but at the nearby dining hall of University College, one of the constituent colleges of Oxford University where Hawke was a student, as an arcane punishment for failing to wear his academic gown to dinner. \u201cSome bastard had \u2018borrowed\u2019 mine,\u201d Hawke wrote, and as a punishment he was \u201csconced\u201d, forced to beat the \u201csconcemaster\u201d in drinking from a pewter pot \u2013 equivalent to a yard glass \u2013 or face a fine. \u201cI was too broke for the fine and necessity became the mother of ingestion. I downed the contents of the pot in eleven seconds, left the sconcemaster floundering, and entered the Guinness Book of Records with the fastest time ever recorded. \u201cThis feat was to endear me to some of my fellow Australians more than anything else I ever achieved.\u201d It is also entirely possible \u2013 indeed, not implausible \u2013 that Hawke may have skolled more than one yard glass during his time at Oxford. He famously \u201cgave up the drink\u201d in order to become prime minister, but in his retirement showed he had not lost the skill. Into his 80s, he was regularly spotted on TV, usually at the cricket, skolling beers given to him by members of the public."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
