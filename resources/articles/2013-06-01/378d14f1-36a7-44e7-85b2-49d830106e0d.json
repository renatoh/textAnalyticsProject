That won't stop us all convincing ourselves that Australia's opening game against England is a meaningful curtain-raiser for the important stuff to follow though, will it? Michael Clarke has spoken of the potential to carry \"confidence and momentum\" into the Ashes from a strong showing at the tournament, but Ashes history has a habit of rendering lead-in successes in the shorter formats a furphy. In the prelude to their unsuccessful Ashes campaign in 2009, Australian preparations were not assisted by the scheduling of the World Twenty20. A one-day tournament such as this is probably preferable by a matter of degrees. Barring any catastrophic injuries, always an imminent threat where Australian fast bowlers are concerned, inferences towards Ashes hopes will primarily be drawn from the success or otherwise of the Australian batsmen. In that light, the less said about their showing in the warm-up game against India, the better. Shane Watson will be looking to shore up an Ashes berth by continuing on where he left off in the IPL (and against West Indies at the weekend), as ineffectual as that preparation feels for what will no doubt confront him in July. Watson's successes often seem to pose as many problems for Australia as his failures; a unique situation befitting a uniquely polarising figure. Both David Warner and Phillip Hughes have some doubters on their backs, if not irresistible replacements pressuring them from below. Warner has a pair of ducks in the warm-up games so far; he'd hope his luck is about to change. If one of them were to botch this dress rehearsal in sufficient magnitude, it would surely leave Usman Khawaja thankful for his omission. Will the real Mitchell Marsh please stand up? Every couple of years, the Australian cricketing public narrows its sights on a likely looking all-rounder and doggedly analyses their every waking movement until the player in question either develops a persecution complex or declares he is not the next Keith Miller and assumes the foetal position. It's just the way Australia does things. Though boasting enviable physical gifts and sustained patches of excellence in all three formats, Andrew Symonds often seemed hell-bent on implosion. His ersatz limited-overs precursor, the Victorian Ian Harvey, just never fulfilled any kind of potential, but this tends to be the rule, not the exception. More recent casualties of this cricketing Hunger Games have included Dan Christian and Moises Henriques. The next cab off the rank is Mitchell Marsh, whose name is steeped in Australian cricketing lore. So far, if it hasn't been off-field imbroglios, it's been injuries preventing him from more appearances for his country. Marsh is a player of substantial talent and enormous potential. You'd hope he absorbed some lessons from the plight of Glenn Maxwell on Australia's recent tour of India and resolved that these gifts alone are not the determining factors for success on the international stage. It's now four years since Marsh made his limited overs debut for Western Australia but it's also worth remembering that he's only 21 years old and still building on his spindly frame. Though his first-class batting numbers don't currently make for good reading, his domestic one-day form engenders confidence that his talents are balanced. Thus far Marsh's bowling has tended to produce wickets but Clarke would be looking for an improved economy rate from the youngster. If Clarke is also to take a captaincy lesson from Maxwell's recent struggles, it may be to ban anyone within 500 metres of Marsh using the term, \"X Factor\". But that he remains. The surprise packets that shouldn't be If Marsh's progress has been mitigated by injury and misadventure , the scant attention paid to James Faulkner as a result has been of no detriment to the burly Tasmanian. He heads a list of players looking to establish a regular place in the side. Faulkner has been Australian cricket's quiet achiever over the past 12 months and a young man who has displayed the capacity for format-hopping that most other contenders have found insurmountable. A muscular, whole-hearted cricketer, Faulkner could have been transplanted from any era but has a thoroughly modern proficiency for variations of pace. This, coupled with the ability to move the ball both ways, makes him a constant wicket-taking threat in the shorter forms of the game. There is a reason that Faulkner has been named Tasmania's best player for the past two domestic seasons: he makes important breakthroughs and scores vital runs. For all the doom and gloom that tends to surround Australian cricket, to think that there is still improvement left in the 23-year-old should be cause for cautious excitement. At the other end of the age scale, 33-year-old Adam Voges has an opportunity to capitalise on Australia's dearth of consistent, resourceful batsmen. He's a dependable player tailor-made to fill the Mike Hussey role in Australia's middle-order and adapts well to most game situations. Voges would be well aware that the tournament represents an excellent opportunity to cement his spot for the coming 12 months. Clint McKay \u2013 Australia's anonymous star There is a surprising lack of love for Clint McKay in this country. He might not be flashy, he might not be quick, but McKay lets his figures do the talking; and what extraordinary figures they are. In actual fact, he has the third best bowling average for an Australian in the history of one-day international cricket, sitting up on Mount Rushmore with Lillee and McGrath. His strike rate (an incredible 28.6), average and economy rate are all also far better than those of the man widely regarded as the world's best fast bowler, South African Dale Steyn. Perhaps owing to his unflappable demeanour and metronomic consistency, he remains a relatively anonymous figure in the Australian cricket hierarchy. Yet for a cricketing nation so short on good news stories of late, it is a mystery that McKay is not a household name. The Victorian was Australia's one-day player of the year for the past season but if you asked many to name the country's five best fast bowlers, he'd probably be lucky to get a look-in. All of this probably doesn't concern McKay a great deal, but England, New Zealand and Sri Lanka will underestimate his influence at their peril in their opening group matches against the Aussies. Vale Champions Trophy This will be the last time that nations compete for the ICC Champions Trophy. The big question is whether anyone will actually notice. Chris Gayle is the highest run-scorer in ICC Champions Trophy history, which is actually a decent barometer of its prestige; if Gayle is great at something it probably doesn't matter very much. Actually, is Gayle even going to bother turning up? Morphing into its present form from the original and far less auspicious title of the ICC Knock-Out Tournament, the Champions Trophy is the World Cup's poor cousin from the boondocks, fitting somewhere between a triangular series and flicking channels to see which football game is on in the imagination of sports lovers. Australia has actually won it twice but if you held a gun to the head of even the most committed cricket fan, they'd struggle to name the years in which these victories occurred. In place of the tournament, the ICC claim to be introducing the new ICC World Test Championship. I say \"claim\" because the new venture is currently and rather ominously slated not to appear before 2017 despite earlier claims it would happen in 2013. If the ICC is able to fit it in between barnstorming fixtures like Australia's seven game ODI tour of India later this year and the seemingly endless array of domestic T20 leagues, they will please many cricket traditionalists. No one will hold their breath though."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
