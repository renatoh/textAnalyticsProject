Morrison, ranked as potentially one of the pre-eminent footballers of his generation, is already the subject of a 12-month referral order after two court cases within the past six months, and the 18-year-old has been warned that if he breaks that order he will be sent to prison for a year. He has also been advised by a district judge to seek counselling about domestic abuse after twice being arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend \u2013 both cases were dropped because she would not give evidence \u2013 and receiving a police caution for assaulting his mother. The latest case follows a complaint from the family of a teenage mugging victim who gave evidence against two of Morrison's friends in a robbery trial last year. In January Morrison admitted two charges of intimidating a witness after subjecting the same boy to a two-day ordeal to try to stop him from going to court. He had been warned he could face a spell in detention but the judge decided to allow him to continue his football career. The victim was described at the time as so traumatised his family wanted to leave Manchester. Morrison, an England youth international, has become an intense source of frustration at Old Trafford because of the frequency with which he has embroiled himself in trouble, and the sense that he is not doing everything he should to make the most of what is a rare talent. The teenager made his United debut in a Carling Cup tie against Wolverhampton Wanderers last season and there is a genuine belief within the club that he if he can knuckle down he has the ability to be a formidable player. Morrison showed flashes of that talent during United's victorious run in last season's FA Youth Cup and there had been encouraging feedback from Salford's youth offending team lately about an apparent improvement in his behaviour. The teenager has denied any further wrongdoing and was not arrested, attending Swinton police station on Tuesday morning by appointment, but he was asked to sign a letter outlining the seriousness of the issue and warning him he could be charged if he was found to be committing an offence. Morrison was accompanied by a solicitor and advised to stay away from the college where the alleged victim studies. Morrison was meant to be involved in United's reserve game at Shrewsbury last weekend but, after initially being named on the squad list, he was withdrawn at the last moment, with no explanation offered. Nor did he play for the reserves at Fleetwood on Wednesday night At the end of last season he apologised on his Twitter account for having sent derogatory tweets during and after the club's player-of-the-year awards dinner. Morrison sent one message from the event, describing it as \"shit\", and the next day he was equally unimpressed, taking issue with everything apart from Ryan Tunnicliffe being named youth-team player of the year. Morrison wrote: \"What a load from last nights awardss well done tunnerz tho appart from dat - Shit\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
