The review will commence this week and senior players are keen to highlight the areas they believe contributed to the squad\u2019s underachievement. Tom Wood indicated that feedback from squad members would be pooled rather than submitted individually as happened in 2011 when a range of criticisms of the coaching team were leaked. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finalised anything yet but the feeling is that the leadership group and senior players will collect feedback, probably in clubs and player groups,\u201d the Northampton flanker said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to filter out some of the nonsense, the white noise and the individual frustrations to make sure we get a group appraisal, rather than 31 voices coming from everywhere.\u201d The England squad are well aware the futures of the coach, Stuart Lancaster, and his assistants are under intense scrutiny and feel their side of the story needs to be heard. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it to witch-hunt, to pick anyone apart or to sell anyone out,\u201d Wood continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure we get everyone\u2019s feelings aired so we can move on in a positive way. I hope we have enough input as we\u2019re the men on the ground. We\u2019ve got some honest players who will tell it as it is. Hopefully that\u2019s taken into consideration. If so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get the right outcome. When you don\u2019t succeed in an England shirt questions need asking but as long as no one questions our commitment, desire and togetherness as a team I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d Many of the recurring question-marks surrounding the Lancaster regime have centred on selection and on-field decision-making and Wood will be among those offering his views. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a few minor technical things I would offer up as feedback. I don\u2019t want to give those right now because I think they should be said to people\u2019s faces first before I make them public. But they\u2019re only minor things. They\u2019re not things where you\u2019d say: \u2019Fix that and you\u2019d have won the World Cup.\u2019\u201d Mike Brown believes, however, that England\u2019s players were guilty of letting down their coaches at key moments in the tournament. \u201cMaybe this World Cup came a bit too early for us,\u201d said the full-back, revealing he had struggled to sleep and had endured \u201cone of the worst weeks of my life\u201d in the wake of England\u2019s premature exit. \u201cOur general discipline wasn\u2019t good enough. Also \u2013 and it\u2019s been a problem for the last couple of years \u2013 the way we put teams to the sword. You need to be ruthless. \u201cIndividually we need to strive to be the best players in the world in our position. Look at the New Zealanders, most of them would get into a world XV. At the moment, if we\u2019re honest, which of our players would make a world XV? Which of our players would be in a Lions XV? Probably a couple but not many.\u201d Nick Easter, who scored three tries in England\u2019s 60-3 thrashing of Uruguay on Saturday, feels the squad can bounce back sooner rather than later. \u201cThe future is really exciting,\u201d he said, confirming his Six Nations availability if required. \u201cThe pool of talent is there and the potential for world class players is there. We were beaten by two very good teams. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is we don\u2019t look at Japan in 2019. First you\u2019ve got to set goals like: \u2018Let\u2019s become the best team in the northern hemisphere, let\u2019s win a Six Nations, win a grand slam.\u2019 Let\u2019s win those games so that, when the next World Cup comes along, we know what to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
