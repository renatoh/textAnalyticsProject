Despite one of the victims\u2019 families pleading for their son\u2019s death not to be used as an excuse for kneejerk political reaction, Johnson claimed that \u201ca lefty government\u201d was responsible for Usman Khan being freed. The family of Jack Merritt called for the murder of \u201cour beautiful, talented boy\u201d to not be exploited for political gain, as police named the second victim as Saskia Jones, a prisoner rehabilitation volunteer. But the Conservatives nonetheless sought to push a perceived political advantage on the issue, promising to end early release for people convicted of terrorism, while saying Jeremy Corbyn was unable to keep the public safe. Early on Monday, as the day\u2019s front pages emerged covering a proposed Tory crackdown on those freed after serving sentences for terrorism, Merritt\u2019s father David tweeted saying: \u201cDon\u2019t use my son\u2019s death, and his and his colleague\u2019s photos \u2013 to promote your vile propaganda. Jack stood against everything you stand for \u2013 hatred, division, ignorance.\u201d Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, accused Johnson of going \u201cstraight from a tragedy to reheating pre-packaged political lines smearing the Labour party\u201d. The political row came as: \u2022 MI5 began an inquiry into how a suspect whom they had under \u201cactive investigation\u201d could have launched such an attack. \u2022 It emerged that investigators discounted Isis\u2019s claim of responsibility and believe Khan acted alone in the planning, which could have started as little as 24 hours before he struck. \u2022 West Midlands police arrested a man who had been convicted of the same bomb plot as Khan on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. It followed a review of licence conditions after the London Bridge attack. \u2022 Johnson said there were \u201cprobably about 74\u201d convicted terrorists who had now been freed, saying these would be \u201cproperly invigilated to make sure there is no threat\u201d. Khan was released under licence a year ago, seven years into a jail term imposed for taking part in an al-Qaida-inspired bomb plot. On Friday he murdered Jones and Merritt in a knife attack at a conference on prisoner rehabilitation. Khan was tackled by members of the public on London Bridge, and then shot dead by police. A police statement naming Jones said she had been volunteering at the event organised by Learning Together, a programme run by Cambridge University\u2019s criminology institute. A family statement called her \u201ca funny, kind, positive influence at the centre of many people\u2019s lives\u201d. Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together. In a statement, his family reiterated their call for his murder to not be exploited for political gain. They said: \u201cWe know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary.\u201d The family added: \u201cJack lived his principles: he believed in redemption and rehabilitation \u2013 not revenge \u2013 and he always took the side of the underdog.\u201d On Sunday, Johnson had used a lengthy interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show to blame Labour for the early release of Khan. The prime minister said: \u201cHis release was necessary under the law because of the automatic early release scheme under which he was sentenced \u2013 that was the reality \u2013 and that was brought in by Labour with the support of Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour party.\u201d He added: \u201cI think it is ridiculous, I think it is repulsive, that individuals as dangerous as this man should be allowed out after serving only eight years and that\u2019s why we are going to change the law.\u201d The reality of the case is more complex. Khan was jailed in 2012 under an indeterminate public protection (IPP) sentence, a system scrapped under the Conservative-led government the same year. An appeal in 2013 resulted in the sentence being replaced by one of 16 years, and he was freed after serving just under half of that. Shortly before Johnson\u2019s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, his staff sent out a lengthy Twitter thread on the PM\u2019s account explaining what they said was the legal context. This prompted a popular legal blogger and best-selling author, known as the Secret Barrister, to accuse No 10 of having copied and pasted parts of a blogpost they had written on the issue to debunk earlier inaccuracies made by Johnson. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, condemned Johnson\u2019s response to the attack. She told BBC Radio 5: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a community which is coming together in a brilliant way and straight out of the door the prime minister\u2019s trying to make it an election issue \u2013 I just think it\u2019s pretty distasteful.\u201d But the foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, denied that the Conservatives were politicising the attack. However, he cited the incident to warn against what he said would be harmful Labour policies. \u201cThe question is, for people who are watching the show, who they trust: Boris Johnson to keep us safe or Jeremy Corbyn, with his track record?\u201d he told Sky News. The Labour leader said on Sunday that convicted terrorists should \u201cnot necessarily\u201d serve their full sentence, calling instead for a wider focus on issues such as rehabilitation and deradicalisation In a later speech, Corbyn condemned cuts to areas such as probation and mental health or youth services, saying this was likely to create \u201cmissed chances to intervene in the lives of people who go on to commit inexcusable acts\u201d. Blaming the Iraq war and other UK foreign policy decisions for fuelling terrorism, Corbyn said: \u201cReal security doesn\u2019t only come from strong laws and intelligence, it comes also from effective public services that have the funding they need.\u201d Cambridge University\u2019s vice-chancellor, Stephen J Toope, said he was devastated by the attack. He said: \u201cWhat should have been a joyous opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this unique and socially transformative programme, hosted by our Institute of Criminology, was instead disrupted by an unspeakable criminal act.\u201d The NHS confirmed on Sunday night that one of the three people injured in the attack had been allowed to return home. The other two remained in a stable condition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
