The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is due to meet his counterparts from the UK, France and Germany on Saturday, somewhere in Europe, to try to mend the rift \u2013 largely over the lifting of sanctions on Iran \u2013 and restore a united front. On Friday night, Barack Obama spoke by telephone to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande about the talks. The talks with Iran are due to resume in Switzerland on Wednesday, which would leave just five days before a deadline for reaching a framework agreement. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a series of intensive discussions with Iran this week, and given where we are in the negotiations, it\u2019s an important time for high-level consultations with our partners in these talks,\u201d US spokeswoman Marie Harf said. \u201cTherefore, Secretary Kerry will travel tomorrow to meet in Europe with German foreign minister Steinmeier, British foreign secretary Hammond, and French foreign minister Fabius to discuss the ongoing \u2026 discussions with Iran.\u201d Meanwhile, Republicans in the US Congress have also not given up their fight to block any agreement they believe is too lenient by refusing to lift certain sanctions. Despite criticising more hawkish Senate colleagues who sent a warning letter to Iran, foreign affairs chairman Bob Corker predicted on Friday that he will still be able to assemble enough support from Democrats to pass legislation forcing Obama to consult Congress. The official reason for the adjournment is the need for members of Iranian delegation to attend the funeral on Sunday of President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s mother, who died on Friday aged 90. But the talks had already stalled because of differences over sanctions, and the emergence of splits within the group of six major powers on how tough a position to take. The sharpest split is between the US, which had proposed a scheme for a phased lifting of UN sanctions in return for concrete Iranian actions to limit its nuclear programme, and France, which wants to offer only a symbolic easing of the punitive measures imposed over the past decade. Diplomats say the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, telephoned the French delegation in Lausanne to ensure it did not make further concessions, and to insist that the bulk of UN sanctions could only be lifted if Iran gave a full explanation of evidence suggesting it may have done development work on nuclear warhead design in the past. \u201cWe have been negotiating with Iran for 12 [years]. We shouldn\u2019t be rushed into an agreement which will have to be comprehensive,\u201d the French ambassador to Washington, Gerard Araud, tweeted during the talks. \u201cFor France, any agreement to be acceptable will have to give concrete guarantees on all issues. We won\u2019t bypass any of them.\u201d The French position is unacceptable to the Iranians, who argue they would never be able to prove a negative, and disprove evidence of a weapons programme they say is forged. \u201cThey don\u2019t like it. They say it\u2019s a deal-breaker. They don\u2019t want it at all,\u201d said a European diplomat involved in the talks. But the diplomat added there was \u201cno way\u201d France would relax its position. The US offer on sanctions is to lift UN sanctions in layers in return each \u201cirreversible\u201d step Iran makes to scale down and limit its nuclear programme. There would be mechanisms in place by which sanctions would \u201cspring back\u201d if Iran violated the agreement, without the need for consensus in the UN security council. It is broadly supported by the UK and Germany, while Russia and China, the other members of the six-nation group, would offer more generous terms. Tehran is reluctant to accept sanctions relief based on milestones, but diplomats say the French position would be a complete deal-breaker. They say the Iranians would be very unlikely to admit past weapons work, which if revealed would demonstrate that the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, had misled the world. Better, US diplomats argue, to focus on limiting the current Iranian programme and worry about allegations about the past a few years down the road. US and French officials have also clashed in Lausanne over contrasting briefings their delegations have provided to the press. \u201cEither there are real differences between the American and French positions or the French are posturing here in a way that is not helpful. So this meeting on Saturday will be helpful if it lets the Americans and French settle their differences,\u201d said Reza Marashi, the research director at the National Iranian American Council. \u201cEither the French are going to have to budge or the Americans are. But if the Americans budge that increases the likelihood that the Iranians are not going to be able to get to yes as an answer. President Obama called his French counterpart, Hollande, on Friday afternoon to discuss the talks, the White House said. According to a statement, the presidents \u201creaffirmed their commitment to achieving a long term comprehensive deal that fully and verifiably addresses the international community\u2019s concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, while noting that Iran must take steps to resolve several remaining issues.\u201d Kerry went to pay personal condolences to the president\u2019s brother, Hossein Fereydoun, who had been attending the negotiations on the shores of Lake Geneva, but the gesture did not overcome the downbeat atmosphere overhanging the negotiations 11 days before a deadline to produce a framework agreement. Overnight, Obama issued a message marking the Iranian new year, Nowruz, saying: \u201cWe have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries.\u201d But he added that it was up to Iran\u2019s leaders to choose between two paths. \u201cIf they cannot agree to a reasonable deal, they will keep Iran on the path it\u2019s on today \u2013 a path that has isolated Iran, and the Iranian people, from so much of the world,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOn the other hand, if Iran\u2019s leaders can agree to a reasonable deal, it can lead to a better path \u2013 the path of greater opportunities for the Iranian people.\u201d Zarif quickly tweeted a riposte, saying it was the west that had to make the hard choices necessary for an deal. \u201cIranians have already made their choice: Engage with dignity. It\u2019s high time for the US and its allies to chose: pressure or agreement,\u201d he said. The latest session in the 18 months of negotations had begun hopefully. The central issue of Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment capacity had been largely settled. Over the lifetime of a decade-long arrangement, it would have operating capacity equivalent to 6,000 of its current model centrifuges, a 40% reduction. However, that left unresolved what Iran would get in return. The EU is offering to lift its oil embargo and Iran\u2019s exclusion from Swift electronic banking, while Obama is offering to suspend US congressional sanctions by presidential waiver. However, the Iranians see UN sanctions as crucial, because they declare the country\u2019s nuclear programme to illegal and therefore justify all the other sanctions. \u201cThey consider it insulting and unfair that they would stay on the agenda of the security council, saying Iran is a threat to international peace and security,\u201d a European negotiator said. \u201cThey say if we have a deal, we are not a threat any more.\u201d The White House also still has an uphill battle back in Washington too. Administration officials insisted on Thursday it would refuse to sign any bill requiring Congressional approval of the deal, but senator Corker now claims he would be able to assemble a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to override such a presidential veto. \u201cI believe, in spite of some of the drama we have had over the last two weeks internally, we will have a veto proof majority to make that happen,\u201d he told of meeting of Republican lawyers. \u201cSome of my senator friends are being lobbied heavily by the administration but this is the sort of role that Congress should be playing,\u201d added the Tennessee senator, who says he pushed back a planned vote until after the deadline for the Geneva talks to bring more Democrats on board. Speaking after his remarks on Friday, Corker acknowledged only certain US sanctions would be affected by Congressional disapproval but insisted this would remain a significant blow to any deal that fell short of what lawmakers felt was necessary. \u2018We have got to have other countries involved for us to be most effective, but I still think the United States not being part of a deal going forward would have significant impact,\u201d he told The Guardian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
