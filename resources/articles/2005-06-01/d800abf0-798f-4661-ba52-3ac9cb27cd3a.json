Christopher Wilson's hilarious, thoughtful novel suffers in parts from this syndrome. Lee Cotton is born Leifur Nils Kristjansson Saint Marie du Cotton, his genes 'knitted from rainbow yarns'. Lee, you see, is a white black boy. A straw-haired, blue-eyed pretty white kid whose mother is black and his father a blonde Icelandic sailor, now long gone. From his father, Lee gained his looks; from his mother, his black identity; and from his grandmother, Celeste, his voodoo abilities to hear other people's thoughts. Wilson judges this tricksy literary quirk well, giving us glimpses of the thoughts of the characters Lee meets, often with hilarious effect. Where the book falls down is in Lee's extended Forrest Gump-style wanderings through the race movement and identity politics of the Fifties and Sixties. He starts out in Eureka, Mississippi, in 1950, picking his way innocently through the tensions of the pre-civil rights South. When using buses, he must be careful not to offend: white-skinned, he would stand out sitting with the blacks at the back; likewise, he'd be seen as self-important if he sat at the front. Walk, his mother tells him pragmatically. Caught between these worlds, a stream of other people's thoughts constantly in his head, Lee is a touching but humorous character whose easy narrator's voice draws the reader along without the burden of sentimentality: 'Folks forever telling me I'm odd-looking. But the way I saw it, I wasn't strange, just misplaced. Different Mama, different home, I'd seem natural as Johnson weed, dashed hopes and broken crockery.' A misfit, Lee drifts on the outskirts of his small-town existence until he falls for Angelina, the daughter of a local Klan member, Byron Clement. At their first meeting, Angel tells Lee: 'I'm looking for a hero to bring beauty and awe into my life.' Lee is not the sort of hero Angel has in mind. When Byron finds out about their relationship, he takes a baseball bat to Lee's head and leaves him for dead (his premature meeting with God - 'Lee Cotton ... out of Eureka, Mississippi. Baseball incident. I guess you been expecting me?' - is a gem). Lee finds himself in hospital after surgery in which his brain is cleaved in two, and is reborn a sort of idiot savant who can complete psychological tests with ease and read minds to a degree. Lee is drafted for Vietnam, but ends up in a psychological warfare unit in the Nevada desert. Wilson has perhaps overloaded Lee with signs, symbols, meanings and events. After his run-in with the army, Lee has a sex change, giving the novel a double whammy of gender and race, more exploration of identity. If all of this tricksy flitting sounds too much, it is Cotton himself who makes this novel a treat. With his easy charm that is enthralling and endearing, he is an Everyman whose ballad is worth hearing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
