On Thursday, international medical journal the Lancet published its Countdown report, a multi-institutional project led by University College in London that examines progress on climate change and health throughout the world. Its first two assessments were published in 2017 and 2018, with annual assessments continuing until 2030, consistent with the near-term timeline of the Paris climate agreement. Findings relating to Australia were tracked and published by the Medical Journal of Australia. Australia was assessed across 31 indicators divided into five broad sections: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; finance and economics; and public and political engagement. The report found that while there had been some progress at state and local government levels, \u201cthere continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the Australian federal parliament, and Australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries; for example, it is one of the world\u2019s largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low-carbon sources is low\u201d. \u201cWe also find significantly increasing exposure of Australians to heatwaves and, in most states and territories, continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures,\u201d wrote the authors, led by Associate Professor Paul Beggs of Macquarie University\u2019s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. \u201cAs a direct result of this failure, we conclude that Australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change, and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this \u2026 This work is urgent.\u201d Spokeswoman for Doctors for the Environment Australia, Dr Arnagretta Hunter, agreed Australia was poorly prepared for the health challenge of climate change. \u201cDoctors around Australia are already seeing multiple health effects from climate change,\u201d Hunter, a cardiologist, said. \u201cOn the coast of NSW this week we know there are more respiratory illnesses, heart attacks and strokes as a consequence of the terrible air pollution from the fires. Doctors see the mental health effects of drought in rural communities. Patterns of infectious diseases are changing. \u201cAverage summer temperatures in Australia have risen by 1.66C in the past 20 years, with the intensity of heatwaves rising by a third. And with the increasing temperatures over summer we know there has been increased hospital admissions with ill health. Mortality rates are also affected.\u201d In 2014, Melbourne experienced temperatures over 41C from 14 to 17 January, as well as 167 excess deaths and a new record set for the highest number of calls for ambulance services ever received in a day, she said. Hunter described Australia as the developed country with the most serious vulnerability to climate change through heat, fire, water shortages and extreme weather events. \u201cDoctors for the Environment Australia joins the loud chorus across Australia calling for the federal government to acknowledge the risk and act in proportion to the magnitude of the threat,\u201d she said. In 2019, the Australian Medical Association, Doctors for the Environment Australia and the World Medical Association recognised climate change as a health emergency. Public Health Association of Australia senior policy officer Dr Ingrid Johnston said the priorities of the fossil fuel industry had been placed ahead of the health of Australians. \u201cNo one can dispute that climate change poses significant immediate, medium-term and long-term risks to the health of Australians and communities around the world,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cAnd yet the government appears to believe that climate change is not a mainstream health issue. This is tragically wrong. The issues cannot be siloed.\u201d She called on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to issue a statement unambiguously acknowledging the link between climate change and health. Johnston said the activities of the federal government\u2019s disaster and climate resilience reference group \u2013 a group of senior officials which considers the risks and opportunities arising from climate change and natural disasters \u2013 had not been transparent in its work. \u201cThe public has a right to know what that working group is doing,\u201d she said. \u201cHow much information is the government giving consideration to regarding climate impacts in national assessments of health? \u201cAustralians are crying out for genuine, smart and empathetic national leadership. The above cannot happen without a well-resourced and national effort to reduce future threat levels from fires and drought.\u201d She said the Public Health Association of Australia wanted a Coag health and climate change forum consisting of ministers with responsibility for health, environment, energy and other portfolios. \u201cNo area is untouched by climate change,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThis Coag working group would incorporate academic expertise on how to adapt the health system to a changing climate with more natural disasters, with adequate funding for proposals. The sniping politics has to stop so we can get on with working for health and the national interest. \u201cFinally, we call out the policy that does exist. It is a policy that places the fossil fuel industry above the health and wellbeing of all Australians. It backs subsidies for fossil fuels and subverts tough environmental planning for mines and gas projects.\u201d General practitioner Dr Peter Tait, who also has a master\u2019s degree in climate change and is involved with health and environmental groups, said there was no mechanism in the national health system to collect information about climate-related illnesses other than in a random or anecdotal way. \u201cEven in emergency departments where the severe end of these conditions go, data collection is dependent on the treating doctor using a code to identify heat stress or natural disaster effects, and apart from the obvious ones, like burns, they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do know that the mental health toll from destructive fires and other natural disasters will be high. This is a supernatural disaster occasioned by decades of purposeful neglect by governments and as that dawns on people, anger and distress will rise.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
