Here\u2019s the story of that incredible night, Foreman\u2019s 10 best knockouts and a documentary on the great man from 2017. 2) That type of player: AFC Totton\u2019s St\u00e9phane Zubar with a none-too-subtle collapse against Thatcham Town. 3) Manchester City and Liverpool meet again at the Etihad on Sunday. Liverpool\u2019s last win at City came in the Champions League in 2018, while their last visit in July saw the newly-crowned champions lose 4-0. Back in 1991, City had a David White double to thank for victory as Dean Saunders missed a penalty. And who can forget this absolute shambles which resulted in City\u2019s relegation from the Premier League? 4) Happy birthday Ellyse Perry. The Australian superstar, arguably the best female cricketer of all time, turned 30 this week and has dominated the sport ever since she burst on the stage as a teenager. Here she is on T20 debut in 2008, aged just 17, teaching England a lesson with bat and ball. Another career highlight includes the double century in the 2017 Ashes. Perry was named one of Wisden\u2019s five cricketers of the last decade and her Ashes spell last year in the third ODI was named Wisden\u2019s second best bowling spell of the decade as she took 7-22 \u2013 the best ODI figures by an Australian woman \u2013 to all but seal the series. Oh, and she\u2019s not bad at football either. Here she is, at the 2011 Women\u2019s World Cup, curling one into the top corner against Sweden. 5) The Europa League has a new challenge: who can score from the furthest out? First, Rangers\u2019 Kemar Roofe whacked one in from his own half, then the following week, ex-Wigan midfielder Jordi G\u00f3mez, now playing for Henning Berg\u2019s Omonia Nicosia, banged in from downtown. Over in Romania, FCSB (Steaua Bucharest in old money) under-19 goalkeeper Mihai Udrea scored from even further out, and then there\u2019s Tom Coles for Biggleswade. 6) Let\u2019s finish with some classic pro-celebrity golf. Here\u2019s Ronnie Corbett getting it done at Moor Park, Glen Campbell at Torrey Pines, Bing Crosby at Pebble Beach and with Bob Hope at Sunningdale. Finally, enjoy Ed Sullivan, Perry Como and Patty Berg at Knollwood Country Club. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Riots and relegation: the tale of Leyton Orient\u2019s fall into non-league. 2) Legendary athletics coach and commentator Ron Pickering on Parkinson. 3) Amid injuries and political protests, favourites USA were unable to compete in the 1972 Olympic 4x400m men\u2019s final. Cue a dramatic battle for gold between Great Britain and Kenya. 4) Another George Best highlight \u2013 a backheel against Benfica that was too cute for his own teammate.
