It's a relic, he explained, from the 1948 Olympic Games. We were at Herne Hill, the open-air velodrome in south London. It was the first week of April this year, the rain had been inundating the shallow bankings of the 120-year-old concrete bowl since late morning, and the annual Good Friday track meeting was about to be cancelled. Inglis, who occupies an important place in the nation's life as the historian of its sporting architecture, is compiling a book about London's various arenas and was there to research his entry on Herne Hill, the last remaining active venue from the 1948 Games. I was there to watch some bike racing. He had better luck, coming away with photographs of the historic drainpipe still doing its job. I ate a water-logged cheeseburger and went home to watch a DVD of Fausto Coppi's greatest races. Now it seems as though the days of Herne Hill's historic Good Friday festival are numbered. Last week it was announced that the event, which dates back to 1903, will be held from next year at Manchester's velodrome, the home of British Cycling's all\u2011conquering track team. Three consecutive years of bad weather, culminating in the total loss of the 2010 meeting, proved too much for the organiser. His patience had already been worn away by the reluctance of the Dulwich Estate, the owner of the freehold, to grant a lease long enough to make it worthwhile to undertake the necessary refurbishment of the grandstand, which is closed for safety reasons, and the 450\u2011metre track itself. But it was here that Reg Harris won the silver medal in the 1,000m sprint at the 1948 Games. Ten years later Coppi attracted a crowd of 12,000 on his only appearance in Britain. It is also the place where the young Bradley Wiggins, destined to become a triple Olympic champion, cut his teeth as a competitor, and among the 500 local children who still use the track on Saturday mornings, under the supervision of the V\u00e9lo Club de Londres, are the Harrises and Wigginses of the future. Few of them mind that it no longer meets the Olympic specification, which calls for a high-banked 250m indoor track. Like Edinburgh's Meadowbank velodrome, a similarly timeworn track saved from immediate closure a couple of years ago after a campaign fronted by Sir Chris Hoy, this is the kind of place that can still inspire the next generation of champions. A campaign to save Herne Hill is being run by local people who recognise that they have a potentially superb amenity in their midst. They may have lost the Good Friday meeting, at least for now, but their long-term vision is a broader one. \"It's not just about keeping the place open,\" Hillary Peachey, one of the organisers, told me yesterday. \"We're looking at the longer-term prospects of redeveloping the site to create a velo park, with a caf\u00e9, a BMX track and other facilities.\" Peachey, whose two young children use the track at weekends, speaks of acquiring charitable status, getting local schools involved, pitching for Lottery funding and drawing up the sort of plans that would persuade the Dulwich Estate to give them a 25-year lease. \"Here's an opportunity to encourage kids to get healthier,\" she said. \"It's a perfect example of what David Cameron's Big Society is supposed to be about.\" The relevant website is www.savethevelodrome.com and there will be a public meeting at the nearby Dulwich College on 6 October. They hope to get Wiggins along, or at least to receive his endorsement. And the opposing argument that a gleaming new Olympic-spec velodrome will be ready for general use on the north side of London after 2012 won't wash in a city with a population of 7.5 million, an ever increasing number of whom are taking to two wheels. The Olympic legacy is not supposed to be a zero-sum game and the Austerity Games of 1948 deserve their legacy, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
