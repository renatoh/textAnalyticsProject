This image of the \"missing link\" haunted the imagination of a clever, confident schoolboy in Holland in the 1870s. Eugene Dubois decided to do something about it. That meant finding a fossil which revealed the point at which a man-like ape became an ape-like man. And find it he did, in a scientific triumph that never quite brought him the acclaim he thought he deserved. Pat Shipman's fine biography is a thoughtful account of how high achievement can be marked by human frailty, and how science can test a man's character to near destruction. Dubois determined that the best place for old bones would be in the tropics, and quit Holland to work as a military surgeon in the Dutch East Indies. Ultimately, in Java, he unearthed his prize. It was not much - a thigh bone, a tooth and the top of a skull. But for Dubois, it was the ultimate proof of evolution. But if bones could be found in the colony, they could only be turned into knowledge back in Europe. For all that he endured in Java, from bouts of malaria to the death of a child and the beginnings of estrangement from his wife, it was when he came home that the trouble started. His fellow scientists behaved as scientists will, and challenged his evidence. Dubois' certainty was unwavering, but fossil evidence is always open to reinterpretation, and it drove him almost to distraction. Shipman certainly admires the man, but is clear-eyed about his faults. Brilliant, irascible, intolerant of criticism, paranoid and obsessive, he fought hard but erratically to establish his Pithecanthropus erectus as a real species, intermediate beween apes and humans. Even though he gradually convinced all but a few fellow researchers about the Javanese finds, nowadays dubbed Homo erectus, Dubois ended his life a sad figure, reduced to browbeating assistants and groping the housekeeper. But for all that, dammit, he really did discover the missing link.JT Darwin's Audubon: Science and the Liberal Imagination by Gerald Weissmann (Perseus, \u00a312.99) A medical professor, Gerald Weissmann admits his essays on science and culture \"may seem quaint compared to the trendy tilts of our new Unreason\". He has sharp words for \"cultural rock-stars like Foucault and Derrida\", but more surprising are those for the equally trendy advocates of selfish genes and sociobiology. Although he believes passionately in \"progress through reason\", science is no excuse \"for undoing the notion of equality\". He shares Auden's fear \"that from Urban Man / By advertising, plus the aid / Of drugs, an insect might be made\". Weissmann ranges effortlessly from Goethe to Graves and from Buffon to Bragg (William not Melvyn), weaving together current biology with literature and history. It's a sad fact that from 1847 \"no British youth has been taught both art and science\" at university. Brimming with insights, this should be on every fresher's reading list.PDS"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
