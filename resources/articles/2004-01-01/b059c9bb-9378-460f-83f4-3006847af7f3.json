McCoy was riding Deano's Beeno, a horse known for its difficult temperament, in the Unicoin New Homes Spa Hurdle at Cheltenham, and repeatedly struck his mount while trying to manoeuvre into position before the race had started. Deano's Beeno ran in snatches before fading close to home and finishing fourth behind Sh Boom. After the race McCoy was immediately called to the stewards' room for an explanation before being handed the ban, which will run from January 12 to 16. The stipendary steward at Cheltenham, William Nunneley, described McCoy's actions as \"clearly unacceptable\". An angry McCoy was reluctant to comment as he left the stewards' room. \"What am I supposed to do?\" he said. Ironically, the ban comes on a horse with whom McCoy has enjoyed considerable success, most notably when winning last year's Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot from Baracouda."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
