F\u00e1bregas is resigned to leaving the Camp Nou after three seasons back at the Catalan club and is available for \u00a330m, with Bar\u00e7a intent on prising Koke from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to kickstart Luis Enrique\u2019s tenure as their new manager. With Arsenal having indicated they will not take up their option to re-sign their former captain, and Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool having prioritised strengthening other areas of their teams, the 27-year-old\u2019s desire to return to the Premier League can only be satisfied with a move to Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, has confirmed his interest in securing F\u00e1bregas and has acknowledged that he is seeking a transfer back to England, where he made his name over eight seasons at Arsenal. The Portuguese has already lost one midfielder after Frank Lampard\u2019s departure under freedom of contract. \u201cWe have some interest [in F\u00e1bregas],\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cI have interest in analysing the situation. \u201cI think it looks like he\u2019s really interested in leaving Barcelona and is very, very interested in coming back to England. This, I think, is clear. There is a process where he wants to leave, [and] he wants to come to England because it\u2019s the country where he wants to be, where he prefers to play. We are interested in monitoring the situation.\u201d The midfielder is currently preparing for the World Cup with the Spain squad in Washington, where they play El Salvador on Saturday before travelling to Brazil 24 hours later. He would ideally like his future to be determined before the national team begin their defence of the trophy against Holland on 13 June. A firm bid from Chelsea would force Arsenal to reiterate that they do not wish to take up their option but, while F\u00e1bregas is disappointed his former club are not keen to pursue his signature, he is open to a return to London despite previously enduring a rather fractious relationship with Mourinho. The deal appears relatively easily resolved given the player\u2019s availability. Indeed, Fernando Torres, who is also in the Spain squad, believes his national team-mate would become a \u201cleader\u201d in the dressing room at Stamford Bridge with Lampard\u2019s departure, along with that of Ashley Cole this summer, creating a void. \u201cWould Cesc be a great signing? Great players are always great signings,\u201d said Torres. \u201cHe\u2019s a type of player Chelsea don\u2019t have now. Cesc knows the Premier League, he can add football, possession, goals if he feels important. He can be a leader, like he was at Arsenal.\u201d Mourinho is close to agreeing the \u00a332m signing of the Atl\u00e9tico striker Diego Costa, with the Brazil-born Spain international having passed a medical organised by Chelsea, and hope to follow that with the signing of his team-mate, Filipe Luis, to replace Cole at left-back. The veteran heard the news he was to be released after the club made a phone call to his agent and Mourinho has admitted that he has not yet spoken to the player, who is a little surprised at the way his departure has been handled after eight years' service. \"With Lampard, I spoke a couple of weeks before the end of the league,\" Mourinho said. \"With Ashley, I didn't have that chance. And different situations. I want to see what is going on, what is going to happen. I need to. But I will speak to him.\" Cole was the controversial omission from Roy Hodgson's England squad for the World Cup finals, with the England manager taking into account his lack of regular football for Chelsea over the season. With Cesar Azpilicueta in fine form, Mourinho often found that he could not work a space for Cole. \"I have no regrets because I don't work for the national team,\" Mourinho said, with regard to Cole's World Cup exclusion. \"I work for Chelsea and the decisions I make, I always make thinking about the club, the team and the players come after. In the last part of the season, Cole showed how good he is because he had to play a Champions League semi-final against Atletico Madrid after not playing for a very long time. He played with great stability to the team. \"After that, I keep him in the team and I push him to get a World Cup position. He played really well. Mr Hodgson could easily see he was in perfect condition. After that comes the option and it's an option I respect. He can choose who he wants and he chose [Leighton] Baines and [Luke] Shaw. It is his decision and not a single criticism of that. But Ashley was in condition to play.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
