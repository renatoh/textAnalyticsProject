Although Lampard stressed Loftus-Cheek remains part of his long-term plans, he said the 24-year-old could benefit from a loan move after leaving him out of Chelsea\u2019s last three match-day squads. Aston Villa, Southampton and West Ham are among several clubs monitoring the England international, who has found opportunities hard to come by since recovering from his injury. Alonso, meanwhile, felt Lampard\u2019s wrath after he tried to watch the second half of the game at the Hawthorns from the team coach rather than with the other substitutes. The Spaniard had been taken off after 45 minutes. with Chelsea trailing 3-0, and went to the team coach without his manager\u2019s permission. Alonso, who has been at Chelsea since 2016, will now have to work hard to regain his manager\u2019s trust and may yet leave before the transfer window closes on 5 October. Regarding Loftus-Cheek, Lampard said: \u201cI\u2019m very open with Ruben. We\u2019ve had a couple of conversations in the last week. He\u2019s fit as a fiddle so he can play week in, week out. He needs to play. He\u2019s done a lot of work now. He would have been playing earlier if it wasn\u2019t for lockdown and restart. There\u2019s a possibility that Ruben may go out to play games because that would be great for him. \u201cWe hold him in very high regard. I certainly do and that could be a good option for him. If that\u2019s not the right option he\u2019ll be competitive in this squad as well. I\u2019m relaxed about it but I want to find the best path for Ruben and I want to find the best path for us.\u201d Loftus-Cheek, who needs game time to win a place in England\u2019s squad for the European Championship next summer, has struggled since sustaining his injury in May 2019. His rehabilitation was disrupted by lockdown and he failed to impress after being handed a rare start when Chelsea visited Brighton on the opening weekend of the season. Lampard could hand Loftus-Cheek another chance when Chelsea visit Tottenham in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday. Chelsea have plenty of competition for places in attacking midfield and Lampard feels that a temporary move could help the academy graduate kickstart his career. \u201cHe\u2019s had a difficult time,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThe injury was a bad one. He hasn\u2019t played as many minutes for this club as he would have liked for different reasons. Just before his injury he was playing really well and contributing. I was always looking forward to him getting back fit and working with him. \u201cHe wants to play and the reality is I have a lot of competition in those areas. Ruben is versatile. He can play different roles in the midfield and sometimes off the side, so I was really looking forward to working with him because I know what he can do. He gives us something slightly different in terms of his physicality. But there is also a priority for everyone that Ruben plays games. We\u2019ll do what feels right.\u201d Chelsea are expected to make an opening bid for West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice this week. However, West Ham are adamant that the defensive midfielder is not for sale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
