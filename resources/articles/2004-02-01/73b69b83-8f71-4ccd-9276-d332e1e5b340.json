It was the first day of my \"mahout\" (elephant driver) course at the Anantara resort and spa in the golden triangle. Disco Inferno, our 26-year-old, two-tonne charge, was simply nowhere to be found. Crashing around in 160 hectares of misty jungle at 6.30am with Khun Nan, the professional mahout, I couldn't believe he had lost her. It was perplexing, how do you find an elephant? And so began lesson one in driving an elephant: remember where you parked the night before. After mistaking a tree trunk for an elephant trunk, blaming the early hour and contact lenses, we finally found the mischievous and sleepy elephant. She emerged from the treetops with a trumpet, curious about this blonde, dwarfish figure before her and keen to snack on the sugar cane shoots and juicy bamboo tips we had brought for her breakfast. There are four elephants at the Anantara elephant village, including Disco. They originally worked in mining and logging, but were \"checked in\" to Anantara in September 2003, having been acquired from the Thai Elephant Conservation Centre. Elephants, like humans, have distinct personalities and a wide range of emotions: from grumpy to downright giddy. The personalities in the Anantara group are distinct: there is the eldest Pang Yom (the wise matriarch); Tantawan and Champen, inseparable and best friends from logging; and Lawann (Disco Inferno), the cheeky elephant teenager who is an all-night rager, hence the nickname. Like any teenager, Disco was mischievous, slightly unpredictable and something of a flirt. Dancing was her forte. Lacing her trunk around my wrist, she would then fling me away, while I twirled obligingly - it was difficult to know who was having the most fun, until I was warned that a moment of distraction from Disco could break my delicate bones in two. She wouldn't mean to, but it was prudent to remember that this teenager weighed two tonnes. The school is the only one of its type for tourists and is modelled on the professional mahout training camp at Lampang's conservation centre. The nature ranger John Roberts, formerly an engineer in England, explains that it is the only chance for people to become well acquainted with elephants in a natural setting. Guests learn to bathe their elephants, find a good sleeping spot where food is plentiful, and drive them using mahout commands. Guests can also trek and explore the resort grounds. Sadly, a thorn had punctured Tantawan's foot and she had suffered a 'blow out\", so she was out of commission. But John gathered the remaining trio of elephants and, together with the other two guests, we walked back to the training arena for shower time. Elephants only sweat in one place - above their toenails - and they love to be hosed. With the mahouts, we set about washing off the caked mud and checking for any overnight injuries. We discussed the texture of the skin, which is a thick hide that feels like prickly vinyl: interesting, but not something you would choose for your car. After being squirted with water (did someone mention \"playful\") and enjoying a cup of green tea in bamboo cups from the mahout campfire, it was time to get aboard. Lesson two in driving an elephant: mounting. Elephants are ... big, and there are two ways to get aboard. One is much like climbing a tree: the elephant offers a foot, then you grab a rope and clamber up the side to get to the driver's seat. The other involves launching yourself on to her head. I chose the second, slightly more exciting option. First, as if pushing an elevator button, press on her nose to lower the trunk and head. Take a run-up, and make a flying leap on to the head. Hold on to trunk, nose, whatever, because the head then rises, taking you with it, and if all goes well you don't fall off. You find yourself in the driver's seat, admittedly facing backwards, but a quick shuffle has you facing the front and ready to go for a test drive. Sitting up high with my legs behind her big, flappy ears, I felt comfortable despite the lack of climate control, seat belt or airbags. I learned the basic commands: stop (\"how\", leg squeeze); go (\"pai\", one kick); and reverse (rocking and \"sock\"). Trying to mimic the mahout's Thai inflection on \"sock\", I was delighted when Disco obligingly started to reverse ... towards the mahout quarters. Oops. One kick and a \"pai\" later, we were heading back towards the training arena. Sessions run for two hours in the early mornings and evenings. So our first task was to drive back to the hotel restaurant, park our elephant at the hotel foyer, dismount (\"hab soong\"), and enjoy a hot breakfast on a leafy terrace overlooking Burma. This programme leaves you free during the day to take boat trips down the Mekong. You can cycle, hike, cross to Burma or Laos, or simply soak up the sun in the surrounds of the five-star resort. There is also the ancient city of Chiang Saen, an important trading post where the Burmese, Laotian and Thai cultures merge. People from indigenous hill tribes, including the famous \"stretched neck\" Paduang women, bring their produce to the city's markets. The resort itself is tranquil and luxurious. All rooms have a view of three countries and the spa treatments are famous. Initially, the elephants want to follow the mahout. Over three days, however, a bond is built between you and your elephant, and that is the main objective of the course. The lasting impression of the camp is one of affection between the guests and the mahouts, who spend weeks away from their families at a time. The native mahouts, upon first seeing Ranger John's pre-loved Range Rover, stood in a circle, giggling and telling it to \"sock\". It was all, of course, good-natured teasing. As you walk through the forest, you are serenaded by the mahouts singing, mostly using the word \"pai\" as they gently coax their charges onwards. On the last day, your elephant meets you at the hotel. You drive her unaided through the forest to visit a Buddhist shrine with a view across the Mekong River to Burma and Laos. A hot breakfast awaits and you are presented with your licence to drive. An elephant mahout licence may not be a vital life skill or valuable addition to a resum\u00e9. But riding astride an elephant is not only a productive way to support ecotourism; it is also a unique way to get off the beaten track in Thailand and make a friend who is distinctly larger-than-life.
