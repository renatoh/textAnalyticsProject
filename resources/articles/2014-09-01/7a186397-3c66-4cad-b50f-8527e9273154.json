Its new larger screened phones will principally chase users in its two biggest markets: China and the US \u2013 but also gives it the weapons to compete directly with Android handset makers who staked a claim to large-screened handsets years earlier. While the iPhone\u2019s screen crept up from 3.5in (measured diagonally) to 4in in 2012 with the launch of the iPhone 5, other manufacturers \u2013 notably their chief rival Samsung \u2013 have been pushing first above 4.5in and then over 5in and 5.5in. Consumers clearly want bigger screens. In the US, RBC Capital Markets in June found that 35% of people who would not otherwise consider a new iPhone would do so for a larger screen. Kantar Research also found that screen size was the most important element of the phone design in driving users\u2019 choices, cited by 42%. Apple is playing catch-up to Android handset makers, which began offering larger screens years ago in response to strong demand in Asia, as well as to differentiate themselves from Apple. That gave them some crucial leverage: an internal presentation from Apple, presented as evidence by Samsung in a trial over patents, showed executives concerned in April 2013 that \u201cconsumers want what we don\u2019t have\u201d \u2013 larger-screened phones. Jana, which surveys consumers in Africa and Asia, points out that since 2007 the average size of a smartphone screen has grown from 2.6in to 4.86in. But for Apple\u2019s slow approach to introducing a larger screen, that average would be larger; Apple shipped 13.5% of all smartphones in the first half of 2014, and most were 4in, with a significant proportion being the older iPhone 4 and 4S, with 3.5in screens. (BlackBerry, which still offers 3in screens on older BB7 phones, was 0.4% of smartphone shipments in the first half of the year.) Bigger is preferred. Over half the respondents in a recent survey in emerging economies including Kenya and Vietnam expected their next smartphone to have a screen over 5in. Samsung in particular has a powerful position in the so-called \u201cphablet\u201d (phone-tablet) market, defined variously as phones with screens over 5in or 5.5in (the precise definition varies between research companies). From the first Galaxy Note, introduced in 2011 with a then-gigantic 5.3in screen, to the latest Galaxy Note 4, with a 5.7in screen, Samsung has dominated the space, with an estimated 14% of the installed base of the rapidly growing segment. Samsung intends to retain that status despite challenges from China\u2019s Huawei and Xiaomi: speaking at IFA last week, the executive vice-president of its mobile business, Lee Young-hee, said: \u201cWe have both the originality and leadership in the global market\u2019s high-end segment for large-screened smartphones, though many other smartphone manufacturers, including Apple, are increasingly looking into this segment \u2026 With our long-accumulated experience and know-how in related technologies such as multi-tasking control and digital pen-writing, I believe we can maintain our leadership.\u201d For Samsung, that could be crucial: profits at its electronics division dipped in the second quarter, along with smartphone shipments, and Apple\u2019s entrance into this space will test brand loyalty. Phablets will become an increasingly important part of the phone market, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). In a forecast this month it says that this year more phablets will be sold than laptop computers worldwide, 175m against 170m \u2013 and that in 2015, the number will hit 318m, outdistancing 233m tablets. (IDC defines a phablet as a phone with a screen between 5.5in and 7in.) In the context of the smartphone market, which is expected to hit 1.2bn this year, 5.5in+ \u201cphablets\u201d will be just under 15% of shipments. But more and more phones have screens larger than 5in, an alternative definition of \u201cphablet\u201d. For Apple, which sees China as a gigantic market to be tapped, larger-screened phones are certain to drive many extra sales, even over the number it already has: China is reckoned to have around 120m iPhone users \u2013 making it the the largest \u2013 more than the US, which has about 74m according to data from July from ComScore. The biggest point in Apple\u2019s favour, though, is that it can use its larger-screened phones to appeal to two groups: existing iPhone customers wanting something bigger and users of Android phones whose key consideration is screen size. \u2022 Charles Arthur\u2019s travel and accommodation was paid for by Apple.
