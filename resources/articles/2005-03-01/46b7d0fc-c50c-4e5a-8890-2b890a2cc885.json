Sir Peter Mason, the company's chief executive, said he was keen to \"recycle\" money from different parts of the business so it could be put to work elsewhere. The move reflects the growing value of PPP and private finance initiative portfolios, which have grabbed the attention of the City as political and other risks are considered to have diminished. The Amec assets had a book value of \u00a342m but are now valued inside the firm at \u00a377m - lower than the valuation on similar holdings given this week by rivals Carillion and Balfour Beatty. Sir Peter said this was because of higher \"discount rates\" of 10.5% used in Amec calculations. Using the 10% used by its rivals would bump the total value up to \u00a385m. He said the company aimed to increase earnings from this portfolio possibly \"from the sale of its investments\". Asked whether this could include Calderdale, Sir Peter said: \"Yes it could - but there are no plans for that now.\" He rejected criticism about the hospital, which had been hit by a range of teething problems that were picked up by unions and used in a campaign against PPPs \"for no good reason\". The Amec boss was talking as he announced a 5% increase in pre-tax profits to \u00a3118.1m on turnover up 2.2% at \u00a34.8bn. The company, which has moved from construction to the support services sector of the London stock market, saw an 8% increase in operating profits from its largest business, engineering and technical services. It is hoping to take advantage of the opening up of the nuclear industry to private firms in Britain after April and has already undertaken politically sensitive work in Iraq. Amec has won $730m (\u00a3370m) worth of reconstruction business there alongside US partner Fluor but admits that progress has been slow. Following the \"lockdown\" around the Iraqi elections, Amec says things are now improving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
