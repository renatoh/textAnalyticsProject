There are those whose antipathy towards him far outweighs any preference for Europe over America. It was ever thus. This battle between the golfing Press and the greatest post-war British golfer goes back to his third Open win at Muirfield and his giving thanks to the golf writers from the 'heart of his bottom'. There seems to be a quirk in the national character that cannot help rubbing up against the quirks in character of the national hero to create a deep and lasting incompatibility. Here in Kentucky, and 16 years on, battle has been recommenced. Once again Faldo has been playing it for laughs. He has always considered himself to be a humourist of some distinction. Two things stand out from an interview with him awhile ago. First, he banged on about Lee Trevino having being built up by the press as a comedian, the heavy implication being that Faldo was funnier than the Tex-Mexican. Second was him seeming to consider his career highlight to be not the six majors he won but the American golfer Peter Jacobson describing him 'as the funniest Englishman since John Cleese'. A compliment that would have been heftier had it come from Howard not Peter and at a time when Cleese was actually funny. But, hey, a good review is a good review. On Thursday during the opening ceremony he was at it again, with magnificent inappropriateness pulling out a 40-minute set that might as well have concluded with 'My name's Nick Faldo. You've been wonderful. Good night, Kentucky'. It was not all bad. His joke about not having learned from his parents' 61-year marriage was gracious and appropriate. His line about Padraig Harrington having hit more practice shots than there are potatoes in Ireland less so. Alongside the attempted jokes on Thursday, there was the mawk. His comments about his children being particularly excruciating. His son Matthew was praised for his good looks, which he had been lucky enough to acquire from you know who? Oldest daughter Natalie, we were informed, was working in Hollywood, taking on the film world, and we should expect a film by Natalie Faldo to be on our screens. No working through the ranks for Natalie, she goes straight from amateur to auteur. We were further informed that Georgia was taking on the fashion industry. Finally, we were told that apple of his eye, five-year-old Emily, presumably taking on the Abba revival industry, was a shoo-in for the main role should they remake Mamma Mia. All those Faldos, all taking on the world. Christmas must be exhausting. Every bit of the above, scarcely credibly, was delivered in between speeches of deadening inevitability from PGA blazers relentless remarking upon the numbers of professional golfers they have in their organisation. It was as if a Rotary lunch had been overtaken by a society wedding, with Faldo making all the speeches. There are three core facts about Faldo. He is an only child. He had his first argument aged 25. And, at his first wedding, his best man was his agent. All of which, if it is what is required to be a champion, is fair enough. And all of which needs to be taken on board when trying to understand him. 'The Champ's a bit odd' is hardly news. This week, however, the Champ has not just being behaving oddly, he has been behaving bizarrely. In poker terms, he is on tilt. And no one, least of all him one suspects, knows what is going to happen next. All we know is that he is having the time of his life because he keeps telling us so. Faldo's behaviour was at its tiltiest when he talked about meeting Muhammad Ali. As he recalled this 'meeting of champs' he even went so far as to point at his crocodile tears to show how genuine they were. The press thought he was being erratic, he knew he was ecstatic. There has been a 'born-again' aspect to Faldo's captaincy. The individual who, at the rather late age of 51, has suddenly discovered the fun of being one of the team - as long, of course, as you are No 1 on the team. Welcome to the Church of Faldo. In his final sermon before the off, we were given insights into the full weirdness of this strange sect. 'This is the most special moment, week of my life right now, and we haven't even started yet,' he gushed. 'Greatest weakness? Probably the cookies and the brownies,' he duff joked. And then came the slightly barking sandwich analogy. 'If you see cheese next to your name you'll play all five, tuna means four matches, chicken is three matches, OK, and lettuce is two. Let us begin.' The transcript continues: '(No laughter).' Being a Ryder Cup captain is not as difficult as many would have you believe. Jack Nicklaus said earlier this year that he couldn't for the life of him see why you might need assistants because all you had to do is ask people who they would like to play with, write down their names and tell them to go out and play. You are dealing with the best golfers in the world and all you are asking them to do is play golf. The captain picks the team and from then on it is up to others. 'The captain's job is an important one but also a limited one,' said Justin Rose after his second victory. He is primarily a selector and, for all his erratic behaviour, no one could argue with Faldo's opening-day selections. It was then that he got unlucky. Friday was a topsy-turvy day with each game's progress resembling a sine chart as the advantage ebbed and flowed. The winners were those who happened to be ahead when the curtain came down. If Justin Rose and Ian Poulter had closed out their three-up lead against Stewart Cink and Chad Campbell. If Padraig Harrington had closed out both of the three-up leads he had over the Phil Mickelson and Anthony Kim pairing instead of halving one and losing the other. And if these three 'ifs' had turned into 'ands' Europe would have been leading 5-3 after the first day instead of trailing 5\u00bd-2\u00bd. And everyone would have been talking about Faldo the great captain. But they didn't and they aren't. Particularly when they got wind of his truly eccentric Saturday selections. He had dropped Sergio Garc\u00eda (foursomes record: won eight, halved one). And he had dropped Lee Westwood, who had just equaled Arnie Palmer's unbeaten streak in Ryder Cup matches. He had dropped these two Titans in order to accommodate Oliver Wilson, who was assumed to be earmarked to play only on Sunday and therefore, to use Faldo's sandwich analogy, to be sub-lettuce. This selection seemed to be totally Ben Curtis Strange. There was even discussion as to whether Faldo, given his penchant for taking on the world, was arranging things so that Europe would go into the final day with such a deficit that they could attempt to out-Brookline the American effort in 1999. And, more darkly, talk that the insult to Westwood following on from his refusal to pick Darren Clarke seemed to be motivated more by egotism rather than sense. It's all about me, me, me in the Church of Faldo. How wrong the doubters were. The decision to select Oliver Wilson proved to be inspired as, alongside Henrik Stenson, he recovered from four down to beat the American marquee pair at the seventeenth. Faldo was standing at the 18th when he heard the news and he greeted it with a little punch and two thumbs up to the team. The pastor had been vindicated. He received further proof of his wisdom when minutes later Graeme McDowell made the putt that ensured Europe won yesterday's foursomes. It was a vital half achieved against Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan - the Prince Andrew lookalike meets the unthinking woman's Hal Sutton - who were Azinger's other go-to pairing. Faldo had got away with it and rested some key players who would be a whole load fresher, and presumably angrier, when they returned for yesterday's four balls. The strategy did not quite work. Just because Westwood is so phlegmatic, it does not mean he isn't sensitive. He suffered most from his captain's whims. The decision was not mutual and it was capricious for Faldo to end his streak in the selection room. If Westwood was angry it did not help him and his attempt to break Palmer's record was scotched by a slack-jawed yokel called Boo and his mate JB. Garc\u00eda, too, could have been more thrilled. He, too, did not benefit from his enforced rest and together with Paul Casey secured only a half from a game that looked a point Europe would need. On the plus side, his Swedes did him proud and there was a lovely moment when Westwood heard that Robert Karlsson had pinged a fourth consecutive birdie while sitting by the 17th and punched the air. He may not have agreed with his contrary captain, but he is too big a man to hold a grudge. And then, and decisively, the European who has made the biggest impact has been the player for whom Faldo received the most criticism for selecting. The man Justin Rose called yesterday 'the fat kid from Milton Keynes' and Faldo, presumably for comedic purposes, calls Raquel. Ian Poulter has been, as they say, immense since blowing a lead on the first morning. His three consecutive victories have given Europe a chance this afternoon. Without the captain's favourite they would be big outsiders. And if Faldo and Raquel do prevail tonight expect there to be more nuptials, with the captain once again making all the speeches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
