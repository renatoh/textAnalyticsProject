Newmarket 2.20 A last chance is given to Emerald Wilderness, who is on a fair mark. York 2.35 Spouk is the one with potential, but she may just make the market for Summer Gold, who is more exposed but looked to be running into form last time out and is well-handicapped. Ascot 2.40 Clive Brittain's Jira came from last to first to beat Jeanie Johnston at Newmarket in June and, at this trip and on the same terms, should have her beating again. Lady Of The Desert, sixth behind the extraordinary Jealous Again at the Royal meeting, is the each-way value. Newmarket 2.50 The progressive Hunterview did not appreciate Chester but should find this track more amenable. York 3.10 Frankie Dettori goes to the Knavesmire rather than his beloved Ascot to ride Kirklees, which is a tip in itself. The five-year-old is not that far clear on the figures, but has a solid profile and should come on for his belated seasonal debut, too. Ascot 3.15 Desert Creek failed to progress as expected when poorly drawn at the Royal meeting, but remains the horse in this field with the most potential. Newmarket 3.25 Adoring was impressive on her debut but Victoria Sponge will be a tough opponent back at seven furlongs. York 3.40 A sprint handicap that is as fascinating as it is impenetrable, but David Nicholls's string is in good form, and Striking Spirit has an excellent front-running jockey in Micky Fenton. Ascot 3.50 At least half a dozen are well ahead of their mark, but Captain Brilliance and Secret Society have mainly raced on fast ground and preference is for Roaring Forte. Horse sense Desert Creek (3.15), who has been the subject of good reports since his unplaced effort from a poor draw in the Britannia Handicap at Royal Ascot, is the one to be on back at the track this afternoon. The International Stakes which follows is a wide-open affair and our three against the field are Captain Brilliance (3.50), who has been in good form since finishing runner-up in the Bunbury Cup at Newmarket's July meeting, Racer Forever, for whom there is a good word in Newmarket, and Genki, who is right back to his best as his stable start to click into gear. Connections consider Lady Of The Desert (2.40) was made too much use of at the Royal meeting and she will be well fancied to make amends today in the Princess Margaret Stakes while Ralph Beckett's good record with juveniles could be underlined with Invincible Prince (2.00) The opener at Newmarket this afternoon contains a number of interesting runners. Lost Cause has been doing all the right things at home ahead of his debut, while Rasselas will come on for his first run. Timely Jazz has improved for his recent second in what looked a useful maiden. Peter Chapple-Hyam should have a welcome two-year-old winner in San Jemeniano (4.00), who has certainly benefited from his debut. At York La Coveta (2.35) is expected to put up a bold show, while Tazeez (3.10) should not be disgraced in the highlight on the card, the Group Two Sky Bet Stakes. Mark Johnston's Loveinthesand (4.15) is definitely one to take note of at this fixture. At Salisbury this evening Present Alchemy (7.35), who is coming to hand after two career runs so far, is well worth a look in the three-year-old maiden race and Deloria (7.05) is strongly fancied to open her account by connections. Three two-year-olds who are exciting our gallops contacts are Quadrille (2.15) at Ascot on Sunday, and on Wednesday, Nimue (4.35) at Goodwood and Azmeel (6.55) at Sandown. Seen and heard Nicky Henderson may have had his troubles but one of the Queen's trainers is in favour, as we can report that Michael Bell has been sent another couple of two-year-olds by her majesty. Tactician, by Bell's Derby winner Motivator, and Playground should be seen out later this year. Ayr racecourse, which has had its fair share of crises lately culminating in the seven-horse pile-up at the track earlier this month, is turning to an old-hand in the shape of ex-clerk of the course Mark Kershaw who, we understand, will be working for the Scottish track on a consultancy basis. More a case of not seen and not heard. Why does it take so long for At The Races to air the result and starting prices after a race has finished? Also, they often go to a break before informing viewers what price the winner has obliged at. John McCririck, working for ATR at Ascot yesterday, must be pulling his hair out. Tip of the day Knot In Wood 3.45 York Trainer Richard Fahey likes to mop up the valuable handicaps at York and relies on his old warrior Knot In Wood in the Sky Bet Dash. This seven-year-old showed he was no back number by taking his first Group event at Newcastle in June, before a good fourth in the Scottish Stewards' Cup eight days ago. He looks sure to go well at a venue he likes and is good each-way value at 12-1.
