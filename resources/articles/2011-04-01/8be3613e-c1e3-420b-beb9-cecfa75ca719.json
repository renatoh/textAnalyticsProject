As the text made clear, she died in hospital 36 hours after being shot (Gang members get life for murder of schoolgirl, 13 April, page 12). \u2022 A front-page story about the capture of Laurent Gbagbo said that, in their assault on the former president's residence in Abidjan, his opponents were \"backed by French tanks\". French forces in the Ivory Coast conflict are using lighter armoured vehicles. A recent editorial reminder circulated by the readers' editor noted: \"Not everything with a very large gun that moves is a tank\" (With French help and a slap, Gbagbo is prised from bunker, 12 April, page 1). \u2022 Homophone corner: \"Retail banking ... is an essential service for most people and should not be the root to riches\" (Once again, not enough, 12 April, page 28)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
