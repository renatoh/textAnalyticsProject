Most managers have come here on the back foot. They\u2019re not coming in here smiling, on top of it, really positive because they have nearly always been trying to put out the bush fires, to stop things getting worse all the time. I can see that.\u201d If there have been damaging fault lines inside the boardroom there are clearly deep flaws in the dressing room with the team narrowly escaping relegation in each of the past four seasons. Moyes is braced for another struggle to stay out of the Championship but believes it is largely down to the players to break this dismal cycle. \u201cWe\u2019re up against it, undoubtedly. But I have got to say, the players here need to lift their levels because for too long it\u2019s been too close to the bottom level. \u201cThey need to show that this is not their level because maybe soon people might say it\u2019s got nothing to do with the managers here, maybe it\u2019s got something to do with the players. The players have to lift their levels for us to be competitive.\u201d Following the dispiriting 3-0 home defeat by Everton on Monday night Sunderland \u2013 who have only one point from four games this season \u2013 appear to have their work cut out at White Hart Lane. At least Lamine Kon\u00e9, the Ivorian central defender coveted by Everton, has signed a new five-year contract following a summer when he appeared desperate to depart Wearside. \u201cIn truth, Lamine Kon\u00e9\u2019s situation took an awful lot of focus away from both me and the chief executive, Martin Bain, during the transfer window,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cBut it was worth it because he\u2019s a good player, we need him. But he\u2019s now gone to a level [of remuneration] where he has to become a leader \u2013 he has to become a top player. We need him to perform at a really high level now.\u201d Last season Kon\u00e9, the German midfielder Jan Kirchhoff, who has just recovered from injury, and the Tunisia winger Wahbi Khazri were Allardyce\u2019s \u201cSpecial K\u2019s\u201d. The trio signed in January and played a pivotal part in the avoidance of relegation but since then Khazri\u2019s form and fitness appear to have deserted him. \u201cKhazri came back a bit later than the others this summer and his conditioning was down,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cHis conditioning\u2019s looking better now but my biggest concern is that he needs to keep the ball better. That\u2019s something I have simply not yet seen from him. He\u2019s a player we definitely need and we want him to make difference on the pitch but, if he plays, he has got to keep the ball.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
