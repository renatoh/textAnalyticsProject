Lampard described the reports in relation to the Chelsea job as an \u201ceasy link\u201d given the 13 years he spent there as a player and insisted that now was not the time to talk at length on that subject. He pointed to the fact that Maurizio Sarri, whose position has been under scrutiny for some time, is the Chelsea manager, and said his focus is solely on trying to lead Derby to promotion to the Premier League in the \u00a3170m showdown at Wembley. Irrespective of the outcome of that game, Lampard will sit down with Morris to discuss where the club go next, with the Derby manager fully aware that defeat would leave them in a difficult position. Five key players are out of contract and three influential loan signings \u2013 Harry Wilson, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori \u2013 are scheduled to return to their parent clubs. The biggest issue, however, could be Lampard himself, with the 40-year-old believed to be the leading contender to take over at Stamford Bridge if Sarri departs. \u201cFirstly, I find it quite difficult because they\u2019ve got a game coming up,\u201d Lampard said, referring to Chelsea\u2019s Europa League final against Arsenal on Wednesday. \u201cMore importantly for me, we\u2019ve got a game coming up before that. And also they have a manager, in Sarri, who is trying to get them to win that final. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of an obvious link all season. If I say it is maybe because of where we\u2019re at in the final, and we\u2019re being talked about, and we\u2019ve had a good year, and then I get linked because of my 13 years at the club. I understand the link. \u201cBut in terms of how I\u2019m seeing it, I don\u2019t want to think about it. I want to talk about Monday, I want to work with the team, I want to get this over the line for us. \u201cI\u2019ve got two years left on my contract here and I see no further than Monday. I will sit down with Mel after the game, which was planned before all this [Chelsea] talk anyway, to see firstly what the result was on Monday, because that\u2019s going to be defining how we chat, and to see where the club goes forward. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Asked whether he could ever say no if Chelsea offered him the job, Lampard replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question because it\u2019s a headline. When I started out in management people said: \u2018Your dream must be to be Chelsea manager.\u2019 It\u2019s an easy link. \u201cMy dream was to do as well as I can day in and day out, to be successful. I can\u2019t call that one [the Chelsea job]. Those things happen or they don\u2019t. My focus is completely on the here and now.\u201d Lampard, who will be up against, among others, John Terry, the Villa assistant head coach and a former Chelsea teammate, said he would not be seeking assurances from Morris when he meets the Derby owner. He did, however, admit their conversation would be critical when it comes to what the immediate future holds for the club. \u201cThey\u2019re crucial [talks] because we all know the situation,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cContracts are running out for some players, some naturally. The loan players \u2013 we have to think we are going to lose them all, so the squad is low in numbers. So they\u2019re crucial because we know that the club is in a different position to what it has been in years before. Of course, [getting into] the Premier League would change that.\u201d Lampard won pretty much every honour going as a player, but he admitted that taking Derby to the top flight in his first season as a manager would be \u201cright at the top\u201d in terms of those achievements. \u201cI\u2019m not putting it over the Champions League final [in 2012] because for me as a player, personally, the way that felt was incredible. But for a manager, with a different input, and the responsibilities that you have, and working so closely with really good people here, it will be something that goes right up towards that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
