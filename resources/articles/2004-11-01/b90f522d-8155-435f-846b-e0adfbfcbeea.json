This is hardly the most comforting reading once he has been bitten by a snake and his car is stuck in sand. \"All nature around us is dead,\" he reads, in Jane Rogers' gritty Friday Play - Inland Sea (Radio 4). \"If [rain] comes not, our retreat homewards will be cut off and our destruction inevitable.\" Brian and his wife Maura - played with ferocious intensity by Anton Lesser and Niamh Cusack - are taking care of their own destruction. As the adder's venom seeps into his bloodstream, so the poison spreads through their relationship. You just knew this wasn't going to be a shiny, happy trip. \"We've got two mobiles, state-of-the-art vehicles, extra petrol, 20 litres of water, food to last a week. What the hell do you imagine could go wrong?\" Brian asks. Try just about everything. Cusack was especially good as the put-upon wife of a composer with a writing block, a drink problem and a secret girlfriend who is mother to his even-more-secret child. Rogers' writing was fierce and unsentimental, and it all felt horribly, claustrophobically real. \"You're going to have to try to relax,\" Maura tells Brian. \"With ants crawling up my arse and flies feasting on my face and snake venom spreading through my system?\" he replies. These matters, it turns out, are the least of his worries. Enid Blyton, you sensed from Blyton in Bombay (Radio 4), would have had a no-nonsense attitude to such scenarios. This was a gentle, enthralling documentary about the author's enduring popularity among Indian's middle-classes. One grown man recalled the horror he felt on receiving a standard reply, typed and with a signature that had clearly been stamped, to his third letter (\"I almost felt jilted\"). The first two had been hand- written cards and Blyton had even set him up with a British pen pal. \"I wrote a letter to Enid Blyton and she gave me your address,\" the first letter began. Can you imagine JK Rowling finding time for such match-making? Since taking on an allotment, I'm glued to Jeremy Vine (Radio 2) on a Friday, with live reports from a plot in Wales. It sounded especially grim last week, for all the high drama of a parsnip being harvested live on-air (\"just whistle amongst yourselves,\" the digger advised, placing his mobile phone on the soggy soil). Global warming has affected the parsnips (\"he's not looking too happy\") and made everything else very squidgy. \"I'm here on a cold Rhondda hillside,\" Terry said, \"with two wellingtons full of water.\" And they call it the good life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
