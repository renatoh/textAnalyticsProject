In Gloucester, though, there will forever be an asterisk attached to Wasps' success and, impressively though the new champions played for the concluding 80 minutes of this endless season, a desperately one-sided grand final was Premier Rugby's worst nightmare. Persuading Cotswolds Man this was not a serious miscarriage of justice will be tough. The same applies to Gloucester's players and coaching staff. \"It was special and I don't like special things being taken away,\" muttered their director of rugby Nigel Melville, irked as much as anything by official refusal to grant his team any sort of reward for topping the table. \"We've worked our balls off this season, we've finished 15 points clear and we've been really proud of that. We know we're a better side than we saw today. We didn't play and the momentum we've had for the rest of the season wasn't there. Make of that what you like.\" Had Gloucester lost narrowly but played with the verve and spirit that enabled them to finish 15 points clear in the regular Zurich Premiership season, even the Shed at Kingsholm might have grudgingly endorsed the new format. Instead they saw a travesty of a contest, with the team theoretically favoured by a three-week break blown away by a side with more momentum, having the fillip of an easy victory over Bath in the Parker Pen Cup final the previous weekend. When Howard Thomas, chief executive of Premier Rugby, the elite clubs' umbrella body, spoke beforehand about \"lancing the boil\" of criticism of the new format, he certainly never envisaged this much pus and even Clive Woodward, a guest summariser for Sky Sports, voiced his concern. \"Three weeks is just too long,\" insisted the England head coach, noting that Gloucester had last played on May 10. \"You lose all momentum and Wasps have taken advantage of it.\" The championship format will continue regardless for at least the next two years but, if the final is ever to enjoy the same credibility it enjoys in every Australian sport, officialdom must recognise the need to reduce the length of the regular season, thereby lending more weight to the play-offs. The present hybrid is neither fish nor fowl, but no one ever imagined the tailors of Gloucester would make such a pig's ear of their intended silk purse. From the moment Stuart Abbott tore through a midfield hole to put Josh Lewsey over for the first of his two tries with barely a minute gone, there was only one side in it. Wasps' fly-half Alex King won the Peter Deakin medal as man of the match for his effective stewardship as well as a kicking haul of 24 points, but there was a strong case for a joint award to their entire pack, who squeezed the Cherry and White forwards until their pips squeaked. Simon Shaw, Paul Volley and Joe Worsley, in particular, did their England causes no harm, vindicating the decision to take Gloucester on at their strongest point, just as Munster did in Europe. \"We looked at Gloucester and the way they play wide, and we made sure by the time Messrs Garvey and Simpson-Daniel got the ball they were gang-tackled,\" said the Wasps captain Lawrence Dallaglio. Wasps also won because their fitness team under Craig White unleashed a side bursting with energy despite the sweltering heat. For the past three weeks or so they wore the equivalent of bin-liners under their jerseys at training to reproduce the hot, sweaty conditions expected; watching them sprint to the tunnel at half-time while Gloucester's players wearily trudged in summed up the occasion. By then Lewsey had scored his second try, courtesy of good recycling work by Volley, and Gloucester's misery was complete when Simon Amor's pass to Peter Buxton was spilt and Worsley strolled over to complete a well executed sting. No wonder Phil Vickery and James Simpson-Daniel, who sustained an ankle injury which threatens his contribution to England's summer tour, tore their losers' medals from around their necks. \"To be perfectly honest, if you play the way we played today you don't deserve to win,\" said a downcast Vickery. Nor will Dallaglio be posting his winner's medal to his England colleague. \"Gloucester played some outstanding rugby but by and large they played it at the beginning of the season. They have been more consistent than us but, ultimately, on the big occasion they weren't able to deliver.\" He added: \"Perhaps sides may approach the league a little bit differently now. You can't come out of the traps at 100 miles an hour and have nothing left in the tank at the end of the season.\" Next season, at least, will be an easier sell for Premier Rugby. With the top players missing the first three months for the World Cup, only the second half of the season will see teams at full strength and the play-offs will thus become a more legitimate way of deciding the top side. This time, though, Gloucester will always believe a lucky loser picked up their winning ticket.
