The calm, reflective, compassionate gaze he brought to bear on the dilemmas faced by his characters made him the most humanistic of film directors. No less than the work of others, his movies demanded the skills of scriptwriters, cinematographers, editors, composers, costumiers and make-up experts; yet the audience seldom had the sensation of being manipulated by professionals. Instead, they felt they were watching the patient investigation of aspects of their own existences. \"That was the whole secret of Krzysztof,\" I was told after his death by Zbigniew Preisner, a close collaborator who composed the music that became such a salient feature of Kieslowski's best-known works. \"People felt close to him through his films.\" With The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique, made in 1991, and the subsequent trilogy of Three Colours: Blue, White and Red, all of which are included in a 10th anniversary season at the National Film Theatre this month, Kieslowski reached beyond the arthouse audience to find a public thirsty for films marked by a luminous beauty and a sense of spiritual inquiry, films that preferred openness, even uncertainty, to contrivance. Firmly located in the modern world, his films identified a prevailing unease, a feeling - unsatisfied by conventional forms of religion - that our lives contain an untouched dimension. Critics on both sides of the Atlantic were lavish in their praise of a man who seemed to have restored vigour and relevance to European art cinema. Film festivals were falling over each other in their attempts to persuade him to present his latest work. For 20 years he had fought his way through the barriers erected by Poland's failing communist system, and finally he had won. And at that moment, he announced his retirement. By all accounts, Kieslowski was an enemy of the self-aggrandisement endemic to the cinema in general and to directors in particular. An ironist and a pessimist, he was nevertheless upset when the jury at the Cannes film festival in 1994 awarded their Palme d'Or to Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's stylishly violent thriller, rather than to his own Three Colours: Red, the concluding part of the trilogy based on the themes of liberty, equality and fraternity. In its recognition of the potential influence and commercial significance of Tarantino's film, the jury's decision could not be faulted; nevertheless the choice appeared to close the curtain on the European cinema of ideas, a tradition of films based on character-driven narratives and an unhurried approach to pacing. In the history of cinema, it was a pivotal moment. For Kieslowski, it coincided with a looming disenchantment. \"Film has lost its importance,\" he declared later. \"In the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, movies counted. Because everyone was against the communist system, it was easy for us to tell stories the public understood, even during censorship. Now, the audience doesn't know what it wants to see, and we don't know what we want to say.\" He decided to walk away to spend his time more constructively, messing about with his collection of power tools. Less than two years after his announcement, he died in a Warsaw hospital during heart surgery. It was in Warsaw that he had been born in 1941, the son of a civil engineer and an office worker. After a childhood spent moving from town to town as his father, incapacitated by tuberculosis, tried one sanatorium after another in search of effective treatment, he dropped out of a course for apprentice firemen and enrolled, thanks to an uncle's influence, in a school for theatre technicians, before winning a place at the celebrated Lodz film school, the alma mater of Andrzej Wajda, Roman Polanski, Jerzy Skolimowski and Krzysztof Zanussi. Perhaps influenced by his mother's occupation, he chose an obvious target for his first student documentary, a six-minute satire of state bureaucracy titled The Office. His early documentaries and short fictional films dealt with blinded war victims, factory workers, a boy glimpsing someone who might have been the love of his life on a disappearing tram, and the general aimlessness of life in Lodz during the Gomulka era. Isolation was already a theme, notably in a film called X-Ray, set in a TB ward. None of this very early work is included in the NFT season, which begins with The Scar (1976), his first theatrical feature, followed by Camera Buff (1979), a satire from which the state censor cut scenes implying the protagonist's religious faith, and Blind Chance (1982), whose plot device, the exploration of three possible outcomes of the same scenario, anticipates the British rom-com Sliding Doors. By 1984, when he made No End, Kieslowski was already winning prizes on the international festival circuit. This, however, was the first fruit of his collaboration with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, a trial lawyer who, that same year, would successfully prosecute the four state security men accused of murdering Father Jerzy Popieluszko, a young Warsaw priest who had spoken out in favour of Solidarity. Kieslowski and Piesiewicz met in court, while the director was attempting to film cases being tried under martial law; they would go on to create the screenplays for all Kieslowski's remaining films. Although neither man held religious beliefs, a sense of the numinous entered their work from the beginning. In No End a young lawyer dies of a heart attack but is seen watching over his widow as she struggles with her life and with a new relationship. It was Piesiewicz who suggested the idea behind the Dekalog, the series of one-hour television films loosely based on the 10 commandments, from which two particularly striking episodes were expanded to feature length - A Short Film About Killing and A Short Film About Love. Filmed over a period of a year in the same dingy Warsaw apartment block, the episodes are devoid of sentimentality or moralising but full of the most acute observation. Their success brought Kieslowski the patronage of a French production company; almost 20 years after they were made, these films remain clearly the work of a master. Not that Kieslowski imposed his control with a heavy hand. According to Juliette Binoche, the star of Blue, the first of the Three Colours films, the director had little to do with the performances of his principals. \"He is a nice man but he doesn't know very much about acting,\" she told me during an interview conducted three months before the director's death. \"I felt what he wanted, but I had to find my own way. He had just one sentence which for me was freeing. 'I'm only interested in your intimacy. That's what I want to shoot.' He was not interested in the psychology of 'why' or 'why not'.\" Possibly Kieslowski felt that it was the actor's job to know about acting - Binoche, after all, had been brought up in a theatrical family - and that all that was required of him was the \"freeing\". Perhaps the director had subtler, less direct, ways of bringing the best out of his collaborators. Of Piesiewicz, who also came up with the original idea for the trilogy, Kieslowski once said, \"He doesn't know how to write - but he can talk, and not only can he talk, he can think. We spend hours on end talking about our friends, our wives, our children, our skis, our cars. But we keep going back to what would be useful for the story we're inventing.\" According to Preisner, Kieslowski's use of music as an element of the story came from a gradual process of discovery. \"To start with,\" the composer said, \"Krzysztof didn't really know what he wanted from the music. He used it because it was the way that you used music, and somebody had to write it. On the other hand, I knew from the beginning that I wanted to do something different with film music. From that moment, he trusted music more and more. By the time we got to V\u00e9ronique and Blue, the music was almost the centre of the spectrum.\" The critics of his later work would argue that the arthouse audiences of the early 1990s fell so heavily for Kieslowski precisely because he held up the most flattering of mirrors to their self-indulgent preoccupations with identity and fate. As he abandoned the harsher facial features of his unfamiliar Polish actors for the conventional beauty of Binoche, Julie Delpy and Ir\u00e8ne Jacob, the films became increasingly aestheticised. Slawomir Idziak, the director of photography who had given A Short Film About Killing its murky, sulphurous look, drenched The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique in a dream-like amber haze, while Preisner's music edged closer to the \"holy minimalism\" of Gorecki and Part. Yet even though the French-made films usually focused on the existential crises of improbably attractive people, and contained nothing as harrowing as the protracted deaths in A Short Film About Killing, perhaps there was less of a disconnection between the two phases of Kieslowski's career than has sometimes been claimed. What distinguishes the films of both eras is their unembarrassed interest in a spiritual dimension, not just in the continuing presence of the departed but in the probing of the suspicion that our lives have been arranged by fate, by the coincidences that are not coincidences and by the near-misses of which we may not even be aware. But it was in his final phase that Kieslowski began to extend the language of mainstream cinema in order to give himself a visual equivalent of these preoccupations; the black screen that periodically forms an ellipsis evoking the momentary descents into blank grief experienced by the Binoche character in Blue, for example, or the upward spiral of the camera that accompanies the death on a concert platform of Weronika, the Polish choral student, in The Double Life. His retirement meant that the potential for further exploration of such devices would go unrealised. Shortly before entering hospital for what was expected to be a routine heart bypass operation, however, he indicated that he was thinking of renouncing his decision, returning to France and beginning work on another series whose theme had been proposed by Piesiewicz. Again it would be a trilogy. The subjects would be Heaven, Purgatory and Hell. The last, he said, would be set in Los Angeles. \u00b7 Krzysztof Kieslowski Revisited runs until March 28 at the NFT, London SE1.
