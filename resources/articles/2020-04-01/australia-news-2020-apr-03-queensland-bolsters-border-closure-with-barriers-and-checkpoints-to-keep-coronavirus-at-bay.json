The barriers now stretch across the eight suburban back streets, at the formerly invisible line separating neighbours in New South Wales and Queensland. Last week, Queensland had the world\u2019s most porous closed border; restricted for the first time since the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919, but locals described the relatively lax measures as a \u201cdetour\u201d. Suburban border roads were mostly not blocked or closed to avoid causing disruptions to daily life. On Friday, the entwined twin towns of Coolangatta and Tweed Heads were wrenched apart by the red-orange and white barriers and police enforcing the \u201chard closure\u201d at three checkpoints. Police spoke with most cars crossing the border and asked for identification and documents to prove they had a valid exemption. Papers, please. Officers also boarded buses heading north and, in at least one instance, removed a backpacker who had been trying to enter Queensland from Byron Bay. During morning peak hour, traffic was backed up for about 2km. In any other year, this Friday would have been among the busiest days for travellers heading to the Gold Coast. School holidays are scheduled to begin on Saturday, and the mild post-summer break on the coast\u2019s beaches can be as busy as the Christmas period. Two years ago on Saturday, the Commonwealth Games began on the glitter strip. Those famous long stretches of surf and sand have also been the subject of police enforcement in recent days. The police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said on Friday they would begin to fine people for breaking rules about public gatherings, or who lingered on the beach without excuse. \u201cYou can attend the beach to go for an exercise or a swim, but don\u2019t sunbake or congregate,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cActivities like sunbaking ... should not be taking place.\u201d Carroll said that by midday on Friday police had inspected more than 4,000 cars at border checkpoints and turned back 75 people from interstate who did not have an exemption to enter Queensland. The state disaster coordinator, deputy police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, said police were \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the levels of compliance. On the ground, though, locals were processing the reality of dividing what they consider a single community. Brooke Smith lives at Terranora, a New South Wales community near the border on the Tweed River. She told Guardian Australia her husband works in Sydney and would typically return for weekends via the Gold Coast airport at Coolangatta. (The airport\u2019s runway is mostly in New South Wales, but the terminal is in Queensland). \u201cIn non-apocalyptic circumstances he flies into Coolangatta. We haven\u2019t seen him since March 22 and I don\u2019t anticipate we\u2019ll see him until Good Friday and in that case he\u2019ll drive home. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous, everyone seems to be doing the right thing, except for Queensland when they had their elections last weekend,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf they closed the beaches then people would have no reason to swap states to go in. [The Tweed and Coolangatta] is one big community. My favourite restaurants are in Coolangatta. I\u2019m one of the fortunate ones, I still have a job and I could put that back into the local community.\u201d One Tweed Heads resident, Michael, said some locals were parking in streets near the border and walking around the barriers. \u201cThe barriers are at the end of my street,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo cars can barely pass each other at the best of times, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many caravans going to come through there. It\u2019s annoying but I guess we understand why they\u2019re doing it.\u201d For others, the roadblocks were barely a hindrance. A motorist driving a NSW-plated car, heading from Ducat Street, Tweed Heads, towards Kirra was photographed mounting the kerb and crossing the border along the footpath. Police said they were investigating the incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
