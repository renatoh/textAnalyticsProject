Tory-led councils such as Hillingdon, Croydon and Westminster have admitted either placing claimants outside the capital or said they were preparing to do so. Adverts have been placed in local newspapers in Berkshire asking for landlords to become part of a \"three to five years guaranteed local authority scheme\". A political storm erupted over the policy to ship out poor households when it emerged that Labour-run Newham council was planning to move 500 families who relied on housing benefit some 160 miles away, to Stoke-on-Trent. Newham council says it can no longer afford to house tenants on its waiting list in private accommodation. It says rent rises linked to the Olympics and the demand for housing from young professionals has caused rents to rocket in east London. As part of its welfare reforms, the government has introduced caps on housing benefit of \u00a3250 a week for a one-bedroom flat and \u00a3400 for a four-bedroom property. With the government housing benefit cuts starting in January, many councils are wrestling with rising numbers of people finding they cannot afford central London accommodation. A proposal sent to Westminster council by one of its private providers, the Smart Housing Group (SHG), suggested a path of rehousing \"150 people within the next 12 or so months\" to perhaps Derby and Nottingham \"and ideally with an option for [SMG] to increase this number over time to perhaps closer to 500 properties\". Westminster confirmed this was \"one of the options\" it was looking at in conjunction with two boroughs with which it shared services \u2013 Hammersmith and Fulham, and Kensington and Chelsea. It stressed that a decision had yet to be made. A spokesman for Kensington and Chelsea said: \"Unfortunately we are having to consider placing people who approach the council as homeless outside of London. Private rented accommodation in the [borough] is some of the most expensive in the country and so it is inevitable that changes to the local housing allowance will have a greater impact here than in other parts of the capital. \"We have written to all the families affected by the cap on housing benefit to offer them advice and assistance, which has included advising them to look further afield if they wish to access more affordable accommodation. Many will have to make the choice as to whether to move if they cannot find suitable affordable accommodation in London.\" Labour-controlled Ealing council in west London said it had \"not yet had to move any families out of the borough due to the benefit caps. In 2011/12, we placed just a couple of households outside of Ealing though this was by mutual consent. We have recently made offers of out-of-borough private sector accommodation to a small number of families, mainly in Buckinghamshire. The council added: \"It is not possible to accurately predict the number of other families we will need place outside of Ealing, because this will depend on how many landlords are prepared to drop rents to reflect the new LHA rates. However we expect the gap will be too great for many landlords \u2013 particularly with the borough's larger family-sized homes.\" Others admitted they had tried and failed to place families outside the local area. Labour-run Waltham Forest, in north-east London, confirmed it had sent a small number of families to accommodation in Luton just over a year ago, and that the council had also tried to house other people in Kent but the plan fell through. With a waiting list of more than 20,000, the borough was \"crammed to capacity\". A council spokesman said: \"We just haven't got the properties in the borough to meet the need.\" The effects of the housing benefit cap were only just being felt and were expected to make matters worse, he added. Newham said the gap between market rents and the housing allowance was too big following the central government cap on housing benefit payments. Since January, councils have been writing to claimants telling them of shortfalls in rent that they will have to make up. The Chartered Institute of Housing estimates that Newham must have at least 1,500 families affected by welfare cuts immediately. Newham, one of the most economically deprived local authorities in the UK, which legally must house claimants, said it had had to look \"further afield for an alternative supply\" of affordable housing. The Labour-controlled local authority, which will host 2012 Olympics events, wrote to the Brighter Futures housing association in Stoke, offering it the \"opportunity\" to lease homes to the council. Gill Brown, chief executive of Brighter Futures, wrote to local MPs warning of the consequences if \"London boroughs are allowed to export their most vulnerable and challenging families to cities like Stoke-on-Trent\". She likened it to the experiences of 10 years ago, when a Home Office dispersal programme moved thousands of refugees into privately owned properties in north Staffordshire. \"The result was huge unplanned pressure on local services, the collapse of already vulnerable neighbourhoods and the rise of divisive rightwing extremism,\" she said. A Labour MP warned that Newham's move was the \"tip of the iceberg\". Karen Buck, the Labour MP who was passed the Newham letter, said it showed that ministers were wrong when they claimed no one would need to move as landlords would lower rents to accommodate welfare cuts. She said there was increasing evidence that local authorities were not able to meet their responsibilities. \"We see homelessness rising, rents rising and this is a big problem for a government which claimed that none of this would happen.\" Conservative ministers were incensed by the charges. Grant Shapps, the housing minister, said councils would not be allowed to \"export their poor\". He said that rules his department would issue would make \"locality a principal linkage\". He added: \"If somebody is working or has children at school we will not allow councils to send people out of the area.\" Earlier, he accused Newham of overstating the problem and \"playing politics\". Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, called the story nonsense and said there were \"thousands of houses\" within five miles of Newham which fell within the cap. However housing experts said signs indicated that more than 60% of private landlords would not take tenants on benefits. Shelter's chief executive, Campbell Robb, said: \"This is the terrifying reality of our housing crisis today \u2013 hundreds of families potentially forced to move halfway across the country, uprooted from schools, support networks and employment opportunities. \"Most worryingly, this is only the thin end of the wedge, as further reductions in the housing safety net start to bite over the coming months. \"The dangerous cocktail of cuts to housing benefit and spiralling rents is making finding a decent home increasingly unaffordable for families across the country. Those unable or unwilling to move away from their local area may be forced to overcrowd or accept a home in appalling conditions to make ends meet.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
