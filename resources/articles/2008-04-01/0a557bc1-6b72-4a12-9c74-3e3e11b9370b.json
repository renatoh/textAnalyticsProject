Fram is fascinating and often beautiful, but Fridjtof Nansen's journey across the frozen Arctic occupies barely a quarter of the stage time, and it's rather irritating if you're looking for accuracy. There is little sense of the hardship, dirt, desperation and starvation that go with survival on the ice. Nor does the play capture the grandeur of what Nansen and his companion, Hjalmar Johansen, were trying to achieve: conquering the north pole. I suspect the writer, Tony Harrison, feels that exploration is not where real heroism lies- he suggests that there is more heroism elsewhere, in the genuine hardship of poverty, and the struggle to alleviate it. For example, the portrayal of the Volga famine is incredibly powerful. I was disappointed by the way Harrison painted Nansen himself. Perhaps I have put him on a pedestal, but to my mind, he has an unsullied reputation as a tremendous humanitarian and polymath. It's easy to take potshots at explorers' mistakes and faults, but Nansen was the one above all that: he seemed to be universally liked. The suggestion that he and Johansen didn't get on isn't supported by history. Johansen is supposed to have worshipped Nansen. Of course, it can be difficult to stay friendly under extreme circumstances; Ranulph Fiennes and I got on unbelievably well during our polar trips, but inevitably we were frustrated with each other at times. Despite this, I enjoyed Fram. It's an enormously complicated piece of work, delivered in a huge range of styles from slideshow to ballet, and written in rhyming couplets. It's certainly unlike anything I've ever seen before. \u00b7 Fram is at the National Theatre, London SE1, until May 22.
