Having been here for nearly 12 hours straight, you'll not mind if I bugger off with extreme prejudice. Nighty night! -4 Donald (13) -3 Mickelson (F) Scott (11) -2 Simpson (8) Goggin (6*) Presnell (5*) Another tiddler missed, this time by McIlroy on 11, and he drops back to level par. Woods has a tiddler for his par, too, but he'll be putting out tomorrow. He marks his ball at the end of a long day's play. Here's another problem: Westwood's putter, which - and I was right all along about this, I should have more courage of my convictions - is no better than a piece of tin. Having hit his wedge at 13 almost dead, he hoicks the ball past the hole from three feet. A chance of a birdie goes begging. You can't be passing those up. Ernie Els nearly makes a hole in one at 9, clattering his 4-iron off the bank then the bottom of the pin. He'll move to -1. Up on 11, Tiger powers a magnificent flop to a couple of feet, and should scramble par, but again he holds his left hand gingerly after impact. That's a problem. Tiger has a problem with that left hand. He nearly finds the creek down the left of 11 with an iron from the tee. Hitting his second shot from thick rough, he catches the hosel in the grass and hurts his hand. The ball snags up in more thick nonsense down the hole, too. This is turning into a bit of a disaster for the pre-tournament favourite. Meanwhile there's a new name at the top of the leaderboard: Luke Donald, who sends his sand wedge from the 13th tee to four feet, and taps in a little right-to-left curler to move to -4. But while Westwood was faffing around, Donald was quietly picking up another shot. He's taken Westwood's place alongside Mickelson at the top on -3 after back-to-back birdies at 11 and now 12. Westwood's fourth is sent over the flag pot, ten feet past. The bogey putt's missed; he slips off the top of the leaderboard and back to -1. Back on 10, Tiger's woes continue. He clips a sand wedge to six feet, and once again prods with great uncertainty at the ball, the putt drifting to the left. He's not hitting them hard enough, repeatedly. This is like watching Monty in his pomp. Westwood becomes the first victim of the Merion baskets. He's in all sorts of bother down 12. Forced to chip out from filth, he lifts his third shot towards the pin - and watches in impotent horror as the ball clatters off the bulbous lobster pot and ricochets miles back down the fairway! The look of disbelief on Westwood's coupon is a picture, though in fairness it's not the basket weaver's fault he was trying to get up and down from distance to save par. Shots will be dropped here. -3 Mickelson (F) Westwood (11) -2 Donald (11) Goya (9*) Hedblom (9*) Scott (9) Simpson (7) There's a reason G-Mac has such a good record at the US Open. He scraps like buggery. He was +3 after three holes, and now after raking in a long one on 9 and curling another in on 10, he's picked up back-to-back birdies and is +1 for the tournament. Superb stuff. None of them make birdie. Tiger knocks his six feet past the hole. He's been leaving these short. And that's his undoing, because he rattles this one way too hard, the ball staying up top. Another bogey; he's back to +2. Up on 11, Donald knocks his approach to eight feet, a delightful shot, and raps in the birdie putt. He's right in this, and playing very solidly if not spectacularly. Classic Donald, I guess. Tiger, Rory and Scott have all found the 9th green with their tee shots, but none of them are particularly close to the pin. If any of them make birdie, I'll eat this hat: Westwood's eagle putt is a bit meek. He leaves it four feet short. But he knocks in the birdie putt, and through 10 he's -3, the joint leader with Mickelson. That was the least he deserved after a brave tee shot. On 8, Scott and Woods pepper the flag basket with their wedges, but McIlroy's approach is a wee bit long, the result of finding a divot with his tee shot. Unlucky. He nearly drains the 20 footer, but must settle for par. Scott whacks in a confident birdie putt to move to -2. And then Woods fannies his birdie effort, leaving a six-footer two turns short. That is appalling. He remains at +1. That huge effort on 6 hasn't quite got him going as we thought it would. Westwood finds the 10th green with his 3 wood from the tee, and will have himself an eagle putt. If he rakes that one in, it's the tournament lead for Worksop's finest. Meanwhile it's all about Australian golf round these parts these days, and Alistair Presnell has flown out of the blocks with a birdie-birdie start. He's -2, alongside the aforementioned Westwood, Goya, Hedblom and Simpson. Westwood sends his tee shot over the flag at 9, but can't knock in the birdie putt from 20 feet. He's out in 34, tied for second at the moment. He'll have taken that. Meanwhile three birdie attempts on 7. McIlroy is first up, and he clatters a 20-footer straight up the green and into the back of the cup. That's the shot he dropped at the last hole picked straight back up. He's -1. Scott next, but his clack up the green doesn't have enough welly; he's -1 too. And finally it's Tiger, and like Scott there's not enough power to get up to the hole, the ball falling off line at the last. Hats off to Cory McElyea. The young Californian, suffering on his US Open debut, was in all sorts of bother through 7, when he found himself a shocking +9 par. But he only dropped two more shots during the remainder of his round, and though he's propping up the field after signing for an 81, he's shown some rare mettle there. It would have been so easy to totally capitulate after a nightmare start to his Open career. Small acorns, and all that. And there's always tomorrow. Hedblom taps in for his bogey. Mickelson is once again the sole leader of the 113th US Open. Westwood's putter is not to be trusted; the birdie effort at 8 sails by the cup. Scott drives into bother down 6 and is forced to lay up. He snips a wedge to 18 inches and will escape with a par. McIlroy follows a similar route, though his wedge leaves him with a missable six footer. And Tiger? Tiger finds the middle of the fairway, hits a poor approach which leaves him with a 50-foot right-to-left breaker - and knocks it right in the middle of the cup! That's an immense putt, and he punches the air in vindication. Nothing wrong with that paw now. What a superlative birdie! He's back to +1 - and only a shot behind McIlroy now, who can't save his par, prodding very tentatively at a downhill putt. Hedblom punches a gorgeous chip onto 18 from the thick grass at the back. He bumps his ball to a couple of feet, and will get away with a bogey. Limiting damage is just as important as avoiding it in a US Open; that's shown brilliant spirit. (If he misses the putt, I'm coming back to strike a line though this entire entry.) The co-leader Hedblom won't be the co-leader much longer. He found rough off the tee at 18, laid up, and has now sent his third through the back of the green and into the thick stuff. Potentially heading the other way is Westwood, who has lifted his wedge at 8 to ten feet. The defending champ Webb Simpson has just rattled in another birdie effort, this time at 4. He's -2, and that's a very healthy start by the American. Here's a list that may interest / depress / amuse, depending on how nice or nasty a person you are. It's the most majors started without a win, cribbed off the good folk at television concern ESPN: 86: Jay Haas 65: Scott Verplank 64: Robert Allenby 60: Lee Westwood 58: Fred Funk, Sergio Garcia, Steve Stricker The klaxon sounds, and play is under way again. McIlroy knocks in his par putt, and remains at -1. Tiger makes his bogey putt; he's +2. And it's some restart by Westwood, who chips in from rough at the back of 7 to move to -2. The players are making their way back out. We'll be going again soon, the minute they're all back in position. It is on! The second suspension of the day doesn't mean we're finished. The water's falling from the sky in stair rods, but should the storm pass, there's plenty of daylight left to fit a few more holes in. Like the players, I'm downing tools, but I'll be back the moment we know what's happening, and to report on any further play. Ach damn. Just as McIlroy looks to line up a tricky five-foot par saver - he'd nearly drained his birdie effort but the ball skated on past - the hooter goes. Tiger doesn't look happy about it, either, as he's still got a testy, curly dribbler into the cup for bogey. But that might be a timely break for him, because not only is he playing badly, he's feeling that wrist, too. Here's how we stand at the very top as the players trudge off ... -3 Mickelson (F) Hedblom (7*) -2 Goya (7*) Pettersson (4*) Scott can't get up and down from the front of 5, and drops a shot. A proper lesson to learn about Merion, there: miss the fairways, like Scott and Woods did, and you're up against it if you want one of those there pars. Tiger's left with a massive u-shaped putt, and he underhits it. That'll be another bogey, his third of the round with only five holes played! He's clenching and unclenching his right hand now, so I'm not sure what he's done back there. But then I'm not a doctor, and even if I was there's an ocean between me and the patient. So what can anyone realistically expect there? There's rain about. The weather warning signs are up, as are the umbrellas, though nothing too dramatic appears to be happening just yet. The same can't be said for events on 5, where Tiger fluffs his chip a little bit, not giving it enough, a repeat performance of his poor effort on 3. This could easily cost him another shot; he's 15 feet short of the hole. And we have a new joint leader of the tournament: Peter Hedblom, who birdied 16 and has now just stroked in a 20-footer from the back of 17 to move to -3. Tiger finds rough down the right on 5. He powers a wood out to the back of the green, but at what cost? He holds his left arm up in the air, a tweak of pain perhaps in his wrist. Hopefully that's nothing more than a twinge. Scott is close to dumping his drive in the drink down the left, but is able to play out of the side of the hazard. He bumps his second just in front of the green. McIlroy, rather boringly by comparison, hits his drive down the middle and finds the front of the green with his approach, 15 feet from the flag. Elsewhere, Els is a turn of a ball away from raking in a 20-foot birdie putt on 3. He'll settle for par. As will Westwood on 6, who sliced his approach into the stand, but managed to get up and down from the dropzone. He's still -1. -3 Mickelson (F) -2 Goya (6*) Hedblom (6*) Scott (4) Pettersson (3*) The reigning champion, Webb Simpson, has just clacked a 5-wood to a couple of inches from the tee at 3. That's the shot of the day. He'll go to -1, a nice solid start suddenly turned into something a little bit better. After booming his drive down 4, Tiger lays up in front of the stream and sends a wedge over the flag. But he doesn't hit the putt coming back down the green, and will have to settle for a frustrating par. He's not quite firing. McIlroy might have turned a corner, though. He follows Tiger down the hole, but after sending his wedge over the flag, manages to give his putt enough juice to drop. Scott, meanwhile, moves further on up. His brave, booming second shot over the drink finds sand to the left of the green, but he's able to get up and down for his second birdie of the day. After four holes, Tiger's already three shots behind the hot Masters champion, a player whose major championship record is beginning to look extremely formidable: his worst showing last year was a tie for 15th at Olympic, and this year he's won the green jacket. What a player. And what a response to heartbreak at Lytham. The Open champion Ernie Els sends his third at 2 pin high, 12 feet from the flag basket. He rattles it in; he's -1. Els has put in strong performances at the US Open lately: a third-place finish in 2010, a top-ten finish last year. Lytham proves he still knows how to lock down a major. He couldn't, could he? He's wily enough, don't rule it out. Carl Pettersson, who came so close at the PGA last year, has started well. He's birdied 12, and now he's sent his wedge at the ludicrously short par-three 13th to a couple of feet. He'll surely be -2 alongside Goya in a wee minute. Lee Westwood's putter a useless bit of tin, was that? Er, no. He guides a lovely approach into the green at 5, pin high, leaving himself a 20-footer with a gentle left-to-right break. It's always going in, a fantastic effort. Donald can't make his par putt, though. Suddenly both Englishmen are at -1. Rory makes his par, his third in a row. It somehow feels he's been playing worse than that. Donald hits his first bubble of turbulance, finding the rough down the right of 5. He's forced to lay up and hope to get up and down from 80 yards or so. His approach is pretty decent, but he's still facing an eight-footer for par. On 15, Estanislao Goya, already -1, bounces his approach round the bank by the left of the green and sends his ball to a couple of feet. He'll be -2 in a minute, barring a rush of blood to the noggin. Cabrera, a shot to the good today, is in all sorts of trouble down 5. He's on top of a bank to the right of the green, playing his fourth shot. He flops high into the air and lands his ball on the edge of the green, allowing it to roll 40 feet down the slope and stop four feet from the cup. That should save his par. Assume it's so, unless you hear me scream. Meanwhile back on 4, Tiger can't make his par putt, and drops back to +1. Scott, deservedly so, makes his birdie putt to move to -1, tickling a right-to-left effort down the green. And Rory... let me get back to you about Rory. Tiger's chip down the green doesn't catch the slope, and stops a good 15 feet from the hole. McIlroy's in the deep bunker, ostensibly in a lot more trouble, but he splashes out majestically, the ball biting in front of the hole and stopping four feet away. He should make his par, but then he should have made his birdie on 1. On 3, Woods sends his tee shot into rough on the left. McIlroy dumps his into a bunker on the right. And Scott fires an iron straight at the pin, leaving him with an eight-footer for birdie. That's a great golf shot. Up on 4, Westwood has a birdie putt from 12 feet, but doesn't hit it, a dreadfully weak effort dying miles before the hole and turning off to the left. He should probably start aiming for the wicker baskets, that putter's never going to win him a major championship. One of the pre-tournament favourites, the 2010 champion Graeme McDowell, has suffered an appalling start. He double-bogeyed 2, and has followed that up by dropping another shot at 3; he's +3 already. G-Mac has a superlative record in US Opens, but this looks like queering his CV already. Tiger had found sand, and splashes out to 12 feet. Despite it all, he'll have that for his birdie. Scott sends his first putt ten feet past the hole. McIlroy meanwhile can only find the rough by the edge of the green with his third, and duffs his next chip. He'll have a 12-footer for par. He makes it, though, a staunch clatter right into the back of the cup. That's as good an escape as his miss on the 1st was miserable. Tiger then strokes home his birdie putt. He's looking a lot calmer all of a sudden, and even gives the crowd an overly excited wave. Finally Scott makes his par putt. They move on, best forgotten on the whole. Meanwhile on 1, the 2012 US Amateur champion, Steven Fox, birdies after clipping his approach to six feet. Spirit of Bobby Jones, and all that. Does Tiger ever start major tournaments well? He's pushed his second into bother down the right of 2. Is that in the deep rough or the bunker? I'm not sure yet, but either way he's given himself a test. As has McIlroy, who has almost snap hooked one miles left behind a stand. That is unspeakably dreadful. Scott, who had pulled his drive into the rough and chipped out, sends his third onto the green, but only just, leaving himself a long two putts for par. \"For goodness sake Scotty,\" he tells himself, perhaps the most polite curse in the history of All Australia. Woods shows no such sign of holding back, and swings his driver around in frustration. It's wonderful watching Tiger lose his temper. He briefly considers hacking up every blade of grass in Pennsylvania, but thinks better of it. The three best players in the world, and they're hacking it around here. There's something strangely satisfying about this. Luke Donald really should be -3 after three holes, but -2 will do. He's just rolled in a beauty on the 3rd, across the green from 30 feet. One of those putts that looked in all the way from the moment it left the face of the putter. Donald allows a small smile to play across his face. That's a great response after the disappointment of that tiddler missed on 2. What a start by the Englishman, who might have decided that it's about that time. Early birdies for Angel Cabrera, Brian Stuard, Brendan Steele, Peter Hedblom, Rory McIlroy and Zach Johnson, and suddenly the leaderboard's got a different flavour. Here's what it looks like... -3 Mickelson (F) -1 Colsaerts (F) Cabrera (3) Stuard (3*) Donald (2) Steele (2*) Hedblom (2*) Z Johnson (1) Tiger really is cold. He misreads his putt from the back of the green and leaves himself eight feet short of the flag, with a difficult breaker to save par. Scott so nearly rakes in a monster for birdie. Then it's Tiger again, and he doesn't really hit his par effort, the ball breaking to the right in front of the cup. He drops a shot, a shocking effort. Which is also how we can describe McIlroy's birdie putt, a desperate slide past the hole. A chance to put an immediate two shots between himself and the tournament favourite, but he'll have to settle for par. There goes Donald's strong start! He clacks a terrible putt to the left of the hole, and has to settle for par. What an opportunity spurned. That's incredibly poor. Speaking of dismal efforts, back on 1 there's a poor approach by Tiger, clumped to the back of the green. Scott's is even worse, a similar outcome, though his shot was from the fairway. McIlroy shows them how it's done, finding the centre of the green, then catching spin which brings his ball all the way back to within six feet of the hole. A great birdie chance to begin. Donald has started very strongly. He's clipped his third at 2 to six feet, and really should convert for birdie to move to -2. His playing partner Lee Westwood opens with a couple of pars. He'll be happy enough with that. And Rickie Fowler signs for a 70 after a birdie at 10. Tiger's on the tee! And he's driving like a madman again, pushing one into thick rubbish down the right. That's abysmal. Rory McIlroy up next, and he clatters his opening drive straight down the middle. Much better. Finally, it's the new Master golfer, Adam Scott, who flirts with the second cut down the right but stays on the fairway. Woods is hot favourite this week, understandably so given his showing at the Masters and the win at the Players, but if he starts driving like Seve he'll have no chance around here. Two putts for Ian Poulter on 10, and he's signing for a one-over 71. That's a slight shame given his blistering start, a round undone early doors by the weather. But he hung on in there, and is right in the tournament. As are Charl Schwartzel and Tim Clark, the South African pair signing for level-par 70s. Luke Donald needs to stop fannying about and win a major championship. So here's a good sign: he sends his approach at the 1st to 12 feet, then tickles in a left-to-right curler for birdie. He's now tied for second place after ten minutes' work. Meanwhile Boo Weekley, +7 going up the last, chips in from 80 yards. He's signing for a 75 now. Phil Mickelson has been explaining why he's left his driver at home. \"Length is not critical here. Fairways are critical.\" Nothing you didn't already know, and yet he's one of the few who's been playing it canny, and look what's happened. Poor Jerry Kelly has made a nine-course tasting menu of the last hole. In deep rough down the right, he squirts one through the green into thick stuff down the back, duffs his chip only halfway to the hole, and can't make the 15-foot bogey putt. That's a double-bogey six to finish, and he's back to level par. A 70's probably better than the 46-year-old had imagined at the start of the day, but significantly worse than he'll have hoped ten minutes or so ago. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the game they call Golf Game for you. Sergio has clipped a beautiful wedge to 18 inches on 10. He'll have that to tap in for birdie, and a 73. Given he was out to +7 at one point, with a quadruple bogey on his card, that is a quite stunning recovery by a player under an immense amount of pressure (admittedly all of his own making, the toolkit). But that shows character not always evident, and despite it all he's still in this tournament, although admittedly on the verges of it. Is Ian Poulter on his way back? He sent a gorgeous approach into 8 to four feet, and rattled the birdie putt in; he's back to +1. On 18, Coetzee sees a decent par effort slide by the hole, and he's signing for a 71 that could have been so much better. And Kelly, going so well, pushes his approach to the long par-four 18th into deep nonsense down the right. Hopefully he can fashion some sort of Mickelsonesque escape; his good-humoured round doesn't deserve a tragic finish. Remember poor Ramblin' Roger Tambellini? He's signed for an 80. He was going well on the back nine, level par between 11 and 17, but another double bogey at the final hole, his fifth of the round, set the seal on a miserable day. He's still propping up the field at +10, though chances are he won't be in last spot come the end of the day. His fellow Californian, young debutant Cory McElyea, is living his worst nightmare: three double bogeys and three bogeys between holes 2 and 7 saw him topple to +9. He's since steadied the ship with five pars over the next six holes, but the other was another bogey, and at +10 with the closing five holes to come, hope is not his friend at the moment. Kelly makes another crazy par putt, holing out from 20 feet at 17 after leaving his first putt from the front of the big green well short. He remains at -2, one off Mickelson's mark. Meanwhile Justin Rose - his constitution bolstered by many a youthful feed from Basingstoke gastronomic emporium Chick Mex - has fought back brilliantly today. He was +4 after dropping a shot at 5, his 13th hole of the day, but carded back-to-back birdies at 6 and 7, and has now finished the day with a birdie at 10. There was a bit of luck involved; his approach from the rough took a flier but clattered into the pin, stopping it bounding miles past the cup. He knocked in the resulting five-footer, and he's +1 for this tournament having signed for a very passable 71. He'll feel very good about himself this evening. -3 Mickelson (F) -2 Kelly (16) -1 Colsaerts (F) Weir (12*) Phelan -a- (11*) Pan -a- (11*) That's Phil's best opening round at a US Open since 1999. It's his birthday on Sunday, which is of course also Fathers' Day. It couldn't happen for him at last, could it? A Phil Trifecta? The way he was scrambling today, then took advantage of his work by adding a couple of birdies to the mix, anything is possible. There won't be a dry eye in the house if he manages it. Mickelson raps his birdie effort up the green at 10, but it's never going in. He taps in for his 67, and leads this tournament at -3. Fowler, who missed from a couple of feet on 5 - for a double, rather than a common or garden bogey, as I suggested earlier, so sue me - now goes the other way, raking in from nearly 40 feet on 6 for a birdie; he's back to +1. Meanwhile Coetzee misses another short putt, this time on 17, to drop back to level par. A birdie effort for Schwartzel on 8 drifts millimetres wide left of the hole from 15 feet. The pain on his grid - this has happened a fair few times to the former Master today - is heartbreaking. He really thought that was going in, and appears to have had enough. Also with the face on: Phil Mickelson, who places a careful iron up the 10th from the tee, then duffs his wedge into the green, leaving birdie unlikely. Jerry Kelly's happy enough, though, as he's just saved his par on 16 with a remarkable long putt. Kelly has the good grace to acknowledge his silly escape with a big, goofy grin. It's so nice to see people enjoy their golf. I did hear talk that it was possible, but never believed it could be so. It's all going badly wrong for Poulter, who three putts 6 to double bogey and drop back to +2. What a promising start, and what a sorry capitulation. But it's possible to bounce back from this. Tim Clark, who ruined all his early good work with a double at 5 and another dropped shot at 6, has teased in a huge right-to-left breaker on 8 for birdie, and suddenly he's back at level par for the tournament. Nicolas Colsaerts has signed for a one-under 69. He's the first man in the clubhouse under par. Two shots behind, with decent enough 71s, are the big-hitting pair of Bubba Watson and Dustin Johnson. Neither were totally on top of their game today, so they'll be happy enough with that, providing Mickelson doesn't birdie 10, and the course keeps Tiger on the leash later today. Lefty does it again! He claps a tee shot into the heart of 9, then strokes a big left-to-right breaker down the green and in from 25 feet. He's the sole leader again, now at -3, and with a good birdie chance at 10, his final hole. How precious do all those preposterous par saves look now? Poulter will be cursing that rain delay this morning. Three birdies in three holes before the heavens opened, he's never really got going since. Another dropped shot at 5 sends him clattering back down to level par. It's hardly a disaster, but he'll be ruing that lost momentum. Also on 5, Fowler misses a ludicrous tiddler to drop back to +1. What a putt by Jerry Kelly! The old boy's got a putt for a share of the lead at 15, a 25-footer from the back of the green. It's an unlikely effort, but it drops. He's required to set it off just to the left of the hole, whereupon it breaks back a few feet to the right, before turning softly at the last to drop into the cup. That required such a delicate touch! He's up to -2 with Mickelson. And some good news for young Pan, who enjoyed a share of the lead a while back. He dropped shots at 16 and 17 to slip back to level par, but he's in the black again after sinking one on the 1st. On 8, the leader Mickelson sends his approach straight over the flag, but the ball doesn't catch any spin as it lands, and stops pretty much dead, 15 feet from the pin. A certain par, but the disappointed look on the Lefty Coupon suggests he was desperate to make a second birdie in a row and turn a decent round into a very good one. Meanwhile Nicolas Colsaerts struggled after the turn, dropping shots at 1, 3 and 5, but he's just registered back-to-back birdies at 7 and 8, and he's back to -1. A chance for Coetzee to join Mickelson at -2, but he prods pathetically at a six-foot dribbler, and the ball skitters off to the left. He'll remain at -1. Which is where the amateur Irish youngster Phelan is: he'd dropped a stroke at 18, but picks it straight back up at the 1st with a lovely confident 15-foot putt. \"How about a little love for the Canadian?\" begins Steve Buist, admirably cocking a snook to populist sloganeering. \"What a story success for Mike Weir would be. Dogged by persistent injuries over the past few years, his world golf has plunged from a high of No3, I think, in 2003, to No967 at the moment.\" Mickelson, having fannied around chancing his arm for several holes, gets his business face on. He clips a measured tee shot down the middle of 7, then sends his wedge to a couple of feet. Tappity tap, and he's in for birdie. He's now the sole leader of this tournament at -2. Going the other way is Schwartzel, who drops another shot at 5; he's back to level par. \"I think you've got give credit to the USGA,\" opines Cameron Yule, admirably cocking a snook to populist sloganeering. \"Everyone was talking about the course being too short and ending up as a birdie fest, yet the scoring today is even lower than it was on the first day at Olympic last year. Congrats, Mike Davis!\" -1 Mickelson (14) Schwartzel (12*) Coetzee (14) Kelly (13) Poulter (12*) Stefani (10) Weir (9*) At 4, Poulter stabs a birdie effort down the glassy green towards the hole from eight feet. It dies to the left right at the death. Poulter throws his club into the air in frustration, then forgets to catch it as it falls, and is forced to sheepishly repair the mark it makes in the green. He'd have had sole leadership of the tournament had that gone in, for Clark misses his putt to double-bogey 5, and drop back to level par. Suddenly, it's a seven-way tie for the lead, the top of the board looking something like this ... Clark can only hack out from the rough down the right of 5, then clips his approach to 15 feet. He's got half a chance to get out of there with a bogey, but he'll be dropping at least a shot there. If he sinks his putt, he'll still have a share of the lead, though, because Coetzee has stabbed an eight-footer to the right of the hole at 14 to drop back to -1. As things stand, Clark's the sole leader at -2, but change is a-comin'. Mickelson makes another ludicrous escape, this time on 6. He hoicks a useless approach into a bunker back left of the green, splashes out to ten feet, a very decent result from where he was, and then rattles in the par saver. He's still -1, having got away with murder over the last few holes. He surely can't keep carrying on like this. But then how many times have I said that. Fowler gets up and down from a tricky position in a greenside bunker at 3, to save his par and remain at level. On 18, Weir tries to save his par from the front of the green, but can't rake in a 25-footer and drops back to -1. And some trouble for Clark, one of only two leaders now, down 5; he finds Mickelson's Creek, though he too can hack out of the hazard. But he only succeeds in sending the ball into filth down the other side of the fairway. He'll do very well to avoid dropping a shot there, and might even shed a couple if he's not very careful. Schwartzel bogeys the long par-five 4th to drop back to -1; the lead's shared between Clark, Coetzee and Weir. Phelan rakes a delicious long putt up 17 to a couple of feet, saving his par from a very tricky position. He's still one of only ten players under par so far today. They thought the scoring was going to be a lot lower than this, but with the course punishing any minor deviation of line, the low numbers simply haven't been there. Good. This is the US Open. To mangle Jonathan Wilson, goals birdies are over-rated. A brilliant par 3 for Poulter at the 3rd. He stuffs his hybrid into the bunker to the right of the green. It's as deep as a house, but Poulter splashes out to five feet, a wonderful blind shot, and rolls in to stay at -1. Incidentally, these greens have, so we're told, been reading 13 on the stimp. That is ludicrous, especially given the soaking they took earlier. What on earth are they going to be like under a baking sun? I have a feeling Merion is going to deliver a classic. Perhaps brushed with the occasional moment of high farce, but a classic nonetheless. Yep, if there's one player with the ability to extricate themselves from bother, it's Phil Mickelson. He chips out of the creek, and then gets up and down from 100 yards to save his par at 5. There's no reason he can't achieve his life's ambition this week, other than it's probably asking too much to wriggle out of the grip of disaster every other hole, even for him. A dropped shot for the amateur Pan sees him slip out of the leading bunch. Meanwhile Rickie Fowler, who was +2 going \"out\" between holes 11 and 18, has registered back-to-back birdies, the second at 2 the result of a raking putt from 30 feet, and he's nicely placed at level par. Another name at the top of the leaderboard, and it's George Coetzee, following his opening hole birdie with another at 11. The South Africans are really giving it some on this opening day; that's three of them tied for the lead, and another in Jaco Van Zyl a shot behind. Poor old Louis Oosthuizen (+3) will be wondering which God he's annoyed, and how. Back on 5, Mickelson flirts with the creek down the left, and the situation develops into a full-blown affair, his ball toppling into the blue vagueness. A capitulation's never far away from Lefty at the US Open, and this year he's starting early. Perhaps it's best to get it out of the way, if he can just hang on in there. Haw, this is brilliant. Sergio, having birdied 1, sends his approach at 2 into the heart of the green, then rolls in an eagle putt from 15 feet. As the ball drops, it's met with a huge roar from the gallery at Merion, who may have decided that Sergio's paid his karmic price for his sins over those opening eight holes and, having shown genuine contrition, deserves another chance now. That's quite a touching moment, because Garcia - whose crime was surely borne of stupidity rather than anything else more sinister - looked genuinely broken for a wee while there. He's still +4, mind. -2: Schwartzel (10*), Clark (10*), Weir (6*), Pan (5*) -1: Mickelson (11*), Coetzee (10), Poulter (9*), Van Zyl (6*), Phelan (5*) E: Mahan (13), Colsearts (12*), Kelly (9), Hoffman (9), Day (9*), Stefani (6), Labelle II (5) Not so many players under par, or even level with it, huh? US Open going on here! Note the Irish amateur Kevin Phelan is one of them, while the 2003 Master golfer Mike Weir, who's only here as an alternate, has joined the leaders with birdies at 13 and now 16. A ten-footer for Poulter on 1. It would give him a share of the lead, but it doesn't drop. Clark stays with a share of it at 2, stroking in a 20-footer to save his par. And the 21-year-old amateur from Chinese Taipei, Cheng-Tsung Pan, birdies 11 and 14 to join Clark and Schwartzel at the top! The young man's leading the US Open! Magnificent. Speaking of magnificence, Mickelson saves his par at 3 by knocking in his five-footer. What an escape that was, because his tee shot was beyond nonsensical. Riffing on Sergio's pain (No764 in a never-ending series): \"Do you think Tiger might be tempted to leave a note in Sergio's locker on Friday night with a list of local tapas bars that he can watch the golf from over the weekend?\" quips Simon McMahon. Meanwhile Niall Mullen adds: \"Sergio doesn't have to be in the USA to get delicious fried chicken. If he'd lived near me in West London he could have sampled the ware at Chick-O-Ribs, a restaurant near Kew Bridge which proudly purveys both food groups.\" You people do love kicking a man when he's down. Or is he?!?!! He bogeyed 18, but he's just birdied 1 to move back to +6. He's on the march! (He's not on the march.) On the subject of fried chicken, perhaps Justin Rose could have educated Sergio in the ways of the delicious bird, for back in his teenage years Rose could occasionally be spotted in Chick Mex, the Basingstoke chicken and kebab emporium at the top of Church Street, which in an ideal world would have been run by Lee Trevino, but was not. Mickelson manages to leave himself short of the hole. Nobody else could do that. What an amazing flop, played with a 64-degree wedge. It drops right on the fringe of the green, having made it over the sand by one full rotation, then rolls to five feet. Just amazing. The winner this week might just be the player who makes the most escapes from the penal nonsense which guards this course. If that's the case, there's nobody more likely. Lefty has set himself quite a poser on 3, pulling his tee shot to the right of the bunker on the right. He'll have to flip one up from thick grass over sand, with the pin tight on that side of the green, and little dancefloor to play with. If anyone can do it, Mickelson can, but my goodness that's a terrible tee shot. Up on 18, Poulter's approach finds a bunker, from which he can't get up and down; he drops back to -1. Schwartzel and Clark are the joint leaders, and there ain't nobody tearing this course up, baby. Merion, short and now damp, was at the mercy of these players, it was said. Well, of the 78 players out on the course at present, only 11 are under par, and only three of those by more than one shot. There's a score out there for someone who goes on a hot streak, but this course has already showed that, unless you go round placing your ball with David Grahamesque accuracy, avoiding bogeys is nothing more than a pipe dream. There's a reward on offer, but by God they'll have to work for it. From a greenside bunker at 2, Mickelson whips a stunning shot up into the air and back down, across acres of sand and a fair bit of grass too. The ball bites six feet from the hole. That's a great opportunity for birdie, but Lefty hits an overly aggressive effort towards the hole, allowing the ball no chance to break back left to right and into the cup. It races four feet past, and he does well to hold his nerve and hole out for par. He remains -1, but walks off a very difficult hole thinking of the share of the lead he could have enjoyed. Up on 3, Johnson clatters a 5 wood pin high - a 5 wood into a par three for Dustin Johnson! - but his birdie effort never looks like dropping. The marvellously entertaining Dustin Johnson rakes in a 30-footer on 2. It's for bogey, but one of those he won't feel too bad about, having spattered his ball out of bounds en route, the eager, hapless puppy. He's level par. Bubba rattles one in too, but his is for birdie, and after an undistinguished start he's only +1. Up on 17, Pouter's tee shot finds the edge of the green, but he's a long way from the pin, and facing two putts across a green like a warped record. He takes three, and drops back to -2, sharing his lead with Schwartzel and Tim Clark, who after early birdies at 12 and 13 has been as steady as you like over the rest of the back nine. Birdies for Jason Day, who came so close at the Masters back in April, at 13 and 15. All the talk's been of Adam Scott, of course, but could Day be the guy to take the Merion mantle from David Graham and keep it down under? Ah, hold on, just as I was typing that laboured nonsense, he's just shed a shot at 16, missing a tiddler, to drop back to -1. Still, a decent enough start by the young Aussie, who surely has a major championship in him. Garcia's tee shot at 17 only just found the front of the green, so he does rather well to get in for his par. Only the hapless Roger Tambellini is doing worse than Sergio (+6); he's just responded to three pars in a row with another double, his fourth of the day, at 10 to drop down to +8. Ouch. Here's Steve Buist with some succour for the stricken Spaniard: \"On the bright side, America being America, a short drive in any direction and Sergio will be able to pick up a bucket of fried chicken to console himself.\" Louis Oosthuizen has just raked in the monster of the day so far, a 40-foot right-to-left swinger on 18. Marvellous, but he doesn't celebrate too wildly, because he was +5 before that birdie effort dropped. More grim news for the South Africans, as Schwartzel can't save his par on 18, sending his third pin high to 12 feet but stabbing a poor par putt past the hole. He's back to -2. Poulter, who satisfied himself with par on 16, his first par of the day, is now the sole leader at -3. Schwartzel is in a bit of bother down 18. He's only a couple of feet off the right-hand side of the fairway, but it's thick, lush rough that he's in and he opts to take his medicine and pitch out. He'll have to get up and down from 100 yards to retain a share of the lead with Poulter, who has given himself half a chance on 16 for birdie, sending his approach pin high but 20 feet from the hole. Meanwhile the first really big cheer of the day, as Phil Mickelson sends a lame wedge into the delightful 1st hole, then rolls in a 30-footer for birdie: he's -1. Could this finally be his year? He's in form, and there'd be no more popular winner. It'd be great to see Lefty finally win his national title. The only worry is, like Monty before him, he perhaps wants it a little bit too much. But how good would it be to see him smiling as he walks down 18 on Sunday? Charley Hoffman's solid start is beginning to turn decidedly rickety. Chipping his third shot into the par-four 5th, he doesn't get enough meat on the ball, and the spin takes it wheeching back down to the front edge of the green. He'll drop a shot and move back to -1. Meanwhile there's a majestic meltdown on 6 by Rory Sabbatini, who sends his ball bounding straight through the green and takes his glove off, ripping it into tiny pieces as he does so. He's +3 through 6. Roger Tambellini now has some assistance with his task of propping up the field. He's been joined by Sergio Garcia, who took eight strokes on 15 after winging his drive OB, a quadruple bogey. Dear Jesus. He's now +6 through his first six holes, having stemmed the bleeding on 16 with a par. But that's him out of this Open, having never for a moment looked in it. Hoffman has bogeyed 4 to drop back to -2, which means for a few seconds we had a sole leader in Charl Schwartzel. Only for a few seconds, though, for Poulter makes his birdie putt on 15. It was only seven or eight feet, but far from easy; he set the ball wide to the right before it curled back in deliciously and dropped with unerring accuracy. He looks very pleased with himself, which admittedly isn't a great shift in the natural order, but let the man indulge himself, that was a brilliant response to his setback at 14. It's been a strange start for Justin Rose with the putter. He missed a tiddler on 15 to drop a shot, but he's got up and down from the bottom ledge of the 17th green to save par from distance. He remains at +1. On 15, Poulter gives himself a great chance of bouncing back from that bogey with a birdie, sending an 8 iron approach to eight feet. Not a gimme, but he'll be disappointed if he misses it nonetheless. John Peterson, who finished tied for fourth last year at Olympic and made a hole in one there, nearly does it again this year at 13. His shot is almost an exact replica of Fujita's, a few moments earlier, except it rolls back past the left of the hole instead of the right. A fair chance someone might get it exactly right here, the hole only 102 yards long, and these players absurdly accurate with their wedges. On 13, the star of the picture at the top of this report, Hiroyuki Fujita, clips his wedge over the flag, the ball biting and nearly spinning back into the cup. He's a dimple or two away from a hole in one. Magnificent shot by the Japanese qualifier. As it is, he'll settle for a birdie 2; he's level par for the championship. Poulter gives himself half a chance by sending his third shot at 14 to 15 feet, but can't knock in the par putt and drops back to -2. And some wholly predictable Sergio news: he double bogeys 14 after losing his ball with his drive, drops back to +2, and then wangs his drive at 15 out of bounds as well. The pressure of performing in the wake of his recent shame is getting to him, it would appear. Poulter takes his medicine and hacks his ball onto the fairway, not making the mistake of trying to grab back too much.He's not looking particularly happy, though; a shame the weather made off with his momentum. Meanwhile shot of the day so far by Colsearts on 18, who from the drop zone sends his ball bounding, then rolling right across the green to two feet. That's a great par save, one that'll feel as good as a birdie. Schwartzel has chipped in from the back of 15 to join Poulter and Hoffman at the top of the leaderboard. It was a brilliant chip, though it was just as well he was dead on line, for that ball was flying a long way past the pin if it didn't drop. How long Poulter will stay up there is a moot point; he's sent his drive at 14 into deep grass, and having nearly lost his ball, is now in deep discussion with an official over whether the thing is embedded in the wet mud. He wins the row, but still has to drop into the thick, wet nonsense. God speed, Mr Poulter, though he's done quite well even to find his ball, so everything's a bonus. Not a good restart by Colsearts, who sends a flyer straight through 18 and onto a dirt track behind the green. He was standing right by the Hogan plaque there, in the shadow of genius. Keegan Bradley has triple-bogeyed 16, off the back of a bogey at 15, and is +4 through his first six holes. And Charley Hoffman has joined Poulter at the top of the tree by guiding in a tricky downhill tiddler on 3 for his third birdie on the bounce; he's -3. Right, folks, we're about to get under way again. Ian Poulter, the tournament leader - well, he is - stands on the 14th tee, fiddling around with his bag, waiting for the klaxon to sound and play to resume. Here's how the 113th US Open, very much in its infancy, stands at the moment ... -3: Poulter (3*) -2: Colsearts (7*), Schwartzel (4*), Clark (4*), Hoffman (2) -1: D Johnson (7*), Mahan (5), Stricker (5*), Coetzee (3), Manassero (2*), Palmer (1) Bringing you down immediately from a high, it's the way of sport. There's more bad weather expected at around 4pm local time, 9pm in the British money. So we'll get major championship golf today, just not a whole load of the stuff, so sweet, special and rare. Still, something's better than nothing, and it was looking distinctly unpromising for a while back then. Word is we're good to go for a 5.10pm start! Golf golf golf! In the meantime, let's stare at some dudes. Here's Ben Hogan on his way to a heroic victory at the 1950 US Open ... ... and this is Lee Trevino gadding around in 1971, having just drained a birdie putt in the play-off with Jack Nicklaus. Just look at the pained expression on the Golden Bear's grid! The range has been reopened, which suggests the USGA seaweed is shrivelling up and the worst of the storm has passed. The course is in pretty good nick, by all accounts, despite the lashing it's just taken. They just need to tart up a few bunkers, and we'll be good to go. Given the players need to warm up again, hit a few balls, and be piloted from the big safe house at Merion's other course, it could still be an hour before we're under way. But hopefully we'll be going sooner, because there's a major championship to be played here, and it's an awful shame to be waiting about. USGA statement in ten minutes, my dimpled balatas. All they're saying is, they've sent some Evaluation Executives to pop out and take a look at the state of the course, with a view to telling us some actual news in 15 minutes or so. Expect a communiqu\u00e9 at around 6pm, then. Outside of the official channels, the word is that the storm has pretty much passed, and that there will be several hours of play before Merion suffers another meteorological malady later in the day. With the weather at Merion easing up - it's still raining, but lighter, and it's getting brighter, with patrons trickling back onto the course in the hope of seeing some action - the USGA are going to issue some sort of statement in ten minutes or so. Hopefully we'll get going again soon enough. \"At Bethpage in 2009, the heavens opened and there were rain delays aplenty,\" recalls John McClure. \"This afforded a great opportunity for the New York crowd to get into the beer tents and, on one of the days, actually empty them. The atmosphere that evening when play resumed for a couple of hours was tremendous. It was like being at a football match. Granted, it's perhaps a little early in the day for that kind of behaviour, but does the Phillie crowd have it in them to match that standard?\" You'd have to hope so. If they come out of the tents seven wicker baskets to the wind, it'd complete a British trifecta: the design of the course, the weather, and thousands of normally reserved folk disgracing themselves while paggered on booze. In lieu of action, here's the green staff at Merion wheelspinning around on their two new Tranz-Former Rollers, which they recently took delivery of. Darren is already all over it. Now then, I suppose you'll be wondering how Sergio, the professional golfer and full-time daft bugger, was greeted as he took to the course in the wake of his recent buffoonish attempt at leftfield humour. According to this gentleman from the Golf Channel, he was met with studied indifference. So that's that, then. He did get a big cheer when sending his tee shot at 13 to a couple of feet, tapping in for birdie, but he followed that up by blazing his drive at 14 out of bounds. Oh Sergio! Wow, this storm is really doing a number on the course. It's lashing down, the skies almost totally dark, and the greens are collecting plenty of the water. Even when the weather breaks, the green staff will have a job of work on to get the course ready for play. The forecast's good for the rest of the week, mind. That's something to cling on to, no? It's probably worth pointing out that this delay could take some time. Because even if the storm was to peter out now - and it doesn't look like letting up any time soon, with lightning strobing away up above - the players have all been shuttled off to the facilities at Merion's west course, and it would take them a good 10-20 minutes to get back. It's pelting down at Merion. The place still looks gorgeous, though, even in the gloom. Those wicker baskets are something else. It was an idea the course architect, Hugh Wilson, picked up at Sunningdale while on a factfinding tour of Britain. The idea being, players wouldn't get assistance from a flag in judging the direction of the wind. Like the course isn't tricky enough as it stands. Should a ball somehow get lodged in a basket, players are allowed, within the Rules of Golf, to place the ball without penalty on the edge of the hole. I'd pay ready money to see the look on, say, Sergio's coupon if a stroke of good fortune like that benefitted his opponent on the final hole of a play-off. (We would calculate the chances of someone's ball getting wedged into a basket, multiplied by the likelihood of Garcia making it as far as a play off, but there aren't enough 0s in our computer.) There's one man who'll be happy the storm is passing over. Californian qualifier Roger Tambellini is +6 through the first six holes, having doubled 1, 5 and 6, bogeyed 4 and birdied 2, and may be in need of recalibrating several things inside his head. He'll have time to regroup now. And to think some folk are suggesting this short course will offer up a 62 this week! (That's an argument the players aren't having much truck with, incidentally; you should have seen the looks of incredulity on the faces of Ian Poulter, Darren Clarke and Rory McIlroy when the theory was put to them. Get your clubs out and show us how to do it, then, smartarse, seemed to be the long and short of it.) Tucked in behind Poulter is Nicolas Colsaerts, who has tickled in two lovely birdie putts, one at the gorgeous little 13th, another longer downhill effort at 14. He's -2 through 7 holes, alongside Charl Schwartzel, Tim Clark, and the first home player we mention this week, Charley Hoffman. For what it's worth, with the players in the clubhouse taking shelter, this is the early shape of the 113th US Open at Merion: -3: Poulter (3*) -2: Colsearts (7*), Schwartzel (4*), Clark (4*), Hoffman (2) -1: D Johnson (7*), Mahan (5), Stricker (5*), Coetzee (3), Manassero (2*), Palmer (1) Yes, here we go, that's what we said. Unfortunately, it's a bit of a false start; the players have been hauled off the course with thunder and lightening overhead. Merion's a very British style course, and we've got some links style weather right here. Oh dear. Never mind, we'll get our golf, it's just a matter of being patient. So here we go then, ladies and gentlemen; another four days of major championship golf. Or five, if we go to a play-off. Anyone up for a play-off? I wouldn't say no, either. A long way to go before anything like that happens, of course. Which is something Ian Poulter would do well to keep in mind. Starting at the 11th, he's off to a flier and is the early leader of the 113th US Open: birdie, birdie, birdie at 11, 12 and 13. He's -3! And about to play the treacherous closing five holes, so let's not get ahead of ourselves. The Impregnable Quadrilateral of Golf. That's what the Grand Slam was known as, back in the day. I know, it's much better, isn't it. Anyways, only one man has ever achieved one: Bobby Jones, back in 1930. The great American won the British Amateur on the Old Course at St Andrews, then the Open Championship at Hoylake, before sailing back to the States in the grand style on the SS Europa in time for the US Open, which he won at the Interlachen Country Club by raking in a 40-foot birdie putt on the last. All that was left was the US Amateur, the fourth \"major\" of the time. He set the seal on the deal with an 8&amp;7 rout of Eugene V Homans at Merion Cricket Club, just outside Philadelphia. The Impregnable Quadrilateral of Golf. There's only been one, and it was squared off at the venue of this year's US Open. Merion Golf Club (n\u00e9e Cricket Club) is arguably the most storied place in American golf. As well as Jones's Impregnable Quadrilateral, all four of the US Opens held here have been magnificent in their own way. In 1934, Olin Dutra pipped Gene Sarazen to the title from three back with nine to play, despite suffering from amoebic dysentry, having cashiered himself from hospital in order to compete. In 1971, Lee Trevino and Jack Nicklaus, the two hottest golfers in the world at the time, went toe-to-toe in a play-off mainly remembered now for Super Mex fannying around on the 1st tee with a rubber snake, a gag he'd been recycling all week as a satire on Merion's penal rough. Trevino prevailed by three shots. Ten years later, David Graham played arguably the greatest US Open round of all time, a masterclass of precision golf in the tournament which holds accuracy above all. But 1950 is the one. That's when Ben Hogan, 16 months after a head-on collision with a Greyhound bus, famously creamed a 1-iron into the heart of Merion's 18th green to force his way into a play-off that he'd eventually win. Given that doctors had initially thought Hogan would never walk again, the achievement was not far short of superhuman. Which isn't to say he didn't struggle. He had considered quitting with five holes of the final day's 36 to play, the pain in his legs too much to bear. \"I physically can't make it,\" he told his caddy. \"Don't worry, I'll pay you.\" His caddy responded by telling Hogan: \"I don't work for quitters. Meet you on the next tee.\" Exhausted and in acute pain, Hogan managed to stumble home, scraping into the play-off. With time to recover overnight, he beat George Fazio and Lloyd Mangrum to register one of the Homeric US Open wins. There's a fair chance Hogan would have pocketed an Impregnable Quadrilateral of his own in 1953. He won the Masters, the US Open and the Open, but simply couldn't compete in the PGA because the tournament - astonishing scheduling, this - overlapped with the Open. Tiger Woods - the hot favourite here this week - is of course the only man to get anywhere near an Impregnable Quadrilateral since. Some would say he actually did it, in 2000 and 2001, but holding all four majors isn't enough for some tragic pedants. Still, rules are rules, I suppose. Only reigning Masters champion Adam Scott can make it this year, seeing we're on the subject. But come along. Anyway, never mind Impregnable Quadrilaterals, we've four days of brilliance ahead of us, I'll be bound. Who'll follow in Webb Simpson's footsteps? Tiger? Lefty? G-Mac? DA Points? Sergio?
