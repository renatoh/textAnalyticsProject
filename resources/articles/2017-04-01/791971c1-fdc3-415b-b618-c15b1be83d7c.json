But demographically, Rochdale is unusual. For in this town north of Manchester, every 200th person is an asylum seeker. In asylum Britain, there is a rule: no town should have more than one asylum seeker for every 200 people. In Rochdale, the ratio is 0.99 per 200 - the most in England. For the local MP, Simon Danczuk, it is \u201cfar, far far too many\u201d. In areas, particularly in the north of town, such as Smallbridge and Wardleworth, many of the houses and flats are home to a proportion of the 1,061 asylum seekers who have been sent by the Home Office to live in Rochdale. \u201cI take the view that we should take in asylum seekers, that that\u2019s the right and proper thing for a country like Britain to do,\u201d says Danczuk. \u201cBut I think the dispersal system is wholly unfair. It\u2019s skewed towards towns like Rochdale.\u201d According to data published by the Guardian, the asylum dispersal scheme is heavily skewed towards poorer parts of the country. Rochdale ranks in the poorest 15% of the UK by median annual income. Some communities take more than 1,000 asylum seekers, whereas 174 local authorities \u2013 or 45% of all council areas \u2013 do not house any. The cost of housing asylum seekers and their \u00a336.95 weekly allowance is met by the Home Office, and asylum seekers are not accommodated in council housing. But local authorities that house asylum seekers are not given any additional funding to help cover costs such as schooling and health services. This puts, says Danczuk, additional strain on places such as Rochdale that are already struggling. He says: \u201cYou can\u2019t cut the funding to public services to towns and cities like Rochdale, like this government has done, and then expect us to take over 1,000 asylum seekers. It\u2019s absolutely outrageous actually, I feel very strongly about it.\u201d As do some of his constituents. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve come to the right place,\u201d says Phil Malpas when asked about asylum seekers. Malpas, who runs a floor-laying business, is concerned about the number of asylum seekers in Rochdale and does not think Britain has a responsibility to help refugees. \u201cNo responsibility. Why should I pay money to someone who hasn\u2019t given money to us?\u201d he says. \u201c[Immigrants] get everything given to them, everything for free; I don\u2019t get anything. It just seems to me that the working class, working people, are being hit the hardest by immigration.\u201d Nonetheless, at a nearby Red Cross drop-in centre, asylum seekers say they are grateful for the generosity Rochdale has shown them. Bakhtawer, an Iraqi Kurd, is full of praise for the town, which she says is full of \u201cvery good people who help us\u201d. With tears in her eyes, she gestures to Margaret White, a volunteer who is teaching her and her daughter to knit. \u201cHere, I am sad, I have no family, no mother, but she says, \u2018don\u2019t be sad\u2019, she is my mother here.\u201d But others are aware of an undercurrent of hostility. \u201cA woman who fled Iran because of her faith said to me: \u2018Sometimes my heart stops when I think people don\u2019t like us,\u2019\u201d says Mark Coleman, the vicar at St Chad\u2019s church, which runs a weekly welcome lunch. Debbie Callaghan, a volunteer, says there have been troubling incidents, though nothing akin to the recent attack on the 17-year-old asylum seeker Reker Ahmed in Croydon, south London. She points to a video shot by an asylum seeker from inside their flat, which shows people throwing eggs at their window from a park outside. \u201cThere\u2019s still people that aren\u2019t very nice in Rochdale,\u201d says Callaghan. \u201cThe majority of us stand together, it\u2019s the minority. We need to say we\u2019re all welcome.\u201d Callaghan says the way large parts of the community, particularly the Muslim community, have come together to support and welcome asylum seekers makes Rochdale \u201can example for the rest of the country\u201d. She highlights the rooms full of clothing, prams, beds and furniture donated by individuals or collected from mosques. \u201cFood, clothes, absolutely anything, I\u2019d get it straight away. Whatever I asked for, I\u2019d get it,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of these families have benefited from the kindness of the Muslims of Rochdale. They\u2019re amazing.\u201d Tahir Mahmood, the chairman of the Rochdale Council of Mosques, acknowledges there is a feeling of solidarity because many asylum seekers come from Muslim-majority countries, but he is quick to dismiss the idea that this is the motivation for helping. \u201cThere is a feeling, but we don\u2019t differentiate. There are Christians coming from Syria, it doesn\u2019t matter who it is, we would help anybody. We\u2019re all human beings \u2013 and we look at that first,\u201d he says. Ann Alger, 71, is \u201cRochdale born and bred\u201d. She says she does not know many asylum seekers, but thinks the government has a responsibility to help refugees. However, she is concerned about bringing more people to Rochdale when there are so few jobs and a feeling of general decline. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad town now. Everything\u2019s changed,\u201d she says, sitting on a bench near the closed down market where she used to manage a tea shop. \u201cI feel sorry for the young ones growing up here. \u201cMy friend was sick with cancer and this Pakistani woman came and brought food every day while she was sick, every day. That\u2019s real community. To be polite I\u2019ve learned a few words in Pakistani \u2013 \u2018hello\u2019, \u2018how are you\u2019. We should all do that and then we\u2019d all get on better. If one street can mix, why can\u2019t they all do it? It\u2019d be a better country, this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
