It is an unrejoicing poem of reluctant duty, \"sickened\" by the forced recourse to arms. Mullan misquotes: Kipling wrote \"Stand up and take [not 'meet'] the war\", emphasising the soldier's role as a stoical shield bearing the brunt of attack. In 1897 he had greeted the queen's jubilee with \"Recessional\", distancing himself from \"trust/ In reeking tube and iron shard\". To his cousin he wrote \"we're about the only power with a glimmer of civilisation in us ... All the same, we have no need to shout and yell and ramp about our strength ...\" Later in the war he produced the sombre \"Epitaphs of the war\", and the bitter indignation of \"Mesopotamia\": \"... the men who left them thriftily to die in their own dung,/ Shall they come with years and honour to the grave?\" George Schlesinger Durham Binding on Regarding the poor quality of books published in England (Letters, April 5), I recently bought Alistair Horne's wonderful Seven Ages of Paris, which I will use for many years to come. The text block is wavy because it has been printed on paper with the grain running across the page, a practice condemned in every book on printing and binding ever written. But this is not a new problem. In Henry Stevens's 1884 book Who Spoils Our English Books, the author blames the author, the publisher, the printer (reader, compositor and pressman individually), the paper-maker, ink-maker, bookbinder and not least the consumer, \"often ignorant and careless of the beauty and proportions of his book - a great sinner\". Perhaps a campaign for real books is required? Joe Martin London Dissenting believers For me, the most useful thing about Robert Grant's review of John Haldane's An Intelligent Person's Guide to Religion (\"All is for the best\", April 12) is the revelation that the book is not \"a survey of world religions\", though how a work with that title could fail to examine Hinduism and Buddhism defies comprehension. However, perhaps this does not worry Grant. His dismissive first sentence about the religions of China and Japan suggests that he holds eastern religions generally in low esteem. But it is precisely these ancient religions, besides which Christianity and Islam are newcomers, that go beyond arguments about which belief is right and which wrong. Bill Alexander Hartfield, West Sussex In his review of the Chief Rabbi's Haggadah (\"Pass the matza\" April 12) Ian Sansom expresses surprise and thinly veneered contempt for non-traditional haggadot but approvingly quotes the Chief Rabbi's description of the Passover story as having had greater influence than any other \"in inspiring revolution or evolution towards a just and humane society.\" The Passover story is indeed one of liberation, and like any good story can be told in a variety of ways. In the last 35 years it has had a particular poignancy for Jews opposed to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, when it is Palestinians who seek liberation from Israel. Ian Sansom mocks the idea of a West Bank and Gaza haggadah; this year Just Peace UK, a predominantly Jewish group campaigning for an end to the occupation will be holding a \"Third\" (alternative) seder precisely on this theme with Palestinian and other non-Jewish participants. Rayah Feldman London Clashes in the kitchen Whilst I enjoyed Julian Barnes' diatribe against the false expec tations set by cookbooks (\"Picture perfect\", April 12), I can't help feeling he has chosen an ill-judged target in Nigel Slater; in my experience, Nigel's recipes are invariably straightforward, and usually come out looking pretty much like the picture. In particular, \"Chops and Chicory\" is a wonderful dish, requiring a pinch of skill and a dash of judgement - a \"Real Recipe\", indeed! There is a saying about bad workmen and their tools - could that apply to Mr Barnes? Andrew Eaton Brighton If Julian Barnes is to claim the title of pedant he should learn the difference between chicory and endive. The tight pointed heads are chicory whereas endive looks like a lettuce on a bad hair day. Perhaps there is confusion because in French chicor\u00e9e is endive and endive is chicory? John Illingworth Bradford Analyse this David Farr (\"Off with their hats\", April 12) is so keen to label Dickens as a modernist - whatever that may mean - that his argument is frequently confused and lacking in historical sense. He asserts that \"Dickens seems unwittingly to have been drawn to the ideas of Freud\", which is remarkable given that Freud was 14 when Dickens died. Stephen Bailey Nottingham Lost for words If Pedro Werner (Letters, April 12) was unable to find antisemitism in the Horst Wessel Song, then he must have come across a censored version. The Nazis \"composed\" the vicious doggerel to their anthem but they used an already existing tune. It is believed that the melody was popular in 19th-century German fishing communities, although the original words are not known.
