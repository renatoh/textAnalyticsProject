Even gratins in Provence have a lightness of touch that you won't find farther north. 2 big bundles Swiss chard, washed Salt and pepper A little lemon juice 2 tsp butter 2 tsp plain flour 85ml milk 120ml double cream 1 bay leaf A sprig of fresh thyme, picked A scrape or two of nutmeg 100g Gruy\u00e8re, grated 1 clove garlic, peeled (optional) Trim the ends off the chard stalks, then strip off the leaves. Roughly chop the leaves and cut the stalks into bite-sized 3cm lengths. Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil, drop in the stalks and simmer for five to 10 minutes to soften (cooking time will depend on how thick they are). Add the leaves, cook for another minute or so, until wilted, then drain, refresh under cold water and drain again. Set aside to cool, then squeeze as much liquid from the leaves as you can. Season, add a squeeze of lemon juice and set aside. In a saucepan, melt the butter over a lowish heat, then stir in the flour. Continue stirring for two minutes or so, until the mixture comes together, then gradually stir in the milk and the cream. Add the bay leaf and thyme, bring slowly up to a boil, stirring all the while, simmer for five minutes, then remove from the heat. Season with salt, pepper and a grate or two of nutmeg, then stir in the cheese (if you want to make the sauce even richer, whisk in an egg yolk at this stage). Return to a low heat and cook, stirring, until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth. Remove the bay leaf. Heat the grill, or preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Butter a shallow oven dish. With the flat of a knife, lightly crush the garlic (if using), and rub it all over the insides of the dish. Lay in the chard stalks and leaves, distributing them evenly, then pour over the sauce. (If you want, sprinkle fresh breadcrumbs over the top to cover - they add a nice crunch to the finished dish.) Grill for five minutes or so, until lightly browned, or bake for 20 minutes to half an hour, until golden and bubbling. Serve with some good crusty country bread."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
