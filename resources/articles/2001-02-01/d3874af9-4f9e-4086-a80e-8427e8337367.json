Snowfall has been mainly north of the Alps. Lower slopes in many places have suffered rain. In North America there is good skiing nearly everywhere. Andorra Skiing was much better throughout after the previous week's heavy falls. Arcalis (110cm on lower slopes and 180cm higher up), Pal/Arinsal (70/105cm), Pas de la Casa (100/130cm) and Soldeu (80/140cm) all had good piste and powdery off-piste. Austria It enjoyed the dumps it needed last weekend: so much so that at St Anton (70/230cm) they had to postpone both downhills in the World Alpine Ski Championships. Pistes were excellent at midweek, resort runs fair and off-piste varied with considerable avalanche risk. Mayrhofen (0/133cm) had good pistes but off-piste was 'heavy' midweek. The resort is busy. A skier died in an avalanche at Hoch Fugen and the risk remains. Soll (65/100cm) had good pistes but heavy off-piste and slushy home runs. Kitzb\u00fchel (30/84cm) also suffered high temperatures, softening pistes and making lower runs heavy. Off-piste varied, with avalanche risks. Obergurgl (75/90cm) was great on piste, not so good off it. Bulgaria Operators says Borovets (20/50cm) and Pamporovo (32/45cm) aren't as bad as they seem. Canada Whistler (150/195cm) had soft-packed pistes and variable off-piste. Lake Louise (65/102cm) had enjoyed 38cm of snow in seven days. More snow at Tremblant (98/113cm) meant good pistes and packed off-piste. France Val d'Is\u00e8re (88/220cm), which is 'quite busy', was sunny midweek with good pistes and off-piste and conditions were expected to improve. Chamonix (40/160cm) was warm midweek. There was an avalanche at Le Tour on Tuesday and five Norwegians skiing just over the border in Switzerland met trouble in the Combe de Jeurs. One was killed, another was missing, a third injured. Two Belgian snowboarders were killed by avalanche on Brevent last weekend, and there are still high risks. A storm tomorrow will be followed by better weather on Tuesday. Alpe d'Huez (70/210cm), Avoriaz (120/150cm), Flaine (40/280cm), La Plagne (130/190cm) and M\u00e9ribel (50/110cm) had good piste skiing and reasonable off-piste after early-week snow, but lower runs suffered. Italy Holding its own but not much new snow. Bormio (35/270cm), Cervinia (90/300cm),Cortina (30/250cm), Courmayeur (100/300cm), Livigno (130/320cm), Sauze d'Oulx (80/140cm) and Selva (15/160cm). Norway Still rather cold. Hemsedal (120/190cm) is doing well, also Geilo (125/140cm). Only Voss (35/45cm) had improved depths, but still not enough. Spain Sierra Nevada (120/300cm), Europe's most southerly resort, has got plenty of snow but was closed midweek by high winds. Further North, Baqueira Beret (120/210cm), a favourite with King Carlos, had excellent pistes after fresh snow but mild temperatures were worrying. La Molina (40/110cm), to the east in the Pyrenees, was rather too sunny and conditions were best higher up the slopes. Switzerland Grindlewald (25/115cm) suffered from warm winds and high temperatures attacking the snow base and creating avalanche risks high up and slushy runs low down, as did Davos (65/160cm), St Moritz (115/275cm), Verbier (55/130cm) and Wengen (20/110cm). In Zermatt (55/220cm) lower runs were hard. US: Winter Park (147/157cm) in Colorado had 10cm of fresh snow in the first three days of last week, to give a total so far this winter of 561cm. All pistes were good and off-piste was powder. Most resorts have enjoyed fresh snow as these midweek, mid-mountains depths reflect: Aspen, which was expecting more through to Tuesday, recorded 94cm, Breckenridge 104cm, Copper Mountain 116cm, Keystone 106cm and Vail 109cm. Wyoming's Jackson Hole (135cm) opened the notorious Corbett's Couloir last Wednesday. Idaho's Sun Valley (127cm) was very cold with packed powder as was Montana's Big Sky (132cm). California Mammoth (120/180cm) had good pistes and off-piste powder after good snowfalls, while Heavenly (80/130cm) was enjoying great skiing. In the East, Stowe (80/130cm) had good but chilly skiing. On the slopes The singer Seal - remember 'Kiss from a Rose' - was snowboarding at Winter Park, Colorado. Best skiing Next weekend is the start of the school half-term holidays and most operators are sold out. But Alpine Ski Tours (01227 454777) had late availability midweek for skiing on the Stubai Glacier in Austria, departing by coach on Saturday for six days' fully inclusive ski holiday, half board, at \u00a3399. \u0095 The AITO directory of ski operators, whose reps help with this report, is available free by calling 020 8607 9080."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
