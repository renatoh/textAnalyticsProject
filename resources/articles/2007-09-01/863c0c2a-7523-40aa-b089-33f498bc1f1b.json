Fluid and well-balanced, Steve McClaren's side were unrecognisable from the XI whose lumpen display against the same opponents in Tel Aviv contributed so much to their perilous position in Group E. For two interested parties watching from homes in Cheshire and the Hollywood Hills, however, England's victory would not have made entirely comfortable viewing. With Shaun Wright-Phillips and Micah Richards combining effectively on England's right flank and both scoring, Gary Neville and David Beckham will have been excused for wondering if their international careers might be at an end. For a decade the pair have been fixtures for England, as reliable on their country's right flank as they were for Manchester United. Since Beckham followed his best friend into the national side against Moldova in September 1996 they have started together for England 62 times and amassed 182 caps between them. None of the England managers under whom they have played have felt able to dispense with both when selecting their best side. Now, however, with England's qualifying campaign reaching its endgame and both recuperating from injury, they face permanent displacement by a young duo whose careers were developed across Manchester in City's sky blue. McClaren has been here before of course. He tried to break the Neville-Beckham duopoly when he succeeded Sven-Goran Eriksson, dropping Beckham from his first squad claiming the former captain did not satisfy his new priorities of pace and width. Within a year it looked an empty gesture as several potential successors including Wright-Phillips failed to establish themselves. Beckham was recalled in June, apparently certain to fulfil his ambition of 100 England caps. Three months on and stalled on 97 caps he cannot be so sure. A knee injury is expected to keep him out until mid-October when McClaren will announce his squad for the qualifiers against Estonia and Russia, leaving November's tie against Croatia as the final competitive game ahead of Euro 2008. Should Beckham miss that too his prospects of travelling to the finals may rest on his value as a squad player. Neville's prognosis is not quite so bleak - he is expected to return to training later this month - but while a berth in the squad is not seriously in question his place in the starting XI is. The reason, simply, is that Wright-Phillips and Richards have seized their chance. They were at the heart of England's best competitive performance under McClaren, providing dynamism and an attacking threat, and aged only 25 and 19 respectively they have the opportunity to monopolise the positions to the 2010 World Cup and beyond. Wright-Phillips was a constant menace to Yoav Ziv, providing a steady supply of chances to Michael Owen and Emile Heskey. If Wright-Phillips's performance was that of a player who has taken time to acclimatise to international football, Richards's was that of a prodigy. He appears utterly unfazed by the step up and, as he did when playing with Beckham against Germany last month, spent almost as much time beyond his winger as he did in support. And the few times he had to deal with Israel attacks he did so with ease. McClaren, at last enjoying the luxury of competition for Beckham's place, was delighted with Wright-Phillips and equally effusive about Richards. Worryingly for Neville he did not list the Manchester United club captain among the five \"major players\" that were missing at the weekend. \"You always get a feeling from the first day of training,\" he said of Richards. \"You can tell whether you have a character. Can they handle the occasion? Can they mix well? Have they got the character?.\" Rio Ferdinand backed up his manager's praise for Wright-Phillips. \"At the moment Shaun is probably the most important player going forward in the Premier League. He is playing very well for his club and bringing that on to the international scene as well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
