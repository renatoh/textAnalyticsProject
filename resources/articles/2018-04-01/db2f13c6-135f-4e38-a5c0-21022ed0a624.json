David Lammy, the Labour MP who spoke passionately about the Home Office\u2019s treatment of the Windrush generation on Monday, said the document demonstrated the government\u2019s \u201ccallous attitude towards thousands of people who have made their lives here and harks back to campaigns for \u2018repatriation\u2019 of migrants\u201d. The guide, produced in 2013, offers a list of dos and don\u2019ts for people being deported to Jamaica, including the tip: \u201cTry to be \u2018Jamaican\u2019 \u2013 use local accents and dialect\u201d. It also reveals the name of the Jamaican currency and the names of some major Jamaican television stations and newspapers. \u201cHow exactly can someone pretend to \u2018be Jamaican\u2019 when they are British and have lived here all their lives?\u201d asked Lammy. After the pamphlet came to light on Monday, he told the Guardian: \u201cThis document was published when Theresa May was home secretary, proudly promoting her hostile environments policy \u2013 the starting point for the injustices that we are seeing writ large for the Windrush generation. \u201cIt is hard to believe that this document was written, approved and published. The very fact that the government feels that this is an appropriate way to treat the ancestors of those Caribbean pioneers who were invited to Britain as citizens tells its own sad story about the treatment of immigrants in our country.\u201d While the government says it is intended for people it believes to be from Jamaica, the leaflet includes basic information that is likely to be familiar with anyone from the country. It reveals that \u201celectrical appliances use plugs that are two-pronged and flat\u201d and advises deportees that \u201coverseas accents can attract unwanted attention\u201d. The guide was put together by charities and non-governmental organisations in Jamaica, with the support of the British and Jamaican governments. The Home Office said the dos and don\u2019ts section was written by a Jamaican NGO. A Home Office spokeswoman said: \u201cThis document has nothing to do with people from the Windrush generation, who are in the UK legally.\u201d The Guardian has reported on numerous examples in which the department told people of the Windrush generation it considered them to be in the UK illegally. In addition, when questioned about her department\u2019s approach to that group on Monday, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, told MPs: \u201cFrankly, how they have been treated has been wrong \u2013 has been appalling \u2013 and I am sorry.\u201d The spokeswoman added: \u201cAs the home secretary has made clear today, the Home Office has set up a dedicated team to help people from that group to get the right paperwork to confirm their status in the UK. \u201cThis particular document was intended to provide advice for people who have been in the UK illegally and are returning to Jamaica either voluntarily or through deportation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
