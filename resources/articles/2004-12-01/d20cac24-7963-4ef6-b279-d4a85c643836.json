He passed away peacefully yesterday evening. His nephew, George Ritchie, said he would be sadly, greatly missed. Lord Scarman is most closely associated with his inquiry into the 1981 Brixton riots. Nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight during three days of disturbances that spread to the Midlands, Merseyside, Bristol and Leeds. His report tagged some police as racist and resulted in the establishment of the Police Complaints Authority. He was radicalised by meeting socially disadvantaged residents of south London, and sought to understand the roots of the mistrust the black community felt for the police. His theory that racism in the police force was down to a few bad apples would be rejected 17 years later by William Macpherson, who chaired the inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. The Macpherson report's conclusion that the Metropolitan police force was institutionally racist sparked a new era of reform. Lord Scarman enjoyed a distinguished judicial career, serving as chairman of the Law Commission during its first seven years. He also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in Northern Ireland. He was born Leslie George Scarman on July 29 1911 and attended Radley College then Brasenose College, Oxford. He became a barrister in 1936 and a QC in 1957 before becoming a High Court Judge and then sitting in the Appeal Court. He is survived by Lady Ruth Scarman, whom he married in 1947."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
