The 32-year-old winger, who has now retired from club rugby and will bring down the curtain on his career after this autumn's World Cup, has never faced the Springboks on their own patch and is looking forward to putting down a marker ahead of England's defence of the Webb Ellis Trophy. \"I've never been to South Africa before and it will be nice to have some good tracks to run on over here,\" said Robinson, who is looking to increase his international haul of 26 tries. \"This is a massive year for me and I want to play at my very best. It will be a massive challenge, but it is a big opportunity for the boys and we all want to play our very best. Hopefully we will put up a good fight and enjoy ourselves at the same time.\" Barring injury, Robinson is almost certain of his place in Brian Ashton World Cup squad, but for many of his 29 team-mates, this tour - which sees matches against South Africa on May 26 in Bloemfontein and June 2 in Pretoria - is more about September than merely embellishing their career statistics. The England coach is adamant the tour is meaningful ahead of the team's defence of the title they won in Sydney in 2003. He said: \"There is still time for a lot to be achieved before the World Cup and this tour is required as part of our build-up, just like it is part of South Africa's build-up.\" \"I am still looking to finalise the World Cup squad and there is still a lot of work to be done before the training squad is named at the end of June. We have a group of players over here who will be doing everything they can to make that training squad and there is a group of players at home who will be doing the same.\" The Springboks will be at full strength for the double header and Ashton expects a fierce struggle. \"We only need to look at the Super-14, where the final will be between two South African teams for the first time ever. That speaks volumes for the potential strength the Springboks will take into the World Cup. We have massive respect for them and playing them here, at altitude, is a big ask, one of the biggest challenges in rugby,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
