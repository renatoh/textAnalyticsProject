Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Whittingdale, an outspoken critic of the BBC, said a \u201cvery robust system\u201d was needed to ensure the broadcaster\u2019s coverage was impartial. \u201cWhether or not the present governance is the right way of dealing with it \u2013 the fact that questions of impartiality are judged by the BBC Trust \u2013 that is an area which I want to think about, because all the other broadcasters have an external regulator looking at the impartiality question,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the bigger question of the way in which the BBC is governed.\u201d The culture secretary said in the interview that he did not have a vendetta against the broadcaster. \u201cI think the BBC has an incredibly difficult job, in that political parties are always going to be looking for signs that the BBC \u2013 indeed not just the BBC, but any broadcaster \u2013 is not acting in an wholly impartial way,\u201d he said. \u201cI think sometimes my party had cause for complaint. I suspect that it may well be the case that sometimes the Labour party had cause for complaint.\u201d Conservative figures have complained of a leftwing bias at the BBC, an accusation that was recently rejected by corporation\u2019s head of news, James Harding. Whittingdale, who is expected to take a tough stance against the BBC when charter renewal negotiations begin, said it needed to be made \u201cfit for the new broadcasting age we are moving into\u201d. When Whittingdale was named culture secretary, the Times and the Telegraph led with his appointment of their front pages, with the latter saying the Tories had gone to war with the BBC. But the culture secretary rejected this suggestion: \u201cIt never was the case that I was going in to go to war with the BBC \u2026 I am critical of the BBC. I also think there are areas where clearly there is a strong case for change, not least because the landscape is looking so different. But it isn\u2019t a sort of vendetta or a punishment exercise or anything like that.\u201d He would not be drawn on the future of BBC funding, but said he was waiting for the outcome of a report by David Perry QC into the possibility of decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. He said: \u201cIf [David Perry] comes back and recommends going down that road \u2013 or if we decide to go down that road \u2013 that immediately has implications for the way the licence fee works. We\u2019re waiting to see that report.\u201d Explaining his famous comment that the licence fee was \u201cworse than the poll tax\u201d, he said: \u201cIt might be naivety, but I have a slight cause for surprise that it was regarded as such a controversial statement. Because what I was doing was stating what seems to me a statement of fact. \u201cThere are arguments for the licence fee and there are arguments against the licence fee. But one of the criticisms of the licence fee is that it is a flat-rate charge, which every household up to 75 has to pay. There is no assistance available \u2013 which actually under the [poll tax] there was. It takes no account of people\u2019s income or wealth. It is in that sense highly regressive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
