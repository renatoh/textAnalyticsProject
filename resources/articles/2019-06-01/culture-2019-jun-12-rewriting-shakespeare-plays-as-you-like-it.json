Are they in danger of dying? If Nicholas Hytner\u2019s production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream at the Bridge Theatre, London, is anything to go by, the text is alive and well. The point about textual rhythm is paramount and it might be as crucial to Shakespeare\u2019s plays as rhythms are in a Beethoven symphony, which nobody would be advised to alter in performance. But it should not deter reimaginings of Shakespeare or Beethoven by artists who are inspired to present them in a fresh version, which will reach out to a wider audience. Let\u2019s not infer, however, that Shakespeare needs to be resuscitated for the millions who continue to be enchanted by his texts in their original form. Nicholas Kraemer London \u2022 I couldn\u2019t agree more Alex Clark, \u201c\u2026 consciously widening a work of art\u2019s capacity is \u2026 an act of fidelity towards the work itself\u201d. As Martin Carthy says of folk tunes, change does them no harm; the only damage you can do them is not to play them. And the canon that is Shakespeare was once but airy words delivered from a timber scaffold into the fetid air of the stinkards pit. The first texts were cobbled from a rattle-bag of scraps, pirated copies and fading memories years after they first saw the light of day. Why be precious about the texts when we have the plays? Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire \u2022 It is a bit strange for Alex Clark to use the casting of a young man to play Ophelia as an example of \u201crewriting the Bard\u201d so as to \u201cmake the text live again\u201d. Surely in this instance this casting involved returning to the original way the play was performed?
