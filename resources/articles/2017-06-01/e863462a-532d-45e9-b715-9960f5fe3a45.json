Now, Adele rounds off her 25 tour with four nights at Wembley hosting 98,000 people a night \u2013 a stadium record for a music event \u2013 coming to commune in the emotional Big Four: love, anger, sorrow, joy. Having told the world earlier in the day on Instagram: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever tour again, and so I want my last time to be at home,\u201d feelings are running higher still, and the ros\u00e9 has been poured in readiness. Lips are wobbled further by Grenfell. Adele has spent time there meeting residents and firefighters, and her first appearance of the night is on screen appealing for donations. She dedicates Make You Feel My Love to a man called Abraham who was on the ground helping residents, and tells the crowd: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have social conscience, you can grow one.\u201d It\u2019s arresting, but more so is London-pride anthem Hometown Glory (arguably chucked away too early in the set) that generates a hot adrenal jolt of grief as the tower\u2019s burned husk looms onto screen. Adele knows, though, that most of her songs can\u2019t be transmuted into moments of civic healing; nor are many of them even midtempo \u2013 \u201chave a little dance because you ain\u2019t got much of a chance for the rest of the set\u201d, she says ahead of Rumour Has It. No, most are piano-centric and, as she says, \u201cabout dickheads\u201d. Some of her lovelorn lamentations (Don\u2019t You Remember, Take It All) waft along, but her A-grade material creates a gigantic vent for the injustice of lost love. Take Rolling in the Deep\u2019s \u201cwe could have had it all\u201d, rising into clarity, or the middle eight of Set Fire to the Rain, which is animated by the kind of bewilderment that sends the brokenhearted pacing pointlessly around the streets at night. All of this is delivered with masterful \u2013 and creative \u2013 vocal control. Wembley\u2019s cavernous acoustic suits her too, adding to the sense of emotional chaos with vocals lightly echoing back on her. But it\u2019s her rambling streams of banter between songs that turn this into a show, skewering the grace of a filmed underwater sequence by saying she was channelling Kate Winslet and the Little Mermaid, comparing popcorn bags to sex dolls, and of course not so much peppering as salting the entire event with a stream of F-bombs; her very first words on stage are: \u201cFuck me, I\u2019ve never been so fucking scared in my entire life.\u201d Her acknowledgement of Grenfell\u2019s physical and psychological wounds was worthy, but crucially she also applied a balm, and with laughter as much as anything. \u201cI might never see you again at a live show, but I\u2019ll remember this for the rest of my life,\u201d she says at one point; and it would be a shame if this is the last stage that this instinctively charismatic performer ever sees. At Wembley stadium, London, until 2 July. Box office: 0800-169 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
