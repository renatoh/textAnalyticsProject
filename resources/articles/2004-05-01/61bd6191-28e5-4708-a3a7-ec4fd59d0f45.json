Mr Blunkett admitted to MPs that it would be possible to register for the identity card in a false name using forged or stolen documents but he warned that if somebody tried it they would be stuck with that false identity for the rest of their lives. The home secretary was giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee inquiry into the national identity card bill which is expected to be introduced into parliament this autumn. He also disclosed that the Passport Service trial of the new \"biometric\" had already run into problems and warned that Scottish politicians might face a popular backlash if they decided not to use a compulsory ID card scheme to control access to public services. But Mr Blunkett, buoyed by recent polls showing that the idea had the support of more than 80% of voters, predicted that people would be queueing up to renew their passports early when they became a combined identity card in three years' time. Some experts have warned that those who use false identity documents to register at its start will avoid detection. Mr Blunkett acknowledged that this was a possibility: \"If they provide false papers then they will have to keep that false identity for the rest of their lives. \"People who adopted a false identity better get their true identity pretty quickly otherwise they are going to find themselves in a real mess to establish a real identity for life.\" He predicted that those who kept a false identity would face problems with their family and their heritage and even with their inheritance rights. Mr Blunkett said the personal details of those who died after being registered would be retained on the database to guard against fraudsters adopting false identities. Evidence submitted by the Passport Service to the MPs published yesterday shows that the ID biometric enrolment trials have been hit by a \"series of hardware, software and ergonomic problems\". The trials, which will include 10,000 volunteers, are now due to finish in August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
