Bishop said she had settled the legal framework during meetings with Iraqi government leaders in Baghdad on Saturday and Sunday, about a month after the special forces members were sent to the Middle East. They would \u201cadvise and assist\u201d the Iraqi security forces to build up their capacity to fight Islamic State (Isis) militants, rather than becoming directly involved in combat operations. In mid-September, the government sent 200 special forces members and 400 air force personnel to the United Arab Emirates in anticipation of further decisions to formally approve Australia\u2019s commitment to the US-led coalition against Isis. Australian F/A-18 Super Hornets began missions over Iraq in early October, but arrangements to allow the special forces into the country took longer to complete. Bishop said in Baghdad on Sunday: \u201cI have finalised agreement for a legal framework to enable our special forces to be deployed here to advise and assist the Iraqi government in building up the capacity of the Iraqi security forces. \u201cWe have reached agreement for a legal framework and now it will be a matter for our military to determine when our special forces will be deployed, so it will be an operational matter from now on.\u201d Bishop told the ABC on Monday that officials still needed to work on administrative and logistical matters \u201cbut the way is now clear for our special forces to be deployed to Iraq for the purposes of training, advising and assisting the Iraqi security forces\u201d. Asked about the situation on the ground in Iraq, Bishop said the Iraqi government was \u201cconfident of holding Baghdad\u201d but the situation was tense. \u201cIndeed this morning when I was speaking with our staff at the embassy we heard a bomb go off in Baghdad,\u201d she said. \u201cOvernight there have been further bomb attacks and a number of people killed here in Baghdad so the situation is exceedingly dangerous and that\u2019s why we urge Australians not to travel to Iraq and if they are here to leave unless they have arrangements in place with their employers. \u201cIt is a dangerous place here in Baghdad and of course in the other areas of Iraq we are seeing the activities of Isil [Islamic State]: the executions, the mass killings. They are a murderous and brutal organisation that must be stopped, and that\u2019s why the Australian government along with many other governments around the world have been prepared to provide support to the Iraqi government so that it can protect all of its citizens from this brutal organisation.\u201d The minister said she was pleased the Iraqi cabinet was now in place. The international coalition expected the Iraqi government to be inclusive, protect the rights of all of the Iraqi citizens, and take up the fight against Isis. \u201cI emphasised the importance of the Iraqi government\u2019s efforts to deliver policies that share power and resources amongst Iraq\u2019s various communities,\u201d Bishop said in her statement. \u201cI also met groups of minority leaders to hear their concerns and to underline Australia\u2019s close interest in the protection of minorities in Iraq.\u201d Bishop said during her visit she had received briefings from Iraqi leaders and international coalition partners on the campaign against Isis and the current political situation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
