It is a campaign supported by both the Conservative environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, and her Labour predecessor, Hilary Benn. There is no political divide in a transparently straightforward attempt to protect biodiversity and the natural heritage that has been steadily eroded: in the past three years one new home in four was built in what were gardens, an unintended consequence of a policy meant to reduce pressure on greenfield sites. Sadly, the context in which such valued places are put at risk is more complicated and much more contentious. Homes are too expensive because there are not enough of them. Last year, according to the Home Builders' Federation, fewer new homes were built than in any peacetime year since 1923. But at the same time, economists \u2013 not least on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee \u2013 anxiously monitor house prices. Rising values mean fewer repossessions and happy homeowners. Bad news, then, that the latest Halifax house price index yesterday showed a slowdown in prices, with worse predicted. On the other hand, it is the soaring cost of homes over the past 10 years, together with a prolonged standstill in the building of council-owned housing, that has contributed to levels of housing benefit for tenants in the private rented sector that are now declared unsustainable. It is also behind David Cameron's wrong-headed proposal to end security of tenure for council tenants, even though social renters are least likely of everyone to be over-housed. Labour's planning policy was intended to supply housing where it was most needed. Regional strategies were to ensure enough sustainable new homes to meet demand, particularly in the hard-pressed south-east and south-west. House prices would become affordable. Now, some economists argue that it was never in the interests of house builders to increase supply to the point at which house prices began to fall. Others always argued against the strategy of piling investment into the fastest-growing regions of the UK. But there were advantages to the widely unloved policy, not least that it delivered something like \u00a35bn into affordable housing, although, as Shelter has argued, that was never enough to help the most vulnerable, those neither poor enough for housing benefit nor rich enough even for shared-equity ownership. The Conservatives were elected on a promise to abolish what they saw as a top-down overcentralised planning regime. But now the regional strategies are gone, their advantages are becoming apparent, if only because no one knows what criteria will govern planning next. On Wednesday, an improbable rainbow coalition of environmentalists, house builders and planners protested to the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, about the vacuum he had created. Their letter, co-ordinated by the Town Planning Institute, questioned how \"localism\" \u2013 allowing individual councils to decide their own planning regimes \u2013 will meet the extraordinarily complex range of concerns from transport and energy to jobs and flooding that regional strategies had slowly come to co-ordinate. The old policy was far from perfect, but without it local councils are gleefully halting unpopular housing schemes at the risk of rebooting the house price spiral. The government promises a national planning framework but it is not yet spelt out. It is possible that local enterprise partnerships may come to offer the co-ordinated approach to planning which, at their best, was provided by the old regional strategies. Whatever happens next, there is no perfect answer. What is clear is that planning is likely to challenge the limits of localism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
