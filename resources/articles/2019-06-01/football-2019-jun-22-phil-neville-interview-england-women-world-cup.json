England\u2019s coach reveals that his reward for choreographing the 2-0 victory against Japan in Nice last week was a rare exemption from a daily 6am run. \u201cI went for a swim instead,\u201d says the now deeply tanned Lionesses coach. \u201cIt was great.\u201d It is not yet 10am in the wooded hills above Antibes but already a searingly hot sun warms the circular pool visible through the plate glass doors behind him. Not that Neville is in holiday mode. His side have won three games out of three and, having topped their group, face Cameroon in Sunday\u2019s last-16 match at the other end of France in Valenciennes, but nagging doubts linger. The Lionesses are a little goal-shy while passages of convincing play are sometimes tempered by prolonged slapdash interludes. \u201cYes, it does frustrate me,\u201d acknowledges Neville, who preaches a slick passing, possession game. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something that may take a long time to achieve, that total domination for 90 minutes. I sometimes expect more of them \u2026 but maybe no team can do it for 90 minutes. \u201cMy expectation levels are probably higher than what\u2019s achievable. But I have to keep pushing the standards. And so far I\u2019ve seen nothing in this tournament that gives me fear. I\u2019ve seen nothing that makes me go: \u2018Oh dear me, if we play them we\u2019re going to struggle.\u2019\u201d Not that he is underestimating Cameroon. \u201cOur biggest tests are going to be against teams like that, the teams that we\u2019re expected to beat but will sit low and really try to stifle us,\u201d he says. \u201cMy players are looking forward to the games where teams will come out at us, give us more spaces to play and to counterattack. But it\u2019s been a fantastic tournament in terms of the quality. \u201cThe goalkeeping has been unbelievable. We\u2019ve played against three goalkeepers who have produced saves I\u2019ve never seen in women\u2019s football.\u201d The heightened calibre of competition has partly informed Neville\u2019s penchant for rotation. No coach in France has refreshed his side more than England\u2019s. He explains the eight changes he made in the defeat of Japan stemmed from a decision to profile tactically each squad member. \u201cWe pick players on their profiles,\u201d he says. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve learned that, if you have one cog that\u2019s not quite right in the system, that flow of how you want to play can\u2019t work. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a centre-back that can\u2019t dribble the ball out in a certain game, you can\u2019t have tactics to play from the back. It\u2019s why we change our goalkeeper sometimes. The profiles of Karen Bardsley and Carly Telford are really different. It\u2019s not science, it\u2019s common sense, it\u2019s playing the right players in the right positions for the style of football you want to implement in a specific game.\u201d It is an ideology provoked by conversations with Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. \u201cI remember him talking about the importance of playing a left-footed centre-back,\u201d says Neville. \u201cIf you have a right-footed one on the left the movement isn\u2019t as quick or as smooth. I thought long and hard about Van Gaal\u2019s analysis and it\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s why I pick players for certain reasons.\u201d Indeed form does not necessarily inform team sheets. \u201cForm helps,\u201d says Neville. \u201cBut I go on the basis that I trust the player in a particular game, more than saying: \u2018You\u2019re not in form, so you\u2019re not playing.\u2019 The players think it helps them to perform if you put the right people around them. Georgia Stanway did very well against Japan but she had players around her who helped her perform the way she did.\u201d Some say his team lack the nasty streak apparently patented by a formidably ruthless USA, potential semi-final opponents. \u201cThe USA have got that run-over-anyone-to-get-that-victory mindset,\u201d says Neville. \u201cYou see that in what they all demand from each other. They\u2019ve got the best mentality. That\u2019s what winning teams do; they\u2019re not afraid to fall out with each other. When I first came into this job there was a real niceness around the camp but I encourage my players to challenge each other.\u201d It would be difficult to spend any time in his company and not conclude that Neville is almost unfailingly nice. Sometimes this aspect of his character makes the job tough. \u201cThe hardest bit is team selection,\u201d he agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest five-minute meeting you\u2019ll ever have. When you care for a set of players that does leave something on you. That\u2019s the ruthless side I\u2019ve now got to produce. Our style of play is non-negotiable but we also have to become ruthless serial winners. \u201cThat\u2019s why players sometimes need to give each other an old-fashioned bollocking. You can\u2019t go through a game without saying to someone: \u2018Come on, you need to be better than that, your passing needs to be better, work harder, stay with runners.\u2019 It can\u2019t always be: \u2018Thanks, well done\u2019 nicey-nicey. Yes, there are certain standards and tones of voice we want them to use with each other. That\u2019s a respect thing but they are demanding of each other now, they\u2019re self-managing and self-policing. \u201cWe now have a team that goes into a huddle and calls each other out, challenges each other and sorts out problems for themselves.\u201d Stylistically and tactically England may remain a work in progress but it sounds as if Neville has mastered the art of delegation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
