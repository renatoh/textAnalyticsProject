Another kind of family murderousness is on display here in Bellocchio's new film: an account of the dismal life of Ida Dalser, Mussolini's lover, mother of his child, and \u2013 according to some sources \u2013 his first wife. It really is a sad story: Dalser was besotted by the young, fervent Mussolini, then a rising star of the socialist faction, and their son was born in 1915. Mussolini, meanwhile, married Rachele Guidi the same year, and they were still married when he rose to power in 1922. Dalser was forcibly confined to a psychiatric hospital as she continued to loudly claim the dictator was her husband; but no paperwork was ever forthcoming to prove it. She died in 1937 \u2013 arguably a case of institutional murder \u2013 while her son died five years later. Bellocchio, whose last film was about the assassination of Aldo Moro, gets stuck into this long-suppressed political hot potato; and in the first half, with Filippo Timi channelling the young Duce to great effect \u2013 we are asked to see Mussolini's political ambition as an extension of his sexual drive. (\"Vincere\", to win, applies in both cases.) The momentum drops sharply, however, when Mussolini gains power and vanishes from Dalser's life, and the film, too \u2013 though Timi reappears briefly as Mussolini junior. The screenplay is unkind to lead actor Giovanna Mezzogiorno, requiring her to replay the same obsessive behaviour in less-than-inspiring locales, and all the film's energy just fizzles out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
