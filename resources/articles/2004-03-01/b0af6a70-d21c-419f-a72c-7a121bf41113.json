And still you come here in your droves to read it instead, and torment me in the process. Both teams are wearing their home strips. Scott Parker and Damien Duff will be marshalling the right and left sides of the Chelsea midfield respectively, as if you didn't know. 1 min: Chelsea kick off playing from left to right, as you look at it on the telly none of you appear to have. Damien Duff falls victim to Patrick Vieira's trademark fancy move: tipping the ball over somebody's head then darting around them to pick ut up again. It's in the middle of the field so nothing comes of it. Pires concedes a free-kick out on the right wing, which Duff takes. Arsenal clear. 3 min: Chelsea attack down the right wing, courtesy of Mutu. He attempts to put in a cross, but it's blocked and Chelsea win a throw-in deep in the opposition half. Arsenal clear. 4 mins: Arsenal win the first corner of the match, but succceed only in conceding a throw deep in Chelsea territory. The ball is sent back to Ambrosio, who hoofs it up the field. 6 mins: An Ambrosio punt gets two flick-ons in quick succession, finding its way to Gudjohnsen just outside the Arsenal box. They clear, launch a sortie into the Chelsea half and Bergkamp gets the first shot of any description on target. His low, weak effort is saved easily by Ambrosio. 8 mins: Two offsides in quick succession, with Arsenal narrowly losing out on both occasions. The closest was Pires, who was put through one-on-one with Ambrosio, who saved his effort well anyway. Replays show both decisions to have been correct, although they were tighter than a camel's rectum. 10 mins: Arsenal win a free-kick which is swung oin from the left hand side. At the far post, Sol Campbell gets a free header but puts it wide. It was an absolute sitter and he should have scored. 12 mins: Not a great deal in it at the moment, but Arsenal are winning on points. Meanwhile, Tony Long writes with a tale of tyrant-induced woe: \"I am in an office in Rockville just outside Washington DC and my evil boss won't let me go and watch the game on TV,\" he moans. \"Even though she (lets call her Sue) knows I am just going to sit here and press F5 every 10 seconds instead, she won't take pity on me. Will these people not realise that I am better off outside the office not disturbing people and gibbering on about 'soccer' and wasting the company bandwidth?\" At least you have your health Tony. Well, your physical health. 14 mins: Despite pre-match concerns that he might be a bit fussy - what with him being Johnny Foreigner and all that - Spanish referee, Senor Manuel Enrique Mejuto Gonzalez, is letting the match ebb and flow without sticking his oar in. It's not dirty, but there are a few crunchy tackles going in here and there. Yes you, Mr Makelele. And don't think I haven't seen what you're up to Mr Edu! 16 mins: This from Martin Fahy: \"Barry, what are the chances of getting more frequent updates than you normally deliver?\" I'd say they're excellent, Martin, as long as people don't waste my time with frivolous, whining emails about the frequency of my updates. Kolo Toure puts a stop to Damien Duff's gallop with a bonecruncher. Great tackle. 21 minutes: Makelele plays a long ball from just inside his own half, which Eidur Gudjohnsen flicks on. The ball takes a deflection off Sol Campbell and falls nicely for Scott Parker who has a pop from distance. Gah! Rubbish. Why did he bother? 22 mins: \"Er, just how are you acquainted with the tightness of a camel's rectum?\" asks Heather Johnson. I see where you're coming from there, Heather. I kind of walked into that one. Suffice to say it's not what I think you think. 26 mins: Poor defending from Robert Pires allows Scott Parker to pull a ball back from the byline and into the six-yard box. Jens Lehmann sticks an arm out and grabs it before anyone in a blue shirt can blast it past him. The ball, that is. Not their blue shirt. 29 mins: Camels rectums are tight, to keep sand out. Now could the several hundred of you who have joined Heather Johnson in wanting to know why I'm so learned on the subject of camel physiology please let it go. Ljungberg wins a free-kick in midfield as a result of an allegedly injudicious Mutu lunge. Looked alright to me. 31 mins: Mutu leaves Toure for dead, hares down the left wing and shoots from a narrow angle. No trouble for Lehmann. Arsenal break and Bergkamp has a half-decent shout for a penalty turned down when he's 'obstructed' in the Chelsea box. 35 mins: Chelsea win a throw-in deep in Arsenal territory. Scott Parker wins a corner, which Damien Duff swings in. His delivery is poor, but Vieira only half clears. Eidur Gudjohnsen is teed up for a volley, but doesn't make decent contact. Chelsea win another corner and Arsenal clear. 38 mins: Scott Parker does his damnedest to keep a ball from going out for a throw-in, does so successfully and is promptly outraged when the linesman sticks his flag up anyway. I can see his point. 41 mins: John Terry and Wayne Bridge combine well to bamboozle Lauren and send Damien Duff down the left wing. Within seconds, there's another Arsenal defender over to shut him down. Apropos not a lot, I read in a newspaper recently that Damien Duff is a big fan of West End musicals. I wouldn't have had him pegged as a man who could regularly be found humming along to The Lion King. Whatever blows your hair back, I suppose. 44 mins: Edu goes down in a heap, despite not having been touched by Scott Parker's tackle. (Cue: Another flurry of emails from Heather Johnson.) \"Same old Arsenal! Boring! Cheating!\" sing the Chelsea throng. The referee blows for half-time. It's been tight. Very tight. But not as tight as a camel's rectum which - and I hope this is the last time I'll be exploring this camel comedy cul-de-sac, if you'll pardon the expression - flaps in the breeze, according to all you dromedary experts who've been mailing in your droves to make fun of my unfortunate turn of phrase. A lesser man than me would just delete it, but I'm comfortable with who I am. Lame insult dept: \"My grandmother can type faster than you!\" writes Richard Bartley. Of course she can, Dickie. She's a woman. She's could be somebody's PA, for all I know. Or a court stenographer. Honestly. 45 mins: The second half gets underway, and let's hope it's more aesthetically pleasing than the first. Graeme Souness gave good point during Sky's half-time analysis when he said that while it isn't pretty to watch, it's interesting because it's two teams of foreigners playing a European tie in the English style. Monaco lead Real Madrid 1-0 in the Bernabeu, incidentally, and are apparently giving them \"the run-around\". 47 mins: Marco Ambrosio wellies a kick-out up the field, Patrick Vieira heads it into the centre-circle and 18 different players scrap for a piece of the ball. That's been about the size of it for the whole match so far. Lampard hits a snap-shot from distance which takes a deflection and looks as if it sneaks in, but only hits the side-netting. Lehmann has a bit of a flap at the ensuing corner, but gathers eventually. 50 mins: Thierry Henry shoots from outside the box. It's not a pile-driver, but the crowd of players blocking Ambrosio's view, coupled with the bounce of the ball, makes the Italian 'keeper's job difficult. He saves well. 52 mins: Chelsea 1 - 0 Arsenal An excellent oppportunist goal from Eidur Gudjohnsen, who capitalises on a Jens Lehmann howler. The German goalkeeper had galloped out of his box to clear a long ball sent in behind the Arsenal defence. Gudjohnsen chased it down, skinned Sol Campbell for pace and blocked Lehmann's attempted clearance. The ball ran loose and the Chelsea striker did very well to steer the ball into an empty goal from wide on the left. An excellent goal. 56 mins: Arsenal are rattled, big time! Since scoring, Chelsea have had two half-chances with Eidur Gudjohnsen up to his neck in both of them. He narrowly failed to get his head to a Duff cross, and then saw a low cross of his own cut out by Toure when Duff and Mutu were unmarked and waiting to pounce on the edge of the Arsenal six-yard box. 58 mins: Chelsea 1 - 1 Arsenal I told you they were rattled. Ashley Cole sends in a delightful cross from the left, Robert Pires and John Terry jump together on the edge of the six-yard box and the Frenchman sends an unstoppable header past Marco Ambrosio in the Chelsea goal. Great stuff. 62 mins: Peter Baker is one of those strange oflk who watches on telly while reading this: \" I am watching the match on Ireland's Network 2 channel for free while I follow the banter on-line,\" he says. To my mind, that's like paying to see Lord Of The Rings and then reading the book as soon as the cinema projector starts rolling. How is top Network 2 commentator George \"Oh, danger here!\" Hamilton, by the way? Claude Makelele gets a yellow card for a handball which couldn't possibly have been deliberate. Free kick for Arsenal which Thierry Henry balloons over the bar from about 35 yards. 66 mins: Richard Bartley has mailed in to say that his granny who can type faster than me is not a court stenographer. She's dead. 69 mins: On the Chelsea bench, Joe Cole is stripping off and chewing gum in a suggestive manner. Either he's turned into a two-bit prostitute and is looking for business or he's coming on to the field. I'm guessing that he's going to replace Scott Parker, who's done nish all. 71 mins: Chelsea substitutions: Cole for Parker, Crespo for Mutu. Arsenal substitution: Gilberto for Bergkamp. 73 mins: \"I too am watching the match, on Danish television. Their commentators can't stop babbling about Jesper Gronkjaer and the upcoming royal wedding, but I would prefer to watch in silence while reading your play-by-play and the musings about sphincters in desert conditions contained therein,\" writes Christian Svanes Kolding, seemingly oblivious to the fact that I didn't mention sphincters at all. Kolo Toure cuts out another attempted cross from Duff and the Irishman spits on the ground in frustration. Careful now, Damien. Somebody's mother has to clean that up. 77 mins: Arsenal substitution: Jose Antonio Reyes for Freddie Ljungberg. Real Madrid are beating Monaco 3-1 in Spain. Chelsea go forward and Crespo attempts a shot from the edge of the box. It takes a defelction and goes out for a corner. Duff swings it in and Patrick Vieira heads clear. 79 mins: Gudjohnsen spurns a half-chance. A Duff cross was flicked on to the far post by Arsenal defender Sol Campbell, where Gudjohnsen was lurking inconspicuously (in so far as a tall, blond, Icelandic bloke with the physique of a giraffe can lurk inconspicuously). His volley was blocked by Pires. 82 mins: Marcel Desailly gets his second booking for a late tackle on Henry. His first booking was just a minute ago, when he knocked the ball out of Jens Lehmann's hand as the goalkeeper was attempting a throw-out. He walks off the field disconsolately and will miss the second leg. He didn't miss Henry's legs though, eh? 85 mins: Chelsea are in all sorts of bother at the moment. They haul off Eidur Gudjohnsen and send on Mario Melchiot to fill the Desailly-shaped hole in their defence. They win a corner, which Duff takes short. Arsenal clear. Why they're haven't been sending all those corners in towards Jens \"Flap\" Lehmann is anyone's guess. 89 mins: \"G'day, I'm curious to know whether the fact that being my being in New Zealand while reading updates at work, and therefore being much further away than many 'viewers', accounts for the short naps I am able to take in between your updates?\" enquires Joe Standen, who should probably check to see if the two sheep running in the wheel that powers his computer have been fed recently. What have you ever given the world, Joe, apart from petty criticisms, a middling rugby team and Xena Warrior Princess? Eh? Hernan Crespo attempts to kung-fu kick a Damien Duff cross into the Arsenal goal, but Lehmann saves. 90 mins+2 Peep! Peep! Peep! Senor Gonzalez blows for full-time and the teams traipse off. Arsenal have the advantage going into the second leg, with two easy matches against Manchester United to come in between. In the Bernabeu stadium, Real Madrid have punished Monaco's first-half insolence by putting four past them in the second 45 minutes. It's finished 4-2 to the home side in Spain. Last word goes to Jonathan Harwood, on that unfortunate camel business: \"Maybe Christian (73 mins) in Denmark means Sphinxes not sphincters,\" he surmises. \"You didn't mention them either but they exist in desert conditions. Like camels' ar*es.\" Thanks for that. Lovely.
