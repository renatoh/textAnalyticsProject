Although Ryan Giggs, United's interim manager, suggested Jones would recover in time, his comments are understood to have been optimistic. Jones suffered the problem in a first-half collision with Hull City's Maynor Figueroa in Tuesday evening's 3-1 win at Old Trafford. His shoulder is not dislocated as had been feared \u2013 he is thought to have bruised or strained ligaments \u2013 and Giggs said at United's pre-match press conference on Friday morning: \"Phil's injury isn't as bad as I thought on the night. He is obviously out for Sunday but should be all right for the World Cup.\" However Jones is by no means certain to recover in time for the tournament. Although Hodgson will wait until the last possible moment to make any decision, if Jones is not passed fit it will affect the make-up of his 23-man party for Brazil. The 22-year-old is viewed by England's manager as vital because of an ability to cover three positions: right-back, centre-back and defensive midfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
