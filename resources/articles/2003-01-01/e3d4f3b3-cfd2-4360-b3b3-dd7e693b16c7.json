Hayes, who presented LBC's morning phone in show for 14 years and returned to the station yesterday following new owner Chrysalis's relaunch, said it was still early days for the new breakfast show, but it needed to improve. \"The two presenters need to work out the best way to work as a team. Interrupting each other makes it difficult to understand what is being said,\" Hayes said in a MediaGuardian online chat today. \"And guests are often squandered. Getting someone to come into the studio and then allowing them a few words is not very useful,\" added Hayes, who began presenting a new weekly media show on LBC yesterday. \"Things will improve I am sure. It should aim to be the programme Londoners listen to and that will take time.\" Hayes began his radio broadcasting career in Australia in the 1950s and made his name in this country presenting his LBC phone-in show between 1976 and 1990. Talking about the state of the radio industry today, Hayes said \"shock jock\" presenters did not seem to have the same ability to argue an issue from both sides. \"In those LBC programmes back in the 70s and 80s, my policy was not to shock but to listen to opinions and then put an opposing view, whether I agreed with it or not,\" he added. Hayes also said he thought there was a gap in the radio market for station that played the old \"standards\" by the likes of Cole Porter, Gershwin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett. \"Radio 2 used to fulfil that role but they have redirected their music policy. Come to think of it, the corporation could have started a digital radio station playing that music I described,\" he added. Hayes also expressed fears over the possible consolidation of ownership in the radio sector. \"I don't think a radio industry that ends up being owned by just a couple of huge companies is likely to enrich the medium. After all, their interest is not radio, but profit,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
