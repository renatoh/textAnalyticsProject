While we offer up grateful thanks that Virgil did not get his way over The Aeneid (he asked that the manuscript be burned), or that Boswell's journals were not 'lost' after all (they were found in an ebony cabinet), these days you have to wonder why the executors of literary estates are so willing to leave their consciences - not to mention their brains - at the library door. Is there any true admirer of Philip Larkin who found the decision by his executors to publish Trouble at Willow Gables, the risqu\u00e9 schoolgirl fiction that he showed only to friends in his lifetime, wise or even remotely edifying? I think not, and all the semantic wriggling in the world - Faber took comfort in the fact that he had set his naughty novels in typescript - won't change that. In 2006, 120 unpublished poems and fragments by Elizabeth Bishop were collected in one volume, Edgar Allan Poe &amp; the Jukebox. Its editor, Alice Quinn, noted that this was a work that Bishop, a renowned perfectionist, had chosen not to destroy. But there is a gaping difference between failing to destroy something, and wanting it to be published, a gap that literary executors are supposed to respect, not exploit. I approached Towards Another Summer, then, somewhat cautiously, as if it might explode in my face. Janet Frame, New Zealand's greatest writer, died in 2004, and yet here is a new novel - or, rather, an old one that its author considered too personal to be published in her lifetime. At the back of Virago's edition (it appeared first in New Zealand in 2007) is a note by Frame's niece, Pamela Gordon, in which she thanks board members at the Janet Frame Literary Trust for 'sharing the responsibility for the decision to offer this manuscript for publication'. Gordon then falls back on the Larkin defence, noting that, though Frame left no instructions about Towards Another Summer, 'she bound two copies of the typescript and preserved them in separate locations ... we have concluded that she anticipated posthumous publication'. As if to set the seal on this verdict, the novel is presented as any new piece of fiction would be. It comes with no scholarly introduction setting it in the context of Frame's other work, and the year it was written - 1963 - is noted only on its jacket. The message in such a lack of information is clear. This work stands alone. It is to be judged on its own merits, not as some flimsy postscript to an otherwise magnificent career. This is a neat move by Frame's estate and publisher, but it does present certain challenges. Not even the most devoted of deconstructionists can ignore the fact that Frame's life is painfully and inextricably connected to her work; her eventual recognition as a writer came only after the publication of three volumes of autobiography late on in her career: To the Is-Land (1982), An Angel at My Table (1984) and The Envoy From Mirror City (1985), which were themselves written, at least in part, as a response to the wild rumours that circulated about her. As a young woman, Frame spent nearly a decade in mental hospitals; wrongly diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, she escaped a lobotomy only because shortly before it was scheduled to take place, she won a major literary prize. All her work is preoccupied with, among other things, the untraceable line between so-called sanity and insanity, with the confusing continuation into adulthood of what she once called 'the adolescent homelessness of the self'. So, it is useful, if not essential, to know what was going on in her world when she was writing, and perhaps doubly so in the case of a posthumous novel. Towards Another Summer was written when Frame was living in London, and is based on a weekend visit she made to the north, to the home of a journalist, his Kiwi wife and their children (the journalist was Geoffrey Moorhouse of the Guardian, who interviewed Frame in 1962). The weekend, evidently painful if this account of it is anything to go by, 'stuck in the gullet' of the novel she was working on at the time, The Adaptable Man, and she was compelled to deal with the blockage by getting it down on paper. Then she put it away. Why? Can this slim account of 48 hours in a draughty house really be more personal, more humiliating and raw than her descriptions of her time as a mental patient? Perhaps not. But it does have a visceral honesty all of its own. As an account of what it is like to be an overly sensitive and lonely single young woman, it is as true and as piercing as anything I have read in a very long time. Grace Cleave, excessively shy and odd-looking to boot - like Frame, she is followed by a cloud of untameably frizzy hair wherever she goes - has, against her better judgment, accepted Philip Thirkettle's invitation to stay for the weekend. As a result, she finds herself in the grip of an inability to communicate that is almost comic, given that she makes her (very poor) living as a writer. She cannot speak, not even if she rehearses the line - 'Yes, I do like cheese on toast' - in her head beforehand. So she finds herself a domestic fugitive, always trying to escape the curious glances of her hosts and the beady eyes of their children by fleeing to her bedroom, with its gas fire and its tray of seed potatoes. Downstairs, it is as though she is a character in a particularly dreary kind of play. The hours tick by. Grace's mood is not helped by her deepening conviction that she is a migratory bird - hence her longing to fly home to 'another summer' - nor by the home movie of her childhood that plays endlessly in her head. These memories combine with the unnerving proximity of the Thirkettles to reduce Grace to a state of numb helplessness. Philip and Anne become her parents, their children her siblings; the kitchen of the house in (the fictional) Winchley blurs with the one in Oamaru where she grew up. Her isolation is painfully complete. She feels every utterance - even the words 'yes' and 'no' - the way other people might feel a sharp punch to the stomach. Nothing happens, then - and yet, everything does. In this sense, the book is strongly reminiscent of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway (Frame is much more the daughter of Woolf than of Katherine Mansfield, the writer to whom she is most often compared). The novel is exciting for its language - it plays with poetry, magical realism and metaphor in genuinely daring ways - and for the way it embraces themes that will later be central to Frame's best work: the dichotomy between inner and outer worlds, between fantasy and reality, between innocence and experience. Grace longs for the sunshine of home - Frame's portrait of the grimy north of the Sixties is humorously grim - but light is always a mixed blessing: it is too revelatory. 'Grace gave a shudder. The day ahead seemed so long, so everlastingly, intolerably provided with light; there was nowhere to hide; even the grey northern light penetrating the kitchen was unmerciful in the way it marked the outline of every object bringing to the furniture and clothes a winter share of poverty and to the face of Anne and the children an incongruous mark of age and defeat.' It feels surprisingly right to hold Towards Another Summer, with its modest, non-attention seeking cover, in one's hands. It is a short novel, but a numinous one. This time, the keepers of the flame did the right thing. Janet Frame: life story Early life Born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1924, the third of five children. Frame's father was a railway engineer and her mother a maid. She went to teacher training college but had a breakdown. Later, British psychiatrists concluded she was never mentally ill. Selected publications Owls Do Cry (1957); The Rainbirds (1968); You Are Now Entering the Human Heart (1983); An Angel at My Table (1984); The Carpathians (1988). Awards 1983 CBE (services to literature); 1989 Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Literature; 1990 Member of the Order of New Zealand. She says: 'I inhabited a territory of loneliness which resembles the place where the dying spend their time before death, and from where those who do return to the world bring a unique point of view that is a nightmare, a treasure, and a lifelong possession.' They say: 'A poetic soul has rarely come better disguised.' Jane Campion"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
