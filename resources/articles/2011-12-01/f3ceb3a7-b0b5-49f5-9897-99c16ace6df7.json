Bookended by a tremendous opening sequence, and a strong finale, the film sags into near-nothingness. Michel Piccoli gives a sympathetic performance as a Cardinal Melville, who participates in a solemn Vatican conclave on the occasion of the Pope's death. Moretti creates a witty and persuasively detailed \"election\" sequence as the Cardinals cast their votes. The finger of destiny points to poor Melville, who succumbs to something between stage fright and an existential anxiety attack; moaning that he can't do it, he goes walkabout, incognito, on the streets of Rome. Moretti plays a psychotherapist brought in secretly to analyse the Pope: a nice Sopranoesque idea. Yet nothing is made of it. In fact, while Melville is awol, Moretti's shrink organises a volleyball tournament of the remaining cardinals: a very silly and boring waste of screen time. A wasted opportunity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
