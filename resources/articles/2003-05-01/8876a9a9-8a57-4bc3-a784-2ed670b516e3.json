CORUS OF DISAPPROVAL The Yorkshire Post made much of the decision by Corus to cut 355 jobs at its steelworks in Stocksbridge near Sheffield and illustrated the story with a poignant picture. The Rev Stephen Tricklebank stands by a notice which reads \"Please pray for the valley\". Mr Tricklebank, who had fixed the notice to a board outside the church of St Mathias close to the works, appears to be looking to heaven for guidance. Perhaps he fears the Stocksbridge workers may not get more help from there than from the company. Inside, the YP carried a full page of reports and reaction plus another picture of a worker playing the last post on a defiant bugle. The paper also fretted over the very uncertain future of the Corus plant at Redcar on Teesside where 2,900 jobs may be at risk. \"Corus announced that products made at the factory in Redcar would no longer be needed by the company and they would have to compete on the open market.\" In a leader headlined Corus Of Disapproval, the YP says: \"The cost of this corporate failure has been borne not by company executives, who are enjoying the benefits of a new bonus scheme, but by workers in South Yorkshire, Scunthorpe and Teesside, all of whom now face uncertain futures.\" The leader goes on to rebuke the government for its laissez-faire approach. \"Time is now running out if the firm is to diversify without causing long-term industrial damage in those areas where it has been the principle employer...It is not the skills of the workforce that have been found wanting but those of the management.\" REWRITING THE PLOT Liverpool this week came second to the Newcastle-Gateshead double act in a BBC poll on which city should be capital of culture in 2008. But the gap between the two cities is narrower than the wing of a gull gliding over the Mersey, and the deadly rivalry continues. There is a lot at stake here, with the final decision due in June. So the Liverpool Daily Post splashed on a bid to launch the Merseyside Film and TV Initiative with the help of a hoped-for GBP2.2m of Euro money and GBP4m of Objective One cash. \"As well as training local people to work in movie-making, the money will also be spent promoting Liverpool to the film industry,\" says the story. The news was greeted with joy in the Post's leader column. \"Set a story in Oxford or Cambridge and it will be bound to have an academic background; place it in Blackpool and it will be seaside fun and frolics. But base a plot in Merseyside and there is a rich seam of cultural influences which can lead the film-maker down any one of a number of avenues - and the viewer will know at once that anything can happen... Any story could be set here without fear of jeopardising the credibility of the plot.\" Not sure about South With Scott, even on a chilly day, at the Pier Head, or South Pacific in Bootle, but you get his/her drift. Liverpool, in short, wants to breed its own best boys and gaffers rather than give house room to a pack of here-today-gone-tomorrow technical types. Next week Newcastle-Gateshead will hit back with a remake of The Ten Commandments, with Robson Green as Noah parting the waters of the Tyne. SITUATION VACANT Here's a chance for a ham actor who can tell the difference between a cow and a sheep. According to the Westmoreland Gazette, the National Trust is looking for a Victorian farmer to add to the enjoyment of visitors to Townend, its lovely old farmhouse (with Jacobean fully-fitted kitchen) near Troutbeck. The new recruit will help Trevor Hinxman, who has proved a hit with his performance (in full 1900 agricultural clobber) as yeoman farmer George Browne. Volunteers, we are told, should have an interest in history and a little acting ability. LAST POST Still with the Gazette, the saddest story on its many broadsheet pages is that Beast Banks post office in Kendal is facing closure.This is the very same post office where Postman Pat (and his black and white cat) would collect his mail before heading up hill and down dale in his little red van. MANDELSON SAYS: 'I'M STILL HERE' The Hartlepool Mail made quite a bit of an interview its local MP had with Mirror editor Piers Morgan for the coming Tabloid Tales programme on BBC1. The paper was particularly interested in a section that will not be included in the finished programme. \"Peter Mandelson has hinted he is keen to return to front-line politics - and believes he is at the 'peak of his skills',\" says the Mail. \"He has twice been forced to resign from the political top table, when he was trade and industry secretary and Northern Ireland secretary. \"But Mr Mandelson said: 'I've been very, very busy and a very active MP. As far as I'm concerned, I never went away. I'm already here. So many people have helped sustain me during this period. 'As a result I have emerged happier, stronger, certainly different. I feel at the peak of my skills. When I left the government, people said \"You'll be leaving politics\". Well, I haven't.'\" Threat or promise? SPORT: ROONEY'S TIME WILL COME The Liverpool Daily Post has spent most of the week cheering up Everton's teenage wonder Wayne Rooney, who failed to be named as PFA young player of the year. The paper revealed that former Everton striker Duncan McKenzie (now grey-haired and sensibly overcoated according to the accompanying picture) has predicted that young Wayne, 17, could win the award for the next five years. But then he added a timely warning: is Everton good enough for its emerging superstar? \"What it comes down to is that Wayne will eventually want to play in the Champions League and Everton have to get there before he does,\" warned McKenzie. \"I'd be gobsmacked if there wasn't a massive bid for him in the next two years. \"I know the family are mad Evertonians and the theory is that they will be there for ever. Wayne's a massive Everton fan but you can point to Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler, Ian Rush and Steve McManaman. Every one of those has been rabid Evertonians as boys and ended up across the road.\" Do not ask what he means by \"across the road\". WE RECOMMEND... Spem in Alium, the motet in 40 parts by the Elizabethan composer Thomas Tallis, is one of the great masterpieces of the golden age of polyphony. It's a wonder to listen to but a nightmare to sing if you (a) cannot sight read very well and (b) cannot count. Artist Janet Cardiff has removed the singers and the strain in her piece installed at Tate Liverpool. Forty loudspeakers on tall, thin stands surround a plain bench. So settle down, sit still and listen. But try not to join in: it disturbs the other gallery-goers. Tate Liverpool HOT STUFF The Weekly news reports that the Bombay Banger has exploded into KwikSave stores on Merseyside. This variant on the traditional sausage is made from lamb and has been spiced up with a little curry. It is available in both madras and korma versions, according to taste. The banger is allegedly about to go nationwide, as the rest of Britain follows the culinary experiment in the north-west. \"The curry sausage is not intended to replace the real things but it's a nice alternative,\" said the man from KwikSave. \"It has every ingredient you would expect to find at your local curry house.\" Minus the offensive drunks, of course.
