The New York-based company, which celebrated its 275th anniversary this year, said it had accepted an offer from Drahi, a media and telecoms entrepreneur, that values it at 60% more than its closing share price on Wall Street last Friday. The deal will require approval from the company\u2019s shareholders and clearance from regulators but is otherwise expected to become effective in the fourth quarter of this year. \u201cI am honoured that the board of Sotheby\u2019s has decided to recommend my offer,\u201d said Drahi, a 55-year-old French-Israeli businessman who lives in Switzerland. \u201cSotheby\u2019s is one of the most elegant and aspirational brands in the world. As a longtime client and lifetime admirer of the company, I am acquiring Sotheby\u2019s together with my family.\u201d While rival Christie\u2019s occupies more of the top slots in tables of the largest art sales, Sotheby\u2019s has brought the hammer down on high-profile artworks and books, including a 710-year-old copy of the Magna Carta for $21.3m and Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream, which went for $120m in 2012. Drahi, who is worth an estimated $9.3bn, according to Forbes, made his fortune in the telecoms and media industries. He is the founder and majority shareholder of the Amsterdam-listed telecoms firm Altice, which he built via a string of acquisitions of smaller companies, including landmark deals in the US that led to the group\u2019s American assets being spun off into a separate company. The Sotheby\u2019s chief executive, Tad Smith, said the auction house\u2019s growth plans would be easier to achieve in a \u201cflexible private environment\u201d. Sotheby\u2019s has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1988 but its 275-year history predates the existence of the Wall Street exchange by nearly 50 years. The company was founded in London in 1744 by the bookseller Samuel Baker, as a dealer in rare books. His first auction involved the sale of \u201cseveral hundred scarce and valuable books in all branches of polite literature\u201d from the library of Sir John Stanley, fetching \u00a3826. The business did not enter the world of fine arts until the early 20th century, moving to New York in 1965 as the US market became increasingly important. As well as auctions of art and books, it has expanded into areas including wine, diamonds and also a financial services arm that funds art deals and makes loans secured against collections."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
