Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Gazans returned to their properties Tuesday as a ceasefire with Israel held. Many encountered scenes of destruction. Bodies were identified, possessions were claimed and residents sought sources of water, food and other necessities. Fishermen re-entered the water and children went swimming. UNICEF estimated that 373,000 children have had some kind of direct traumatic experience and require immediate psycho-social support. As of 9pm local time Tuesday, the health ministry put the death toll in Gaza at 1,875, including 430 children. The UN appealed for emergency aid for Gaza, saying it needed $188m to provide for 250,000 displaced people for an estimated eight weeks. Total reconstruction costs were estimated in the billions. Diplomats from all sides arrived in Cairo for peace talks. Palestinian delegates said they did not hold direct talks with their Egyptian and Israeli counterparts Tuesday. The Israeli army withdrew from Gaza. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers, two Israeli civilians and a Thai national were killed in the conflict. A New Delhi TV crew filmed what appeared to be militants assembling and firing a rocket, before the ceasefire, next to the Gaza hotel where the journalists were staying. Palestinian officials in the Hague met with the International Criminal Court, which they said they planned to join to bring war crimes charges against Israel. Tory peer Lady Warsi resigned from the British government, calling its policy in Gaza \u201cmorally indefensible.\u201d It\u2019s unclear who from the American side will attend the Gaza talks. Last time around the secretary of state\u2019s performance was met with stiff criticism from the Israeli and Egyptian sides. The AP zeroes in on the tunnel in east Rafah said to have been used in the attack last Friday that killed two or three Israeli soldiers (the circumstances of the death of Hadar 2nd lieutenant Hadar Goldin are unclear) and broke up the ceasefire. Here\u2019s the top of the AP report: Asmahan Ismail Abu al-Rous started wondering a year ago about the cause of the cracks on the walls of her Gaza home. When she asked some of her more savvy neighbors, they told her: Militants were digging an attack tunnel not far away. \u201cI did not think much about it then. I thought that was the resistance\u2019s business, not mine,\u201d the widowed mother of four said Tuesday, standing amid the ruins of her two-story home in the Shawkah district, an eastern section of Rafah near Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt. Barely 50 meters (yards) away, according to villagers, is an entrance of the tunnel where Hamas fighters emerged Friday to attack Israeli soldiers. Two Israelis were killed and a third was initially believed to be captured by the militants. That attack drew what was by far the heaviest Israeli shelling in the Gaza war, killing nearly 100 people that day alone and instantly unraveling a cease-fire shortly after it came into force. A day later, Israel determined the missing soldier, a 23-year-old infantry lieutenant, had been killed in the initial attack. On Tuesday, when a new 72-hour truce took hold, residents returned for the first time to see the extent of the destruction the worst in a single district anywhere in the Gaza Strip in four weeks of fighting. Read the full report here. A long Israeli security cabinet meeting on the ceasefire has ended, Haaretz reports: BBC and New York Times correspondents report that some family members of four Gazan boys who died on 16 July running for their lives on a beach away from Israeli shells say they now support Hamas: Reuters described the boys\u2019 death: Israeli shelling killed four Palestinian boys on a Gaza beach, an incident the military called tragic... Ahmed Abu Hassera, who witnessed the incident at the shore, told Reuters: \u201cThe kids were playing on the beach. They were all ... under the age of 15.\u201d \u201cWhen the first shell hit land, they ran away but another shell hit them all,\u201d said Abu Hassera, whose shirt was stained with blood. \u201cIt looked as if the shells were chasing them.\u201d New York Times photographer Tyler Hicks also witnessed the event: You can go for weeks or longer of seeing horrible scenes everyday, but there will be one that really stays with you. In this case it was when four young boys were killed on the beach. I was in my room in a modest hotel in Gaza City when I heard a loud explosion near the window. I looked outside and saw terrified children running away from the explosion. Just as I was grabbing my protective clothing and helmet, a second explosion came again. I could see that the very children I had seen running away from that initial explosion were now dead on the beach. To see young boys running for their lives and then a moment later they\u2019re dead is something I will never forget. It\u2019s unclear who from the United States will participate in the Cairo talks, AP reports: As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Gazans made their way back to their homes or former homes Tuesday as a ceasefire took hold. The UN appealed for emergency aid for survivors of the Gaza war. UNICEF warned that children in Gaza face deep peril in coming weeks and months. \u201cHow can a society cope with this?\u201d said a UN official. \u201cThis is a deep, deep, deep wound.\u201d Palestinian delegates in Cairo for truce talks said they had not yet held direct negotiations with their Egyptian or Israeli counterparts. The declared term of the current ceasefire, which began at 8am local time, is 72 hours. The Israeli military withdrew from Gaza. The IDF said it would respond to further attacks. It said 3,356 rockets had been fired from Gaza during the conflict, in which 64 soldiers, two Israeli civilians and a Thai national died. According to updated Gaza health ministry figures, 1,875 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, including 430 children. A France 24 crew has shot video of a purported rocket launcher in Gaza, after one of the station\u2019s correspondents was caught by surprise on air by the launch of a rocket. See earlier: NDTV crew films assembly of missile launch site and firing of missile in Gaza. Palestinian political leaders are poised to join the International Criminal Court (ICC) with the aim of putting Israel in the dock on war crimes charges, officials said today. The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger (@julianborger) and Ian Black (@ian_black) report: \u201cIsrael has left us with no other option,\u201d Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, told reporters after meeting ICC officials in The Hague to discuss the implications of signing the Rome Statute. It would make the Palestinian state a member of the court with the authority to call for an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Palestinian Authority has asked Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) to sign the accession document before it is formally presented, and officials say they now expect both organisations to agree. Read the full piece here. Last week the Associated Press reported on how war crimes charges could be a double-edged sword for the Palestinian factions: In trying to make a case against Israel, Abbas could also expose Hamas, a bitter rival turned potential political partner, to war crimes prosecution because it has fired thousands of rockets from Gaza at Israeli communities over the years. \u201cThis option is a double-edged sword,\u201d Abbas\u2019 Fatah movement wrote on its official Facebook page Thursday, saying he would only move ahead once he has the approval of Hamas. Former Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Paul Hirschson tweets news of the arrest three weeks ago of a Hamas leader in the June kidnapping of Israeli teens Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaer and Eyal Yifrah. An assertion of Hamas involvement in the kidnapping was used as pretext to arrest hundreds of Palestinians. But Israeli police and officials subsequently said that Hamas was not involved in the kidnapping. A week ago, Buzzfeed\u2019s Sheera Frankel wrote a piece headlined \u201cIsraeli Intelligence Officers Doubt Hamas Involvement In Incident That Sparked Gaza War.\u201d More to come. Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu failed to set any diplomatic goals for the Gaza war, \u201cnot even the most minimal ones,\u201d writes Haaretz diplomatic correspondent Barak Ravid: As in the past, Netanyahu returned the political passivity that he excels at, which accompanied the war from day one. Netanyahu went with the flow or was dragged along, waiting for someone else -- Egypt, the United States or the UN secretary-general \u2013 to come up political solutions and pull the chestnuts out of the fire. For an entire month a war was conducted in Gaza without the prime minister and members of the security cabinet holding a single discussion on how Israel would want its relationship with Gaza to look once it was over. The result is that after thousands of rockets fell on half of the country, an unprecedented shutdown of Ben-Gurion Airport, serious economic, diplomatic, and public-relations damage, and a heavy toll of more than 60 soldiers and civilians killed, Israel is exactly where it was before. Read the full piece here. There have been no negotiations in Egypt today between Palestinian delegates and their Egyptian and Israeli counterparts, according to one of the Palestinian negotiators, after the delayed arrival of new Palestinian negotiators in Cairo, the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Kingsley (@patrickkingsley) reports: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new\u2013today it looks like there was an Israeli delegation in Cairo but there are no direct negotiations,\u201d said Ziad al-Nakhala, deputy secretary-general of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a Gaza-based Hamas ally, who is in Cairo for the talks. \u201cI\u2019m expecting that there will [first] be talks between Cairo and Israel and after that the opinions will be clear.\u201d The Palestinian Authority\u2019s ambassador to Cairo, Gamal Shobky, confirmed Nakhala\u2019s account: \u201cUntil now, the Egyptian side has been negotiating with the Israeli side. Today, there are no negotiations between the Palestinians and the Egyptians. We wait for the discussions between Egyptians and the Israelis about the demands that we gave the Egyptians.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke (@burke_jason) tells the story of Hanan al-Qaq, 42, a teacher in Gaza who had two children wounded when her family first tried to return to their home in the southern city of Rafah on Friday: More than 9,000 Palestinians have been injured. Two of Qaq\u2019s seven children are among them. Her son Mohammed, 20, is in a critical condition after being hit in the chest and stomach by shell fragments when the family first tried to return to their home in the southern city of Rafah on Friday. \u201cWe started running, all of us,\u201d Qaq said. \u201cShells were falling. My little girl was hit. Her sister carried her. Then my son. I was shaking so much I could not pick him up. Some neighbours and my husband got him to hospital.\u201d Hussein al-Qaq, 47, is a garrulous civil servant, employed in the agriculture ministry. The family has lived in their breeze-block house, with its cats, and single vine, and corrugated iron fence for 20 years. Even in peacetime life is not easy. After paying for further education for his older children, there is little left and crippling bank loans are needed to tide over tight times. \u201cWe get by, just about,\u201d Qaq said.

From a Gaza shelter near Beit Lahiya and an Israeli shelter in Ashkelon, Reuters\u2019 Nidal al-Mughrabi and Maayan Lubell tell \u201cA tale of two shelters: Israelis and Palestinians united in fear.\u201d \u201cA life of humiliation - this how we live,\u201d said Ramadan Subuh, 42. At al-Fakhoura, as many as 50 people fill each classroom, and families use blankets to screen off their cramped quarters from others. Women use plastic buckets to bathe their children and wash dishes. \u201cYou have to wait 30 to 60 minutes to get into the bathroom. You have to wait your turn to drink and ... to get your lousy meal,\u201d said Subuh, a former farmhand who used to work in Israel before Hamas Islamists seized power in Gaza in 2007. In Ashkelon, Shir Elkayam, 22, has been living in the shelter with her partner and baby daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s been rough. It can drive you crazy. Kids can\u2019t be cooped up inside 24 hours a day for a month,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the lulls in the fighting, we let ourselves take them out for a bit to a movie or some other place that was safe.\u201d Read the full piece here. Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts photographs an If Not Now peace protest: More than 400 children have been killed in Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, and almost a thousand times as many are traumatised and face an \u201cextraordinarily bleak\u201d future, the top UNICEF official in Gaza said on Tuesday, according to Reuters: Pernille Ironside, head of the field office run by the U.N. children\u2019s agency in Gaza, said rebuilding children\u2019s lives would be part of a much larger effort to reconstruct the Palestinian enclave once the fighting has stopped for good. \u201cHow do we expect parents and caregivers to care for their children and to raise them in a positive and nurturing way when they themselves are barely functioning as humans? People have lost entire strands of their family in one blow. \u201cHow can a society cope with this? This is a deep, deep, deep wound,\u201d she said by phone, addressing a U.N news conference in Geneva. By Aug. 4, 408 Palestinian children were reported to have been killed, 31 percent of all civilian casualties, Reuters reports, and more than 70 percent of the 251 boys and 157 girls killed were 12 or younger. UNICEF estimates about 373,000 children have had some kind of direct traumatic experience and require immediate psycho-social support, Ironside said: Humanitarian workers were at their limit, she said, citing Israel\u2019s destruction of electric power supplies that had exacerbated an already parlous water supply situation by putting water pumping facilities out of action. \u201cThere\u2019s only very limited amount of water available. It\u2019s used for drinking, which means there\u2019s insufficient water for hygiene. We see children coming out of these shelters with scabies, lice, all kinds of communciable diseases. \u201cEven worse is that in the communities outside of the shelters, most people have not had any access to water through the system for several weeks now. They are in a terrible state in terms of being able to accees any kind of clean drinking water that\u2019s not contaminated by sewage.\u201d That could lead to diarrhoea and the further deaths of children, particularly under-fives, she said. The Israeli military and others have questioned why media outlets have not captured more documentation of Hamas activity in Gaza \u2013 exceptions such as this video of men apparently setting up a rocket launch notwithstanding. A search for Hamas-related images from wire services does not yield current images of fighters. Update: more on the question from war photographer Tyler Hicks on the New York Times Lens blog: This is a war fought largely behind the scenes. Hamas fighters are not able to expose themselves. If they were to even step a foot on the street they would be spotted by an Israeli drone and immediately blown up. We don\u2019t see those fighters. They are operating out of buildings and homes and at night. They are moving around very carefully. You don\u2019t see any signs of authority on the streets. If you can imagine every police officer, every person of authority in America gone, this is what that would look like. If we had access to them, we would be photographing them. I never saw a single device for launching the rockets to Israel. It\u2019s as if they don\u2019t exist. Read the full piece here. (h/t: @alanyuhas) More negotiators from Hamas and their Gazan allies, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, have arrived in Egypt this evening to start formal negotiations to end the Gaza crisis, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ambassador to Cairo, Gamal Shobky, tells the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Kingsley (@patrickkingsley). Patrick reports: Talks earlier in the day, Shobky said, were between Egyptian and Israeli delegates. \u201cUntil now, the Egyptian side has been negotiating with the Israeli side. Today, there are no negotiations between the Palestinians and the Egyptians. We wait for the discussions between Egyptians and the Israelis about the demands that we gave the Egyptians.\u201d As an aside, by agreeing to these negotiations, Hamas have made something of an about-turn: these negotiations are taking place without pre-conditions \u2013 something Hamas always maintained they wouldn\u2019t agree to. Previously they rejected any ceasefire that didn\u2019t spell out in advance how the siege of Gaza would be lifted. Journalist Bel Trew has visited Beit Hanoun, where she explored what was an IDF command centre in a boys\u2019 school. Trew\u2019s coverage also includes (Warning: graphic images) reports from a makeshift morgue in Rafah, where families are going to identify bodies, and from the Shifa hospital burn unit, where wounded civilians are fighting for their lives. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency has issued a flash appeal for assistance in meeting the emergency needs of Gazans. Based on these developments, UNRWA now requires a total of US$ 187,600,000 in order to provide emergency assistance for a revised scenario of up to 250,000 people being displaced during a period of up to eight weeks,\u201d the agency said in a statement: A portion of this funding will also be needed to start early recovery activities including shelter and installation repair upon cessation of hostilities. The increase in funding required for these activities (US$ 72.6 million on the previous total) is based on the rising number of those internally displaced and an extension of the period of assistance provision. Throughout this period, and until a cessation in hostilities is reached, UNRWA will continue to provide food, non-food items (NFIs) and psycho-social support at designated emergency shelters. The Agency will also continue to provide assistance to those seeking refuge outside of UNRWA operated shelters through the distribution of NFIs, provision of conditional cash assistance, and through ensuring that primary health centres and essential water utilities remain operational. Financial support to this appeal is essential for UNRWA to continue the provision of emergency assistance to the hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced by the hostilities. UNRWA maintains that the recurring conflict in Gaza can only be addressed by a political resolution. UNRWA breaks down its emergency response efforts into these categories: Food in Designated Emergency Shelter (DES), Non Food Items (NFIs), Shelter Repair, Conditional Cash Assistance, Health, Psycho-Social Support (PSS), Cash-for-Work, Environmental Health (WASH), and UNRWA Installation Repair. Read the full appeal here. Israeli troops returning from Gaza Tuesday morning \u201chugged and grinned, slapping each others\u2019 backs, relieved perhaps to have survived the war,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s Harriet Sherwood reports: Apart from the distant buzz of overhead drones, there was quiet \u2013 for the first time in weeks, there were no shells, rockets or sirens. Under the shade of a tree, a group of combat soldiers played backgammon or dozed in the searing August heat. One, who declined to give his name in line with army orders not speak to the media, had been fighting inside Gaza; it was, he said, \u201chot, smelly, full of bugs. And sometimes scary.\u201d He added: \u201cPart of me is glad it\u2019s over; I want to go home and see my parents. But another part of me thinks we should have stayed longer, because Hamas still rules Gaza. They\u2019ve been damaged and weakened, but they\u2019re still there. And Hamas is like a weed, you need to kill the roots or it will grow again.\u201d Read the full piece here. The spokesman for the UN Relief and Works Agency says the agency has provided mental health care to tens of thousands of Gazans, upon the ceasefire announcement: The Israeli tourism minister is optimistic about the ceasefire holding, predicting that tourism to Israel \u201cwill be back on track in the next three, four months\u201d. Tourism Minister Uzi Landau said the tourist industry had been on course for 4-4.1 million visitors in all this year, Reuters reports, but the Gaza war... ...caused a 35 percent plunge in visitors at a cost of $500 million in lost revenue for the third quarter, according to an Israel Hotel Association (IHA) estimate. That loss was \u201cfar too much\u201d for a country that relies on tourism for as much as 6 percent of its GDP , Landau told Reuters in an interview. \u201cThis year we would have had 4 to 4.1 million. It won\u2019t get there. It is not going to be a great year, another record year, as we had hoped, but we still hope for a good year. We hope to have at least the figure of last year. We believe things will be back on track in the next three, four months,\u201d he said. Obtaining water in Khan Yunis: (h/t: @alanyuhas) As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Gazans began to take the measure of destruction after a ceasefire appeared to take hold Tuesday morning, after 27 days of fighting. Entire neighborhoods have been razed in parts of Gaza, where in other areas that saw intensive bombardment, such as east Rafah, some residents were able to return home. There was no water or electricity. The Gaza health ministry said 1,865 people died in the conflict. Before-and-after satellite images of Gaza are here. The Israeli military said it had withdrawn from Gaza. Peace talks in Cairo may not begin until tomorrow. According to the terms of the 72-hour ceasefire, representatives of all parties are to hold formal talks. The scene in Shuja\u2019iya after a month of bombardment is captured in this BBC video report, which follows a mother of four children as she returns to her destroyed home: The Gaza health ministry said late on Monday that 1,865 people have been killed in the conflict and 9,563 wounded. Of these, 429 children were killed and 2,877 were wounded. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers were killed, the army said. Two civilians and one Thai national were killed in rocket attacks on Israel, it said. A Delhi TV crew has filmed what appears to be possible Hamas militants assembling and firing a rocket next to the Gaza hotel where the journalists were staying. The video was posted on the NDTV site within the last two hours. In the video, correspondent Sreenivasan Jain stands on a hotel balcony on Monday and narrates the action below. He says a mysterious tent has gone up next to the hotel. Two, and then three men are seen working in the tent. Later they take the tent down, covering their work with brush. At the end of the video, the camera captures what appears to be a missile launch. Jain and his crew attempt to visit the area of the launch but turn back upon warnings that a retaliatory strike may be imminent. Jain says the outlet waited to post the video until the crew had left Gaza. Watch the video here. Update: now on YouTube: (h/t: @jeffreygoldberg) \u201cI\u2019ve just driven to Rafah and back from Gaza City,\u201d writes the Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke (@burke_jason). \u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount of traffic on the road, even a couple of jams at places.\u201d Jason describes the scene in east Rafah, where some people are returning to their homes or former homes. \u201cEveryone is very nervous,\u201d he writes: Towards Rafah, the road has been cut by a massive air strike \u2013 and then what looks like the work of military bulldozers. The east of Rafah has been hit heavily in recent days, as it was the centre of the most recent fighting and was exempted from the ceasefire yesterday. There are some people returning to their homes. The damage I saw over an hour or so there isn\u2019t as bad as in some parts of Gaza, where entire neighbourhoods have basically been razed, but a lot of people have lost their homes or are going to have to spend a lot of time and energy putting them back together. Of course there\u2019s no power and no water either. And after the experience of the last ceasefire, broken after three hours, everyone is very nervous. The slightest bang and everyone starts running. Given that many have lost relatives and been under constant shellfire themselves for days or even weeks, that\u2019s pretty understandable. Back in Gaza - now seven hours into the ceasefire - the atmosphere is more relaxed, with shops that were shut yesterday now open and doing good business. Fishermen too tentatively putting out, though keeping only a few hundred metres offshore. But this ceasefire feels much more solid than last Friday\u2019s. Peter Maurer is president of the International Committee of the Red Cross: Here\u2019s a roundup of key events so far today: \u2022A 72-hour ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is under way in Gaza. The Israeli military said this morning that it had withdrawn from the Palestinian territory, as Israeli radio stations reported that ground forces had completed their mission of destroying cross-border tunnels. \u2022 Formal peace talk are likely to begin tomorrow in Cairo. Badr Abdelatty, Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, said it was waiting for \u201cthe high-level delegations\u201d to arrive. \u2022Palestinian foreign minister, Riad al-Malki, will today visit the international criminal court in the Netherlands to push for a war crimes case against Israel. Malki asked the United Nations last month to end what he called Israel\u2019s impunity and said it \u201cmust be held accountable for its crimes\u201d. \u2022Tory peer Lady Warsi has resigned from the British government. Warsi stood down in protest at policy on Gaza, which she called \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d. Downing Street said the prime minister \u201cregrets\u201d that she decided to stand down while the chancellor, George Osborne, described her decision as \u201cunnecessary\u201d. Reuters are reporting that the Palestinian foreign minister, Riad al-Malki, will today visit the international criminal court in the Netherlands to push for a war crimes case against Israel. The visit takes place shortly after Israeli and the Islamist Hamas movement entered a 72-hour truce mediated by Egypt in an effort to pave the way for an extended ceasefire. Israel and the Palestinians have traded allegations of war crimes during the Gaza assault, while defending their own actions as consistent with the international law. Malki asked the United Nations last month to end what he called Israel\u2019s impunity and said it \u201cmust be held accountable for its crimes.\u201d Last week, the United Nations launched an inquiry into human rights violations and crimes alleged to have been committed by Israel during the offensive, amid a far higher civilian death toll on the Palestinian side. The ICC, created more than a decade ago to prosecute individuals for war crimes, is a court of last resort, meaning that it will only intervene when a country is found to be unwilling or unable to carry out its own investigation. Israel is not a member of the ICC and the court therefore has no jurisdiction to investigate. Jurisdiction could be granted in a UN Security Council resolution, but Israel\u2019s ally the United States would have the power to block any such proposal. Gaza officials say 1,834 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in the war. Israel has countered that almost half those killed have been militants. Israel says 64 of its soldiers and three civilians have been killed since fighting began on July 8, after a surge in Palestinian rocket launches. Amnesty International on Monday appealed to the United States to halt transfers of fuel shipments to the Israeli military. It said there was mounting evidence of war crimes from both Israel and the Palestinians, adding that an ICC investigation was crucial in stopping the cycle of violations. In the Netherlands, Malki is due to visit the ICC in the morning, the Palestinian delegation in The Hague said. He will later meet with Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans and give a news conference. Chancellor George Osborne has hit back at criticism by Lady Warsi, who resigned from the cabinet this morning. He said her decision was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and insisted that ministers were committed to working to secure peace in the Middle East. He said: This a disappointing and frankly unnecessary decision. The British government is working with others in the world to bring peace to Gaza and we do now have a tentative ceasefire which we all hope will hold. My colleague Harriet Sherwood is on the Israel-Gaza border and has sent this dispatch: I\u2019m at the Israel-Gaza border, where the mood is noticeably more relaxed than in recent days. All troops have pulled out of Gaza and \u2013 aside from the incessant buzz of overhead drones \u2013 the air is quiet. No rockets, no sirens, no shelling, no Iron Dome. A group of soldiers lying in the shade said they were looking forward to going home and seeing their families. Everyone seems to think that this time it\u2019s for real, the conflict is over. But there is also reflection on the terrible cost of the war, and a fear that the cycle could begin again. Yossi Kuperwasser, Israel\u2019s minister for strategic affairs, this morning told reporters that Hamas had suffered big losses in the conflict. \u201cThey have lost their tunnels, thousands of rockets and hundreds of operatives. Every day that went by, they lost more, so I hope the lessons have been learned.\u201d He said what Israel wanted from negotiations was the demilitarisation of Gaza. \u201cWe have to remember that Hamas has not changed its ideology, it still wants to kill all Jews.\u201d Israel wanted to make certain that it did not have the tools to do that, he said. \u201cIf we get that, we\u2019re prepared to allow the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza.\u201d However the international community would have to ensure that materials, such as cement, were not diverted to rebuild tunnels. The ceasefire in Gaza so far seems to be holding, with no reports of air strikes or rocket attacks. Some refugees are making their way back to their homes. Many are returning to rubble. More from my colleague Patrick Kingsley in Cairo, who says formal peace talks between Hamas and Israel may not start until tomorrow. He explains: According to the terms of this new ceasefire, senior representatives of all concerned parties will come to Cairo for formal talks. But these haven\u2019t yet begun \u2013 and may not until tomorrow. \u201cWe are waiting for the high-level delegations to come to Cairo to start negotiations,\u201d said Badr Abdelatty, Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman. Downing Street has reacted to Lady Warsi\u2019s resignation this morning. A spokesman said: The PM regrets that Baroness Warsi has decided to stand down and is grateful for the excellent work that she has done both as a minister and in opposition. Our policy has always been consistently clear - the situation in Gaza is intolerable and we\u2019ve urged both sides to agree to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, said most \u201creasonably minded people across Britain will agree with the sentiments expressed\u201d by Warsi. It is a sad reflection of the prime minister\u2019s misjudgement of the crisis in Gaza that this capable minister has felt the need to leave the government. Here is a map with some key figures from Gaza, where, according to figures from the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 1,717 people have been killed and 485,000 displaced. Lady Warsi has also tweeted her resignation letter: In it she says: [The government\u2019s policy] is morally indefensible, is not in Britain\u2019s national interest and will have a long term effect on our reputation internationally and domestically. She adds that the decision \u201chas not been easy\u201d but there is \u201cgreat unease\u201d within the Foreign Office over \u201cthe way recent decisions are being made\u201d. I must be able to live with myself for the decisions I took or the decisions I supported. By staying in government at this time I do not feel that I can be sure of that. The Huffington Post has an interview with Lady Warsi In it she says: The British government can only play a constructive role in solving the Middle East crisis if it is an honest broker and at the moment I do not think it is. She adds that one of the reasons she resigned, despite the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, was because she wanted to see alleged war crimes, in both Gaza and Israel, investigated and did not believe the British government would support that process. As the minister for the international criminal court, I\u2019ve spent the last two and a half years helping to promote, support and fund the ICC. I felt I could not reconcile this with our continued pressure on the Palestinian leadership not to turn to the ICC to seek justice. Warsi admitted she had been struggling with the coalition\u2019s stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict since November 2012. Our position not to recognise Palestinian statehood at the UN in November 2012 placed us on the wrong side of history and is something I deeply regret not speaking out against at the time. It appalls me that the British government continues to allow the sale of weapons to a country, Israel, that has killed almost 2,000 people, including hundreds of kids, in the past four weeks alone. The arms exports to Israel must stop. Warsi said she was a \u201clong-standing supporter of Conservative Friends of Israel, and someone who fundamentally believes in Israel\u2019s right to to exist and be secure\u201d but \u201ccouldn\u2019t sit silently by as the Israeli military committed acts that have been described by [UN secretary general] Ban Ki-moon as \u2018moral outrages\u2019 and \u2018criminal acts\u2019 and by the French foreign minister as \u2018massacres\u2019\u201d. The peer said she was left frustrated by the UK\u2019s reluctance to strongly condemn the killing of civilians in Gaza. The UN is \u2018morally outraged\u2019, the US government has called the shelling of schools \u2018totally indefensible\u2019. Meanwhile, the British government has been dragging it heels. The former senior Foreign Office minister said she was not defending Hamas attacks on Israel. Hamas is a terrorist organisation and there can never be any excuse for it to fire rockets targeting civilians in Israel. It too must be held accountable for the misery it inflicts upon both the Israelis and the Palestinians [...] Israel as an occupying power has a responsibility of course to protect Israelis but it also has a responsibility to protect Palestinians. The Press Association are reporting that in her resignation letter Warsi said: [the Government\u2019s] approach and language during the current crisis in Gaza is morally indefensible, is not in Britain\u2019s national interest and will have a long term detrimental impact on our reputation internationally and domestically. My colleague Patrick Wintour has this report on Lady Warsi\u2019s resignation. here are some extracts: Lady Warsi, the senior Foreign Office minister, has resigned from the government in protest at its policy on Gaza, a decision that Downing Street says it is checking. Warsi said on her Twitter account on Tuesday: \u201cWith deep regret I have this morning written to the prime minister and tendered my resignation. I can no longer support government policy on Gaza\u201d. She has been known to be unhappy at the failure of the prime minister to unequivocally condemn Israel\u2019s incursion into Gaza or the death toll. On Monday, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to say if Israel was behaving disproportionately or doing enough to prevent civilian casualties. [...] Cameron is due to fly to Portugal on Tuesday morning to rejoin his family on holiday after attending the first world war commemorations in France and Belgium. [...] There was a high-level campaign to remove Warsi from the government in last month\u2019s reshuffle, particularly after she appeared on ITV\u2019s The Agenda and posed with a mock front page about the \u201cEton Mess\u201d at the top of the government. Warsi is known to be keeping a diary and there have been fears she will publish it before the election in an effort to reveal the upper-class coterie in Cameron\u2019s inner circle. She was removed as Conservative party co-chair and then, in a battle with No 10, was given the title of senior foreign office minister. Her opponents will claim her resignation on a matter of principle is a cynical act, but her supporters will say Cameron\u2019s position on Israel has been over-supportive, repeatedly blaming Hamas for the conflict and the breakdown of successive ceasefires. Ironically, Warsi\u2019s decision to quit comes as a three-day ceasefire has been agreed, and both sides are set to enter talks in Cairo. On LBC radio Boris Johnson has said he has the \u201cgreatest respect\u201d for Warsi. He added that she had \u201cdone a great job\u201d and hoped she \u201cwould be back soon\u201d. Asked for his own opinion of the situation in Gaza, he said: What is happening in Gaza is utterly horrifying and unacceptable. [But] there is no point on us getting into a bidding war about who can issue most frenzied denunciation of what is going on. Others have commented on Warsi\u2019s resignation. The BBC have some more background on Lady Warsi : Lady Warsi, who was previously chairman of the Conservative Party, became the first female Muslim cabinet minister when David Cameron took office in 2010. She grew up in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, and worked as a solicitor before entering politics. Lady Warsi was demoted from the cabinet to a middle-ranking Foreign Office post in 2012. She was made minister for faith and communities at the same time. One of five daughters of Pakistani immigrants, Lady Warsi studied at Leeds University, later working for the Crown Prosecution Service before setting up her own legal practice. Lady Warsi has previously used Twitter to call for greater international efforts to end the crisis in Gaza. Boris Johnson was on LBC this morning when the news came of Lady Warsi\u2019s resignation. He said \u201cit was a bit strong\u201d for Warsi to resign over this issue. The news will come as a major blow for David Cameron. Warsi, the first Muslim to serve in a British cabinet, is a high-profile figure in the Conservative party, a former party co-chair, a life peer and minister for faith and communities. Lady Warsi has resigned from her post as a senior foreign office minister over the government\u2019s stance on Gaza. Israel\u2019s oldest daily newspaper Haaretz has called for an investigation into the army\u2019s actions following the suspected kidnapping of Hadar Goldin. Goldin was declared dead in action on Sunday. The paper states: Israel has a moral obligation to investigate precisely what happened in Rafah \u2014 and this is regardless of any international demand to probe the allegations of war crimes. It must be ascertained whether the IDF chief of staff and the political echelon were aware in real time of the heavy fire directed at residential neighborhoods and its tragic consequences, as well as the intensity of the attacks on Rafah even after Goldin\u2019s death was confirmed. Hamas statement on the ceasefire. Bassam Salhi, a member of the Palestinian delegation, said: It\u2019s clear now that the interest of all parties is to have a ceasefire. It\u2019s going to be tough negotiations because Israel has demands too. We don\u2019t have any guarantees the siege will be removed. Ziad al-Nakhala, deputy secretary general of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, has told the Guardian that he believed a deal would be reached. Israel\u2019s statement on the ceasefire: The Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told the Associated Press: At 8am local time \u2026 a ceasefire starts and Israel will cease all military operations against terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip. Israel will honour the ceasefire and will be watching to see if Hamas does too. My colleague Jason Burke is in Gaza, where he says an uneasy truce is holding for the moment. A 72-hour ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has begun in Gaza. The Israeli military said this morning that it had withdrawn from the Palestinian territory, as Israeli radio stations reported that ground forces had completed their mission of destroying cross-border tunnels. The ceasefire began at 8am local time. Palestinian representatives have been in Cairo since Sunday discussing a set of demands and a possible end to hostilities. Israel confirmed that it would be sending a delegation to Cairo for peacekeeping talks on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
