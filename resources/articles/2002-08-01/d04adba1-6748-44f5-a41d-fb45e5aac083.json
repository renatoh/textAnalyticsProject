Shafiq Rasul and Asif Iqbal, both from Tipton in the West Midlands, and David Hicks, from Adelaide, have been imprisoned at the US naval base in Cuba since they were allegedly caught fighting with Taliban and al-Qaida forces. Lawyers for the trio challenged the legality of their detention in February, presenting a writ of habeas corpus to a federal court in Washington, in what was the first big legal challenge to the indefinite imprisonment of suspects at Guantanamo Bay. The petition questioned the constitutionality of President George Bush's executive order permitting the detentions, and accused the president, the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and senior officers at the base of denying the detainees the right to a lawyer. It also challenged arguments that the trio did not qualify for full rights under US law because they were foreign citizens captured in a war zone, and because they were being held on territory that is not formally part of the US. Clive Stafford Smith, representing Mr Iqbal and Mr Rasul, last night described the decision by US district judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly as \"the ultimate exercise in hypocrisy\", after she ruled that the US legal system has no jurisdiction over detainees held in Cuba and that writs of habeas corpus did not apply to aliens held outside US territory. \"The court concludes that the military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign territory of the United States,\" she said. Mr Stafford Smith said he would appeal the decision: \"The US says it is fighting this whole war in the cause of democracy and the rule of law. What do they do then? They take these folk to Cuba where for 40 years they have said there is no rule of law and they do so explicitly to deny them of any legal rights. If that isn't ironic I don't know what is. \"The tragedy of the US attitude to this whole terrorism issue is that they are just creating more terrorists because they are illustrating to the entire world that they are not serious about this struggle for democracy.\" He said that if the appeal failed he could see one other option: \"This means the only court that can order the release of these folk is Fidel Castro's. That means it is time for habeas corpus in Havana. If he has a sense of humour he will grant release\". In her ruling, Judge Kollar-Kotelly said the men would not be detained indefinitely as global courts and the UN have the power to inquire about where prisoners are being held and for how long. She also rejected arguments that the prisoners should have the same right to US courts as Cuban citizens who have requested political asylum and gained entry to the US. The trio are being held with more than 550 others in Camp X-ray, a makeshift open-air jail at the base. Yesterday's ruling was a victory for the US justice department, which has consistently argued that the detainees are all \"enemy combatants\" with no rights under the US legal system. In November, Mr Bush ordered the prisoners held without the protection of prisoner of war status on grounds that they are among the most dangerous Taliban and al-Qaida fighters captured in Afghanistan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
