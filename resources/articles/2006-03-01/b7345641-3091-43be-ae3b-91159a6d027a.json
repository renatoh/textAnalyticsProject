He was convicted of causing a public nuisance after scaling a giant TV screen dressed as Spiderman in Hong Kong's main shopping and business district to protest about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. He was released on bail pending an appeal. Pearce said the sentence was heavier than expected and that he believed it was politically motivated. \"I was prepared to go to prison, but it's my first offence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
