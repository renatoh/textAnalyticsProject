It's the slowest draw in the west. It has 32 balls and makes grown men sweat. It's the McDonald's Mastercard Fuji Den Bock Zum Gartner Machen World Cup draw and it's being conducted tonight in Leipzig, Germany. Expect more Teutonic efficiency than you can shake a stick at, despite Lennart Johansson (dressed as Santa Claus) and Sepp Blatter (his elf) taking far too long to explain the relatively straightforward process of dividing 32 teams into eight groups, while Heidi Klum and some bloke, who's even bigger in Germany than David Hasselhoff, add to the gaiety by \"ad-libbing\" bad jokes from an autocue. \"Holland, Australia, United States,\" aah-aah-aahed Sven-Goran Eriksson upon being asked which sides he wanted to avoid, as a Fifa flunky rushed off to place the relevant balls in the fridge. \"I remember in Japan it was awful.\" And while England don't yet know where their matches against Holland, Australia or the USA will be played, tickets for the World Cup final have already gone on sale on eBay, with three having changed hands for \u00a32,201. And while FA rules ban the resale of tickets for England games, eBay was quick to defend itself. \"Until we know England are involved in a game, the sale of tickets for that match is legal,\" they told Lahn's Lahn E'nin' Stannah. Which means you can still get your hands on them up until England's group is decided, from which point you'll be breaking the law and might end up in prison, lying in rags on a filthy straw mattress with your wrist chained to a radiator that's never switched on. Which would be eminently preferable to listening to Australians crowing should the unthinkable happen in Germany. \"We outplayed a decent England team a couple of years ago. If we get them in the group we're pretty confident,\" waah-u-waah-u-waah-u-waahed Australia galahkeeper Mark Schwarzer into his didgeridoo.

It's brilliant for Chelsea, but it's not going to be good for the game\" - Wigan chairman Dave Whelan begs Fifa to stop clubs buying success. Pot, horse, black, kettle, bolted, anyone? ********************* PRIDE (IN THE NAME OF LOVE) As far as the Fiver's aware, there's only one surefire way to revive a flagging career: appeal to your loyal gay following. Kylie Minogue did it. Madonna's in the process of doing it. And the Fiver is planning to follow suit as soon as the buttock-chaffage from our spandex hotpants subsides. Sadly, for reasons of public decency, going disco and grinding suggestively at Mardi Gras isn't available to Sepp Blatter, who this Sunday will attempt to revive his still-born Fifa world club championship. Again. This time Blatter has decided to restrict the tournament to the champions from Fifa's six continental confederations. Liverpool and Sao Paulo, who are widely expected to contest the final, get direct entries into the semis, with Sydney FC, Costa Rica's Deportivo Saprissa, Egypt's Al Ahly and Saudi Arabia's Al Ittihad making up the numbers. It might sound as enticing as a David Platt: My Best Anecdotes DVD, but Sao Paulo coach Paulo Autuori is up for it, insisting: \"It's so important for this club to win.\" The tournament ends on December 18, probably with Liverpool winning on penalties after a stupefying 0-0 draw (and their fans glorifying in the triumph for decades). But, before then, there's a feisty clash between Al Ahly and Al Ittihad to look forward to. The Egyptian champions, currently on a 55-match unbeaten run, reckon at least one of Al Ittihad's four Brazilian players are unregistered - something the club vigorously denies, although a Fifa suit has confirmed they're investigating. Unregistered players sounds a bit Sunday League to us, but, judging by previous world club championships, perhaps that analogy isn't so wide of the mark. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Another week, another William Gallas threatening-to-leave-Chelsea-at-being-made-to-play-out-of-position sulk: Inter and Juve are willing to take him off the Special One's hands. With talks over extending his run at the NUCC having stalled, Shay Given has threatened to walk out. Southampton assistant manager Kevin Bond will follow 'Arry Redknapp back around the M27 to Portsmouth after completing a spell of gardening leave. And League One basement boys Bristol City are planning a double striker swoop for Yeovil's Phil Jevons and Rochdale's Grant Holt. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Benfica have sent a formal complaint to Uefa after Cristiano Ronaldo's one-fingered parting gesture to their fans in midweek. They shouldn't hold their breath for an apology, mind. \"I don't have to justify my gesture. I felt the public treated me badly,\" sniffed Ronaldo. \"They were unsympathetic and so I gave them my answer.\" A photographer who claimed he was attacked by Paul Gascoigne will not be pressing charges against the former England star. \"I can appreciate that, having just lost his job, he has many issues on his mind. I don't want to add to them by taking him to court,\" said Steve Farrell. And Robin van Persie has agreed a new Arsenal contract that will keep him at the Emirates Stadium until 2011. * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS \"Really unimpressed by your witless and tasteless allusion to Simon Weston's horrific injuries in yesterday's Fiver. Usually your humour is spot-on but this was just pointless and not funny.

The fiver's in the post - Fiver Ed]. \"Re: Alex Marklew's letter about Nigel Doughty's trading skills. He did a good bit of business off-loading Andy Reid for \u00a34m.

Literally\" - Mel Gomes. \"Intrigued by Luke from Pompey's complaint about the Fiver's punctuality yesterday, I worked out the average Fiver arrival time for the last month. It was 5.13pm - a mere three minutes off your claim\" - Agus Harnowo. \"At least Luke from Pompey got a copy of Wednesday's Fiver. Mine still hasn't turned up. When it does finally arrive, will that be a record?\" - Andy Gardner. \"Re: the World Cup draw tonight. Have none of the sparks at Fifa thought about the inadvisability of having 'the fastest magician in the world' present on stage whilst the draw is being done. If nothing else, it certainly hands plenty of ammunition to the conspiracy theorists when Germany get their now-traditional bye into the final\" - Craig Keeley. \"Re: Arsenal being the first football club to have aftershave named after them. Surely FC Cologne beat them to it?\" - Dave T. \"So Liverpool fans think that the London-centric press conspires against them by ignoring them in favour of Chelsea. Rubbish! The real conspiracy is against Oxford United, who are consistently overlooked by the national media. We may not be Big Cup holders, but we did win the Milk Cup in 1986, which I think puts us pretty much on a par with Liverpool\" - Nick Smith. \"While Stephen Jones's LFConline rant deserved derision, Liverpool fans aren't the only ones who think everyone's out to get them: http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s379/st86740.htm?fromrss=1\" - Luke Woolly.
