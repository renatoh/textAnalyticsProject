Arsenal had considered this a glorious opportunity to make a statement against the champions, a side languishing in lower mid-table and glancing over their shoulders at those struggling near the foot. Put Chelsea to the sword and, from the top, Arsenal would have had a sense of invincibility. The momentum and conviction would be theirs. Yet now they are third, a team driven to distraction once again by their inability to wound these opponents. Their goalless run against Chelsea in the league now stands at 572 minutes, stretching back three years. They have not beaten them in the Premier League since 2011. It is not just Jos\u00e9 Mourinho who undermines them. 2) Wenger must be sick of the sight of Costa The identity of their tormentor in chief was hardly a surprise, either. Diego Costa has looked more his old self of late, his side-footed finish at the near-post midway through the first half here a sixth goal in as many games. He is running eagerly beyond opposing defences again, a snarling threat on the shoulders of centre-halves. Against Arsenal, the street-fighter in him forever comes to the fore. He had been punished retrospectively for his antics in the win at Stamford Bridge in September, but the sending off he induced from Per Mertesacker this time appeared justified: contact may have been slight, but Costa was running at pace, even if the subsequent series of agonised rolls may have been more for effect. The locals sensed play-acting, though the visiting support merely rejoiced in a chorus of: \u201cDiego Costa, he\u2019s done it again.\u201d Ultimately, he had. 3) The risky decision to sacrifice Giroud backfired Disbelief swept around the stands as the fourth official\u2019s board was hoisted to summon Olivier Giroud from the fray in the wake of Mertesacker\u2019s dismissal. Here was Wenger sacrificing his leading scorer, a player with nine goals in his last 10 matches, and the only natural front man in his pack. There was a logic to the decision on the basis Chelsea would dominate the ball and Arsenal\u2019s most obvious threat would be on the break where Theo Walcott \u2013 captain for the day to celebrate his 10th anniversary at the club \u2013 might be key. Yet, as soon as the hosts trailed, they were blunted. Alexis S\u00e1nchez, who will surely be key to whatever is eventually achieved this season, is still lacking match fitness while Mesut \u00d6zil and Mathieu Flamini were the most advanced central players for long periods. That is never the answer. When chasing the game, they lacked an attacking focal point as Giroud watched on from the stands. 4) F\u00e0bregas revelled on a familiar stage Aside from Costa\u2019s brawn and Willian\u2019s continued excellence, it was another figure \u2013 one Arsenal love to hate \u2013 who held sway. A Chelsea steward lost his job last week for calling Cesc F\u00e0bregas a \u201csnake\u201d, a legacy of the paranoia which festered under the previous management, but this was a performance to cast those accusations aside for good. F\u00e0bregas dictated the play, constantly collecting possession and slipping passes beyond the home defence, re-establishing a supply-line that had been conspicuous in its absence this season. The Spaniard was constantly on the move, aware and inventive, and had 54 touches before the break, 12 more than any other player. He should have won a penalty from Laurent Koscielny in the second half, and the fact he won more tackles at the Emirates than in any other game to date this season is an indication of renewed motivation. 5) Where does this victory leave Chelsea? Still in lower mid-table but, if the unbeaten run since the dismissal of Mourinho had felt rather deceptive, then this was a result to have confidence flooding back. There was an inevitability about it as soon as their lead was established. Chelsea are the only team not to drop any points from winning positions away from home in the top flight this season, albeit only twice, and this was a performance that would have had Mourinho purring, born of power and control in central midfield. Chelsea have been pigeon-stepping up the table of late, but this win has put them within touching distance of that cluster of clubs just below the top six. The top four, still 14 points away, feel like dots on the horizon but those in the middle ground will be disconcerted by the presence stirring at their backs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
