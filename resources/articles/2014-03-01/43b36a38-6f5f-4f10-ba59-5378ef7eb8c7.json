Unlike football, there is no broad market of elite Australian Rules players to tap into. Teams have to be developed, necessitating a sustained period of struggle. Still, you can\u2019t help feeling that GWS has done it harder than any other introduced team. The league\u2019s administrators didn\u2019t help, saddling the club with an unwieldy name, the indignity of orange and an indistinct representative area divided across about a dozen \u201chome\u201d grounds. Even with AFL backing, GWS couldn\u2019t attract an elite player in the Gary Ablett mould. They settled for overpaying mid-range or unproven talents such as Callan Ward, Phil Davis, Tom Scully and Rhys Palmer; luring back footballing pensioners such as Chad Cornes, Dean Brogan and Luke Power; and recycling discards such as Setanta \u00d3 hAilp\u00edn. Even the Giants\u2019 rugby league-poaching gimmick failed, while Gold Coast\u2019s might actually have found them a player.The Giants were poised to register a winless season last year but ran into a Melbourne side in the depths of their own misery. Over the year GWS conceded 1,472 more points than the league\u2019s best defence \u2013 nearly double Fremantle\u2019s tally \u2013 while the best attacking side outscored them by 999. At season\u2019s end, Lance Franklin passed up their big-money offer in favour of the other Sydney, at which point chairman Tony Shepherd said GWS were relieved and didn\u2019t want him anyway. This raises questions about whether Tony Shepherd is in the habit of offering $7.2m for things he doesn\u2019t want, because I\u2019ve got a bunch of broken lawn furniture he could look at. This season, then, will be all about finding whatever positives the Giants can. Franklin aside, the club had their best summer yet for recruiting. Shane Mumford is one of the best mobile ruckmen and most imposing physical presences in the game, and will bring a level of authority that the Giants\u2019 youngsters can\u2019t. Heath Shaw is a fine rebounding defender who needed a change of scene after 173 games with Collingwood, and should still be in peak form. The hulking Josh Hunt was a familiar presence in Geelong\u2019s premiership-era backline and has another year or two in him, while former Sydney Swan forward Jed Lamb is highly rated despite his handful of games. The Giants\u2019 key-position stocks are also looking good. Jeremy Cameron is the first of their home-grown players to fully flourish, nailing the All-Australian full forward spot, no less, with just 37 games to his name. Jonathon Patton will be back from injury this year and will likely play from the same goal square, while the much-hyped No1 draft pick Tom Boyd is of similar stature. There are almost two teams within a team at GWS: the mature recruits and the original draftees. With their privileged access to drafts, GWS have a slew of the best young running players in the country. It\u2019s just a matter of who among them will develop into top-line footballers. Toby Greene has attracted plenty of attention from opposing taggers, while Adam Treloar is highly rated. Last year the pair averaged 23 and 24 disposals respectively. Ward and Scully will continue to lead where they can, while Lachie Whitfield and Dylan Shiel are two more impressive customers. Of course, their list is still largely young \u2013 the summer\u2019s recruits aside, there are just five Giants who have played more than 50 games. This means they should come last, but the disaster that St Kilda has become might just lift them off the bottom of the table for the first time. However bad GWS are this year, we can still get excited about their potential. It\u2019s about seeing which players develop soonest. The club has had so many good draft picks that in another six to eight years, we are likely to see an absolute dynamite list. 2014 may at times be painful to watch, but if you want to own part of the true satisfaction of the rise, you have to get in on the ground floor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
