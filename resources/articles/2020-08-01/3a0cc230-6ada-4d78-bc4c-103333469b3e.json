Most of the time their 28-year age gap makes no difference, but very occasionally it\u2019s noticeable. Yet coordinating a tandem bike is tricky for most couples and, says Michael, their differences are part of what strengthens their relationship. \u201cI made her old and she\u2019s made me young. We do old-person things like go to the wineries and that sort of stuff on the weekends, but we also scuba dive and I now ride a motorbike,\u201d says Michael. \u201cWe share those things and so we\u2019ve learnt from each other, and I think that\u2019s important.\u201d The Adelaide couple have been together for almost 15 years. They met when she was 19 and he was 47. They were both working in retail at a shopping centre in Toowoomba. Their shops were next door to each other and they would chat when things were quiet. Gradually their conversations went from \u201cDo you want a coffee?\u201d to \u201cWant to get a coffee?\u201d. Michael was taken with her from the start: \u201cI thought she was not only extraordinarily attractive but a really fun person. I enjoyed talking to her. Quite often, when you\u2019re more mature, so to speak, and you talk to someone young, you often see them as vacuous or less worldly. But Alyce was not like that and so we could actually have pleasant conversations.\u201d She was oblivious: \u201cI was just like, \u2018This is a friendly guy.\u2019 And my work colleagues would be like, \u2018Hmm, he\u2019s always talking to you.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no, he\u2019s just friendly. What are you talking about?\u2019\u201d Things stepped up a notch when he walked her to her car one afternoon and kissed her. Initially he didn\u2019t get the reaction he hoped for. Alyce agrees: \u201cI was going for a kiss on the cheek and he went for a full-on pash, and I was like, \u2018Whoa, that was not what I expected.\u2019 Finally it dawned on her. \u201c[I realised] \u2018Oh, you want a bit more? OK, well, we\u2019ll pursue this, then.\u2019\u201d Their connection quickly deepened. \u201cIt was very physical at the beginning,\u201d says Alyce. \u201cWe were very passionate with each other [but] the more that we spoke, the more that we [realised we] had things in common.\u201d She adds: \u201cI was just in awe of learning from him \u2026 he always wanted to talk to me. He had this life before me. He was in the RAAF for 23 years, he was so high up ... I was absolutely mesmerised by this man.\u201d They had a short fling while they were living in Toowoomba, then Michael moved to Wagga Wagga. Alyce followed. It was \u201cdecision time\u201d, says Michael, so they moved in together. About 18 months later they moved to Adelaide. Then, just before Alyce\u2019s 21st birthday, they decided to get married \u2013 in secret. \u201cThe marriage was 100% my decision,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m [Mike\u2019s] third wife so he\u2019s done the full wedding days both times and I\u2019d never really wanted to have a wedding day ... I was more inclined to spend that money on saving up for a house or trying for a baby [and] I always think that it\u2019s more important to have a marriage rather than a wedding day.\u201d Everyone was in Adelaide for Alyce\u2019s birthday so the couple announced it at the party. \u201cLet\u2019s say the reactions were mixed,\u201d Michael says. Eventually everyone came round and now they all get on famously. They\u2019ve become used to the curiosity about the age difference. \u201cYou get looks [walking] down the street,\u201d says Alyce. \u201cAt first, we\u2019d kind of play up to it, sometimes we just ignore it. Then when someone does mention it, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh yeah, I suppose he\u2019s older than me \u2013 I completely forgot.\u2019\u201d Although Michael has a son from a previous marriage, the couple tried for a family after they were married. They tried IVF for five years, to no avail. They got through it together, attending every blood test and appointment together. \u201cWhen I\u2019d be sitting in the waiting room or in the room with her, I often saw these women there by themselves and I thought to myself, \u2018Aren\u2019t you getting the sort of support that you\u2019d need through this?\u201d Michael says. \u201cBecause it is very stressful, both physically and emotionally.\u201d Experience has made him wise to what makes a successful relationship: \u201cI look back on my failed marriages and I think, \u2018Yeah, look, I could\u2019ve done better.\u2019 And hopefully I\u2019ve learnt from that and now do things better and maybe that\u2019s just experience ... You\u2019re probably more selfish when you\u2019re younger, and as you get older you start realising that. I think the way to a happy relationship is to put your partner first and put their interests above your own. That way, if they do the same thing, then you\u2019re both going to be really happy.\u201d After they\u2019d made their peace with not having children, Alyce started studying and now has a PhD in animal science. They share an interest in animals and the environment, and seeing her studying inspired Michael to go back to university \u2013 he now has a PhD in environmental biology. While Alyce was studying for her PhD, she lived in Queensland to do data collection and lab work. For her first year, she did it on her own, which was challenging for the couple. The following year, Michael left his job in the public service and joined her. They lived in a small caravan while they both studied. It was testing at times, living in such close quarters, but also fun. \u201cI\u2019d walk in exhausted, covered in dust and poo and pee, and he\u2019d just hand me a drink and ask me about my day and it was perfect,\u201d Alyce says. Affection is important to both of them. \u201cSitting on the couch, watching television, we\u2019re holding hands,\u201d says Alyce. \u201cJust touching each other constantly.\u201d In the early days of their relationship, their roles were quite traditional, but these days things have flipped, as Alyce has a demanding job as a researcher in animal reproduction while Michael is semi-retired and looks after their home. Some of their happiest moments are when they cook together. \u201cWe stand in the kitchen with a glass of wine, cooking dinner together,\u201d Michael says. \u201cI go out to the garden and get some fresh herbs from my own garden, which is one of my favourite things to do. Those sort of bonding things, I think, are absolutely fantastic.\u201d Their commitment to each other is unwavering. \u201cEvery marriage has its ups and downs and it\u2019s during the downs that I\u2019ve learnt that you can\u2019t quit it,\u201d Alyce says. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together and I think that has been reinforced over the years. This is a man who has accepted me for who I am and I love him more than anything in this world; just loving him and accepting him wholeheartedly.\u201d Michael agrees: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have days when things don\u2019t go according to plan. It\u2019s how you manage it and deal with it. Rather than turn it into a shouting match and accusing the other of whatever, it\u2019s saying, \u2018Look, let\u2019s resolve this.\u2019 I think that\u2019s probably a lesson I have learnt.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping things in perspective,\u201d he adds. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to sit back and think, \u2018If I chuck the towel in, will things get better or worse? I love this woman, if things are going bad, what\u2019s tomorrow going to bring and how can we fix the issues rather than causing splits? \u201cWe\u2019re obviously different \u2013 non-traditional, if you will \u2013 but there\u2019s no reason why those things can\u2019t work if you set your mind to it.\u201d Michael often looks at younger couples and wishes he could share some of the lessons he\u2019s learnt: \u201cI wish I could say to them, \u2018Things will get better if you deal with these issues and don\u2019t let them bother you.\u2019\u201d He adds: \u201cSometimes it takes a few to get it right. It\u2019s hard to give advice because you don\u2019t know people\u2019s personal situations. But if you focus on the positives rather than the negatives, I think that\u2019s probably the best advice I would ever give anybody.\u201d \u2022 We want to hear your stories about staying together.
