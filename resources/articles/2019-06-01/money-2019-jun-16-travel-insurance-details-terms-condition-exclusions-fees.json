Two weeks before their holiday her father became seriously ill and she had to cancel. He died soon afterwards. Since the payment was non-refundable, Taylor claimed the \u00a3646 cost on her travel insurance. To her astonishment, she was told that she was only entitled to half that. \u201cI was told it was because there were two people travelling, and my policy paid out on a per-person basis,\u201d she says. \u201cI argued that the cost for the week was \u00a3646 for the cottage, irrespective of the number of people, the entire booking was in my name only and I was the only person who had suffered any financial loss. How can my mum be expected to make a claim when her name does not appear anywhere on the booking confirmation?\u201d Taylor is one of thousands of holidaymakers who find themselves left out of pocket by caveats tucked away in the small print of travel insurance. As insurers compete to offer the lowest prices on comparison websites, fees and exclusions have been quietly rising. Inflated excess charges, inadequate cover for illness or cancellation, and refusal to pay out for lost possessions without proof of ownership can make a cheap policy costly. Some companies use the omission of a middle name, or failure to declare an inconsequential past ailment, as an excuse. Last year, the Observer reported the case of Juliet Thomas, who was left with a bill of \u00a330,000 after being diagnosed with a kidney tumour while on holiday. Her insurer, Coverwise, refused to cover the cost because she had failed to declare a previous prescription of sleeping tablets when buying the policy. Although her brief insomnia was unrelated to the tumour, Coverwise\u2019s underwriter, Axa, insisted it disqualified her because she had bought a basic policy designed for those with no recent health issues. Axa was also the underwriter for Taylor\u2019s American Express annual gold policy. The company told the Observer: \u201cTo keep premiums down, most travel insurers only pay for the insured person\u2019s proportion if a trip is cancelled \u2013 additional travellers will need to submit their own claims. This is one of the many reasons every person should be fully insured.\u201d Axa has since paid Taylor the full cost of the holiday. Onerous excess charges are one of the most common stings. These can be as much as \u00a3300 and some insurers apply them to different parts of a single claim. If a handbag is stolen with a phone and purse inside, the phone and bag would be classed under \u201cpersonal possessions\u201d and cash under \u201cpersonal money\u201d, with an excess payable on both. Others charge for each person on a policy even if it\u2019s a single claim, rendering some cover worthless. A family of four claiming \u00a31,000 cancellation cover could face a combined excess of \u00a31,200 \u2013 more than the cost of their trip. Julie Annakin was on holiday with her husband when his wallet containing \u00a3200 was stolen. \u201cI contacted Nationwide to claim on our FlexPlus policy,\u201d she says. \u201cI was asked who the money belonged to and replied it was both of us. I was then told we would have to pay double the excess, even though it was a single claim. This is discrimination against couples and a cautionary tale that it\u2019s not in their best interest to admit a joint account.\u201d Nationwide says its conditions state \u00a350 will be deducted from a claim for each insured person. \u201cFlexPlus members can claim up to \u00a3250 cash for each insured person,\u201d it says. \u201cDepending on the amount, they may need to submit a separate claim. The decision to apply two excesses was in line with the policy as the member confirmed both of them were making a claim. However, as a gesture of goodwill, UKI \u2013 which provides the insurance \u2013 agreed the refund.\u201d Anna Sant of price comparison site Moneysupermarket warns against being lured by the cheapest price. \u201cIt can often result in paying double or even triple in excess costs,\u201d she warns. \u201cIt could be more cost efficient to opt for a slightly higher premium with a lower excess.\u201d Choose the wrong cover and you could be left with the cost of medical expenses, repatriation and lost cash or passport. Some insurers refuse to pay out if alcohol has been consumed, and most basic cover does not include an airline going bust. One of the cheapest policies shown by Moneysupermarket for a couple travelling to France for a week is \u00a38.99 from Cheaper Travel Insurance. An excess of \u00a3250 is charged per person per claim and the maximum payable to each traveller is \u00a3750 for cancellation and \u00a3500 for lost baggage. A \u00a32 upgrade from this \u201cbronze\u201d deal to \u201cgold\u201d shrinks the excess to \u00a3100, adds \u00a3250 to each person\u2019s cancellation cover and doubles the lost baggage allowance to \u00a31,000. It requires a complex juggling of figures and a dig deep into fine print to deduce which policies offer the best value. Last year, the Financial Ombudsman Service ruled in favour of only 31% of insurance customers, in part because many of those who felt they had been unfairly treated had not read the terms and conditions. As it says: \u201cIt\u2019s important to read the terms and conditions carefully. If you\u2019re unsure, ask your provider to explain if there are any charges you may face when claiming, or anything that your policy doesn\u2019t cover.\u201d Checklist: what to look for \u2022 Medical cover should be at least \u00a31m for travel within Europe and \u00a32m in the US. Check if repatriation in a medical emergency is included. \u2022 Ensure cancellation or curtailment cover exceeds your losses. Look for at least \u00a32,000 if a holiday is cancelled. \u2022 Does it include a payout if you miss your flight or train for reasons outside your control? \u2022 Not all policies cover lost or delayed baggage and some insist on receipts before reimbursing lost possessions. Items over a certain value are usually separate. Look for cover of at least \u00a31,500. \u2022 Does it contain personal liability cover if you are sued for damages for injury, or damage? Aim for a policy that will offer \u00a32m or more. \u2022 Basic policies may exclude dental treatment, airline failure, terrorist acts and payment for lost cash, tickets or passports. \u2022 Check the amount of the excess and whether it is payable per person and/or per section of a claim. \u2022 There are policies available with no excess, for peace of mind, although these are more expensive and there is less choice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
