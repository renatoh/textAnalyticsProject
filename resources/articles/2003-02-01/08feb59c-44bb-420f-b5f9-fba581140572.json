Higher education had expanded rapidly but the growth was in honours degrees rather than the intermediate level. Companies said there was a shortage of higher technicians and numbers on Higher National Diploma courses were falling. The new two-year degree was designed to replace HNDs - today the examinations board Edexcel said it was converting its HND courses into foundation degrees. Universities were invited to bid to run pilot foundation degrees alongside local further education colleges and employers. The goal is a programme that \"delivers the specialist knowledge which employers require yet is also underpinned by rigorous and broad-based, academic learning\", according to the Department for Education and Skills. Students get credits for their existing experience and qualifications and there should be active links between a student's work experience and academic study. The 40 pilot courses in 21 universities in 2000 all guaranteed students that they would be able to progress to a full honours degree if they wished after performing satisfactorily - taking only one year and a term of extra study. A further 13 consortia were added the following year. But this guarantee is now being reconsidered, Margaret Hodge, the higher education minister, revealed to the Commons education committee yesterday. Ministers now want the foundation degree to stand in its own right as a recognised qualification. She singled out a foundation degree at Kingston University in aircraft engineering, developed with the airline KLM and the aviation training standards association, as a good example of a university working closely with employers to produce a qualification that led to jobs. Other pilot programmes included foundation degrees for classroom assistants at Lancaster and Leicester, e-business at Sunderland, Newcastle and Northumbria universities, tourism at Plymouth and Bournemouth, hospitality at Oxford Brookes and professional photography at the Surrey Institute of art and design."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
