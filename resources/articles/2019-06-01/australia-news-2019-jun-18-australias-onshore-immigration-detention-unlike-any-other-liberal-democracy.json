It is also now holding people for an average of about 500 days \u2013 far longer than any comparable jurisdiction, and is increasingly using restraints. The commission urged the Australian government to \u201ctake very seriously\u201d its latest report, which examined risk management in detention and was released on Tuesday. \u201cAustralia\u2019s system of mandatory immigration detention \u2013 combined with ministerial guidelines that preclude the consideration of community alternatives to detention for certain groups \u2013 continues to result in people being detained when there is no valid justification for their ongoing detention under international law,\u201d it said. The report found that amid a growing proportion of people being detained on \u201ccharacter grounds\u201d and corresponding structural changes to make centres more secure, all detainees, including young female asylum seekers, were being subject to harsher and harsher treatment. It makes 34 recommendations to the Australian government to reduce the severity of restrictions on detainees, to provide more social and education services, improve staff training and review processes, and release more people into community detention. \u201cAustralia really is unlike any other liberal democracy in the immigration detention system, it is especially restrictive and especially harsh,\u201d said commissioner Edward Santow. \u201cParticularly over the last 12-18 months it\u2019s certainly the case that a lot of refurbishment have been done that make them more like prisons,\u201d he said, citing higher fences and other prison-like design features. \u201cAnd the conditions themselves are consistent with that.\u201d Guardian Australia has previously reported on arbitrary rule changes around visitors and gifts, including \u201cfarcical\u201d drug tests blocking visitor access and the alleged refusal to allow gifts of baby food to detained mothers. There have been multiple incidents, alleged acts of violence, and deaths inside the network of onshore detention centres. The report found Australia is also now holding people for longer \u2013 an average of around 500 days, which Santow said \u201cshould not be considered acceptable\u201d. The report said risks to human rights increased the longer a person was held in immigration detention, and Australia was holding people for periods \u201cmany orders of magnitude greater than almost any other developed country\u201d. Canada\u2019s average length of closed immigration detention didn\u2019t exceed one month between 2012-13 and 2017-18, and 80% of the people leaving UK detention between 2012 and 2017 had been held for two months or less. The commission\u2019s report, based on extensive interviews with detainees and staff last year, found the use of restraints during escorts \u2013 including for medical appointments \u2013 had become routine and potentially disproportionate. \u201cThere was one example where a [mobile] dental van \u2026 drove into the detention centre itself. It was within the walls or fences, and even then detainees were reporting to us they were still being required to wear handcuffs to see the dentist.\u201d Santow said there were multiple reports of medical practitioners requesting restraints be removed from the detainees they were treating, and officers would usually comply. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be something left to the medical practitioner to intervene.\u201d It reiterated calls for a review into the use of restraints \u201cto ensure people in detention are not subject to more restrictive measures than are necessary in their individual circumstances\u201d, the report said. \u201cHome Affairs has indicated that its \u2018position in relation to its use of force settings remains unchanged\u2019.\u201d The report also found transfers between centres often occurred without notice and took people away from family. While there were exceptional circumstances that warranted sudden transfers, they did not appear to be justified in all cases and detainees often felt they were being punished. There were also somer fears among other detainees, including asylum seekers and visa overstayers, about being held in the same facility as people with criminal histories. Several people reported acts of violence, which the commission passed on to authorities \u2013 however there have been previous concerns that assaults and other incidents are not properly investigated. \u201cA lot of people said they trusted the staff and that staff did what they could to protect and investigate,\u201d Santow said. \u201cThere were a number of others who essentially said the opposite \u2013 that if they made a complaint they had no confidence it would be properly investigated.\u201d The report also called for a review of staff\u2019s response to an incident at the Yongah Hill detention centre last year, where several buildings were burned down after a young detainee attempted to take his own life at the centre. He later died in hospital. The commission said while such a disturbance was a significant challenge and the lack of injury to staff or detainees was a \u201ccommendable\u201d outcome\u201d there were several concerns including the lack of any bedding or alternative shelter for detainees afterwards, and confusion during the incident about whether people were in danger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
