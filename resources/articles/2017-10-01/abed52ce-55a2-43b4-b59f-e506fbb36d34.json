Danny Lloyd, who played Danny Torrance, the boy zooming around the Overlook hotel on the tricycle, has also given an interview. Now 45 and a biology professor in Kentucky, Lloyd, a regular kid when cast, says that he has many great memories and one sad one \u2013 a broken promise that he\u2019d be given the tricycle at the end of filming (\u201cRedrum!\u201d indeed). Lloyd also said that, although he got no further with acting, he always felt that he\u2019d \u201cwon the lottery\u201d with The Shining and didn\u2019t envy child stars of today. What a great attitude and also what a contrast. In 1980, Lloyd was pining for a tricycle; these days, a breakthrough child star would be eyeing up a Netflix series at least. And good luck to them, but I\u2019m with Lloyd. He wasn\u2019t in any old film, he was in the film \u2013 a masterpiece that is still remembered nearly 40 years later; as of course is he."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
