Johanna Konta put the home team on the board in the first match on day one, recovering from a slow start to beat the world No 107, Zarina Diyas, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in two hours and 38 minutes. The second singles was a mere seven minutes shorter but it seemed longer as the Kazakh terrier Yulia Putintseva saved three match points to beat Katie Boulter, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (6). The reverse singles on Sunday are equally hard to call, and Konta\u2019s showdown at high noon with Putintseva \u2013 the world No 38, who shocked her in the first round of the French Open last year when 97 in the world \u2013 will set the tone for the drama\u2019s closing act. Anne Keothavong\u2019s tight-knit squad remain buoyant, however, knowing victory in this World Group II play-off would return Great Britain to the competition\u2019s elite level for the first time in 26 years. The 5,000 fans who filled the arena could hardly have asked for more sustained entertainment on Saturday. After a minute\u2019s applause in memory of the Davis Cup and British tennis stalwart Paul Hutchins, the spirit of the cup was stretched to perfectly acceptable limits as a witty Kazakh ensemble of two drums, a trumpet and trombone provided a raucous soundtrack to the hosts\u2019 encouraging start. There were some dubious interruptions, however, when over-enthusiastic travelling fans angered Konta with calls mid-shot as she butchered a volley on set point in the first frame, and again in the second set. \u201cYou need to find your feet in these [noisy] surroundings,\u201d said Konta, who trailed 5-1 in the first set before grinding her way back to parity and finishing with a convincing flourish. \u201cIt does shock you, but every Fed Cup it takes a bit of time to get used to. You get a bit more resilient as the match goes on. I didn\u2019t get bogged down too much.\u201d As for the intermittent offerings of Kazakhstan\u2019s answer to Kenny Ball \u2013 who broke into a decent rendition of It Ain\u2019t Necessarily So when Diyas pulled off a couple of stunning winners \u2013 Konta said: \u201cI was in two minds, because he was bloody good.\u201d Diyas said later: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was too much noise. It\u2019s normal when you play in the Fed Cup. I didn\u2019t think it affected her. There were British fans cheering also.\u201d She expects a minor shoulder strain to recover in time for her match against Boulter: \u201cI\u2019ll be fine \u2013 nothing serious.\u201d There is minor concern over Boulter, who needed off-court treatment at 1-2 in the second set. \u201cI was just struggling a bit physically,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be OK for tomorrow.\u201d Boulter, who impressed with her tenacity in the previous tie in Bath, had a famous win on her racket, but Putintseva dug deep to force the tie-break and was relieved to see her young opponent waste two easy volleys in a see-sawing finish. \u201cShe surprised me because she was able to keep her level up the whole match,\u201d Putintseva said of Boulter. Boulter said: \u201cI\u2019m devastated. It\u2019s difficult to give an answer right now. I put everything out there, as I always do. All you can do is keep doing it. It was a really high level. I expected her to play well. That\u2019s why she is ranked where she is. It\u2019s tough to lose match points but I\u2019m going to get over it.\u201d Keothavong said: \u201cKatie put herself in a great position against a very good player. She just doesn\u2019t go away. Katie gave everything she had but Yulia was able to ride the challenge. We\u2019re still very much in this. We expected it to be this tough.\u201d Konta\u2019s challenge is ramped up on Sunday when she takes on Putintseva. They have history. \u201cI lost to her in Paris,\u201d Konta said, referring to last year\u2019s early exit at Roland Garros, a defeat that began a slide to 46 in the world. \u201cShe\u2019s incredibly feisty, a pocket rocket. She\u2019ll be there until the very last point.\u201d Indeed \u2013 just ask Boulter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
