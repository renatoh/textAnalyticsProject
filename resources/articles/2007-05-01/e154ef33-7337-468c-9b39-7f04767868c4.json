Jack Straw, backing an odds-on winner once again, was pumped with it. The Brown lieutenants dripped with it. The bussed-in party members who made up yesterday's audience basked in it. The man himself, new haircut and smiling fit to bust, exuded it. And why not? This is his moment. He wants the power. He deserves it. He's ready for it. He'll get it. But did the launch do any business for those with a less personal stake in the Brown premiership? What will they make of it out there in the Britain in whose name Brown now seeks to succeed Blair? We got an outline yesterday of how Brown intends to accomplish his biggest political task of all - breaking with the past without repudiating it. But these are very early days to give anything like settled answers to this large question. We must all give the man a chance and allow him to grow into his new role before passing that judgment. Brown's chief tasks yesterday were to avoid mistakes, to set his own tone and to get the public interested in what he offers. Not even the clumsy and most un-New Labour mismanagement of his autocues could disguise the fact that he got most of these things right. Yes, it was a solid rather than a spectacular start. But that's Brown; this is a long game, and there is method there. At least there were no embarrassing gimmicks, no straining for false effects, and nothing to make you wince - as there might once have been. The launch of this campaign was full of the unnervingly focused young people who populate all modern political parties, but at least Brown - who seems to have been middle-aged from the age of about 12 - made no attempt to pretend he is one of them. Instead the chancellor offered himself as he is, not as some consultant might like him to be. Brown's USPs are as he stated them yesterday: ideas, vision and experience. He pooh-poohed the thought that politics might ever be about celebrity. I'm not sure that he truly believes this, though he has clearly learned from the debacle over his Arctic Monkeys comments. But surely someone can persuade him that seriousness does not have to be quite this dull. Listening to Brown answer a question can be like listening to the weather forecast. You know it contains important information and you try to take it in, but somehow your mind is always drawn elsewhere so that you miss the crucial bit and have to ask someone what has just been said. The fear among his New Labour critics was that Brown would instinctively aim his launch - as the deputy leadership candidates also risk doing - at party activists rather than the wider electorate. His speech gave no support to that charge. Brown pressed the buttons that any New Labour big-tent purist could have reasonably expected him to press. Everything was cast in terms of country, not party. There was no cringeing to the unions, no comfort for opponents of public-service reform. The campaign launched in England not Scotland. After his speech Brown travelled straight to marginal Stevenage, a seat without which there can be no Labour government. There will be more such visits next week. These are the places and the voters with which he has to engage above all others. But Brown has to reconnect with the core Labour vote as well as focus on the swing voters in the marginals. He knows better than anyone else that this is a treacherously difficult tightrope to walk - and that the Conservatives will pounce like hawks on any mistake he makes. There was not much substance about the new offer he intends to make - constitutional reform and parliamentary accountability, hints about Iraq and ID cards. Will the lost Guardian-reading Labour voter really be as enthralled as Brown hopes at the prospect of greater scrutiny powers for MPs? There's nothing wrong with that, but it feels like a 19th-century solution to a 21st-century problem. He might have done better by simply saying that he will ringfence the arts budget as long as he is in power. There are more votes in the arts than in parliamentary reform. But Brown also needs to counter-attack against the critics for whom no Labour government is ever good enough. At yesterday's launch Brown was called on to explain how the gap between rich and poor has grown wider during his decade at the Treasury. He gave his answer in classic weather forecast mode; prolix, long paragraphs, detailed and never quite to the point. It was a missed opportunity both in style and political substance. Brown could - and should - have hit back that this is a lazy claim. In fact, as an excellent letter in the New Statesman points out this week, Labour's tax and benefit changes since 1997 have raised incomes for the poorest 20% of British families by 12% and have cut them for the top 10% of families by about 5%. Though the very rich have pulled away, here as in other countries, Labour has done a lot of solid redistribution that it must find a more confident way of celebrating. To find a way of extolling these social democratic values without threatening the party's enviable record of economic management is Labour's biggest challenge in negotiating the inescapably complex legacy of the Blair decade as effectively as possible. That legacy is much richer than those who can see only Iraq, sleaze and spin ever allow. Yet this is a very fragile political moment for the government. Blair's departure may trigger a public reassessment that will help not just his own reputation but also Brown and Labour in small but important ways. But only a fool - of whom there are plenty around, although Brown is emphatically not one of them - would ignore the powerful point made by Matthew d'Ancona in the Spectator this week that the party is about to feel the absence of the human shield that has stood between Labour and the public for the past 13 years. The message of the polls is that the country wants a change. Blair's departure is necessarily part of that. But is Brown's arrival part of it too? Or is the message of the disastrous May elections that Labour's cause is beyond rescue? The answer now depends on Gordon Brown and on every signal he sends out in the decisive weeks that lie ahead before the summer recess. martin.kettle@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
