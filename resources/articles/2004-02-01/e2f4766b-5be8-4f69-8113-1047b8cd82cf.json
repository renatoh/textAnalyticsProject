Not physically, but socially. I can match the pace of our 15-strong group, but when you walk with ATG Oxford you walk with the elite. 'We've had dames of the realm and high court judges and retired Cabinet Ministers on our holidays,' whispers one veteran. 'But the company is very discreet about its clients.' It is the first full day of 'Painters and Gardens of Provence', a themed itinerary at the gentle end of the walking specialist's programme. The company also offers hikes across more rugged terrain, with greater opportunities for solitude, that might have suited me better. In my book walking is a private, taciturn activity, but an ambition to explore on foot the landscapes of C\u00e9zanne and Van Gogh is irresistibly simplified by this enterprise, and I'm primed to engage with its sociability. 'Like an itinerant cocktail party!' explains Fenella who has exuberantly appointed herself hostess. For once I'm among the younger guests at the party. Excluding our escorts (Jessica, who handles the tour logistics, and Maurice, who leads the walks) the average age is about 65. There is a female octogenarian who has climbed some of the toughest mountains in Scotland, a couple of fortysomethings, and a range of mature or retired professionals in between. No dames but a preponderance of medical consultants and lawyers. Most are well-travelled, beautifully mannered and tactfully affluent. As well they might be; their week's ramble costs upwards of \u00a32,000 each, all found. And if an army marches on its stomach these foot soldiers of the leisure industry march on a very superior organ, not to mention a refined palate. ATG picnics are legendary; there is even a cookbook dedicated to their alfresco cuisine. Dinners, in the best of local restaurants, are an education in regional gastronomy and viniculture. As we size each other up there is respectful silence when Jessica describes our first menu: 'Chilled artichoke soup, salad of coriander and parmesan, sea bass baked in its skin with potato and olive oil puree, dark chocolate pudding...' Any chance we'll walk it all off? Not a lot. We stay four nights in Arles, based in the eccentric Grand H\u00f4tel Nord-Pinus, once favoured by the more cultured glitterati, then move to Aix-en-Provence. We walk no more than five hours a day, usually less, and the longest route is seven miles. There is only one serious hill: Mont Sainte-Victoire, already mapped in our heads by Paul C\u00e9zanne, who painted it more than 60 times. The great, lop-sided, free-standing massif which commands the countryside between the Luberon hills and the northern suburbs of Marseille becomes a haunting presence in the corner of my eye. But before we reach it busy days lie ahead - don't imagine we put our feet up between walks. Jessica and Maurice have arranged a programme of high-grade sightseeing; what the French might call visites p\u00e9dagogiques. The itinerary allows for some flexibility, which is just as well; autumnal rain has exploded the mosquito population of the Camargue, and the tiny terrorists have penetrated the ramparts of Arles. Someone counts 49 bites within 24 hours, and I've collected some two dozen. The pharmacies of the old Roman town have never had it so good, and Maurice strategically decides to cancel the nature walk through the salt marshes. 'We can show you the flamingos, bulls and horses from the minibuses, and we've got a very special restaurant planned for the evening.' No hype. As dusk falls over the Etang de Vaccar\u00e8s, sending egrets to their roosts and flamingos on to one leg, we arrive at a lonely farmhouse. La Telline is locally cele brated for its bouillabaisse. The young chef-patron and his wife have spent three days brewing up the soup, and now present for our inspection a variety of choice fish to be grilled over the fire before our eyes. Unusually, the fish is served separately from the soup, and the quantities of both would see us through the week. Each day the sun glows more strongly behind thin, opalescent cloud until soon we are walking with the lightness of angels through the celestial light of Provence: through olive groves and pine woods to Roman mills and aqueducts, over upland paths clumped with rosemary and thyme, beneath the wrinkled limestone wall of the Alpilles, across meadows studded with holm oaks to lunch in their shade. Early each morning Jessica raids the markets for cheeses, pat\u00e9s, saucissons, olives, regional breads such as the hard, spicy fougasse bread, fruit and vegetables, which she transforms in the minibus 'kitchen' into salads of rare inventiveness. There is vin de pays for those who can handle it (the finer wines are saved for dinner) and by early afternoon the 'itinerant cocktail party' is in full swing. I'm chased along our route to the Roman aqueduct Pont du Gard by fragments of conversation: 'Our local book club... My brother was at Worcester College... When we were living in Northern Rhodesia...' It sometimes seems that everyone wants to talk about anything other than the sights, smells and sounds of the moment. But with charming authority Maurice manages to redirect attention to the experience at hand: the visible legacy of conquest, trade, religion and husbandry which shaped the landscapes of Provence before they became familiar from some of the most famous paintings of the last century. At Arles we see the Alyscamps, the Roman necropolis that fascinated Van Gogh and Gauguin; the Caf\u00e9 La Nuit, freshly painted sunflower yellow; the swing bridge at Langlois, repositioned since it posed for Van Gogh; the ramparts of the Rh\u00f4ne, where he painted Starry Night ; and St Paul de Mausole, the psychiatric hospital in St R\u00e9my de Provence where the tormented artist produced more than 100 paintings. We aren't short of painters but where are the gardens? The Proven\u00e7al landscape is one big garden, wild or cultivated, but we also spend time in a splendid potager, the ornamental kitchen garden of the Chteau Val Joanis, and sample some wine from this Luberon vineyard. And from the expansive gardens of our Aix hotel, Le Pigonnet, we observe the spot where the obsessed C\u00e9zanne did a study of Mont Sainte-Victoire. Finally, we climb the mountain itself, reaching its 940m summit by a stiff, rocky path to eat lunch at the top with 46 Breton 11-year-olds whose vivacious chatter is courteous and whose mountain manners are disciplined well by their teachers. Inexhaustible to the end, we take in one last garden en route to Marseille airport. I have other plans, so wave them off from Le Pigonnet with regret and relief. I imagine them talking their way round the seventeenth-century Jardins d'Albertas: 'Have you seen the Eden Project yet?' I shall miss them. But I'm looking forward to sitting alone on Aix's Cours Mirabeau, drinking a caf\u00e9 cr\u00eame and reading Alphonse Daudet's melancholy tale of M. Seguin's little white goat. Factfile 'Painters and Gardens of Provence' walks take place this year in April and October. They cost \u00a32,174 per person based on two sharing, which includes flights from London to Toulouse, seven nights' accommodation in four-star hotels plus all meals, wine, excursions, transfers and services of guides. The single supplement for a double room is \u00a3281. More information from ATG Oxford (01865 315678/9)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
