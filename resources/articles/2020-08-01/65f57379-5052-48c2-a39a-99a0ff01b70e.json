Paul Hansen was given 24 hours to leave the country and banned from Belarus for five years. He was one of 50 reporters rounded up by riot police on Thursday and taken into custody, ostensibly so their documents could be checked. One of those detained was the BBC\u2019s Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg. Most of the journalists were later released but four Minsk-based correspondents were detained overnight and appeared in court on Friday, charged with organising illegal protests. They included the photographer Alexander Vasukovich and Katsiaryna Andreyeva, a reporter with the independent Belsat TV channel. On Friday night, Dominic Raab condemned the attack on press freedom. The British foreign secretary tweeted: \u201cI condemn the mass detention of over 50 journalists last night in Belarus, including from BBC, local &amp; international media. This was a blatant attempt to interfere with objective &amp; honest reporting. The Belarusian authorities must stop targeting journalists &amp; defend media freedom.\u201d Lukashenko appears determined to regain the initiative after two weeks of unprecedented street rallies against his rule in the capital, Minsk, and in smaller towns and cities. The protests follow his \u201cvictory\u201d in Belarus\u2019s presidential election on 9 August, which the opposition and EU say was rigged. On Friday EU foreign ministers meeting in Berlin agreed to sanction up to 20 senior Belarusian officials. They were targeted for their role in what the EU says were \u201cfraudulent elections\u201d and the subsequent crackdown. The individuals have not yet been named and the list is expected to grow. It is understood Lukashenko was not on the list. Some EU states wanted to go further. Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister Linas Linkevi\u010dius, who has been leading the charge for a tough response, said 15-20 names was \u201cdefinitely not sufficient\u201d and \u201cnot a serious reaction\u201d. Lithuania had tabled its own list of 118 officials. Those put on the sanctions list on Friday face EU travel bans and will see their assets in EU banks frozen. Earlier Lukashenko accused Nato of having aggressive designs on Belarus. He claimed the western military alliance wanted to topple his government and replace it with one that would invite in foreign troops. Lukashenko said the west wanted to intervene so it could sell its products. Nato denies the claims. This week, Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Lukashenko was trying to conjure up the image of outside forces threatening Belarus as an excuse for his crackdown on the opposition, during which police have beaten up hundreds of protesters. Further protests have been organised for this weekend. They include a \u201cgrand solidarity\u201d march by women on Saturday and a peace and independence protest on Sunday in Independence Square in Minsk. It is unclear if the security forces will try to arrest those who take part, but the detention of journalists is an ominous sign. Barys Goretsky, of the Belarus association of journalists, said his members intended to carry on reporting, despite intimidation from the authorities and the threat of imprisonment. \u201cOur readers are very active. They are demanding information. Our colleagues will continue to work,\u201d he told the Guardian. Goretsky said some of the journalists who had been detained had had their phones and camera equipment confiscated and not returned. The journalists would make a formal protest next week, he said. He added that the mood among citizens was upbeat, with protests continuing among different groups, including doctors who staged a walkout on Thursday. The Belarusian foreign ministry declined to issue accreditation to the majority of foreign journalists who applied for it, after Lukashenko railed against foreign coverage of the country in the run-up to the election. As a result, some foreign journalists entered the country without the official accreditation, posing as tourists. More than a dozen foreign journalists have been stopped at Minsk airport in the past two weeks and denied entry. Hansen \u2013 who works for the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter \u2013 described the arrest of media representatives inside Belarus as \u201coutrageous\u201d. In a tweet, he thanked Sweden\u2019s ambassador, Christina Johannesson, who picked him up after his release in her official Volvo. Another journalist, Franak Via\u010dorka, said riot police had forced reporters to delete photos because they were afraid of appearing in the \u201cBlack Book of Belarus\u201d. The book is an online record of alleged abuses carried out by members of Lukashenko\u2019s security services, kept with a view to future prosecutions. Via\u010dorka tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous. Journalists in Belarus are shot with weapons, deported, thrown into prison, raided in hotels, their cameras smashed, flash drives taken away. On state TV, independent journalists are threatened. Journalists are treated like dangerous criminals. But they are heroes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
