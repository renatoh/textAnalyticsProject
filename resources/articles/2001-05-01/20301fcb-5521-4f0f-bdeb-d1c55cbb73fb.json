With the availablity of information on the internet, will he just find out anyway? Is not better to just tell him up-front? The solution There are two schools of thought on this common dilemma. Some think honesty is the best policy since, as you point out, your boss may well get wind of your job-seeking activities anyway. Better to be up-front than risk appearing underhand. And, if they know, you can safely put them down as a referee, which you cannot if they are to be kept in the dark. It is also true that most employers would rather know if their employees are job-hunting - it can sometimes give them a chance to negotiate the means to encourage you to stay. Certainly, it can put you in a strong negotiating position - if your boss wants you to stay, that is. On the other hand, many bosses will interpret a desire to leave as reflecting a reduced commitment to your current post. They may start to give longer-term projects or even the more prestigious work to your colleagues, or plan for your leaving - before you have even got shortlisted elsewhere. And, suppose they know that you have interviews and that you are not successful? This can lower their opinion of you and put you in a weak negotiating position if you want a rise or promotion (since they think that no one else will have you.) So, to tell or not to tell? I think it depends on your reason for wanting to leave. Reasons to tell might include: if you want to leave for domestic reasons (you are moving to another town etc), because you have been with the present company for a long time and feel ready for a change, or you have agreed with your boss that you cannot get the skills or training (or indeed, financial remuneration) in the present company that you need. Reasons where it might be wiser to keep quiet include: if you have a personality clash with your boss and know that they are likely to make life difficult once they know of your plans; if you have only been in post a short while; or where your leaving would leave people or projects in the lurch, especially if you do not intend to give much notice. \u0095Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).
