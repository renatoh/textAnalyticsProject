The latest data on politicians\u2019 expense claims, released on Tuesday, shows Anning billed taxpayers for a $1,296.73 flight from Brisbane to Melbourne on 16 March, and another $1,296.73 to return the same day. The day prior, Anning had issued a widely condemned statement that sought to shift blame on the Christchurch attack, in which 51 Muslim worshippers were shot dead, on to Islam. Anning was in Melbourne for a party event, which he used to defend and double-down on his comments. He was struck on the back of the head with an egg by a 17-year-old who became known as \u201cegg boy\u201d. The cost of Anning\u2019s flights aligns with the price of business-class flights between Melbourne and Brisbane. He also claimed $305 for two Comcar trips in Melbourne on 16 March. The travel claims are within the rules. Anning has frequently billed taxpayers for business-class flights to controversial events. Earlier this year, he billed taxpayers a further $2,600 to travel to St Kilda for a rally of the far right, where some attendees were seen delivering Nazi salutes. The rally was organised by Blair Cottrell, who has been convicted of inciting contempt for Muslims. He also charged taxpayers for flights, accomodation and Comcar costs during a trip to join Canadian far-right figure Lauren Southern at a Sydney rally, where they protested the treatment of white South African farmers. Attempts to contact Anning were unsuccessful. The senator fell well short of re-election in May. His party received 37,184 first preference votes in Queensland.

It also shows the environment minister, Melissa Price, claimed the most in domestic fares for the quarter, at $50,648.68. Price claimed significantly more than other Perth-based ministers, including Linda Reynolds, who claimed $26,601 for domestic fares. Price also claimed the fourth-largest amount in travel allowances, billing the taxpayer for $15,959. She was behind only water resources minister David Littleproud, who claimed $18,675 in travel allowances, agriculture minister Bridget McKenzie at $16,301, and deputy prime minister Michael McCormack at $15,983.00. McKenzie claimed the largest amount of travel allowances in 2018."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
