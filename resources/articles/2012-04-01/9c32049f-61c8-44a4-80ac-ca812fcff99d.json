Late Night Gimp Fight may not be the most consistent act out there, but at their best they're capable of gaspingly effective comedy zingers that outstrip any of their peers. The Crystal Maze skit, the glow-in-the-dark acrobatics, the Ku Klux Klan skit \u2013 they've got the wonderful capacity to come up with constant laughs, and to keep you talking about them later. Unlike many young sketch groups, they don't devote a lot of time to establishing themselves as individuals, but as an ensemble they're so much more. With inbuilt youth appeal courtesy of the ceaseless filth that makes up much of their material, it would be amazing if they don't end up on telly. Bright stars indeed. Soho Theatre, W1, Thu to 5 May The Gentlemen Of Leisure, London The antithesis of the beery, high-energy Gimp Fight, Tom Neenan and Nish Kumar offer a more refined and traditional take on sketch comedy. With clear influences from Python, Cook and Moore, and Fry and Laurie, they've got the skills and imagination to transcend their inspirations and offer something entirely fresh and new. You won't find them doing sketches about going out on the lash and getting stoned \u2013 instead, they're more likely to offer stuff about English literature and obscure history. Their articulate and gently highbrow approach perhaps attains its perfect expression this week, as the foppish duo escort visitors on tours around the British Museum. Don't expect to learn amazing new things about one of London's most iconic buildings, but bank on being entertained by two impressive budding talents. British Museum, WC1, Fri Matt Forde, Belfast For the very most part, alternative comedy has always been reliably leftwing. And not just leftwing, but very leftwing. You can still see it today, not just in the work of evergreen activist comics such as Mark Steel, Mark Thomas and Jeremy Hardy, but also among the younger generation. Great newer talents like Josie Long and Joe Wells are doing their bit to rubbish the Tories. Try as you might, you'll find it hard to spot many stand-ups singing the praises of Dave and George or coming out with hilarious routines supporting the demolition of the NHS. Matt Forde doesn't go anywhere near that far, but he's certainly an anomaly on the circuit \u2013 a fervent New Labourite who is (despite everything) happy to sing the praises of Tony Blair and ready to admit that, like Peter Mandelson, he is intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich. He's certainly a performer who'll ruffle the feathers of the right-on, but he mixes it up with a generous helping of light, blokey charm that sugars the political stuff.
