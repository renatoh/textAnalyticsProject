Grundig is constructed using composite materials and so when her bow began delaminating her owner-skipper Sean Langman had no choice but to issue an \"all ships call\" - a request to any boats in the vicinity to prepare to stand by - and become one of 13 of the 75 race entrants to give up. Having survived the spectacular tornado that threatened to lift the then race leader Nicorette clean out of the water on the first day, Grundig was yesterday taking water as a result of the pounding she had taken while beating to windward into the waves. Langman, reporting a \"major problem\" as he announced his intention to turn round and make the 120 miles to Eden with the 35-knot south-wester lies more or less at his back, said: \"We have cut up the bunks to shore up the bows and have stemmed the water inflow with bunk cushions.\" The earlier safety-regulation disqualification of Tyco, when a close-up third, for failing to announce her passage into Bass Strait seemed cruel but inevitable given that Langman reported that Grundig had been launching herself off the backs of the bigger waves. With an estimated 36 hours to go to the finish in Tasmania, the Australian entrant News Corp was narrowly leading a group of four Volvo 60 around-the-world racers. But the day's sailing headlines were hogged by the gutsy comeback of the pre-race favourite Nicorette, which moved up to seventh as terrifying details emerged of the freak wind and hailstorm that left last year's winner on her side. \"It was the biggest, most awesome and awful experience I've ever felt,\" said the Swedish maxi's skipper Ludde Ingvall. Video footage taken on board Nicorette showed a huge, grey, funnel-shaped cloud moving across the ocean towards his boat, preceded by a piercing howl of wind. Ingvall sent all but three of his 23 crew below before the tornado hit the boat, knocking her flat and sucking her into its centre before spitting her out the other side. \"I felt it was like a wrestler grabbing the back of my jacket and trying to lift me off my feet,\" he said. His words were echoed by Grant Wharington, skipper of the Australian entrant Skandia, last year's runner-up, who retired after a buffeting from a tornado which he estimated was 500 yards in diameter at its base. \"We were expecting to see cows and motor homes and everything in it. It was really quite scary - I've never seen anything like it,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
