I'll round up briefly. Kevin Rose from Digg.com came on to tell everyone a little bit about what he's learned over the past couple of years. Things are fast; things are open; people try to game the site. One story - Donald Rumsfeld's resignation - went from hitting the front of Associated Press to the front page of Digg in seven minutes. Of course, however fast it got to the front of Digg, it still hit the AP first. They are opening the API to people so they can create flash skins for following the stream of stories and they're looking at ways of the \"prescient users\" (some might call them \"editors\") in order to improve the service. Google's woman with words, Marissa Meyer came on to tell us \"a secret that Google's learned\". She starts by explaining that a test which increased the number of search results threefold on Google's homepage - ie to 30 results - resulted in a 20% drop in searches. She says the lesson - which Google is now implementing across lots of other services - is that speed counts. Serving 30 results took twice as long, a whopping 0.9 seconds. People learn through iteration, and speed allows more iterations. I wondered if they couldn't take away a different message (though the data isn't there to confirm it, maybe if Marissa hangs around I can buttonhole her and find out more) - does it just mean that the search can be solved more easily by showing more results? Are they just finding what they want and not needing to iterate? Of course Google doesn't like losing 20% of searches, but maybe if users are finding the answer to what they want more easily that's why they're searching less - not speed. Finally, a longer discussion between EMI's David Munns and the masher-upper of A Night At The Hip-Hopera, Eric Kleptone. The subject, really, is how do record labels and artists deal with mash-ups and remixes - which are happening increasingly online. Record labels want to control it but can't, some artists like them while some don't. The subject turns, in a roundabout way, to Creative Commons. I'm no lover of the worst excesses of the music industry, But there's something I've never quite heard a satisfactory answer to (and which I've asked before on this blog). If I choose a CC license which allows people to remix for non-commercial purposes - or even commercial purposes - that's great. But surely that also gives me the right to have my creation NOT remixed (all rights reserved, which is one of the CC options). In the case of Dangermouse and his famous Beatles-Jay-Z mashup The Grey Album, the Beatles said they reserved the right to stop the remix. They probably wouldn't change that even if Creative Commons was enshrined in law... so why does everyone always have a sharp intake of breath? Anyway, the ultimate response - and Munns looks a bit uncomfortable - is that the record industry needs to come up with ways to licence content so that rights holders can be compensated. But nobody quite knows how to do it - a subscription database of mashable content? Lines in every artists' contract? Let's see. Oooh, I'm in a cynical mood this afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
