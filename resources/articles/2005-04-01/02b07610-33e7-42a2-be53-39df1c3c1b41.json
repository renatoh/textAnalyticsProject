Jose Mourinho's players believe they gained more from the stalemate, confident they can get an away goal and reach the Champions League final. Chelsea are buoyed by their 1-0 Premiership win at Anfield in January and know that if they score once on Tuesday, Liverpool will have to find the net twice. Petr Cech has been beaten five times in his past two away games in Europe - conceding two in Barcelona and three at Bayern Munich - but was upbeat. \"It's a better result for us than for them,\" the goalkeeper said. \"They played away and didn't score a goal. We just need to score one at Anfield and we know we can do that because we've already won there this season.\" Chelsea expect a more open game next week. \"We will have more space at Anfield,\" Didier Drogba said. \"Liverpool defended very well but at Liverpool we will have more chances to score. It will be a tight game but this time they will have to go for it, because they have to score if they want to go through.\" Meanwhile Liverpool's chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League as holders should they win the competition appear slim after it emerged that the majority of members on the FA's Professional Game Board would back the entry of the club finishing fourth in the Premiership, currently Everton. The FA board met last night to discuss what would happen should Liverpool reach the final and finish outside the top four. In that event the issue would be referred to the PGB board - made up of Phil Gartside, David Sheepshanks, Dave Richards, Rupert Lowe, Peter Heard and David Dein. While no decision needs to be made until the outcome of the semi-final is clear, the PGB board are understood to be intent upon defending the integrity of their own domestic competition, namely the Premier League, rather than those run by Uefa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
