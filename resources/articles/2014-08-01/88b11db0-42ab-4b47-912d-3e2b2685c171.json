During the competition, the team uploaded a picture of themselves at the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony to Facebook, and controversy ensued. \u201cTeam South Africa wearing Palestinian badges and Keffiyehs to show our opposition to the human rights violations carried out against the people of Palestine,\u201d they posted. The debating team\u2019s captain, Joshua Broomberg, is the deputy head boy of a prestigious Jewish school in Johannesburg. That sent the online commenters into apoplexy. Threats of violence were made against the students. Although South Africa has long had a strongly pro-Israel Jewish community, despite the African National Congress government increasingly opposing Israeli militarism and occupation, there are growing splits within the tight, Zionist enclave. Over 500 prominent Jews signed a statement a few weeks ago that read: Just as we resist antisemitism, we refuse to dehumanise Palestinians in order to make their deaths lighter on our collective conscience. We sign this statement in order to affirm their humanity and our own. We distance ourselves from South African Jewish organizations whose blind support for Israel\u2019s disproportionate actions moves us further from a just resolution to the conflict. In the global Jewish diaspora, dissent against Israel of this magnitude is a relatively new phenomenon. Although support for the Jewish state has been an unofficial second religion for Jews for decades \u2013 in my own family it was simply expected that Israel would be uncritically backed in times of war and peace, with Palestinians demonised as unreasonable and violent \u2013 times are changing. This doesn\u2019t please some of the loudest Jewish voices. Conservative writer Shmuel Rosner argued in the New York Times in early August that liberal critics of Israel were severing familial ties. \u201cIf all Jews are a family\u201d, he wrote, \u201cit would be natural for Israelis to expect the unconditional love of their non-Israeli Jewish kin.\u201d \u201cIf Jews aren\u2019t a family,\u201d he continued, \u201cand their support can be withdrawn, then Israelis have no reason to pay special attention to the complaints of non-Israeli Jews.\u201d Rosner believes that Israel will survive without liberal Jewish backing but surely even he recognises that Israel isn\u2019t an island, and without strong support from America \u2013 diplomatically, financially and militarily \u2013 the Jewish state is isolated and increasingly alone. Rosner knows that Jewish diaspora support for Israel is vital if the Jewish state is to perpetuate its nearly 50-year occupation of Palestinian lands. The standard tools used to silence skeptical Jews, including those in the diaspora \u2013 false allegations of self-hatred and antisemitism, accusations of backing Hamas - are less effective today. Israel can\u2019t rely on diaspora support while hardline Zionists criticise diaspora Jewish voices for an apparently insufficient knowledge of Israeli politics or Hebrew, either. In reality, despite what Israel supporters claim, the conflict isn\u2019t complicated; occupation never is. Critics have been stripped of their power by the sheer scale of the Israeli invasion in Gaza, and the searing images of death and destruction, which are forcing even the most dedicated Israel backers to question the tactic of collective punishment. In the US, Israel\u2019s chief backer, support for Israel is flagging. The numbers don\u2019t lie; a recent Gallup poll in the US found that Democrat voters and youth were much less likely to endorse Israel\u2019s actions than the general US population, and a key sample of congressional staffers agreed that \u201cIsrael attacked Gaza in a wild overreaction\u201d. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee understands the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of progressive support for Israel in the diaspora. Funding for young Jews to embrace Israel has been ramped up and \u201cbirthright\u201d trips are still ongoing, despite the conflict. But as one Rabbi noted, \u201cThis is a hard time to go and make that deep connection that we seek to make [on trips to Israel] ... you are not going to see the Israel I saw when I was there in June. It really is different. It changed overnight\u201d. Even the free trips are losing their effectiveness, and little wonder: a recent video, filmed at the Western Wall, shows how some young Israelis consider \u201canother war, and another war, and another war\u201d in Gaza to be normal. The Jewish diaspora has long been relied upon to endorse and fund Israeli actions. Zionist leaders from my home country, Australia, are this month welcoming one of the most senior members of the Israeli government: Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister, who advocates the total separation of Palestinians and Jews inside Israel, and wants \u201cloyalty oaths\u201d for Arab-Israeli citizens. The visit is already being hailed as \u201ca wonderful reflection of the standing of the Australian Jewish community within the leadership of the Israeli government.\u201d The feeling is mutual. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, wrote a letter to diaspora Jews this month thanking them for \u201cstanding by Israel\u201d: The support of Jewish communities around the world has been a source of great strength for the people of Israel \u2026 Many of you have had to face aggressive protesters, and even violent antisemitism \u2026 Israel will, for its part, continue standing at your side, as you deal with hatred and intolerance. Jews everywhere should be able to live with pride, not fear. I have great faith in the Jewish people and in the justice of our cause. While Israel doesn\u2019t attract the same degree of support, some blind, it once enjoyed, the extent of dissent shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated. Netanyahu\u2019s message is still overwhelmingly appreciated by the majority of active Jews worldwide. Orthodox and Liberal around the world embrace Israel in their own, often deeply reactionary way \u2013 as do plenty of evangelical Christians. Even some self-described progressive Jews, like the US writer Peter Beinart, still identify as Zionist. They do so to stay connected to family, friends and community. Were they to oppose Israel they would become outsiders. After all, since Israel\u2019s establishment in 1948, and more so since the 1967 Six Day War, communal organisations have been deeply involved in providing the intellectual, emotional and financial backing for the Jewish state. Who knows how many more Israeli massacres it will take to wean Jews in the diaspora off the Zionist cultural drip-feed? There\u2019s a feeling of belonging, a prestige associated with the Zionist world that makes many Jews feel complete. Losing that means cutting ties with the modern, Jewish ritual of devotion to a foreign country. It\u2019s perhaps hard for an outsider to understand this. Nevertheless, groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace in America are giving strength to an independent view. While acknowledging the worrying signs of real antisemitism emerging around the world, they argue, as Israeli journalist Amira Hass does, that \u201cIf the security of Jews in the Middle East were of real interest ... [the west] would not continue subsidising the Israeli occupation\u201d. Even the prominent Zionist Leon Wieseltier, writing in New Republic, is signalling the surging disquiet. \u201cI have been surprised by the magnitude of the indifference in the Jewish world to the human costs of Israel\u2019s defense against the missiles and the tunnels,\u201d he argued recently. A \u201cJewish Bloc against Zionism\u201d marched in the massive protests in London against the Gaza massacre, joining unprecedented outrage from Britain\u2019s political leadership over Israeli behaviour. Jews protested in New York and across America against Israeli actions. Diaspora Jews should acknowledge the risks that arise from conflating antisemitism with anti-Zionism, a legitimate difference with historical roots. They are increasingly feeling targeted for uncritically backing Israel, and perhaps have the most to lose if this distinction is not made. The alternatives are bleak: a split among Jewish communities along generational lines, or growing disillusionment of the Jewish population. French Jews are moving to Israel in ever-growing numbers, but few Jews feel safer in Israel than in their own nations. What threatens the Zionist establishment is not antisemitism or migration, but boycotts. A spokesperson for Britain\u2019s Community Security Trust, a group that monitors antisemitism, recently said that the community would \u201cget through\u201d a spike in Jew hatred \u2013 \u201cbut the boycott stuff is really, really serious\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
