The tie means Txiki Begiristain, City's director of football, and the chief executive, Ferran Soriano, will face their former club for the first time since leaving. Soriano was at Bar\u00e7a for five years before his resignation in 2008, having been one of several directors to offer a vote of no confidence in Joan Laporta, the then president. Begiristain departed in 2010 when Laporta did. The opening leg against the four-times European Cup winners is at the Etihad Stadium, where City are in rampant form, on 18 February. The return at the Camp Nou is on 12 March. \"I think they will be very concerned,\" Pellegrini said. \"Not only because we beat Bayern Munich. They know Manchester City is a strong team and it will be difficult for them. Barcelona is not the team it was two years ago. We will see how they arrive in February.\" Asked why are they are not the same side, the City manager said: \"I don't know exactly what happened inside Barcelona. They changed three managers in the last three years, maybe the performances of the players are not the same, maybe the players are older. There are a lot of reasons why teams change their performance. They continue to be a very good team. Two years ago they were more unbeatable than today.\" Lionel Messi, the four-times world player of the year, holds no fears for Pellegrini. \"It's not impossible but difficult. Last year, Messi played against Bayern Munich and they lost that,\" he said of the German side's 7-0 trouncing of Barcelona in the semi-final. City have become an imperious force at the Etihad, with Saturday's 6-3 humiliation of Arsenal there following a 4-1 victory over United, a 6-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, the 7-0 rout of Norwich City and the 4-0 defeat of Newcastle United. Pellegrini would not be drawn on whether the record will scare Barcelona. \"I suppose they know about that but you can't always expect to score five, six, seven goals at home,\" he said. Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino, Pellegrini's opposite number, insisted that City would not have wanted to meet his side. \"I imagine that they won't be happy to have got Barcelona, either,\" he said. \"The most important thing is to be in good shape when we get to February. Sometimes, the team you get is one team in December and another one by February. The team is the same but they can be in different form.\" Pellegrini has had success in the competition when at Villarreal and M\u00e1laga, reaching a semi-final and two quarter-finals. He can also point to success in La Liga, winning at the Camp Nou. \"With Villarreal we won there. I finished second after Barcelona one season in Spain.\" Begiristain said: \"I would have preferred a different opponent but I am very happy to go back to Barcelona and see old friends again. They are both teams that play good football so a spectacle is guaranteed.\" Pellegrini responded to the criticism he drew after his miscalculation of the match situation at Bayern. \"I recognised I made an error, a normal error because I repeat I thought we needed a three-goal difference,\" he said. \"But to have consequences in the future, I don't think there are any because we tried to scored a fourth goal.\" He denied that having to face Barcelona, an easier second-placed opponent, was actually a consequence. \"Not of not knowing,\" said Pellegrini. \"I made a mistake but we couldn't score four goals \u2013 its different. A mistake would be if we thought three goals was enough. If we tried to score five or four and couldn't do it, it's not a mistake.\" The injury suffered by Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who has 19 goals in 20 appearances, is a blow before the festive period. \"I think he will be at least one month out,\" Pellegrini said. The forward tweeted: \"It's confirmed \u2013 my calf injury will leave me out for at least a month. The good news is recovery work starts today! We started with therapeutic massages on the area and some bike work. I'll keep you posted. Thanks for the support!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
