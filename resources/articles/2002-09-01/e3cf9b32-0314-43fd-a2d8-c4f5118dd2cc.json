They completely outplayed Villa in the first half, and despite being under immense pressure for most of the second, still managed to score twice. Both goals came from catastrophic errors: the first from Enckelman in Villa's goal, the second was an Alpay balls-up. Final word has to go to Rob, a Birmingham fan on a sheep-station somewhere in Australia, I think: \"Thanks for an entertaining commentary cannot get live soccer here so can now go and kiss my favourite sheep.\" Whatever floats your boat Rob. Sorry, final word goes to referee David Elleray. He says he gave the freak goal because in his opinion, Enckelman touched the ball before it rolled over the line. If Staunton had thrown it straight into the net it wouldn't have counted. The video evidence would suggest Enckelman didn't actually touch it and the goal shouldn't have stood. Either way, it ain't good. 91 mins: Samuel shoots across the Villa goal and the ball goes out for a corner. Nowt comes of it. 90 mins: Enckelman makes another terrible mistake. The poor sod looks traumatised. He came out to attempt a clearance from Kinsella and completely miskicked. He got away with it, luckily. Somebody give him a brandy, for God's sake. I'll have one too, please. 87 mins: Birmingham substitution: Bryan Hughes for Robbie Savage Savage walks off to a well-deserved standing ovation. He's run his little socks off tonight. 83 mins: GOAL: Birmingham 3 - 0 Aston Villa Alpay tries to be clever in defence for Villa. He attempts to dribble the ball around Horsfield when he should be hoofing it clear, has the ball nicked from him and the substitute bears down on the goal and slots the ball home. 81 mins: Poor Enckelman. A fan ran onto the pitch after his howler and stood in front of him giving him the universally recognisable w***er sign. Most unedifying. It's probably a friend of Catheirne Simpson. If I was Enckelman I'd deck the goon. Then again, if I was Enckelman I wouldn't have conceded that goal in the first place. 76 mins: GOAL: Birmingham 2 - 0 Aston Villa Quite possibly the most comical goal I've ever seen. From deep inside his own half, Mellburg fired a throw-in to his own keeper, Enckelman. With nobody standing within a five-mile radius, he attempted to take a touch on the ball, either mis-controlled it or missed it completely, and then held his head in his hands as it rolled into the goal. Steve Staunton got booked for protesting afterwards - he claimed Enckelman didn't touch the ball (meaning the goal wouldn't stand). Referee David Elleray said otherwise. A total embarrassment. 75 mins: Gareth Barry belts in a free that goes narrowly wide. Villa are definitely in control now, which won't make Dave Lewis in France too happy: \"I left England in July for love. I'm now in Aix-en -Provence, France but tonight my heart is at St Andrews.\" 72 mins: There's a spot of afters between Dublin and Savage. The ref has a chat with them and they kiss and make up. Dion Dublin has the sweatiest head I've ever seen on any human being. Vassell has a near miss. There's pandemonium in the Birmingham box, Samuel dinks in a cross and Vassell heads it narrowly wide when he should really have scored. 71 mins: Enckelman takes a long punt, Dublin heads it down and Savage hoofs it back up the pitch. Ah, the beautiful game. 69 mins: Birmingham substitution: Horsfield for Morrison Samuel crosses for Dublin, who is crowded out and can't get a shot in. 65 mins: Cisse gets a yellow card for a rather over-enthusiastic tackle. Meanwhile, Morrison goes off for treatment. Chris Sullivan has mailed to say he's stuck in front of a computer in Los Angeles. Catherine Simpson, meanwhile, is in New York. She sent a very nice mail which included a profanity. Tut-tut! I said they were chanting \"sit on the Villa\", Catherine. She's a grad student \"writing a paper\", incidentally. Try to keep that clean, at least. 63 mins: The game has been transformed and Villa really have Birmingham under the cosh in this half. They win a corner from Stern John, which Kinsella swings in. Vaesen claims it well. 59 mins: Alpay, whjo has already been booked, fouls Damien Johnson, who goes down like a BBC commentator after broadcasting a tasteless metaphor. Alpay doesn't get a second yellow card, but Birmingham get a free. Grainger shoots from about 10 yards outside the box and brings a good save out of Enckelman, who tips it up and over the bar. Grainger wastes the corner. 56 mins: Darius Vassell has a goal disallowed. He's offside. A ball is crossed in, Grainger fails to control it and it falls to Vassell who slots it home. The linesman raised his flag late but it was the correct decision. On the sideline, does Graham Taylor not like that. He's going mental. David Elleray intervenes. 53 mins: Villa are turning the screw and Samuel, who obviously got a rocket up his backside at half-time is playing a blinder. He shoots into the side-netting. 52 mins: Kinsella moves forward for Villa and finds Mellburg. Who gives it away. 51 mins: Enckelman is down injured after a clash with Stern John. He gets treatment for a couple of minutes and is okay. 48 mins: My computer just crashed so now I'm on a different one. Unlike the heap of junk I have to work on, Villa have made a bright start to the second half. Gareth Barry missed a decent chance earlier, and now Samuel pushes forward and wins a corner. He had a reasonable shout for a penalty after being bundled over by Kenna. Now it's Vassell's turn to miss. Villa have created more chances in the last three minutes than they did in the entire first half. 46 mins: Mellburg threads a through-ball down the inside right of the Birmingham box to Kinsella. He's offside. 45 mins: Villa substitutions: Vassell and Dublin on for Allback and Angel. They can't possibly do any worse than the last pair, so why not throw them on. Angel and Allback didn't get a sniff of the ball in the first half. Birmingham kick off. It was a real blood and thunder first half. From Birmingham. Not much time to go through any e-mails, which is good because I haven't been sent any. Where is everybody? Am I the only person in the world stuck in front of a computer at this hour of the night? Half-time: Birmingham City 1 - 0 Aston Villa 44 mins: I'd love to know what Robbie Savage's mum puts in his sandwiches. He can just run and run and run and run. Which is about three \"and runs\" more than I could muster, even if I was being pursued by Aliou Cisse in bad form. Villa win a throw deep in their own half. Angel tussles with Cisse and almost kicks him in the face with a high foot. He's having a shocker. The ref plays advantage. 43 mins: Staunton is in possession in his own box and Savage sprints across to put him under pressure. Staunton casually dribbles round him and clears. That could have ended in tears. 42 mins: Corner for Birmingham. Grainger pulls it back to Savage, who is unmarked and in the exact same spot he was for the last corner. Devlin has a pop and it's blocked. 41 mins: Birmingham fanny around at the back a bit in an attempt to calm things down. 39 mins: Stern John bears down on goal and tries to take on Mellburg and Alpay when he should have passed wide to Devlin, who was haring into a good position. 38 mins: De la Cruz has a shot from distance that rebounds off the crossbar. Allback's attempt at a follow-up is almost as comical as it is feeble. Unlucky Villa. 36 mins: Samuel gets the ball out wide for Villa and pings it into the box. A game of pinball ensues before it's finally cleared. After half-an-hour, Villa finally seem to have realised there's a local derby going on. The Birmingham fans are singing a rather obscene song. Something about, erm, \"sitting\" on the Villa . . . 34 mins: Purse gets booked for a very clumsy studs-up lunge. Silly boy. 30 mins: GOAL: Birmingham 1 - 0 Aston Villa The bounce of the ball in the box fools Mellburg, he fluffs a clearance and Savage and Morrison are quickest to react. The ball ricochets off Robbie Savage in the penalty area and bounces into Morrison's path. He tucks it into the bottom right hand corner from about four yards, giving Enckelman absolutely no chance. 29 mins: Birmingham win a free outside the box on the left hand side. Devlin has a crack but doesn't get hold of it properly. It goes straight into the wall. 27 mins: Another good chance for Birmingham. Stern John crosses from the left. With the goalkeeper committed and Clinton Morrison waiting to pounce, Alpay hacks the ball clear. From the resulting corner, Robbie Savage shoots, unmarked, from the edge of the box. The ball takes a wicked deflection over the bar. 25 mins: Clinton Morrison is relieved of possession deep in Villa's half. Devlin wins it back, but Staunton finally emerges from a clatter of players and hoofs it straight to Birmingham's Kenny Cunningham. Alpay gets booked after hacking down Paul Devlin. 22 mins: Both teams are keeping a lot of bodies (not dead bodies, I hasten to add) behind the ball, but Birmingham are looking much more dangerous up front. Stern John and Clinton Morrison seem to be forging a potentially lethal partnership. Villa's strikers, Angel and Allback, look as if somebody should introduce them to each other. 21 mins: Birmingham win two corners in quick succession, but get nothing from either. Villa look very poor so far. 18 mins: Ronnie Johnsen bundles over Kenna just outside the Villa penalty area and concedes a free at the corner of the box. Grainger blasts it straight into Barry's face. Ouch! That has got to hurt. 16 mins: With defenders dropping off him, Stern John convereges on the Villa box and tries to find Morrison again. Staunton sticks out a toe and makes a crucial clearance. 15 mins: Kinsella misses a good opportunity for Villa, putting a header wide when he should at least have hit the target. 14 mins: Birmingham are definitely having the better of this one early doors. Morrison and Stern John are causing Villa no end of trouble at the back. Birmingham players are first to every ball. Morrison and Stern John link up well again and the Tooting-born Irishman misses a half-chance from a John cross from the right. 12 mins: Martin Grainger gets a yellow card for diving in with a challenge that can only be described as rash. Barry takes the resulting free for Villa and Grainger clears easily. 9 mins: Cisse misses a great opportunity to put Birmingham ahead. Morrison skinned Staunton for pace (doesn't everyone?) down the wing and finds Cisse with a superb cross. The Senegal captain has a shot from about seven yards and balloons it over the bar. 8 mins: The very hard and scary looking Aliou Cisse brings down Mark Kinsella with a late tackle that's more by accident than design. He escapes a booking. 7 mins: Birmingham go forward again. Stern John heads down to Clinton Morrison in the box, but the Irish international is offside. 3 min: Throw for Birmingham after Samuel slices a pass over the sideline. Birmingham's Devlin, the only local lad on the pitch, gets stuck in and tries to set up Stern John. Villa clear. 2 mins: Johnson attacks down the right for Birmingham, but Staunton relieves him of the ball. He passes to Kinsella, who makes a pig's ear of a pass to Barry. There's a whole lot of booing going on in St Andrews whenever an Aston Villa player gets the ball. Would the home fans preferred if they hadn't turned up? It'd be a debacle evening out at the football if they weren't there. 1 min: Villa kick off, and Allback immediately tries to make an opportunity for himself, which is cleared by Kenny Cunningham. Damien Johnson crosses from the left for Birmingham and Alpay heads clear. In the tunnel: As the players emerge, Steve Staunton has a word in referee David Elleray's shell-like. No doubt they were sharing a joke about the Irish international's days as a public schoolboy at Harrow-on-the-Hill, where Mr Elleray is a housemaster. Or not, as the case may be. I'd imagine Steve probably went to Dundalk Vocational School. If anyone happens to know where he was educated, please let me know. I'd also like to hear from anyone who's ever had a few pints with Manchester City's Richard Dunne. Mindless preamble If it's Telford v Scarborough you're after, you've come to the wrong place. Birmingham and Aston Villa's first Premier League derby will kick off amid an atmosphere of tension and, for the visitors, pure intimidation. The Villa players have been booed from all corners of the ground during the warm-up as a capacity crowd of nearly 30,000 revved up for the first top flight meeting between these bitter rivals for 16 years. The Blues have the powerful presence of Aliou Cisse back in the centre of midfield after the Senegal international missed the 2-2 draw with Liverpool due to injury. Villa are unchanged from their 2-0 midweek win over Charlton. The teams Birmingham: Vaesen, Kenna, Purse, Cunningham, Grainger, Devlin, Savage, Cisse, Damien Johnson, John, Morrison. Subs: Bennett, Horsfield, Hughes, Lazaridis, Powell. Aston Villa: Enckelman, Mellberg, Alpay, Staunton, De la Cruz, Kinsella, Johnsen, Barry, Samuel, Allback, Angel. Subs: Dublin, Vassell, Postma, Hendrie, Moore. Referee: D Elleray (Middlesex)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
