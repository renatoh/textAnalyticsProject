I know Sean Dyche well and they were a team who had one of the smaller budgets in the division, but did magnificently well. Everyone said Burnley worked hard and they were committed and no one spoke about their quality. The same goes for us.\u201d Russell Slade said: \u201cWe have to be more ruthless in both boxes. We need to be consistent and care for 90 minutes. I can only apologise to the fans for the first half.\u201d Ipswich 2-0 Middlesbrough Aitor Karanka slammed his players\u2019 attitude after a poor defeat to fellow promotion contenders Ipswich. \u201cThis is the first time I have been angry. After last week\u2019s win against Derby we thought we were a Champions League team. But today it is impossible to take anything from this. Ipswich wanted it more than us \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to understand.\u201d Mick McCarthy said: \u201cThe two real bits of quality came from us. Jay Tabb\u2019s goal was awesome \u2026 He could have left in the summer, but he said he wanted to stay and I am delighted he has. His attitude has been fantastic.\u201d And the rest \u2026 Steven Whittaker\u2019s late equaliser for Norwich in a 2-2 draw stopped Derby going top. \u25a0 Jordan Rhodes struck twice as Blackburn\u2019s 2-0 victory extended Charlton\u2019s winless run. \u25a0 Kit Symons\u2019s Fulham side cruised to a 4-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. \u25a0 David Cotterill\u2019s free-kick gave rejuvenated Birmingham a 1-0 win at Huddersfield. \u25a0 Rotherham earned their first win in 10 matches, 2-1 at fellow strugglers Wigan. \u25a0 Danny Batth hit a late equaliser as Wolves drew 1-1 with Brighton. \u25a0 And Nottingham Forest were held to a 1-1 draw by Leeds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
