His words delighted a crowd of more than 100,000 \u2013 many of whom had travelled to its modernist capital for the event, convinced the far-right populist can rescue their troubled country from virulent corruption, rising violent crime and economic doldrums. The former army captain and his wife Michelle waved to crowds from an open-topped Rolls-Royce before he and his vice-president, retired army general Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, were sworn in at congress. In a brief speech to the chamber of deputies, Bolsonaro thanked God for surviving from a near-fatal knife attack during the election campaign and invited lawmakers to help Brazil free itself from \u201ccorruption, criminality and economic irresponsibility and ideological submission\u201d. \u201cWe have a unique opportunity before us to reconstruct our country and rescue the hope of our compatriots,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to unite the people, rescue the family, respect religions and our Judeo-Christian tradition, combat gender ideology, conserving our values.\u201d He also referred to campaign promises such as freeing up gun possession. \u201cGood citizens deserve the means to defend themselves,\u201d he said. Bolsonaro said he was counting on congress support to provide \u201clegal support\u201d for police to do their work; he has promised impunity for police who kill criminals. \u201cThey deserve it and must be respected,\u201d he said. Bolsonaro has enjoyed the support of Brazil\u2019s powerful agribusiness sector, which he said will have an \u201cincrease in efficiency\u201d with \u201cless bureaucracy\u201d \u2013 words which will alarm environmentalists and indigenous activists concerned by his plans to streamline environmental licensing and allow commercial mining and farming on protected indigenous reserves. These fears seem justified, in one of his first acts as president, just hours after being sworn in, Bolsonaro took the power to identify and demarcate indigenous reserves from the National Indian Foundation (Funai), giving it to the ministry of agriculture, according to local media reports. He also took aim at the leftist Workers\u2019 party he has painted as communists responsible for all Brazil\u2019s ills, from crime to corruption. \u201cIrresponsibility conducted us to the worst ethical, moral and economic crisis in our history,\u201d he said. Minutes afterwards, Donald Trump tweeted that Bolsonaro had made a \u201cgreat inauguration speech\u201d, adding: \u201cThe U.S.A is with you!\u201d Shortly afterwards, Bolsonaro\u2019s Twitter account replied: \u201cDear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump, I truly appreciate your words of encouragement. Together, under God\u2019s protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people.\u201d Bolsonaro, a former army captain who served seven undistinguished terms as a member of Brazil\u2019s lower house, was until this year regarded as a marginal figure known for his outbursts against leftists and LGBT people. He rode a wave of righteous anger to power provoked by sweeping corruption scandals and economic recession that Bolsonaro blamed on the leftist Workers\u2019 party that ran Brazil for 13 years. In an aggressive and deeply polarised campaign that made adept use of social media, Bolsonaro focused attacks leftist former presidents Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 currently serving a prison sentence for graft \u2013 and his successor Dilma Rousseff, impeached in 2016 for breaking budget rules. Bolsonaro\u2019s election victory marks a dramatic swing to the right for Brazil, which from 1964 to 1985 was run by a military dictatorship that its new president has expressed support for. The inauguration took place under the tightest security seen in decades. Crowds of supporters passed through three checkpoints, including metal detectors. The new government said 115,000 people attended \u2013 many fewer than the half a million expected. As they sang and chanted, firemen sprayed some with water to alleviate the muggy heat. Many of the groups who travelled across country wore matching T-shirts and hats emblazoned with Bolsonaro\u2019s photo and name. About 80 bikers had come from Fortaleza in the north-east. \u201cHe is the man who will wake this country up, said Francisco Siqueira, 64, a retired army lieutenant who organised pro-Bolsonaro campaign parades of bikers. \u201cBrazilians will be proud when they travel abroad.\u201d Lawyer Eliana Rabello, 41, had flown from Colatina in Esp\u00edrito Santo state with 12 family members, including husband Marcelo, 42, a public servant and their daughter Mariana, 7 \u2013 all wearing Bolsonaro baseball caps. They had been campaigning for Bolsonaro from the beginning. \u201cWe saw he was the guy who was hope for Brazil,\u201d she said, playing down his extremist comments such as threatening a \u201ccleansing\u201d of leftists as \u201chot blood\u201d. But to deliver on his radical campaign promises and return Brazil to economic growth will require doing deals with the mercenary congress, analysts said \u2013 something he has sworn he will not do. Traditionally Brazilian presidents offer ministerial jobs to members of a coalition of parties in return for support \u2013 there are more than 30 parties in congress, none of which has a clear majority. \u201cThat\u2019s how the game is played,\u201d said David Fleischer, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Bras\u00edlia and a veteran observer of Brazilian politics. The system was blamed for corruption scandals in the leftist governments of Lula and Dilma Rousseff \u2013 and cleaning up Brazil\u2019s graft problem is one of Bolsonaro\u2019s central campaign promises. Instead of \u201cpork barrel\u201d dealing, he plans to lean on the support of cross-party, issue-based blocks in congress formed of lawmakers who are evangelical Christians or linked to agribusiness and the arms lobby. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to work,\u201d said Fleischer. If Bolsonaro wants to get an overhaul of Brazil\u2019s pension system through congress \u2013 something his predecessor Michel Temer failed to do \u2013 and reform financial markets regard as key to reducing a soaring deficit, Bolsonaro will need to bargain, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sit down and negotiate,\u201d he said. All that is yet to come. For now, Bolsonaro is riding a wave of enthusiasm from conservative Brazilians who identify with his promise to return their country to a traditional past. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pendulum,\u201d said Elias Figueira, 57, an Uber driver from Rio, \u201cfrom Marxism back to the right.\u201d In a poll published on Tuesday, 65% of Brazilians said they expected his government to be \u201cgood or great\u201d. In a second speech delivered from the presidential headquarters after receiving the presidential sash from outgoing president Temer, Bolsonaro said Brazilians could now \u201cdream of a better life\u201d. \u201cWe are going to re-establish order in this country,\u201d he said. He and Mour\u00e3o held up a Brazilian flag. \u201cIt will only turn red if our blood is needed to keep it green and yellow,\u201d he said. The crowds cheered, waved flags and celebrated the hope that Brazil \u2013 the perennial country of the future \u2013 might find its destiny by heading back into its past. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2013 to correct a mistranslation of the phrase \u201cgender ideology\u201d in Bolsonaro\u2019s speech to Brazil\u2019s chamber of deputies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
