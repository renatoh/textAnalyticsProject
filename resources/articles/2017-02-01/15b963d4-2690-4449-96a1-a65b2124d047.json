It's the economy, stupid", "bodyText": "It was an eagerly anticipated match, pitting a self-described feminist who has welcomed more than 40,000 Syrian refugees to his country against a president who once bragged about grabbing women and has sought to crack down on immigration. But anyone expecting Justin Trudeau to stand up to Donald Trump probably came away disappointed on Monday, as the Canadian prime minister met with the new president for the first time. \u201cThe last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,\u201d Trudeau told reporters at a joint press conference, after standing by as Trump gave an unapologetic defence of his controversial travel ban. Trudeau continued: \u201cMy role, our responsibility, is to continue to govern in a such a way that reflects Canadians\u2019 approach and be a positive example in the world.\u201d Although some might have longed for Trudeau to stake out the moral high ground \u2013 on Trump\u2019s travel ban, his casual misogyny or his bullying rhetoric against allies such as Mexico \u2013 Monday\u2019s meeting was always going to focus on cold economic realities. Since the inauguration, Canadian officials have taken every opportunity possible to point to the economic growth \u2013 and millions of jobs \u2013 which depend on cross-border trade. And in terms of cold realpolitik, the tactic seemed to have paid off: Trump praised the countries\u2019 economic ties and implicitly contrasted warm relations with Canada with the festering diplomatic crisis with Mexico. \u201cWe have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. We\u2019ll be tweaking it,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a much less severe situation than what\u2019s taking place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years the transaction was not fair to the United States.\u201d Since Trump\u2019s shock election victory, Trudeau has consistently refrained from directly criticising the president. \u201cIt is not the job of a Canadian prime minister to opine on the American electoral process,\u201d he told reporters last month when asked if he thought Trump was a misogynist. Analysts point to the Canadian economy to explain his reluctance to take aim at Trump; three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports go to the US and roughly 2.5 million Canadian jobs depend on American trade. Trudeau has instead relied on more subtle means to highlight the differences between Washington and Ottawa. Amid the chaos and uncertainty created by Trump\u2019s travel ban, Trudeau fired off a tweet highlighting that Canada stood ready to welcome those \u201cfleeing persecution, terror &amp; war...regardless of your faith\u201d Another tweet simply showed the prime minister greeting a Syrian refugee at the Toronto airport, with the hashtag #BienvenueAuCanada \u2013 welcome to Canada. Monday\u2019s visit also offered a jarring juxtaposition as Trudeau \u2013 whose gender- balanced cabinet made headlines around the world \u2013 joined forces with Trump to launch a council dedicated to improving opportunities for women in the workforce. While the idea originated from Trudeau\u2019s office, gender equality was portrayed as an area of mutual interest, despite the fact that Trump\u2019s has nominated just four women for senior administration positions. One of Trump\u2019s first orders banned international NGOs from providing abortion services or offering information about abortions if they receive US funding. \u201cI just want to say, Mr Prime Minister, that I\u2019m focused and you\u2019re focused on the important role women play in our economies,\u201d said Trump, who in 2005 told a reporter that he did not change diapers. \u201cWe must work to address the barriers faced by women and women entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets and very importantly access to networks,\u201d he added. Many observers pointed to other subtle shows of difference during Monday\u2019s visit. Much was made of the leaders\u2019 first handshake, in which Trudeau held his ground as Trump seemingly attempted to pull the prime minister towards him. Others pointed to Trudeau\u2019s use of French throughout the press conference; Trump is not known to speak any foreign languages. Trudeau also used the press conference to highlight the tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who have been brought to Canada in the past year or so without any compromise to the country\u2019s security. \u201cRelationship between neighbours are pretty complex,\u201d Trudeau noted at one point. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t always agree on everything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
