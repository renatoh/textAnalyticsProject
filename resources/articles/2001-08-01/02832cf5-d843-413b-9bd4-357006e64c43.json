Three second-half goals and a 6-1 aggregate win suggesting one side to be clearly superior to the other. Rangers' march into the next round of the Champions League only began to resemble a procession, however, once an equaliser had been netted and their confidence surged. Only when Neil McCann and Claudio Caniggia interlinked on the left to provide a perfect pass for Tore Andre Flo's sidefoot in the 55th minute could Rangers breathe more easily. Four minutes later it was all over as Caniggia scored the first of his two goals, each dispatched with brio, the first following good work on the right by Fernando Ricksen and new boy Stephen Hughes. Hughes, playing at right midfield, neither looked out of place nor overawed. Indeed, but for a flying, left-hand stop by goalkeeper Marko Simeunovic, in the 26th minute, an assured run onto a clever pass by Tore Andre Flo would have led to an impressive goal. After winning 3-0 in Slovenia last week, Rangers could have expected the second leg to be a relaxed stroll, in unflappable preparation for the more rigorous examination next week by Turkish club, Fenerbahce, who now await them as aggregate victors. The understandably lacklustre start took, however, an unexpected twist when the visitors rejected their anticipated fate by trying to make a game of it. It was hardly scintillating but it was enough for them to pull a goal back. The 17th-minute strike by Vanja Starcevic was indicative of how the contest was unfolding. A powerful run by Stipe Balajic said everything about Maribor's gung-ho attitude; Bert Konterman's clumsy attempt at tidying up was symptomatic of a worrying tendency towards looseness within the Rangers ranks. It was inevitable that Rangers would trouble the more than competent Maribor goalkeeper and Christian Nerlinger, before his early substitution, fired a ferocious shot just wide from 20 yards in the 22nd minute, while Russell Latapy launched along-range effort that rattled the bar in the 41st minute. Time and again, however, what ought to have been an unassailable advantage teetered on the brink of collapse because of a combination of Rangers' poor concentration and Maribor's refusal to buckle. With three minutes to go before the interval, at that point the only certainty was the dressing room dressing down Advocaat was no doubt slowly bringing to the boil. Rangers: Klos; Ricksen, Moore, Konterman, Vidmar, Hughes, Ferguson, Latapy, Nerlinger, Flo, Caniggia. NK Maribor: Simeunovic; Buksanovic, Balajic, Krizan, Snofl, Znuderl, Duro, Seslar, Filekovic, Kvas, Starcevic. Referee: J Monteiro (Portugal)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
