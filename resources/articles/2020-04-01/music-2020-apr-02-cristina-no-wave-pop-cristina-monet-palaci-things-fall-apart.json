The brainchild of Michel Esteban and Michael Zilkha \u2013 the Manhattan based, Oxford-educated son of the founder of Mothercare \u2013 it bridged New York\u2019s punk and disco scenes. Given how implacably opposed the two genres were (\u201cDeath to disco shit, long live rock!\u201d ran an editorial in the first issue of Punk magazine) it should have been a disaster, but ZE somehow made it work. They signed the cream of New York\u2019s supremely challenging post-punk no wave bands \u2013 Mars; Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, with their volatile singer Lydia Lunch \u2013 alongside disco producer Bob Blank. There was also August Darnell, the musician and producer behind one of disco\u2019s greatest albums, the eponymous debut by Dr Buzzard\u2019s Original Savannah Band, and Machine\u2019s extraordinary single There But for the Grace of God Go I, a rare example of disco in explicit protest-song mode. Zilkha encouraged no wave band the Contortions to record a disco album, Off-White, and attracted artists who thought along similar lines to him and Esteban: the Waitresses, Don and David Was, Lizzy Mercier Descloux. And then there was Cristina Monet-Palaci. Her recording career should have been a disaster \u2013 she was Zilkha\u2019s model-beautiful girlfriend and, by her own admission, her singing voice was \u201chopeless\u201d. But she was also extremely smart and a talented writer. Paired first with Darnell and then Don Was, she began turning out songs that felt like short stories: acidly funny, cynical, smart, occasionally moving. She turned her vocal limitations to her advantage, reciting her lyrics in a perfectly enunciated sprechgesang that fluctuated between blank-eyed and bored, breathily sexy and gleefully vicious. Her debut single, Disco Clone, had her duetting with a young Kevin Kline, the latter playing a dancefloor predator to Cristina\u2019s coquettish android. Called on to write a Christmas song for a seasonal ZE compilation \u2013 the original home to the Waitresses\u2019 Christmas Wrapping \u2013 she came up with the extraordinary Things Fall Apart, a series of reminiscences of disastrous Christmases past involving fatal illnesses, penury, broken relationships and loneliness. It may well be the starkest festive song ever recorded. She also developed a sideline in d\u00e9tourned cover versions. Her startling version of Leiber and Stoller\u2019s standard Is That All There Is? featured new lyrics of her own devising, in which the protagonist is revealed to be scarred by her mother\u2019s mental illness and winds up a co-dependent partner in an abusive relationship. \u201cI fell in love with the most wonderful boy in Manhattan,\u201d she drawled with relish. \u201cHe beat me black and blue and I loved it.\u201d It might well have been a hit had Leiber and Stoller not been so upset that they successfully sued to have the single withdrawn. Her eponymous debut album clearly bore Darnell\u2019s hand, both in the Latin American-inspired arrangements and the high camp, B-movie atmosphere. Its follow-up, Sleep It Off in 1984, was a brilliant collection of songs that shifted from Ballad of Immoral Earnings \u2013 originally written by Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill and others \u2013 to Don\u2019t Mutilate My Mink, which seemed to come from alternate musical universe where the Sex Pistols were fronted by Audrey Hepburn. She was particularly good at capturing one aspect of the demi-monde from which Ze had sprung, drawing sharp portraits of moneyed but dissolute women slumming it in New York\u2019s arty nightclubs that veered from satire to sympathy. Occasionally, she slipped into darker territory: the acoustic closer He Dines Out on Death depicted a man who uses his wife\u2019s suicide to social advantage. Even packaged in an ultra-hip sleeve designed by Jean-Paul Goude, this was strong stuff for the pop climate of 1984. \u201cNot for the MTV crowd,\u201d advised Rolling Stone in an otherwise glowing review. Cristina herself once protested that women in rock were expected to deal in \u201cwhiny poignancy or cutesiness or \u2018Fuck you, Jack!\u2019 in a leather jacket\u201d. The album flopped, and Cristina retired from music, in the mistaken belief that Zilkha, now her husband, had \u201cbought [her] a career\u201d. She moved to Texas to raise their family \u2013 \u201cI felt like the Madame Bovary of the freeway,\u201d she later said \u2013 before returning to her original vocation as a critic and contributing to the Times Literary Supplement. \u201cYou were always a brilliant writer,\u201d her mother remarked after witnessing one of Cristina\u2019s live performances, \u201chow could you be so self-destructive as to sing?\u201d But in her absence from music, the stock of her slender back catalogue grew, particularly with the early noughties interest in New York post-punk and the genre retroactively named disco-not-disco. Everything she had recorded was re-released in 2004 to glowing reviews: her oeuvre was perfectly of its time yet hadn\u2019t dated. Despite the renewed interest, she declined to make another album (\u201cI\u2019m an old trout\u201d) but was briefly lured back into the studio by New York producer Ursula 1000. On the resulting Urgent/Anxious, she sounded exactly as she had 20 years earlier: completely unlike anything else. Or as singer-songwriter Zola Jesus put it on hearing of her death: \u201cToo weird for the pop world, too pop for the weird world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
