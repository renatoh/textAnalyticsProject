Tomorrow she will be the centre of attention in Birmingham when she takes on the double Olympic champion Gail Devers of the US and Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas in the 60m at the Norwich Union Indoor Grand Prix. \"People recognise me more so I suppose my life has changed after what happened in Edmonton,\" she says. \"But it hasn't changed that much, should it have? \"You have to move on. I could spend all the time thinking about that race but it would have no effect on what I do now. It has come and it has gone, there is a big summer ahead and I want to go out there and race as well again.\" After disappointing at the Olympics in Sydney, the 29-year-old's preparation for the following summer was hardly out of the coaching manual. Her husband Mark Block took over coaching duties and she practised in the front room of their home in Tennessee. \"She was close to breaking furniture in the living room,\" says Block. It worked, and for the first time in 42 100m finals Jones had to settle for second. Her appearance will be one of the highlights in this third round of the Energizer Euro-Series where Russia's Svetlana Feofanova is aiming to break the pole vault world record for the fourth time in two weeks. Colin Jackson meets the world champion Allen Johnson in the 60m hurdles while in the 60m, Morne Nagel takes on the Britons Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
