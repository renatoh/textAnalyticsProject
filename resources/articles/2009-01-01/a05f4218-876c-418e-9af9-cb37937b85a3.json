As manager of the English, European and world champions, Ferguson is in a good position to comment, but he can also remember when the combination of Jose Mourinho's management and Roman Abramovich's financial backing made it look as though Chelsea's dominance would last for years. Why it has not happened is, according to Ferguson, a victory for United's more patient approach. \"Chelsea changed the face of the league and we knew we had to raise the bar,\" he said. \"But ours was a long-term view, with younger players, and that policy has worked. We felt we should build a team that would last for a long time. That required a bit of patience at the time but we knew that we couldn't match Chelsea in terms of spending power, so the sensible thing was to go that way and identify younger players who, in the long-term, would develop into top players. \"Chelsea were spending money a different way, but it didn't mean we had to go down the same road. We had to look at things a different way and I think we did it the right way in terms of what Manchester United is all about. This club has always been associated with great young players down the years, and we've tried to maintain that tradition. \"Plus the main difference between Chelsea and ourselves is that they've changed their management structure three times in recent seasons. The longevity I have gives me the ability to look at the bigger picture all the time. I can look and plan for three or four years ahead, whereas a manager coming into another club doesn't have that time.\" Ferguson confirmed that Rio Ferdinand would be fit to return against Chelsea on Sunday in a side that will also have Patrice Evra available again after suspension. Carlos Tevez, who is likely to revert to a substitute role, has endured a difficult week with his future the subject of intense scrutiny, but Ferguson's initial refusal to discuss the matter did lead to a clue that he still believed Tevez would stay. \"I'm fed up having to answer stupid questions about it,\" he said. \"Every week it's the same question. It's a private matter and when the player signs, we'll let you know.\" United are four points behind Chelsea and seven adrift of Liverpool but have games in hand against Wigan and Fulham. \"They are both at home and it's important we take advantage,\" said Ferguson. \"But the first thing is to win on Sunday. That's the one that can set us on our way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
