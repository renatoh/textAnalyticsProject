Agnelli unveiled the new logo, a stylised black and white letter J in the shape of a shield, at a ceremony in Milan, saying \u201cthis new logo is a symbol of the Juventus way of living.\u201d \u201cWe spent a year trying to find out what the new markets want, but also to show a sense of belonging and looking to the future,\u201d Agnelli added. The event was attended by a number of first-team regulars, including Leonardo Bonucci and Claudio Marchisio, while legendary Italian electronic musician Giorgio Moroder played at the event. \u201cI saw the future of music in the 1970s. Now, Juventus have seen the future of football,\u201d Moroder said. The launch of the new logo was supported by a promotional video, which appeared on Twitter with the slogan \u2018life is a matter of Black and White\u2019. Juventus\u2019 current logo features the silhouette of a charging bull, a symbol of the club\u2019s home city of Turin that also appears on the crest of local rivals Torino. The club has largely used a variation of this design since 1971, while their logo in the 1960s and 1980s featured a zebra. Juventus have played in black and white stripes since 1903, when Notts County famously sent the club a set of shirts to replace their original pink jerseys. Juventus have won the last five Serie A titles and currently lead the table by one point from Roma, despite a 2-1 defeat to Fiorentina on Sunday. In Monday\u2019s game, Milan fought back from 2-0 down at Torino, Andrea Bertolacci and a Carlos Bacca penalty earning a draw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
