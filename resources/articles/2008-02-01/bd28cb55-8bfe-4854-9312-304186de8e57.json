Who would have thought it could ever come to this? Vicente del Bosque, that's who. And he threw a couple of league titles and some attractive football into the mix as well. Anyway, here are those aforementioned Four Stages: 1. Initial upturn in performance, results and aesthetics 2. Godawful eye-bleeding dreck 3. Denial in the face of all evidence, usually with reference to possession stats and number of shots which were only a bit off target 4. Resigned acceptance that the jig is up. A Liverpool fan, in such a blistering funk he emailed in nearly five hours before kick-off, writes: \"In spite of all the evidence and my gradually declining sanity,\" begins Barrie Stevens, taking a deep breath, \"I am still supporting this pathetic bunch of t***s who couldn't even beat Barnsley (I mean for F***S sake). But I have to say I hope we get caned tonight. At least 3-0. It's the only way things are going to change for the better. I suspect Benitez will opt for 4-5-1 play-them-on-the-counter-and-hope-Torres-is-too-fast-for-them. I just hope Mancini has the stones to play offensively, maybe 4-4-2. I know its not the typically Italian way of doing things, but we have no answer for teams who play in this fashion. So here's to at least 3-0, Benitez sacked, the Yanks gone and a decent owner/management combination coming in to sort us out. Forza Inter!\" Do you want a paper bag to breathe into, Barry? A cool flannel for your forehead? Beta blockers? Kick off: 7.45pm, at which point doctors hope poor fevered Barrie has simmered down, just in case Liverpool's antics from 7.46pm onwards cause him to re-funk and fatally overheat. Manchester United v Liverpool v Manchester United v etc. and so on and so forth: \"As a Manchester United fan, tonight presents a strange dilemma,\" writes Phil Murphy. \"Part of me wants the torment of Benny to continue and conclude. To see them humiliated by the Forza would be delicious; a double helping of gooey Schadenfreude as they witlessly succumb, time finally ringing on the Spanish mediocrity and his feckless followers. But then a new chapter starts: a better manager: more money: real success with a decent team: the hateful arrogance of twenty years ago re-surfacing : THE POSSIBILITY OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE AT ANFIELD. AAAAGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! So what's a Manc to do? Enjoy and gorge on the vast and immediate pain, or pray for a little more drawn-out suffering that a win and renewed hope might bring El Beard? Am I a would-be executioner or torturer?\" Meanwhile Barrie has calmed down. \"Yoga is a wonderful thing,\" he lies. \"I'm interested to hear your take on things at Anfield. Since you seem to think Rafa is for the chop, who would be your preferred replacement?\" Why you're in any way interested in my opinion is beyond me, Barrie; I should refer you to the second paragraph of this report. Though since you're asking, and seeing the Reds need someone with the nous to antagonise and destabilise a nearby larger and richer arch-rival... hmm... well, Fidel Castro is available. He fits the profile, and he'd only be pottering around the flat otherwise. Which striker with the ability to run at speeds of up to 1mph will partner the returning Torres? Reina, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Aurelio, Gerrard, Mascherano, Lucas, Babel, Kuyt, Torres. Subs: Itandje, Riise, Benayoun, Alonso, Crouch, Pennant, Arbeloa. Eleven points clear in Serie A, are this lot: Julio Cesar, Maicon, Cordoba, Materazzi, Chivu, Zanetti, Stankovic, Cambiasso, Maxwell, Cruz, Ibrahimovic. Subs: Toldo, Figo, Vieira, Burdisso, Crespo, Maniche, Suazo. Man with whistle, rulebook, cards, pencil, officious attitude, etc.: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium) In the interests of balance, please welcome Gentleman Jim and his pro-Liverpool musings: \"In response to the Manc Phil Murphy,\" writes James Callaghan, \"as a Liverpool fan I hope Arsenal win the Premier League to [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] off Man U fans. I hope Chelsea win the League Cup to [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] off Man U fans. I hope Portsmouth win the FA Cup to [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] off Man U fans. And I hope Liverpool stuff Man U in the final of the Champions League to [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] of Man U fans and knock United off their [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] perch.\" The final of the Champions League? Given Liverpool are in the midst of an utterly wretched run of form, you display both remarkable reserves of optimism and the nose for a crisis of your 1970s prime-minister namesake. Measured analysis, like this is the website of a national newspaper or something: \"Liverpool are - as usual - over achieving in the Champions League and underachieving in everything else, a pattern that has survived for about five years now,\" types Owen Linderholm between beard strokes. \"To change it will require big money - not the kind where you have to borrow it all to start with - but the kind where you come with it in the bank and an aim to SPEND it. And even big money is no guarantee.\" Meanwhile Wendy Fictional writes: \"Oh Scott, I love it when you slope off to smoke your cigarettes, a mere 18 minutes before the match starts, meaning when you get back you're up against it before the game has even started.\" No problem, Wendy, we at The Website Formerly Known As Guardian Unlimited aim to please. Back in less time than it takes for Harry Kewell to drain a buttershake, promise. Never Mind Big Cup, Liverpool v Man U Rivalry Or Rafa's Impending P45 dept.: \"What we, the reading public, want to know, is who is going to win the final of Masterchef?\" wonders Mark O'Neil. \"I'm plumping for precociously talented 18-year-old Emily, who is displaying Michael Owen-like early form. Let's just hope that after she wins and announces her arrival in the world of pretentiously contrived cooking she doesn't follow the rest of his template by severing a tendon in her hand with a fish knife, before ending up a tragic shadow of her former self while flipping burgers in a Newcastle Little Chef.\" And we're off! It's five months since anyone beat Internazionale, and roughly the same time since Liverpool won a game. Oh alright, no it's not. But they need to get their gamefaces on tonight, something they haven't done since thrashing Portsmouth at home before Christmas. Superstitious Reds will be happy: Liverpool will be kicking towards the Kop in the second half. And the first couple of minutes look good for Liverpool, as they enjoy a sustained period of possession which only ends with a wasted free kick. 2 min: Never mind the wasted free kick; Gerrard does brilliantly to win the ball back and force a corner. From which the ball drops to Carragher ten yards out; the Liverpool vice-captain sidefoots an effort goalwards. It's blocked by Cordoba's hand, though a penalty would have been tough on Inter as the Inter man had his back to the ball as it hit him. A good start from Liverpool. 4 min: A really impressive start from Liverpool, this; Chivu is booked for dragging the marauding Gerrard down just outside the box to the right; Aurelio's free kick is half-decent, but always too high to bother the net. 6 min: Babel cuts inside from the left and feeds the ball to Torres, whose flick on is just a wee bit too high for Kuyt on the edge of the area. The Dutch striker gets a head to the ball but can't control it. This is a really positive start from Liverpool; could the Champions League kickstart a spluttering campaign? 7 min: Torres gets his head to a long ball and guides it back in the general direction of the advancing Lucas, but Materazzi does well to hack clear before the Brazilian can get his foot to the ball. 8 min: Now Torres powers brilliantly down the right and fires a low cross across the face of goal; it's hacked clear for a corner. From which Julio Cesar does well to tip a Hyypia header over the bar! This is very impressive from Liverpool. Inter can't get the ball at all. 11 min: All Inter are doing is lumping witless ball after witless ball in the general direction of Cruz and Ibrahimovic, neither of whom can get into the game. 12 min: Just brilliant from Torres, who hares after a Gerrard long ball down the right wing. He's miles behind former Everton defender Materazzi, but no matter; Torres simply tears past him, forcing the defender into an illegal shoulder barge for which he's booked. The free kick is wasted, but that's two of Inter's back four on a yellow already. This is like their start against Juventus back in 2005 - though no goal yet. \"You can stop trying to balance your coverage by having us convinced Liverpool are passing the ball well and creating chances,\" writes a suspicious Richard Whittall. \"No one's buying it, pal.\" You can't win these days. 16 min: The ball finally reaches Liverpool's final third. Sadly for Inter, none of their players do, and it bounces harmlessly out for a goal-kick. 19 min: Inter have at least managed to quell Liverpool's early fire; they're still not seeing much of the ball, but now the home side are passing it harmlessly around the middle of the park, rather than pressing forward. Still, a solid start. 21 min: Inter win a free kick 35 yards out on the left. Stankovic's delivery is appalling and sails into the heart of the Kop. Materazzi falls to his knees in the box under no pressure and claims a penalty, but come on. \"So why is it that Liverpool can only play well in Europe?\" asks Richard Wood. \"Is it really just because the fans make so much noise? And if so, is it their fault the team's not winning in the league?\" I'm not getting involved in this. 24 min: Babel sashays wonderfully down the left and cuts the ball back to Lucas, whose first time prod forward finds Gerrard. The Liverpool captain tries a first-time effort as well, but his attempt at a daisycutter wouldn't flatten a flower and trundles well wide. A neat passing move, though. Meanwhile, evidence that serial MBM contributor and former Dungeons &amp; Dragons gamer Gary Naylor spends far too much time alone in his bedroom mounts up, as he asks: \"Is it normal to think that Torres looks like Paris Hilton?\" 26 min: Cordoba hacks Torres down on the right touchline. The free kick is wasted. Still, Torres is getting plenty of joy down this right flank. 29 min: SECOND YELLOW CARD FOR FORMER EVERTON DEFENDER MARCO MATERAZZI!!! He picks up a stupid yellow card for pulling back Torres by the shoulder, and he's off! You don't usually get those given - and that decision was harsh - but then rules are rules so the Inter defender can have no complaints. \"Is there a parallel between Liverpool and the Irish rugby team?\" asks fan-of-both Ronan Hayes. No. \"Both look as though they should be good on paper before playing appallingly against weaker opposition. Then when their coach looks close to being fired, they deliver a performance that shows at least a little promise before ultimately losing anyway (Ireland v France, Liverpool probably in this tie). Still, here's hoping Ireland don't lose on Saturday to the Barnsley that is Scotland.\" 32 min: Babel finds himself free, left of goal, on the byline. He cuts the ball back across goal towards Torres, who attempts an overhead kick but is muscled out of the way at the last by Stankovic. Inter are rocking. This is on for Liverpool; can they take advantage? 34 min: There's a whole lotta aimless hoofin' goin' on. In Defence Of Rafa dept.: Imagine if Rafa was allowed to buy the players he wanted instead of second or third choices like Pennant, we would be walking the Champions League every year,\" opines Rowan Blades. \"Rafa is indeed, the king of Europe.\" 36 min: A couple of long-range one-twos between Babel and Aurelio and then Torres is so nearly sprung free in the box, but the striker's control is terrible and a chance to turn and hit a snapshot is gone. And now some referee-based satire. \"So much for Belgian neutrality,\" quips Art Durbano, so I don't have to. 39 min: Babel takes charge of a bouncing ball, cuts inside from the left and attempts a curler into the top-right corner; it's far too high and wide. Liverpool are bossing this, without having made as yet a clear-cut chance. 42 min: It's very quiet at Anfield. Nothing much going on at all. \"You've got to be having a laugh when you say Materazzi can have no complaints at being sent off,\" writes Simon Horwell. \"That is probably the softest red card I have ever seen. He hardly even touched Torres for the second one, who unsurprisingly went down faster than [PHRASE DELETED BY PICTURE-POSTCARD GAG EDITOR]. If this is what football has come to, then the future is indeed bleak.\" 44 min: Liverpool so nearly open the scoring as Gerrard bursts past Chivu down the right and squares a ball across the face of goal. Kuyt, reaching speeds of nearly 1mph, can't get to the ball and Maicon can hack artlessly clear. Half-time: Liverpool 0 - 0 Internazionale. Kuyt has a flay with his shin from just outside the box, Stankovic lumps an aimless long ball into Liverpool's area, the referee blows his whistle, and that's it for the half. \"Who the [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] is the swearing editor?\" asks Tristan Bray. \"I thought that the Guardian style guide said you 'are more liberal than any other newspaper, using words such as [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] and [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] that most of our competitors would not use'. Can you tell him or her to [WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR] off?\" Sadly the MBM Swearing Editor is no respecter of preconceived notions of style, Tristan; you should see his shirt, he looks like a right co[MAJORITY OF WORD DELETED BY SWEARING EDITOR]er. Not Caring If Materazzi's Dismissal Is Unfair Or Not dept.: \"It would be okay with me if Materazzi was sent off in every major match he participates in,\" writes someone called B Lo, who may or may not still be Billy from the Block. \"If not for the way he stained Zidane's legacy, then for the stupid who-me face he insults us with as he commits his fouls.\" Fair enough, but... staining Zidane's legacy? This the same Zizou who used to get himself sent off for murderous challenges every other match? And we're off again! No substitutions by either side. 47 min: A poor header from Hyypia eventually finds his way to Cambiasso, who tries to curl one into the top right corner with the outside of his right peg. It's a half-decent effort, and Inter's first serious attempt of the night. 49 min: Four minutes in and Liverpool have yet to start this half. Then suddenly Finnan breaks clear down the right and cuts a brilliant ball back which Chivu does well to hack clear for a corner. The set piece is taken quickly: Gerrard romps in from the right and unleashes a shot which hits Ibrahimovic on the top of the arm. There are claims for a penalty but even this referee isn't going to give that. 52 min: Not that Liverpool are running out of ideas or anything, but Hyypia takes the ball from the centre circle halfway into Inter's half and has a dig from 30-plus yards. Oh come on. 53 min: Good work from Torres down the left forces a corner off a dallying Maicon. The ball's worked right, then left again, then out of play. Liverpool are creating nothing. 54 min: Patrick Vieira comes on to boos for Cruz, whose last touch is a risible attempt to recreate Luis Garcia's wondergoal here against Juventus three years ago. No wonder he's going. 55 min: Finnan diddles Stankovic down the right on the byline and wins a free kick as the Inter player drags him back - but doesn't get booked. Inconsistent refereeing, well well. Aurelio, a supposed free kick expert who has yet to take a decent free kick for Liverpool, overhits the set piece out of play. That is not good. 57 min: What a save by Julio Cesar! Vieira's forward pass is charged down and bounces to the feet of Torres, who scoots clear of Maicon and Cordoba and attempts a powerful sidefoot into the bottom left corner; the Inter keeper fingertips round the post magnificently. 58 min: And now Hyypia heads a Kuyt right-wing cross over from six yards. Two minutes, two gilt-edged chances, no goals. Liverpool will have to take one of them soon. 60 min: That should have been a penalty to Liverpool: Gerrard pulls a ball back from the byline, only for the onrushing Vieira to parry it with a hand that moves decisively and deliberately. Lucky Inter (apart from the earlier red-card decision, obviously). Liverpool do have a corner as a result, but it's wasted. 63 min: Torres turns 30 yards out on a sixpence and whacks in a low shot which only just misses the bottom-left corner. A wonderful effort. Lucas makes way for Crouch. \"Didn't Liverpool also dominate the Barnsley game for, oh, about 92 minutes?\" wonders Daniel Barron. 66 min: Vieira looks well off the pace: now he allows the ball to clank of his shins, ceding possession to Crouch. As a result, Inter are pressed back in their final third for a couple of minutes. Nothing really comes of it. 68 min: Suddenly a period of hectic activity from Inter, as they roll forward and win a couple of corners in a row. They swing a few balls into the box, Hyypia having to slice the most dangerous one away from six yards out. Then Cambiasso nearly breaks through the centre, but he's flagged offside. 71 min: Time is beginning to run out for Liverpool. To this end, Pennant comes on for... Babel! One of Liverpool's best players. Why did he not get shot of Kuyt... who is now playing in Babel's position on the left wing? Oh Rafa! 73 min: Crouch should have done better there: he heads weakly forward but is presented with a golden opportunity to volley powerfully towards goal from the edge of the area, thanks to a terrible defensive header from Cordoba. However he swishes tentatively at the ball and it bounces apologetically wide left. 74 min: Burdisso comes on for Cordoba, who is either crocked or terminally embarrassed at that header a minute or so ago. Meanwhile I still can't understand replacing Babel on the left with Kuyt. Dirk Kuyt! Plus the fact Benayoun is still on the bench. 76 min: Kuyt hits a cross straight at Maicon. 77 min: I mean, Dirk Kuyt. 78 min: Crouch takes the ball down brilliantly with his chest, eight yards out, but Chivu does well to close him down before a shot can be taken, and the chance is gone. 80 min: Absolutely brilliant from Gerrard, who is upended outside the area. It should have been a free kick, but he doesn't get the decision - so, with two Inter defenders swarming around him, he scoops the ball between his legs, swivels round on his arse, and sends the ball right to Finnan. Nothing comes of the move, but that showed some determination. 82 min: Mascherano does wonderfully well to nick the ball off Vieira as Inter romped forward. Then he passes it straight out of play. \u00a318m! \"Any chance Rafa is trying to get sacked?\" asks Daniel Barron. \"I mean, all this griping from the fans and media and American owners must get old after a while.\" 84 min: GOAL!!! Liverpool 1 - 0 Internazionale. Superstitious Liverpool fans are going to thank me for tempting fate between 71 and 77 mins. Inter don't deal with a Pennant cross from the right. It bounces right across the face of the six-yard box to Kuyt, who chests down and sees his powerful shot deflected off Maicon's outstretched leg and past the wrongfooted Julio Cesar into the roof of the net. Anfield erupts. Rafa Benitez: tactical genius. \"I mean, Scott!!\" writes David Studer, never one to miss a trick. 88 min: Maicon has been down in the box for a couple of minutes. Rafa is tapping his watch under the fourth official's nose, Ferguson-style. 89 min: GOAL!!! Liverpool 2 - 0 Internazionale. What a goal! Pennant pulls the ball back to Gerrard from the right. The captain advances towards the right-hand corner of the box and threads an amazing shot right across goal into the bottom left corner via the post. Right in the bottom-left corner. Off the post! How on earth did it snake through? That wasn't about power, it was precision. 90 min +1: Vieira, who has been hopelessly off the pace, hacks down Aurelio and is lucky not to go into the book. This referee has been all over the place. \"Has anyone registered Kuytigol?\" asks David Studer. No, David, I think you can have that one. 90 min +3: There will be one minute more of this. A brilliant result (though Barrie Stevens isn't going to be happy)! Liverpool 2 - 0 Internazionale. That's it! You've got to give Liverpool a hell of a lot of credit for keeping on keeping on. They didn't look like scoring - none of them, least of all Dirk Kuyt - and then... and then. A calmly taken (if slightly fortunate) effort from Kuyt, then a simply amazing effort from Steven Gerrard. This is what is impossible to understand about Liverpool: how on earth can they lose to Barnsley, let two goals in against Havant &amp; Waterlooville, struggle against Luton Town and Derby County... then do this? No point asking me, I thought they were going to win the league this year. One word of warning though, this isn't over, as David Hindle and his Bumper Book of Football History notes: \"Somewhere in the 8,000 years of Anfield history was a Mr Bill Shankly, an away leg against Inter - and a referee whom it was later proven had his villa financed by the Italians. Result: 3-0 to Inter in the fog. History repeat itself? Never!\" Email: scott.murray@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
