What is body neutrality, I hear you say? It\u2019s apparently something that Jameela Jamil came up with, and Taylor Swift is ever so thankful to her for it. Talking to the DJ Zane Lowe in a recent interview, Swift spoke about the times she was slut-shamed as an aspiring artist, and how her talent was overlooked because she is a woman. Then she praised Jamil: \u201cWe have amazing women out there like Jameela Jamil saying, \u2018I\u2019m not trying to spread body positivity. I\u2019m trying to spread body neutrality where I can sit here and not think about what my body is looking like.\u2019\u201d I know what you\u2019re thinking: how are you supposed to keep up? We\u2019ve had body negativity for centuries, then body positivity suddenly came along, and now this? Cast your worries aside \u2013 here\u2019s all you need to know. What is body neutrality? So whatever body neutrality is, it is not body positivity. Body positivity is old news. Body positivity was the move to encourage women to celebrate their bodies. People interpreted this message in mixed ways. Some thought it meant celebrating your body by not wearing many clothes, in an \u201cif you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it\u201d kind of way. But many people pointed out this was not very inclusive to people who do not have conventionally beautiful bodies. Others interpreted it to mean women should be encouraged to celebrate their bodies no matter what they look like. But then people got annoyed that this message was excluding conventionally good-looking people, who are, like, never included in anything. Then people started to think body positivity was just a marketing sham being used to sell women more stuff. Body neutrality is, of course, much more nuanced than all of this. It is the idea that women\u2019s bodies should just not be commented on at all. So don\u2019t say: \u201cI love how I look, no matter what you think.\u201d But do say: \u201cI love what I think, and who cares what I look like?\u201d And Jameela Jamil came up with it? Well, not exactly. The phrase has been used since around 2015 and was popularized when the fitness coach Anne Poirier started running programs about body positivity in Vermont in 2017. Then, in 2018, Jamil made an Instagram account called I Weigh, dedicated, among other things, to women posting selfies and writing things they value about themselves that aren\u2019t skin deep. Like having great friends. Or, er, having a net worth of $280m. Here\u2019s an example from Jamil\u2019s Instagram page: Jamil also spoke about body neutrality, and why she doesn\u2019t identify with the body positivity movement, during an interview on The Daily Show in September: Not objectifying women \u2013 haven\u2019t I heard of that before? There have been some feminists who have already spoken about wanting women to be freed from the shackles of expectation. Jamil isn\u2019t exactly the first. For example, Barbara Fredrickson and Tomi-Ann Roberts wrote in 1997 about how women internalize the objectification of men and begin to view themselves as objects. But they crucially missed one thing \u2013 they don\u2019t have viral Instagram accounts. So they\u2019re still waiting for that Taylor Swift shoutout. OK, so now there\u2019s body positivity and body neutrality \u2026 how am I supposed to feel good about my physical self? I\u2019m going to level with you: I\u2019m not sure. I think you\u2019re just supposed to do what feels right to you. While, obviously, using all the right phrases and posting a photo of yourself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
