He or she (who are we kidding? Of course it's a he) was into the latest Mercury music prize winner, ooh, ages before everyone else liked them. Oh, and he has opinions on the Booker, of course he does. For anyone not entirely insufferable, though, there is a get-out: bluffing. A quick scan of the newspaper the next day tells the ignorant all they need to know about this week's winner of the Mercury prize: that the xx are a trio of black-clad, pensive-looking twentysomething Londoners who make \"indie minimalism\". There: you have just about enough knowledge to skate through that next water-cooler conversation \u2013 without sacrificing a single listening hour. Bluffing is often looked down upon as cheating, but that is unfair. After all, which driver is ever sneered at for taking a short cut? Bluffing is merely an intellectual short cut \u2013 and one that prevents thousands of conversations from being killed at birth. Sociologists refer to cultural capital: the sum of references that enables one person to form social bonds with others. Bluffing is a way to gain cultural capital on the cheap \u2013 and it is easier than ever in the age of Google and Wikipedia. A couple of years ago the academic Pierre Bayard wrote How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read, which defended \"non-reading\" as a \"genuine activity\". This is the bluffer's manifesto. Well, apparently: we have only read the reviews, you understand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
