Even walking around some areas is similar to taking part in an obstacle race. The Big Dig - which is putting up the flyovers and elevated roads that traverse the centre underground - has been in full swing for years, and looks like it will go on for many more (you can even go on a tour of the works if you are that way inclined). The upheaval makes every-day travel a mystery tour of diversions, blocked roads and crop circles of traffic cones that you have to negotiate. If you have to drive, go to the outskirts and take the 'park and ride' (they get preference over other traffic) or the train to one of the four stations and then walk. Most of the attractions are central and well sign-posted - just be careful to avoid the potholes and piles of sand on your way home at night after a few drinks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
