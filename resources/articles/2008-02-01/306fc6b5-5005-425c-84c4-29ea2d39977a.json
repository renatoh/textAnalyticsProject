A horrible anti-climax. The most tedious fare served up since the last time Chelsea played Liverpool. A complete waste of their time, your time, my time, our time. A godawful nonsense, a shambles, an embarrassment, dreck. A pathetic excuse for sport, a risible effort at entertainment, a shameful, shameful, shameful shame. A shabby spectacle. So, so shabby. Lacklustre, flat, stodgy, unimaginative, insipid, drab, dull, drab, uninspired, drab, dull, drab, colourless, drab, dull, hellish, dull, dull, dull. There won't even be a fight. Best league in the world? Aye, right you are. There, that should do it, you'll thank me for this. Join me for what now promises to be a zinger from 5pm; kick off is at 5.15pm. Key to The Website Formerly Known As Guardian Unlimited Official Patented Fight-o-meter\u00ae, a state-of-the-art gadget our technical boffins have knocked together just in case there's a fight, which there won't be, but that's what we all want really, if we're being honest about it: A: Fight B: Homoerotic fight, tenderly directed by Ken Russell Topical aside with Tom Walker: \"Oh dear. Oh dear dear me. Rafa what have you gone and done.\" Meanwhile here's George Templeton: \"Of all the big four match-ups isn't this usually the one that produces the best football?\" Oh, I don't know, the last couple of Manchester United-Everton games have been crackers. Rooney's back, they haven't lost with him in the side this seaszzzzzzzzzzzzzz: Van der Sar, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Fletcher, Carrick, Anderson, Park, Rooney, Nani. Subs: Kuszczak, Saha, Scholes, O'Shea, Tevez. This lot are today dressed like Spurs: Lehmann, Hoyte, Gallas, Toure, Traore, Eboue, Fabregas, Silva, Hleb, Eduardo, Bendtner. Subs: Fabianski, Senderos, Flamini, Clichy, Adebayor. Referee: Alan Wiley (Staffordshire) The state of the pitch: State is the operative word here; the thing looks like something from the 1970s. I'm half expecting Franny Lee to slide across the pitch in his Derby shirt any minute now. And we're off: The game begins with a load of aimless hoofing. I'm not going to dignify it with a description. 2 min: Unlucky, unlucky Arsenal; Eduardo lays the ball off to Bendtner, whose tricky one-two with Fabregas on the edge of the area so nearly comes off. The second ball was millimeters out; the striker would have been clean through on goal. 4 min, including Kicking Liverpool When They're Down dept.: Nani runs down the left. He's in miles of space but he shanks the ball deep into the stand behind the goal. That's the sort of thing Harry Kewell does. Except for the running bit. 6 min: Anderson does well to win the ball off a labouring Gilberto. Then runs it out of play. Best teams in the league, best league in the world. 8 min: That's much, much better from Anderson, who instinctively latches onto a ball dropping just to the left of the Arsenal D and hammers a volley towards goal; Lehmann does well to get down to his right and make a clean catch. This is all a bit bitty, though. 10 min: United win a corner. Gallas takes a wild swipe at it, slicing it over the bar and into the crowd. The second delivery, from Nani, goes straight into Lehmann's hands. 12 min: Gallas is having a shocker, here. First the shank, now the loose backpass: his ball back to Lehmann is well short and the keeper does well to slide out of his area and hack clear before Rooney or Nani can make off and score. 14 min: SHAMBOLIC DEFENDING!!! Manchester United 1 - 0 Arsenal. Anderson heads powerfully into the box towards Rooney, who is two yards out. The ball should be easily cleared, but Justin Hoyte and his Amazing Concrete Shoes are waiting for a bus - Rooney is allowed to make a short run into space and head straight past Lehmann. That is spectacularly bad defending. Arsenal have not been good at the back so far. 19 min: AND NOW THEY'VE ALLOWED DARREN FLETCHER TO SCORE!!! Manchester United 2 - 0 Arsenal. Arsenal are useless at the back. Hoyte and his Amazing Concrete Shoes have taken root out on United's left wing, allowing Nani to scoot to the byline and dink a cross towards Fletcher and Gallas. Gallas appears to have a pair of Gypsum Slippers of his own, as he allows the Scotland midfielder to steal a yard and head home from two yards. Ever get the feeling you've been somewhere before? 22 min: Nani takes a free kick from the middle of the Arsenal half. It's floated into the box and Vidic isn't far from rising to get a header in from just outside the six-yard box. I've never seen an Arsenal team without Igor Stepanovs in it playing as badly as this. Meanwhile the badminding of poor Liverpool continues apace. \"Barnsley, yes!!!!\" screams Thomas Cope. \"I'm so excited, yet know one else in my middle-America neighborhood cares. They're wondering why I'm dancing in driveway and drinking a pint on Saturday morning. Tell me you care.\" I do care, Thomas, which is why I'm worried about your drinking. Please tell me you at least keep off the Special Malt Drink until the sun is over the yard arm. 25 min: Arsenal are a complete shower! They're trying to push up at the back but Anderson springs their offside trap with ease; sadly his ball to Rooney is a wee bit too strong and Lehmann can rush out to clank clear. It really is a matter of when, not if, United score another. 27 min: They've just run a replay of the Fletcher goal, and it's not his. He gets the merest of flicks to it, but it looks to be heading wide right. Which is where Gallas comes in, deflecting the ball past his keeper. This is a total farce. Arsenal need to get their gamefaces on, and quick. 30 min: A little bit of shoving down by the corner flag between Gilberto and Fletcher. It doesn't even rate a B on our The Website Formerly Known As Guardian Unlimited Official Patented Fight-o-meter\u00ae. 32 min: Rooney tries to recreate Paul Gascoigne's lucky scuff (oh alright, wonder goal) against Scotland at Euro 96, but fluffs his chip and drags a dreadful shot well wide. Hats off to him for trying, though. 33 min: A stunning cross from the right, under pressure, from Fletcher, who cuts the backtracking Toure out of the picture and finds Rooney in the centre; he chests down but screws his shot wide left. I mean it, when, not if. 36 min: Hleb has touched the ball! Yes, he has touched it! He really did! Meanwhile Niall Harden is holding out hope of a vicious fistfight somewhere down the line: \"Arsenal tend to lose the rag when things aren't going right for them so fingers crossed.\" 37 min: YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW BAD ARSENAL ARE AT THE BACK. Manchester United 3 - 0 Arsenal! This is turning into a rout. It's more slapstick cuts from Hoyte, Gallas, the Amazing Concrete Shoes and the Gypsum Slippers: Hoyte swans round like a dandy again, observing serenely as Nani latches onto a wonderfully weighted Carrick ball through the middle and pelts towards goal. Gallas doesn't really bother either, allowing the winger to stroke the ball into the bottom right corner. This is over. 42 min: Arsenal can't keep hold of the ball at all. Rooney nearly scoots free again, but this time Gallas does something right and moves up to catch him offside. Just. Even so, this is frankly embarrassing to watch. \"If Manchester United can avoid Barnsley in the next round, I fancy them to go all the way to Wembley,\" writes Gary Naylor. 44 min: Wes Brown does a few George Best turns down the right. Wes Brown! This is an utter farce from an Arsenal point of view (though there's no denying United have been very good). Then Hleb gives the ball away on the edge of the box. He's obviously been studying Rio Ferdinand's performance last weekend. Nani is wasteful and doesn't get a shot in. Half time: Manchester United 3 - 0 Arsenal. And that's it for the half. Arsenal have been woeful; they've taken this dressing up like Spurs thing way too seriously. So bad have they been, and so far behind are they, that I'm hopeful of a good set-to in the second half. Is that wrong? Is it? And we're off again. \"I am sure that everyone would be happier if you focused on the Liverpool-Barnsley result rather than bang on about the second half of this game,\" writes Andrew Short. Fair enough, this is all over, after all. \"All over? Three nil down at half-time used to be no sweat for some teams in red,\" crows Kopite Ian Copestake, who could have picked a better day to send his email, all things considered. 46 min: Nani swings in a free kick from the left... and Gallas manages to head it clear. Well done! Then Lehmann is forced to make a save from Rooney, who whacks a shot from just outside the box. 47 min: Eduardo is booked for hacking Rooney down outside the area. The free kick, just outside the left-hand corner of the box, is taken by Rooney and whipped goalwards - Lehmann needs two attempts to snaffle it. Mitch Low, of MBMs passim and who sails the North Sea on whatever the Bibby Sapphire is doing no work whatsoever, is \"very much considering staying offshore\" for every big game. \"Scotland-France, France-Scotland, Man U-Roma and of course, who could forget, Aberdeen-Bayern (a moral victory) - they always go my way. Then it goes tits up when I get onshore.\" 48 min: RED CARD!!! Eboue goes in on Evra studs up, mid air. Rooney rushes up to engage in trenchant discussion. The Arsenal player is told to do one by Alan Wiley - and refuses to leave the pitch Rattin-style. Unlike the 1966 Argentina captain, he did deserve to be sent off - and his protest only eats up 30 seconds or so. The Website Formerly Known As Guardian Unlimited Official Patented Fight-o-meter\u00ae rating: A minus. 51 min: Now Ferdinand is booked for slicing down Bendtner on the wing. This is heating up nicely; one red and two yellows within six minutes of the restart. I predict a mass brawl on 68 minutes. Meanwhile the Liverpool fightback begins. \"First, congratulations on an error-free game spelling-wise,\" rites Ross D. \"Shame about the Liverpool cheap shots but it's all part of Rafa's Champion's (sic) League winning tactics - at least he properly understands how crap the Premier League is. Hooftyhoof at 100 mph. Anyway, I just wanted to express my shock at actually hearing the crowd at Old Trafford.\" 54 min: Arsene Wenger is pictured yawning on the bench. It's almost as if he doesn't really care, isn't it. 55 min: A wonderful surge by Anderson from deep, then a lay off to Rooney. It's an exciting move, which only comes to an end when Rooney attempts to control the ball with his shin. 57 min: Carrick, who has been quietly brilliant today, pings another wonderful pass straight down the middle to spring the Arsenal offside trap. Sadly for United, Park completely misses the ball in his attempt to lift it first time over the advancing Lehmann. United are playing wonderfully well, but on the other hand Arsenal are a complete shower. 59 min: Rooney is booked for fannying around with the ball and not giving it back. 60 min: This is getting old. Now Gilberto is booked for hacking down an in-flight Park. \"Jens Lehmann will salvage the day for Arsenal in one of two ways,\" predicts Richard Graves. \"Either it'll be a hat-trick consisting of a penalty, a Pat Jennings style 'goal' kick and out Schmeichelling Man U by scoring with a header from a corner after a crazy run up the pitch in the dying seconds of the match, or he'll just go bonkers and beat up another Arsenal player.\" 62 min: That should have been four, as Rooney broke clear. Lehmann did well to smother his first shot and send him out wide right; his dinked cross back towards Park in the centre is weak and cleared easily by Gallas and his Amazing Gypsum Slippers. 65 min: United are just toying with Arsenal now, swinging ball after ball into the box from either wing, presumably waiting for some clown to balls it up. I am genuinely shocked at how bad Arsenal are today, this is a far worse performance than that infamous 6-1 tonking. 68 min: Arsenal string three passes together - yes, they really did it - but spoil the effect somewhat by ending the move with a hopeless shank into touch. 71 min: A brilliant curling effort from Nani, who nearly finds the top right corner after being set clear by Park. Then a triple substitution by Arsenal: Hleb, Fabregas and Eduardo make way for Adebayor, Senderos and Flamini. And a double change for United: Anderson and Rooney come off, Scholes and Saha come on. Arsenal Fan Attempts To Rationalise Total Shambles dept.: Thing is, Wenger's given up,\" types Samuel Baker, an admirable effort seeing his hands are gripping onto large amounts of straw. \"Without either Sagna or Clichy, and in particular Mathieu Flamini, we were always going to lose this one. The injury list is just too long to chase three trophies right now.\" 74 min: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE BE UPSTANDING YET AGAIN FOR JUSTIN HOYTE AND HIS AMAZING CONCRETE SHOES! Manchester United 4 - 0 Arsenal. Once again he allows Nani to skin him down the left; the winger stands the ball up, allowing Fletcher to power in from the right and slap a header into the roof of the net. Arsenal's defending tonight has been little short of a complete disgrace. 75 min: Fletcher is booked for upending Senderos. Then Adebayor is booked for a risible dive in the penalty area. 76 min: Nani juggles the ball on his head, then with his feet. All the while running at full pelt. Fantastic skills. The Arsenal players don't seem to like being made to look rather ridiculous, so Senderos tries to hack him down. Then Gallas kicks him in the thigh. Nani reacts by pressing his forehead on his opponent's. Nobody gets booked - though Gallas is lucky not to see red. The Website Formerly Known As Guardian Unlimited Official Patented Fight-o-meter\u00ae rating: B, verging on A. 80 min: Saha jinks brilliantly down the right and is about to burst clear into the box when he is cynically clipped down by Gilberto. Who has already been booked - and should have been again. Alan Wiley is being very kind to them here, they've totally lost the place. 84 min: United are stroking it around all over the pitch. Two minutes of impressive possession ends when Carrick, who has been immense, slices a wild shot over the bar. 87 min: Arsenal fan Samuel Baker, master typist and straw-clutcher, is now typing with his nose. \"Through real, salty tears.\" It could be worse, you should be down to eight men. \"Gallas and Gilberto should have red cards and crucial suspensions,\" hollers Gary Naylor from atop the lofty vehicle that is his high horse. \"The red card is a red card no matter what the scoreline.\" 89 min: Great save by Lehmann, who smothers at the feet of Saha as the striker attempts to poke yet another magnificent through ball from man-of-the-match Carrick into the net. Saha should probably have scored, but it doesn't really matter, now, does it. Full time: Manchester United 4 - 0 Complete Disgrace. Saha has a snapshot from outside the area which nearly finds the top left corner - and that's that. United were very good - Michael Carrick the star of the show - but Arsenal were terrible: a defensive disgrace in the first half, a disciplinary disgrace in the second. They should have had three men sent off, for the love of God. Three! Anyway, that's me outta here, allowing the last word to go to Justin Kavanagh: \"No doubt Eboue has ordered in the pizza for full time.\" Email: scott.murray@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
