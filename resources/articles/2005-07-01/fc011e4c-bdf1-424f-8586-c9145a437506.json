After nearly four hours of debates, the meeting at York voted in favour of setting in motion \"the process for removing the legal obstacles to the ordination of women to the episcopate\". The move threatens to split the church and today's yes vote will now set in motion church legislation that may take several years to implement. The first Anglican female priests were ordained in 1994 after a long campaign. Those pushing for women bishops believe it is a logical extension of that historic decision 11 years ago. But traditionalists in the church argue there is no biblical precedent for women bishops, as Christ's apostles were all male and some also believe it is wrong for women to have authority over men in a religious capacity. Last year, the House of Bishops published the Rochester Report, which examined the options facing the church but did not come down in favour of any of them. It also looked at whether arrangements would have to be made for those within the church who could not conscientiously accept women bishops. One option would be the creation of a \"third province\" for such people with its own bishops and archbishop, and an exclusively male episcopate and priesthood. The report said retaining the status quo would be unlikely to bring the argument in the church to an end, with those in favour of women bishops seeing it only as a temporary setback. Some members of the church have already said they will leave if ordinations are approved. Yesterday, the Bishop of Ebbsfleet, the Right Reverend Andrew Burnham, told the Sunday Times: \"Bishops would no longer be what they say they are. I would have to leave.\" Yesterday the Synod voted against a bill that would legalise voluntary euthanasia with just one member of the church's ruling body supporting the bill and 293 against. The Archbishop of Canterbury said he feared moves towards legalising voluntary euthanasia were being motivated by the need for cost-cutting in healthcare. Lord Joffe, who introduced the assisted dying for the terminally ill bill in the House of Lords last year, said: \"The result is disappointing and does not demonstrate, necessarily, a rational response to the issue, but one rather based on religious dogma.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
