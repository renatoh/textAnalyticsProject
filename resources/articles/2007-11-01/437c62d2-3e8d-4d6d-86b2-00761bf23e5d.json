Classes of 12- to 15-year-olds in six schools will be grouped into \"companies\", given a packet of mint seeds and told to come up with the best way to earn megabucks from it. They will then present their business plans to a panel of scathing judges, modelled on the dragons from the TV show Dragons' Den. The best will win \u00a3250. At the same time, schools can enter a national competition in which pupils' companies have until July to grow their packets of mint - and their wads of cash. The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (Nesta), which invests in projects that encourage innovation, is running the competition and will give the most successful company \u00a31,000 in Amazon vouchers. It's just a flavour of the thousands of events being held for Enterprise Week, which started yesterday and ends on Sunday. All over the country, schools, colleges, universities, voluntary and local government organisations and small and medium-sized companies are holding activities to inspire young people aged up to 30 to have ideas and act on them. But can you teach the skills needed to be a successful entrepreneur - such as risk-taking - or is it just a matter of spotting those born with it in their genes? Jack Lang, a millionaire who teaches courses in entrepreneurship at the University of Cambridge computer science laboratory, says the desire that makes an entrepreneur successful cannot be taught.\"You can teach people how to avoid mistakes, what goes in a contract and the language of business, but the basic desire has to be innate,\" he says. But Nesta's chief executive, Jonathan Kestenbaum, says that entrepreneurship can be taught - and more schools should do just that. In the next year, a host of projects are being set up to nurture the next generation of Henry Fords and Richard Bransons. Nesta is funding one in Rotherham, where pupils are encouraged to talk through the advantages of taking personal risks, such as putting their hands up in class to ask questions. Another, in Glasgow, asks pupils to use clear thinking to solve local companies' problems for them. Making millions aside, these projects give young people useful skills for life. Jessica Shepherd Feel free to eat in the corridor Success for one Somerset school has been its undoing. Bathford is a high-achieving primary school near Bath whose inauspicious environment belies its academic strengths. There is no school hall, and years 5 and 6 are taught in what Diane Grebby, Bathford's head, describes as \"dilapidated huts\". These have been on site for the past 18 years. \"You can put your hand through their walls, they leak and are very cold in winter,\" says Grebby. The permanent part of the school may be more solid, but it is compact to say the least. It's a low-ceilinged 1970s structure that was never finished because the money ran out after the first phase of a three-phase build. \"The original building had a small area for art and craft work, which we have converted into a hall, but really it links the two ends of the school,\" says Grebby. \"We have to do dinners, assembly and PE there. But it is also a corridor walk-through.\" Every day at Bathford is like New York's Central station during rush hour. \"It is quite dangerous at times,\" says Grebby. \"It's terribly squashed, and there are health and safety issues.\" Lunch can be particularly perilous as pupils have use whatever space is available to chow down. It seems that to get money for the hall, teachers would have to encourage pupils to do less well. In its last Ofsted report, Bathford was rated very good overall and excellent in a number of areas. It has 161 pupils, almost double the number a few years ago. But the school slips through the refurbishment net because academic achievement is high. And the area does not have the level of deprivation required to attract a lot of central government funding. \"The goalposts move every couple of years,\" says Grebby. \"Just as we get to the top of the list for refurbishing the hall, the criteria change.\" The school hopes to qualify for the money promised by the government for primary school refurbishment in 2009-10. But experience has taught Bathford not to assume anything. It has pooled five years of building-projects funding from central government to start work on two permanent classrooms. There is a \u00a317,000 shortfall that the school is meeting itself through fundraising - including a CD of Christmas carols sung by the children, now on sale for \u00a310. Meanwhile, it's another winter of hats, scarves and mittens for years 5 and 6. Matt Keating Setting traps for copycats Would-be university students may not have twigged yet but Ucas has started screening applicants' personal statements for plagiarism this year. There was no formal public announcement or bells-and-whistles press release trumpeting the change, but the university admissions agency let it be known by writing to schools that the days of borrowing other people's reasons for wanting to study Bulgarian at the world-beating University of Crewe are over. A software system called Copycatch is screening personal statements for overlaps with other people's, or with sample statements on the web. Those showing a level of sameness of 10% or more are then examined by members of Ucas's new, chillingly named Similarity Detection Service (SDS). Higher education institutions are being notified of applications where there are grounds for suspecting collusion, as are the suspects. Decisions about what action, if any, to take are being left to admissions tutors. \"It's a change in our operations, says Byron Price, a Ucas press officer, \"and something students will become aware of as they read information on www.ucas.com while making their application.\" A trial of the screening process earlier this year, using 50,000 of last year's applications, found that 5% had some borrowed material; 1%of these were \"significant borrowings\" of anything up to entire personal statements. These can be copied from websites, or bought. Of 800 medical applications, 370 contained the phrase \"a fascination for how the human body works\"; 234 attributed the start of their interest in science to \"burning a hole in [my] pyjamas at the age of 8\" and 175 alluded to having an \"elderly\" or \"infirm\" grandfather. As there were half a million university applicants last year, up to 25,000 personal statements, or one in 20, may have included borrowed material. Price says the key thing is that information in an applicant's personal statement - 600 words on why they want to study a specific subject - should be accurate and true. There is no problem if a parent assists an applicant, he adds, though he would question the morality of a parent writing an entire statement. \"We have no way of knowing if someone has done that,\" he says. \"But, really, it should be the work of the applicant themselves.\" Simon Midgley"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
