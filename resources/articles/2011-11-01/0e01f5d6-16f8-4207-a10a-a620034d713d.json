There is first the sadness at the humiliation and disgrace attaching to colleagues; fellow professionals, members of that small group of players lucky enough to have played international cricket. Then there is the sadness for the game itself. What sort of state has it got into that such things can happen? And how big is the iceberg of which the three no-balls were the tip? There is also the sadness for unsupported and misled youth. We are all tempted in some direction or another into destructive and self-destructive activities; we are all liable to pressures from powerful and sometimes ruthless others; we are all liable to fall in with degraded societal norms. My own cricket career, which finished in 1982, took place in a different epoch. I was never invited to throw a match, or an innings (I seemed all too able to get out without even trying). Nor did I ever hear speak of matches between counties being fixed, as Lord Condon once suggested might be happening in the 90s. In this respect, my generation of players was innocent: we lived in a Garden of Eden before the Fall. People occasionally gesture to the notorious bet placed by Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh on England to win the Headingley Test in 1981, bets that won them (I believe) \u00a35,000 each. I am completely sure that the laying of this bet had nothing whatever to do with match-fixing. Rather, it was an opportunistic bet laid by two inveterate tipsters when the odds offered in a two-horse race (500-1) seemed to them absurd, despite the fact that by this time one of the horses \u2013 the English one \u2013 was lame, out of wind, and several miles behind the other, Australian horse. The idea of anyone being paid money by a bookmaker to underperform in any way would have been unthinkable. Any such invitation, any suggestion of such an invitation, would have been laughed out of court (in fact it wouldn't have got anywhere near court). Yet by the 90s, the bookmakers and their often criminal agents were tempting players, drawing them in, and entrapping them. Some players succumbed, and clearly still are succumbing. Why it happened then is a broader sociological issue, but doubtless it was not a matter of chance that these scams coincided with scandals such as Enron's and the banking crises. I wonder if new forms and instruments of gambling, with its paraphernalia of hedging and complexity, and new modes of wealth creation, some of them dubious, provide the backcloth to spot-fixing. Such activities continue to be the major threat to the game. Any individual who engages in them, however apparently trivially, puts at risk not only his own career, but his profession and that of his colleagues and successors. Fixing throws into doubt the integrity of the whole first-class game. Followers no longer know whom to trust. Everything is suspect. Here is a small example of how mistrust and innuendo, once in, cannot easily get out. India performed badly in England this year, though against probably the best England side I have seen. In the last Test at the Oval, in the middle of August, with India 3-0 down, RP Singh was brought in. He had last played in a first-class match in January. His first over, to the two English left-handers, included five balls down the leg side, all at a very medium pace. Only one ball was on a good length and line. A distinguished commentator made this passing remark: \"Anyone betting on balls down the leg side in the first over might have made some money\" \u2013 an almost explicit reference to the spot-fixing scandal of a year before, on the same ground, Lord's, when Mohammad Amir had bowled a wide down the leg side first ball of the England innings, and later the two notorious no-balls. Fixing is in a different category from what we could call \"common or garden\" cheating: claiming a catch when you know the ball has bounced: picking the seam: using illegal substances on the ball. This ordinary cheating occurs within the framework of a game. It is a form of lying: not with words but in action. Those who do this are dishonest in order to gain an unfair advantage within the game by illegal or immoral means. As Simon Barnes noted in a recent article, when these things happen, the game goes on. When, by contrast, people stop trying, try to fail \u2013 not from collapse of confidence, or as a result of unconscious guilt and the need for punishment, but to make money, or as part of a corrupt scam \u2013 the game itself can hardly go on. Instead of proper competition, the activity has become a facade, an act. What Hansie Cronje, Mohammad Azharrudin, Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir did falls into a different category. Match-fixing and spot-fixing are a matter not of cheating within a game, but \u2013 one might almost say \u2013 cheating the game, the fabric of it. What they did undermines and falsifies the whole activity. Such activities have a ramifying quality to them, which ordinary, deliberate cheating in a particular moment lacks. In throwing a match (or fixing a spot) these players throw the whole activity into question. What's more, they cheat everyone \u2013 not just their opponents, but their own team, the public, and the game as an institution. The opponents are cheated because their victory and achievement becomes hollow. The rest of Butt's team, those not in the know or not in the plot, are cheated if their captain, or their members, are split in their allegiance to their success. And the public is cheated, and will rapidly become disillusioned, when they find out or suspect that this kind of thing has gone on. How, they may ask themselves, can I trust any player or team if you have let me down? The match-fixer treats everyone, and the game itself, with contempt. It is impossible from the outside to have any notion about who might turn out to be guilty. The revelations that shook the whole world of cricket more than 10 years ago involved a born-again Christian who conducted prayer meetings with his team before matches. When Cronje, the captain of South Africa, at first denied everything, Ali Bacher, the managing director of South African cricket, who had worked closely with him, backed him \u2013 speaking of his \"unquestionable integrity and honesty\". However, one thing my work as a psychoanalyst, as well as being in analysis myself, has impressed on me is that one can never take (human) appearances for granted; it can sometimes be the case that the larger the front, the larger the behind. In sports-mad South Africa, Cronje's good looks, excellent play as batsman and captain, and apparent decency and honesty, made him an ideal icon for the country as for advertisers. But he it was who stooped to serial dishonesty, even seducing the most junior players in his team to be his cronies. Cronje was a fascinating example of the splits that occur in so many people. On the outside, and in many of the contexts of his life, he was a decent, loving, honest, honourable man. But scratch the surface and you found this other self, this shadow self, corrupt, dishonest, devious, which he himself may have been puzzled by. For such reasons, those guilty deserve penalties with a deterrent element. I support the calls for strong action against people engaged in such corruption. At the same time, we need to recognise that the pressure put on a young player by criminal bookies and their agents, and by corrupt team-mates, can be appalling. As a result, there needs to be room for compassion as well as deterrence, especially if the player is willing to be enlisted in the battle against corruption. Like all secret organisations recruiting the naive for illegal activities, the criminals draw people in by involving them at first in complicitous activity that is in itself of minor importance. Just as communist parties (and other mafias) the world over would use new recruits to run errands, thus exposing them to blackmail and threats, so the bookmakers and their henchmen first lure a cricketer by offering money and/or approval for \"innocent\" information, such as the nature of the pitch, or the fitness of the players in their squads. As Virgil put it in the Aeneid: easy the descent to hell. There is but a short step into criminality. And once in, threats against the player and his family make it extremely difficult to get out. As Shakespeare wrote, after describing how \"the expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action\": \"All this the world well knows, yet none knows well: to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
