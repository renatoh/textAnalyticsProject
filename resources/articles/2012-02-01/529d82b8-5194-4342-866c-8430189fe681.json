Who could have imagined that he would walk free in the morning from the court and just a few hours later Fabio Capello would resign, leaving Harry as the favourite to take over as the next England manager. I know Harry as a friend, I also employed and worked with him as a manager, and, although it is not my place to say that a man managing at a top club, Tottenham Hotspur, should leave that club, I believe he is the right man for England. Harry has come up step by step, from Bournemouth, because he has the talent. He has two major qualities which make him an exceptional football manager. He is great at assembling a team, at seeing what I call the whole puzzle, and secondly, the players love him. Harry understands that the team is not all about the most skilful player in each position; it is about how the players work together. To get the best out of Gareth Bale, for example, it is also about who is playing alongside him. With Harry, two plus two always makes five, not three. Harry sees the whole picture. People think Harry is likeable and charming and this is why he has done well, but it is much more than that; he has insight. It is the same with the players; they don't love him just because he is loveable, they love him for what he gets out of them. He understands what is going on with all of them, what their issues are, what they need. When he feels it necessary, as you saw in court, he can be not friendly at all and will use a few fiery words. You will see sandwiches and the Coca-Cola flying in the dressing room if needed. But the players love him because he knows how to get the best out of them. I talked to Brad Friedel, about how he likes Harry at Tottenham. Brad said to me: \"He is special. He knows how to deal with every player.\" I always remember one example, of Steve Stone, when he was with us at Portsmouth. It was the week of the April 2004 match against Manchester United, the one mentioned so much in court. I was in Dubai, and somebody told me Steve Stone is on the beach. I said that was impossible, but I went outside and, from the back, as I got closer, I saw it was Steve Stone. He jumped up and said: \"Hello chairman,\" and told me he was in good shape, that the gaffer had sent him for some time off. I called Harry. I said: \"I've just seen Steve Stone on the beach in Dubai.\" Harry said: \"He's getting uptight, I need him to be fresh.\" And in the game, against Manchester United, who scored the only goal, who was the man of the match? Steve Stone. This is why the players love Harry. You will see Harry on the training ground but mostly he is concerned with the bigger picture, he leaves the physical conditioning to others, to Kevin Bond and Joe Jordan \u2013 and look how loyal he has been to them. I think he will thrive with England for a particular reason, too. At Portsmouth with me he never had big budgets to buy expensive players; the big signings were made after I left. At Tottenham he has had money, yes, but not on the scale of the other top clubs. Like I said in court, were they asking me to talk about the Harry I wanted to strangle, or the Harry I loved \u2013 because he was always asking for money, for two more players. I used to say to him: just once, tell me you only need one player! But for him to manage the international team, so that he can have any player in England, that will be his player, and he does not have to twist the arm of a chairman. He will be able to manage, to get the best out of those players. I feel the script was written on Wednesday, it was incredible, and the country would not be able to find a better man."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
