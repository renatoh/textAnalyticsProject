I heard nothing for six months and rang, to be told that I should already have received an offer for \u00a38,500. Forms were sent and I completed and returned my acceptance. I was told it would take 10 working days to arrive. I therefore booked a holiday on my Barclaycard thinking I would pay it off when the money arrived. But 10 days later nothing had happened, and when I called I was told it might take a further 15 days. I waited two weeks, then phoned again and was told that because I hadn't responded to the original offer (which I had never received), my claim would have to be reassessed. That was in July. Since then I've been fobbed off whenever I've tried to find out what's happening. I'm having to pay Barclaycard a minimum monthly sum for the holiday which, as a pensioner, I can ill afford to do and the stress is making me ill. GD, Accrington It never ceases to amaze me how swiftly banking systems can pursue customers who delay payments and how cumbersome they become when the boot is on the other foot. Banks, of course, thoroughly dislike the right to claim for mis-sold PPI and are liable to suffer bouts of amnesia when it comes to compensation. Barclays discovered an appropriate sense of shame when I contacted it. It has apologised, recalculated what you are due and is sending \u00a38,832.95. It has also credited \u00a3325 of goodwill to your Barclaycard.
