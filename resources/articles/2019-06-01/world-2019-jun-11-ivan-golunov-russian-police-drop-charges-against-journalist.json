Vladimir Kolokoltsev, the interior minister, said the decision had been taken because of a lack of evidence to support the controversial charges, which were widely viewed as an attempt to silence the journalist\u2019s hard-hitting exposes of corruption. Golunov, who said police planted the drugs on him, had faced up to 20 years in prison. He was beaten in custody and denied access to a lawyer for over 12 hours. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe in my release,\u201d said a smiling Golunov, 36, after leaving an interior ministry office, where he was formally cleared of the charges. He was met by cheering journalists and well-wishers. \u201cI need some time to get my breath back.\u201d He said he was unlikely to claim compensation for the fraudulent charges brought against him by police: \u201cCompensation for emotional distress would be if charges like these are never brought against anyone again.\u201d Golunov also insisted he would continue working as a journalist, but said he would not be investigating his own case. \u201cI would have a conflict of interests.\u201d Kolokoltsev said he would ask Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, to dismiss Andrei Puchkov, the police chief for western Moscow, where Golunov was detained, and Yuri Devyatkin, the head of the city\u2019s anti-narcotics department, over the police\u2019s handing of the case. There was euphoria among independent Russian journalists as the news broke. \u201cThis is a victory! We are happy! I\u2019m crying!\u201d Ivan Kolpakov, the editor of Meduza, the Latvia-based news website where Golunov works, wrote on Facebook. \u201cTogether we did something incredible: stopped the criminal persecution of an innocent person,\u201d Meduza said in a statement. \u201c[But] this is just the start \u2013 there is a lot of work ahead to make sure this never happens to anyone again.\u201d The developments came after an unprecedented display of solidarity from Russian journalists and cultural figures that piled massive pressure on the Kremlin. Three major Russian newspapers on Monday ran near-identical front pages in defence of the journalist, whose arrest was seen as a watershed moment for independent media in Russia. Thousands of people were due to defy a police ban on unsanctioned protests to rally against Golunov\u2019s arrests in Moscow on Wednesday. Protests had previously taken place in Moscow and other Russian cities, as well as outside Russian embassies in Europe and the United States. The first major indication that Golunov\u2019s release was imminent came earlier on Tuesday when Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the Russian parliament\u2019s upper house and a longtime ally of Putin, lashed out at the police\u2019s handling of the case. \u201cThis a very bad story,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many questions that the public must receive clear and intelligible answers to. This is either unprofessionalism, recklessness or a provocation.\u201d Matviyenko, who is nominally the third most powerful politician in Russia, said the case had been taken under the personal control of Yuri Chaika, the prosecutor general. The Kremlin admitted on Monday that mistakes had possibly been made in the handling of the case. The police\u2019s case against Golunov started to collapse almost as soon as it was brought. A series of forensic tests failed to reveal traces of drugs in either Golunov\u2019s urine or on his fingers. Shortly after his arrest, police published photographs that they said showed a drug lab at his rented flat. The images were swiftly deleted from the interior ministry\u2019s website after a police spokesman admitted they had been taken at a different location and bore no relation to the charges against the journalist. Police described the incident as \u201ca small mix-up\u201d. Human rights groups said police in Russia often plant drugs on suspects. Golunov\u2019s arrest was condemned by figures across a wide spectrum of Russian society, including Kremlin-loyal media. Dozens of journalists from state news agencies signed an open letter calling for the charges against him to be dismissed. Presenters on Channel One, state media\u2019s flagship channel, also demanded a transparent investigation into the case. There were unconfirmed reports, however, that Kremlin officials had permitted state media to support the journalist to lay the groundwork for the rare about-face by the authorities. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, denied media reports that the government was seeking to settle the Golunov case before Putin\u2019s annual question-and-answer show with the public on 20 June, where he would have almost certainly faced awkward questions about the journalist\u2019s treatment. Before the police backed down, nearly 25,000 people had signed up to a Facebook page expressing their intention to take part in a protest march on Wednesday in solidarity with Golunov."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
