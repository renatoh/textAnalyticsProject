Capello may not look much like Jim Carrey, but there was something about his relief on escaping to Italy that recalled the closing moments of The Truman Show, where the lead character eventually works out he has not been experiencing real life but floundering about in a gigantic television studio for the amusement of watching millions. Carrey's character keeps noticing that the same situation is repeated over and over again without anyone else thinking it odd, and the Football Association also seems to believe it can get away with shameless regurgitation in a similar manner. If it was hard to suppress a titter when listening to its chairman, David Bernstein, explaining that England's new plan was to be like Spain, and seamlessly change a manager between winning the European Championship and winning the World Cup, it was easier to recall wearily that Howard Wilkinson scripted that spiel well over a decade ago. Thrust into the spotlight following Glenn Hoddle's unforeseen departure in 1999, the FA's then technical director said it was vitally important that England should always have a managerial succession in place and should never again have to cast about in desperation to find a new man at short notice. What happened next? Kevin Keegan happened next, Wilkinson found himself back as caretaker as early as 2000 in Finland, and the rest of a chaotic story is too familiar and recent to need retelling here. Capello was just the man England wanted four years ago, yet was holding England back by the time he approached the end of his contract, and this is a pattern that we all know is going to be repeated in the future, even if it is not obvious at the moment what Harry Redknapp will end up doing to morph from genial figure into the most hated man in the country. This is what always happens, for the simple reason that an England manager can only ever be as good as his players, and the ones in England are not very good. Even when we imagine we have a useful crop and a reasonable chance English players generally contrive to arrive at tournaments exhausted, injured or suspended. Capello cannot have been looking forward to Euro 2012, after seeing how ineptly his players performed in South Africa two years ago, and that was before he lost Wayne Rooney to a stupid foul (Rooney's word) and his captain to clumsy interference. Had the FA wanted to help its coach, instead of making his position untenable, it could have used its influence to try to bring John Terry's case to court as soon as possible, not simply acquiesce in Chelsea's desire to have it put back. Bernstein admitted at Wembley that the rescheduling of the trial had effectively doomed both Terry and Capello, yet if Chelsea could obtain a court date of their choice then surely the FA could have exerted pressure of their own to have Terry dealt with swiftly. Such inertia was always likely to exasperate Capello, and behind the diplomatic words few at the FA were sorry to see him go. Like many fans the governing body blames the Italian for an underwhelming World Cup and believes the only way England can travel to Poland and Ukraine with any confidence this summer is with a new manager. That last bit might actually be true. For all Capello's club pedigree \u2013 and the stats that make him out to be the most successful of England managers \u2013 he turned out to be about as clueless as his players when it mattered. What England need most is to play without fear, to use one of Capello's favourite expressions, and appointing a manager who is less remote and severe \u2013 which means almost anybody \u2013 will facilitate that. Yet while the sainted Harry will doubtless oversee an upsurge in optimism and maybe even performances, it should be remembered that he too has no tournament experience and must cope without Rooney for the first two games in Ukraine, as well as finding a new captain and dealing with the fall-out from the Terry situation. It will not be the easiest of introductions, and given England's fairly woeful record in tournaments a long way from home, the possibility exists that poor results could fatally damage his standing before he has even had a chance with the less demanding World Cup qualifiers that follow. It is now being quite sensibly suggested that England appoint a temporary stop-gap, some experienced tournament hand such as Guus Hiddink or even Sven-Goran Eriksson who could take his chances in the Euros then leave the coast clear for a longer-term appointment. Redknapp could then finish the season with Spurs and make his decision over the summer. All neat and tidy, save for the sod's law contingency that the night-watchman takes England to a semi-final or better. Except looking for someone dispensable would not really be sensible at all. Just last week England had a manager who was dispensable. He was going to leave anyway, and you cannot get much more dispensable than that. We didn't like him, he didn't care. We only had to put up with him for another four months and we couldn't manage that. Even though Spain were beaten at Wembley. Sensible is not what English football does. We would far rather be in permanent crisis. Like Newcastle United a few seasons ago, it seems to be the only way we can get any attention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
