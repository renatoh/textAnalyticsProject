Born in Rio de Janeiro, he went on to control a media empire centered around the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper - today the country's largest circulation daily. Frias was raised in Sao Paulo and studied at a Jesuit college. After leaving school aged 15, he worked as an office boy for a gas company in Sao Paulo. Rising through the ranks there he moved into the civil service, working in accountancy, and then into real estate. His move into media did not come until 1962, when he purchased the Folha de Sao Paulo with an eye to revolutionising the Brazilian newspaper industry. The revamp began in 1975. One of his most successful moves was introducing the \"page three\" - daily comment pieces from all sides of the political spectrum, which placed the paper at the vanguard of political debate. Frias considered himself a businessman, not a journalist. Those who worked under him, however, remember him as the man behind a number of high-profile political scoops and who pioneered online journalism. In many ways Frias was also a campaigning journalist, who dedicated part of his career to the fight for democracy. In 1964, a 20-year dictatorship known for human rights abuses and censorship, came to power. Initially, Frias' newspaper supported the coup that toppled Brazil's leftwing president and ushered in the military regime. As a result of death threats from the extreme left, the Frias family spent a year living in the newspaper headquarters. But from the second half of the 1970s the Folha became a staunch supporter of democracy, giving a voice both to the dictatorship and its opponents. In the early 1980s, at Frias' behest, the Folha championed the campaign for direct, democratic elections. Financially, the media group also achieved considerable success. Frias helped construct a huge media empire, the Grupo Folha, second only in Brazil to the massive Globo operation. In 1996, the Folha's circulation peaked at 1.5m copies. As well as several other newspapers the group also controls Latin America's biggest internet group, UOL, which receives over 10m hits a day. Last year the group's profits were estimated at nearly \u00a3200m. In the 1980s, Frias transferred control of the paper to his two sons, Luis and Otavio, now president and editor respectively. But until last November he was at editorial meetings with ideas for articles and helping with the day-to-day running of the paper. He is survived by his wife, Dagmar Frias de Oliveira, two sons and two daughters. \u00b7 Octavio Frias de Oliveira, journalist and businessman, born August 5 1912; died April 29 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
