Pochettino turned down the advances of Real Madrid this summer to sign a new contract with Spurs. In the past week, however, the club have emerged from the transfer window empty-handed and postponed the opening of their new \u00a3850m stadium. The Argentinian said he had no regrets about his decision and insisted he wants to be on \u201cthe frontline\u201d as Spurs try to win their first trophy in his four-year period as manager. \u201cFor me it will be the toughest season and I think if we want success we have to give more than our best,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to give 100%, it\u2019s 200%. \u201cWe know from inside that it will be hard and, because we are warriors, we want to fight. We want to be proud at the end, we want success and we do not want to complain or make excuses. I am a winner and I love the challenge. We want to go again.\u201d The manager apologised to fans for the current uncertainty after the new White Hart Lane was found to have problems with its \u201ccritical safety systems\u201d. Spurs will play Fulham at Wembley on Saturday and Pochettino said: \u201cI think we all feel disappointed with the announcement from the club this week. I want to say thank you to the fans and apologise and try to reward them by winning games. \u201cI want to be there, in the frontline, fighting. I feel the responsibility and that is why I am here. I am very grateful to Daniel Levy. I think Tottenham gave us, me, my family and my staff, a lot of things that always we will be grateful for. This was a moment to say \u2018we are going to be with you all\u2019, because we knew what was going to happen.\u201d Spurs have agreed to play three Premier League fixtures at Wembley this season, but an opening date for the new White Hart Lane is still unclear with the location of the 28 October clash with Manchester City listed as \u201cTBC\u201d by the club. This match cannot be played at Wembley on that date because of a pre-arranged NFL fixture and Premier League rules prevent any team from using three stadiums as their home ground in a given season. Pochettino said he wanted the City game to be played at Wembley if White Hart Lane was not ready and would even be willing to play the day after the NFL match. \u201cAt the moment I cannot say we are going to play this game at our new stadium. If you ask me, if we can\u2019t play there we need to find a way to play at Wembley. Maybe we need to adapt. The day after the NFL game maybe the pitch is not in the best condition but we need to make the effort and to play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
