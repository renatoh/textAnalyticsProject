I am embarrassed to have to bring this up. Dear readers, examine my format. Compare it with that of the other columns. What do you notice? Jon Ronson has that photo of himself looking up at the title of his column. Craig Taylor has an illustration. Lucy Mangan has that photo of herself, arms crossed, green blouse, very pretty. Guy Browning gets a nice illustration. Even the person doing the Q&amp;A gets a photo. And then there's me... Nothing. Is this, perhaps, anti-Americanism? Am I paying the price for the sins of my president? Seen as a specimen of an imperialistic, arrogant nation, am I being subtly mocked? Or perhaps it is simply a case of anti-Saundersism. That is, maybe someone has seen a photo of me? Is that it? I speak on behalf of all balding, middle-aged American men. No, let me not limit myself: I speak on behalf of the balding, middle-aged men of all nations. Just because we are unpleasant to behold, does this mean people should not be forced to look upon us? I declare a kind of Internationale of the type of men people tend to glance at, then look away from; men not revolting, just bland. We are your uncles, your fathers, we are what young men are afraid of becoming. Our looks speak of solidity, decent investments, early bedtimes, sensible shoes. When we speak to the young girl at the checkout, she glances around alarmed, wondering where that voice is coming from. When her eyes fall upon us, she is neither excited nor repelled. It's as if she is looking upon the very air. We say something witty, she rolls her eyes, mutters something to the virile stockboy, who sniggers and then runs his hand through his (thick) hair. This hurts. We are not animals! We can still dimly recall the days back in the 70s when we, in tight synthetic-material trousers and \"platform soles\", strode through checkouts very much noticed indeed! We were totally hot, even though that phrase had not yet been invented. We were \"foxes\"! We were \"funk-meisters\"! The leadership of this movement is not something I'd have wished for but, finding myself in the cross hairs of injustice, neither will I relent. Based on the number of my columns above which no image has appeared, I believe I'm owed roughly a full page of \"George-representation\". So, dear readers, next week you will find, if there is any justice in the world, a full-page spread of yours truly, wearing one of my early \"disco\" outfits. Though it may not be pleasant (I have, OK, put on a few pounds), I implore you to gaze upon it. Do not avert your eyes, do not decline to open the magazine, do not purposely blind yourself during the week. Work for justice, I beg you. Look upon me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
