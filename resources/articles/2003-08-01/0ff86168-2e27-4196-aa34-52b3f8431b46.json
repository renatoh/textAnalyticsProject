The first is whether Andre Agassi, at 33, can win the title once more, and the second is whether Andy Roddick, 21 next Saturday, can make the big breakthrough. \"It would be spectacular for Andy to win the US Open for the first time, and it would be spectacular for him and Andre to make the final,\" enthused Arlen Kantarian, the chief executive of the United States Tennis Association. \"I think Andy is a very special package. Not only is he winning but he's got those rock star good looks and he is a presence everywhere he goes. He's the kind of person that in the future could really begin to define the US Open as Jimmy Connors did 20 years ago. He's already had a tremendous impact but we're in no rush. Whether he breaks through this year, next year or the following year we're looking forward to it.\" Kantarian, the USTA and everyone connected with tennis in the States know how much the success of Roddick, a semi-finalist at the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year, means to the game in the US. \"When our kids see someone with that kind of spirit and that kind of character, they want to go to sleep dreaming of being Andy Roddick.\" So goodbye Andre and goodbye Pete Sampras. A-Rod is the man, and you'd better believe it. And so had he. \"This could be an unbelievable US Open with five-setters galore but if Roddick doesn't do well, or an American doesn't do well, then it will be seen as a disappointment,\" said Patrick McEnroe, the US Davis Cup captain and brother of John. \"That's disappointing to me but that's the reality. The other reality is that if it's a great tournament and Roddick wins it, then that's going to be huge for US tennis.\" And not just for the States either. \"The whole game needs the American tennis market to be healthy\", added McEnroe. \"And without being biased, world tennis needs America to have players winning majors.\" Ian Wight, director of the pre-Wimbledon Stella Artois tournament, agrees. \"A win for Roddick would increase television air time and money and, with Tiger Woods having a little hiccup, it could not come at a better time.\" Outside the slams, tennis has lost its gloss. Prize money has dwindled. Success for Roddick will not suddenly turn everything around, but it would give tennis a commercial fillip, principally in the US from where the world market is driven. \"Andy has got a lot of charisma, a lot of personality and he's fun to watch. He plays with a lot of energy and people like to watch him,\" said McEnroe. Which could make Tim Henman the most unpopular man in New York if he beats Roddick in the first round. \"Tim's the only guy to beat Andy in 21 hard court matches since Wimbledon. It's a reality check for Andy, it's a wake-up call because it's a really tough draw, but I still think Tim's going to lose.\" Roddick describes the last year as a \"whirlwind\". Pick up any magazine in the States and there he is with his girlfriend Mandy Moore, or alongside his new coach Brad Gilbert, who in a couple of months has transformed Roddick into a genuine contender. But even this is not enough for America. He must win the big tournaments and that means the US Open. And not next year or the year after, but right now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
