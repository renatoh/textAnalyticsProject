You can imagine what Max Clifford might have advised: Let me see - you've been off the box since January and your appearance on Have I Got News For You was a fiasco. Soon you will be forgotten, so you have a stark choice: you can do bushtucker trials in the rainforest, or be shouted at by Gordon Ramsay, or follow Vanessa Feltz into the Big Brother house. But Robert Kilroy-Silk had a better idea - what about running as a Euro candidate for the UK Independence Party? It sounded far-fetched but, amazingly, it worked. His picture has been in the papers every day and, when he produced the incomparable gift of Joan Collins, the nation's joy was unconfined. But supposing he wins? Do we have to take him seriously? After all, he was a Labour MP from 1974 to 1985 - unlike most UKIP candidates, he is not a complete naif. And, through his column in the Sunday Express, through his l6 years on Kilroy!, he can claim to have mastered that terrifying beast, Middle England. He could in theory take over the leadership of the Ukip - perhaps rechristen it the Joan Collins Fan Club. But is that really what he's about? I went to see him at his home in Buckinghamshire - a substantial pile formerly owned by Ozzy Osbourne. He was in a meeting when I arrived, so I chatted to his wife Jan, whom many people consider to be the brains behind Kilroy. They were school sweethearts in Birmingham and have been married for 42 years, with only a slight blip when he was found to have had a love child by a mistress while he was an MP. Later, he told me, 'I fancy Jan now as much as I ever did and I love her probably more now I think - I can't imagine loving her more than I do. She's my best friend, the person I trust.' She runs all his business affairs and, as we shall see, exercises considerable influence over his politics. Soon Kilroy appears - he looks tired and a bit less orange than of yore, but still handsome, at 61. He says he's been campaigning non-stop and it's a vast constituency, the East Midlands, covering six counties. Does he think he has a chance of winning? 'That's difficult to say. If it wasn't for the postal vote, I think probably we would. YouGov did a poll before it was announced that I was standing and 5 per cent said they would vote for Ukip and then they asked if Robert Kilroy-Silk was a candidate how would you vote and it went up to l5 per cent. And that was before we even started campaigning. So on that basis we should win because you only need l4 per cent to be guaranteed a seat. But the postal ballot is a great imponderable.' His involvement with Ukip started a couple of months ago when he had lunch with his friend the Earl of Bradford (Ukip candidate for the West Midlands) at their house in Spain. Kilroy was banging on about Europe and Bradford suggested he should stand. He thought it was too late, but Bradford somehow fixed it and the constituency invited him to stand. 'I said I would only go there if they wanted me almost by acclamation - I used that word - and they assured me they did.' But he only met the other Ukip candidates a couple of weeks ago at the launch of the manifesto. 'I'm being absolutely honest about this, it all happened very quickly and we were looking at each other saying \"This is amazing\". And for me it was wonderful, it was incredibly fortuitous, because of the time in my life and everything that's happened to me since I got sacked by the BBC, and all the political correctness - not being able to speak your mind and stand up for your country, not to feel ashamed about being British. I thought it was too late, that I'd missed the boat.' I casually remarked that I first came across Ukip a few years ago when it was campaigning on a pro-hunting manifesto. Kilroy yelped as if I'd shot him. 'Don't! Don't start that!' But what did I say? 'Don't mention it to Jan! She is virulently opposed to hunting. That's the one thing that does divide us - Jan is totally anti-blood sports'. So if Ukip started campaigning for hunting, she'd be upset? He shudders, rolls his eyes to the ceiling and says, 'Oh I think she'd be deeply upset.' But doesn't she KNOW what the Ukip stands for? 'Oh she does know, because she read the entire manifesto. Jan is a very political animal - in many ways more political than I am. [Her father was a shop steward.] She has much stronger views and she's very well informed. And she read the manifesto well before I did, the whole lot. She read it on the plane coming back from Spain, and I'm sitting there thinking Ohmigod, she's going to find something terrible, what will she say? Because I hadn't signed up to it then but I'd kind of made up my mind and it was a big decision, because I could look a right prat. And if Jan had turned round and said \"This is awful\", that would have sunk me. But she didn't. She turned round on the plane and said, \"This is my party\".' Did he read the manifesto? 'Yes, of course I read it before I said I would go ahead.' Even so, he doesn't seem entirely familiar with Ukip's literature. The party's website has 'A message from Robert Kilroy-Silk' which includes the sentence, 'I want to explain that we do not have to put up with immigration being out of control.' When I quoted it, he asked sharply, 'Where did I say that?' On the Ukip website. 'Oh right,' he said. 'Could you repeat it?' So I did. 'Oh that's fine,' he said, obviously relieved that he could endorse his own message. 'Well what that says is what the Prime Minister said a couple of weeks ago when thingy resigned [presumably Beverley Hughes] that our immigration system and asylum system is a shambles, that it's out of control - and I think that's terrible. We have to be in control of our borders, we have to know what numbers of people are coming here and where from. What I do think is wrong is for us to go all around the Third World recruiting nurses and depriving the Third World of people who are needed there, when we've got four million - or is it two million? - unemployed.' But that message - 'We do not have to put up with immigration being out of control' - will seem like a green light to racists. 'No of course it's not. That's the trouble - that means that people cannot have a view on an important issue and make sensible remarks without being called a racist. That's terrible, that's the level to which it's come, and that is why people feel so bitter and resentful, they cannot express their genuine anxieties without being accused of racism.' He claims that he is not a racist and that his remarks about Arabs in the Sunday Express were misinterpreted. He says if I read the column, I would find that 'it talks about Arab regimes, Arab states, it never talks about Arabs.' Strange, because I have the column in front of me and it does talk about Arabs and asks 'What do they think we feel about them? ... That we admire them for being suicide bombers, limb-amputators, women-repressors?' But he persists in believing that 'There is nothing derogatory there. I was actually standing up for downtrodden Arab women.' Sweet! Anyway he was severely punished for those views - sacked by the BBC from the show he had fronted for l6 years. At the time, the BBC said that he might return as a presenter in some different capacity, but he says now, 'I wouldn't hold my breath.' They also agreed that his company, Kilroy TV Co, could continue to produce a show for the morning slot. But the show, Now You're Talking, will end next month. 'The BBC decided not to recommission it because the ratings halved, basically. They told me, \"It's not the same programme without you, it doesn't work without you.\" So all the staff will lose their jobs? 'Yes. The crew, the cameramen who worked with me for l6 years, the nannies that looked after the children, the people who drove the cars - there was a whole kind of family and that's been destroyed.' And does he blame himself for that? 'Of course,' he says, but immediately goes on, 'I am not responsible. The BBC, as everyone in the street says, they come up to me and say \"You were treated badly\". That's the expression I get everywhere. \"It's terrible what they did to you. I used to love your programme, I used to watch it while I did the ironing\". 'Now all those people, all those nice people - my mum, your mum, my aunts [his mother is dead; my mother has never watched Kilroy ; I can't speak for his aunts] - all the people I've been meeting for the last two weeks or so, good, decent people - have all been disenfranchised by the BBC. Their views weren't taken into account. And that's what we mean by politically correct - there's no better example than the way in which I was treated. It was political correctness gone mad.' So this is the nub of it - he is speaking for all 'these nice, decent, hard-working people' disenfranchised by political correctness, from waving the flag, from saying what they think about immigration and also, perhaps more important, from watching Kilroy!. Their voices are not heard: only Kilroy can speak for them. And indeed he often does, putting on a strange sort of Dora Bryan char-lady accent - at times he delivers such long monologues in this voice you wonder if it's a sort of alter ego, like Dame Edna with Barry Humphries. 'Oh we know who Kilroy is,' he burbles, 'we know he's not impartial, we know he's got strong views - that's why we like him, because he speaks for us, he gives the people in authority a hard time, he gives them a kicking.' He utters reams of this stuff, claiming to be the voice of the public, chattering endlessly about the virtues of Kilroy. He says he 'can't remember' what he's been doing since he left the BBC in January but he's been very busy. 'All I know is that I haven't had time to do all the things I wanted to do. I used to complain at work, I'd say \"It's a bloody nuisance being here - I've got things to do at home\". And I have - I breed oriental pheasants, I've got three aviaries, with cockatiels and parakeets, I've got deer. I love gardening and I never have enough time to sit down and read all the books I want to read.' He also claims to be writing a book, but he won't tell me what on - not an autobiography because 'I don't think it's time yet'. But also he is 'in talks' about a television venture. He claims he doesn't miss TV. 'People think you want to be on television but - you will believe me or not as you wish, but I can only tell you the truth - it would never bother me if I was never on television again. I'd be very happy to stand behind the camera if they'd pay me the same amount of money they pay you to be on screen. I don't get anything like the buzz from television that I get from politics - there's no comparison.' So would he be prepared to make the financial sacrifice of devoting his life to politics? Would he, for instance, give up one of his houses? 'Would I? Could I? Of course I could, but would I? I would not want to be poor. I've been poor, very poor, and I would never want to go back.' Not poor, I suggest, but just less rich - make do with one large house instead of two? 'I wouldn't want to do that because they [the houses] mean so much to the family - the children, the grandchildren and my larger extended family - all our aunts, uncles, cousins congregate here several times a year. My Jewish friend tells me that I'm an honorary Jew because of the way I place this emphasis upon the family - I don't know where that comes from, perhaps because my father was killed in the war - but I do feel a responsibility for them. Jan says I'm a control freak.' It sounds as though he's pretty committed to maintaining his lifestyle, which means he has to keep earning big money. I asked what he'd been living on since January. 'Well I write for the Express and I have my own income - but I'm not going to go into that.' How does he see his future? 'It's a very difficult question. I don't know. There's too many things I want to do and I'm not sure which one I want to pick as the frontrunner. My job wasn't my life - it gave me my life, it gave me the means to lead my life. But there's so many options now about where we live, how I earn a living, that it's a bit bewildering.' I notice he doesn't say that he will be leading Ukip to a brave new dawn, or even that he will be serving as an MEP. Perhaps the bushtucker trials still await."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
