The latter had the stronger force of soldiers but Athens had the better navy. Pericles reckoned he could harry his opponents from the sea and still keep his city supplied with food. It was a disastrous decision. More than 300,000 Athenians were crammed together inside the city\u2019s long walls \u2013 which connected Athens to its port, Piraeus \u2013 in sweltering heat. They became ripe targets for disease and a plague swept through the city \u201cwithout restraint\u201d, according to the historian Thucydides. Athens\u2019s population was reduced by between a third and two-thirds. The guilty agent has never been identified, though typhus, anthrax, smallpox and malaria have all been blamed. The misery and death is not disputed, however. And thereby hangs a tale, says Mark Honigsbaum, a journalist and medical historian. As he reveals in this riveting, vivid history of modern disease outbreaks, there is nothing like armed insurrection to bring infectious mayhem to a continent. Consider the recent examples of Liberia and Sierre Leone in west Africa. Decades of civil war and fighting had left both nations weak and under-resourced when an outbreak of Ebola in 2014 swept in, killing more than 11,000 people. This was a grim tally but by no means the worst, says Honigsbaum. \u201cDuring world war one, the congregation of tens of thousands of young American recruits in training camps on the eastern seaboard of the United States and their subsequent passage to and from Europe provided the ideal conditions for the deadliest outbreak of pandemic disease in history,\u201d he tells us. That outbreak was, of course, the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed a total of 50 million people worldwide and which has become a byword for \u201cviral Armageddon\u201d. Crucially, war was not the only factor in its spread, Honigsbaum adds. Doctors at the time were convinced flu was caused by a bacterium then called Bacillus influenzae. This was not the case, of course: B influenzae is merely an opportunist microbe that infects weakened lungs. The real cause of flu was a virus that was not pinpointed until the 1930s. As in so many other cases, the medical profession had become the prisoner of a particular pet theory that blinded it to the identity of the real threat to humanity. War plus ignorance make a terrible combination. In total The Pandemic Century presents us with nine examples of disease outbreaks that have afflicted humanity over the last century, among them the appearance of the Zika virus in Brazil in 2015 and, bizarrely, the great parrot fever pandemic that struck the US in 1930. In the latter case, parrots were discovered to be passing on deadly pathogens to their owners, spreading a disease that continued unchecked for months \u2013 because scientists had misidentified the agent involved. It was only when the real killer \u2013 a bacterium called Chlamydia psittaci \u2013 was identified that doctors were able to tackle the condition. In fact, only 33 people were killed by parrot fever in the US and even fewer in Europe \u2013 which somewhat strains Honigsbaum\u2019s definition of a pandemic. This is a small complaint, however. Honigsbaum has written a fascinating account of a deeply important topic \u2013 for if the past 100 years have taught us anything, it is that new diseases and viral strains will inevitably beset us, no matter how sophisticated science becomes. As Honigsbaum puts it: \u201cPestilences may be unpredictable but we should expect them to recur.\u201d \u2022 The Pandemic Century: One Hundred Years of Panic, Hysteria and Hubris by Mark Honigsbaum is published by C Hurst (\u00a320).
