Up to 800,000 federal workers were told to stay home after the White House and Congress failed to strike a compromise on a government spending bill. Workers deemed essential and armed forces personnel were asked to stay at work. If the shutdown continues, they will probably go unpaid. Armed services personnel abroad got their first taste of the cuts when they were told they would not be able to watch Sunday\u2019s NFL playoff games, because the armed forces broadcasting network had shut down. With crisis talks under way, Trump cancelled a trip to his Florida retreat at Mar-a-Lago, where he had hoped to celebrate his year in office at a gala dinner. Instead, as protesters marked their own anniversary of major anti-Trump demonstrations outside the White House and in other major cities, the president stayed in Washington, firing off angry tweets. Trump sought to blame Democrats for the shutdown, claiming they were putting immigrants before other Americans. Democrats blamed Trump, for walking away from a compromise over the future of young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers. They pointed out that the shutdown, the first since October 2013, was the first when one party controlled all three branches of government. At a press conference, the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, alluded to a tweet Trump wrote in May 2017, saying a shutdown would be good for the country. \u201cHappy anniversary Mr President, your wish came true,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cYou won the shutdown. The shutdown is all yours.\u201d Addressing the House, the Republican speaker, Paul Ryan, said: \u201cSenate Democrats refuse to fund the government unless we agree to their demands on something entirely unrelated. They want a deal on immigration. And then they\u2019ll think about reopening the government.\u201d Saturday\u2019s talks were focused on passing a stopgap spending measure. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said Trump was being updated and had been in touch with Republican leaders. At a White House briefing, the director of legislative affairs, Marc Short, signalled a concession when he said Trump would sign a resolution to keep the government funded for three weeks. The spending bill rejected by the Senate late Friday night would have kept the government open for four. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), Obama-era legislation that allowed approximately 700,000 Dreamers to stay in the country, is set to expire on 5 March after being rescinded by Trump. Democrats have refused to support any spending bill that does not restore such protection. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said in a statement he believed a continuing resolution \u201cthrough 8 February\u201d and a commitment to \u201cseek resolution on immigration, disaster relief, military and government funding, Chip [children\u2019s health insurance], and other healthcare related issues\u201d would pass the upper chamber. But Short said Senate Democrats were \u201cbasically conducting a two-year-old temper tantrum in front of the American people\u201d and said: \u201cWe will not negotiate the status of 690,000 unlawful immigrants while hundreds of millions of tax-paying Americans, including hundreds of thousands of our troops in uniform and border agents protecting our country, are held hostage by Senate Democrats.\u201d The White House budget chief, Mick Mulvaney, accused the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, of lying about his Friday meeting with Trump. Trump and Schumer shared a cheeseburger lunch at the White House. The president reportedly agreed to more time for a deal on Dreamers in return for more defence spending, funding for a border wall and tougher enforcement of immigration law. But the deal frayed and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff and an immigration hardliner, called Schumer to kill the talks. On Saturday, Schumer said dealing with President Trump was \u201clike negotiating with Jello\u201d, later adding that this was \u201cbecause he can\u2019t stick to the terms\u201d. Schumer\u2019s No 2 in the Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said a bipartisan group of senators had been on the verge of an agreement late on Friday, only for Ryan to inform his counterparts in the Senate that House Republicans would not agree to it. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, insisted in an email the speaker and McConnell had been \u201cin communication and full agreement throughout\u201d. The Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey said Republicans had ceded their negotiating position to a bloc of hardline House conservatives. \u201cI was not elected to genuflect to the Freedom Caucus,\u201d Casey said, before walking to the floor to vote down the funding measure that passed the House on Thursday. By Saturday morning, it appeared the White House had calculated that the Democrats had made themselves vulnerable to blame. In a CNN poll, 31% blamed Democrats for the shutdown, 26% blamed Republicans and 21% held Trump responsible. Although there is broad support for protecting Dreamers, a majority thought it was more important to avoid a shutdown. On Capitol Hill, there was some optimism. Emerging from a bipartisan meeting of around 20 senators, Graham said progress had made with McConnell agreeing to only a three-week funding bill and promising the Senate would address key issues. However, citing his colleague Lamar Alexander, Graham said \u201cshutting down the government as a negotiating tool is what chemical warfare is to war\u201d. Others who did not attended that meeting felt cautiously hopeful. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, said there was \u201ccertainly a real possibility [of a deal] if there\u2019s good faith on both sides\u201d. In his view, Friday night saw \u201cthe first real serious negotiations about this [spending bill] which only happened because of the vote result\u201d. Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican, said Democrats \u201cmay have wanted to bring out their Trump posters for a couple of days, show their extreme elements of the party that they were with them\u201d. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign released a new ad \u2013 which claimed Democrats were \u201ccomplicit in all murders by illegal immigrants\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
