That postponed the moment when Sky would have to plump for either the four-times Tour winner or his team-mate and it was far from the conclusive breakthrough that Froome might have hoped for. The further Thomas goes in the leader\u2019s jersey \u2013 and he should now hold it at least until next Tuesday \u2013 the more his confidence will rise and the stronger the questions will become around Froome. That was reflected in the fact that Thomas\u2019s sprint win in the yellow jersey at the Alpe was a \u201croyal one\u201d, from an elite lead group of five. It was not the first time the Alpe had seen a scenario of this kind; the future world champion Gianni Bugno took the 1990 stage from a group of similar calibre including the future winner, Greg LeMond. What it said was that Thomas is \u2013 for the present at least \u2013 Team Sky\u2019s strongest rider. When Froome, the four-times Tour de France winner, made his move at 3.5km to go, overtaking the long-time stage leader Steven Kruijswijk, the script in recent years would have been for him to forge ahead, and at least cut into Thomas\u2019s advantage. Instead, the Dutchman Tom Dumoulin reined him in, reflecting the fact that with the eclipse of favourites such as Richie Porte, Adam Yates and Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n, the 2017 Giro d\u2019Italia winner looks increasingly like Team Sky\u2019s biggest concern, together with the Frenchman Romain Bardet. So ended another afternoon when Alpe d\u2019Huez did not truly smile on Froome. He has faced one contretemps or another when he has raced up the Tour\u2019s most iconic climb. In 2008 he was in his apprenticeship with Barloworld and finished 10 minutes behind the winner, Carlos Sastre of Spain, although he managed to cling on to the front group at the foot of the ascent before blowing completely. Five years later the transformation into a Tour winner had been completed and Froome arrived at the Alpe in the yellow jersey, only to endure one of the more trying mountain stages of his career. That year the hairpins were climbed twice and on the second ascent he made what looked like a conclusive attack with Nairo Quintana, only to suffer a bout of hypoglycemia when he ran out of energy in the final five kilometres, after being unable to take food from the Team Sky support car, which had suffered an electrical failure. His then team-mate Porte passed him a couple of gels but he was given a 20-second time penalty because the Australian had gone back to the car for the gels after the point where feeding became forbidden. En route to his third win, in 2015, when the Alpe was the final major ascent of the Tour the day before the finish in Paris, it got worse, as Froome was struggling with chest issues, which he had deliberately concealed. He had come under assault from Alejandro Valverde and Quintana earlier in the week \u2013 and had faced opprobrium from the French roadside crowds \u2013 and he finally cracked, losing 1min 26sec to Quintana, and seeing his lead cut to 1min 12sec. This fits a pattern, however. Even though the list of winners features some of cycling\u2019s greatest climbers \u2013 Marco Pantani, Joop Zoetemelk, Joachim Agostino \u2013 the Alpe does not always reward multiple Tour de France winners. Bernard Hinault is the only five-times winner to take a stage win on top of the mythical 21 hairpins but his victory in 1986 was handed to him by LeMond after their legendary joint escape and triumphant ride up the climb. Winning on the Alpe was not a priority for Miguel Indur\u00e1in while in the era of Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx the Tour did not visit it. LeMond never won there while the double winner Laurent Fignon went to his grave regretting being made to ride conservatively up the ascent in 1984, forgoing a probable stage win in his year of grace. On the day, Fignon thought he would have ample chances in future to take victory on the Tour\u2019s most prestigious finish, but he never found the same form again. With victory having slipped away from Froome yet again, it may be that, even if he does take that fifth Tour, the Tour\u2019s most prestigious mountain may elude him as it did the Frenchman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
