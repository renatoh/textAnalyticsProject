His brother passed the 11-plus and went to the smart grammar school in the leafy suburbs of Chester. John failed it and went to a secondary modern in Ellesmere Port on the muddy mouth of the Mersey. His brother got a new bike from their father for passing the exam. John didn't pass. So John didn't get a bike. You could argue that this searing adolescent experience probably made him what he is today, which is one of the few people in the government who is licensed to shout at Tony Blair. Ray Prescott is not a member of the cabinet. It is the bike-deprived John, the son driven by that childhood humiliation, who is Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, an achievement that has eluded many people with strings of fancy qualifications after their name. That has not reconciled him to that early rejection, the source of a profound and lifelong feeling of insecurity, and an enduring and burning detestation of selection in education. Tony Blair protests in public, just as he has in the course of private, heated arguments with his deputy, that increasing selection is not the purpose of his schools reforms. Introducing more diversity and extending parental choice certainly are supposed to be the point. That is much too much for many in the Labour party. Choice can only ever be a friend to the pushy middle-classes and an enemy of the working classes. That is the thinking which runs through Mr Prescott and many on the Labour backbenches. Their cry is that reform will create two tiers of schools as iniquitous as the old split between grammars and the rest. They simply cannot have noticed that we already have multiple tiers of schools, a range from the brilliant via the average to the terrible, a system in which where you live and what you can afford are more likely to determine where you child goes to school than his or her needs and abilities. Some critics on his benches ask why the Prime Minister is spoiling a good record on education by unleashing another burst of change which seems to imply that Labour has achieved nothing over the past eight years. The government does have a reasonable story to tell on education. Standards of numeracy and literacy in primary schools have gone up. The biggest leaps in attainment have been in the areas of highest poverty. Class sizes have come down. GCSE and A-level scores are better. Spanking new facilities have replaced decrepit buildings. There are 32,000 more teachers than there were when Labour came to power. They are better rewarded, with the result that the calibre of those coming into the profession is rising. These are creditable gains. David Cameron, leader-presumptive of the Tory party, says he wants to drop the 'Punch and Judy' approach to politics. If he is serious about that, he should not pretend that Labour has done nothing for education. There have been improvements. And so there should have been when the amount spent per pupil will have doubled from 1997 to 2008. The claim Tony Blair would like to make, but can't, is that he has created the 'world class' schools that he wanted to be one of the central legacies of his premiership. He once thought that state schools could be made so successful that only the colossally snobby or the madly eccentric would consider paying out more money on top of their taxes to buy a non-state education for their children. In this ideal Blairland, Britain would have become more like the rest of Europe, where only a tiny minority use private schools. In that ambition, the government has flunked. More than half-a-million children were in private education last year. In London, a rich city so poorly served by state schools, approaching a fifth of parents go private and many more say they would do so if only they could afford the fees. That is a rise in those paying to escape state education since Labour came to power. In fact, a record number of children are now in private schools. No matter how fantastic the offer from the state, there will always be people for whom a non-private education will not be good enough for their children. But half-a-million children are not all going to Eton and its cousins. Many of these parents and children are refugees from a state system that is failing them. It is also, and more importantly, letting down many children whose parents do not have the money to buy an alternative to poor schools in the existing unequal state system. I don't want to spoil your Sunday with too many numbers, but some of them are worth recording because they are so strikingly awful. Forty three per cent of 11-year-olds are still leaving primary school without an adequate grasp of the 3Rs. A similar proportion fail to get five good GCSEs. Forty thousand children leave school every year without any qualifications. That is why so few working-class children get to university. As Mr Blair noted in his important speech on Friday, it is not bias in admissions. It is because not enough working-class children are doing A-levels. Some of the changes proposed by the government are so obviously sensible that the wonder is that they should need a law to implement them. Schools will be obliged to give parents a report on their children's progress at least once a term. The only extraordinary thing about this is that it isn't obligatory already. It is generally a bad idea for one organisation to combine the conflicting roles of providing a service and representing those who use the service. It makes sense to recast local education authorities as commissioners of education who will champion the interests of parents and children, and challenge poorly performing schools to do better. The most potent criticism of Mr Blair is not that he is going too boldly, but that he has not had the courage of his convictions. He points to the international evidence that diversity and choice drive up standards. He extols schools in Sweden and American charter schools. But he is more radical in theory than his government will be in practice. For all the sound and fury it is generating on the Labour backbenches, the independence that Tony Blair wants to offer state schools is a very constrained version of freedom. Local authorities will still control most of the funding; teachers' pay will still be set centrally. Parents will have to navigate a bureaucratic labyrinth to get action taken against failing schools and demand the opening of new ones. If they want to vary the curriculum or try different term times and lengths of school days, heads of schools will have to go begging for permission from the Education Secretary. There is an intellectual muddle, the result of trying to square the pursuit of excellence with Labour's allergic reaction to competition in education. Although Ruth Kelly has said that 'schools will have the opportunity to develop their own mission, purpose and ethos', they will be denied the use of academic selection to achieve that. I have yet to hear a logical explanation from a minister for why it is right for specialist schools to select by ability in sport or music, and fine for faith schools to select on the basis of belief, but it is always wrong to select on the basis of aptitude in science or English. A genuinely diverse and sophisticated secondary system would have a wide spectrum of schools to meet the great variety of talents and needs of different children. I suspect that this will turn out to be another of those reforms which leaves Tony Blair wishing retrospectively that he had gone further. This is much less revolutionary than some of his more provocative rhetoric has suggested. Even so, it is still too much for many of his backbenchers. Middle-class parents are revealingly denounced by Labour MPs for trying to get into decent schools as if it is a crime for parents to want a good education for their children, as if it is not also the ambition of working-class parents. John Prescott's unhappy schooldays cannot be the right basis for deciding how future generations of children should spend theirs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
