For a brief period at the start of the match City did indeed look like a side capable of finishing in the top four. Yet once Villa had quickly responded to Rolando Bianchi's opening goal, John Carew bringing the scores level with a piece of individualism that heralded a masterful exhibition of centre-forward play by the Norwegian striker, City were increasingly concerned with preserving one point rather than gaining three. \"We will see what happens in the next two games at home to Blackburn and Liverpool,\" said Eriksson. \"They are extremely important if we want to be where we are at present in the new year.\" City's 100% home league record is keeping them among the elite and for credibility they need a perfect Christmas at Eastlands. Away from home, a lot - perhaps too much - depends on how opponents deal with Elano. At West Ham on the opening day the Brazilian was allowed the run of Upton Park and City won 2-0, their only away league victory so far. Since then opponents have been wising up, knowing that when Elano is less effective his team have few creative options. It took Aston Villa a while to remember this. Nobody paid Elano much attention at the start and after 11 minutes he had time and space to pick out Martin Petrov on the left. From the Bulgarian's dipping centre Bianchi turned up unannounced to give City the lead. From then on Nigel Reo-Coker stayed much closer to Elano and neither Petrov nor Darius Vassell on the opposite flank received such service. The rest of the match was largely dominated by Carew's frequent hassling of City's centre-backs, Richard Dunne in particular. On the quarter-hour, in Villa's first serious attack, Carew muscled his way past the City captain to drive the ball past Joe Hart. The Norwegian is a member of the dodgy knees club but showed here how effective he can still be. On the half-hour he again forced an opening and again produced an incisive shot, only this time Hart managed to deflect the ball on to a post. A little earlier Hart had been beaten by a mishit shot from Gabriel Agbonlahor, Elano hooking the ball clear, although replays suggested the ball might have crossed the line. Either way Villa had other chances to win, the best coming seven minutes from time when Reo-Coker, having broken away at speed after a City corner, advanced on the right with Agbonlahor running free to his left. A simple, square pass would surely have sufficed but Reo-Coker waited too long before releasing the ball.
