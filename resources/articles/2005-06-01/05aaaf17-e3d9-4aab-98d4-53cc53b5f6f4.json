Sackloth and ashes as omen, perhaps? Why now? A century of Lions have not before needed such official, chirruping drivel. \"We're stronger together,\" the lyric wails on . . . well, it strikes me they seem weaker by the match for going into the shortest Lions tour in history with a flawed \"cast of thousands\" policy. At its end, I dare say more than 50 will call themselves Lions of 2005. Sure, it is far easier to be a Woodward Lion than not. Attempting to befuddle opposition on selection more often than not betrays your own flather. The nature of the Lions and their crucial immediate meld of disparate strands and talents means, surely, that the likely Test team for next Saturday should have played together tomorrow. Tuesday in freezing Invercargill is pushing a \"final trial\" too far. Four days . . . The power of four - back home, with the fans, it's the disputatious hair-splitting of four, more like. Young Cusiter has looked pin sharp but, alas for Scotland, not as needle sharp as Peel. Has Ireland's bonny Byrne already played himself in and soft-shoed D'Arcy played himself out? What about the sheer classy verve of Murphy? And the ditto power of Shanklin? And so on . . . I sense Celts beginning to fume . . . when in doubt, form or no form, knight of the realm Woodie will go for his own familiars, and rely on the ancient Emerson dictum that, against the odds,\"of all men the Englishman stands firmest in his shoes\". In which case, Land of Hope and Glory might as well be next week's pre-Test anthem. With heavy emphasis on Hope. Birthday boy Tom, just 78 The MCC too often gets clobbered, so it's good to applaud its inspired choice as president this Ashes summer. A figure to match the grandeur of the seminal series, Tom Graveney remains the genuine article he was at the crease. Tonight the former Bristol Grammar schoolboy fittingly hosts on his Nursery End patch the grand Eton v Harrow bicentenary banquet. TWG bestowed joys to the game; he remains full of the joys himself, and yesterday was his 78th birthday. In May 1948 he tried out with Gloucestershire (\u00a33 10s a week). In 11 innings he averaged a puny 14 (ducks against Oxford and Hants, a pair v Derby). He was told \"thanks but no thanks\" - on his birthday. Later that summer, when Glorse stalwart Jack Crapp was suddenly called up for England, Tom was recalled for one final chance . . . Precisely 18 birthdays on England turned to 39-year-old Tom in apologetic desperation - and he hit an imperishably sublime 96 against West Indies at Lord's, cheered to the echo. Tears cascaded down his countryman's cheeks as he came back through the Long Room. \"I'd been dumbfounded at such a reception. Then I realised it was happening for me,\" he recalls, fully 39 birthdays on. Skuleboy stuff So Arsenal must bonfire hundreds of thousands of catchpenny Viera shirts because they did not know their long-time captain had two \"i's\" in his name. Serves 'em right. Is it London? I have an old Millwall programme in which, throughout, the old Den-ites couldn't bother properly to spell the name of their opponents ie: Middlesborough. Middlesex scorecards at Lord's misspelled the surname of Gus, their fine Test bowler, as \"Frazer\". Which reminds me of cricket's worst boob. Before Pakistan's famous inaugural tour here in 1954, the MCC secretary agreed himself to order their kit in London. On arrival, the gold-wire badge on their blazers carried the legend: PARKISTARN. Munster PS Carried away recalling last week the fabled day the Shannon ran dry, I neglected to mention details you needed of Alan English's rollicking book which celebrates Munster's triumph in Limerick over the All Blacks in 1978 - Stand Up and Fight (Yellow Jersey Press, \u00a310). Seamus Dennison's tackle might have set up the 12-0 hooley but Corkman Christy Cantillon's try sealed the drama. Tony Ward chipped crossfield, full-back in black Brian McKechnie ummed and erred, Jimmy Bowen took the bounce and was free : \"I was flying ... I thought I'd make it all the way.\" But Jimmy generously passes to Christy, who hurtles over the line and into blessed immortality. And to this day Christy dines out on his Mastermind joke: Magnus Magnusson: \"James Bowen, what did you do with the line at your mercy?\" \"Pass\" \"Correct!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
