The existing pay agreement between the RFU and the Rugby Players\u2019 Association \u2013 which rewards the players handsomely for appearances, training and image rights \u2013 expires at the end of this season and the Guardian understands a new deal has not yet been finalised. The RFU is forecasting losses of up to \u00a350m over the next 18 months, with the chief executive, Bill Sweeney, the rest of the executive team and the head coach, Eddie Jones, all agreeing to pay cuts of more than 25%. A salary reduction programme has also been introduced across the organisation and it is understood the RFU does not consider players\u2019 match fees off limits when it comes to cost-cutting, with a union spokesperson stating it was \u201cin dialogue with all aspects of the game\u201d. England are due to tour Japan in the summer for a two-Test series but, assuming that and the June fixture against the Barbarians is cancelled, the new pay deal will come into effect before Jones\u2019s side next take to the field. The England squad is thought to be the highest paid in the world \u2013 a disparity highlighted when it emerged Samoa earned just \u00a3650 per man for a recent autumn international at Twickenham. For reaching the World Cup final last November the England squad earned more than \u00a34m \u2013 of which more than \u00a31m was bonuses \u2013 but it is understood unbudgeted World Cup bonuses were offset by higher-than-anticipated ticket and hospitality revenues at recent Twickenham matches. In the aftermath of the final defeat by South Africa, Sweeney said there would be similar resources available to plot a course towards 2023 but the coronavirus pandemic has had a brutal effect on the global game. USA Rugby has filed for bankruptcy, New Zealand Rugby is implementing a 40% cut on all staff with losses of \u00a350m expected and talks under way with players, while Australia is forecasting a loss of \u00a360m and has stood down 70% of its workforce with discussions also taking place over pay cuts for players. This week both Wales and Scotland have also announced cost-cutting measures with executives and coaches agreeing either salary reductions or deferrals, while the potential for a further hit for the home nations was raised this week when Rugby Australia cast doubt on whether their autumn internationals will take place. In the RFU\u2019s case, home matches can generate more than \u00a310m and account for 85% of the union\u2019s revenue, with Australia one of four visiting teams due at Twickenham in November. With the summer tours highly unlikely to take place, the revenue-sharing model, in which Twickenham banks all the revenue from the three autumn Tests that take place inside the official window, may be altered to assist the southern hemisphere nations, adding to the RFU\u2019s financial concerns. Jones said on Wednesday that he expects his squad to be \u201cready to go\u201d when rugby resumes and revealed he and his staff are in communication with the players, providing them with equipment and training programmes. \u201cRugby has always inspired teamwork,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things we talk about with the England team is how you can become a better teammate. Now, for everyone, it is about how you become a better citizen. One of the values we talk about is togetherness. Watching everyone standing outside of their houses and applauding the NHS was an indication of the great togetherness of society.\u201d Premiership players, meanwhile, are already facing pay cuts, with clubs introducing a blanket 25% reduction, the majority of which were due to kick in on Wednesday. As revealed by the Guardian, there is considerable unrest among players at the cuts following legal advice provided by the RPA. Premiership clubs are also set to put their squads on furlough and claim the \u00a32,500 a month per player available as part of the government bailout while still paying their squads wage top-ups."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
