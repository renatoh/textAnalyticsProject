A growing but still niche interest, loved by teenage girls, clubbers and Dalston hipsters, nail art turned a corner on Sunday night when Rebecca Adlington showed her union-flag painted nails to the post-race cameras after winning bronze. In an instant, the sight of the British swimmer in her still-wet hair and no-nonsense one piece swimsuit transformed the image of nail art, bringing it from bling to mainstream. Where Flo Jo's nails were famous for their extraordinary length, the modern Olympian nail is all about patriotism and intricacy of design. This may be the first beauty trend ever to be spearheaded by professional swimmers. This week, the Aquatic Centre has seen more nail art than any nightclub in London. Lithuania's Ruta Meilutyte, Italy's Stefania Pirozzi and several of the American swimmers, including Missy Franklin and Allison Schmitt, have already showcased patriotically coloured, striped or flag painted nails. For swimmers, whose cap and goggles serves to almost obliterate their appearance, nail art lends an opportunity to get in character. They are playing national heroes, after all, and those tiny, glossy flags are part of that. But nail art is not confined to the pool. Archery is a sport where the classic portrait will feature a hand drawn close the cheek. The Briton Amy Oliver and the Australian Elisa Barnard have both noticed this, and taken advantage with patriotic manicures which show up on camera. And perhaps the boldest manicure belongs to the tennis player Venus Williams, whose red nails feature blue and white stars \u2013 and a cheeky stripe of gold. Where Flo Jo's nails were famous for their extraordinary length, the modern Olympian nail is all about patriotism and intricacy of design. Nail art allows these young women \u2013 and most of these Olympians are, of course, very young \u2013 to show allegiance not just to their country, but to their generation. Nail art speaks to younger women watching, sending a message that serious sportswomen can still have a sense of fun, and a penchant for glamour. And it seems the message is being heard loud and clear. Lily Allen \u2013 whose Twitter feed has shown her to be an avid watcher of the Olympics this week \u2013 tweeted a picture of her nails, with one painted in a union flag and another with the five Olympic rings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
