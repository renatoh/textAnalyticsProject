You know Nascar - the motor sport we here in the US prefer to your Formula One, where the cars actually turn right on occasion. While F1 deals with industrial espionage scandals and the nagging sensation that most races, if not entire seasons, are predetermined, Nascar is struggling with a different dilemma: how to win back its hardcore, old-school fan base while selling them out. That brings us back to Sin City. The Nevada desert has a rich history of rocket-powered vehicles aiming for speed records and mobsters gunning it away from newly buried victims, but stock car racing is relatively new (for the uninitiated, Nascar races \"stock\" models of Fords, Dodges, Chevrolets and Toyotas, souped-up but otherwise similar to the cars you can buy down at your local dealer - hence the saying around the garage: \"Win on Sunday, sell on Monday\"). But the powers-that-be in the sport (the France family, who started Nascar in 1947 and continue to control it with an iron fist) abandoned races at traditional tracks in the southeastern US, the sport's epicentre. Gone are races at small spots like North Wilkesboro and Rockingham (both in North Carolina). Most offensive to longtime fans of stock car racing was Nascar's decision to kill off the traditional Labour Day race in Darlington, South Carolina (the Southern 500) in place of a race in (gasp!) California. Leaving Remote Redneck for Cool Cali and Vegas Baby Vegas seems like a no-brainer, and in any other sport it would be. But Nascar grew into the nation's fourth most popular sport on the unwavering, often fanatical devotion of fans that don't much cotton to the increasingly bland, corporate feel of Nascar. These are the fans that buy products based on the sponsorships of their favourite drivers and shave the numbers of those cars into their back hair (the men, too). Now from a cynical marketing perspective, the traditional blue-collar, working-class (read: not much disposable income) audience is always jettisoned in favour of a more swish crowd of influential buyers. But in its zeal to lure the fat wallets of the corporate crowd, Nascar is finding that those jilted Bubbas aren't so easily replaced. TV ratings, which in the last couple of decades grew straight and steep as the Eiger Nordwand, have levelled off. More disturbingly, race-day crowds have fallen off drastically, as expensive petrol broadsides the working class, and awareness grows, even among the most deliberately ignorant, that driving 500 miles in a circle for sport might not be the best use of our dwindling resources. It's too late to stuff the toothpaste back in the tube, or in this case, dump the flavour-of-the-month crowd in Vegas to return, like a wayward lover in a country song, to the mountains of Carolina, where the sport has its underpinnings (the fellas who delivered illegal moonshine whiskey to customers while avoiding the law are the Neanderthal to Dale Earnhardt Jr's Homo Sapien). But Nascar is taking steps to alleviate the haemorrhaging of its traditional base. The most noteworthy is the relaxing of punishment for drivers who engage in a little extracurricular violence. Watching drivers deliberately ramming the competition at 180 miles an hour is one of Nascar's main appeals, as is savouring the post-race fisticuffs that often result. In the past decade, as the sport reached out for a classier breed of white men, and mortgage companies and brokerage houses replaced motor oils as major sponsors, this aspect of the spectacle was deemed too ugly, too Roman Coliseum for the new white-shoe milieu. Now, having remembered that violence is as American as cherry pie, as H Rap Brown said, the bloodlust is back. As a result, when drivers Tony Stewart and Kyle Busch, hard-chargers as prickly as they are talented, got into a scrape on the track and a rumoured punch-up afterward, they were given slaps on the wrist and a \"now, now, boys\". Previously, they would have been docked points and money. I say \"rumoured\" because no one actually witnessed said brawl, and the drivers themselves have been coy about it. Nascar is a sport rife with conspiracy theories, and most wouldn't put it past the France family to order up a fake fight just before the Daytona 500, the \"Super Bowl of motor sports\", to prove to the rank and file that old-style racin' is back. Whether a winking attitude toward vehicular combat is enough to regain the faithful is questionable, especially as the interminable season drags through race after race. What Nascar really needs to do is shorten the season (currently a 36-race death march), make its playoff-style \"Chase\" over the final 10 races more varied in terms of tracks (including F1 type road courses and bullring short tracks among the cookie-cutter mile and a halfs would be a nice start), and stop listening to the bean-counters in the finance department who whisper sweet nothings about the potential riches in places like the Pacific Northwest and (the horror!) New York City. Stock car racing is just fine the way it was, thank you very much."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
