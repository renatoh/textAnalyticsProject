Former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, at his first public event following Clinton\u2019s campaign announcement on Sunday, also endorsed a national $15 minimum wage \u2013 the only major potential candidate for US president to do so. O\u2019Malley has treaded lightly before officially declaring a run for president himself, with carefully prepared answers and the release of a video on Wednesday that indirectly alluded to Clinton\u2019s evolution on same-sex marriage just hours earlier. Since Clinton hit the campaign trail, he had avoided mentioning her by name. But in response to a question from the Guardian at an event at Harvard University on Thursday, asking for his response to Clinton\u2019s updating of her positions on both marriage as a federal right and driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants in the days following her high-profile announcement on Sunday, O\u2019Malley pressed harder. \u201cI\u2019m glad Secretary Clinton\u2019s come around to the right positions on these issues,\u201d O\u2019Malley told the Guardian during the forum at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics. \u201cI believe that we are best as a party when we lead with our principles and not according to the polls. \u201cLeadership is about making the right decision, and the best decision before sometimes it becomes entirely popular.\u201d While the response did not represent a direct attack line from Clinton\u2019s would-be rival, it represents the most confrontational moment from O\u2019Malley toward his potential opponent since Clinton announced her candidacy on Sunday \u2013 with perhaps many to come before November 2016. O\u2019Malley told the audience at Harvard that he would decide whether to run in May, but his sideways encounter with Clinton arrived over two issues on which the former secretary of state has evolved from being out of step with the Democratic party\u2019s progressive base, which is calling on O\u2019Malley to challenge the frontrunner. Ahead of an official campaign stop in Iowa on Wednesday, Clinton\u2019s campaign team released a statement, confirmed by the Guardian, expressing her support for same-sex marriage as a federal constitutional right. The position marked a reversal \u2013 coming just two weeks ahead of a supreme court hearing on the issue \u2013 from last year, when she told NPR that she thought marriage legality should be decided by the states. O\u2019Malley, who signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in Maryland, has said that marriage equality is \u201ca human right\u201d and should not be left to the states. Clinton also stumbled over the issue of driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants in a 2007 presidential debate. She was eventually forced to release a statement to avoid a potential flip-flop: \u201cAs president, I will not support driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented people,\u201d she said. As governor, O\u2019Malley signed a bill allowing illegal immigrants to get driver\u2019s licenses in Maryland. Following nationwide \u201cFight for $15\u201d protests on Wednesday from striking workers seeking a federal minimum wage of $15 per hour, Clinton sent a tweet: \u201cEvery American deserves a fair shot at success,\u201d she wrote, echoing calls for wage equality from the campaign trail \u2013 without endorsing or even mentioning a number. At Harvard on Thursday, O\u2019Malley pointed out that he raised the minimum wage in Maryland to $10.10, insisting he would have gone higher with legislative support. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see, I predict, more and more metropolitan areas raising their minimum wage,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s going to make their cities and metro areas stronger.\u201d Unlike Clinton, O\u2019Malley is still not a declared candidate. He said would make a decision as to whether he was running for the Democratic nomination for president by the end of May. \u201cIt\u2019s a colossal undertaking, and there are many different components of [a presidential race]\u201d, he said at Harvard on Thursday. \u201cOrganisation, policy, personnel \u2013 its a lot to put together. \u201cI\u2019ve never run a bad race, and I don\u2019t intend to start now \u2013 if I were to do this,\u201d he added. With Elizabeth Warren repeatedly ruling out a potential presidential bid, O\u2019Malley remains perhaps the only credible hope for progressive Democrats seeking an alternative to Clinton. A poll released this week showed only 3% of voters in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state where Clinton will visit starting Monday, supporting the former Maryland governor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
