There were the recent away performances, \u201capart from the Chelsea one\u201d, at Crystal Palace and Wembley. Going back further and Wolves, Saturday\u2019s opponents, had been beaten last autumn in trademark Brighton fashion: plenty of robust defending, a clean sheet and a Glenn Murray finish to claim the points. Then there was Pascal Gross\u2019s return to fitness and that of Jos\u00e9 Izquierdo, players who have missed huge chunks of the campaign. The pair contributed 23 goals and assists last season in a team who scored only 34 times. Throw in, too, the reality Hughton\u2019s side may need to muster only one positive result from five fixtures, starting at Molineux, to secure survival. Cardiff, the team clawing at their backs, will surely need two from four games. It should not be all doom and gloom. \u201cHave we been absolutely brilliant this season? No, we haven\u2019t,\u201d Hughton said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been in a position where, while never comfortable, we\u2019d have been happy. Now we have one last challenge. What I can\u2019t do is fill the players with fear, so I\u2019ve given them the facts. We have five games to go, we\u2019re two points above the relegation zone and we don\u2019t want to rely on other teams. It\u2019s in our hands. The only things that will stop us are if we\u2019re not good enough in the end, or if we don\u2019t work hard enough.\u201d Neither scenario, normally, would seem applicable for a robust, hard-working side who have competed effectively since returning to this level, after 34 years, in 2017, but these are strange times at Brighton. A team who took 25 points from 20 games up to the turn of the year have managed only two league wins since, their nosedive masked by a run to an FA Cup semi-final. Five consecutive defeats in all competitions suggests they may have hit the wall. The crisis of confidence quietly gnawing away at Hughton\u2019s players has been exposed in their past three home games, all surrendered to teams they would expect to beat. The 5-0 drubbing by Bournemouth was humiliating. More damaging still was Tuesday\u2019s reverse to Cardiff when the visitors displayed the cold, calm composure Brighton lack. Senior figures, from Dale Stephens to Lewis Dunk, Murray to Davy Pr\u00f6pper, were paralysed under pressure. It was as if the situation had overwhelmed them. Hughton is well aware of the shortcomings, and of the familiar criticisms being flung his way from the sidelines: the accusations of tactical inflexibility and murmurings that, for all he has achieved over four years, the players may no longer be responding. He suffered a similarly untimely slump at Norwich in 2014, winning twice in 11 games at the same point in the season, and was sacked before a daunting five-match run-in. Norwich subsided with a whimper regardless. Brighton remain horribly reliant on Murray\u2019s goals, and, at 35, he has looked worn out and isolated of late. He has three goals since the beginning of December, and Brighton have not scored in the league for seven weeks. A lack of bite was not quite so critical while they remained stingy at the back, but they have a solitary clean sheet in 12 league games, with Dunk and Shane Duffy not the sources of strength they once were. The latter still flings himself into blocks and tackles but must wonder whether that commitment is being replicated elsewhere. The hierarchy at Brighton, from the owner, Tony Bloom, to the deputy chairman, Paul Barber, via the technical director, Dan Ashworth, remain supportive, and there is no suggestion Hughton\u2019s future will be discussed until the summer at least. Most fans bellowed defiant support at the interval on Tuesday in the hope of stirring a comeback. It was only when that failed to materialise that frustration gave way to boos. Hughton always suspected this would be a tricky campaign. He is partly the victim of raised expectations. Had Brighton begun with eight points from 13 games, a tally similar to those scraped by Burnley, Southampton or Palace, and then recovered like that trio then the panic would have been contained. Instead, their campaign has been played out in reverse. Whether there is scope for Hughton to change things \u2013 the switch from 4-4-1-1 to 4-3-3, forced by Gross\u2019s absence, has not been a success \u2013 is open to debate given the resources at his disposal. Brighton are enduring what so many clubs of their size experience in the elite when forays into the transfer market, always a gamble on their budget, do not yield immediate dividends. They have scoured foreign markets for players of potential. Gross\u2019s signing had been a masterstroke but \u00a33m successes are rare. Alireza Jahanbakhsh, the record signing at \u00a317m having won the Dutch Eredivisie\u2019s golden boot last season, has failed to find the net. J\u00fcrgen Locadia, \u00a314m from PSV, has three goals in 30 top-flight appearances, while Florin Andone has also needed time. Ashworth, who arrived in February, will influence future recruitment but, for now, Hughton must rely on the usual suspects to secure safety. A year ago, they did just that against Manchester United. Now, at Molineux, this team yearn for a repeat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
