Second to Olympiakos in the Greek league last season, Panathinaikos had silenced the crowd as early as the seventh minute with a goal from their Cyprus-born striker Michalis Konstantinou. He let fly from 20 metres with a superb low strike that beat Roberto Bonano inside his left-hand post. That crucial away goal, added to Angelis Basinas's controversial penalty in the first leg last week, left Barcelona knowing they had to score at least three to keep their hopes alive. Fifteen minutes later they were handed a lifeline when Saviola's chipped pass picked out the run of Luis Enrique, who collected the ball on his chest before stretching to prod it low past Antonios Nikopolidis. In the 50th minute Luis Enrique headed home a Rivaldo free-kick for his second, before Saviola took a through ball from Xavi, swept his shot past Nikopolidis and the Catalans breathed a sigh of relief. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
