Here players need to do considerably more than raise a finger before the authorities lift a finger. Take Twitter-based referee abuse: in January top-flight Liverpool's Ryan Babel was fined \u00a310,000 for tweeting a picture of a referee in a Manchester United shirt; over in Brazil widely touted Santos prospect Neymar was fined \u00a35,000 only last week for tweeting that a referee was \"a thief\". On Saturday Watford conceded a late penalty against Leeds and their midfielder Prince Buaben tweeted the admirably no-nonsense: \"absolutely pissed off !!!! fooking robbed us omg nearly hit this focker!!\" This has been strangely absent from back pages, and indeed now from the player's Twitter feed \u2013 deleted and replaced with an apology Arsenal's art of turning players into statues Is it a coincidence that Everton took one look at the newly unveiled sculptures of Arsenal legends Thierry Henry, Tony Adams and Herbert Chapman outside the Emirates and proceeded to defend the winning goal, brilliant as it was in conception and execution, in a manner that can only be described as statuesque? For footballers a trip to China is no crisis So Nicolas Anelka is heading to China, where he will join Shanghai Shenhua's other recent foreign recruit, 32-year-old Australian winger Joel Griffiths, who once made two substitute appearances for Leeds. China, Griffiths said, \"has something special that makes you want to stay for many more things than money\". But the money sure helps. Picture of the weekend Lionel Messi: Real Madrid v Barcelona Messi not only failed to control this ball, he failed even to control himself \u2013 a booking for dissent was followed by a trip on Xabi Alonso. The referee reached for his pocket, then suddenly changed his mind. Is Messi too good to go off? Statistics of the weekend 0 Occasions since 2007 that Manchester United's match has been the last featured on Saturday's Match of the Day. Liverpool got their third taste of that treatment on Saturday. 85 Total number of Premier League clean sheets kept since 30 April, when Blackburn Rovers beat Bolton Wanderers 1-0. The Rovers defence has conceded at least once in every game since. 4 The four Premier League games that Stoke City and Tottenham Hotspur have played at the Britannia Stadium have seen four red cards and three penalties. Every one has finished 2-1 to someone. Meanwhile \u2026 in Melbourne Harry Kewell's summer move to Melbourne Victory came about, of course, because the Australian wanted \"to give something back to the game there\", rather than a desire for the easy life (though Liverpool fans will confirm his love of the latter). Three dire months later Kewell complained last week that the A-League \"is not as easy as everyone made it out to be\". \"I've been hearing for the past six years that it's not like this or that,\" he said. \"I've had a rude awakening \u2013 it's exactly the opposite.\" That's right, it is like this and that. But suddenly he's found his form, shining in the 1-1 draw with Adelaide United at the weekend. \"Having played like Clark Kent, Kewell finally found his phone booth,\" reported The Australian. At Anfield he never shook off the kryptonite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
