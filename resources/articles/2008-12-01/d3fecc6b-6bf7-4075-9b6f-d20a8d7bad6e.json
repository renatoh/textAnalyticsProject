Watson accepted the job in the autumn on a \u00a3150,000 Treasury-approved salary, after Sam Younger quit. A few weeks later, the House of Commons authorities quietly asked if she'd do it for rather a lot less, or they couldn't guarantee that MPs would rubber-stamp her appointment. She duly swallowed her pride and will earn less than her predecessor - ironically, given that Watson is best known for campaigning for equal pay as head of the EOC - although admittedly she'll be doing the job in less time: before the job was advertised it was decided that what had been a full-time post for Younger actually only required three days a week. The Commons vote to approve her appointment, usually a formality, was instead pockmarked with complaints about senior state salaries. The backbencher Ken Purchase suggested that \u00a325,000 a year plus expenses was \"more than enough\" for Watson; the Labour MP David Taylor wanted a re-evaluation of all top salaries in the public sector. The Information Commissioner's \u00a3140,000 salary was also raised. The revolt may simply reflect anger at the Electoral Commission's habit of triggering police investigations into MPs and party funding. Perhaps it's just what happens when the pay of a regulator is determined by the regulated. But there is some evidence of attitudes to the public sector hardening as the recession bites. David Cameron has begun talking about curbing public sector pensions; the Tories hope to tap into envy of what are perceived to be public sector workers' greater job security and perks. (Never mind that decent pensions were traditionally seen as recognising the fact that public sector salaries aren't lavish, and that being an A&amp;E nurse or an inner-city teacher is no picnic.) For now, public sector jobs are expanding still, but the post-recession years of lean public spending could mean serious cutbacks. Even now, state jobs are quietly going, most recently at HM Revenue and Customs and Royal Mail. Some Tories privately speculate that the political taboo on threatening public service cuts could disappear when private sector workers are losing their jobs in swaths and wondering - however unfairly - why state employees don't seem to be taking the same pain. Maybe it's time for public sector workers to mount a more spirited defence of their reputation and their value to the state."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
