Coachella stage Most ardent fan: The man wearing nothing but a pair of scanty swimming trunks and a blue bandana singing along with arms aloft. Although he was later spotted doing the same thing to Florence \u2013 so perhaps his affections are fickle. The context: The Greek/Welsh pop star Marina Diamandis has been chipping away with her brand of idiosyncratic art pop for a few years; and now, about to release her third album, it\u2019s time she made her breakthrough. The highlight: Taking the stage in a poison-green lam\u00e9 trouser suit with a hat shaped like a pair of cherries, Diamandis declares that she\u2019s \u201cas hungover as fuck\u201d. Yet her five-year-old almost-hit Hollywood sounds glorious in the afternoon sun, and selections from her new album Froot prove there\u2019s plenty more where that came from. The lowlight: Forget aims to soar but doesn\u2019t quite get there \u2013 however, it\u2019s all forgotten when Prima Donna goes off like a pop/electro rocket. In summary: The thinking person\u2019s Katy Perry. Florence + the Machine Where? Coachella stage The context: It\u2019s album number three time for Florence, and this is its grand unveiling. No stop is left un-pulled as Florence Welch performs with an enormous band including a horn section, backing singers and harpist, all lined up on a stage boasting a supper-club style mirrored backdrop and multiple floor lamps. The highlight: The climactic Dog Days Are Over sees a new twist on audience participation: Welch asks everyone to hug someone and then remove an item of clothing. The Coachella audience is pretty amenable to the idea - but then they\u2019ve spent the festival half-naked anyway. To encourage them, Welch gamely strips down to her bra. Perhaps more saliently, Welch\u2019s formidable pipes are in full working order. The lowlight: If you like blowsy pop delivered at hurricane velocity you\u2019d have been in hog heaven at this show. The new album is called How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, which Welch tells us \u2013 in a speaking voice which sounds posher than Kate Middleton\u2019s \u2013 is inspired by the Los Angeles sky. Judging by the new songs Welch performs, the album continues in the bombastic vein of its predecessors, with slight tunes blown up like cumulonimbus. It\u2019s all about her voice, which is undeniably impressive, but to my ears too hectoring to love. In summary: It sounds massive, but it\u2019s full of hot air. Drake Where? Coachella stage of course. The context: Drake\u2019s is the show everyone wants to see. For the whole festival bands have been covering his songs; his If You\u2019re Reading This ... album sleeve has been turned into Coachella-themed T-shirts and signs, and the crowd has been anticipating guest appearances that haven\u2019t arrived. Finally, it\u2019s time. The highlight: Well, to get the talking point of the show out of the way, after Drake performed Madonna the woman herself strutted onto the stage, played Human Nature and Hung Up, then slithered over to a seated Drake and kissed him. Unfortunately, Drake looked horrified, and the response in the audience was quite mixed too. The stunt overshadowed the rest of the show. Performed on a strange jungle-themed set; part villain\u2019s lair, part bachelor shag pad, it was a fairly straight canter through the Canadian\u2019s many hits \u2013 though, in the frustrating style almost inevitable at hip-hop shows, many of them were truncated. Yet Started From the Bottom and Hold On, We\u2019re Going Home are undeniable, while Know Yourself has become an anthem in mere weeks. The lowlight: The Madonna incident exposed a slight lack of energy in the rest of the show. Yes, there were fireworks and fake rain, but the passion in the audience often didn\u2019t seem to reach all the way to the distant figure alone on the stage \u2013 well, until Madonna showed up. In summary: The show will be remembered, but probably not for the reasons Drake would have wished."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
