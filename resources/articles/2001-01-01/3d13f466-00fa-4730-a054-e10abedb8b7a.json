There's an old farm cottage up in Snowdonia that I went to stay in to finish the first draft of Grits - I was there for about a week on my own, and in that time I didn't see a soul. The isolation is utter. It's seven miles from the nearest house and it's just completely cut off from anywhere. What's the best thing? I like the height of the mountains and walking around in the open space - the space is so big that it makes you feel big yourself. Some people say that being in such a place makes you feel small, but I think it makes you feel important. At night, the sky is completely black and you can see millions and millions of stars. There's a walk I like to do along what is little more than a sheep track really, but when you get up on to the ridge at the top you can see birds of prey soaring below you. It's one of the most atmospheric places I know. The place is like a drug or a wild animal - and the attraction is irresistible. My perfect day Taking a pad and a pen, a good book and a bottle of whisky, and spending the day there. Ideally, I'd take the time to read something I'd never get round to otherwise - like War and Peace or something. But having said that, every time I take a book up there I never read a word of it - I just end up walking around, taking things in. My advice Take a bottle of whisky with you and take the time to stop and look around you. You'll find that the days fly by - your eyes are always trying to take things in. Getting there Car to the nearest cow grid, then walk. \u0095 Grits and Sheepshagger are published by Jonathan Cape on February 8 at \u00a36,99 and \u00a310 respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
