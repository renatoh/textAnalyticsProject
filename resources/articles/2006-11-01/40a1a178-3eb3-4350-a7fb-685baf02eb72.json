There are no tickets left for days 1-4 at Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Sydney, and days 1-2 are sold out for the Melbourne test. There are some tickets left for the fifth days, from around AU$20 (\u00a38), though there's no guarantee you'll see any action then. Contact the sports grounds via the websites listed on these pages to book. All tickets and packages are also now sold out through Australian Sports Tours (www.astsports.com.au), the official operator for UK fans. However, you can still get package holidays which include match tickets from some major operators. Kuoni Sport Abroad has a good selection - see our competition box on the previous page - and Thomas Cook (0870 752 0149; www.thomascooksport.com) has flight and match ticket only trips and packages available for the final three tests. Thomas Cook's cheapest package option is a 10-night trip to Perth, with 'bronze' tickets to the match, from \u00a32,090. Otherwise, it's a case of scouring the web for spare tickets and packages through unofficial sources. The authorities advise against using operators that aren't Atol-bonded, or buying tickets from Ebay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
