In any case, even a few miles would involve difficult and expensive shuttling between car and plane. Stansted does, however, have frequent train services to more practical garaging areas. You don't say in which direction from Stansted you live, but you could consider Audley End, Cambridge, Ely, March, Bishops Stortford or even Tottenham Hale, all of which have frequent Stansted connectioins. John Batts \u00b7 Motorcycles and scooters can park for free at the entrance to the long stay car park (behind the control building). We have done this many times after driving up from London.
