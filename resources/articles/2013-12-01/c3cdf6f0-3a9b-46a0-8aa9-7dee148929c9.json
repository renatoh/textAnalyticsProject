This Saturday lunchtime a half-full Celtic Park and the appearance of merely a handful of visiting supporters will provide the backdrop to that game. There are mitigating factors: cost, kick-off time, date in the calendar, lingering disappointment at Celtic over a poor showing in the Champions League and the fact Parkhead's visitors' section is just about the least appealing in Scotland. Yet the on-field demise of Hearts, which shows no sign of abating, is also highly pertinent. At any level of football competition is at least a useful pre-requisite. When these teams last met, in Edinburgh for a Scottish Cup tie at the start of this month, Celtic cantered to a 7-0 success. Hearts have won two of their last 15 games: their last victory was in early November. With Hearts still in the process of exiting administration, there is a bigger game in play at Tynecastle. That, to their immense credit, has been overseen successfully by the supporter-backed Foundation of Hearts. It is also unquestionable that Hearts should be punished for the reckless management of not only Vladimir Romanov but those who preceded him. Fortunately the club had a sounder business base than most. Other Scottish clubs that bask in Hearts' troubles \u2013 and plenty do \u2013 generally owe a debt of gratitude to generous individuals or banks. A glance at the balance sheets of Kilmarnock, Hibernian and Aberdeen, for example, hardly paints a picture of glowing fiscal health. There is a question mark not only over what Hearts' situation means for the wounded reputation of the Scottish Premiership \u2013 a league without so much as a title sponsor \u2013 but also for the young players who have been plunged headfirst into this affair. Hearts started this season with a 15- point deduction, which they are still to offset, and a transfer embargo prohibiting the signing of players until the club is no longer run by an administrator. The result, exacerbated by injuries, has been the routine fielding of a team that would be eligible to play in Scotland's U20 league. Should Hearts' threadbare squad suffer two more injuries, players who would be lucky to command places in strong boys' club teams will be thrown into top-flight action. Hearts have three players who are one booking away from a suspension. Gary Locke, Hearts' manager, has handled himself and his young squad exceptionally well. As a club Hearts have accepted all that has been thrown at them without the kind of squealing, blame-passing and agenda-running that went on elsewhere. In his first management job Locke has inherited a set of circumstances at which an experienced coach would balk. He has no other option than to try to keep up the morale of his cohort of battle-weary teenagers. Locke was lied to by the previous board, over a supposed budget in excess of \u00a31m to recruit players, before Romanov's business empire formally collapsed. The development of inexperienced footballers cannot possibly be helped by all of this. Contrary to popular belief, Hearts hardly signed any players at all during the latter part of Romanov's ownership, so by last summer there were precious few players left to fulfil footballing obligations. The SFA was duty-bound to inflict some form of sanction on the club and it is questionable whether any business in administration should be allowed to recruit employees. But less than half way through this season there is clear damage both to the competitiveness of the top league and to a batch of players who could still have plenty to offer the game in the longer term. There will be inevitable comparisons with Rangers' insolvency. None of them is particularly valid and the SFA is well within its rights to treat individual cases on their merits; Dunfermline Athletic, for example, were permitted to sign U21 players when in administration. That age restriction, which has also been used by the Scottish Premier League, is an odd one. It rules out clubs signing out-of-work, older, cheaper players but allows the arrival of young loans from England who might earn thousands of pounds a week. It is astonishing that no club has challenged this anomaly. In 1982-83 Hearts were in Scotland's second tier. Within three years they came within seven minutes of winning the Premier League, re-establishing themselves as a major force in the Scottish game. If, as expected, Hearts are demoted they will bump into Rangers and any combination of Dundee, Falkirk, Dunfermline and Raith Rovers in the Championship next season, rendering it a more intriguing division than the Premiership. Relegation at the end of this campaign would not be the end of the world but it could lead many to ask what the value of the previous 10 months were to Hearts in a purely football sense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
