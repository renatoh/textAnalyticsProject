After waiting the best part of 20 months and 1,297 minutes, he finally had the chance to celebrate a goal. Stockport County's new manager has not indulged in touchline revelry since Steve Lomas scored in Northern Ireland's 4-1 win against Poland in February 2002. That all changed, however, when Aaron Wilbraham capped a free-flowing move with a shot that bent around Notts County's goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall and nestled in the bottom corner. McIlroy leapt from the dug-out, whooped with joy, embraced his assistant Mark Lillis and exchanged high-fives with everyone in touching distance. When Jim Goodwin volleyed home in injury-time, McIlroy did it all again. \"I'd almost forgotten what it felt like,\" he said after Stockport snatched a point from their fellow Second Division strugglers. \"It was tremendous to see two goals go in, but I thought we could have had a few more.\" In truth, however, Stockport were a little lucky to escape a humdrum game with a point. After Darren Caskey cancelled out Wilbraham's opener, Clive Platt seemed to have won the game for Notts County late on. Had Billy Dearden's strikers not been so profligate - particularly Caskey - they would have run out comfortable winners. To their credit, Stockport kept pushing for an equaliser and were rewarded through Goodwin at the death. McIlroy knows the scale of the job ahead. \"The spirit is there and I was pleased with the boys because they kept going. But there is also a bit of naivety to work on. We've got to learn that when we go 1-0 up we have to kill off the opposition. \"At times we played too many long balls and that's not my style. But it will come.\" Man of the match: Aaron Wilbraham (Stockport Co)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
