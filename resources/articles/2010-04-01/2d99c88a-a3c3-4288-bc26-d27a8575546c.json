They have won three of 20 Premiership matches, two fewer than anyone else, and only Newcastle have scored fewer tries. Scrapping for survival was not what Duckworth had in mind when the latest phase of development at Sixways was completed before the start of last season. The ground holds 12,000 spectators and has planning permission for double that number, but the dream is for Heineken Cup rugby rather than the nether world of the Championship. \"It is very disappointing to be in this position,\" Duckworth says. \"We are not dead yet, but even winning our final two matches [at Leeds and at home to Gloucester] would not guarantee survival. It would be a massive setback if we were relegated and we would have to sit down and work out how to get over it. It is refreshing to know that Harlequins and Northampton came back in a big way and Leeds have done well this season but we have very loyal supporters here and we have let them down.\" Duckworth is not used to failure as a businessmen and he will consider ruthless action even if Worcester stay up. The fact that the Warriors, who 20 years ago were effectively playing in the eighth division, have spent six seasons in the top flight offers him little in the way of comfort. Like all the clubs in the Premiership Worcester are operating at a loss with their owner making good the shortfall. \"I thought we would be in the middle of the table this season, in a position to attract players,\" Duckworth says. \"You have to look at the team and the coaching staff for where we are, letting me and everyone down, if not through a lack of effort. Mike Ruddock [the director of rugby] has one year to go on his contract. He has not taken us forward as we would have liked even though we have some very good players here. He is disappointed and he is there in the firing line. \"We had John Brain before and he got us into the Premiership and kept us there for three years. We thought that although we had survived, it had been difficult: were we playing the right sort of rugby and attracting the right players? That is the responsibility of the director of rugby and we felt we needed to move on. We might have made a mistake there, looking back: we were on the crest of getting it right. We will review the situation in the next couple of weeks and ask if we are cracking the problem of moving forward or whether we have to make some changes. That debate has to go on, as Mike knows. We have just got it all wrong in the last couple of seasons.\" Duckworth will not walk away. \"The relegated team will have a parachute payment but I have not looked at having to cut costs because we are not relegated yet. A lot will depend on how our support and sponsorship hold up. Relegation would be a setback but it would not be terminal. I hate to think what the club has cost me and I would not want my wife to know how much. The business is sustainable and if we could regularly get our 12,000 capacity it would work.\" Kai Horstmann, Worcester's long-serving back-rower, believes they will survive. \"We are capable of winning our last two games and we are confident,\" he says. \"Relegation is always at the back of your mind and what drives me on is the fear that we could be threatening the livelihoods of people who work at the club and you see every day, who are not responsible for our position. It is a huge motivating factor and we will throw everything at Leeds. We have talked about the need to stick together and I think there is still a twist to come in the relegation battle.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
