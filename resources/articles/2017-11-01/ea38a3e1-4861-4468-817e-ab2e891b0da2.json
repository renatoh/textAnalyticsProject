Speaking on ABC TV\u2019s Q&amp;A, the shadow assistant minister, Terri Butler, said it was time for the prime minister to act. As several more politicians from both sides remain under a cloud as possible dual citizens, Labor and the Coalition have agreed to new disclosure rules giving politicians until 1 December to put on the record their parentage and that of their parents and grandparents. The Liberal minister for cities and digital innovation, Angus Taylor, acknowledged the ongoing saga was undermining trust in the political system but blamed the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, who he said was \u201chiding dual citizens in the basement\u201d. Butler countered that Labor had \u201cserious professional processes\u2019\u201d in place to verify the citizenship of its candidates and the party had nothing to hide. In a program that flitted between the future of technology and artificial intelligence and the more prosaic world of politics, the panel, who included the particle physicist Brian Cox, sparred over the past, present and future. Taylor denied he had criticised climate science in the past, even when presented with his quotes from speeches in which he had derided the religion of climate change. \u201cI respect the science enormously \u2026 What I don\u2019t respect is the economic modelling, which as been appalling,\u201d he said. When confronted by Butler with his criticism of windfarms, Taylor said he was not in favour of picking technologies and now the Coalition had a policy that allowed the market to pick technologies. Butler also stepped up the attack on the Coalition over its preference deals with One Nation in some seats in Queensland. The Coalition\u2019s relationship with One Nation is likely to play badly in the looming Bennelong byelection, which was prompted by the discovery by the current Liberal member, John Alexander, that he is a dual citizen. Bennelong, which is held by a margin of 9.7%, has a high proportion of voters born overseas, particularly in China. Shara Evans, a futurist, was asked about whether people should be concerned about developments in digital technology and biotechnology. She warned there were dangers for privacy and society when humans were taken out of the mix and machines were able to take actions, using artificial intelligence without human intervention. Technologies such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa were constantly listening and analysing what was said via smartphones, she said, and we could not be confident that this would lead to good outcomes for humans. Cox also stressed the need for moral intervention by humans in future decision making, though he quipped that machines might be more reliable in deciding whether to go to war than having the US president, Donald Trump, in charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
