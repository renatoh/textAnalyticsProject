Nor will anything resembling the basilica of the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur be built one day over the bodies of the fallen redshirts at the Ratchaprasong intersection in Bangkok. If anything celebrates the return of order in Thailand, it will be another shopping mall. But such is liberal democracy's antipathy to, or lingering fear of, revolution that its governing elites assume people have grown out of them, that the concept of political revolt is no longer in their DNA. Thailand's slow-burning political crisis may teach them otherwise. The longer this crisis continues, and the harsher the methods used to contain it, the harder it becomes to characterise solely as a colour-coded clash between two mutually exclusive tribes, the urban and rural poor against an establishment elite of royalists, bureaucrats and military generals. The longer it goes on, the more the fate of 5,000 people, many of them women and children, in their city centre encampment, develops its own dynamic. They are moving out of the shadow of their backer, the ousted oligarch and former premier Thaksin Shinawatra. He is a convenient figure to blame, but the truth is that the protest is beyond his control. After the deaths of another 29 people, all of them civilians, in the last four days of clashes, the mood on both sides of the bamboo and tyre barricades has hardened. One thing is clear: even if Thailand's military-backed government succeeds in wiping this unseemly blot of open dissent from Bangkok's city centre, the country's political order will never be the same. After five years, Thailand's constitutional order, already dislocated by the prospect of its first royal succession in six decades, is facing a crisis of legitimacy that is nationwide. The country's unelected prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, is often described as Eton- and Oxford-educated, as if this confers on him a set of values superior to the ones which have led to 18 actual or attempted military coups since 1933. But having hesitated and attempted to negotiate, he is reverting to type as a Thai establishment figure. His government yesterday rejected a plea from the redshirts for UN-mediated talks, although it has long been clear that Thailand's political system is broken. This was why the International Crisis Group called weeks ago for outside mediation, the winding down of protest and the creation of a government of national unity which would prepare for new elections \u2013 all eminently sensible ways of defusing the crisis and avoiding more civilian bloodshed. Instead, Abhisit appeared to have convinced himself yesterday that if he does not end the six-week occupation of Bangkok's business centre by force, the country would be on the verge of a civil war. It could be anyway. A state of emergency was imposed on five more provinces yesterday, bringing the total to 22 provinces, and whole neighbourhoods in the capital have been designated \"live-fire zones\", a small step, as Human Rights Watch observed, from \"free-fire zones\". In a televised statement hardening the government's stance, Abhisit declared he only had one gear and that was a forward one. There would be no retreat. This is the other face of the man who only a week ago offered to hold early elections this year. As he spoke, thousands more protesters were massing in another district of the capital, and there were signs of unrest spreading to the north and north-east of the country. Thailand is not Burma or China, and a bloodbath would do more than just paralyse south-east Asia's second-largest economy and decimate its tourism. The Thai government cannot shoot its way back to political order and then pretend to hold elections as if nothing had happened. But the signs last night were ominous. Both sides were preparing for a fight to the finish. The government offered safe passage for protesters to leave, but most vowed to stay to the end.
