Last year saw sea ice levels plummet to the second-lowest since records began.\" We should clarify that this figure, supplied by Greenpeace, comes from research into sea ice volume and not the more commonly discussed \"sea ice extent\" or area. The figure was taken from a University of Washington Polar Science Centre's assessment based on computer modelling \u2013 the Panarctic Ice Ocean Modelling and Assimilation System. In \"Brainwaves from a short, sharp shock\" (Discover, New Review) we said: \"According to the most recent statistics available from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 1,300 patients received ECT [electroconvulsive therapy] in the UK in 2006, down from 2,400 in 1999.\" These figures are actually an estimate for a three-month period in 2006, not the whole year, and are for England, not the UK. We were wrong to describe the animal rights group Animal Aid as a charity in \"Racehorses destroyed as recession costs bite\" (News).
