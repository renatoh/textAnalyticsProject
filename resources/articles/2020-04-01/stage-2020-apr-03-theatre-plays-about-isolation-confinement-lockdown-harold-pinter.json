He should be so lucky. A lot of plays in the history of drama deal with self-imposed or enforced isolation. Here are just a few to remind us that our current situation is not without precedent. Sophocles\u2019s Philoctetes (409BC) Spare a thought for Sophocles\u2019s hero. He\u2019s been dumped on the isle of Lemnos for nine years with a festering snake bite that stinks to high heaven \u2013 that\u2019s why the Greeks abandoned him en route for Troy. Mind you, he\u2019s not without company: Odysseus and Neoptolemus turn up to trick him into returning since they need his expertise as an archer. There\u2019s an ironically happy ending, but Sophocles is the first great dramatist to explore the corrosive effect of isolation. John Galsworthy\u2019s Justice (1910) Can plays do any good? This one is often cited because the wordless central scene shows a young clerk, sent to prison for forgery, locked up alone and beating furiously and helplessly on his cell door. Winston Churchill, on his sixth evening as home secretary, went to the first night and was so shocked by what he saw that he changed the law on solitary confinement and ordered that political prisoners, including militant suffragettes, be treated differently from hardened criminals. Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s Huis Clos (1944) \u201cHell is other people,\u201d is the line everyone remembers from Sartre\u2019s tragedy of confinement: one that shows a neurotic pacifist, a female infanticide and a lesbian postal worker locked up together for eternity. Even though dead, the trio seek to destroy each other. But you could argue that Sartre\u2019s gloomy message is contradicted by our current crisis, where isolation is encouraging charity and goodwill. The play\u2019s real pertinence comes from the Beckettian final line, \u201cEh bien, continuons,\u201d as the trio confront an unending fractious co-existence. Harold Pinter\u2019s No Man\u2019s Land (1975) Pinter had several alternative titles for this bleakly brilliant play: A Tomb of Honour, The Last Toast, Closing Time, Night Quartet. All reek of desolation and finality. Yet there is also wit and humour in the play, which shows Spooner, a minor pub-poet, seeking to penetrate the drink-fuelled defences of a self-immured writer, Hirst. There is much comedy in their canter through an imagined past and a strange gallantry about Spooner\u2019s final attempt to rescue Hirst from a permanent entombment. Samuel Beckett\u2019s Footfalls (1976) Beckett was the poet of terminal stages, and all his plays deal, in one way or another, with confinement or solitude. This, however, is one of the most haunting in the way the physical action perfectly embodies the theme. We watch as May, a middle-aged woman, paces relentlessly up and down a narrow strip of stage communing with her bedridden mother whom we hear but do not see. It is both an image of filial servitude and of timeless human suffering. Take May out of her setting, as a production once did by having her roam about the theatre, and Beckett\u2019s vision is shattered. Caryl Churchill\u2019s Imp (2019) Churchill often deals in big social themes but this play \u2013 part of a quartet seen at the Royal Court last September \u2013 had an eerie, claustrophobic resonance. The central image was of a pair of ageing cousins cooped up together in uneasy harmony and bound together by a dark secret. They have a pair of young visitors, but there was an element of the comic-macabre about the relationship between Toby Jones\u2019s depressive Jimmy and Deborah Findlay\u2019s quietly murderous Dot. It says a lot about the play\u2019s suggestive power that you wonder how they would cope with our current enforced lockdown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
