The announcement just before London closed of President Bush's proposed $140bn (\u00a370bn) package to support the flagging US economy immediately sent shares on both sides of the Atlantic into reverse. Bush's opponents cast doubt on whether the president's proposals would be enough to stave off recession. So having been nearly 130 points higher, the FTSE 100 closed down 0.7 points at 5901.7. Financial firms with UK property funds were among the leading fallers, following Scottish Equitable's decision to prevent investors from withdrawing their funds for a year. Protestations from other companies that they had no immediate plans to follow suit were to no avail. So Standard Life lost 14.25p to 211.75p, well below its 230p flotation price, while Prudential fell 37p to 596.5p, and Schroders 60p to \u00a310.19. John Duffield's New Star Asset Management - which said it had more than 20% cash reserves to meet any withdrawal demands from investors - slumped 45.75p to 101.25p as it also issued a profit warning and cut its dividend. Banks were again under pressure as both JP Morgan and Panmure Gordon issued downbeat notes in the wake of the latest write-offs from Merrill Lynch and other major investment banks. Panmure pointed to the possibility of another round of provisions from UK banks, while JP Morgan cut its price targets across the board by 4% (HSBC) to 23% (Alliance &amp; Leicester). It said: \"We argue that UK banks do not offer enough of a discount to the sector.\" Barclays fell 16p to 450p, Royal Bank of Scotland 12.75p to 373.25p, and Alliance &amp; Leicester 4p to 727p. HSBC bucked the trend, edging up 1p to 760.5p. As for the various takeover tales in circulation, the idea of BHP Billiton raising its bid for its rival miner Rio Tinto was the most plausible. BHP has proposed a three-for-one share swap and has until February 6 to make a firm offer. It was said yesterday to be preparing to sweeten the offer by offering 3.58 of its shares, plus about 750p in cash. Rio rose 221p to \u00a347, while BHP was 29p better at \u00a313.78. All this lifted the whole mining sector, which has been in the doldrums in the past few days on fears that any US recession would dent demand for base metals. Helping sentiment was another bit of bid speculation, the suggestion that Brazil's Vale may finally be pressing ahead with its supposed interest in Xstrata, which added 266p to \u00a333.63. Then came a typical piece of Friday flummery. Bhs's owner, Philip Green, was said to be stakebuilding in Marks &amp; Spencer, up 15.25p to 414.5, but he later dismissed the idea as rumour-mongering. Apart from the revival of takeover speculation, which comes after M&amp;S's disappointing Christmas performance, the shares were also lifted by a buy note from Panmure Gordon. The analyst Philip Dorgan put a 500p target on M&amp;S shares and said: \"The company's prospects are not as good as investors thought at 759p, but neither are they as bad as the current share price is discounting. We believe this presents a buying opportunity and a safe way to dip a toe back into the sector.\" Despite a fall in Christmas high-street sales announced yesterday, the rest of the retail sector held up well. Traders said the December figures meant a UK interest rate cut was even more likely. Argos's owner Home Retail Group added 13p to 279.25p, while Kesa Electricals, owner of Comet, closed 16p higher at 217p. Struggling Woolworths slipped 0.08p to 8.72p. Citigroup issued a sell note yesterday, cutting its target price from 12p to 5p and halving its dividend estimate. The bank's analyst Bruce Hubbard said: \"It would be easy to argue for short-term value here but history suggests Woolworths is a structural loser with cyclical pressures on top. Accordingly, we do not think now is the time to fish for value despite the all-too-obvious attractions of \u00a33bn of revenues being valued at \u00a3130m.\" Elsewhere, the London Stock Exchange added 63p to \u00a316.50 as Gordon Brown and Clara Furse opened an office in Beijing, prompting hopes of more Chinese listings in London. The drugs group AstraZeneca added 47p to \u00a323.45. Dealers said the group could benefit from disappointing clinical trial news about Vytorin, a rival to Astra's Crestor cholesterol treatment from Merck and Schering-Plough. The broadcaster ITV was 0.7p better at 72.9p after a buy note from Dresdner Kleinwort. The bank set a 120p target, saying the market was undervaluing ITV's production, cinema advertising and Friends Reunited business as well as its share of Freeview. It said: \"At the current price, the market is valuing all of ITV's separable, saleable non-broadcasting assets at zero. We would value these conservatively at \u00a31.4bn. Even if the UK TV advertising market were to fall 5% in 2008, these assets would still be selling at only 5.9 times 2009's estimated earnings. With most of British Sky Broadcasting's stake likely to be dislodged this year, the return of strategic [buyers] cannot be ruled out at these levels.\" Lower down the market, the fashion group Marchpole rose 5p to 39.5p, after it settled a long-standing licensing dispute with designer Ozwald Boateng. Sole trading There is talk that the shoe retailer Dolcis, which has 65 branches across the country, may go into administration. Alexon, up 0.75p to 73.25p, sold Dolcis in December 2006, but there are some residual liabilities if the worst happens. According to ABN Amro, leases on 15 stores would revert to Alexon. \"In such a scenario,\" said ABN, \"we would expect Alexon to attempt to reach agreement to hand back leases to landlords or sub-let them. But where such agreements are not feasible, we understand the group has drawn up plans to trade residual sites under one of its existing retail brands. The risk to annual profit may be up to \u00a3250,000, so the impact would not be material. [But] there would be the distraction of sorting out the stores returned and the inconvenience of trading sites that it thought it had successfully jettisoned.\" nick.fletcher@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
