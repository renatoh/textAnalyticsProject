Together they permitted Oscar Pereiro to gain half an hour then, and Landis's collapse on the 11-mile climb to the finish here yesterday enabled the Spaniard to regain the yellow jersey he took in Montelimar. Underestimating him looks now to have been a blunder of epic proportions, or at least that is how Pereiro saw it. \"Phonak didn't make a mistake, because they needed other teams to help them,\" he said. \"I think the other teams made a huge error.\" Asked if Pereiro's Caisse d'Epargne team had had a plan to attack yesterday, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Echavarri, who has run the squad since the 1980s and won the Tour five times with Miguel Indur\u00e1in under the Banesto banner, said they had not exactly had a plan but rather a maxim: \"If you leave the tree still, the fruit stays on the branch. If you shake it hard, it may fall.\" Landis came down to earth in spectacular style. At the foot of the climb to the finish the maillot jaune was riding in a 30-strong group and looked as efficient as the day before, but he had not felt good on the earlier climbs and was bluffing. The early \"shaking\" was applied by Denis Menchov, winner at Pla-de-Beret last week, but it was an attack by Carlos Sastre, from just before the banner indicating 10km to go, that did the serious damage. The American's hip replacement is pending but suddenly he seemed to need new legs. He slowed to walking pace, sweat pouring down his face, which had turned almost as yellow as his jersey. He had pulled out the earphone link to his team vehicle, because clearly there was nothing to be said. He lost time at almost a minute per kilometre - the usual rate for a non-climber against a specialist - and he slumped to 11th overall, eight minutes behind Pereiro. \"I don't have an explanation,\" he said, \"but my chances of winning the Tour are very small.\" Nothing on this scale had been seen from a contender for overall victory wearing the yellow jersey since Jan Ullrich's shipwreck in pouring rain a couple of valleys away at Les Deux Alpes in 1998. As Landis floundered, Sastre forged ahead, with Pereiro, Cadel Evans and Andreas Kl\u00f6den pulling clear of the rest, who finished in dribs and drabs. And there was one footnote for those doubting Pereiro's intentions - the Spaniard made sure of winning third place, which carries an 8sec time bonus that might prove decisive in the next few days. After what happened to Landis yesterday it would be foolhardy to make any predictions about Pereiro's chances today, when the Tour travels over five more climbs. They may be less severe than yesterday's two giants but they come on the third day's mountaineering, when cumulative fatigue will be the critical factor. Behind Pereiro the key men now look to be Sastre, who is second at 1min 50sec, Kl\u00f6den and Evans, who are third and fifth at 2min 29sec and 2min 56sec respectively. Barring a dramatic recovery Menchov should be a busted flush at almost four minutes back, while the rider in fourth, France's Cyril Dessel, rode courageously yesterday but is untested at this level. While the yellow jersey still hangs in the balance, the measled mountains vest looks destined for the spindly shoulders of Mickael Rasmussen. The wafer-thin Dane, who took the prize last year, led over all four summits yesterday, including the so-called Roof of the Tour, the Col du Galibier and its nasty neighbour the Croix de Fer, both super-category beasts, to take what should be a decisive lead. In the Pyrenees and at l'Alpe d'Huez Rasmussen's quest to defend his jersey was subordinated to Menchov's to win overall. When he went on the attack yesterday on the slopes of the Galibier, it was a statement by the Rabobank team that Plan B was being implemented after Menchov had cracked at l'Alpe d'Huez. Mountain stages like yesterday's, where the climbing starts early and the winning escape is launched on the first pass, are hotly contested at the back of the race as well as the front. The flat-earth men join forces in the autobus - the best translation given its ironic connotation would be \"charabanc\" - to fight their way to the finish inside the time cut, which is a percentage of the winner's time. At the start yesterday Bradley Wiggins was worried that it would be impossible for the charabanc to beat the cut and he was right: he was among a field of 78 who were outside the initial limit, 44min 1sec behind Rasmussen. However, it was no coincidence that 78 finished together, as the back markers know that if more than a fifth of the field are eliminated the rules provide for an extension of the time limit so that the field is not reduced to ridiculous proportions. As one of the 78 Wiggins remains in the race, as does David Millar, who is looking stronger by the stage and finished 44th yesterday. The Olympic champion is currently negotiating to ride the Tour of Britain which, it was confirmed yesterday, will include the world champion Tom Boonen who quit the Tour on Tuesday. Yesterday was the second time in this Tour the time limit has had to be bent. The first was on Saturday in Montelimar, when Pereiro and his four companions finished so far ahead that they would have eliminated the rest of the field. That both days ended with Pereiro in yellow is only a small coincidence, but one which underlines the bizarre contortions of a race which has not yet said its final word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
