How about - by the time it reaches Britain (rumoured to be in 2008), we'll know whether it's worth buying, or was just the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant of MP3 players? Officially launched (only) in the US on Tuesday, Zune (like the rock band Queen, it has no \"the\") made an inauspicious splash. Touted for its ability to let you share songs wirelessly with other Zuneists, and Microsoft's acceptance that vertical integration (of online store, jukebox software and player, \u00e0 la iPod) is the key in the music player market, flaws nevertheless began popping up like teenage acne. The products site Engadget pronounced baldly that \"Installing the Zune ... sucked\" (read the review here): it crashed repeatedly, demanded their phone number and their Windows Live ID in endless registration screens, insisted the Zune wasn't there, insisted it was a \"guest\", and the jukebox had enough bugs to make it look like Microsoft is a newcomer to this software malarkey. Other reviewers noted that it's a bit larger and heavier than the equivalent iPod, and that what looks like a scroll wheel (which remains Apple's - actually, marketing veep Phil Schiller's - shining contribution to user interface) isn't; it's a four-way button with a circular exterior. The price is no better than Apple's, and the screen, while bigger, has no more pixels. Earlier came Microsoft's acquiescience to the record company Universal, to pay it $1 (52p) for every player sold. Why? Because otherwise Universal wouldn't make its music available to the Zune online store. The carrot: Universal might offer exclusive content to Zune buyers. But what if you don't want Universal's stuff? What if you hate its artists? What if you hate it and its Tony Soprano-style tactics? Among online teens - surely the Zune's intended demographic - this one \"reeked\". Then there's the wireless sharing. Steve Jobs dismissed this: \"It takes forever ... You're much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in [a would-be girlfriend's] ear. Then you're connected with about two feet of headphone cable.\" Steve Ballmer defended it: \"I want to squirt you a picture of my kids. You want to squirt me back a video of your vacation. That's a software experience.\" Which prompted the observation: \"Steve Jobs can make sharing earwax sound sexy. Ballmer can make a digital file transfer sound like something you'd need to clean up after.\" And while we're on \"sharing\": when do you consider a song played? On an iPod, it's when its reached the end of the song; on the Zune, as soon as you start a song. That's because the Zune imposes a strict \"three days or three plays\" rule on songs that have been transferred to other Zunes. But you can only enforce the \"three plays\" rule if you count a song as \"played\" immediately it spins up. This applies even to songs you've recorded yourself. Goodbye, Arctic Monkeys-style buzz around local unsigned bands. And - no, we're not finished, amazingly - then there's the points currency (familiar to Xbox Live users, but nobody else). To buy songs online, you need a currency called \"Microsoft Points\". One song costs 79 points, which cost 99c, but only come in $5 allocations. So you buy one song, and your other $4.01 - umm, 319.989898 ... points ... sit there unused. Meanwhile, Microsoft has your real cash. Of course, Windows 1.0 was pretty rubbish too. By 2010, maybe Zune 3.1 will be worthwhile. By which time iPods will probably fly. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
