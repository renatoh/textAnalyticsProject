Keane's position at Liverpool is again under scrutiny after the manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, left the Republic of Ireland captain on the sidelines during Saturday's 2-2 draw against Hull City. Before the game Ben\u00edtez and the 28-year-old had insisted he had a long-term future at Anfield following reports he could be sold back to Tottenham Hotspur at the first available opportunity. Ben\u00edtez's decision to introduce Nabil El Zhar, Ryan Babel and Lucas ahead of the striker against Hull, however, illustrated the difficulties facing Keane at Anfield. Speaking on The Last Word on Today FM, Lawrenson said he discussed Keane's predicament with Steven Gerrard after the game and claimed the Liverpool captain suspects his team-mate could be sold in the forthcoming transfer window. \"I hate to name drop,\" said Lawrenson, \"but I was having a drink with Gerrard on Saturday and we talked about Keane. They share the same agent [Struan Marshall] and quite honestly he thinks something is going to happen with Keane in January. Sounds like he could be moved on.\" While Marshall declined to comment Liverpool issued a statement last night denying the pundit's version of events. A club spokesman said: \"Mark Lawrenson's remarks are his interpretation of a private chat between the two of them. They do not accurately reflect Steven's opinion of Robbie Keane and they certainly do not tally with Steven's recollection of the conversation itself.\" Lawrenson's assessment of Keane's time at Liverpool did not end with predictions for January, with the former Anfield defender casting doubt on Ben\u00edtez's wisdom in signing the striker to begin with. \"He [Ben\u00edtez] got it wrong. If Liverpool were playing a Champions League final, FA Cup final or a massive game that they had to win tomorrow, you know Keane wouldn't start. He'd not get in the team. Why pay \u00a320m for a player who doesn't suit the formation or system? He's not going to improve at 28. \"You just wonder if Tottenham will come back and do a bit of a deal and Liverpool would go for someone else.\" Owen delays decision, page 3"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
