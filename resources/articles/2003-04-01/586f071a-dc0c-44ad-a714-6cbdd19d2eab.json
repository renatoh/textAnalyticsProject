Bells &amp; whistles: Bristol &amp; West says: 'The bond is one of a handful of products that provide a realistic level of income and use a deposit structure to guarantee the return of investors' capital in full.' Investors can withdraw their money at any time without penalty from the fixed-rate part of the bond. How it works: Half of the investor's capital is placed in a seven-year, fixed-rate bond paying 5.1 per cent gross per month or 5.22 per cent gross annually, while the remainder is invested in a seven-year, guaranteed-equity bond designed to return 70 per cent of the average growth in four stock market indices - the FTSE 100, Nikkei 225, SMI, and S&amp;P 500. The starting level of this index-linked element will be calculated by working out the average of the four indices every month from June this year to June 2004, while the finish point will be calculated using the same process over the final year. Investors can also withdraw money from the index-linked part, but the investment will continue until the original maturity date and pay out whatever returns would have been earned on the original investment, minus a redemption fee. Minimum: \u00a3500. Charges: Built into the return. Tax: The annual or monthly income will be liable to income tax in the year it is paid out. Returns from the index-linked part of the bond will be treated as income in the year of maturity. Risk: Low. Should you buy? John Hutton-Attenborough of independent financial adviser PKF Financial Planning says the bond is too complicated, particularly in its use of four indices. The income return, while good, will seem less generous if the index-linked part fails to make any money. Colin Jackson of Baronworth says investors will like the guaranteed return of their capital, but adds: 'I prefer a guaranteed equity bond on offer from the Zurich. It doesn't pay any income, but it's linked just to the FTSE 100 and you get 100 per cent of any uplift in the index.'
