But look again and you'll see that Leyster's kids are clearly teasing the creature, which in turn wants to devour the eel. What is it about cats that makes them so appealing to humans? In the 18th century, poet Thomas Gray hit on a few details, writing his Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat, after his pet drowned while trying to catch fish: \"Her conscious tail her joy declar'd.\" Meanwhile, in William Hogarth's 1742 portrait The Graham Children, a bright-eyed black and grey cat steals the show, viciously eyeing up a caged bird, like Sylvester pursuing Tweety Pie, as the children pose gaily. We know that, at the time of painting, the baby in the picture was actually dead, so the addition of the cat has got nothing to do with spreading an air of childhood playfulness. It's Hogarth infiltrating his work with mortality \u2013 just as a clock on the mantelpiece is decorated with Cupid holding a scythe. In books, cats tend to be more homely, from Ian McEwan's The Daydreamer (in which a boy imagines entering the being of the family cat) to Judith Kerr's classic Mog picture books for kids (although in Goodbye Mog, the cat dies \u2013 grateful perhaps to be free of all that 1970s furniture). Pop goes straight for the glamorous, nocturnal side of cats, an approach best summed up by the words of Tom Jones: \"What's new, pussycat? Wooah woh woh whoah.\" And cartoons, especially Tom and Jerry, like to make cats look murderously violent, which may be how you feel after seeing the Lloyd Webber musical Cats, inspired by TS Eliot's poems in Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. But there's no doubt cats do make a home. In a sweet 1880s portrait by Edouard Manet of his wife, their pet nestles in her lap. It was called Zizi, and Manet painted it over and over: here is a truly loved pet that loomed large in Manet's life and art. Had the Frenchman ever wanted British citizenship, those pictures would have been something to show a judge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
