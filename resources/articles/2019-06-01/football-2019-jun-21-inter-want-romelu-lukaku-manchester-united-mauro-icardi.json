Icardi is desperate to leave Inter and the new manager, Antonio Conte, would be happy to see the Argentinian depart but there are not that many suitors that would contemplate paying the \u00a360m price tag the club have put on him. Juventus are currently the only club looking at possibly signing Icardi, who was stripped of the Inter captaincy last season. Should Icardi leave, Inter would put all that money into trying to sign Lukaku and believe they have a chance to convince the Belgium striker to join them. Conte was desperate to sign Lukaku when Chelsea manager in the summer of 2017 but the player ended up joining United. Chelsea signed \u00c1lvaro Morata instead but it did not work out for the Spaniard at Chelsea and Conte left the following summer. Lukaku has had an uneven spell at Old Trafford and lost his place at times last season under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. He scored 27 goals in his first season at the club but managed only 15 in 2018-19."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
