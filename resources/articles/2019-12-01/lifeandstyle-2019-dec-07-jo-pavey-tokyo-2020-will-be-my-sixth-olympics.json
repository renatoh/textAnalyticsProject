When London was awarded the Olympics in 2005, I remember thinking, \u201cWhat a shame! I\u2019ll be long retired by 2012.\u201d I\u2019m planning to train hard for Tokyo 2020, which will be my sixth Olympics. I\u2019m very motivated, but it depends if my body can hold up. I didn\u2019t realise I could be an international athlete until after university. I\u2019d won at the English Schools, but I was nowhere near as fast as the seniors. I remember watching others on TV and thinking: \u201cHow can they run that fast?\u201d My husband is my coach. We met at Exeter Harriers while I was working as a physiotherapist in Bath. I was too embarrassed to say to my colleagues: \u201cI\u2019m giving up my job to become an athlete,\u201d so we dressed it up as a backpacking adventure. I ran up hills in Sydney and down volcanoes in Hawaii. When we got back, I was a bit rusty at running on a track, but I did reach the semi-finals at the 1997 World Championships in Athens. I\u2019ve never had to have a poo during an actual event. As a runner, you get used to going to the toilet behind a tree or bush during training. You might have had something unsettling for breakfast or a curry the night before. But you tend to prepare nutritionally before a big event. My contract with Nike was frozen when I was pregnant. I still did some appearances for the brand in the hope it would start again... I didn\u2019t make a big deal of it at the time. It definitely wasn\u2019t sending the right message to female athletes. It was great to hear someone was able to enter this year\u2019s Great North Run as gender neutral. The problem is that at world championship level, a transgender athlete who competes in a female race would have an obvious physical advantage. Sports should be inclusive to all. It just makes things difficult at an Olympic level. I\u2019ve met the Queen a couple of times. The first time was after Sydney 2000. They were very generous with the drinks at the Palace. They just kept topping us up. By the time the Queen got to me, I\u2019d had a few and said: \u201cWhat a lovely house you\u2019ve got!\u201d She was really nice and thought it was funny. My kids would beat me in a race if it were over 10m. They can go from stationary to bolting with no warm up. My son Jacob is 10 and my daughter Emily is six. They just leg it and I then try to catch up. I\u2019d still beat them over a longer distance though \u2013 I hope!
