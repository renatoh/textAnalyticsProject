This is the first of the two semi-finals broadcast live from D\u00fcsseldorf this week, with performers from 19 of the 43 countries take part \u2013 the ones without a guaranteed passage to the final \u2013 to compete for a place in next Saturday's spectacular. Blue, the UK's entry, are special guests, and there's a chance for viewers to vote on who gets through. Eleanor Morgan The Viking Sagas 9pm, BBC4 Even if you can't get over the devastating news that Vikings didn't wear horned helmets all the time, there's still plenty of interesting stuff here. Dr Janina Ramirez, an expert on historic symbols and art, travels to the frosty north to explore the Laxdaela saga \u2013 one of the most famous of the centuries-spanning epic folk tales of the region. While perhaps best known for their excellence in the fields of rape and pillage, the Laxdaela tells an epic, often romantic tale of power struggles, conquest and hornless-helmeted intrigue. Phelim O'Neill Bombed But Not Broken \u2013 House Of Commons 11pm, BBC Parliament The Luftwaffe's bombardment of London peaked 70 years ago this week. Among the casualties was the chamber of the House Of Commons, forcing parliamentarians to debate the rest of the war's progress in temporary premises. This film recalls the process of rebuilding the heart of Britain's democracy \u2013 a task with immense symbolic as well as practical significance. Archive footage and informed interviews further illuminate the story, but none more so than Churchill's contemporary observation: \"We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.\" Andrew Mueller The Apprentice 9pm, BBC1 Thanks to the delayed airing of series six, it's already time for a new Apprentice, and this time, the stakes are . . . a bit different. Lord Alan has changed the prize from a job with his company to a \u00a3250,000 one-off investment for the winner to start his or her own business, with Sugar as partner. This means the candidates are even more ruthless, if possible. Tonight we meet the sharp-suited wannabes, before they're split into teams and given \u00a3250 to turn fruit and veg into cold hard profit. Rebecca Nicholson The Country House Revealed 9pm, BBC2 Architectural historian Dan Cruickshank traces the history of Britain's country houses via six rarely explored homes that are still in private hands. He begins with South Wraxall Manor, in Wiltshire, built by the Long family. Descended from cattle thieves, the Longs did some serious social climbing in the Tudor era to become friends of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. Cruickshank tells the story of a frequently brutal clan with gusto, but it's the house that lingers in the mind's eye. Jonathan Wright Home Is Where The Heart Is 9pm, ITV1 Four celebrity households. Four vulnerable homeless people. On the surface, ITV's latest social experiment \u2013 putting rough sleepers in celebrity digs for two weeks \u2013 is likely to make plenty of viewers cringe: it's tacky, insensitive, and without practical merit. In reality, on television, with cynicism suspended, it can be genuinely, lump-in-throat touching. Sure, Alex James will test every bit of Blur fandom you cling to and Anneka Rice's hippy bohemia might wear thin. But, where chef Aldo Zilli keeps it real, it's property TV types Colin and Justin who prove that dubious programme-making can sometimes have a real point.
