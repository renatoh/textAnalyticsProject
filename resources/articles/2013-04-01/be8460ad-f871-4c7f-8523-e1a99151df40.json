Fayyad offered his resignation last week, and it was accepted on Saturday evening by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Relations between the two have been strained for some time, with Abbas threatening to sack Fayyad. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, who is engaged in a drive to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations after more than two and a half years of deadlock, was reported to have telephoned Abbas to urge him to keep Fayyad in office. The Americans have praised Fayyad's commitment to building the foundations and institutions of a future Palestinian state and his stance against corruption. The international community views his moderate politics as a desirable and stabilising influence amid the warring Palestinian factions. Fayyad, 61, offered his resignation on Thursday. A planned meeting with Abbas for that evening was called off without explanation. According to reports, Abbas came under heavy pressure from the US and some European governments to reject Fayyad's resignation. A statement from the office of the Palestinian president said: \"Abbas informed Fayyad that he has accepted his resignation,\" adding that Fayyad had been asked to head a caretaker administration until the establishment of a new government. Abbas is expected to name a new prime minister in the next few days. The immediate trigger for the crisis appears to be Fayyad's acceptance last month of the resignation of the finance minister, Nabil Kassis, an Abbas protege. However, the Palestinian Authority has been in financial crisis for months, with public servants unpaid and protests over price rises and taxes. Fayyad was attacked by both dominant Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas. A former World Bank economist, Fayyad was appointed by a presidential executive order in 2007 following the collapse of the Palestinian national unity government and Hamas taking control of the Gaza Strip. While he was one of the few senior politicians to frequently visit marginalised communities and ask after their concerns, tax and commodity price hikes repeatedly stoked angry street protests against him. Palestinian unemployment has risen to almost 25% and real GDP growth is set to fall from an average of 11% in 2010-11 to just 5% in 2013, according to the World Bank."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
