As the president carried out his visit, news emerged of two additional campus shootings on Friday, in Arizona and Texas. In brief public remarks following an hour-long meeting with the families at Roseburg high school, Obama said the US had to figure out a way to stop mass shootings from happening. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously got very strong feelings about this,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to come together as a country, but today is about the families.\u201d The president was greeted upon his arrival in Roseburg by protesters holding signs reading \u201cgun free zones = kill zones\u201d, \u201cObama is wrong\u201d and \u201cPlease leave us in peace\u201d. Others held signs welcoming the president. The protesters said they opposed the timing of the president\u2019s visit amid reports that he would seek to impose new \u2013 if limited \u2013 restrictions on gun sales in the wake of the Oregon shooting. The White House signaled on Thursday that Obama may take executive action to require private dealers who sell a significant number of firearms to conduct background checks on buyers. Currently only dealers officially certified as \u201cengaged in business\u201d of firearms sales need conduct such checks. No such measure would have provided a safeguard in the Oregon shooting, in which a gunman killed nine people on campus on 1 October and injured nine others before taking his own life. The gunman, Chris Harper Mercer, had no criminal record and had passed background checks to amass an arsenal of 13 weapons. After meeting with families in Roseburg, Obama was scheduled to fly to Seattle for a fundraiser. Hunting is popular in Oregon, a state with relatively liberal gun laws. Permits are required to carry a handgun (but not rifles or shotguns), and firearms may be carried in restaurants, according to the National Rifle Association. On Friday one protester, Jason Harju, bristled when speaking of the press conference Obama held shortly after the Umpqua community college shootings. The community had been reeling in shock, he said. The bodies had not been buried. But the president was already pushing his agenda. Obama did not speak address the protesters in Roseburg, but Harju took the day off from work, strapped his .40-caliber pistol to his belt buckle, hopped in a rig with the sticker \u201cOregunian\u201d on the back window and joined hundreds of other protesters. \u201cHe\u2019s not welcome to politicize our tragedy for his agenda,\u201d Harju said. \u201cWe all know what that agenda is: gun control.\u201d Like many of those who peacefully protested outside the tiny airport where the president\u2019s helicopter touched down, Harju said stricter gun control laws would only hurt law-abiding citizens. \u201cSpend more money on mental health,\u201d Harju said. \u201cThat guy [the gunman] was obviously a nutcase.\u201d Jan Cuddy, whose three daughters graduated from the community college, said she would like to believe Obama visited Roseburg because he was compassionate. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the case,\u201d said the 64-year-old. \u201cThe minute it happened, he was on the news, he made it political. The families don\u2019t need it.\u201d Cuddy held a sign that said: \u201cI\u201dm a Christian. Why didn\u2019t God stop the shooting? How could he? He is not allowed in school anymore.\u201d Heather Sherman, who overheard Cuddy, quietly disagreed. The 34-year-old said the shooting in her hometown prompted her to apply for a concealed weapons permit. \u201cThe president is here for the families,\u201d she said. \u201cI may not agree, about gun control, but he\u2019s here to support Roseburg.\u201d Counter-protesters, meanwhile, argued that the town should welcome the president, whatever the politics of his message. As the president was flying to Oregon, news broke of a shooting at Texas Southern University in Houston, with one dead. It appeared to be the third shooting \u2013 and first fatal shooting \u2013 on that campus since 27 August. Earlier on Friday, an 18-year-old student killed one person and wounded three others when he opened fire during a confrontation on the campus of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
