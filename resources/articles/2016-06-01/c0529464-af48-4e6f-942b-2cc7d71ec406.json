The Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) has detailed the projected impact of those measures on the government\u2019s budget estimates over the next four years, listing every Abbott-Hockey policy that remains stuck in the Senate. Labor said it would reveal on Friday which of those measures it would and would not oppose. The measures it committed to reversing would be removed from the bottom line of Labor\u2019s budget calculations, a party spokesman said. \u201cThis will mean the government\u2019s budget contains unlegislated zombie measures, but ours will not \u2013 our budget bottom line will be more credible and believable than theirs,\u201d the spokesman said. Labor also planned to release on Friday a \u201csubstantial package\u201d of new savings measures that it said would improve its budget bottom line. \u201cWe will announce some new measures that better target family payments, while protecting those who need support the most,\u201d the spokesman said. The PBO report shows the number and value of measures that have been included in the Turnbull government\u2019s budget but which have not passed the Senate. Over four years, the value of those savings measures is $8bn, but that increases to $33.8bn by 2026-27. Greens Treasury spokesman Adam Bandt said the PBO report showed the government was incorrectly banking $33.8bn of savings over 10 years. The measures had failed to pass the Senate for a reason, and now was not the time for \u201cunaffordable tax cuts to big business\u201d as the government was proposing, he said. \u201cThe PBO report ... reveals that the government\u2019s banking of $33.8bn in savings is pure fantasy,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cThe Senate has rightly blocked the Tony Abbott-era cuts to Australian families and universities so the government\u2019s claimed $33.8bn in savings are just not there.\u201d \u201cThe government\u2019s big business tax cuts would see us lose $51.1bn in revenue over the next 10 years and mean the projected return to surplus never sees the light of day,\u201d he said. Two weeks ago, the Coalition criticised Labor\u2019s election spending plans by claiming it had a \u201c$67bn black hole\u201d. The attack caused Labor to dump $8bn worth of spending commitments over four years \u2013 the Schoolkids bonus and the pension assets test. But the Coalition later admitted that Labor\u2019s black hole could be anywhere between $21bn and $67bn, with the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, saying he would let the media \u201cdo a running tally\u201d on the real size of the black hole. \u201cI said it was up to $67bn. I\u2019m not making an estimate now other than to say it\u2019s up to $67bn,\u201d Morrison said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
