White, a former president of the Rugby Football League who is also on the four-man implementation committee currently reorganising the game's central administration, has kept the club going out of his own pocket for the past two years. But now he claims that criticism from Swinton's dwindling band of supporters is driving him away. \"I have been putting far too much money into the club, in fact more than has been coming through the turnstiles,\" White said. \"I'm meeting the other members of the board on Wednesday morning. I'm fed up with the fans who keep harping on. They keep saying there's people out there who will come in if I step down, so I thought I would give them the opportunity.\" But White and Tony Barrow, Swinton's chief executive, have both expressed doubts about whether the club could see out the season without his financial support. Swinton have lost all four of their matches in the Northern Ford Premiership, and last Wednesday's Challenge Cup tie against the Hull amateur club Skirlaugh was watched by only 206 at Gigg Lane, where the Lions have been tenants of Bury FC since 1991. They won the championship twice in the 60s, but have been in steep decline since financial problems forced them to sell their Station Road ground and move to Bury. Another struggling Premiership club, Gateshead Thunder, have insisted that their future is not under threat even though their coach Andy Kelly and all their senior players will today be released from their contracts. They will now rely on the local youngsters who form their under-19 Academy team. But Steve Worsnop, who has been chairman since the Thunder were re-established last season after the original club lasted a single year in the Super League in 1999, said: \"We were heading down a very dangerous route, and the club was just not financially viable.\" Sean Long, St Helens' Great Britain scrum-half, will make a comeback as Saints launch their defence of the Challenge Cup against Oldham in Stalybridge next Sunday. It will be Long's first appearance since he ruptured knee ligaments in a Super League game at Huddersfield last May. Robbie Paul will definitely be fit to lead Bradford against Leeds in one of Saturday's televised ties, despite trapping a nerve in his neck in Friday night's World Club Challenge victory over Newcastle Knights. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
