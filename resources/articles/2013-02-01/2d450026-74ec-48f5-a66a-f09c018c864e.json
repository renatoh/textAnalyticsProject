Barely three months ago he would have anticipated the 2013 tour squad in Australia featuring a handful of mad dog Englishmen amid a cluster of cultured Celts. Increasingly it is a different story, particularly if England maintain their momentum in the Six Nations. On current form there could yet be an entire team of red rose players wearing the red of Britain and Ireland rather than touring Argentina with their national side. Chris Robshaw, Tom Wood, Dan Cole, Joe Launchbury, Ben Youngs and Owen Farrell must already be nailed on, despite England's failure to defeat the Wallabies last autumn. Ben Morgan, Geoff Parling, Dylan Hartley, Alex Goode, Manu Tuilagi and Mike Brown must be extremely close, with Joe Marler, Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, James Haskell, Danny Care, Freddie Burns, Billy Twelvetrees, Brad Barritt and Chris Ashton only a couple of big games away from forcing Gatland's hand. Lob in other candidates such as the injured Tom Croft, Alex Corbisiero and Ben Foden, plus the French-based trio of Andrew Sheridan, Jonny Wilkinson and Steffon Armitage, and the flag of St George is likely to be more prominent than previously thought. Lions selection is not about parochialism, as Gatland well knows. Beating Australia is all that matters. He cannot pick on historical or sentimental lines. The key is to assemble a squad that stays cool under screeching pressure, is not inclined to believe its own hype, has a good record in big games away from home, contains some unifying characters, and boasts high levels of fitness. Few would disagree that England increasingly tick all five of those boxes. That leaves Gatland in something of a quandary. Take full-back, for example. For much of the past year Rob Kearney, Leigh Halfpenny and Foden have been the main names in the frame. Halfpenny is still there but the other two have been handicapped by back and ankle trouble respectively. Most people would still want the outstanding Kearney in their squad but Goode, Brown, Scotland's Stuart Hogg and the Welsh pair Lee Byrne and Liam Williams all have their plus points. If Halfpenny goes as a full-back/wing it means only two others can be picked. Should neither Goode nor Brown make the flight, it will fly in the face of a growing body of Premiership and international evidence. Wing is another interesting situation. George North's fine match-clinching finish for Wales against France is further reason to assume he will travel, with Tim Visser's sharp finishing for Scotland also unlikely to go unnoticed. Gatland would presumably love to name Ireland's Tommy Bowe, even on one knee, and the electric Simon Zebo in the squad when it is announced on 30 April \u2013 even if the latter will only recently have returned after recovering from a broken foot. But if he does so, that would mean leaving behind Alex Cuthbert, Sean Maitland, Craig Gilroy, Andrew Trimble and, potentially, Ashton. Tough calls abound. Toughest of the lot, arguably, will be the back row. For months it has been assumed that Sam Warburton and Stephen Ferris will be high-profile Lions this summer. Form and fitness, though, are threatening to intervene significantly. Robshaw, Wood and Morgan, the back-row trio who helped England see off the All Blacks in December, have all lodged outstanding claims. Jamie Heaslip, widely regarded as a possible captain, had a stinker at the Aviva Stadium against England, while Peter O'Mahony, Ryan Jones, Justin Tipuric, Haskell and Kelly Brown are all mounting genuine challenges. It is reaching the stage where Gatland's options are mushrooming rather than crystallising. In some ways this is a bonus. There is absolutely no value in selecting a past-it, complacent bunch of crocks. The flip side, with the Lions' preparation time so limited, is that the tour management would ideally love to pick some established units to save themselves a bit of time. As Farrell's stock grows \u2013 and remember his father is among the coaching staff for the Lions \u2013 the notion of picking players around him with whom he is comfortable such as Youngs, Twelvetrees and Barritt becomes ever more attractive. And then there is the captaincy. Even as Gatland passed on his congratulations to Brian O'Driscoll and his wife Amy on the birth of their first child at the weekend, the coach will know the appointment of Lions captain remains a tricky call. Who knows, Ireland's supreme centre may find changing nappies so rewarding that seven weeks away from home ceases to exert quite the same magnetic pull on his battered body? Unlikely, to be fair, but possible. In the meantime Robshaw's unselfish contribution to England's gathering momentum grows ever more influential. If England are still atop the Six Nations championship table with a 100% record at the end of the season, the Harlequin will be harder still to ignore. The next five weeks, from a Lions perspective if nothing else, promise to be fascinating and revealing. Level playing fields So why were there 16 tries in week one of the Six Nations and only six in week two? Look no further than the surfaces upon which the games were played, particularly in Paris. The Stade de France pitch was as bad as any of the shifting horrors served up at the Millennium Stadium in its bad old days; we may be reaching the stage where the tournament organisers start doling out fines to countries who are unable to provide an acceptable pitch for games of such magnitude. Wales are already looking closely at the option of artificial turf, with Saracens due to stage their first Premiership game on their new 4G surface in Hendon this Sunday. Wet weather will always complicate groundsmen's jobs but the Parisian parc keeper needs to up his game significantly. As do Les Bleus, of course. \"From cockerel to donkey'\" was the pithy headline in L'Equipe; it is mighty hard to disagree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
