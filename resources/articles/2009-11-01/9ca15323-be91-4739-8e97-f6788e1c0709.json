This club is intent upon making a prolonged impact in the domestic title race but enters Sunday's collision with Chelsea shorn of one key defender and with concerns lingering over another. Cuts, bruises and a fracture tempered this occasion. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is not blessed with great depth in quality across his back-line and there was relief that William Gallas, crunched early by Dieudonne Mbokani and then dizzied after a clash of heads with Andrey Arshavin, is rated only doubtful rather than unavailable for the weekend. The prognosis is grimmer for Kieran Gibbs, whose first metatarsal in his left foot was snapped in a horrible challenge from Eliaquim Mangala, who had already been booked but avoided further punishment. The full-back, who escaped with bruising on the other foot whilst playing for England Under-21s in Lithuania this month, will undergo surgery today and faces up to three months out. He had been excellent here and the fracture is a cruel blow, particularly while the youngster still harbours hopes of making Fabio Capello's World Cup squad. For Arsenal, his loss is all the more demoralising because Ga\u00ebl Clichy, the first-choice left-back, is still recovering from a back problem and three weeks from a return. \"Gibbs has a big hole in his leg,\" Wenger said. \"It was a very bad challenge from Mangala, and it was not his first try. Unfortunately. Gallas is more hopeful, though he has an ankle problem and a swollen eye.\" Mika\u00ebl Silvestre or the raw Armand Traor\u00e9 can deputise at left-back, though the prospect of confronting Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka without Gallas, arguably his most consistent centre-half, would have Wenger fretting all week. The fact that the France international was apparently not concussed should be considered a bonus. \"But he couldn't see any more because his eye was so swollen,\" Wenger said. This defence will want to be able to see Drogba &amp; Co coming. The extra day of recovery may be needed given that Arshavin, outstanding with Cesc F\u00e1bregas during a gloriously fluid first-half display, ended with staples in a head wound suffered in the clash with Gallas. Mehdi Carcela-Gonz\u00e1lez might have inflicted more damage four minutes from time, thrusting his forehead at F\u00e1bregas as frustration took over. The Spaniard escaped unscathed, but his assailant was dismissed and later described by his manager, Laszlo Boloni, as having displayed \"a complete lack of respect\". The football itself was scintillating at times. Li\u00e8ge struck the woodwork twice through Mbokani and Gohi Bi Cyriac, and should have scored through Axel Witsel's close-range attempt, but were always playing catch-up having been overwhelmed in the opening period. Profligacy spared them a thrashing. As it was, Landry Mulemo's slip allowed Samir Nasri to convert Thomas Vermaelen's punt to ease the hosts ahead with Den\u00edlson, starting for the first time since mid-September, striking a brilliant second in first-half stoppage time that dipped from 30 yards through Sinan Bolat's attempt to save. At times Arsenal had been breathtaking, a blur of passing and movement to leave the Belgians gasping. Alex Song and Nasri had set the tone early on only for Felipe to block Carlos Vela's attempt. Both Arshavin and F\u00e1bregas later arrowed shots agonisingly wide of the post. In one frantic rat-a-tat, Bolat denied Arshavin and Gallas from close range, Vela struck a post before Vermaelen's attempt was inadvertently diverted wide by the Russian playmaker on the goalline. The goals plundered thereafter secured the tie, the group and qualification with the tempo dipping accordingly. Theo Walcott enjoyed a half-hour cameo, though thoughts were already drifting towards Sunday. \"It was important to win this game well with Chelsea in mind,\" Wenger said. How he must wish he had not been left with casualties cluttering his treatment room as well as progress into the knockout phase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
