Charlton did what no side has done since Southampton on 28 December 2010 \u2013 they beat Huddersfield Town in the league. Yann Kermorgant and Hogan Ephraim ensured the record-breaking run of Lee Clark's side came to an end at the 44th time of asking. The Football League record is theirs, having eclipsed Nottingham Forest's 42-game unbeaten streak under Brian Clough in 1977-78, but Huddersfield fell six games short of the overall English record \u2013 the 49-game run of Arsenal's Invincibles in 2003 and 2004 remains the mark to beat \u2013 and, it seems fair to point out, their entry in the history books will have to carry an asterisk pointing out the defeat by Peterborough in the League One play-off final in May. Still this game was about more than record runs and the Terriers' place in the annals. For all their previous invincibility Huddersfield now trail Charlton by eight points in League One and remain third behind second-placed Sheffield Wednesday. Town have experienced too much play-off pain over the past few seasons to place too much importance in anything other than a top-two finish and as such the crucial ground lost will mean more than the breaking of their streak. Clark, who spoke movingly post-match of a \"surreal\" couple of days following the death of his friend Gary Speed, a former team-mate at Newcastle, described the result as a wake-up call for his side but shook off the suggestion that a two-week break offered his side a handy space to pick themselves up. \"No chance,\" he said. \"I'd love to have a game tomorrow.\" Charlton have taken the Terriers' mantle \u2013 they are now very much the team to beat in League One. They have won six on the bounce, scoring 17 goals in the process, and are seven points clear at the summit. \"For us to be the ones who have stopped the record is pleasing for us as a club,\" said their manager, Chris Powell. \"Maybe people will remember us now as the team that stopped Huddersfield.\" His side were ahead midway through the first half, Danny Green's inswinging free-kick superbly flicked home by Kermorgant. The goal, a touch against the run of play, galvanised Charlton and they were two up before half-time. Kermorgant flicked on Green's quick throw-in, Bradley Wright-Phillips was denied by Ian Bennett but Ephraim, making his home debut on loan from QPR, coolly slotted home. The home fans wasted no time in informing their counterparts in the away end exactly where they could stick their record. Kermorgant, bombed out of Leicester City following his failed \"panenka\" penalty attempt in the Foxes' shoot-out defeat by Cardiff in the 2010 Championship play-offs, proved the difference between the sides and almost doubled his tally seconds into the second half. From a long throw the Charlton striker was handed the freedom of the penalty area by the Huddersfield backline but could only head on to the bar. Gradually Huddersfield began to assert themselves \u2013 Peter Clarke nodded over from a corner, the substitute Danny Ward zipped a cross on to the bar and lashed a shot wide and, with 15 minutes to go, Ben Hamer did well to tip Jon Parkin's volley on to the post, but that was as close as Huddersfield came. Powell was left to sum up both managers' outlook for the season. \"We're not thinking about records,\" he said. \"We're thinking about points.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
