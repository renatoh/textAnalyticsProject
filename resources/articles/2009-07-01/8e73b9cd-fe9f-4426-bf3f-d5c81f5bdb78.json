The jaunt is part of an advertisement for Sure Men Sport, in which Flintoff overcomes the theft of his car by a group of Australians to pedalo his way to an Ashes Test \u2013 although pedants will note his destination is Old Trafford, one of the venues furious to have missed out on this year's rota after Cardiff outbid them. The pedalo will be auctioned to raise money for Flintoff's own AF Foundation, a charity aimed at improving child rehab and physiotherapy units. Tweet indiscretion The Twitter revolution continues apace with news that Henry Blofeld, Test Match Special's resident plum, has joined. Blofeld quickly declared the umpires Rudi Koertzen, who yesterday became the first official after Steve Bucknor to stand in 100 Test matches, and Billy Doctrove \"two of the worst\" before lavishing praise on TMS's assistant producer Shilpa Patel: \"Divine in white, a cross between Mrs Gabriel, the wife of the Archangel, and Cleopatra.\" Patel's reaction? \"I'll kill him!\" Typecast Fans arriving via St John's Wood High Street may have noticed stencils on the pavement declaring: \"England has history, Australia has previous.\" The legend is the work of the brewery Marston's, an England sponsor. Other slogans include: \"We have beer in our blood. Australians have lemon juice in their hair\", and: \"We're English, we brew beer. You're Australia, you serve it.\" Princely disdain Prince Philip was at his tactful best recently. \"I never listen to you lot,\" he reportedly told the TMS commentator Jonathan Agnew at a pre-Lord's function. \"It takes about 10 minutes to get the score.\" Shafayat silenced Bilal Shafayat's claim that he has been told not to talk about the \n<a>time\u2011wasting antics in Cardiff on Sunday evening came as no news to Gary Pratt, England's previous 12th man cause celebre. \"You weren't allowed to talk about it,\" says Pratt, who ran out Ricky Ponting at Trent Bridge in 2005 but was alleged by the tourists to be part of an English dirty-tricks campaign to substitute tired fast bowlers with ace fielders. \"The media men told us to keep quiet.\"</a>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
