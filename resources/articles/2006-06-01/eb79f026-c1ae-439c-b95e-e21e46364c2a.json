A joint US-Iraqi force found the bodies of Privates Thomas Lowell Tucker, 25, and Kristian Menchaca, 23, dumped at an electrical plant. The recovery of their bodies was delayed by having to defuse bombs planted nearby. Although US officials declined to elaborate on how they had died, an Iraqi defence ministry official said they were killed \"in a barbaric way\" and their bodies bore signs of torture. An internet statement in the name of the mujahideen shura council - an umbrella group for insurgents - said the new leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, had slit their throats. News of the deaths came as a senior British officer warned security was deteriorating in Basra. Painting a gloomy picture of British-controlled southern Iraq, Lieutenant General Nick Houghton, Britain's chief of joint operations, told the Commons defence committee: \"There is a worrying amount of violence and murder carried out between rival Shia factions. \"The security situation in Basra has no doubt got worse of late due to the protracted talks to form the government.\" That, he said, had allowed \"a period of time in which politics that should have been conducted more appropriately, actually were conducted through violent means on the streets\". His downbeat assessment was echoed by the armed forces minister, Adam Ingram. \"I am conscious of the fact that the first time I visited Iraq, I was on the streets with our soldiers in soft hats, no body armour. I don't think that could happen now,\" he said. Britain has 7,200 troops in Iraq, most of them in or around Basra. The remarks contrast with comments recently by the prime minister, Tony Blair. Gen Houghton made clear that the British army's main hope in Basra was the new Iraqi national army and police force taking the lead responsiblity for maintaining security by the end of the year. He said it would be \"some time\" before Britain give up responsibility for defending oil exports and trade outlets and that provincial elections, planned for summer, would probably be delayed until autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
