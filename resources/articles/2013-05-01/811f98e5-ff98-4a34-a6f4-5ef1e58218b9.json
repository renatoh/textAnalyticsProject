A total of 13 arrests for offences ranging from racially aggravated criminal damage to violent disorder were made on Monday during the protests near Downing Street and during subsequent disorder in central London. Of the other nine people arrested, five were released with no charge while four were taken into custody and subsequently bailed, pending further investigations. The Metropolitan police, which said that it was appealing for anyone with information that could help with its investigations, added that a number of people involved in the protests were arrested for anti-social behaviour in Leicester Square. A 48-year-old man who was arrested in Whitehall was charged with possession of a bladed article. Of the other three who were charged, all had been arrested in Leicester Square. They consisted of two men, aged 24 and 45, who were charged under the Public Order Act, and a 20-year-old who was charged with possession of class A drugs. More than 1,000 supporters of the EDL assembled under tight police security close to the entrance to Downing Street, where they listened to their leaders blame Islam for the killing in Woolwich last week of Drummer Lee Rigby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
