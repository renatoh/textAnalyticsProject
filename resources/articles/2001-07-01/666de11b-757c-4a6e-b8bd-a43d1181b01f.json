Now virtually retired, the current world-record holder in the 400 and 200 metres sees no clear signs of a successor but believes experience could count for an awful lot. 'There are probably 12, 14 guys right now in the 400 who could be the next to be on top in that event,' said Johnson. 'But don't rule out Antonio Pettigrew. He's been around for so long and knows what it takes to be successful.' The 33-year-old Pettigrew, like Johnson is winding his career down, but at the United States championships in Eugene, Oregon last weekend he won the title for the fifth time to earn a place in the world championships at Edmonton next month. There would be a certain symmetry if he were to win the gold medal in Edmonton. It was 10 years ago this summer that Pettigrew lifted the world title in Tokyo, denying Britain's Roger Black the championship. All four world championships since then have been won by Johnson. 'Winning another gold medal would be the perfect end to my career,' Pettigrew said. His preparations will continue when he represents the US in their annual match against Britain and Russia at Scotstoun Stadium in Glasgow today. Pettigrew will face Mark Richardson, another runner Johnson picked out as a possible successor, in what will be the Briton's first individual race since his doping ban was lifted last month. Also up against him will be Iwan Thomas, who until he got injured two years ago appeared set to make the number-one spot his own. 'I always enjoy racing against the British because you know it will be a hard race,' said Pettigrew. Johnson has acknowledged that he more or less killed the 400m as a competition and that this season is going to be the most interesting for nearly 10 years. 'The current 400 talent is good for the sport,' he said. 'It will be interesting to see who rises to the top.' Pettigrew said: 'Now Michael's gone, I sense there is a renewed sense of purpose among everyone. The number-one spot is up for grabs and everyone wants it.' But if he does get it, Pettigrew seems set to relinquish the position almost immediately. He is attempting to juggle his running career with a new corporate life he is carving out away from the track. 'I won't say it's been a difficult year after the Olympic Games, but it's been a trying one,' he said. 'I thought about just retiring from track and field. Adidas really didn't want me to, and I have a commitment that I gave to them. 'I've been busy with my own businesses, hotel investments plus marketing stuff that I'm doing, public speaking, and being honoured at several different places. It's been hard to have time to train and do the things I need to do. 'It's really tough to be 33 and compete on the level where you have to run 44 seconds each time you go out. I try to lift weights; I'm up to four days a week. I stretch for 15 or 20 minutes before my workout. As you get older, there are little things you have to do. The training is getting harder. As you get older, travelling and fatigue set in. I won't do much after this year.' If it had not been for Johnson, Pettigrew's medal collection would probably look much more impressive. He has been ranked among the world's top five nine times but always had the massive frame of Johnson blocking his path to the number-one spot. 'Yeah well, the guy's a legend,' said Pettigrew. Pettigrew will race with Johnson for the last occasion at the Goodwill Games in Brisbane in September when they will join forces for the 4x400m relay. It will be Johnson's last ever race and probably Pettigrew's final major event. They were part of the US team four years ago which helped set the world record at the 1998 Goodwill Games. Pettigrew ran 43.2-second leg - faster than even Johnson. His 43.1 time in the relay during the 1997 World Championships was the second-fastest ever in history. 'I feel that when it comes to the 4x400 relay, there is no greater second leg than myself,' said Pettigrew. 'I will always give you that 43-point something.' Pettigrew was disappointed not to finish higher than seventh in the Sydney Olympics but did win a gold medal in the 4x400m relay. 'One thing about me is I don't like people to disrespect me,' he said. 'For all I've done in this sport, I think that was a slap in the face. So, I have to prove to them and prove to the world that I am better than that.' Michael Johnson, for one, is confident Pettigrew can do it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
