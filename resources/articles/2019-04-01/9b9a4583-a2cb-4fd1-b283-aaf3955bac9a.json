But these days the world-famous warblers are more likely to be found jamming with jazz musicians in neglected Berlin parks than serenading Londoners in Berkeley Square. Some even claim that their latest outpourings feature elements of German techno. Luscinia megarhynchos, the common nightingale, has been shunning the UK since the 1960s, during which time the population has slumped by 90%. The number of birds in Berlin, however, is on the rise. According to cautious estimates by the city senate, the German capital\u2019s nightingale population grew by 6% every year from 2006 to 2016: \u201ca very high rate\u201d, said Johannes Schwarz, a species conservation officer, who puts the current number of nesting pairs at between 1,300 and 1,700. So ubiquitous have the feathered crooners\u2019 excited trills become in the city that Berlin\u2019s natural history museum and the German ministry for education and research last year launched a crowdsourcing project to seek a better picture of why the birds flock to the German capital in such numbers, and discover whether their songs have different dialects in different parts of the city. Berliners were encouraged to record nightingales in their neighbourhood via Naturblick, an app that researchers describe as \u201cShazam for birdsong\u201d. One year on, just as the nightingales arrive in Berlin after a 3,700-mile journey from sub-Saharan Africa, usually returning to the same shrubs they were born in, a team of six researchers are beginning to draw their first conclusions. At the heart of the nightingale effort is Sarah Darwin, a Berlin-based botanist who just happens to be the great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin. She grew up to the sound of Vera Lynn singing A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square, but was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d when she first heard an actual nightingale outside her window after moving to Berlin, and immediately spent the night listening to the bird\u2019s song from a tent in her garden. Darwin\u2019s colleague Silke Voigt-Heucke said that nightingales, just like many of the people who come to Berlin from abroad and make it their home, may be attracted to the city\u2019s dishevelled appearance. \u201cWhat makes Berlin unique for a capital in Europe is that we still have a relatively good network of green spaces that are not overtly cultivated. For now, there are still a lot of unkempt brownfield sites,\u201d she said. \u201cPoor but sexy\u201d, a now widely mocked marketing slogan coined by the former mayor Klaus Wowereit, may have had a more lasting relevance in the avian world. \u201cMany of Berlin\u2019s parks haven\u2019t been managed properly for years, which has turned out to be a blessing in disguise,\u201d Voigt-Heucke said. \u201cNightingales nest on the ground within or next to dense bushes, so piles of leaves and stinging nettles are perfect for them.\u201d A lack of predators is unlikely to be a factor attracting nightingales to urban living: Berlin has one of the highest concentrations of goshawks in Europe, and cats pose a constant danger. A map of around 1,500 recordings in the Berlin area shows a number of nightingale sightings on the outer edges of large green spaces, such as the Tiergarten and Treptower Park \u2013 a result, naturally, of the fact that even keen ornithologists are less likely to wander into the dark undergrowth when the birds are singing at their loudest, between around 11pm and 3am. At the same time, Voigt-Heucke said, the researchers\u2019 findings raised questions over whether street lights and busy roads are really a deterrent to birds. One nightingale hotspot is on the brightly lit Strasse des 17 Juni, just 100 metres from the Brandenburg Gate. Another well-known nightingale is found every spring perched atop the same traffic light in the Alt-Treptow district. What if Berlin\u2019s nightingales, far from being put off by the endless noise of the city, are in fact attracted to it? That is the (contested) theory of David Rothenberg, an American jazz musician, philosopher and author of Why Birds Sing. Since 2013, Rothenberg has visited the German capital every spring with a host of musicians to seek out nightingales and play music with them. The result is an entire album of collaborations, called Nightingales in Berlin, as well as a book and a film by the same name, premiering in the city this May. First, Rothenberg said, nightingales would often feel threatened by the sound of a clarinet, a violin or a human singing voice, and try to interrupt it \u2013 a process known by scientists as \u201cjamming the signal\u201d \u2013 thereby preventing any foreign message from coming through. \u201cBut he may respond differently,\u201d he added. \u201cA male nightingale who is confident in his territory, who doesn\u2019t consider you and your clarinet or iPad or voice or cello a threat, will listen to what you play, wait a moment, then respond with his own short song, and then pause again.\u201d Scientists are more guarded about the idea that Berlin\u2019s nightingales may be drawn to urban hubbub. \u201cIt\u2019s true that nightingales get louder if the noise around them is louder,\u201d said Voigt-Heucke. \u201cOne working theory might be that it is more costly for the bird to sing against street noise, and that that makes them more attractive to females. But it\u2019s a hypothesis that would need to be tested.\u201d Where scientists and artists agree is that the nightingale\u2019s song often defies its own cliche. \u201cI was expecting melody, soaring up and down like Chopin,\u201d said Rothenberg of his first encounter. In his poem The Nightingale, Samuel Taylor Coleridge described the bird\u2019s song as made up of \u201cmurmurs musical and swift jug jug, / And one low piping sound more sweet than all\u201d. Instead, Rothenberg found the nightingale song to have \u201ca scratchy quality, a bit like a DJ playing electronic music. \u201cIt has an incessant energy \u2013 it just keeps going. When you play a duet with a nightingale, you have to prepare yourself for them to win. They just don\u2019t stop.\u201d Some nightingales have been recorded singing non-stop for 20 hours. At times, Rothenberg found the birds dropping in \u201cbuzz sounds\u201d as if to confound their listeners, a tactic he likens to jazz musicians playing a \u201cblue note\u201d, \u201ca hip tone, a most excellent riff that only makes sense if used sparingly\u201d. Charlotte Schneider, a Berlin student whose essay on nightingale song structures has just won the regional prize in Germany\u2019s youth science competition, came to a similar conclusion. \u201cI was surprised when I first listened consciously to a nightingale\u201d, she told German website RiffReporter. \u201cIt was less tender and dainty and melodic than it is often described.\u201d Nightingale songs are made up of an impressive variety of trills, gurgles, whistles and rapid \u201cbeats\u201d. During the latter, Schneider said, \u201cthe tones don\u2019t just come out rapid and hard, but almost mechanically precise \u2013 it\u2019s almost like techno\u201d. Until recently, scientists had classified 700 types of nightingale song, which unpaired males intone in the first weeks of spring to attract a mate. But, after sifting through the crowdsourced sound files gathered across Berlin, the researchers at the Natural History Museum have now identified 2,300. On average, a bird uses 190 of these, but can combine them in a surprising variety of ways \u2013 deliberately so, as Schneider argues in her prizewinning essay. \u201cThe nightingale works with the expectations of his audience, so that he gets as much attention as possible.\u201d Like the violin virtuoso Niccol\u00f2 Paganini, she said, the bird \u201cmanages to create an astonishing variety of patterns out of a limited number of motifs\u201d. \u201cIf you asked me who the most beautiful singer in the bird world is, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have picked the nightingale,\u201d said Darwin. \u201cBut they are fierce, that\u2019s what they are. In many ways they are typical Berliners \u2013 not exactly beautiful, but determined.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
