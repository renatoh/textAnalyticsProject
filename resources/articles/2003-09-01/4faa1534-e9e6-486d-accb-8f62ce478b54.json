Last week Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, called for an inquiry into Royal Mail's finances to establish if they were presented in a way that made the need for restructuring appear more urgent than it was. Martin O'Neill, chairman of the Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee, said next week MPs would examine the impact of proposals by industry regulator Postcomm to open the postal market to competition and their impact on Royal Mail finances, and that Ward's concerns would be examined. O'Neill said: 'We are looking at the finances of the Royal Mail in the round and the point made by Ward.' Ballot papers for industrial action sent out to 160,000 CWU members are due to be returned by Wednesday, with a large majority expected to be in favour of a strike. The ballot coincides with protracted negotiations over pay with chief executive Adam Crozier. Royal Mail has offered a 14.5 per cent pay rise over 18 months, with 10 per cent linked to improvements in productivity. The CWU wants a no-strings 8 per cent up-front payment. Postcomm is aiming for complete market liberalisation in 2007."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
