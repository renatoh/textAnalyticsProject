It has turned up at its usual time in two or three Lancashire and Cheshire localities. My first personal information came from a friend who heard the bird at Scarisbrick on the 16th, although I hear from a keeper that he saw one on the previous day. The other arrival is the tree pipit, which was singing in the Delamere country yesterday and is also reported by a friend from near Windermere. Several southern records of both birds are noted in the \"Field,\" and it is pleasant to see that the nightingale has also appeared further south in very good time. My earliest nightingale information came from North Norfolk, where the bird arrived on Easter Monday. \"M.M.A.\" (Silverdale) asks what is the correct name of a bird known to the natives as the \"twirl-up,\" whose note, a soft, low, monotonous call, may be heard at night. The description of the call does not sound like that of the curlew, or I should say that it is a vernacular corruption; it does, however, suggest the note of the ringed plover, which calls like other waders at night as well as in the daytime; in some parts of Lancashire this bird is called the \"tullet,\" and it is possible that in the north of the county the name may be altered. In Lancashire, too, the lapwing is often called the \"tuet,\" but perhaps some Morecambe Bay reader can give further information."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
