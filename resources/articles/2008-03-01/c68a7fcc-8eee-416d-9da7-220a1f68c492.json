Aides to the governor, once known as the sheriff of Wall Street, said no decision has been made about whether he would step down and clear the way for lieutenant governor David Paterson, a Democrat from Harlem, to take over in Albany. There was no imminent word today about the timing of any resignation, but James Tedisco, the Republican minority leader in the New York assembly, said the state \"cannot have this hanging over their heads\". He told Reuters: \"If he does not resign within the next 24 to 48 hours, we will prepare articles of impeachment to remove him.\" If Spitzer, 16 months into his first term, were to step down, Paterson would serve out the remainder of the four-year term. Paterson, who is legally blind, would become the state's first black governor. Spitzer was caught on a federal wiretap arranging to meet a prostitute from a call-girl business, according to law enforcement officials. The Democratic governor allegedly paid for the call girl to take a train from New York to Washington - a move that opened the transaction up to federal prosecution because she crossed state lines. The governor has not been charged, and prosecutors would not comment on the case yesterday. A spokesman for Spitzer said the governor has retained a large Manhattan law firm to act for him. At a Manhattan news conference, a glassy-eyed Spitzer, his shell-shocked wife Silda at his side, apologised to his family and the people of New York. \"I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my - or any - sense of right and wrong,\" he said. \"I apologise to the public, whom I promised better.\" He did not say what he was apologising for and ignored reporters' questions about whether he would resign - 14 months after he boldly proclaimed at the start of his term: \"Day one, everything changes.\" According to the New York Times, the criminal investigation that trapped Spitzer began as a routine examination by the Internal Revenue Service of suspicious financial transactions reported to them by banks. The investigation found several unusual movements of cash by Spitzer to the bank accounts of what appeared to be shell companies. The newspaper said officials found the transactions suspicious, suggesting possible financial crimes such as bribery or political corruption. Criminal investigators from the IRS, working with the FBI, found the money was being moved to pay for sex. A young woman who had previously worked at the Emperors Club VIP, the escort service Spitzer is alleged to have used, was recruited as a confidential informant. A federal judge authorised wiretaps on the mobile phones of some of those allegedly involved in the escort service. The investigation into the Emperors Club VIP gathered more than 5,000 telephone calls and text messages, and more than 6,000 emails, along with bank records, travel and hotel records and surveillance. In an affidavit filed in Manhattan federal court last week, Spitzer appeared as \"client 9,\" according to the law enforcement official. Client 9 personally made several cell phone calls to Emperors Club VIP to arrange a February 13 tryst at a Washington hotel, the official said. In one wiretapped conversation a call girl phoned her Emperors Club booker to inform her that the session with client 9 went well, and that she did not find the client \"difficult,\" as other prostitutes apparently had, according to the affidavit. The booker responded that client 9, sometimes asks the women \"to do things that, like, you might not think were safe\". Four Emperors Club suspects were arrested on Thursday, but Spitzer's alleged involvement only emerged yesterday. After his press statement Spitzer, the 48-year-old father of three teenage girls, retreated from his Manhattan offices to his Upper East Side home. Republicans immediately called for him to quit. \"He has to step down. No one will stand with him,\" said congressman Peter King, a Republican from Long Island. \"I never try to take advantage or gloat over a personal tragedy. However, this is different. This is a guy who is so self-righteous, and so unforgiving.\" Spitzer was elected with a historic margin of victory, and took office January 1 2007, vowing to stamp out corruption in New York government in the same way that he took on Wall Street executives while state attorney general. In his previous position, Spitzer uncovered crooked practices and self-dealing in the stock brokerage and insurance industries and in corporate board rooms; he went after former New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso over his $187.5m (\u00a393.8m) compensation package. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, noted that prostitution customers are often not charged, and said charges against Spitzer might be unlikely. \"Especially if he resigns, he may just be left alone. It may be that the public is satisfied by his resignation as governor,\" Tobias said. Spitzer's term as governor has been fraught with problems, including an unpopular plan to grant driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and a plot by his aides to smear his main Republican nemesis. Spitzer's cases as attorney general included a few criminal prosecutions of prostitution rings and tourism involving prostitutes. In 2004, he took part in an investigation of an escort service in New York City that resulted in the arrest of 18 people on charges of promoting prostitution and related charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
