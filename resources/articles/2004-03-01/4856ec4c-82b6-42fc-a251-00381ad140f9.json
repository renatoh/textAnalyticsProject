Gaizka Mendieta was the key Boro player. He was getting in very comfortably mainly because of Bolton's set-up - effectively, they tend to play with three attackers, with Kevin Davies up front, Youri Djorkaeff drifting to the left and Kevin Nolan nominally to the right. That's fine when they're in possession but when they lose the ball and opponents play through them quickly, as Boro did, the whole tactic falls down. Some of Boro's early passing was exceptional, dinking balls in either to Doriva or Juninho to feed Boudewijn Zenden, or for Mendieta who had a field day on his own in acres of space out on the right. Wanderers never got near to him. Had the Spaniard been playing in central midfield there would have been a marker tight on him and cramping his style. Similarly, if Bolton had played with four across the middle there would have been an opponent tracking him on the right. As it was, Djorkaeff was intent on attacking and that left Bolton light in midfield, Simon Charlton exposed at left-back and Mendieta free to cause havoc out on the right. It was tough on Charlton, who got absolutely no help from Djorkaeff in front of him. Bolton like a rigid back four intent on holding their line, but Mendieta hung back in that iffy area from where he created Boro's two goals. The best way to combat him would have been for Charlton to go touch-tight on the Spaniard - something he would have been reluctant to do because it would have broken that back line - allowing Nicky Hunt to push up on Zenden, Ivan Campo to look after Juninho, and the centre-halves to deal with Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Job. Instead, whether Steve McClaren's side looked to Zenden on the left or not, Mendieta was always available to cut Bolton to shreds when given the chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
