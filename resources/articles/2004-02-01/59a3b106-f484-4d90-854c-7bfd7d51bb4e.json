So you can imagine the carnage at Uefa Towers this afternoon: the all-you-can-eat congealed-lard pancakes; the exotic cr\u00e8me caramels (with quadruple cream) eased down by aged, oak-barrelled wines; before, finally, a contented silence broken only by gently escaping air. But while Uefa suits might have bellies the size of over-inflated Spacehoppers, the Big Cup tournament they control has - thankfully - slimmed down. All of which must be great news for Arsene Wenger. After all, Arsenal's success-rate in Group Stage Two made the Fiver's efforts at the Ritzy's Sad and Desperate Singles Night look almost half-decent. Not that Arsene Wenger is getting carried away. \"Tactically, Cup football over two legs is a different challenge,\" he philosophised, as the press pack nodded away like German Techno fans. \"We need to be more adventurous away and more secure at home and it would be a real bonus if we could score an away goal tonight.\" Indeed. But while Wenger was cautious, Claudio Ranieri was in rum mood. Yes, really. \"We have arrived in good condition and we are confident,\" said Ranieri as his out-of-two-competitions-in-one-week Chelsea side touched down in Stuttgart. \"The Arsenal defeats have not affected us but it is important for us to show that rather than to just say it.\" And that confidence, incredibly, even extends to his future. \"I am confident with Chelsea, with Roman Abramovich, with Peter Kenyon, with everybody,\" he gestured, waving his hands excitedly. Mmm. Shall you tell him or shall we? * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I'm getting worn out with repeating the same thing a hundred times. I have the impression people are not listening, or worse, that they don't believe me\" - Thierry Henry says he's \"bored\" with questions about Real Madrid. Well, you would be, wouldn't you? * * * * * * * * * * * * EVERY SINNER HAS A PAST, EVERY SAINT HAS A FUTURE The Fiver's a great believer in second chances, which is just as well given our last expenses claim. So we were delighted to see that Boston United, the beating heart of Lincolnshire, have re-appointed Steve Evans as their manager. Yes, the same Steve Evans who lost the job of Boston manager 20 months ago after being banned by the FA for financial and contractual irregularities which were uncovered after the club were promoted to the Football League in 2002. It's the kind of black-sheep-meets-prodigal-son-meets-Lazarus biblical mishmash you couldn't make up! Evans has been welcomed back into the fold by Jon Sotnick, who took over the club last month and immediately sacked manager Neil Thompson, whose crime had been to help Boston to 15th place last season, despite being lumbered with a four-point penalty brought on by the carelessness of the previous regime. \"Steve was a great manager but he was managerless,\" giggled Sotnick, playfully slapping Evans on the wrists. \"I will be keeping a tight rein on everything he does and if he slips up then he is out.\" With Evans straining at his kiddie leash, Sotnick went on: \"I want success for Boston United but I want it within the rules.\" Sotnick went on to reveal that the return of Evans to York Street comes with conditions: Evans's contract will run on a month-by-month basis only; he will be paid half a salary for the first year; he will deal with football matters only; and the club piggy bank will be coated in indelible black ink. Well, possibly not the last one, but you get the picture. With half an eye on the sweet jar, Sotnick said: \"I am personally delighted with the events and we must now focus on our short-term objectives which are to bring financial stability, growth and of course league status safety.\" Now, about that expenses claim ... * * * * * * * * * * * * THE BIG FIVE: WIN HOLIDAYS AND ROUND-THE-WORLD TICKETS Guardian Unlimited is five years old this month.

His hip is recovering better than expected and as for his pledge to spend more time with his family, well, we don't know about that. Michael Owen is preparing for an end-of-season scramble for his signature by the only two teams on the planet silly enough to spend lots of money on him: Real Madrid and Chelsea. Barcelona's ex-Arsenal winger Marc Overmars says he and his wife miss the atmosphere of London.

New: | Reply Neil, Has Earnie now earned (sorry!) the right to an automatic starting place for Wales in the Qualifiers? NeilKinnock - 02:49pm Feb 24, 2004 BST (67.1) New: | Reply Dear RedDragon, I have great respect for Mark Hughes but I think Earnie should have started against Russia - and his performance against Scotland showed why. History might have been different if he'd lined up alongside Big John with Ryan Giggs on the other side. Three attackers? Yes if it is the second leg of a Cup qualifier and the option is win or die. I think he will start the World Cup qualifying matches anyway - one of Sparky's greatest strengths is that he's always willing to learn and always trying to get improvement.

Newcastle thought the ban was now over, but had apparently neglected to declare Bowyer \"eligible to play\" for the six European games in question. Oops! Arsenal say they are willing to listen to offers for naming rights for their new \u00a3375m Ashburton Grove chateau. Kebab joints need not apply. Adrian Mutu will miss Chelsea's Big Cup clash in Stuttgart tomorrow because of a thigh strain. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO BBC1: Match Of The Day (11.45pm) Today's disastrous date is something of a cautionary tale.

Sky Sports 1: Football Asia (6.30 &amp; 11pm) \"Walking in, I found my best mate had arrived, with his girlfriend and an old friend just returned from England.\" Hmm. The Fiver's feeling uneasy ... Gillette Soccer Special (7pm) \"We hit it off immediately, and I was encouraged by the rate at which she was downing her drinks. After an hour of small talk, she agreed to go back to my place. So I gleefully declined to go to a club with everyone else, we got in the car, and were on our way.\" You're On Sky Sports (10pm) \"Sadly, we didn't make it.
