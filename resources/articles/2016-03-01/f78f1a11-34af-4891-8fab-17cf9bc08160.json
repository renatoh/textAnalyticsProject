(It may also contain spoilers from earlier series.) Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched episode one. Welcome back, everyone. Well, that was a rollercoaster ride. I have to hand it to Jed Mercurio \u2013 every time I think it\u2019ll be impossible to top the tension of the previous series of this police corruption drama, he ups the ante. This was one of the best openers I\u2019ve seen for a returning crime drama. Tight, taut and filled with any number of twists, it economically set up a fascinating case for our friends at AC12 while also introducing a new \u201cantagonist\u201d (as Mercurio calls them), Sergeant Danny Waldron \u2013 an outstanding Daniel Mays \u2013 who promises to be just as compelling as Lindsay Denton. Of course, we don\u2019t yet know if Danny will be sticking around, thanks to a bold, brilliant ending which saw the show\u2019s supposed lead grievously wounded, possibly dead. Will he recover to reveal all? One of the beauties of Line of Duty is that it\u2019s not a given \u2013 this is the drama that threw Jessica Raine out of a window after all ... The bad guys Waldron is the head of an armed-response unit, which also comprises Roderick Kennedy (Will Mellor), Jacqueline Brickford (Leanne Best) and Hari Bains (Arsher Ali). From the start, you get the sense none of them like each other \u2013 and they certainly don\u2019t by the end of an hour that has seen Waldron shoot an unarmed suspect dead, instigate a cover-up, consider shooting the wavering weak link Hari, torture and kill the uncle of the first victim then end up choking on his own blood while his team, one of whom presumably shot him, stare blankly on. As if that wasn\u2019t enough to be going on with, it also transpired that there\u2019s a wider game at play. Waldron is clearly both victim and predator. A bully \u2013 \u201cI decide who stays in my squad\u201d \u2013 who is also desperate for human connection (the scenes with Rachel when he scrabbled to make some sort of contact were painful), a man who is both impervious to the law and capable of keeping a remarkably cool head (\u201cEasy to say from behind a desk, sir\u201d). And an emotionally vulnerable wreck. The episode also hinted at a terrible backstory \u2013 I\u2019m thinking children\u2019s-home childhood, wide-scale abuse reaching right up the ranks of society, Dolphin Square style \u2013 and, prior to being shot, Waldron was seen placing his list of people who had wronged him in an envelope addressed to none other than Steve Arnott (Martin Compston). The good guys So how are our friends at AC12? Arnott\u2019s magical eyebrows of sexual magnetism have worked wonders yet again and he has a glamorous new girlfriend. He still loves a good niggle though, tracking Danny to his house to have a standoff about the wider implications of the cover-up. Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) is in contact with her children, although it remains unclear if she and her husband have split up following her infidelity last series. She spent the opener undercover once again but, more unusually, somewhat out of her depth due to the constant presence of firearms. Full credit to the show for ably depicting the difference between Danny\u2019s team, who are all comfortable with weapons, and Kate\u2019s nervy handling. (I wasn\u2019t entirely sure she wouldn\u2019t shoot the drug dealers by mistake in the final scene, and the moment with the child was heart-stopping). My personal hero, the wonderfully waspish Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), was on excellent form here. Interrogation Hastings is always my favourite \u2013 it\u2019s the way he brings the air of the confessional to proceedings, helped by the Northern Irish accent \u2013 and he managed to get off a couple of zingers during Danny\u2019s interview: \u201cThings get a wee bit fuzzy for me here Sergeant, maybe you could be a ray of sunshine and burn off the fog \u2026\u201d This time around three have, of course, become four and the devious Dot Cottan (Craig Parkinson), AKA the Caddy, is now firmly embedded in the team, creating a lovely irony as the anti-corruption squad are unaware of the very bad apple in their midst. Has he reformed following the removal of crazed Scottish crime boss Tommy last time around? I have my doubts \u2013 and I\u2019m certainly sure that if Ronan Murphy\u2019s redacted file has any information that might incriminate Dot then it\u2019ll stay safely hidden under the black ink. Case notes I was interested in the tension between AC12 and \u201cI\u2019m a civilian, call me Gill or Miss Bigelow,\u201d \u2013 Mercurio is always great at office politics, and this one could run and run. The interrogation scene was one of the best Mercurio has written. You could see how much Hastings loathed Waldron, as well as just how good Waldron is at bending the rules to his advantage. So Rod and Jackie clearly had a messy affair, with the implication being that she broke it off. Are we to assume that Rod or Jackie sent Hari the message saying it\u2019s time, or is he working for a different as yet unknown boss? Of course Danny runs for miles at night. Every good antihero has to spend time trying to outrun their demons. It\u2019s one of the rules. I\u2019m not sure about the Little List, though \u2013 any Game of Thrones fan knows that those don\u2019t always work out so well \u2026 Children are obviously Danny\u2019s kryptonite. Not only was he at his most sensitive when dealing with the child Kate nearly shot, he also abstained from executing Hari because of his child. Weasel of the week They\u2019re already forming a queue, but the inaugural award can only go to Danny Waldron \u2013 a man for whom the words cover-up are as manna from the gods. Quote of the week \u201cWhen this is all done Steve I\u2019ll suffer for my actions. I\u2019m under no illusions of a happy ending but I ain\u2019t gonna stop.\u201d Sometimes, as Danny Waldron makes clear, a man\u2019s just gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do. Even if it does involve torture and execution gangland-style. So what did you think? Are you glad to have AC12 back? Does Danny Waldron make a suitably conflicted antagonist? And what sort of wider cover-up is in play? As ever, all speculation welcome below \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
