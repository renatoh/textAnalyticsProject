At St Mary\u2019s, two men were filmed apparently making plane gestures during Southampton\u2019s defeat to Cardiff in reference to the crash which killed Sala and left the light aircraft\u2019s pilot, David Ibbotson, missing. Southampton later confirmed police had detained two men, adding: \u201cSuch behaviour has no place in our game and will not be tolerated at St Mary\u2019s. The club will ban those supporters identified.\u201d Meanwhile, two men were taken to hospital to be treated for facial injuries sustained during violence outside Vicarage Road following Watford\u2019s win over Everton. Police said four men were arrested in connection with the incident, which occurred just after 5pm on a stretch of road where the visiting fans\u2019 coaches were parked up. One witness reported seeing a Watford fan \u201clying on the floor, apparently unconscious, with blood on his face \u2026 Friends around him were crying and shouting for people to help and call an ambulance.\u201d It comes a month after the Metropolitan police described fighting that broke out before Everton\u2019s FA Cup match at Millwall as \u201csome of the most shocking football violence seen for some time\u201d. A 27-year-old was arrested last week in connection with that incident, which left one Everton fan with \u201ca life-changing\u201d scar having been slashed across the face."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
