Subs: Cejas, Zago, Cufre, Fuser, Assuncao, Cassano, Delvecchio. Liverpool: Dudek, Carragher, Henchoz, Hyypia, Riise, Murphy, Gerrard, Hamann, Smicer, Heskey, Owen. Subs: Kirkland, Berger, McAllister, Diomede, Biscan, Wright, Litmanen. Referee: Dick Jol (Holland) Please forgive the technical problems. Here's what happened in the first 35 minutes: Early on, Walter Samuel's first tackle went through the back of Heskey and he followed that up with a kick at Steven Gerrard's knee. A taster for Argentina v England next summer anyone? Then Lima joined in the fouling frenzy by clattering into Owen's ankles although a free-kick was not awarded. Liverpool were constantly failing to pick-up Totti in the free role behind Batistuta - and it needed needed a fine block from Hyypia to stop the Italian's effort from a couple of yards outside the box. But it was Liverpool who almost scored on 14 minutes. Carragher lifted a long ball into the box and Zebina was so intent on blocking Heskey's turn that Smicer got in behind for a first time volley that Antonioli did well to block. Batistuta had a clear opening on 24 minutes, put clear by Zebina, but the Argentinian managed to mishit his left foot shot well wide, to the derision of the 70,000 crowd. Another clear chance fell to Heskey on the half hour. He should have been offside as Roma's defence came out, but Aldair stayed in with him, and after Antonioli flapped like a James and Owen juggled the bobbling ball, Heskey squirmed it wide of a post. Dudek's first save came a minute later when Emerson was allowed time for a drive on the edge of the box, as the first half-an-hour or so was marked by a distinct lack of chances. 38 Liverpool's two banks of four are proving mightily effective. There's no real flow to Roma's play at the moment and the crowd are already whistling with some vigour. 42 Roma have a dubious penalty appeal turned down. Batistuta falls down in the box but it was never a penalty - Carragher was merely standing his ground. Wonder how many of those we'll see before the end of the night? 45 Half-time. Roma have had one chance, Liverpool are holding their own quite comfortably. 46 Roma substitute - Assuncao replaces Guigou. 47 You've got to admire Totti, buzzing as he does in between attack and defence. He plays a through-ball but Batistuta is miles offside. Incidentally Roma are still playing a United-esque 4-4-1-1 formation with Totti in the hole. Whenever I've seen them, they've looked better, in my humble opinion, playing 3-4-1-2 with Totti supporting the two strikers - but Fabio Capello (Fabio who?) obviously disagrees. 49 Roma are a bit more enterprising this half. From a corner Candela blazes a shot over the bar. Incidentally Delvecchio, who is warming up, is looking lithe. Another 15 minutes and he's got to be on. Surely? 52 We're back to the scrapiness of the first half. Whenever one of the Roma players makes a mistake the crowd are on his back. Particularly Lima. John Barnes at Wembley anyone? 54 The sparky Assuncao attempts a looper from 45-yards. It's a decent attempt but with Dudek falling back it drops wide. 56 A penalty to Roma? No, Totti goes over near Carragher but the referee is not convinced. Rightly so. Batistuta tests Dudek, but he was offside. By the way, the Roma crowd are in better voice this half - I saw them play Real Madrid in Madrid a month or so ago and they were brilliant that night and they're finally getting behind their team. 58 Oh no they're not. Totti makes a mistake and the groans start up again. 60 A real chance for Roma, the ball is played over the top for Batistuta, who has a yard on Riise, but the Norwegian thunders back and gets the block. It should be a corner but the referee awards a goal-kick to Liverpool. 61 Liverpool substitution: Berger on for Murphy. Immediately Smicer goes down under a challenge from Candela. He gets to his feet gingerly, his face grimacing. 63 Smicer's hobbling off, McAllister - who will be 37 on Christmas Day - replaces him. 64 So close! Assuncao lifts a lovely 25-yard free-kick over the wall but just wide of the post. All credit to Dudek - if he'd have been on target I wager he'd have made the save. 68 Christmas may be round the corner, but there's no excuse for the Liverpool midfeld to keep giving the ball away. It's almost all Roma now, but Dudek hasn't really had many saves to make. Totti displays some lovely skill but he's brought down 35 yards out. The resulting Batistuta free-kick comes to nothing. 72 Hamann crazily turns back towards his own goal. Clear it man! Fortunately as Roma's players crowd around him he's fouled. In the words of the Verve, he's a lucky man. 75 Another dive, this time from Assuncao, who has given Roma a bit more drive (and dive). The referee's not buying it, although he refuses to hand out a yellow card. 77 Liverpool enter Roma's half for the first time in about 20 minutes. Gerrard displays some nifty footwork before being brought down. It's the perfect opportunity for a McAllister inswinger, but it comes to nothing. 78 A double Tommasi whammy! First he's given a yellow card then he's susbstituted for Fuser! What poor luck! 81 A corner from Totti flies into the path of the unmarked Emerson, who has a completely free header from six yards. But it goes straight into Dudek's welcoming arms. 83 Riise slips and Totti's in on the right. He whips a great ball in but as Batistuta steadys himself Henchoz clears for a corner. 84 Liverpool substitute - Biscan on for Gerrard (yes, really) 86 For the first time in the match Owen gets the ball facing the Roma goal. There's panic in the Roma defence and Samuel clears unsteadily for a corner as Antonioli attempts an unsuccessful flying kick. From the corner the ball comes out to Hamann who hits a pearler just over the bar. 87 Chances galore! Roma go up the other end and Lima strikes a shot that squirms out of Dudek's hands and towards the goal! But the Pole is alert enough to turn his body around and grab the ball as it creeps near the line. 90 Foul - free kick Liverpool! Hamann is clipped about 25 yards out, in almost exactly in the position that Riise scored his wonder-goal against Manchester United a few weeks ago. Time for a repeat perhaps? 91 No, alas - the ball is blasted into the wall. Three minutes of injury time by the way. 92 Dudek's shaky again! Assucao has a shot which swerves right at the end and Henchoz clears for a corner. 93 Nearly a last second winner for Liverpool - Berger has a great chance to play in Heskey but muffs the pass. The referee blows up. A good result for Liverpool and a good result for me - I had a tenner on the 0-0!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
