Hours after a breakthrough was secured late on Thursday evening to allow immediate support for businesses and healthcare systems, it became clear on Friday that there remained bitter divisions within the EU over the longer-term task of rebuilding the European economy. The finance ministers have agreed to make available to countries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic some \u20ac240bn of credit lines via the European stability mechanism, a bailout fund for struggling member states. There will be no conditions attached where the spending is related to the immediate crisis. But normal rules on the need for balanced budgets will apply where the cash is spent on the wider economy. On the toxic issue of the so-called coronabonds, under which the EU member states would borrow on the international financial markets on the same terms and share liability, the agreed text only referred to governments working on \u201cinnovative financial instruments, consistent with EU treaties\u201d to create a rescue fund. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno le Maire, insisted on Friday that this would ultimately equate to the joint issuance of debt, despite the opposition of the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Germany. Le Maire said: \u201cI have a firm conviction that the fund will see the light of day and there will be debt raised jointly in a form that remains to be determined. \u201cIt means what it means. The only instrument that does not yet exist in European financing is joint debt.\u201d Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch finance minister, said he was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the outcome after 16 hours of talks, adding of coronabonds that \u201cthere won\u2019t be any\u201d. He told Dutch TV stations: \u201cSometimes you have to put your foot down.\u201d The deal will now be put to the leaders of the 27 member states, with little apparent room for compromise on the longer-term economic response to the coronavirus. For the Italian government, the pandemic has become a test of the strength of EU solidarity. Professor Alberto Alemanno, from the HEC Paris Business School, said: \u201cWe can expect national leaders to offer very different interrogations of the agreement. Several major issues remain open and need to be hammered down, notably the rescue fund\u2019s sourcing.\u201d The entire package included agreement on boosting the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new \u20ac100bn scheme proposed by the European commission to keep funding employee salaries if they are put on reduced hours. All of the measures will need to be signed off by 27 heads of state and government. Charles Michel, the former prime minister of Belgium, who is now president of the European council, the EU decision-making body comprised of heads of member states, said he would hold an e-summit with leaders on 23 April. He said: \u201cThe agreement of the Eurogroup is a significant breakthrough. More than half a trillion euros are now available to shield European Union countries, workers and businesses. With this unparalleled package, we shoulder the burden of the crisis together. This compromise is aimed at quick targeted relief... It is time to lay the ground for a robust economic recovery.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
