The Hours's pedigree should have guaranteed them pop glory. Britpop stalwart Genn has played with Pulp and Elastica, and formed the Mescaleros with Joe Strummer, while Slattery played keyboards in Black Grape and the Mescaleros. Damien Hirst paid for the recording of the Hours's debut album, 2007's euphoric Narcissus Road, and its follow-up, See the Light. The latter was released last month on Is Good, a label started by Hirst and the band, which has now bulked up to a six-strong unit. Mainstream success, however, eludes them, though Genn takes on every song as though he's playing a stadium. Two hands on his mic stand, he sings with total conviction. Slattery, is no less charismatic, rising off his seat from behind his piano to add harmonies. The combination of Slattery's polish with Genn's passion is a powerful one. The songs are intelligent terrace anthems and the crowd sing the anthemic Back When You Were Good with vigour and glee. As the tumultuous sadness of Car Crash dies away, Genn says: \"I fooking love you guys.\" A buskerish take on Big Black Hole is a tender moment, but only when Slattery and Genn reach back beyond their mid-1990s heyday to their defiant Madchester attitude, as they do in People Say and a glorious, trance-enhanced encore of See the Light, do the Hours leave all the problems and preconceptions behind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
