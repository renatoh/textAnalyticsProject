Indeed, its consequences will linger long after the gossip columns have moved on, legal experts believe. The Pirates of the Caribbean star\u2019s claim against the Sun newspaper over an article labelling him a \u201cwife beater\u201d is merely a prelude to a far more substantial claim that Depp is bringing in the US where he is suing Heard for $50m over a column she wrote. \u201cThis is only round one,\u201d said Mark Stephens, an expert in media law at the law firm Howard Kennedy. \u201cWhoever loses is going to appeal. There\u2019s too much in this for them not to, but do I think the appeal will be successful? No. That will be round two. Then there\u2019s the [Depp] case against the Washington Post and Amber Heard, and she has counter-sued both Johnny Depp and his lawyer for accusing her of lying over the spousal abuse.\u201d \u201cWin or lose, tomorrow\u2019s judgment will be hugely significant,\u201d said Emily Cox, a partner and media expert at Stewarts law firm. \u201cIf Johnny Depp wins, he will be vindicated and the more sordid aspects of the evidence at trial will likely be forgotten. If he loses, he is unlikely ever to be able to shake off the \u2018wife beater\u2019 label.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s fairy uncontroversial to say that this was an ill-advised case,\u201d Stephens says. \u201cThe only winners here are the lawyers who are going to be building extensions to their homes and putting their children through private education on the back of Johnny Depp.\u201d Stephens believes that \u2018the traditional orthodoxy\u2019 is that Depp, 57, will win. But much will hinge on whether the judge, Mr Justice Nicol, finds the star a credible witness. \u201cI wonder whether the judge is going to say \u2018I think both parties tried to do the best they could but I could not rely on Mr Depp\u2019s recollection because he was obviously taking drugs and alcohol in industrial quantities and his recollection, however honest, was in my judgement mistaken and as a consequence of that I find for her\u2019,\u201d Stephens said. The US case is not scheduled to be heard until May when Depp and Heard, 34, are both due to be filming new projects. Depp will star in the next instalment of the JK Rowling franchise Fantastic Beasts while Heard is appearing in Justice League. So whatever the verdict, the spectre of another exhausting and potentially damaging lawsuit will be hanging over both parties for months to come. Cox said that Depp\u2019s claim in the US is riskier and higher stakes. \u201cWhile an English judgment in favour of Depp would be good evidence for the court in Virginia, personal lives and reputations will be unpicked afresh, as London is perceived as notoriously claimant-friendly. Defamation laws in the US favour First Amendment free speech, with the burden of proof on Depp this time around. Throw into the mix a jury trial in the US, and it all becomes more of a game of Russian roulette.\u201d For the UK trial, Depp spent around 20 hours in the witness box over five days, facing questioning about his Hollywood lifestyle, his use of drink and drugs, allegations of violence, and his friendships with famous faces including Keith Richards and Sir Elton John. One of Depp\u2019s friends, Helena Bonham Carter, who has worked with him on several films, spoke out in his defence. \u201cThere\u2019s something quite old-fashioned about Johnny, with these manners \u2013 none of it makes sense,\u201d the actor told the Guardian. \u201cThe man\u2019s not stupid. He wouldn\u2019t have gone to this length if he thought he was in the wrong.\u201d Indeed, in his closing arguments, the actor\u2019s barrister, David Sherborne, said Depp\u2019s case was about vindication. \u201cWhat is important to Mr Depp is clearing his name of these appalling allegations, expanded on as it has been over the last four years, as a result of which he has lost nothing less than everything, he would say.\u201d Sasha Wass QC, for News Group Newspapers, argued that there was \u201cno doubt that Mr Depp regularly and systematically abused his wife. The characterisation that he is a wife-beater is entirely truthful.\u201d \u201cWin or lose, this case is going to have a serious and chilling effect on the reporting of allegations of abuse,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cBut this is particularly true if Depp wins. Perhaps women will be more wary about coming forward and making these sort of allegations.\u201d Depp can expect to receive between \u00a3180,000 to \u00a3200,000 in damages if he wins, a fraction of the estimated \u00a35m he has racked up in legal costs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
