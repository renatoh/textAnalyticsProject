While the Gunners\u2019 first three points at United in 14 years came from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s 69th-minute penalty, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team have also lost 3-1 to Crystal Palace and 6-1 to Tottenham while drawing 0-0 with Chelsea at home. United have only seven points from six matches. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a mental thing,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cHome and away form is out the window with no fans in the stadium. You can\u2019t look at that. It doesn\u2019t really mean too much. We played fantastic on Wednesday [beating RB Leipzig 5-0] and now we lose. But we need to get points on the board. Now we need to focus on next week and Everton.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r did, however, admit that United were not switched on. \u201cWe weren\u2019t at the races,\u201d the Norwegian said. \u201cWe were too sloppy, too many passes went astray and the rotation was not there. Sometimes you are playing against good teams and today it was a soft penalty \u2013 it had 0-0 written all over the game [before this].\u201d Paul Pogba conceded the spot-kick for an ill-judged lunge that he admitted was \u201cstupid\u201d as H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn was moving away from goal. \u201cHe needs to stay on his feet. Paul knows it\u2019s a soft penalty to give away similar to Nemanja [Matic] who almost got a penalty,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said, referring to when the midfielder had a second half coming together with the Arsenal centre-back Gabriel. Pogba was remorseful. \u201cWe know it\u2019s a poor performance. Myself, I cannot give a foul away like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I would touch the ball but I didn\u2019t. I cost us the goal today with the penalty. Like I say, details. We have to do better, the team, myself, it starts with me. \u201cI felt like I touched him a bit, I knew I was in the box, I shouldn\u2019t have given a penalty away like that \u2013 maybe I was a bit out of breath, it made me do this stupid mistake. I will learn from that, I\u2019m not the best defensively in the box, I can work on that. \u201cWe also need to do more with the ball creating chances. We didn\u2019t expect to be man for man, but after this we can adapt, we have to find a solution but we didn\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s why we weren\u2019t dangerous with the ball. The team performance needs to be a lot better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
