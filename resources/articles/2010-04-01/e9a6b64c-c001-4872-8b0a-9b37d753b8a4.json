Colin Murray, who has impressed BBC Sport executives since adding weekend anchoring duties on 5 Live to his role as host of the fast\u2011paced quiz show Fighting Talk, is the strong favourite. Murray has long divided opinion as host of Channel Five's football coverage but executives believe his style would be an ideal fit for MOTD2, which has become increasingly popular under the stewardship of Chiles. He could be thrust into the role in time for the World Cup, with a nightly highlights show expected to be a key part of the BBC's plans. Gabby Logan will present this Sunday's show, but there is no urgent need for a full\u2011time replacement ahead of the World Cup as Gary Lineker was already scheduled to host the final two programmes of the season due to the high proportion of key matches on a Sunday. Also keen on the job, but less likely to get it, is Mark 'Chappers' Chapman. Another familiar BBC Sport face, Clare Balding, is being talked of as a potential replacement for Chiles as host of the Apprentice spin\u2011off show, You're Fired. Palace prize At the behest of club chairmen, increasingly muttering \"save us from ourselves\" and wary of players and agents beating a path to their door, the Premier League had been trying to play down its forthcoming overseas TV rights sale bonanza, which is expected to net around \u00a31.4bn over three years. The memo must not have reached Buckingham Palace because the league will today be rewarded with the Queen's Award for Enterprise in recognition of its last round of overseas deals, which saw income double to around \u00a3250m a year. The Premier League was recommended for the award by the prime minister \u2013 who also recently said debt levels at some clubs were \"too high\" and floated radical plans to give supporters a stake in their clubs. The Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, will use the occasion to claim the Premier League is a \"fantastic low\u2011cost export\" and highlight its importance to Britain's image abroad, ahead of looming policy battles over Ofcom's decision to force Sky to cut its wholesale prices and football governance. Ash challenge Someone in UK Sport's major events team may have broken a mirror lately. But the team overseeing a programme of 60 major sporting events to be held here over the next two and a half years, designed to help prepare for 2012, are viewing this week's volcano-related challenges as their biggest logistical test yet. Three major world and European events were planned for this weekend \u2013 diving, gymnastics and mountain biking. While the Fina Diving World Series has had to be cancelled, the other two will go ahead as planned. Simon Morton, head of major events at UK Sport, believes that the crisis management involved in scrambling transport to major ports and liaising with international competitors has been invaluable. Delhi deal Sighs of relief all round at the news that this year's troubled Commonwealth Games in Delhi will be shown on the BBC. A lengthy stand\u2011off between the corporation and Fast Track, the agency selling the rights on behalf of the organising committee, has been resolved with a last-minute deal. It is understood that negotiations dragged on well past the initial deadline as the two sides failed to reach agreement on price. The BBC is also believed to have had searching questions around security and organisation, as well as the risk that high-profile athletes may not attend. Both sides have now reached agreement, although there is still no sign of an official announcement from the BBC and it faces a race against time to find a studio and plan for the event. It is hoped the appeal of the Commonwealth Games in the home nations, together with the appearance of some likely 2012 stars including Rebecca Adlington, will boost ratings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
