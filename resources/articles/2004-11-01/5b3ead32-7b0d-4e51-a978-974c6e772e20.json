The lush Merchant of Venice movie, out this week, is likely to inspire you (much of it was filmed on location here), but there's also seasonal festivities, the newly reopened opera house, below, and various new hotels and restaurants. Where to stay The recently opened Ca'Maria Adele (00 39 041 520 3078; camariaadele.it) in Dorsoduro has plenty of character. Five of the 14 rooms in this palazzo are 'concept' rooms. La Sala Noir's 'hues of pepper, cocoa and other rich spices', for example, result in 'a room voluptuous and hot'. Hmm. Less extravagant tastes are catered for in the deluxe rooms with neutral tones and damask tapestries. Doubles from \u00a3117. What to see From 4 December, Santo Stefano Square becomes a Christmas Village with handicrafts, music and, in Campiello dei Golosi ('Greedy Corner'), foodie delights. Expect jollity next weekend on Murano for the Festa di San Nicolo - patron saint of glassblowers. The famous fire-damaged Gran Teatro Fenice finally reopened earlier this year; tickets start at around \u00a317 (041 2424; teatrolafenice.it). Where to eat Next to Rialto market, Muro (San Polo 222; 041 520 6601) is the latest addition to Venice's gourmet scene; its imaginative menu is reasonably priced, with divine desserts. For more typical grazing, try cicchetti (tapas-style bar snacks) in a bacaro - the very Venetian bar/restaurant hybrid; Osteria Bentigodi (Calle Sele 1423; 041 716269) is a fine example. The big night out San Polo is one of Venice's liveliest districts, and Naranzaria (near Rialto bridge; 041 724 1035) its newest nightspot. Getting there Fly with EasyJet (0871 750 0100; easyjet.com) from \u00a340.98, and British Airways (0870 850 9850; ba.com) from \u00a369.20 (both return)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
