So far today, fire crews have fought back blazes, and containment lines have held. But there are still more than 100 fires burning across New South Wales and 45 in Queensland, some of them posing immediate risk to lives and homes. Crews face a difficult night ahead. There are hopes for some brief respite: a cool change on Sunday might give firefighters a chance to prepare for worsening conditions early next week. Temperatures are forecast to soar above 40C across NSW by Tuesday. The largest fire, the Gospers Mountain fire north of Sydney (larger than Sydney in area), won\u2019t be extinguished any time soon. It is too large to fight, and will likely burn for weeks until there is decent rain. Australia\u2019s brutal fire season will only continue I am sorry to report. But I leave with some joyous news from earlier. You may recall our post about the orphaned fawn rescued by fire crews in Queensland. They\u2019ve given her a name: Ember. A shipping container full of fireworks? Really? This is from AAP: A shipping container loaded with fireworks has exploded and residents have been warned to flee as an unpredictable fire closes in on homes in south-east Queensland. The fast-moving blaze is burning in bushland at Bundamba, west of Brisbane, and travelling in a northerly direction from White Street towards the Warrego Highway. Police have declared an emergency situation for the area bound by Keith Street to Bognuda Street and Nelson Street to the Bremer River and Warrego Highway. Residents within the exclusion zone are being ordered to evacuate as the fire closes in. It should be noted there is significant debate in New South Wales suggesting Sydney should cancel its spectacular, but spectacularly expensive, harbour fireworks display this New Year\u2019s Eve, and instead dedicate the millions of dollars saved to those who have lost homes in the bushfires. The NSW government has said the show will go on. Karma may have cast its vote here. This, I fear, will be the trend for the afternoon. Across the east coast of Australia, fires worsening with strengthening winds, no respite in temperatures. The Bundamba fire near Ipswich in Queensland is posing a threat to homes and lives. Police have declared an emergency situation. See here: http://bit.ly/38b6gNT Properly scary ... this is how much of Australia is burning Fire activity is increasing across a number of fires in NSW. Fires in Queensland are choking the state, hope lies in a cool change. AAP reports: Queensland is choking on NSW\u2019s bushfire smoke as a southerly change sweeps across the state bringing testing conditions for firefighters. The south-east corner of the state is shrouded in smoke, with the World Health Quality index showing unhealthy levels of air quality across parts of Queensland. \u201cWe have seen a southerly change move up from NSW and with it bringing more smoke from the NSW fires, so we actually have seen an increase in the smoke haze,\u201d said Rosa Hoff from the Bureau of Meteorology. Fire danger in the southeast corner continues to trouble authorities as Brisbane swelters in 39C heat with the mercury hitting 40.7C at Amberley near Ipswich. Scorching dry winds conditions have pushed temperatures up and created challenging conditions for firefighters. The hot and dry weather that has been sparking and encouraging fires has been unrelenting, but a cool change is expected on Sunday. \u201cThis southerly change means we will see temperatures ease down, however it will still be above average. It is a relief from the severe heatwave conditions, but it still not business as usual. \u201cOur fire danger ratings will ease back to very high from severe.\u201d Firefighters are pinning their hopes on that cool change for a desperately needed reprieve. Of the 45 fires burning across the state, fires at Redbank Creek near Esk, Millmerran on the Darling Downs and Wivenhoe remain at advice levels. A conservative estimate of 207,000 hectares of land burnt out since the start of the bushfire season is expected to rise, with 22 homes lost. This morning I travelled up the Hawkesbury river and Mangrove Creek. The smoke was incredibly thick and getting heavier with little wind yet. The Three Mile fire earlier crossed a narrow part of the creek at Upper Mangrove, and the fire front is just behind some riverside properties where we find Geoff Newlyn, who\u2019s come up to defend his 23 acres at Lower Mangrove. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for two days, I came up by boat so I\u2019d have a way out if the roads shut, but I think we\u2019re through the worst of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was looking pretty ugly yesterday evening then that wind blew up and it sounded like a freight train coming. \u201cWe\u2019ve had weeks to prepare. Anyone who tells you, \u2018Oh I didn\u2019t know this was going to happen\u2019, it\u2019s not true. \u201cWe\u2019re just smashing down stuff and clearing around structures.\u201d He points at properties across the river where houses which were previously hidden in the trees, just as the owners liked it in this remote bit of river country, are now visible with metres and metres of cleared land around them. Had the fire hit the river here, where it can stretch a hundred metres or more across, firefighters might have been able to hold it off, Newlyn says. But it didn\u2019t and now it\u2019s joined with the Wrights Creek fire which still threatens homes around Kulnura. \u201cThey just can\u2019t put it out because it\u2019s on such a big fire front,\u201d Newlyn suggests. \u201cTrying to get access to the bush is impossible \u2026 and this one will backfill [around here]. \u201cBut we\u2019re not worried at the moment because it\u2019s so slow burning. We sort of want it. It\u2019s going to come, so it\u2019s better now while you\u2019ve got a chance of controlling it \u2026 so this is actually quite a good scenario.\u201d As Australia burns, it is worth remembering that the annual UN climate change talks are underway at #COP25 in Madrid. Australia\u2019s record on emissions, and its role as a major exporter of fossil fuels, has not gone unnoticed by some. Community meetings for those affected by the Gospers Mountain fire... Dr Bidda Jones is the chief scientist at the RSPCA, and told me the NSW fires, which have burned through thousands of hectares of land, including national parks and adjoining forest, would have a \u201cmajor impact on biodiversity\u201d. Depending on the intensity of the fire, it will have had a massive impact on wildlife. And not just on those iconic species like koalas. You have to think of this in terms of how it affects the entire ecosystem. You have animals relying on the eucalyptus trees for their primary diet - greater gliders are another example of that. Then you have a whole range of other species living off nectar or the insects in that environment, and there\u2019s going to be a considerable loss of insect life in those fires. You\u2019ve got issues with nesting areas lost in fires\u2026 often [animals] prefer old trees. And then with fires that have been burning even at low intensity, leaf litter and all the understorey is gone. That\u2019s providing food and refuge to animals there and the animals they would eat. So if you look at the overall picture\u2026 the damage has been so extensive, it\u2019s going to have a major impact on biodiversity. Jones\u2019s own property near Braidwood is around 600 hectares and she\u2019s been developing large parts as wildlife reserve with Bush Heritage. It was lost to the fires this week. Her property and the bush heritage reserve joins a state forest, which joins a national park. At this point almost all of that has been burnt, all of that forest, up to 31,000 hectares. The big trees are still there, and we have greater gliders that live in the forest, as well as powerful owls. So I\u2019m hoping that they\u2019ll be OK. They\u2019ll have lost nesting holes because the many big trees have fallen and it\u2019s the big old trees that have the nesting holes. We have a huge range of birds, eastern grey kangaroos, swamp wallabies, red wallabies. We were going out and meeting kangaroos and red neck wallabies that were moving away from the fire. A lot of wombats - I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re going to eat. All of the forest floor, any grass any shrubs, are gone. Jones said their rainfall records show it to be the driest in 40 years. November is normally the wettest month with more than 100ml, but this year they\u2019ve had 18ml. \u201cAnytime I hear \u2018don\u2019t talk about climate change\u2019,\u201d she says trailing off. \u201cAnyone in my situation has absolutely no doubt these conditions are extreme and are connected to climate change.\u201d Good news in Queensland, a string of fires being downgraded, fire crews no longer needed ... A helicopter involved in firefighting efforts has crashed on the mid north coast of New South Wales. Emergency services says the pilot was the only person on board and he is unharmed. It\u2019s not clear at the moment if it was a water-bombing helicopter or if it was being used for surveillance, but it was assisting firefighting efforts on the Jarrah Road bushfire, near Girvan, north of Newcastle. Emergency services has grounded all other aircraft working in the area while safety checks are carried out, and more information about the cause of the crash is ascertained. It\u2019s being reported the \u201chard landing\u201d caused the helicopter\u2019s engine to catch fire \u2013 this was put out by fire crews. The pilot has been taken to hospital. I\u2019m out on the Hawkesbury River, where the heavy smoke has reduced visibility to dangerously low levels. The Three Mile fire - which last night joined with the Wrights Creek fire - is just up Mangrove Creek, and I\u2019ve watched several Marine Rescue vessels head up that way in the last half an hour. There is very little wind and locals who stuck around to defend property are hoping it stays that way and the fire front burns slowly past them. NSW Fire and Rescue have set up a water pump outside the shop at Spencer, on the Hawkesbury River, for crews to refuel as the battle bushfires just to the north. Geoff Newlyn is staying to defend his 23 acre property near Lower Mangrove, NSW where a large fire is burning through bushland. Roads in bushfire areas will be affected all day. The situation can change quickly, so please check conditions before setting out. Amid the chaos and the destruction, this is just a lovely story, as told by volunteer firefighter Michael Tiley: My name is Michael Tiley and I am from the Stanmore Rural Fire Brigade. Our brigade is part of the Stanley Rivers Group, located west of Caboolture. Last Sunday 1/12/19, the Stanmore Brigade (myself and Joe Canning) together with Hazeldean (three fire fighters) were deployed to a flare up of the fires, up near Jimna. The country up there is devastated by the past fire activity. During the mopping up activity, I heard a noise that sounded like a small child crying. I turned around to see this baby fawn (a few weeks old) walking straight towards me. It was very distressed and overheated, yet I picked it up and we cooled it down with water. It was not injured, yet seemed abandoned, so we placed it in the open storage area behind the truck cab. Advice from others is that there are many lone fawn in the parched country up in the area. The female red deer fawn has now received veterinary care and advice is that it is a number of weeks old. It is now being cared for and fed formula from a bottle every three to four hours. For our brigade members, it was very satisfying to see something positive come from the utter devastation the fires have caused in the area. If you\u2019re out there Michael and Joe, firstly, well done, such a heart-warming story. But have you given her a name yet? This was the situation early this morning in NSW: 94 fires, 11 at Watch and Alert... And a reminder on total fire bans: the Shoalhaven is the eighth region in NSW under a ban for today. My colleague Lisa Cox has written this most excellent, timely and sobering piece: climate experts bewildered by government \u201cburying their heads in the sand\u201d and say the bushfires on Australia\u2019s east coast should be a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. If you read nothing else today (save for this blog, obviously), read this. Behind all of those out there on the firefront, there is an army of support. This vision, broadcast on ABC, demonstrates what volunteer fire crews have been up again, and will face again today. Good morning, welcome to Guardian Australia\u2019s rolling coverage of the bushfire crisis. Australia is on fire, and the country\u2019s east coast, in particular NSW and southern Queensland, faces a brutal day of hot weather, strong winds and no rain in sight. This morning, the NSW Rural Fire Service has warned the Gospers Mountain \u2018mega fire\u2019 north of Sydney will burn for many weeks. The fire has already burned more than 300,000 hectares and has a front more than 60 kilometres. Around 1000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by fire this season. Nearly 100 fires are burning across the state Saturday morning. In Queensland, 40 fires are burning, and temperatures are expected to soar \u2013 up to 12C above December averages \u2013 in coming days. Temperatures are forecast to reach 39C in Brisbane on Saturday, and above 40C inland, in Gatton and Ipswich. The Bureau of Meteorology has painted a grim picture for the coming week, with winds forecast to whip dangerous fire grounds and no rain relief in sight. Some fires are generating plumes of smoke that are so vast, they appear as rain on the bureau\u2019s radar. \u201cThe massive NSW fires are in some cases just too big to put out at the moment,\u201d the Bureau of Meteorology said on social media. \u201cThey\u2019re pumping out vast amounts of smoke, which is filling the air, turning the sky orange and even appearing like significant rain on our radars.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
