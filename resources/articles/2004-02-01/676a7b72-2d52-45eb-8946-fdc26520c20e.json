He is also a combative controversialist who can rarely see a cudgel without stooping to pick it up: only the other day he was belabouring the Guardian over its adhesion to star-rated arts reviews. But even Hare drew back this week from entering into a row with the Murdoch press over alleged factual distortion in his play about railway privatisation, The Permanent Way, now packing out the National Theatre. \"Knight of long knife leaves blood on tracks,\" screamed a Times headline on Wednesday, a somewhat tasteless allegation given that it was privatisation's elevation of profit above safety that led to the disasters at Southall, Ladbroke Grove, Hatfield and Potters Bar. On closer investigation, the Times article amounted to little more than a single complaint by a railway industry lobbyist that British Rail was itself hardly free of high-profile crashes. Max Stafford-Clark, who directed The Permanent Way, dubs this a totally synthetic controversy. \"It is,\" he says, \"one of the least controversial plays I have ever worked on. It has touched a chord with audiences around the country and been supported by all levels of the railway industry.\" What The Permanent Way has also done is reaffirm Hare's status as a committed political playwright who, at the age of 56, has lost little of his radical edge. His previous play, The Breath of Life, alarmed his admirers in that it seemed a time-filling boulevard piece about the long adagio of late middle-age: not even the luxury casting of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench could disguise the play's etiolated thinness. But with The Permanent Way, Hare is back fulfilling his role as the nation's moral watchdog rather than its bedside comforter. As Harold Pinter, one of the play's admirers, says, \"Hare's going great guns and shows a steely compassion for the people he's dealing with.\" The extraordinary thing about Hare is that he has managed to remain a critic of society and a scourge of hypocrisy while acquiring the accoutrements of success: a title, a house in Hampstead, a blissfully happy second marriage to the independently famous Nicole Farhi. His opponents, including the director Dominic Dromgoole, argue that he is not really an anti-establishment rebel at all. \"You get the feeling that somewhere in David Hare's heart\", Dromgoole waspishly wrote in The Full Room, \"he not only sympathises with the enemy, he wants them to win.\" But the truth is infinitely more complex. \"The key fact about David,\" says Richard Eyre, who directed The Great Exhibition at Hampstead, in 1971, and who made Hare a pillar of his new-play programme at the National, \"is his romanticism. He has a passionate belief that life is perfectible and that love and redemption are realisable possibilities. He is a deeply political writer in that he believes in the constant interaction of public and private lives. But he also has a strong vein of sexual romanticism in that he genuinely believes that women are more virtuous than men.\" Eyre puts his finger precisely on what distinguishes Hare from his politicised contemporaries. Trevor Griffiths, the sadly neglected author of The Party and Occupations, is a master of theatrical dialectics and male power structures. David Edgar shares Hare's obsession with the state of Britain and has brilliantly analysed the failures of the left, but he too writes about male dominated milieux. Hare, alone of his generation, shows women not as marginal victims or secretarial helpers but as moral voices and potential agents of change. In all Hare's plays there is a long gallery of protesting women. In Plenty (1978) it is Susan Traherne who speaks out against the lies and hypocrisies of Suez, thereby helping to ruin her husband's diplomatic career. In Murmuring Judges (1991) it is joint action by a high-flying female barrister and a woman constable that exposes police corruption. And in Skylight (1995) it was a speech by the heroine, an East End comprehensive teacher, in defence of despised social workers and probation officers, that earned nightly applause. For a hetero, cricket-loving product of public school (Lancing College, where his contemporaries included Tim Rice and Christopher Hampton, and Jesus College, Cambridge, in the late 1960s), Hare indeed shows a rare empathy with women. The downside for romantics is that they are subject to even greater disillusion than hard-boiled cynics. And Hare's anger is often directed at those who have failed to live up to his own high expectations. Stafford-Clark reminds me that Hare once ardently championed the fundamental decency of John Major, whom he now castigates as having been \"a weak prime minister desperate to fake strength\" and responsible for the Balkanisation of the railways. Unfashionably, Hare also, not so long ago, defended Tony Blair against the \"irresponsible\" attacks of the hard left, a position he has substantially revised since the Iraq war. As Stafford-Clark has shrewdly observed: \"What looks like moral certainty in David often conceals a certain innocence.\" Like most writers, Hare is a bundle of paradoxes: a rebel with a strong romantic streak, a passionate advocate of theatre who increasingly questions the medium's fictional capacity. \"I'm not saying fiction is invalid,\" Hare told me yesterday. \"I still write plays like My Zinc Bed and The Breath of Life. But there are some subjects where I feel that interpretation - what I call the thin smear of fiction - doesn't add anything to the subject. That is why I wrote Via Dolorosa: to have had actors portraying the Israelis and Palestinians I met in my travels and to have had people dressing up would have created a layer of falsity. It's also why the greatest writing on the Holocaust comes from Primo Levi, where the writer simply becomes a pane of glass reflecting truth and reality.\" Eyre also sees yet more contradictions in Hare. \"He can be,\" he says, \"a warm and generous companion but as fierce as a lioness guarding her cubs where his work is concerned. And, while he has all the external qualities of success, he is professionally restless and feels that his reputation and status are by no means beyond dispute. But that's not unusual in playwrights. All dramatists feel that they are always clinging to the cliff-face or walking along the edge of a tightrope juggling plates. Having seen so many playwrights founder after an initial burst of success, David is determined to continue writing and feels he still has a mountain to climb.\" But, for all the insecurity underneath his apparent certainty, Hare remains passionately committed to the theatre. True, this weekend he is off to New York for a reading of the screenplay he has written based on Jonathan Franzen's novel The Corrections - proof, he argues, of American fiction's capacity to deal with public issues. But on his return he will be immersed in a big project, his play Stuff Happens, which deals with the causes of the Iraq war and is scheduled to open at the Olivier theatre in September, directed by Nicholas Hytner. \"I wanted,\" says Hytner, \"a large-scale political project for the Olivier, and David and Stephen Daldry came to me with a mass of material about the build-up to the Iraq war. Stephen has now had to move on to another commitment, but in March David and I will carry out a two-week workshop in the National studio. The aim is to find the right form but it won't necessarily be a piece of verbatim theatre or investigative journalism - it will be a 'play' which David will go ahead and write.\" Already the idea of the project has provoked idiot objections from some Murdoch hack (\"I doubt if Sir David had even heard of the term 'neo con' until a year or so ago when it became de rigueur among the chattering classes\"). Others may find it cheering that one of the great moral issues of the day is to be aired on one of our most prominent public stages. Hytner also points out that Hare brings to the project not merely a 30-year commitment to political theatre. \"Through his long experience,\" says Hytner, \"he understands the mechanics of playwriting and the dynamics that make a story work on stage.\" Hare has written a mass of work, some of which is better than other parts. He can also be, at least if you're a critic, a nerve-racking, intimidating figure. But what remains impressive is his sustained conviction that writers have a Balzacian duty to record what is going on around them and that the theatre has a moral duty to deal with the big issues of public life. Kenneth Tynan once dubbed John Osborne, whom Hare adored, \"a dandy with a machine-gun\". I'd call Hare himself a romantic armed with a surgical scalpel. But you feel that, as long as he's wielding that scalpel to anatomise our present discontents, there is still hope for the British theatre.
