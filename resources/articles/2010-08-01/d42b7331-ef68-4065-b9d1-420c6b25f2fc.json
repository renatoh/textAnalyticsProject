It was, by two shots, the world No1's worst effort on a golf course he loves, at a tournament he has dominated for a decade, winning seven times in 10 appearances. Even more depressingly from Woods's perspective is it could have been worse. A handful of fortunate bounces and some escape artistry of the Houdini variety turned the mortifying into the merely embarrassing. No wonder Woods abandoned the habit of a professional lifetime and declined to step in front of the television cameras to discuss his day at the office. Few could blame him for that, although he did speak to reporters later. \"I didn't play well. The only thing I did good was that I kept my patience and I grinded all day and that was the best I could have done,\" he said. \"Just because I like the golf course doesn't mean I'm going to play well on it. You know, unfortunately that's not the case. You still have to execute, and I didn't do that today. I did not execute the shots that I wanted to execute today.\" So much for the renewed hope with which he approached the latest instalment in the search to win his first tournament since his turbulent personal scandal. So much too for his determination to play himself onto Corey Pavin's US Ryder Cup team. So much for all the hard work on the practice range he had professed to have put in during the two weeks since the Open Championship. He drove the ball badly and putted even worse. He hit some good approach shots, but only to extricate himself from the trouble he had found himself in after wayward tee shots. The upshot of a tumultuous day was that Woods found himself 10 shots behind the tournament leader Bubba Watson, who shot a six-under-par 64, and in a tie for 70th place. More significantly perhaps, he ended the day eight shots behind the world No2 Phil Mickelson and facing an end to his 270-week reign as the world No1. Mickelson started his day badly, bogeying two of his first five holes, but a chip-in at the par-five 16th \u2013 his sixth hole of the day \u2013 revived his spirits and his game. Rory McIlroy, the left-hander's play partner for the day described the chip-in as the best shot he had seen all year. Mickelson was not quite as impressed. \"Well, it was a good one,\" he said when asked how it ranked among many shots he has hit over the year. \"There were some at Augusta that I kind of remember a little more fondly than Thursday here at Akron, but that was a good one.\" Great or merely good, it gave the left-hander all the encouragement he needed and a back nine of 30, five-under par, left him in a tie for second place alongside Kenny Perry. A victory on Sunday will see Mickelson assume the world No1 ranking. Lee Westwood, currently ranked No3, also has the opportunity to supplant Woods with a victory although the chances of that seemed remote after a 71, one-over par. It was a lacklustre effort from the Englishman, notable mostly for some poor short-game play, but he has been around long enough to know the big cheque is never handed over until all 72 holes have been completed. \"I just had a bit of rust today,\" he said, noting that he is still recovering from injury. \"I haven't been able to get much work down since the Open because of my leg and ankle. It wasn't too much of surprise not to get it going round this golf course but in any case 71 is by no means out of it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
