But now, go to any high street, office or packed rush-hour bus and the humble backpack is everywhere. Fashion searches for rucksacks are up 37% month-on-month, according to global fashion search platform Lyst. In the UK the annual amount spent on backpacks has risen every year since 2014 when, according to global market research company Euromonitor International, the retail spend was \u00a3112m \u2013 it forecasts the 2019 figure will be \u00a3219.5m. \u201cThere has been an enormous change in attitudes towards day packs,\u201d says Ralph White, UK managing director of the Swedish rucksack brand Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven. According to Domitille Parent, product director at Eastpak, a brand that has been making rucksacks for over 40 years, an increasing number of backpack buyers are women: nearly 60% of online sales in the UK are made by women, and that number has been rising year-on-year. In the US, according to the market research firm NPD, sales of what they label women\u2019s backpacks are up by 28% in the past year \u2013 with New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco the top three growth regions \u2013 while sales of men\u2019s backpacks are down. Of course, it should be no surprise that women are using a style of bag that is practical and \u2013 increasingly \u2013 stylish, too. But it has taken something of a shift in attitudes for the backpack to find mainstream traction in workplaces \u2013 and gender parity. As with many things, Miuccia Prada was a pioneer: when she released a nylon rucksack, made from military parachute fabric, in 1984, it was considered radical. All the other bags around were, she said in a recent interview with Vogue magazine, \u201cso formal, so lady, so traditional\u201d. In the past, style blogger and backpack-wearer Susie Lau, aka Susie Bubble, has cited the Phoebe Philo effect. As former designer at Celine, Philo led the charge for what many brand \u201cugly\u201d fashion, from Birkenstocks and clogs to backpacks. Skipping forward to 2016, Burberry\u2019s monogrammed backpacks were the elevated version that convinced the likes of Cara Delevingne to embrace the look. At the Tribeca film festival last year Sarah Jessica Parker, the woman to thank for sparking many an impractical tiny handbag trend, was spotted wearing a rucksack on the red carpet. On the Prada men\u2019s AW19 catwalk they were worn by Gigi Hadid and Kaia Gerber, and Chanel\u2019s 2020 Cruise show featured a tweed backpack. With many high-fashion brands, from Gucci to Coach, making rucksacks; the mid range of the market seeing a proliferation of more sophisticated designs \u2013 from the likes of Herschel to Dr Martens \u2013 and more than 400 styles offered on Asos, backpacks have come a long way from the days of Power Rangers or My Little Pony bags. The rucksack\u2019s fashion credentials have been bolstered by the rise of gorpcore \u2013 a neologism coined in 2017 from the acronym \u201cgorp\u201d, which stands for \u201cgranola, oats, raisins, peanuts\u201d, aka trail mix, and encompasses all manner of camping attire. The ongoing popularity of luxury sportswear has helped make rucksacks less back-of-the-bus and more chia seeds and balasana. With the rise of the urban hiker look last year, the field trip look went high-fashion. \u201cThe outdoors as a whole has definitely got more fashionable,\u201d says White. Plus it\u2019s come into cities. With some of the most popular brands hailing from Sweden, they play into our era\u2019s love of all things Scandi. As White explains: \u201cThere has definitely been a rise in the popularity of Scandinavian culture \u2013 from hygge to fika. Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven takes a very Scandinavian approach to its product design.\u201d Its now-iconic K\u00e5nken, was introduced as a bag for Swedish children in 1978. The sheer practicality of the rucksack is a plus point, too. Backpacks are \u201ceasy to wear, hands-free, fuss-free and comfy,\u201d says Georgie Tym, a lecturer at Cordwainers, the shoes and accessories brand of London College of Fashion. Function appears to be winning over any lingering competition from archaic, gendered double standards. If Danielle Drake, PR manager at Sandqvist, a high-end Swedish bag brand, is to be believed, the backpack is to bags what flats are to high heels. \u201cThe past pressure of having to cram all of your gear into a shoulder bag just for the sake of dated perceptions on women\u2019s workplace attire has no place in today\u2019s world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
