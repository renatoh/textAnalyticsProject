Among the many mirages of the last four years, few seemed so lifelike and so tangible as the notion that Donald Trump might just be on to something. It was repeated so loudly, so many times, by so many people, that it was surely plausible. Trump appeared to understand something about the people that the rest of the political class could never fathom. His populism was such a force of nature that nothing \u2013 not his impeachment, not his abuse of migrant children, not his disregard for a pandemic \u2013 would get in the way. In the immediate hours after the polls closed on Tuesday, that storyline was turbocharged because the instant result didn\u2019t match Democratic expectations. But when you lose a presidential election by around four points and maybe 5m votes, you have definitively lost the debate about connecting with voters. The 2020 election should bury this \u2013 the biggest lie of the lie-plagued Trump era \u2013 along with the electoral reputation of Trumpism. There\u2019s no demagogue quite like a sad, defeated demagogue. There\u2019s no strongman quite like a weakman. And there\u2019s no populism without popular appeal. Many progressives watched Tuesday\u2019s results in dismay, believing that anything short of a Biden blowout was the equivalent of a Trump victory. But unseating an incumbent president is not easy: only four sitting presidents lost their bids for a second term in the last 120 years. Defeat is defeat, not just for Trump but for his politics. Biden is heading for a final victory of the same kind of margins by which Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney in 2012, and Bill Clinton beat George HW Bush in 1992. Nobody called those narrow results in an evenly divided nation. Biden has already won more votes than any other presidential candidate in American history. Trumpism was never popular. It never won the popular vote. It didn\u2019t lead to a wave of populist extreme-right victories across the world. Like Brexit, it served as an object lesson for others tempted to follow a fact-free journey into fantasy politics. Flirting with fascism and scorning the constitution did not, in fact, spark a movement of lunatic leaders doing the same. Trump was a disastrous president and a worse candidate. He fanned the grievances of an older, whiter, more male, less educated minority. That\u2019s not a winning coalition. He underperformed his own party on Tuesday, which is exceptional in presidential politics. He couldn\u2019t speak to how he would heal the nation figuratively or literally. He couldn\u2019t show basic empathy towards the families of more than 220,000 victims of Covid. He couldn\u2019t control himself in his first debate against Joe Biden. He couldn\u2019t come up with an agenda for a second term in office. He couldn\u2019t even stop blabbing his mouth about how he wanted to steal the election. Maybe, just maybe, he could have squeaked another victory by challenging all those mail-in ballots from Democrats trying to avoid a pandemic. Instead, he drove record numbers of Democrats to vote early in person. Trump was always his own worst enemy. Worse, he knew what was coming and was cackhanded in dealing with it, just like the pandemic. The suburbs, and especially suburban women, turned against Trump and his fellow Republicans in the congressional elections two years ago. That led to a blue wave that swept Nancy Pelosi into the House speaker\u2019s office, effectively ending Trump\u2019s chance to pass any meaningful legislation for half his presidency. Looking at these awful numbers, Trump took the political shift literally but not seriously. \u201cSo can I ask you to do me a favor, suburban women,\u201d he asked voters in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, last month. \u201cWill you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?\u201d What\u2019s not to like? After six months of scare tactics about the destruction of their homes, the suburbs soundly rejected the entire heap of political manure. If the voters in swing states truly loved Trumpism, why didn\u2019t they vote for Trump? Perhaps they split their votes between a Democratic president and Republican congressional candidates because they were simply Republicans for Biden and wanted a check on Democratic power. Still, Trumpism will survive the loss of Trump. Even in defeat, there are Republicans who believe there are enough Trumpers out there, and their modest wins in the House \u2013 combined with a deadlocked Senate \u2013 will lead them to stay the course. The relatively close nature of election night \u2013 because of the delay in counting votes \u2013 reinforced the feeling of greatness that comes with the white supremacist dream of Making America Great Again. Like Peronism in Argentina, the magic formula of fascism is a taste that is never fully forgotten. There\u2019s a reason why Primo Levi wrote about surviving Auschwitz as a warning to future generations about hating foreigners. Fascism, he said, was a \u201clatent infection\u201d waiting to re-emerge. With Donald Trump, it has infected large parts of America and the world, and it will re-infect us again. But not for the next four years, even as President-elect Biden battles against a real infection and a Senate whose balance of power probably won\u2019t be known until Georgia decides in January. That will lead to mounting frustration for voters on all sides, but especially the wave of young voters expecting structural change from a Biden presidency. Before we get to the primary contests of 2024, we need to admit our mistakes in this cycle as the chattering class of supposedly smart and connected political brains. Yes, the polls were extraordinarily wrong, but our understanding of the candidates was also fatally flawed. Four years ago we were colossally wrong about Trump\u2019s ability to fluke a win in the electoral college. But just 12 months ago we were vastly more wrong about Joe Biden\u2019s abilities as a presidential candidate who could not just win the nomination, but run a supremely successful campaign in the most challenging circumstances since the second world war. Biden was disciplined in a way that was never visible in his previous presidential campaigns, or even the vice-presidency. For a candidate who could ramble on stage endlessly about everything from Irish poets to the cold war, there was no expectation that he could distill a winning message and stick to it. Yet that\u2019s what Biden did. He crafted an entirely Bidenesque frame about battling for the soul of the nation. He chose not to respond to every crazy tweet that passed through Trump\u2019s thumbs. He avoided the traditional campaign strategy of big rallies and door-knocking canvassers to stop the spread of Covid \u2013 at considerable cost to his election-day tallies. But his so-called basement strategy worked. And his sense of politics in the rust belt states was far sharper than the supposedly populist president who said he would magically bring back manufacturing jobs. Early on election day, Joe Biden visited his childhood home in Scranton and wrote on the living room wall: \u201cFrom this house to the White House by the Grace of God.\u201d As the polls closed on Tuesday, CNN\u2019s reporters admitted they didn\u2019t know if Trump had written anything on the walls of the White House. Let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t smear the walls of the White House any more than he has already defaced the institution. That\u2019s what the next several days look like, as the election results are officially tabulated and Trump continues to dump on the democratic process of counting the votes. That\u2019s also the kind of transition you can expect from a president who didn\u2019t even take part in the official transition when he won the contest four years ago. Trump leaves the White House as he entered it: determined to destroy our democratic norms. The triumph of the 2020 election is not just Joe Biden\u2019s. It\u2019s the survival of our weakened democracy, and the hope that it can be rebuilt as rapidly as it was corrupted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
