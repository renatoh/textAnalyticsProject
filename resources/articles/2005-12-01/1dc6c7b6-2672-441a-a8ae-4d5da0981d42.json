The Treasury has given the plans to restore the link with earnings a lukewarm reception, saying the proposals will add up to \u00a316bn in extra taxes by 2020, or an income tax rise of 4p. Yet the pensions minister, Stephen Timms, believes Lord Turner's plans are \"affordable\". Here are the reactions of some Labour MPs. Kerry McCarthy, Bristol East Ms McCarthy felt that there were some good points in Turner's pension plan, as it would simplify the system of pension provisions. But, like Gordon Brown, she was concerned affordability: she argues that burdening the taxpayer with the cost of raising the state pension should not be \"the number one priority. We should continue with the means-tested pension system for the time being\". Lynne Jones, Birmingham Selly Oak The government really should be spending more money on pensions, argues Ms Jones, and while Turner has the right approach she does not think it will work without a political consensus. But significantly Ms Jones is convinced that the costs of the Turner plan are affordable even without higher taxes: \"It is really expensive but it should work without the necessity of raising taxes.\" Anne Begg, Aberdeen South Turner's plans were \"interesting\" she said, and \"could provide an answer\" to some of the questions with regards to women's pensions. Ms Begg has long argued in favour of universal entitlements for women's pensions. As to the costs she thought there were \"reasonable ... if people want that higher level of pension from the state, it has to be paid for\". Dennis MacShane, Rotherham \"The Turner plan provides solid ideas for a good debate and goes in the right direction.\" There was a strong moral cause for action, he said: \"There is a moral hazard, because a lot of low income employees who saved money will not get a sufficient pension.\" Michael Foster, Worcester \"The Turner plan seems to highlight the concerns politics seem to have with problems in the future. We will have a strong debate and big controversy in order to reach a consensus - which will not be easy.\" Talking about longer working lives in return for higher basic state pensions, Mr Foster believes \"that is a financial trade-off that many people find attractive\". As for the costs, \"it is far too early to make any comment on the affordability. There is not a slim volume in Turners report about costs.\" David Drew, Stroud \"I do support Turner's report in general, and in specific, the return of linking pensions to earnings.\" Jon Cruddas, Dagenham \"It looks like a thoughtful contribution to the debate - quite balanced.\" Hugh Bayley, City of York \"If people want to have a reasonable income in retirement, we need a radical reform. People have to realise that they have to make contributions. Somebody has to pay. Otherwise we will go bust.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
