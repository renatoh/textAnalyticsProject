So when the soft-spoken 56-year-old warns that his beloved Labour party faces a battle to win back Muslims in Luton, Downing Street should take notice. \"I was opposed to the Iraq war, I was not convinced by Tony Blair and considered leaving the Labour party,\" said Mr Hussain, who knows about the horrors of war after being wounded during the 1965 India-Pakistan conflict. A Labour member for 37 years and now chairman of his constituency party, he joined the party within a month of arriving in Britain after being thrown into a Pakistani jail for protesting against the 1965 war. Mr Hussain eventually decided to stay with the party he has supported for so long. Others have not, as Labour found out last year when all three Labour councillors in Biscot were unseated by Muslim Liberal Democrat candidates. \"The voters will punish Labour. This could be another Leicester South [where the Lib Dems went from third to first place in a recent byelection],\" says Qurban Hussain, a former Labour councillor who spearheaded the Lib Dem assault in Biscot, a deprived ward where 60% of voters are Asian. Labour should - in normal times - look forward to holding the two seats of Luton South and Luton North. The party won both of them from the Conservatives in 1997 and retained them at the last general election with well over half the vote. Labour knows, though, that Luton's voters have changed sides regularly over the past 50 years, backing the winning party at every general election since 1951. And these are anything but normal times in a town where Muslims, who form a sizeable majority of the town's ethnic minority population, will play a decisive role in the election. To complicate the picture, Luton's two Labour MPs took opposing views on the war. Margaret Moran, the loyalist MP for Luton South, voted in favour of the conflict. Kelvin Hopkins, the rebellious MP for Luton North, should feel more comfortable because he voted against the war. But Mahmood Hussain sounded a warning note. \"I stood in Kelvin's area during the local elections. We told voters we had both opposed the war. I lost because voters said: 'But you are part of the Labour party.'\" Against this background, Labour is undertaking a huge effort to try to persuade Muslim voters that the government provides the best hope for a town which has struggled to cope with the closure of much of its industry despite new employers such as the booming local airport. Ministers hope that Labour's record investment in public services will appeal to Muslims, many of whom have struggled to find work after being attracted to Luton in the early 1970s by jobs at the Vauxhall and Bedford car plants. As part of Labour's campaign, Robin Cook used a visit to Luton's Central Mosque to urge Muslims to stick with Labour even though he shared their opposition to the war. For many Muslims, this is an unacceptable attempt to dismiss the defining event of their lives. As he left lunchtime prayers at the central mosque, Mahmud Ahmad said: \"I respect Robin Cook but I do not agree with him about voting Labour.\" Mr Ahmad, 40, who is married with five children, said he is deeply angered by the targeting of his community by police, who arrested a man in the town last week. \"It is like the Soviet Union,\" he said. \"I am a British citizen. I have a beard and am a different colour but I have done everything according to the law. And yet I am suffering. I go for job interviews and do not get the job even though I have the qualifications. I am a devout person but I am not a terrorist.\" His remarks show the depth of feeling in Biscot, where Muslims shop in Halal butchers and DVD stores sell the latest films from Pakistan. The challenge facing Labour is demonstrated by a poster in the Al Madina superstore which declares: \"Countdown to the deceptive handover of sovereignty in Iraq.\" Fida Bukhari, a Labour voter since the 1970s, said he was jumping ship to the Tories. A successful local businessman, Mr Bukhari said: \"My wife and I are walking away from Labour. I think all Muslims are the same. Michael Howard has a credible position because he says that he would not have supported the war if he had known there would be no weapons of mass destruction.\" Others take a more charitable view of Labour. Akbar Dad Khan, of the Building Bridges group, believes that Muslims will continue to vote Labour, though they will do so with a \"heavy heart\". Speaking in the courtyard of the mosque, where his three young sons played catch after evening classes, Mr Khan said: \"Traditionally Muslims have voted Labour for 40 years. A large part of the Muslim community is not happy with Tony Blair but it recognises that for the sake of their own betterment the Labour party is their natural home.\" Labour strategists believe the results of June's European election bear this out. Labour topped the poll in Luton and the Lib Dems were a distant third. The Tories came well behind Labour. Labour also believes it has caught the Lib Dems playing the race card. In an echo of the row over the distribution of different leaflets to Asian and white communities in Leicester South, Labour has seized on a decision by the Lib Dem-controlled council to move the predominantly white ward of Round Green from an area committee which contained the largely Asian Biscot ward. Mahmood Hussain said: \"They haven't done it in racism terms but it is very close it.\" Highlighting such tactics may be paying off. As he rushed home after evening prayers, a respected member of the community said he would be standing by Labour. Shamsul Haque, 72, said: \"Labour. It's always Labour.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
