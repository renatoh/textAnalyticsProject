'Trust in God and your wishes will always come through,' Nyarko wrote to his trusted relative. Nearby hangs another, this time inscribed in the spring. 'I always wish I was a little fish at the bottom of the sea where no fisherman would ever worry me,' it says poignantly. From optimism to despair, the two messages tell the story of the Ghanaian's ill-starred introduction to English football. It was to this bolthole that Nyarko came immediately after the notorious incident at Highbury a month ago when a fan - since banned and fined - ran on to the field to harangue him about his performance. Last week he was passing through northern France again on his way back to his Swiss wife and their two small children in Basle, having returned to Everton for a meeting with Walter Smith at which the manager agreed that it would be best all round if the player was transferred. 'We have come to a conclusion,' Nyarko said, sadness in his eyes. Nyarko's account of his stormy season, taking in dressing-room fights, illness, injury and finally controversy and escape, says much, in particular, about Everton and the state of the club, as well as proud Nyarko's sensitivity to some of the incidents he experienced. It also tells a wider story, of a clash of cultures, both on and off the field, as professional overseas athletes try to integrate themselves into a football culture being dragged into the 21st century. It all began well enough. Nyarko, having hired a European agent, spent last summer being told that a move to Arsenal from his French club Lens might materialise, with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger considering him as a replacement should Patrick Vieira decide to leave. Instead, it was Everton who came in for him. The fee stretched them but the word at Goodison was that their vice-chairman Bill Kenwright, with his heart in the right place, wanted to give the fans a major signing and Nyarko, a leggy, elegant but combative midfield player, came highly recommended. 'I was blessed,' says Nyarko. 'I had heard that Everton had some problems but I hoped that I could make things better.' He brought over his pregnant wife Barbara and two-and-a-half-year-old son, Alex junior, and they moved into a house in Warrington. There was a glimpse of potential at the beginning of September against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Everton led 2-0, Nyarko - scoring what was to be his only goal for the club - working in harmony with a fit-again Paul Gascoigne. By the final whistle Everton had lost 3-2. In retrospect, that match sums up the player's and the club's season. In the autumn, Nyarko developed flu. 'On and off the sickness came back for two to three months. Physically I was not happy.' His form dipped, Everton struggled. He was shocked by events at half-time of a game against Bradford City in November. 'Archie [Walter Smith's assistant, Archie Knox] was fighting with Stephen Hughes and the other players separated them. It was not the first time. I could not understand this attitude. We have to go on the field and win a game? I can't cope with this. But I controlled my heart.' He could not at Sunderland a few weeks later, however, after he was substituted at half-time. 'Archie started to insult me. I said, \"You shouldn't do that. You should respect yourself and me.\" But he kept on doing this. Sometimes I couldn't tell who was the manager or the trainer, Smith or Knox. He acts like he is the manager. It wasn't just me. He was fighting with so many players in the room. Fighting with their fists. In the end, I could not be in the same room as him.' After the low point of a 5-0 defeat by Manchester City the following week, Nyarko went back to Switzerland, where his wife had chosen to have the baby. In the days after Cynthia was born, he consulted a doctor he trusted about an old knee injury, for which he had played under injection at Lens but which was not serious enough to fail the medical at Everton. The doctor recommended surgery to repair damage around the meniscus. Nyarko reported as much to Everton on his return but, he says, they were reluctant, recommending therapy instead. After the Christmas games, however, he made up his mind that he needed the surgery and wanted it, against Everton's wishes, in Switzerland. 'They sent a doctor out to watch the surgery. They filmed it. Maybe they thought I was looking for a way out. They didn't trust me. There is no trust in that club. No truth.' He paid for the operation himself, he says, because Everton's medical insurance did not cover it. 'They didn't support me through it and after, psychologically, it was not good. To play football is always from the head and this was not good. Some parts of the crowd turned against me. The attitude was very strange. 'The manager changed his attitude to me, which I didn't understand because he is not that kind of man. A lot of people respect him in England and Scotland. Dave Watson was the only one who said hello so I can't smile and I can't talk. What could I do so that the sun would shine on me? Maybe I thought they would sell me.' Still, he began playing again and thought it was picking up. 'We won 2-0 at West Ham and it was a good game. Gazza came to me afterwards and said, \"Alex, you are the top man.\"' Then came the Merseyside derby. 'I put the ball out when Heskey was injured as you must when you are a professional. But this man in the crowd was insulting me. It was very bad.' In hindsight, he says, he thinks it was the same fan who set in motion the fateful chain of events five days later. In hindsight, too, he thinks he should have asked Walter Smith to leave him out of the match against Arsenal. Nyarko had misgivings from very early in the day. Before the game, he was upset when he perceived a team-mate snubbing him during the warm up. In the first half, he began to hear the discontent of Everton fans when he was on the ball. 'I don't understand this. They don't put pressure on [Alessandro] Pistone. He can have as much time as he needs. 'But the game was not too bad. It was 1-1. We were playing 4-5-1 and I think I was getting forward to support Kevin Campbell more than anyone else. Then they get two quick goals in the second half. There was a throw-in, Vieira was close to me. I saw the guy coming. He told me to fuck off and that I am shite and I should take his black jersey. Some years back I would have finished that guy but I have come to find God and the scripture of God doesn't say that. It says turn the other cheek. 'Then I thought I was stupid. He could have put a knife in my stomach, thrown acid in my face. I was very upset. If it had been an opposition supporter it would have been different but it was my own.' Deeply hurt - as photographs captured so vividly - and with the stuffing knocked out of him, he asked the bench to substitute him. 'The coaches told me, \"Go out, go out\", but I can't play my football.' 'I was very hot in the dressing room. I was in the shower a long time. I couldn't talk to anybody.' When Walter Smith called out his name as they passed through Highbury's marble halls, Nyarko just held up a hand and shook his head. He did tell journalists, though, that he was quitting the game. Word soon reached Merseyside. When the team bus arrived at the Bellefield training ground that night, he says, there were fans there urging him not to retire. But fearing for his family, he told his wife not to take Alex junior to nursery school on the Monday and chose the option of flight rather than fight. Back in Switzerland, Nyarko gave an interview to a film-maker friend of his. In it, raw and emotional - 'My head has been very bad after the disaster at the stadium in my country. I have to make a donation,' he says of his recent state of mind - he questioned whether it might have been a racist incident. After all, Everton came late to the recruitment of black players and only a few years ago some of their fans were throwing bananas at John Barnes. 'He could have attacked anybody on the field,' Nyarko said. 'Afterwards, he said it was because of the shirt, that I don't love the club, don't love the shirt, don't love the Blues. On account of my colour, they take it different.' He has reflected on much these past few weeks. 'Maybe it happened for a reason, for me to learn something. I do forgive him.' Nyarko is aware that his habit of swapping shirts with opponents went down badly, and wonders if offering his to Vladimir Smicer, an old colleague at Lens, after the Merseyside derby was a factor in the Highbury episode. You put it to him that lack of effort seems to have been the main complaint. 'In all my career I have never had a season like this for being sick and injured, but still I play 20 games. When you are working hard and you are not being appreciated_' he says, his voice trailing off. 'I have run a lot. I could go forward at Everton more when I had the space. In Lens, I don't do that. You know, there was one player who was injured all season. Nobody forced him on to the field. Nobody talked shit to him.' Was it anything to do with not fitting in, of being a loner? 'Sometimes when you lose you have to be quiet and think of the next game. You have to be professional. The feeling is the same sometimes when I win. Maybe they think I am not happy when I win but I am thinking of my performance. Always I am not satisfied with myself, always I want to do more.' He had no problems, he insists, with the knockabout humour of the English dressing room. 'Gazza cut the heels from my running shoes and then used them as flip-flops,' he recalls. 'Everybody laughed at me but that was no problem. That was just a joke. Maybe Gazza didn't play, but he brought something to the club. If you ask players about me maybe they will say that I don't smile too much but I don't think they say too many bad things about me. Some guys I don't like, some don't like me but that is life.' He has reflected, too, on retirement: 'At the time I was convinced, something worse can happen.' He mentions the name of Monica Seles. 'But for the people who love me, I have to continue to play.' This week he will meet his lawyer in Switzerland and hire a new agent to find him a club - 'Somewhere there is peace, respect, positive action.' Clearly Everton was the wrong club at the wrong time. The picture that emerges of Nyarko is of a professional unprepared for an English game that, at its worst, is ignorantly unwelcoming and impatient with overseas players, notably Africans - and of a character whose own shortcomings included being unable to grasp that in its passion and spontaneity, things are said and done within clubs but, at the best, grudges are not borne. The picture that emerges of Everton is hardly flattering, however. It cannot be coincidence that so many players in recent seasons have had to leave to fulfil themselves. 'Everton could be like Liverpool,' says Nyarko. 'They can be top but they are lacking something. There are so many things wrong from up to down. But my heart is clean. I am not bitter. I wish them good luck. God should bless them.' Would he be willing to come back to an English club? There is a long pause. 'As a Christian you must be open-minded,' is all he will say. It would at least give him the chance to restore his reputation - and to heal his one small regret. Shortly after his goal at Tottenham, a small boy approached him at the training ground. Nyarko recalls: 'He said, \"You should kiss the shirt, Alex.\" Then I see players do that and the next day they talk about leaving the club. But maybe the boy was right. Maybe I should have kissed the shirt.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
