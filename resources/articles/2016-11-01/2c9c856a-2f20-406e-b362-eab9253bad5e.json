Cook chalked up an English record 55th appearance in the role during last week\u2019s drawn first Test with India in Rajkot and has previously spoken of his intention to return to the playing ranks before his eventual retirement. It has raised the question of whether this might even occur after the current series. Strauss, Cook\u2019s predecessor in the job and current line manager, will continue to discuss the matter with the 31-year-old periodically but sees little reason for a change given both the lengthy breaks afforded by his five-day specialism \u2013 England\u2019s next Test series is against South Africa in July 2017 \u2013 and the progress of the current team. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen he is in a really good place,\u201d said Strauss, on the eve of Thursday\u2019s second Test in Visakhapatnam. \u201cI think he is very comfortable leading this team as he has been for a while now, so it probably takes less out of him now than it used to. He\u2019s batting well and he\u2019s still young. It is quite scary how young he is really and I have every faith that he will carry on past this series and into the summer. \u201cEvery indication he has given me is he is driven, he\u2019s passionate, he\u2019s motivated, he\u2019s loving this environment and he\u2019s excited about some of the young players coming through, and that is not a bad place for him to be.\u201d Asked whether part of any future decision will factor in what is also best for Joe Root, Cook\u2019s vice-captain and expected successor, Strauss replied: \u201cYes, but ultimately it is about whether Alastair is the right person to take the team forward. If we decide that is not the case then we think about who his replacement is.\u201d While Test specialists such as Cook will have six months away from international cricket from the end of the year, Strauss is wary of the problem of burnout for multi\u2011format cricketers such as Root, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali, with England\u2019s longest and busiest ever summer looming in 2017 and the following set of winter tours to Australia and New Zealand that could span five months in total. Rest and rotation between formats has, to date, meant one-day cricket is predominantly treated as the secondary format, but after Strauss introduced white-ball central contracts at the end of the summer, and with the dual goal of winning the 2017 Champions Trophy and the 2019 World Cup \u2013 both of which are on home soil \u2013 he concedes Test cricket may yet have to give in this regard. \u201cThe all-format players are the ones affected most by this and we need to be careful about them,\u201d said Strauss. \u201cWe have to be cognisant to the fact that if we just think people are OK then that is when we get into difficulty.\u201d Strauss also confirmed that he will look into the future use of a spin-bowling coach in the current management setup following positive feedback regarding Saqlain Mushtaq, the former Pakistan international, who has worked with England\u2019s slow bowlers during the current series and seen an initial one-Test contract extended up to and including the third Test against India in Mohali, which begins on 26 November. A full-time role is unlikely to be created, however, with the former England captain adding: \u201cPersonally I\u2019m not convinced you need one there every single game that you play but I think you need someone there enough that they develop strong relationships with players and be there at important times in series and on tours. \u201cIt is an obvious area we need to have the right support for players in, while also bearing in mind that we don\u2019t want people there for the sake of it and we also want players to think for themselves and not become too reliant on coaches to do their thinking for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
