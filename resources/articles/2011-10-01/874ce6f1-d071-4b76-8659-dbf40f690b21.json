[Cheerily] Yes thanks, Small Talk. We're at the launch of the \"nearest &amp; dearest\" programme in partnership with P&amp;G \u2013 supporting Team GB and Paralympics GB athletes in the lead-up to London 2012. How important were your parents when your were growing up? They were amazing. They had three children and were always carting us to swimming, gymnastics or netball \u2013 while any extra money they had was put towards a new costume or anything else we needed. They are absolutely the key to being where I am today. They must had their fair share of early starts? Yeah, my Dad used to be up at 5am to take me swimming when I was a kid, then my Mum would collect me at 7am for school. Then when I finished school and training at 7pm they would drive me home. They were just as dedicated as I was \u2026 Bloody hell. Still, it's all been worth it: you're now the 10km open-water world champion. It takes roughly two hours to swim that far, so what do you think about when you're competing? We usually swim on a triangle course so often you'll be thinking 'the turning buoy is coming up now, can I see it?' plus monitoring where your rivals are, the feeding stations and making sure you're always in the right place. There is more to think about than you'd think. But surely the mind wanders? Of course it does. You'd be a seriously impressive person if you could concentrate fully for two hours. So now and again I will think about the first thing I'm going to do when I get back home or whether I need to buy a dress for a forthcoming event. Things like that. It's only natural. What about when you are training? Do you wear waterproof headphones to combat boredom? No, our coach is there to ensure we're doing only what we should be doing. So you don't listen to high-tempo Kylie when you're cranking out the laps? Definitely not. Before you compete, everyone in the race is lined up in front of inspectors who check for jewellery and make sure your nails are the right length because otherwise you could injure other swimmers. Small Talk gathers that it can get a bit rough out there in the water too \u2026 Yeah, because you're swimming in close proximity to others there's always the possibility of that happening. But we have judges who use the football system \u2013 two yellow cards means a red card and disqualification \u2013 to ensure it doesn't get too bad. So who is the Vinnie Jones of the open-water swimming world? I couldn't possibly comment [laughs]. Sir Chris Hoy says he's worked out his training schedule from now until London 2012, and he knows he can only have four bottles of wine over the next 10 months and exactly when he can have them. Is your regime like that? No, it's not quite as strict! We finish our Saturday swim at 8.30am so technically we have most of the weekend to recover and relax and it's really important that we get away from swimming. I really don't drink all that much anyway \u2013 but we do get the chance to be normal human beings on weekends. Straighten hair, put on our party dresses, go for dinners with friends and so on, which is brilliant. But training is 10 times a week, in the pool for two hours a session, plus gym on top of that. It's basically like being at school \u2013 when it's not a \"school night\" we can stay up late which means until, oh, at least 10.30pm on a Saturday night. [laughs] Do you have to strictly monitor your nutrition too? Not so much. Obviously it needs to be a balanced diet but I pretty much consume as much as I can because I'm swimming so much. When it comes to nearer competition we eat less because we're doing less volume and we have to make sure we maintain our bodyweight. You talked about being a \"normal human being\" earlier. There's every chance you could become one of the faces of London 2012. Are you prepared for what might follow? Oh, no. I'm just a girl from Heywood who swims every now and then [laughs]. So you're not prepared for the possibility of paps and glossy magazine photoshoots? It's brilliant to do some stuff with my sponsors and get a taste of it. But no, it's not something I'm thinking about happening. No plans to sell your wedding next September to Hello! for a million pounds, then? Well, if Hello! wants to pay me a \u00a31m for my wedding they can do that, they really can! Right, on to the important stuff. What's your favourite CD at the moment? Above &amp; Beyond's Group Therapy album. And the last book you read? Well, I'm currently reading Giant George. [Small Talk looks baffled] It's a book about the world's largest dog, a Great Dane who is really massive. Er, OK. Cheese or chocolate? Chocolate. Anything in particular? Pretty much anything with hazelnut in it, although I'm a Milka girl. What's your favourite tipple? I don't think I can answer that question \u2026 It's not something horrendous like Pernod and Black is it? No, not at all. it's just that I drink so rarely. I guess a glass of Pimm's in the summer is always quite nice. What's the best part of your job? Seeing different parts of the world ... [pauses] although often you don't actually get to see much of it when you're competing. Still ... And, finally, what are your plans post-London 2012? No idea! Often I do feel like the little kid who is asked: what are you going to do when you grow up? I'd love to get in the media side of things, but we'll wait and see what happens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
