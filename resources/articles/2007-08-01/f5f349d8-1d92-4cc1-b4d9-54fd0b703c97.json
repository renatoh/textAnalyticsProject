It is true that projects to \"teach street children\" form a large part of the \"voluntourism'\" that our 18-year-olds overseas are accused of. However, this almost always means helping with reading and pronunciation, as opposed to teaching a syllabus. It's a valuable skill that any native English-speaker can help to pass on, and there is a global shortage of volunteers willing to do so. Their work is not only extremely useful; more often than not it palpably changes the lives of at least a few. Any 18-year-old who spends 12 months of their spare time creating activities to raise over \u00a33,000, and who then has the courage to head out to a continent like Africa and spend their time helping others to read should be applauded, not judged. It's important to understand that less than 6% of those who take a gap year at 18 choose to volunteer overseas. We are not talking huge numbers, but I only wish there were more who took up this amazing opportunity. So to have a headline that tells young people who might actually give their time and money to others, two days before results day, that they are \"better off backpacking\" is, in my view, unhelpful. We should also remember that millions of pounds raised by these volunteers over the years have gone directly into projects overseas. So next time you see them sitting in baths of cat food, cycling hundreds of miles, washing cars and organising charity events to raise funds for this type of project, throw them a pound coin rather than belittle them. It's also worth questioning some of the motivation behind VSO's \"latest salvo in its criticism of the overseas volunteering sector of the booming gap year industry\". This is the second time that VSO has used this tactic to promote their own gap-year placement scheme, which is in direct competition with the organisations whose reputations are being questioned by implication. That said, there's no question that VSO are right to recommend a code of conduct. The issue of regulation of the placement industry has been around since 1999, something that we have been actively calling for since then. As a portal, it is very difficult for us to know which organisations run quality placements and which don't. Parents and young people trust websites like ours to get it right, so some sort of kite-mark is badly needed. The safety aspects alone are worrying; it's important to know that these projects are properly organised. The gap-year placement industry tried unsuccessfully to self-regulate through the Year Out Group, but support from the Department for Education and Ucas disappeared. Since then Tourism Concern and the Royal Geographical Society have picked up the baton, but as yet no regulation with teeth exists. Maybe VSO will succeed where others have failed. \u00b7 Tom Griffiths is the founder of gapyear.com editor@gapyear.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
