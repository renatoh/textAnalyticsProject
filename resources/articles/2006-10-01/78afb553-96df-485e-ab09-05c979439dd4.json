In James Herbert's world, things go bump in the night with spine-tingling efficacy only to carry on bumping, thumping and violently swaying until the tension is interspersed by laughter. Herbert is Blighty's answer to Stephen King: a leather-clad behemoth of the horror world with global sales of over 40 million. He has written about mutant rats, sexed-up fairies and reincarnation, among other phenomena. The Secret of Crickley Hall is being published as a \"classic\" ghost story, and indeed there are ghouls in every cupboard, but in reality it's a camp haunted-house chiller straight out of Hammer Horror, complete with spectacular lighting effects and creaking cast-iron chandelier. Gabe and Eve Caleigh are trying to start a new life after a terrible incident in which their five-year-old son has disappeared. They see fit to relocate themselves and their daughters to a rain-swept house in a Devonshire ravine named Devil's Cleave: \"a tomb of a place. A mausoleum\" featuring \"dark louring skies\", vast galleried hall, and a gothic leopard's head of a door knocker. What a surprise to us all, then, when the activities in said mansion make the Bates Motel look like a sunny little bungalow. Even the lovable family mutt freaks out and the ghosties play up on the very first night. Paranormal events become a daily and, naturally, nightly component of life in the new house: mysterious pools of water appear, noises escalate, cupboard doors are vigorously rattled, and apparitions begin trooping through the light motes. More prosaically there is Gabe's new job to contend with, schoolgirl bullying from the local pram-face, and neighbours' hushed hints of horrors past. It turns out that during the second world war, the village was decimated by a flood. Crickley Hall was home to a group of poor orphans evacuated from London to live in spooksville under the care of the sadistic Augustus Cribben, who terrorised, starved and beat them. The orphans were seemingly washed away by the flood and now their lost spirits haunt the hall, pursued by the monstrous figure of Cribben. Eve's overwhelming grief for their son Cam leads to dreams about him and an attempt to trace him through a spiritualist. The fact that we don't know whether Cam is dead or alive is made particularly poignant by the story of the Crickley Hall orphans and adds an ongoing strand of suspense. As the connections between the hall's history and its haunted house-style activities multiply, the twists become twistier, and mortal as well as paranormal surprises come tumbling out: one of the protagonists wasn't drowned after all, and is alive, well and evil down at the local boozer, for instance. Something must give, and give it does. This is a jolly silly book. It's ham-fisted horror packed with mini-cliffhangers and ghosts of the rattle-and-scream variety. It's also a page-turner, a moving account of bereavement, and a gripping read to the end, despite its fatuous devices. The stock yank Gabe is a walking dictionary of cod-American idiom, as though he's freshly bumbled in from the midwest rather than lived in England for years. His slightly wet wife Eve is a more convincing character - even the terrified household mongrel beats Gabe for subtlety. As an exploration of evil - and Cribben is sadistic almost beyond the bounds of literary acceptability - this is a powerfully disturbing read, though at times gratuitously horrible. The Turn of the Screw it is not, and nor does it intend to be. Two pages in, the reader is hooked, and Herbert has done his job. The horror, the horror. \u00b7 Joanna Briscoe's novel Sleep with Me is published by Bloomsbury"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
