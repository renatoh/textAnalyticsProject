Not least with the European Arts Company's production of The Trials of Oscar Wilde, an astute drama that Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland and John O'Connor based on the transcripts of Wilde's court appearances. Apart from the bons mots, what comes across keenly is the establishment at its worst. The arguments against Wilde were leaden: what was the point of writing if it was not to impose a moral code? They were hypocritical: what, no homosexuals in those ranks of public schoolboys? They were arrantly snobbish. How on earth, ran the argument, could Wilde possibly have dined with a groom? The snobbery point is made neatly in this fob-pocket-size production by Peter Craze, in which the nimble William Kempsell and Rupert Mason appear both as beady-eyed barristers and as rent boys, chambermaids, \"professors of the masseur\", policemen and blackmailers. Meanwhile, John Gorick is a lofty and beguiling Wilde, his thumbs in his embroidered waistcoat pockets, his long cheeks fading slowly from confidence to misery. \"If England treats her criminals the way she has treated me, she doesn't deserve to have any.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
