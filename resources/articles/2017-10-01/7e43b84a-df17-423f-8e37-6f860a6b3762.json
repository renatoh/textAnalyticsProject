Eddie Jones has long been focused on bringing back the 2019 World Cup but Brown has gone further by seeking to make rugby England\u2019s strongest sport. The day when rugby overtakes football as the country\u2019s pre-eminent team sport is unlikely to dawn imminently but recent events at the Football Association have done little to dissuade the RFU it can set standards others will eventually seek to emulate. Brown admits the target is ambitious but is unapologetic. \u201cOur definition of strongest isn\u2019t necessarily biggest,\u201d he said, when asked how he imagined his vision would go down at Wembley. \u201cThat may be some way off for us but you don\u2019t have to be big to be strong. We want to be the best in the country in terms of the way the game is governed and set standards that are a step change for us and other organisations as well.\u201d Coming from a union that was in meltdown less than six years ago following the acrimonious fallout from the 2011 Rugby World Cup, it also reflects the more settled atmosphere at Twickenham, with the 2015 World Cup having delivered a financial windfall and Jones having transformed the team\u2019s fortunes. For English rugby to continue to flourish, however, there is also official acknowledgement not everything in the rose garden is healthy. Injury concerns, financial uncertainty among Championship clubs and the numbers of players who give up the sport in their late teens remain obstacles to Brown\u2019s desire to persuade floating fans that \u201crugby is good for you\u201d. Most pressing is the need to protect the game\u2019s battered leading players amid talk of strike action. Nigel Melville, the RFU\u2019s director of professional rugby, revealed he would be meeting players\u2019 union representatives on 6 November to discuss their concerns over the mooted extension of the domestic league campaign. \u201cI think we\u2019re very much in line with the players,\u201d Melville said. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting until the end of the season, I want them to know now that we are listening to them.\u201d Melville and others are also looking forward to receiving precise comparative statistics on whether injury rates are on the rise at club level. The verdict of the sports scientists will, in turn, dictate how long a summer break players can expect in future. \u201cThere\u2019s no point sitting in a room and talking about what the off\u2011season should be until we\u2019ve got the data,\u201d Melville said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find out what\u2019s the best way to go. That determines where you start and finish.\u201d Brown, meanwhile, has backed the England captain, Dylan Hartley, before his latest disciplinary hearing for striking a French opponent in the Champions Cup last weekend, suggesting the outcome would not affect the player\u2019s position. \u201cMy personal opinion is that Dylan has been a superb captain for England,\u201d the chief executive said. \u201cI would withhold judgment until we see the outcome of any hearing.\u201d He also indicated England were targeting another Six Nations title \u2013 \u201cA grand slam is hard to achieve but we are not planning to come second\u201d \u2013 and said the RFU is \u201calready scanning the horizon\u201d to identify the best replacement for Jones when he steps down in 2019. \u201cWe need to have plans A, B and C ready. Eddie also wants to leave a legacy and a system that works. I think we\u2019re probably in a better place than we have been in the past. We need it not to be a distraction going into 2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
