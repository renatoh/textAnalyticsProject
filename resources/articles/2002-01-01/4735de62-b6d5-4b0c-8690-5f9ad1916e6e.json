Newcastle will probably not be on top at the end of the season, but they look more than capable of a Champions League place. Leeds, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool to come in their next three games, could have done with opening up a gap here, but despite an ideal start they lost the lead - and their discipline - ending up with only 10 men after another over-physical encounter. Their further entries in referee Graham Barber's book here - six yellows and Danny Mills' dismissal - will bring them a fine, too, to add to their trouble. Already missing four or five regulars through injury Leeds had to make a late reshuffle when Robbie Fowler pulled out due to a family bereavement, returning to Merseyside on learning of the death of his father-in-law. Alan Smith was the chief beneficiary, making a rare start and making the most of it by giving Leeds the lead in under a minute. The home side's opening attack had just been broken up when Mark Viduka gave Smith the freedom of the Newcastle half with a simple header forward from the centre circle, and with only the goalkeeper to beat the striker did so with elan, running straight down the middle and surprising Shay Given by shooting early and true. After the seven-goal thriller at Elland Road last month and Newcastle's comedy defending against Chelsea no one would have put this match down for a scoreless draw, but the entire back line going missing after just 28 seconds must be some sort of record even by Tyneside standards. Sadly, Leeds' quick strike did not usher in an end-to-end feast of attacking football. What followed was 45 minutes of Newcastle searching without much inspiration for an equaliser while Leeds defended doggedly, and what felt like 45 minutes of whistle-blowing by Barber as the atmosphere turned increasingly rancorous. First Smith (what a surprise) then David Batty were spoken to for having a go at the admittedly provocative Laurent Robert, then Michael Duberry and Jon Woodgate went into the book for identical fouls on Craig Bellamy and Kieron Dyer on either side of the penalty area. David O'Leary popped out of the dugout to protest about the latter booking, drawing howls of abuse from the home supporters and reinforcing the impression that the blame for the game becoming overheated could largely be laid at Leeds' door. Barber did well to keep a lid on matters, though it was scarcely necessary to book Bellamy for diving in the 36th minute when he had done little more than come second best in a penalty area challenge with Duberry. Bellamy was once again Newcastle's most conspicuous attacker, heading just over after nine minutes and twice going close with shots from the edge of the area. Gary Speed missed the best chance to put Newcastle level when he failed to find the target with a clear sight of goal 10 minutes before half time, but on the stroke of the interval the home side got the lucky break they needed when a stranded Duberry steered the ball past his own goalkeeper after Nol Solano had touched on Bellamy's cross from the right. Poor Duberry must wonder if his luck is ever going to change. Batty was booked at the end of the first half, earning an almost Bowyeresque boo from his former supporters, though it was significant that the next player to see yellow was Robert. A far from innocent party in a running feud, the Frenchman fouled Batty once too often in the 59th minute. Newcastle should have been ahead by then, Bellamy's finishing skills having let him down three minutes into the second half - he was face to face with Nigel Martyn who made an excellent save. Newcastle did not have long to wait. On the hour Bellamy appeared in the middle and managed to wrongfoot Leeds' defenders by guiding the ball forward with his chest, picking up a run from Dyer which ended with a low shot past Martyn. Leeds brought on Jason Wilcox for Seth Johnson, which did not seem the most dynamic response and looked even more inadequate when they went down to 10 men four minutes later. O'Leary did not try to excuse Mills' actions in aiming a petulant kick at the irrepressible Bellamy. The referee had a perfect view and his swift decision was correct. Given saved well from Smith but most of the traffic was flowing in the other direction and there was a certain inevitability about Newcastle's late third goal. Dyer fed Bellamy, who capped another hugely impressive performance by holding off Duberry and slotting the ball past Martyn. If only he were English."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
