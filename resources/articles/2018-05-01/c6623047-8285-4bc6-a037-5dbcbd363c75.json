I was struck by the statement that the Royal College of Physicians has declared that the problem must be seen as a public health rather than a criminal justice issue. As a (now retired) GP, and since the deaths in the 1980s of four young patients from heroin overdose in our small market town, I cry: \u201cAt last!\u201d Most of us take mood-altering substances, whether alcohol, nicotine or heroin. They are all dangerous, but by treating, for example, tobacco as a public health problem, look at the impact on pubs, the workplace, public transport etc. Bringing heroin into the public health arena and out of the criminal justice system would have an immense impact on crimes related to drugs and prison populations and death rates, particularly among the young, would fall. What government will have the courage to introduce controlled legalisation of drug use, as the Portuguese and Norwegians have done to remarkable effect? Nick Maurice Marlborough, Wiltshire Getting a grip on wind power Regarding the article \u201cPowerful case for UK to get on board with onshore windfarms\u201d, (Business leader), before onshore wind farms are so enthusiastically encouraged by the Welsh government and others, several matters need to be addressed: having moved larger turbines from hills to the settled lowlands, developers need better advice on scale and siting, with a restraint on their urge for the largest turbines; the public need to see tighter controls set over adverse impacts and we need timely enforcement of the conditions. Turbines are sometimes hugely out of scale and so badly sited that they leave residents with a degraded quality of life. We have found that conditions on noise levels can be sidestepped by tweaking turbines during a test period. Since we, the public, pay for the electricity produced out of our high energy bills, and thus public funding is involved, we would like to see any increase in onshore wind accompanied by a guarantee that the size, siting and operation of schemes will be better controlled, that conditional planning consent will mean what it says and that conditions will be enforceable and enforced in a timely manner. Mary-Rose Sinclair Chair of the Pembrokeshire Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales Narberth, Pembrokeshire Generations should unite Rather than pitting generations against each other (\u201cMillennials are suffering\u2026 is it really the baby boomers\u2019 fault?\u201d, Focus, last week), economic and social policies and programmes should unite all ages. Everyone should have the chance to work, somewhere decent to live and support for families with caring responsibilities. Underpinning action on homes, care and jobs should be fair taxation, shifting the balance from taxing income to taxing wealth. Taking care of all generations highlights our interdependence. Let\u2019s focus on what unites us \u2013 our mutual hopes and concerns; prevention being better than cure; technology working for all; support throughout life; and giving power to people. Enabling older and younger people to mix more would help increase mutual understanding and develop common solutions. We can create a Britain for all ages. To make progress, we need leadership and a new spirit in Britain that uses the assets and the contributions of citizens of all ages. Stephen Burke Director, United for All Ages Rewriting Spanish history Those fighting for a historic Spanish image makeover (\u201cSpain fights to dispel legend of Inquisition and imperial atrocities\u201d, World) would struggle to gloss over Charles Darwin\u2019s observation of the Spanish methods of colonisation of South America at the time of his journey on horseback from the Plata to Buenos Aries in the late 1830s. He wrote in The Voyage of the Beagle: \u201cThis is a dark picture; but how much more shocking is the unquestionable fact, that all [Indian] women who appear above twenty years old are massacred in cold blood! When I exclaimed that this appeared rather inhuman, he [Spanish Lieutenant] answered, \u2018Why, what can be done? They breed so!\u2019\u2009\u201d Darwin asks: \u201cWho would believe in this day and age that such atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilised country?\u201d Does the Hispanic Civilisation Foundation have an answer? Margaret Eason Darlington Night nannies for all Having worked as a health visitor for 30 years, I have seen the exhaustion experienced as a result of sleep-deprivation after the birth of a baby (\u201cThe new Mary Poppinses: night nannies are wealthy mothers\u2019 latest must-have\u201d, Focus). This is a major contributory factor to the failure to establish or continue breast feeding, feelings of depression and can lead to family breakdown. It would seem that the \u201cmust-have of the night nannies\u201d, if available to all for the first six weeks, would be a very cost-effective way of promoting health and supporting all families. Barbara Small Norwich Actions and words Please can Jonathan Bouquet turn his attention to the use of adjectival words to categorise people (\u201cMay I have a word?\u201d Comment)? I thought progress was being made, as we seldom hear references to \u201cthe disabled\u201d or \u201cthe blind\u201d. Recently, I have heard a lot about \u201cillegals\u201d, as in \u201cthis country is overrun with \u201cillegals\u201d. Actions can be illegal, people never. Alison Evans Dewsbury, West Yorkshire Unjust deserts Will Hutton concludes his depressing article on the consequences of our leaving the EU by writing that \u201cour country needs and deserves better\u201d (\u201cStruggle as I may, I can find no grounds for optimism on the economy\u201d, Comment). We \u201cneed\u201d to be rescued from the folly of the referendum result and cannot be said to \u201cdeserve\u201d it. Another sage observed that in countries with democratic rule, people deserve the government for which they vote. Martin Smith Felixstowe, Suffolk Fallacies of the Brexit vote No, Mrs May, in voting to leave the EU, the British people didn\u2019t vote \u201cto leave the single market and the customs union\u201d (\u201cMrs May\u2019s attempt to muddle through Brexit is fast approaching crunch time\u201d, Andrew Rawnsley, Comment). They couldn\u2019t. The government denied them the option. Its official guidance explicitly distinguished between the EU and the single market as separate entities. Leaving the EU, it said, risked only losing \u201cfull\u201d and enjoying \u201cless\u201d \u2013 not all \u2013 access to the single market, a potentially important factor for many voters. The ballot paper then offered a choice, in what the government had presented as \u201ca once in a generation decision\u201d, on staying in or leaving only the EU. For Mrs May to presume that voters would also have decided to leave the single market is an abuse of democratic process. She should reread and honour the government\u2019s published confirmation of continued access. David Crawford Norwich One TSB problem solved Questions are justifiably being asked about TSB and what it stands for (\u201cDon\u2019t look so worried, Paul. TSB\u2019s tech glitch will be resolved. Eventually\u201d, Business leader). It seems to me that the late Denis Healey was his usual prescient and succinct self on the matter: the silly billies.
