The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Banda Sea, north of Timor-Leste, on Monday and prompted reports of large tremors in the Top End city. The Bureau of Meteorology issued an alert just after 1pm saying there was no tsunami threat to Australia following the earthquake. Residents in Darwin reported large tremors and feeling tables shake but there were no immediate reports of major damage or injury. Jonathan Bathgate, a seismologist at Geoscience Australia, said the 7.2 magnitude earthquake had occurred just before midday approximately 700km (435 miles) north of Darwin. The quake had hit at a depth of about 200km below the sea. \u201cIt was certainly something that was felt quite strongly in the Darwin CBD area,\u201d he said. A Darwin resident, Leah Potter, told Guardian Australia it had felt like \u201ceverything was rocking\u201d. \u201cIt felt like there were two,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst there was just a little one and my son came in wondering what was happening, then there was a pause and there was a really a big one and the place was rocking. \u201cWe went outside and there were backpackers, I don\u2019t know what country they were from, but they were holding on to the railing looking pretty scared. But, yeah, everything was rocking for a while.\u201d A Palmerston resident, Kavinda Weerachandra, said some small cracks had appeared on his wall after the quake. He was at home working when \u201call of a sudden everything started shaking\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it first but as time goes [on] it got stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cI can hear my house creaking and rattling. And things on my desk started to fall. And I was genuinely worried for my life for a second there.\u201d Parts of the city\u2019s central business district were evacuated after the tremor. Domenic Fracaro was one of hundreds of residents and office workers evacuated during the earthquake. He told the ABC he had been preparing lunch at a kitchen bench \u201cwhen I heard this roar\u201d. \u201cI thought it was a jet aircraft down very low, and my wife started running for the front door,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the drawers started opening in the kitchen, and I said to her, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 \u201cAnd she said, \u2018It\u2019s an earthquake, come on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019 \u201cSo I left everything there and we ran down the fire escape, but while we were in that stairwell, the stairwell was rocking that hard, just side to side. \u201cI lost my balance, a couple of times. It\u2019s the worst one I\u2019ve ever experienced in the four years we\u2019ve been here, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Bathgate said earthquakes of that magnitude were not uncommon in the Banda Sea. \u201cWe get magnitude sevens not often but on a regular sort of basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last magnitude seven in this area was in 2012 at 7.1, and prior to that there was a 7.1 in 2005. They happen sort of once every 10 years or even more frequently than that.\u201d The quake came just hours after a 6.1-magnitude earthquake hit Papua, also in the eastern part of the south-east Asian archipelago. That quake hit about 240km west of the town of Abepura in Papua province, at a relatively shallow depth of 21km, according to the United States Geological Survey. There were also no immediate reports of casualties. A shallower 6.3-magnitude hit the area last week, but the damage was not extensive. Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity owing to its position on the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, where tectonic plates collide. A University of Melbourne earthquake scientist, Assoc Prof Mark Quigley, told Guardian Australia that seismic activity in the region tended to \u201cebb and flow\u201d. \u201cThe seismic activity waxes and wanes all the time \u2013 it\u2019s one of the more seismic active parts of the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we get ebbs and flows and sometimes they talk to each other, they communicate stresses along the plate boundary and set others off. There\u2019s nothing particularly sinister about major earthquakes there because they\u2019re literally happening all the time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
