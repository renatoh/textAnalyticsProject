I am not that bothered about the press card stuck in the brim, or the cigarette hanging out of the side of the mouth, but the hat I think bestows authority. It's a sight you rarely see these days outside of a an old black and white movie, or an archive documentary, like the one on Sky Sports last week featuring one of our trade's premier hat wearers, the brilliant late boxing writer Bert Sugar. Sugar, who died just over a week ago at the age of 75, always seemed to me roughly half-man, half-fedora, the flamboyant but slightly battered headwear was so much part of him. The cigar wedged into the corner of his mouth, or between two fingers as a pointer reinforcing his wisdom, played a vital supporting role. Bert was chief witness to the genius of Sugar Ray Robinson in the first of a new 25-part series, Sporting Greats. Documentaries on 24-hour sports channels faced with unforgiving aeons of airtime are often mere grout between the live action, but this was a genuine quest for the source of Robinson's reputation as the greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time. There was little footage of Robinson in the ring, the first decade at least of his career having pre-dated widespread television coverage, so the programme leant heavily on the testimony of colourful writer/historians such as Sugar, something boxing is blessed with more than most sports. Friends and former adversaries of Robinson were also tracked down, including the Bronx Bull, Jake La Motta. \"Jake was everything Sugar Ray was not, and Sugar Ray was everything Jake was not,\" said Herb Goldman, another of boxing's army of aphorists, \"A slugger against a fighter.\" \"He glided in, and glided out,\" said the late Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali's trainer, \"He was smooth just walking down the street.\" Sugar \u2013 that's Bert \u2013 waved his cigar at the camera, underlining the point: \"He was King of Harlem. His celebrityness \u2013 there's no such word, but I like it \u2013 had a lasting effect, the way he presented himself. Muhammad Ali took everything from Ray.\" A well-chosen newsreel clip of a grinning Robinson behind a bar, mixing cocktails as an adoring crowd looked on made the comparison with Ali irresistible. Robinson's catchy name, which surely helped with the celebrityness, was, according to friends, a fortuitous accident. When a young Walker Smith Junior first started boxing he needed to be a member of the Amateur Athletic Union, and so borrowed the card of a boxer already signed up but not competing, and necessarily took the name as well. The Sugar was added, Robinson said in an archive clip, because of his sweet tooth, although others maintain he got the soubriquet because of his sweet style. Whatever the derivation, when Robinson ran out of opponents in America and toured Europe in the 1940s and '50s crowds turned out to greet Le Grande Sucre. \"He could throw a knockout punch going backwards,\" said the other Sugar. \"His defence was great, he was seamless, etc, etc, etc, and the etceteras go on for about five pages.\" Robinson's wavy hair, said Sugar, remained magically unruffled after a fight, and most remarkably, the boxer never succumbed to frequent overtures from the underworld. \"He manoeuvred around it,\" said his friend Mel Dick. On the subject of paragons, Lionel Messi topped the bill in ITV's coverage of the Champions League quarter-final between Milan and Barcelona, despite being at less than his best. Irony fans may have noted commentator Peter Drury saying, \"It's worth reminding ourselves it's not just about Messi and 21 others,\" closely followed by the half-time montage sequence, over which Adrian Chiles lauded the little genius \u2013 Messi, not Drury \u2013 \"trying to burrow his way through, shooting, gesticulating\". Even his gesticulating is world class, apparently. By full time, the story was how effectively Milan had shackled Messi. But the real fun on ITV Sport is watching the relationship between Chiles and pundit Roy Keane develop \u2013 or not. An email from reader James Gill notes: \"You get the impression Chiles desperately wants to be pals with Keane (or at least liked. Or even acknowledged), but it's just not being reciprocated.\" There were plenty of examples of this in the couple's latest outing at San Siro, where Chiles would cue into, say, a clip of a crunching tackle by Milan's Ambrosini, commenting, with a chummy chuckle, \"'ere, you'll appreciate this, Roy\", which the former midfield hard man might reward with a half-smile or spurn altogether (Treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen). Second pundit Gareth Southgate plays the best friend joining them behind the bike sheds to save embarrassment. The punditry, of course, is just so much blether, so I am grateful to Gill for the subtext, and I take my hat off to him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
