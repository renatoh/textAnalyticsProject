The decision by a three-person disciplinary panel to allow Williamson, the Derby North MP, back into the parliamentary party with a reprimand after suggesting the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism has prompted a fierce reaction. In a joint statement led by Watson, 121 of the party\u2019s MPs and peers said they could not \u201coverstate the depth and breadth of hurt and anger felt about the readmission of Chris Williamson into the Labour party\u201d. \u201cIt is clear to us that the Labour party\u2019s disciplinary process remains mired by the appearance of political interference. This must stop. We need a truly independent process,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe call on Jeremy Corbyn to show leadership by asking for this inappropriate, offensive and reputationally damaging decision to be overturned and reviewed. \u201cUltimately, it is for Jeremy Corbyn to decide whether Chris Williamson retains the Labour whip. He must remove it immediately if we are to stand any hope of persuading anyone that the Labour party is taking antisemitism seriously.\u201d Watson told the BBC later that Corbyn had to act: \u201cWe have never had an MP accused of stirring up so much upset in a particular community in Britain. It required a full inquiry. And that\u2019s why [the NEC] decision is so bewildering. \u201cSadly the only route left is for Jeremy to step in, show leadership, remove the whip and allow our chief whip to do a proper inquiry.\u201d In a separate development, 68 Labour staff members wrote a joint letter to Corbyn to express what they said was their \u201cdismay\u201d at the decision. They wrote: \u201cWe do not say this lightly: the decision to readmit Chris Williamson into the party will help to create an environment where Jewish and non-Jewish employees, who care deeply about fighting antisemitism, are made to feel unwelcome by his presence at work.\u201d The Guardian understands party investigators recommended that Williamson face a sterner sanction, but were overruled by a panel from the national executive committee (NEC) made up of the MPs Keith Vaz and George Howarth, and Huda Elmi, a constituency representative. Asked about the decision by ITV, Corbyn said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved in the decision at all, it was an independent panel set up through the national executive. They examined the case and they decided to admit him back in, albeit with a reprimand.\u201d He added: \u201cWe deal with antisemitism very, very seriously. There is no place for antisemitism in our society, and obviously not in our party as well.\u201d Earlier the annual meeting of the Finchley and Golders Green constituency Labour party voted by a significant majority to write to the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, and its national executive to express concern at the decision and seek an urgent review. Williamson has said he received an \u201cavalanche of goodwill messages\u201d after his suspension was lifted. Williamson tweeted that he could now \u201cfocus on \u2026 working for a Corbyn-led Labour government\u201d and thanked \u201cgrassroots members\u201d for their support. He is likely to face a deselection battle in his constituency, but will be eligible to stand again for the party in any election. The Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, who is Jewish, accused the leadership of \u201cpolitical interference\u201d in the decision to readmit Williamson. \u201cYet again, all we\u2019re really asking for is genuine leadership. We saw members of the national executive committee, the ruling body of the NEC, overturned the recommendations of the Labour party. That is clearly political interference,\u201d she told Sky News. Smeeth said she would not be \u201cbullied out of the Labour party\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s other people who have abhorrent views that are racist that need to leave. It\u2019s not me that\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d The veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge described the decision to lift Williamson\u2019s suspension as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight, Hodge said Corbyn could have the decision overturned. \u201cHe could tomorrow get Chris Williamson suspended, he could tomorrow actually overturn the finding of this panel and he could get Chris Williamson expelled,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
