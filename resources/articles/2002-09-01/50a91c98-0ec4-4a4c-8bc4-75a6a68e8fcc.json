It is Williams' first contest under Lennox Lewis's Lion Promotions, having found Don King unable or unwilling to give him the major fight the American promised when Williams left Frank Warren for King last year. Now, with the match live on BBC1, Williams will be keen to look good. Long, 34, is a squat heavyweight who likes to fight at close range, turning things into a test of strength and desire. Williams, 29, like Long a south Londoner, can be impressive when he unleashes his powerful right hand and should prevail. He may halt Long quickly but he is more likely to keep his shorter opponent at bay with his jab, building a sizeable points lead before forcing a stoppage win around the sixth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
