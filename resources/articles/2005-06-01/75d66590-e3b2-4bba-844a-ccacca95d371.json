It's still an odious name, but we'll allow it because it's for a good cause. MoHo equals modular housing, equals prefabs - but rebranded as cool, affordable instant homes so nurses don't have to spend squillions on a matchbox two hours from work. Ups Courtesy of Urban Splash, the universe's greatest property developer (no, I'm not on a retainer), so they're slinky stylee inside. Clever use of space, all built-in like a cabin. Downs Prefab production can be rather lower-tech than the factory-built fantasy suggests: none here so far, but just so you know. Compact, so no slatterns or clumsy clots. Getting around Castlefield is dead central. Everything walkable. Schools Excellent. Ace primaries: Rolls Crescent, St Philip's and St Wilfrid's get the Ofsted thumbs up. Trinity CofE secondary 'very effective'. Property Phase one went fast. On your marks for phase two, this summer. One- or two-bedroom flats, \u00a3150,000-\u00a3200,000, with some available for Homebuy shared ownership. Parking spaces, an extra \u00a320K.
