Mr Milosevic sought to discredit the witness - previously a member of the Serbian Red Berets - by forcing him to admit that he was involved in the highest-profile assassination since the end of the Balkan wars. Despite warnings from doctors, who say he has high blood pressure and is at risk of a heart attack, Mr Milosevic looked relaxed and well-rested in court. He is acting as his own defence attorney. The witness, who was called K-2 to protect his identity, told the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal that he had served in the Special Operations Unit of the Serbian Interior Ministry during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia. He said the unit had operated under the direct command of Mr Milosevic's wartime regime. Pay slips or cash wages came in envelopes from the Serbian Interior Ministry, he added, and Mr Milosevic had been the man in charge. The Red Berets, a hardline nationalist Serb group known for brutality during fighting in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, were recognised by their trademark black army fatigues and red caps. \"We had full support in the form of ammunition, uniforms, and all other necessities,\" said the witness, whose image was blurred on court monitors. \"Our unit had to do whatever it was asked to do. There was no possibility of saying no. The doors of the president were open to us.\" Asked which president he meant, he replied: \"As far as I was able to gather, there was only one president - and that was President Milosevic.\" During cross-examination, K-2 acknowledged his involvement in the 2001 killing of the Yugoslav warlord Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan. \"Were you are involved in the murder of Arkan?\" Mr Milosevic asked the witness. \"Yes,\" K-2 replied. \"That is the main reason why you are no longer living in Serbia and are concealing your identity?\" Mr Milosevic said. \"Yes,\" the witness answered. K-2 said he left the Red Berets in February or March 1997 and became a policeman in the Kosovan capital Pristina. In October 2001, a Belgrade court convicted a former policeman and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment for gunning down Arkan, Serbia's most notorious underworld boss, and his two bodyguards in the lobby of a Belgrade hotel. Arkan's assassination triggered speculation that Mr Milosevic had ordered him to be silenced because he could be a potential witness against him. The Belgrade district court found seven others guilty of either being accomplices or aiding in the murder conspiracy. It was not clear whether K-2 was among them. K-2 declined to answer Mr Milosevic's questions about his current occupation and residence in open court session, and hearings were briefly closed to the public. Mr Milosevic claimed the witness \"doesn't know what he is talking about\", and said that the Red Berets were a \"regular unit\" wearing the hats commonly used by police and army forces. The highest-ranking politician to face war crimes charges, the 61-year-old Mr Milosevic is defending himself against 66 counts brought by prosecutors for his alleged role in abuses during the Balkan wars of the 90s. He faces a possible life sentence if convicted of any one count of war crimes. His trial began in February 2002, and it is expected to last until well into 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
