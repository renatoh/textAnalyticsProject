Alex Haigh, 21, is the first person to have been jailed under new laws criminalising squatting. He has been sentenced to 12 weeks. What a joke. If a small, basic, publicly subsidised room had been made available to him in the first place, he would not now have a criminal record, along with all the lasting psychological misery that comes with the experience of incarceration. This is what happens when the country is run by people who have neither experience of, nor a wish to imagine, what it is like to come to the capital as an unsupported young person seeking employment, and actually find a place you can afford to live in. What they can imagine, only too well, is having a spare house, and wanting to make sure it stays empty. Haigh was an apprentice bricklayer, and was no doubt living on a shoestring as he learned the craft of creating property. I need not point out the irony there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
