Trump\u2019s eldest son, Don Jr, has struck a book deal with Center Street Press, a Hachette imprint, for a title likely to be published later this year. He will reflect on the \u201cgreat achievements\u201d of his father\u2019s administration, a press release said. If past is prologue, it is fair to assume the book will be plugged by President Trump to his 60 million followers on Twitter, offering the kind of publicity that money can\u2019t buy. This is likely to result in a bump in sales, an enhanced profile and perhaps a job offer or two. Such is a bizarre publishing ecology that has developed during the Trump administration. In a sort of literary version of his Fox News feedback loop, authors write paeans to the president, who in turn champions their work, giving a boost to their bank balances and careers and perhaps even their hopes of landing that most coveted prize of the times: a cable news gig. \u201cThere\u2019s a Trump deal: you praise me, I praise you,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this before. In another administration, it would have been seen as discrediting. The people trying to kiss the ring would have been mocked.\u201d Jacobs added: \u201cIn the past people have written books to make the case for the president, but there\u2019s a level of obsequiousness and overstatement about these books that\u2019s without parallel. How much truth-speaking can there be when the currency of the Trump court is praise?\u201d The latest potential beneficiary is Mark Levin, a lawyer and rightwing broadcaster who defends and describes Trump as \u201cthe most abused president in American history\u201d. After his media-bashing book, Unfreedom of the Press, shot to No 1 on Amazon\u2019s charts, Trump tweeted: \u201cWow, Mark Levin\u2019s new book opened at #1. It is great \u2013 keep it there for a long time!\u201d Along with fame and sales, there are other benefits. Last week Conrad Black, author of the glowing Donald J Trump: A President Like No Other, received a full pardon from the president on charges of fraud and obstruction of justice. Chris Whipple, the author of The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency, said: \u201cThe abuse of the pardon power is really troubling.\u201d Trump, an avid golfer at weekends, has previously claimed \u201cI don\u2019t have time\u201d to read books and is notorious as a non-reader even of simple briefing documents. Whipple asked: \u201cWhere does he find the time to become the blurber-in-chief?\u201d Indeed, last year alone Trump endorsed at least a dozen books written by cheerleaders, commentators and former staff. Sean Spicer, who was Trump\u2019s first press secretary, wrote a memoir called The Briefing that was careful to avoid criticisms of the president. Trump commented: \u201cA story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good, go get it!\u201d Sebastian Gorka\u2019s book, Why We Fight, warning of existential threats to Judaeo-Christian civilisation, earned this accolade: \u201cA very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House, has just written an excellent book \u2026 much will be learned from this very good read!\u201d Spicer and Gorka are building careers as pro-Trump broadcasters and pundits. Also angling for attention is Anthony Scaramucci, who was White House communications director for just 11 days, and went on to write Trump: The Blue Collar President. Other books that caught Trump\u2019s eye last year included Liars, Leakers and Liberals by Judge Jeanine Pirro, a broadside against his perceived enemies in the \u201cdeep state\u201d, Hollywood and the media. The president\u2019s response: \u201cOur great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book \u2026 which is fantastic. Go get it!\u201d Then there was Mad Politics: Keeping Your Sanity in a World Gone Crazy by Gina Loudon, claiming to have scientific evidence that Trump is \u201cthe most sound-minded person to ever occupy the White House\u201d. The president urged his followers: \u201cGo out and get your copy today \u2013 a great read!\u201d The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump by Gregg Jarrett, a Fox News analyst, railed against the former secretary of state and her supposed deep state collaborators. Trump wrote: \u201cIt is indeed a HOAX and WITCH HUNT, illegally started by people who have already been disgraced. Great book!\u201d And The Faith of Donald J Trump: A Spiritual Biography by David Brody and Scott Lamb made the improbable case that Trump has discovered God. \u201cA very interesting read,\u201d the president commented. \u201cEnjoy!\u201d But there is another side to the story. Former White House staffers Omarosa Manigault Newman and Cliff Sims wrote unflattering tell-all memoirs of their times in the west wing, portraying chaos, infighting and a cult of personality. Journalists Michael Wolff and Bob Woodward and others have also delivered scathing accounts. Trump has used Twitter to lash out at them, inadvertently boosting their profile and sales too. In the world of Trump publishing, it seems, almost everyone wins. Kurt Bardella, a former spokesperson for Breitbart News and congressional Republicans, said: \u201cWhen you write a book supportive or critical of him, he\u2019s going to tweet about you. He hate-tweets books he doesn\u2019t like, which contributes to sales.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
