Seven months later, he was diagnosed with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes nerve cells to break down, resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. The average life expectancy of an ALS patient, once diagnosed, ranges from about two to five years. The cause of ALS is not fully understood, and no cure is known. Gelhorn was in his mid-40s. \u201cIt was a shock,\u201d said Kathy Fessler, Gelhorn\u2019s sister. \u201cHe was always the one who took the best care of himself.\u201d Dying from ALS is a singularly awful experience; the disease causes the body to progressively deteriorate while the mind remains clear and lucid. Gelhorn had loved being active. He had played three sports in high school, coached girls\u2019 basketball and served as a travel director at Lakeville North high school in Lakeville, Minnesota. The disease progressed rapidly; soon, he was using a wheelchair and relied on a BiPAP machine to breathe. Doctors estimated he only had a few months left. Gelhorn and his family \u2013 his two teenage children, wife, parents, and siblings \u2013 began to grieve. In the midst of it all, Fessler happened to see an article in the Star Tribune about Christy Marek, a certified end-of-life doula who lived only a few miles away. Fessler contacted Marek, who soon took on Gelhorn as a patient. A doula, typically, is a professional who helps mothers during pregnancy and childbirth. Unlike midwives, doulas do not serve in a medical capacity; rather, their primary role is to provide emotional, physical and psychological support. The practice originated in the natural childbirth movement in the US in the 1970s, alongside the Lamaze method and the popularity of alternatives to hospital birth, like water birth and home birth. That same generation of Americans who were having children in the 70s are now approaching their twilight years, and the practice of serving as a doula has expanded in scope. End-of-life doulas use the same concept as birth doulas: they provide support for the dying. \u201cOn all sorts of levels, I think the Baby Boomers, that generation has just been here to shake things up,\u201d said Marek. \u201cThe natural birthing movement, they did that. And now it\u2019s the same thing. They\u2019re saying, no, I don\u2019t want the death my parents had. We are rich in possibility, why can\u2019t I make this whatever I want it to be?\u201d End-of-life doulas are sometimes called death doulas, though many have reservations about the term. \u201cTo me, end-of-life is a process,\u201d said Marek. \u201cThe work I do with people isn\u2019t just about that one point in time when somebody dies.\u201d Although doulas are not required to have medical training, many come from the healthcare field. Shelby Kirillin, an end-of-life doula based in Richmond, Virginia, has also been a neurointensive trauma nurse for over 20 years. It was her experiences in the neuro-ICU that led her towards becoming a doula. Many of the deaths she had seen there, she explained, struck her as cold, sterile and lonely. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t imagine that the person dying had ever envisioned their death to be like that,\u201d she said. \u201cDying isn\u2019t just medical. It\u2019s spiritual.\u201d Fascinated by the idea of a structured approach to end-of-life care that prioritized the individual wishes of the dying, Kirillin enrolled in a doula training course with the International End of Life Doula Association (Inelda), a not-for-profit that promotes the approach. Although there is no centralized regulatory body for doulas, training and certification programs are offered by a number of organizations, including Inelda and the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont. \u201cThere\u2019s so much fear and anxiety about death,\u201d said Janie Rakow, the president of Inelda. \u201cThe doulas are there to calm everyone down. They work with the dying and their families to educate, to explain what\u2019s happening. That what they\u2019re seeing is part of the dying process.\u201d Rakow and her business partner, hospice social worker Henry Fersko-Weiss, founded Inelda in 2015 to train doulas and promote their use in hospices, hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters. Their training program covers topics like vigil planning, active listening and doula self-care. Part of what doulas do is open the conversation about death and loss, topics that can often be taboo or deeply uncomfortable for the dying or their family. \u201cCan you imagine if a woman was going through labor and no one around her was talking about it or preparing for it? There\u2019d be an uproar if we treated birth like we treat death,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cYou have to talk about it. You\u2019re dying and you\u2019re no longer going to be here.\u201d Doulas help their patients plan out their deaths: talking with them about their wishes, and how they would like to spend their last day. Some prefer to die in a hospital, others at home. They decide who they want around them, whether it\u2019s with all their family and friends, or a religious figure, or alone. They choose the details of the setting, whether they want to hear music, whether they want to have someone hold their hand, and what rituals \u2013 religious or secular \u2013 they want performed. Doulas often also perform legacy work, the practice of guiding the dying to create tangible artifacts to leave behind for their loved ones. Sometimes, it\u2019s a photo album, a collection of recipes, or a video archive. One of Rakow\u2019s patients wrote a series of letters to her pregnant daughter\u2019s unborn child, expressing her hopes and wishes for a granddaughter she knew she would never meet. As death approaches, doulas are tasked with maintaining a sense of calm for the dying and those around them. \u201cOne of my patients this past spring, as he was transitioning, he started to vomit,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cI reminded everyone that when a woman is laboring a birth, sometimes she vomits. It\u2019s the body\u2019s natural way. Let\u2019s just make him comfortable.\u201d Finally, the last part of a doula\u2019s work comes a few weeks afterwards, when the doula meets with the deceased\u2019s loved ones to reprocess and discuss everything that has occurred. \u201cIt\u2019s after the casserole brigade has come and gone, and everyone\u2019s gone back to work,\u201d Kirillin said. \u201cWe talk about grief and bereavement. You\u2019re not going crazy. You can be happy and sad in the same moment. There is no timeline.\u201d Of course, the practice of guiding the dying on their final journey is not new. Death is not an unknown phenomenon, and the act of tending to the dying has existed as long as human civilization itself. Marek has a theory for why the need for a formalized approach to death has manifested now, in these particular circumstances \u2013 why the dying feel the need to contract a trained professional, rather than being able to rely on a more organic source of support. \u201cIn America, a few generations ago, our communities were doing this work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason the role is showing up in a formalized way now is that we don\u2019t have those community ties any more, not in the same way, and certainly not the same level of responsibility to each other as used to be woven into our communities.\u201d Kirillin agreed: \u201cI would love for our culture to never need me,\u201d she said. Much of doula work is the very definition of emotional labor, and though Janie Rakow suspects some doulas feel conflicted about taking money for their services, she sees the profession as no different from that of therapists or hospice workers. \u201cI had one of my patients tell me I wasn\u2019t charging them enough,\u201d she said, though Inelda also encourages pro bono work, and many doulas serve purely on a volunteer basis. She also cautions her doulas not to take on too many cases in a row, and to be cognizant of their own mental health. But, she said, the act of tending to the dying is not as depressing as many assume; rather, it can be very rewarding. \u201cWhen you sit with a dying person and they take their last breath, it is as amazing and awe-inspiring as someone taking their first,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cIt is important, and sad, and needs to be cherished.\u201d Gregory Gelhorn passed away in September 2018. He spent his last day in his home, surrounded by his family. Together, they watched a movie and listened to 90s prog-rock.
