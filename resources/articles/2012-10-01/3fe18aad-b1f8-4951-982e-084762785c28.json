While this is tough news for manufacturers, lower prices have spurred a steady growth in solar power installations in the US, especially in rooftop systems for the residential market. This sector has shown incremental growth over the past four quarters. Not only is this good news for renewable energy advocates, but also for solar installers and the companies that serve this market like San Francisco-based Clean Power Finance. The company estimates that more than a third of residential solar deals in the US now flow through its online marketplace, where solar sales professionals can develop quotes, design the system and arrange for financing. Serial technology entrepreneur, Gary Kremen, founded the company in 2007. His earlier successes included the dating site Match.com. Nat Kreamer, chief executive at Clean Power Finance, says Kremen wanted to create an online marketplace for sellers and investors. \"Gary envisioned a business that connected companies selling and installing solar with companies financing solar via an online software platform that improved access to solar financing.\" Homeowners interested in solar power can be scared away by the hefty upfront installation costs. That's why many deals now depend on third party financing using leases or power purchase agreements. Because installers don't always have the resources to provide financing, they look to Clean Power Finance to serve as matchmaker bringing together projects with investors. Kreamer says the company strives to offer multiple financing products that are tailored to fit specific consumer needs and credit requirements. The company's practice is to charge fixed, transparent transaction fees. \"We make more money when our customers sell more financing,\" he says. \"We are profitable when our partners make money.\" Typically, the organisation that finances the system will retain ownership. The homeowner pays no upfront cost for the installation, but instead pays a monthly fee for the system usually below what they were paying the local utility for electricity from the grid. Clean Power Finance says it now manages some half a billion dollars on behalf of project finance investors, including a $75m fund for Google. Beyond simplifying the financing process, the company is working in other areas to speed the uptake of rooftop solar power. For instance, project developers often find that working through the maze of local zoning and permitting requirements can add time and cost to the project. With a $3m grant from the US Department of Energy, Clean Power Finance recently completed a database of local building regulations that covers more than 7,500 US post codes. Once launched, the database will be free to use for anyone in the industry. The 2012 Global Cleantech 100 was created by the Cleantech Group.
