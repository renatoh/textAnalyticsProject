At lunchtime yesterday it emerged that a secret company called Cubic Expression had built a 6.8% stake in the world's biggest soccer club, making it the second-biggest shareholder. The club was at a loss to identify the Cubic consortium, and rumours swirled, centred on the usual suspects: the super- rich collectors of trophy assets such as the Sultan of Brunei and the men from across the Irish Sea who have made millions from mixing business with pleasure, gambler and currency trader JP McManus, Celtic FC boss Dermot Desmond and John Magnier, who controls the world's most successful thoroughbred breeding stud from his HQ in Coolmore, Co Tipperary. By tea time Messrs Magnier and McManus, both long-term Man U fans, had owned up. Some \u00a330m had been splashed out on the Red Devils - but it was purely for investment purposes. It is, likely as not, a wise buy. Love 'em or hate 'em, Man U is the biggest name in world soccer. In a recent survey of team \"brands\", Manchester United was the sole non-US name in a league dominated by baseball and American football. New chief executive Peter Kenyon believes they have barely scratched the surface of its commercial potential in the vast Far East markets. Nike - no fool when it comes to spotting value - is about to begin a \u00a3300m, 13-year merchandising deal with the club. Vodafone paid some \u00a330m to get its name on the team's shirts. The club is about to start a roadshow to explain to City investors why they should become Man U fans. Mr Magnier and Mr McManus have got in first. The big question now is whether they might move from passive investors to aggressive bidders. If so, they have a trump card up their sleeves, in the form of Sir Alex Ferguson. Sir Alex has made it clear he wants to stay with the club and is known to fancy himself as a Beckenbauer-style football businessman. His potential as a tough financial wheeler-dealer should not be underestimated. He is a legendary negotiator, having honed his skills as a Govan shop steward, and one of his sons is a Goldman Sachs banker. There have been multiple rumours in the past that Ferguson &amp; Son have done their own sums for a bid. Magnier and McManus would need to carry the fans with them if they were to make a move, and what better way than with Sir Alex onside?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
