At least, that\u2019s the impression you probably have of the 2019 Great British Bake Off winner, David Atherton. Wrong. In person, he\u2019s an adventurous extrovert with a hippy streak. \u201cMost of my practices I did in my pants while eating pizza and watching RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. The person in the edit is not me,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end, it showed me singing to myself and dancing around, but actually I did that the whole way through. I am calm and methodical, but I\u2019m not particularly reserved.\u201d Atherton\u2019s triumph \u2013 he didn\u2019t win a showstopper while the hotly tipped finalist Steph Blackwell was star baker four times \u2013 is all the more remarkable because he was a reserve applicant (as was his co-finalist Alice Fevronia), drafted in to replace a dropout just two weeks before the show began. Yet the 36-year-old health adviser is such an experienced and confident cook (\u201cOttolenghi is my absolute hero,\u201d he says, and he is a big fan of baker Dan Lepard), he didn\u2019t panic or even change any social plans. \u201cThe weekend before the show, I decided to cycle to Paris. It was good for my headspace.\u201d A fitness fanatic, he had made his stunning snake cake only once before the opening show. \u201cMy thought was that if you\u2019ve tried something and it\u2019s worked, don\u2019t keep on practising it, because if you try it again and it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s just going to stress you out. A lot of Bake Off is your mental strength.\u201d He thought dessert week might be his undoing. \u201cSweet, fancy, fluffy desserts are not my thing. I like robust flavours and hearty bakes. I like breads. If I do a cake, I want it to be a carrot cake. If I do biscuits, I want them to be spicy.\u201d Judge Paul Hollywood wasn\u2019t initially a fan of his flavours. \u201cPaul has, I think, quite simple tastes. He likes really obvious flavours \u2013 chocolate and caramel and raspberry and white chocolate and lemon.\u201d Yet Atherton won a handshake and is happy to return the compliment: \u201cHe\u2019s very technical. I always agreed with their constructive criticisms. He was really helpful with tips. He must enjoy teaching because he\u2019s really good at that.\u201d While all around him were dropping their creations or gasping as they ran out of time, the cheerful, unfazed Atherton always seemed to finish with a few moments to clean his workbench. Is he really this perfect \u2013 prissy even \u2013 in real life? Not at all. \u201cI\u2019m not that clean and tidy. I don\u2019t like showering. I never wear shoes. I\u2019ve not washed my hair in more than 15 years. I didn\u2019t go to a hairdresser until I was about 28. I think these things are healthy. \u201cI\u2019m very hippy and outdoorsy. I love talking about my bowels and anything disgusting and medical.\u201d His Bake Off persona only shows a sliver of his interests \u2013 and hardly nods to his adventures. A trained nurse, he lives in south London and works for Voluntary Services Overseas. He has a post-graduate degree in wilderness and expedition medicine. And he has travelled around Africa, living in Malawi for two years. \u201cI left home at 18 and went to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. I\u2019ve been evacuated from two wars, once by the British special forces, once by the Americans. I went to Ethiopia when it was in a state of emergency and 10,000 people were arrested. I was in Nigeria during massive demonstrations and we were in lockdown for three days. I\u2019ve had malaria nine times. I\u2019ve been quarantined in a shack in New Guinea for a week because I got a violent strain of measles. I\u2019ve lived in a lot of countries and I really like that adventurous lifestyle.\u201d No wonder he didn\u2019t flap under pressure in the tent. What about the comments that he looked arrogant? \u201cI was never smug. You\u2019re so nervous that whatever your face is, it\u2019s probably just you trying to be composed. I didn\u2019t know I pouted, but I do. Get over it.\u201d One of five children, Atherton was brought up by strict evangelical parents in Whitby, North Yorkshire. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to watch TV. There was a period where we were allowed to watch one programme a day and you had to circle it in the Radio Times. We had breakfast every morning as a family of seven and my dad did a bible study and everyone had to pray at the end. Some of the things were so nice. We\u2019d play board games and do crafts and cooking together. It was a very loving family and we spent a lot of time together.\u201d His mother was health-conscious and cooked from scratch. As a result, Atherton grew up vegetarian, without a potato waffle in sight. \u201cIn our lunchbox we never had crisps or chocolate biscuits, it would be nuts and seeds. Figs and prunes would be our sweet things. Carrot sticks. We never had butter or margarine. We never had icing on our cakes. \u201cFor my mum, making bread was a way of keeping us busy. She would make the dough and we would play with it like Play-Doh. She would make rolls and we would make rabbits, cats and crocodiles.\u201d His grandmother taught him to sew, knit and crochet. In the living room of the small flat he has just moved into with his boyfriend, Nik, he proudly shows me the practical but stylish things he has crafted: a quilt, bowls and platters (\u201cmy Ottolenghi salad plates\u201d), a table and bench (\u201cHonestly, it took about 20 minutes\u201d). He met Nik, a brand manager who helps him with social media, on a dating site. They are both into fitness. \u201cOur second date was a 100km London to Brighton bike ride. When he agreed to that, I was: \u2018Brilliant, this is it.\u2019 We did it not realising it was the big charity one, which was great because all the roads were closed.\u201d Atherton came out seven years ago by writing to his parents. He chose this method, he says, to give them time to process the news. \u201cThe reaction that someone might have from it being sprung on them might not be the reaction they\u2019d want to have if they\u2019d considered it. You\u2019ve been thinking about it for ages, but it\u2019s new for them. I told my parents in a letter and said: \u2018Speak to my twin brother before you speak to me because he wants to be able to answer certain questions first that might seem offensive to me.\u2019 They took it very well.\u201d He loves the fact that LGBT teenagers now contact him for advice, but is aware of the irony. \u201cThey say I\u2019m an inspiration, but I didn\u2019t come out until I was 29. But they\u2019re seeing me after that, where I don\u2019t live with shame any more. I\u2019m really happy. Shame just eats away at you. I encourage people that the soonest time it\u2019s right for them, they should come out, because I didn\u2019t do that and so many people you speak to wish they\u2019d done it earlier.\u201d He says he was frustrated at being \u201ca little bit objectified\u201d early on in Bake Off \u2013 \u201cin certain episodes, I felt like I was just a sexual innuendo\u201d \u2013 but admits he loves the attention he has been getting since it aired. \u201cIn general, I enjoy the buns innuendos. A lot of it is really funny. I mean, I did wear tight trousers every week. It\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t also playing up to this.\u201d He would have liked to wear tight shorts and a vest, but it wasn\u2019t allowed. \u201cApparently armpit hair doesn\u2019t look nice on TV. I think it\u2019s more health and safety, because I said I\u2019d shave my armpits.\u201d His admirers have certainly been upfront. There are lots of fans in the US, where the show has also aired. \u201cThe gay Brits are definitely more dirty. The Americans are: \u2018You\u2019re awesome.\u2019 The Brits are: \u2018I want to fill you with my buttercream.\u2019 I\u2019ve not just had dick pics, I\u2019ve had videos of people masturbating.\u201d Aside from the Bake Off innuendo, there were real friendships on show. Atherton, Henry Bird and Michael Chakraverty formed a \u201cleast laddy lads\u2019 club\u201d (with Fevronia an honorary member) that lives on through Instagram. \u201cWe would ring each other during the week as things went wrong. I\u2019m not embarrassed to say that Henry practised one of my bakes for me \u2013 the Aperol domed tart. It was my recipe, but I didn\u2019t have time. He\u2019d gone out the week before and had time to do everything. He sent exhaustive notes. Every two or three minutes were accounted for.\u201d Atherton thinks this \u201ccamaraderie between the bakers\u201d brought a warmth to the show. \u201cYou could see that we were helping each other and people weren\u2019t really very competitive. I think that helped, especially in the climate of division and Brexit. I think the public have really liked that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
