The Swan is a lockdown offering from Birmingham Royal Ballet. Relayed in split-screen, a pianist (Jonathan Higgins), cellist (Ant\u00f3nio Novais) and dancer (C\u00e9line Gittens) \u2013 all in their separate homes \u2013 perform Mikhail Fokine\u2019s The Dying Swan, with a surprise ending. The short solo, set to Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019 Le Cygne, was created in 1905 for the legendary ballerina Anna Pavlova, and it captures the ephemeral otherworldliness of the ballerina\u2019s art, as well as ballet\u2019s enduring image of the fluttering, beautifully doomed white swan. There\u2019s great intimacy in inviting an audience into your home, close enough to Gittens to see the seams of her tights. Just as well, this solo is all about the details: the barely moving bourr\u00e9es set to a gentle simmer, the slightest acceleration or pause in the swoop of her arms, the engrossing undulations of shoulder blades. There\u2019s a single moment of melodrama when an arm is flung to the floor and Gittens looks like a silent-movie heroine. A choreographic intervention by BRB director Carlos Acosta means this is no longer a dying swan but one who, in the final moments, raises her head, hand and heart in hope. It sounds cheesy, but it\u2019s lovely. When a dancer herself is transported, so can we be, too. There\u2019s something pleasantly jarring about the combination of sublime art and prosaic domestic details \u2013 radiator, light switch, the pot plant Gittens brushes past as she dances into frame. This collision of the ordinary and the exceptional, the magical and mundane, brings human connection and fantastical escapism all in the space of 165 seconds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
