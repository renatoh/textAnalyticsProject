Paul Cottrell, the assistant general secretary responsible for equality at the Association of University Teachers, said promotion was still based on an \"old boys network\" and women did not feel supported in the process. The Athena Survey of Science Engineering and Technology (ASSET) 2003, launched today in Bristol, found that at lecturer level or above, men are more likely to be encouraged to apply for senior positions than women. Some 43% of women said they felt disadvantaged when it came to promotion, while 45% of them felt that women were disadvantaged on salary. The survey, which received responses from roughly 5% of UK academics working in science, engineering and technology at lecturer level or above, also revealed that women feel more isolated in their working environments. Around 55% of women professors agreed that their senior colleagues were supportive, compared with 75% of men, while 55% of the women felt socially integrated within their department, compared with 77% of their male colleagues. Mr Cottrell said although there was less direct discrimination now, the university sector was \"full of institutional sexism\". \"We've been charting the gender pay gap for a number of years. In the last few years it's widened and it's becoming more deeply entrenched,\" he said. \"Promotion is based on an old boys network and women feel they are not supported through the promotion process. There is a feeling that with the emphasis on research and RAE ratings, particularly in Russell group universities, it may disadvantage women who are often, but of course not always, more involved in teaching. Funding puts intense pressure on research and that can disadvantage women.\" However, Julia Goodfellow, head of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, said: \"It's a problem of society not just of science. It's a problem of all professionals. People have to work hard, and it's not compatible for home life.\" She added that women faced different problems in different areas of science. In biology as many women entered the discipline as men, but numbers waned the further up the career ladder they progressed - an effect she called the \"leaky pipeline\" model. In hard sciences, such as physics and chemistry, the problem began much earlier in schools. Women were not applying for degrees, she said. \"Women are turned off, so something's happening in schools and in undergraduate university.\" Last month, the University of Stirling became the first institution to break the male hold over academic leadership when it announced that its four most senior posts were now filled by women. Professor Christine Hallett was recently announced as Stirling's new vice-chancellor, joining the chancellor, Dame Diana Rigg, the chairman of the university court, Dr Doris Littlejohn and the president of the university's students' association, Esther Kavanagh. The Athena group is a government-backed body that champions the rights of women in science engineering and technology."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
