Richard works for a prestigious global consultancy firm. He has been highly successful and is well thought of by his firm. And yet over lunch he was expressing many frustrations. He was feeling burnt out and spending less and less time at home. By now almost all of his social life revolved around the office and he had less and less in common with his old friends. And yet he knew that maintaining the hard working, dispassionate, yet driven facade was key to him making partner. As our lunch progressed he also began to ponder whether this approach was also beginning to alienate clients: he had recently received feedback from two clients that his team were seen as arrogant and unapproachable. In sixteen years of working to change the way organisations operate, I have found Richard's story to be a common one. It seems a strange paradox. In so many ways work can bring out the best in us, provide unparalleled opportunities, give us the chance to hang out with people we like, learn new skills and get exposure to things we would never normally encounter in our everyday lives. So why is it, then, that in a recent ICM survey, three-quarters of people said they would stop working if they won the lottery? There is no doubt that for many people, work is an enriching experience. However, what many people dislike about organisational life is the almost universal expectation that compromise is needed to survive and thrive. Indeed, for many successful people, the very things that ensured they rose through the ranks are now undermining their levels of happiness and limiting their effectiveness. 'Workplace diseases' People fall into certain traps or develop \"workplace diseases\". Some are easier to spot than others. There are those with Superman Syndrome, with impossible expectations for themselves and others. There are the Jargon Junkies, desperately relying on the latest jargon to impress others or avoid talking about a subject. I suggested to Richard he had caught one of these workplace diseases. In Richard's case, my diagnosis is that he suffers from chameleonitis. Chameleonitis occurs when an individual adapts their behaviour and attitudes to fit in with the corporate environment. In other words, when people join organisations, they quickly learn to adopt the traits associated with success, be they superficial (such as dress and language) or more significant (such as Richard's prioritisation of work over his family and social life). In moderation, this is perfectly normal and a key element of social success. It is often unconscious and difficult to monitor or control. Sometimes it is only friends and family who see how much of their original selves people give up in the process. What are we giving up? The first step is to understand an organisation's culture. By assigning colours to the major organisational traits, one can identify which mix of colours best fits an organisation. For example, red (achievement driven) cultures value \"getting on with it\" and achieving the task. Attributes that are successful in red cultures include drive, focus, directness and practicality. In this kind of culture, activity and achievement are highly valued. Yellow (humanist) cultures tend to be people focused. They value consensus and involvement. Decisions tend to be taken through discussion and it is seen as important that each individual can air their views. In this kind of culture, upsetting or alienating people will be strongly discouraged. Blue (professional) cultures value professional expertise. They promote and reward the best trained and most skilled expert, and tend to devalue attributes not directly linked to the profession itself (for example in a hospital medical excellence may be valued but not management skills). Richard's organisation is a mix of \"blue\" and \"red\". As a result successful consultants are seen to be driven, highly rational and constantly able to demonstrate their expertise. Any signs of weakness or emotion or lack of focus are treated with suspicion, and as a result Richard has become less empathetic and probably less able to relax and enjoy life as the years have gone on. As the recent feedback shows this distant, driven personality is potentially also having a negative impact on clients. Other organisations will have a different bias. For example, much of the education sector has a strong \"yellow\" tinge and has responded with suspicion to the imposition of \"red\" tools such as league tables and perfor-mance management. Each organisation exerts different pressures and encourages people to change and exaggerate different elements of our personalities. Some are more susceptible to this pressure than others. But what actually causes chameleonitis? One of the most powerful forces behind chameleonitis is the tendency of an organisation or society to reject misfits. We call this the organisation's immune system. The immune system often operates powerfully through the informal culture of the organisation. For example, macho organisations can ridicule \"touchy feely\" behaviour or outward expressions of concern for other people. But the immune system can also become hard-wired into organisations through recruitment and appraisal processes. One organisation has a startling 128 competencies to assess its leaders - small wonder its managers feel a pressure to adapt. Some organisations exert a stronger pressure than others. We call it the \"fit in or shove off\" (or FISO) pressure. These are the organisations with the strongest cultures and often generate fierce loyalty in their employees. That does not make it a good thing. A strong culture resists diversity and opposes behaviour that does not fit. If an organisation is slow to adopt new behaviour and listen to its \"misfits\", this can hamper its ability to innovate and adapt to changing markets. Whiff of bureaucracy Take a major retailer which has grown rapidly on the back of good products and efficient systems. It knows the next improvement will come from offering warmer, more personalised customer service. Yet it has a red culture with a strong whiff of bureaucracy (\"grey\"). Its staff are drilled in efficiency and sticking to the rule book - and its managers are the same. The only way it can improve its service is to create a warmer, more people-centred, culture (\"yellow\"). Not surprisingly many companies are looking to change their culture. There is a growing demand for tips, tools and services that help companies achieve this. Amazon stocks more than 1,000 books on the subject. And yet many such initiatives will founder on the resistance of the immune system. What is the cost to individuals? Richard is just starting to realise the trap he is in. As with most successful people, he has adopted behaviour most likely to enable him to achieve. In doing so, he has been blind to what he has pushed out. The cost is becoming apparent, both at home and at work. The underlying irony is that analysing those at the top of organisations you find an increasing preponderance of individuality. It seems that conforming can get you so far - but the ultimate prize goes to those who, recognising chameleonitis setting in, rediscover a sense of self. \u00b7 Why Work is Weird by Jerry Connor and Lee Sears is published by Cyan Books at \u00a312.99 Self assessment: do you battle to blend in? Read each of the following statements about your behaviour at work, grading your response to each one according to the scale below. Then total up your cumulative score at the end 1 Never 2 Rarely 3 Occasionally 4 Often 5 Frequently 1) I am a different character at home than I am at work 2) I find I have increasingly less in common with my old friends 3) I tend to follow workplace fashions and fads 4) I can justify behaviour I would have disapproved of in the past 5) I find myself using the office jargon without realising it 6) I believe that to \"get on\" I need to be seen to fit in 7) I behave in ways that I think others (or my boss) want me to 8) I feel embarrassed about some of my attitudes or hobbies and hide them from colleagues 9) I always do \"the social thing\" in the office even when I don't want to 10) I find myself judging others for not fitting in 11) There are some changes in myself since being here that I do not like 12) I do things I don't agree with without challenging myself 13) I find I agree with many of the attitudes and opinions expressed at work How you rate 50 or more You are a slave to the Man. Your prospects may be buoyant but can you actually remember where your home is? There is a world outside work - you need to rediscover it, fast. 35 to 50 While not exactly a stranger to your loved ones, you exhibit strong chameleonistic tendencies at work. Is your job taking over your life? 20 to 35 Your job is important to you, but not the be-all-and-end-all. Work, family and friends take equal billing in your life - a healthy balance. Keep it up. 20 or less Work is just a means of paying your bills. You are not ambitious, nor are you ashamed of it. Your life begins the moment you leave the workplace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
