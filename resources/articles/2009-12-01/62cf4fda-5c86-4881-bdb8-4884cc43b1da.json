The most inspirational: The Barbican's continued and inspiring BITE seasons included the mighty Roman Tragedies, one of the best shows of the year and one that I'd predict will be hugely influential on practice here. The shows that made me cry: For the Best, Mark Storrer's extraordinary examination of living with illness and death at the Unicorn. For me, it was the best show of year by far \u2013 and one largely ignored because it was for children. Also right up there was Love Letters Straight From Your Heart from Uninvited Guests, a piece of participatory performance which is going out on tour next year. Best surprises: That Propeller's Merchant of Venice set in a male prison really worked; Eastern Angles's Return to Akenfield; Matthew Kelly turning into a genuinely superb actor and Australian circus company Circa. People and companies to watch: Action Hero who proved themselves with A Western and Watch Me Fall; Coney, agents of adventure who made Small Town Anywhere; Alex Fleetwood and Hide and Seek, Kings of England whose Where We Live and What We Live For is a delight, Lundah and Seitl whose Rotating in a Room of Images was a hit at BAC's Burst, Nick Payne's If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet was brilliant at the Bush, Vanishing Point's Matthew Lenton, Filter (doing Three Sisters at the Lyric), fledging outfits such as Belt Up and The River People, and the rise of companies such as The Miniaturists and Nabakov, who may well change the way new writing is produced. What I want for Christmas: For whichever government is in power after the next election, to understand that every penny put into theatre is an investment that pays dividends that are about much more than just money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
