Formerly the Xerox Teens (until their choice of name was nobbled by a multinational), their music throws together art punk, big beats, steel drums, tweeting birds and at least one song about swapping a favourite Czechoslovakian hat for a set of teeth. Their crazed collages initially make as much sense as Spike Milligan's quips must have made to the 1950s comedy establishment, but they repay repeated listens. Their power lies in drummer Pinstripe's jerky rhythms, which propel the band's adventures without lingering anywhere very long, which is sometimes a good thing. Still, if Round's demented screams aren't to your taste, something like Onkawara (imagine a metal LCD Soundsystem with a nervous disorder) will be along any moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
