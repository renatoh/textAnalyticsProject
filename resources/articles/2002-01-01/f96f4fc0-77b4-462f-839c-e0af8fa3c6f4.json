No one has dared to do it since, although Tiger Woods might have been justified in the US Open of 2000, albeit only after the third round, when he led by 10. Yesterday it was the turn of Retief Goosen, but unfortunately the South African is such a modest man that the thought of such a boast would never have crossed his mind. Despite the fact that he led by 13 shots after three rounds of the Johnnie Walker Classic here at Lake Karrinyup in Perth, the best he could muster before embarking on his final round was: \"I am very surprised that I am this far ahead. \"I am looking forward to the final round. It is going to be a great day. I'll see if I can put another good round together and see where we end up.\" And if that is boring to read, it was even more so when delivered in the flat monotones affected by most Afrikaners. Goosen duly manufactured a one-over-par 73, and with his 14-under-par 274 aggregate won by eight from Pierre Fulke, by nine from Sergio Garcia and by 12 from another South African, Ernie Els. But there was not a hint of inspiration during the entire 18 holes and the only moments of excitement for the spectators came when he opened with a double-bogey six, driving into a bush and needing a penalty drop at the 1st, and then when he found water with his second at the 15th. Other than that it was a dreary day at the office. Goosen shuffled the papers around on his desk, found that nothing much needed his attention and went home early. In terms of personality he is Holiday Inn Man, bland but effective and the same this week as he was last and will be next week. Herewith one example. All week the 284yd par-four 14th has been downwind and all week the pros have routinely been driving the green. Goosen himself had birdied the hole in two of the first three rounds and yesterday he arrived there leading by 10. Did the driver come out? Was crowd-pleasing on the agenda? No it did not, and no it was not. A nice safe iron down the middle, a nice safe iron on to the green and two, nice, putts for a nice par four. The trouble is that nicely seems to do it. Since Goosen won the US Open in June last year he has played 16 European Tour events, has won four and finished in the top 10 13 times: results of which any golfer could be proud. He had this tournament won after his third-round 63, a course record that beat the 64 established by Gary Player. It was a round that was virtually fault-free - the best he had ever played, Goosen said - and it spreadeagled the field. That evening at a sponsor's function Jos Vanstiphout, the Belgian sports psychologist who counsels Goosen, was asked what he had said or done to bring about such a score. \"Me?\" he said. \"Look, I may be good, but I'm not God.\" And was Goosen ecstatic after a win that takes him back to where he left off at the end of last season, at the top of the European order of merit? Well, he did at least smile and said: \"I managed to hang in there. It was nice to pull it off.\" Fulke holed three putts of 35 feet and over during yesterday's round to finish second and Garcia holed, he felt, nothing at all to finish third. Fulke in general played with a confidence that he felt had been lacking last season when all he could think about was making his debut in the Ryder Cup. \"I was scared of not performing well last September,\" he said, \"but I promise you it will be better this year. Obviously today I was playing for second place but I hadn't touched a club for nine weeks, so it's a good effort.\" Garcia said: \"I couldn't make a single putt. What can you do? The way I hit the ball and hit the shots I should have finished second easily.\" There was encouragement, though, in the way some of the younger Europeans played. The Promising Poms' overall leaderboard read: Simon Dyson, one under par, joint fifth; Nick Dougherty, level par, joint eighth; Jamie Donaldson, two over, joint 14th; and Justin Rose, three over, joint 17th."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
