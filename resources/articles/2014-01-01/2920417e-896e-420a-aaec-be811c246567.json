Like Robert Glasper \u2013 and Herbie Hancock before them \u2013 Cary is a jazz-steeped artist (star vocalist Abbey Lincoln's accompanist for over a decade) who also likes cutting-edge technology, creative pop and hip-hop. Four Directions takes in a waltz dedicated to the late great singer Betty Carter, a Tony Williams Lifetime theme delivered in squealy Fender Rhodes tones, and on the bubbling Todi's Blues an east/west fusion of vivacious elan. The Carter tribute takes off in buoyant acoustic-piano runs and McCoy Tyner-like trills, and Cary gets a remarkable sound somewhere between a sax and vocoder on the tranquil Open Baby. Regular jazzers put off by his eclecticism and techie enthusiasms should note that there's a lot of straightahead jazz piano here too - and on a track such as the lyrical yet restless Tanktified, Cary shows how creatively he can stretch cool piano-jazz swingers over complex and cutting-edge rhythms, producing music that sounds old and new at once."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
