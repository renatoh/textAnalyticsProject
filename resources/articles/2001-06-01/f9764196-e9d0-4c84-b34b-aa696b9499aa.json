Of course, it must conform to certain standards of conduct and disclosure set by the regulators. Increasingly, it must also demonstrate that its governance satisfies the demands of investors. But must it also pursue profit as its ultimate objective? This week Body Shop, purveyor of exotic, environmentally friendly beauty treatments to the masses, disclosed that it was subject to a takeover approach that might lead to the end of its life as a quoted company. If Mexico's Grupo Omnilife succeeds with its bid, it is unclear whether this would represent a victory for the City \"dinosaurs\" derided by Body Shop's founder, Anita Roddick. Body Shop's life as a quoted company has been an eventful one, in large part because of the faultline in its management's business objectives. It is all very well championing the environment, opening the eyes of the consumer to its abuse, and making a little profit in the process. It is quite another to do all of this and satisfy external investors who are hungry for a little profit to become a lot. At its peak Body Shop's net profit just topped \u00a320m on revenues of about \u00a3300m. Among the retail giants it remained a pygmy, and it is to the credit of Mrs Roddick and her colleagues that the company had a publicity punch above this weight. However, these profits - while modest by the standards of quoted retailers - were sufficient to attract the scorn of hardline activists who hurled charges of profiteering and exploitation at management. In typical market fashion, this week's takeover disclosure follows only weeks behind confirmation of a sharp fall in profits. This reverse was the result of classic errors in the notoriously fickle world of retailing - poorly judged new products, lax inventory control and complacency about brand positioning. In the glare of the quoted spotlight, it is difficult for any management team to grit its teeth and settle down to the long haul of recovery. Anita Roddick, her husband and one original investor between them own about half of Body Shop's equity, effectively giving them thick insulation from external pressures. However, fund managers are a relentless lot - that's their job - and are adept at maximising leverage from a minority position. The prospect of \u00a3150m between the three founders must be pretty appealing, then. Body Shop's environmental crusade has been heart-on-sleeve stuff. The motives of other unconventional businesses have been more opaque. Who can tell, for example, what makes Sir Richard Branson's empire tick? Virgin's finances resist inquiry. It is unclear whether it wants to provide a public service or make money, or whether it believes it can do both simultaneously. Branson flirted briefly with the stock market in the 1980s, only to go private once again with finger-jabbing on both sides. Whatever his standing among the public at large, in the City Sir Richard is always likely to be bracketed with those moguls deemed a touch too racy for the public exchange. Yet the stock market continues to act as a magnet for entrepreneurs of all shapes and sizes. It is easy to see why. The pool of available equity finance is much greater and its cost much lower in the quoted arena than the private one. Furthermore, debt finance is easier to secure if it has a substantial quoted equity anchor. The stock exchange is a cosmopolitan place which has proved capable of harbouring companies across the full range of industries, of all sizes, and with diverse management approaches. The vast majority, however, pursue growth in shareholder value as their overarching objective. Which simplifies the work of the average fund manager, tasked as he or she is with growing the value of their clients' portfolios. Over the past 10 years, however, there has developed a mini investment industry devoted to\"ethical\" investment. In practice this has tended to mean the avoidance of companies that operate in industries deemed unethical - such as armaments, tobacco, gambling - or that fail to meet specified ethical standards in their operations. There are too few \"pure\" ethical plays to populate a portfolio, hence this reductionist approach. Nearly all of the large holdings in the average ethical fund are in companies for which profit remains the prime motivator. Equity ownership confers the right to determine the way in which a company conducts its business. In this way investors are able to share in dreams, if they so desire. These dreams are not only green ones. As a football supporter, you can own a piece of \"your\" team, as a techie you can participate in the technology revolution, as a headbanger you can own a sliver of Iron Maiden's success. In each instance, profiteering may come low down on your personal agenda. Dispassionate investors need to tread carefully through crowds of fanatics. The trick is to identify those management teams able to let their heads rule their hearts - and to look for checks and balances. Manchester United's apparent refusal to allow its football manager on to the PLC board is laudable, ensuring a continued tension between the twin goals of sporting success and profit that has proved so successful to date. Perhaps Anita Roddick will find even greater environmental zeal if the ultimate responsibility for Body Shop's financial fortunes moves \"upstairs\".
