Little attention was paid to the small print when Chancellor Gordon Brown announced in his Budget there would be an additional \u00a3300m funding for elite athletes for 2012. While UK Sport, the agency responsible for distributing money to Britain's medal prospects, received a \u00a3200m cheque from the Treasury, Brown said the other \u00a3100m was to be raised through private-sector sponsorship. This week the House of Commons public accounts committee highlighted the size of the task: \"UK Sport currently generates no sponsorship income, so the aim of securing \u00a3100m of sponsorship ahead of 2012 is challenging. The Department [of Culture, Media and Sport] and UK Sport should draw on specialist fundraising expertise [and] see what lessons can be learned from others - from the sporting community itself, from other sectors in this country, and from overseas.\" \"Challenging\" is a diplomatic word: competition for Olympic sponsorship is intense, UK Sport says fundraising is not its job and opposition MPs are cranking up the pressure on the government. Raising the cash will be made more difficult by the activities of the London 2012 organising committee, Locog, which is seeking over \u00a3750m towards the \u00a32bn cost of staging the Games. Locog, which is hoping that blue-chip sponsors will provide up to \u00a350m each, has sole rights to the use of the five-ring Olympic branding. Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat sport spokesman, said: \"Raising \u00a3100m is not impossible, but it is very challenging bearing in mind all the other organisations that are fishing in the same pond. The sponsorship budgets of the private sector are already getting tight. The government must raise its game still further if we are to secure the private investment in sports needed to capitalise on the once-in-a- lifetime opportunity of 2012.\" Hugh Robertson, the Conservative sport spokesman, said: \"It is a very big black hole. A lot of people are fishing around in the sponsorship pool and there is potential for massive confusion here. The government needs a proper plan to raise the extra money and to coordinate the multitude of different bodies fishing around in sponsorship markets. It is a mess at the moment.\" Robertson says the chancellor's plans are based on little more than the hope of muddling through, and adds: \"The biggest 25 sponsors will go to Locog and others will sponsor individual sports, like Norwich Union with athletics and Skandia with sailing. Most would run a mile at the prospect of effectively handing over cash to UK Sport with no branding and with its obvious closeness to the government.\" Locog's plans are likely to be approved by the International Olympic Committee by the end of the summer. At least one of its top-tier sponsors should be signed up by March 2007. \"Interest is high and people understand the value of what we are offering,\" a spokeswoman said. Locog has talked to UK Sport and individual governing bodies. \"We are happy to sit around the table, share our expertise and take part in a brainstorming session, but the \u00a3100m for elite athletes is not our responsibility,\" the spokeswoman added. \"Our primary focus is to raise the money to stage the Games - and we own all the rights to the Games and the British teams. We need to be very clear about it.\" That means companies tempted by UK Sport will face draconian restrictions, but Andy Kenny, client services director at the sports marketing agency brandRapport, is optimistic.\"Since London won the 2012 bid, Locog has been flooded with interest - but very few brands will be able to afford to put in the top money for six years. Those that cannot afford to be at the top table will look at the alternatives.\" UK Sport has commissioned external consultants to analyse the sports sponsorship market and Locog's plans. The agency does not want to be sidetracked from awarding lottery cash based on measurements of performance and targets. Last year UK Sport was planning to raise \u00a34m from sponsorship for the Beijing Olympic cycle, but decided against competing with national governing bodies, the British Olympic Association and the British Paralympic Association. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport is optimistic. \"We will get the report from UK Sport at the end of July,\" a spokeswoman says. \"We will make recommendations to the Treasury to be included in the pre-Budget report. We think it is a realistic target and we are confident that it can be raised.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
