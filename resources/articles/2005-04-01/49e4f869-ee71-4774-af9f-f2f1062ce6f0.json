But things change, and that title has long since moved on, passing through Michigan and Japan's industrial heartland in Aichi prefecture. Now, if anywhere can claim to be the world's workshop, it is China's Jiangnan region, home to the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation - the company said to be the only suitor still considering taking on the West Midlands' troubled Longbridge motor plant. It will be difficult for Shanghai Automotive to succeed where BMW, the plant's previous owners, failed. In 2000 the fate of Longbridge became a national political issue when BMW announced its intention to close it down. The government and unions then made heroic efforts to keep Longbridge alive. But in the five years since, its new owners have proved to be inadequate for the task. They have instead presided over the plant's decline. Despite that decline, the only people who have prospered from the rescue deal appear to be the directors who bought the company for \u00a310 in 2000, and have since profited to the tune of millions of pounds in earnings and pension contributions. That makes Longbridge's recent history all the sadder; the directors who arrived hailed as saviours have turned out to be much lesser figures, seemingly out of the reach of reckoning or requital. It may be that Shanghai Automotive can yet be enticed into taking over Longbridge and the MG Rover marques - although that seems less likely given suggestions that the Chinese are balking at a black hole in the accounts. In that case the West Midlands may need to prepare for the worst. The long decline of Longbridge does mean it is now much less important to the region in terms of employment: closure in 2000 was estimated to cost 55,000 jobs. Today, the closure of Longbridge would mean, at the most, 18,000 jobs lost, a sign of how successfully suppliers have diversified, and how far Longbridge's output has shrunk. Sigmund Freud counselled patients against taking major decisions while they were undergoing therapy. Similarly, an election campaign is the worst time to decide Longbridge's fate, given the swath of marginal Labour seats nearby. The best we can hope is that the government makes every effort to find a new owner. Failing that, it would be a better use of the millions the DTI is offering in bridging loans to fund retraining and support, and cushion the blow for the people and local businesses hurt should Longbridge close for good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
