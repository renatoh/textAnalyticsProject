When tuition fees were introduced resistance was anticipated from students. It's happened. Protests have been mounted, marches organised, banners and placards waved. The National Union of Students (NUS) has made the self-evident points about the life-burden of student debt. Government spokespeople have made the self-evident points about the graduate's post-university salary enhancement and the university sector's cash-crunch. Neither side sees the self-evidence of the others' case. Parents, so far, have just done their usual grin-and-bear-it. That's what parents are for, to supply the \"golden cascade\" across the generational gulf that John Major used to eulogise (as a parent, I see it as more of a haemorrhage). But no more Mr Nice Dad. As annual fees have gone up, parents are beginning to ask why it is they must pay for a year's tuition when (in institutions like mine) there is no formal teaching from the end of March to the beginning of October. Is this not short weight? \"How do you get away with it?\" one parent asked me, with the air of a furious shareholder confronting a fat-cat director who had just awarded himself a particularly generous bonus. Convincing answers don't come all that readily. It's a complicated issue, and it will rumble on, ratcheting up every time the fees increase. But it touches on another issue. Namely, how hard do academics actually work? Are they slackers, or as much afflicted by the overwork culture as the rest of Britain? Do they give good value to the tax payer (and parent) who ultimately stumps up for their salary? On the face of it, the figures do not suggest a crushing classroom burden. Some 25 scheduled teaching weeks a year, a three and-a-half-day week (Wednesday is sacrosanct for footer: Friday afternoon for TGIF relaxation), and - on average - a six-hour day. I'm writing this column in my university office. It's mid-afternoon on a weekday in July. If I walked up and down the corridor naked for the next two hours no one would notice: because no one's here but me. The University of Marie Celeste. But that, of course, is not the whole story. Academics typically have a threefold task: teaching, research, and administration. It's never easy to quantify, in total, how many hours are being put in because research activity tends to be left to the academic to assign him/herself and administrative tasks come and go erratically over a career. But, for the purpose of demonstration, I'll take a convenient slice of my own career, the eight years between 1982 and 1990. I was, over that period, employed in America, at the California Institute of Technology. I had a fixed load of four courses a year, representing (these things are precisely laid down in America) 2,880 classroom hours. Add on to that three hours of preparation and marking for every contact hour, and the total teaching tally for that eight-year period is 11,520 hours. I was for three of those years an executive officer of Humanities (equivalent to a Deanship in the UK) which, I estimate, meant 500 hours of active administration. Over the eight years (this is what makes it convenient), I was engaged on one big research task, a companion to Victorian fiction. It comprised, on publication in 1990, some 900 biographical entries and summaries, long and short, of 2,000 works of fiction. Calculating (a modest) three hours apiece (reading, writing, and typesetting) for the entries that comes out at 8,700 hours. Over the eight-year period I also produced five editions and some 60 sizeable reviews and articles: let's say another 700 hours. So how does that total out? 21,420 hours. Or, put another way, 535.5 44-hour weeks. And, taking a 46-week working year, it comes out at eleven and-a-half years' work, done in eight years. Or, put another way, I was working a 58-hour week, from 1982 to 1990, with six weeks' annual holiday. About what I imagine the average bus driver does. Those are, I think, true figures. Of course, if you just took the teaching-contact hours, it looks scandalously light (less than 10 hours a week). But if you factor everything in, it's respectable. The wild-card, of course, is that academics are free to organise so much of their own timetable: particularly with regard to research. And, with a bit of guile, they can duck administration, leaving it to their more conscientious (or less guileful) colleagues. Workaholics will work 100-hour weeks; wankers will do nothing arduous, for years on end. Both specimens can be found in university life. But, on the whole, I would suggest from my personal experience and observation, most academics do a good day's work for a hell of a lot less than a good day's pay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
