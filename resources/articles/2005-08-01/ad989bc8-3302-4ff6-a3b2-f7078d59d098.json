A report from the National Labor Committee, a human rights group, alleges that workers are forced to be at factories for up to 15 hours a day, are paid below the minimum wage and denied holiday, overtime and maternity pay. It was based on interviews with 120 workers at five factories in Shenzhen province. The report says one company, Hung Hing Printing, has one of the worst records in the province for industrial accidents. One 24-year-old woman was crushed to death in 2002 by a hole-punching machine and a man killed when he accidentally touched an exposed mechanism. Crushed hands and fingers from unsafe machinery are common occurrences, it alleges. Interviews and video footage from the plants were supplied by a Hong Kong-based human rights organisation, Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour. \"At one printing factory producing Disney books, there are four to five accidents a week. People lost their fingers and palms,\" said Billy Hung, coordinator of the group. \"But ... the factory just hires new workers and the accidents simply continue.\" Workers said they had to meet targets or lose pay, which meant they usually worked longer than the official 12-hour day. The group claimed workers were paid just 35 cents (20 pence) an hour, below the region's minimum wage of 42 cents an hour. Supervisors are also said to scream insults at workers such as: \"You are a stupid pig.\" According to testimony, workers often faint due to the intense heat and fast-paced work. One said: \"In meetings management would say, 'if you faint, you deserve it and I won't sympathise with you'. \" Disney said it took the allegations \"very seriously\" and had asked the non-profit social auditing firm Verit\u00e9 to investigate. The firm said it would \"take the appropriate actions to remediate violations found\". The report also claims that Disney audits are a sham and that workers are coached on what to say or face being fired. At another firm, Nord Race in the city of Dongguan, staff are paid just 33 cents an hour. The report claims the firm demands 13- to 15-hour shifts, seven days a week, in stifling heat. Workers have no health insurance and if late, they lose half an hour's wages for every minute they miss, it claims. Nord Race denied the claims in a statement to the Associated Press and said it complied with Chinese labour laws. The report has been published at a sensitive time for Disney, just a month before Hong Kong's Disneyland theme park is officially opened."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
