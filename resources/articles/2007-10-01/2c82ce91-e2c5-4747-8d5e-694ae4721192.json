Warnock is Jordan's seventh appointment in seven years, after the sacking of Peter Taylor on Monday. Taylor had 16 months in charge at Selhurst Park and that, according to Jordan, was long enough, with Palace 19th in the Championship after 10 matches. Jordan believes that in Warnock, a long-standing friend, the club have a manager with the pedigree to be a long-term success. \"I've been a big admirer of Neil for some time,\" he said. \"He represents everything I want in a manager - he is a winner and has a desire to be successful. We are a dream ticket for this club. We were not going in the right direction [under Taylor] and the team was not performing the way I want it to perform. Continuity is important but you can't build a building on foundations which are unstable.\" Warnock has been out of work since leaving Sheffield United at the end of last season. He has signed a contract to 2010 and his first game will be at Blackpool a week tomorrow. A return to Bramall Lane awaits on December 29. Warnock said that Palace would be his last job as a manager. \"I had five or six decent offers but I didn't feel it was right to jump straight into the first job. But this is my last job, without a shadow of a doubt. We need to have a little bit of fun and make people smile. The players have to enjoy the experience, as do the fans. I like to have a rapport with the fans.\" Gary Neville has suffered another setback in his rehabilitation programme from seven months of recurrent injury problems. The Manchester United defender was due to play for the reserves against Liverpool last night but had to withdraw on medical advice. The club have described it as a precautionary measure, rather than Neville's condition worsening, but it still represents a demoralising blow for the England right-back, who has not played since hurting himself in a challenge with Bolton's Gary Speed during a 4-1 win for Sir Alex Ferguson's team at Old Trafford on March 17. Neville must now wait until October 24 before his next chance to make his comeback, when United's reserves play Wigan Athletic, and it is not thought he will be in a position to return to the first team until Blackburn Rovers visit Old Trafford on November 11."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
