Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers Association, claimed this week that the eight American and Asian owners of Premier League clubs have discussed the idea. Redknapp said: \"You can't tamper with promotion and relegation. With more foreign owners coming in, what do you need, 14 and they can change the rules? It's going to be scary, isn't it? I don't know what the numbers are. At least 10 [foreign owners in total]. You're going to end up with 14, 15 eventually. Teams are looking to sell their clubs. Everton are looking to sell. If Dave Whelan sells at Wigan the bloke from the local butcher's isn't gonna buy it any more.\" Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Liverpool, Manchester United, Sunderland, Fulham, Queens Park Rangers and Blackburn Roves are all owned by non-UK citizens. The FA has a \"golden share\" in the Premier League which it holds to intervene in such a scenario and Redknapp said: \"The FA have got to be strong, haven't they? They can't let that happen to our game. The only interest [then] would be the top four and Champions League. The rest of it will be like: 'Oh well it doesn't matter, does it?' \"I can't see the fans going for it. Where is the excitement? The relegation battle has been as exciting as anything every year. That last day, when there are teams up at 4.30pm and by 4.40pm they are down. That is what makes our game. Everybody going for it the last day of the season.\" He is, though, sure the 39th game plan \u2013 the notion of playing Premier League games overseas \u2013 will happen in some guise. \"You can't have too many foreign owners coming in here wanting to change our game. You will end up playing loads of games around the world as that will happen. They will take the games to where they want to play them. If you have owners from China, India, Russia, America they will want to take their teams there to play. When you go to Asia now the support and following is amazing.\" Tottenham Hotspur face the Russian League club Rubin Kazan at White Hart Lane on Thursday evening in a Europa League group game with each side heading the standings on four points. Redknapp faces a crisis in central defence with only S\u00e9bastien Bassong and Youn\u00e8s Kaboul fit. Ledley King has a \"slight abductor\" tear, William Gallas a long-term calf problem, Michael Dawson has an achilles injury, and Vedran Corluka a foot problem. Redknapp said he will be forced to rest Kaboul ahead of the game at Blackburn on Sunday. \"The problem is that we have no one else coming back or that will be fit at the weekend, so if one of them gets a knock on Thursday we will be bang in trouble. Maybe Jake Livermore [a midfielder] could play there tomorrow, at a pinch with one of the centre-halves, probably with Bassong.\" Redknapp, who revealed that Spurs players do yoga and Pilates after the 40-year-old goalkeeper Brad Friedel brought his yoga teacher to the club, admitted he will listen to offers for Roman Pavlyuchenko in January. \"If he wanted to go and it was a good offer, then we would look at that for sure. But he's not a player that I'm looking to move.\" Tottenham Hotspur 4-4-1-1 Cudicini; Walker, Livermore, Bassong, Rose; Lennon, Sandro, Carroll, Townsend; Dos Santos; Pavlyuchenko.
