Now comes a superb production by Maria Friedman, astonishingly making her directorial debut, that makes you wonder how anyone could ever have doubted its quality. Perhaps people were fazed by the reverse chronology of Furth's book, based on a play by George S Kaufman and Moss Hart, which starts in 1976 and ends in 1957. In that time, we see how Hollywood producer Franklin Shepard lost his illusions, sacrificed his musical talent and broke up with his old chums, Charley and Mary. But it's precisely the backward momentum that makes the story so moving: the show builds towards a surge of youthful optimism \u2013 symbolised by the three main characters converging on a New York rooftop to watch the Sputnik \u2013 that we know will not be sustained. Sondheim's score is also a miracle of construction: motifs, phrases and even non-musical sounds echo through the evening. To take one tiny example, the clattering typewriter that we hear in Franklin Shepard Inc, in which Charley publicly dissolves his professional partnership with the hero, becomes a symbol of creative fervour in the penultimate number, Opening Doors. What I love about this show is that Sondheim's technical brilliance is harnessed to emotional needs; and that is the point on which Friedman has avidly seized. Instead of fretting about the characters' reverse-ageing, she focuses on the detail of their relationships: witness the shy smile of delight that the young Franklin, impeccably played by Mark Umbers, shoots his first wife (Clare Foster) when asked to play one of his numbers at a glitzy showbiz party. Thanks to the anguished integrity of Damian Humbley's Charley, and the frayed longing of Jenna Russell's Mary, you also believe totally in the slowly dissolving friendship between the three principals. Under the musical direction of Catherine Jayes, the nine-strong band allows us to enjoy the richness of Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations without overwhelming the singers. As so often, a Sondheim musical prospers through an intimate space and a minute attention to textual and emotional detail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
