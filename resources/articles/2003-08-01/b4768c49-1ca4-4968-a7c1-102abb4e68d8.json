He's still the man to beat and has shown that this year.\" Flavio Briatore \"Great season. Huge talent and his experience helps him, even when he has a slight tyre deficiency.\" Eddie Jordan \"My money would be on Michael. He's a huge talent and his form this year as indicated there is no sign of his motivation flagging.\" David Richards \"I'm not a betting person, but if I was of that inclination my money would be on Michael at the end of the season, because of his innate strength of character and the strength of the organisation behind him.\" Strengths GB \"He hardly ever makes mistakes. No obvious weak spots.\" FB \"We all know that Michael is the best. The others sometimes challenge, but his consistency wins out.\" EJ \"Mentally tough beyond belief. Michael never allows anything or anybody to get to him. Michael can turn a fifth place into a third.\" DR \"His form this season has been as good as ever, but his results have been very much dictated by the ebb and flow of the advantage between the two tyre suppliers in formula one. But he remains overwhelmingly the man to beat.\" Weaknesses GB \"Really nothing worth mentioning.\" FB \"Very difficult to find any weak spots.\" EJ \"Michael made a rare mistake in qualifying at Silverstone, but you'd be well advised not to rely on it.\" DR \"Even when he makes the occasional mistake, he can translate it into a decent result.\" How can he win the title? GB \"All he's got to do now is keep his nerve. He's got the consistency, the reliability. And he's ahead on points.\" FB \"It will largely be down to the tyre battle in the closing races, whether Bridgestone bounces back against Michelin.\" EJ \"He has the advantage of being ahead in the points table.\" DR \"I think that Bridgestone could well fight back over the next few races, so in reality Michael could be even stronger over the remaining rounds of the championship.\" Kimi Raikkonen McLaren-Mercedes Points 62 Form 2nd, 6th, retired, 4th, 3rd Performance this season GB \"He's a really interesting character. He's done well, but he's made a few mistakes.\" FB \"Too many errors, but he's certainly a future star.\" EJ \"Fast beyond belief, really a great talent.\" DR \"He has driven well this season, but I think to some extent that his performance in the remaining races may hinge on whether or not the new McLaren eventually makes its race debut at Monza in September. He is obviously a huge talent.\" Strengths GB \"He's absolutely not impressed or intimidated by any of his rivals.\" FB \"Cool and calm. A typical Finn, like Mika Hakkinen.\" EJ \"He has absolutely the right temperament to get to the top.\" DR \"Clearly he has a lot of natural skill and star quality. Weaknesses GB \"Still quite inexperienced when running at the front of the field, and it sometimes shows.\" FB \"Sometimes slightly over-drives what isn't always the most competitive car.\" EJ \"Still makes too many unforced errors. But is learning fast.\" DR \"Yes, I agree. He has made too many mistakes in qualifying, and a couple during the race at Silverstone, as well.\" How can he win the title? GB \"Will need some good luck over the remaining five races.\" FB \"A bit of an outsider now. BMW has more power than Mercedes\" EJ \"With some difficulty. Kimi is paying the price for those mistakes earlier in the year.\" DR \"I wouldn't count him out, but it will be hard for him to catch Michael.\" Juan Pablo Montoya Williams-BMW Points 55 Form 1st, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd, 2nd Performance this season GB \"He's been strong and aggressive, But he still lacks experience at the front.\" FB \"Obviously he's been one of the strongest of the young generation.\" EJ \"Generally I think it's been a pretty good year for Juan Pablo.\" DR \"Another hugely talented, naturally gifted driver. He's done well, but again there's a touch of inconsistency, which he can't afford when racing against Michael.\" Strengths GB \"Just like Kimi, he isn't bothered about eyeballing it out with any of the other top drivers.\" FB \"He's got terrific speed, even if he's still inconsistent.\" EJ \"Just so positive in tight wheel-to-wheel confrontations.\" DR \"Great win at Monaco and strong drives at Silverstone and at N\u00fcrburgring. Never gives up trying.\" Weaknesses GB \"Difficult to be in Michael's shadow. If he says he's going to win the championship, he's arrogant, if he says he's not thinking about it, then they say he's not motivated.\" FB \"Not too many that I can see.\" EJ \"Perhaps not yet quite sufficiently seasoned to win a world championship. Not yet, I would emphasise.\" DR \"It all comes down to that lack of consistency again. Should not have spun away the lead of the Australian grand prix.\" How can he win the title? GB \"Difficult. The problem is that he and Ralf could take points from each other.\" FB \"I think he's a little too far back to catch Michael now.\" EJ \"Not this year, but certainly sometime in the future.\" DR \"He's one of the top performers, of that there is no doubt. But is he seasoned enough to win a title yet? I don't know.\" Ralf Schumacher Williams-BMW Points 53 Form 4th, 2nd, 1st, 1st, 9th Performance this season GB \"Has proved he has the right stuff to win a championship. FB \"Quick, but not consistent enough.\" EJ \"Ralf has the talent, but he's had some unlucky breaks this season. DR \"Like Raikkonen, Ralf has driven superbly in some races, but it's that inconsistency which upsets his overall image.\" Strengths GB \"Very smooth and mature driver.\" FB \"Obviously he is very quick and capable.\" EJ \"Has emerged amazingly well as a potential winner over the past few races.\" DR \"Great skill and natural talent. Has the natural ability to get the results.\" Weaknesses GB \"His inconsistency is probably the only thing which marks him down against his brother.\" FB \"He has to make fewer mistakes if he's going to beat Michael.\" EJ \"Didn't quite manage to maintain his momentum at Silverstone where he failed to score a point for the first time this season. Not quite there yet as a completely rounded talent.\" DR \"Even on a bad day, Michael can produce the sort of stalwart performance which Ralf can't quite achieve.\" How can he win the title? GB \"It's going to be tough, and he has to beat Michael consistently.\" FB \"I think he's going to find it extremely difficult with only five races to go.\" EJ \"If the Williams BMW package can give him a performance edge, he could run Michael very close indeed.\" DR \"It comes back to avoiding that inconsistency. As it does for most of them.\" The panel David Richards Team principal, BAR Flavio Briatore Chairman, Renault F1 Eddie Jordan Proprietor, Jordan Gerhard Berger Director, BMW Motorsport"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
