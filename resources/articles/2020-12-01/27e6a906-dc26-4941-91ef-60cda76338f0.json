Byrt is an occupational therapist from Geelong who has lived in London for the last four years. Like many of the best Australian wines, confectionery and telly, the lamington is a legend at home and a relative nobody away. In the UK it\u2019s occasionally sighted at Aussie barbecues and antipodean-run cafes, or recalled by long-term Neighbours fans as the solution to many of Erinsborough\u2019s fundraising problems, but it\u2019s not the sort of thing you\u2019ll find supermarkets selling in six-packs. But Radio Lamington might be about to change all that. Since launching in London in April they have not only raised the international profile of the iced sponge squares, but helped keep spirits up among the city\u2019s NHS frontliners by donating a box for every one sold. So far they\u2019ve delivered more than 40,000 lamingtons to hospitals around the city \u2013 including to Byrt\u2019s team. \u201cThe highlight for me was watching UK locals admit they thoroughly enjoyed an Australian dessert they had never experienced before,\u201d he says. \u201cIt also was appreciated in the wider sense, in that the work the team does is often thankless.\u201d Radio Lamington is the brainchild of Prue Freeman, the Australian co-founder of London\u2019s Daisy Green restaurant group. Freeman, who grew up on a sheep farm outside Ballarat, moved to London in 2010 to work in finance but always intended to start her own business. By 2012 she was selling coffee and banana bread to city bankers from a bike at the bottom of the Gherkin building. Now Freeman and husband Tom Onions have 12 cafes and restaurants across central London. They\u2019re brightly lit, Australian-inspired venues with upbeat staff and a buzzy atmosphere that\u2019s as much a part of the experience as the menu. All of this meant that, when they were forced to close during London\u2019s first lockdown, it wasn\u2019t so easy to pivot to takeaway. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really set up,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cOur business is more about people coming in and the ambience and brunch doesn\u2019t travel that well.\u201d Staff were sent home and the company\u2019s brand-new kitchen in Paddington was closed. But London\u2019s not an easy place to wait out a pandemic, especially for young hospitality workers who often live in crowded share houses with people they don\u2019t know very well, and no access to gardens or other outdoor space. Cabin fever soon set in. \u201cPeople were going a bit crazy,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cEveryone was at home for long periods of time and we all kept saying, what can we do, how can we help?\u201d In April they decided to reopen the kitchen and start baking for the #FeedtheNHS campaign. Around 25% of London Ambulance Service paramedics are Australians or New Zealanders, and with huge numbers in the hospitals too, lamingtons were the obvious choice. \u201cIt was just something nice that we could do, and a bit of a taste of home,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cThe people working there are doing such a lot for everyone. We just wanted to do something a bit lighthearted in an otherwise dark situation.\u201d \u201cThe first few weeks we were just making what we\u2019d always done, the sort of classic lamington,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cBut over time people started playing around with flavours.\u201d They now do rainbow lamingtons (rainbows have become a symbol of support for NHS workers), pecan pie, tiramisu, lemon and yuzu. There\u2019s even a Golden Gaytime-inspired lamington \u2013 a homage to the classic Australian ice cream with a vanilla sponge, toffee filling and malt biscuit crumb \u2013 to give Australians in London a double dose of two favourite nostalgia foods. As London re-enters tough lockdown restrictions, the lamingtons will keep coming. \u201cOut of everything we make, lamingtons are the most labour intensive,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cThey definitely aren\u2019t the quickest things to make, but they\u2019re worth it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
