A sell-out crowd of just over 10,000 awaits on Saturday after United's \u00a329.3m defender persuaded his new employers to include him in a 15-man squad for the testimonial for the Cherries' director of football Mel Machin. Ferdinand, who arrived at Carrington in a silver Mercedes for his first training session with his new team-mates yesterday, had asked to be involved this weekend after promising Machin, who gave him his first taste of senior football in 1996 as a 17-year-old on loan from West Ham, he would make an appearance. \"Rio phoned me up after completing his move to United and I'm delighted that he will be coming down with the rest of the United squad as was originally intended,\" confirmed Machin, a former Manchester City manager. \"The boy has had a lot on his mind, so I was surprised he was even thinking of us, but that's Rio for you. He said he really appreciated what I had done for him while he was on loan and really wanted to come back.\" Ferdinand's return to his roots could constitute anything from a pre-match kick-about to a substitute's cameo. \"I spoke to him about things last week and he was desperate to come down here and put in an appearance,\" added Machin, who will have the consolation of Juan Sebastian Veron, Ryan Giggs, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Dwight Yorke in the opposing ranks should Ferdinand not emerge from the bench. \"He doesn't know if he will be playing yet but he has been included in the squad and is very keen to play for me. That speaks volumes for the boy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
