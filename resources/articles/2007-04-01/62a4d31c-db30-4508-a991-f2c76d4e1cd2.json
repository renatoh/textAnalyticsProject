Sanchez has been given permission by Northern Ireland to assume the role and if Sanchez keeps Fulham in the Premiership then the Irish Football Association will also have to accept that Sanchez will be appointed full-time. His likely first targets as signings are two Northern Irishmen, Leeds's David Healy and Aston Villa's Steve Davis. Sanchez has brought in Les Reed as his assistant, and Northern Ireland coach Terry Gibson has also signalled he would be keen to take on a role. Reed was sacked by Charlton in December but has coached with Sanchez previously. But the sheer pace of events - Sanchez only returned from a holiday in Austria yesterday afternoon and had not been contacted by Fulham before then - means that other plans will have to be on hold. It is understood that on landing at Heathrow, Sanchez turned on his telephone and went straight to Harrods to see Mohamed Al Fayed, Fulham's owner. The IFA president, Jim Boyce, says Sanchez still wants to honour his contract, which runs until the end of the European Championship campaign, although the situation will be reviewed at the end of the season. Coleman's assistant, Steve Kean, was also sacked on Tuesday night but the future of Fulham's goalkeeping coach, Dave Beasant, appears secure. Sanchez, 47, began his playing career at Reading, whom Fulham visit on Saturday, and enjoyed a successful FA Cup run with Wycombe Wanderers as a manager. But it is his revival of Northern Ireland that has thrust him back into the limelight. He has taken a side seeded six in a seven-team group to the top. Speaking to the Guardian recently, Sanchez said he was confident he could combine club and international roles and though there is a risk in going to Fulham, who have not won for seven games, Sanchez would only have done so if he was sure he could keep them up. Of his record he said: \"I managed against Alan Pardew, Paul Jewell, Iain Dowie and David Moyes in the lower divisions, and they've all gone on to figure in the Premiership. When I think of the times I've faced these guys in the lower leagues and beaten them, it reinforces my belief.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
