The action will be one of the most significant of Obama\u2019s second term in office and is likely to combine increased resources for border security with work permits for millions of Latino migrants who are currently in the country illegally. Obama decided to act unilaterally after congressional efforts to pass major immigration legislation stalled in the face of Republican opposition. The president announced the address in a video posted to Facebook on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cEverybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\u201d Obama said in the video. \u201cUnfortunately Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long. And so what I\u2019m going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\u201d The televised address was to be broadcast at 8pm on Thursday. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Wednesday that Obama\u2019s proposed steps would bolster border security and improve the economy. \u201cThey will do something to address a lingering problem, which is [to say that] millions of people who currently live in this country can come out of the shadows, they can get right with the law, they can pay their taxes, they can go to the back of the line, but also become fully contributing members of communities large and small across the country,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThis is an important step that will have a pretty profound impact on the lives of millions of people who live here.\u201d Obama was to host 18 Democrats from the House and Senate at the White House on Wednesday night to discuss the steps. On Friday, the morning after his address to the nation, he will travel to a high school in Las Vegas to sign the presidential orders into action. Las Vegas is a symbolic place for the president to talk about immigration. Del Sol high school was also the location the White House selected for a major speech Obama gave in January 2013 urging comprehensive immigration reform. Nevada is also the state with the largest share of undocumented residents \u2013 7.6%, according to research by Pew, compared with 6.3% in both California and Texas. Undocumented migrants comprise 10.2% of Nevada\u2019s labour population, the only state in the country where their share of the working population reaches double digits. And Nevada is the home state of the outgoing Democratic Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, who in recent days has been urging Obama to do everything within his power to improve the immigration system. \u201cI think when the president decides to do his executive order, he should go big,\u201d Reid told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cAs big as he can.\u201d Five months after Obama made the speech at Del Sol high school, the Senate, under Reid\u2019s stewardship, passed a bipartisan bill that would have bolstered border security and provided a path to citizenship for many of the 11 million people living in the country illegally. However, the legislation languished in the Republican-controlled House, prompting Obama to explore ways in which he could bypass Congress to implement a scaled-down version of changes to the immigration system. The exact details of Obama\u2019s executive action, which was postponed until after the recent midterm elections, remain unknown. But immigration experts believe it is likely to include an expansion of earlier action Obama took when he ordered immigration authorities to suspend deportations of young people brought to the country illegally. That action, the 2012 deferred action against childhood arrivals (Daca) order, could be broadened to increase the number of young undocumented migrants who qualify. Obama may also order immigration authorities to suspend deportations of parents of US citizens and legal residents, a measure that could benefit some 3.3 million migrants living in the country illegally. In total, experts calculate Obama\u2019s announcement could affect as many 5 million undocumented migrants. The president\u2019s Republican opponents argue the proposed changes to the immigration system would constitute an \u201camnesty\u201d and claim he would be exceeding his powers. Obama\u2019s conservative critics are calling on Congress to block any execution action, by removing funding to carry them out or by opposing presidential nominees en masse in protest. \u201cIf \u2018Emperor Obama\u2019 ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue \u2013 and many others,\u201d Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said in an email to reporters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
