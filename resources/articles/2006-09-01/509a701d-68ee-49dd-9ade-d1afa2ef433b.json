Whereas other candidates rely solely on the power of their CV, the caretaker can deliver an even more persuasive argument: cold, hard results, and a glowing reference from thousands of fans. Glenn Roeder and Stuart Pearce are among those who have been given significant positions in recent times purely on that basis, and John Carver is in a decent position to join their number after presiding over a rousing victory against second-placed Birmingham on Saturday. At Leeds they rarely find managers any other way - David O'Leary and Peter Reid also started as caretakers before being given the top job - yet there are inherent risks in such a recruitment policy. If it is one of football's truisms that there is an inevitable upturn in results after a manager is sacked, then in the medium-term they are often exposed as being the wrong choice. Relationships are always at their best in the first few weeks; it does not mean they'll go the distance. But the clamour for Carver is rising. That said, the Carver way certainly enabled Leeds to play with rare freedom against Birmingham. It was all the more striking for what had gone before; after the grim reality of the Kevin Blackwell era this was fantasy football. Carver simply could not have asked for more. \"We got 10 out of 10,\" he beamed. \"Result, performance, everything.\" Leeds had scored only once in their previous six league games but they were a constant threat in a thrillingly ramshackle contest. The entertainer-in-chief was David Healy, who slashed a glorious first goal in the sixth minute and then restored Leeds' advantage from the spot moments after Tony Warner's slapstick own-goal. \"After the game someone said to me, 'You might get arrested for entertaining', and they were right,\" said Carver. \"I've come from a culture of entertaining football with Kevin Keegan and Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle and that's how I intend to play.\" Footballing philosophy is not all he shares with Keegan and Robson: Carver's infectious, bumbling geniality has already won over the Leeds fans. And the players. \"If you've got good players, who can get it down and play, you let them get on with it,\" he said. \"That's what I've done.\" Where Blackwell preached pragmatism and switched to 4-5-1 at every opportunity, Carver empowers. \"It will help that John Carver has stated that we will be playing 4-4-2 every game,\" said the chairman, Ken Bates. At the moment, by contrast, Birmingham are playing 4-4-1 every game. The sending off of Damien Johnson, for a preposterous flying elbow on Ian Westlake, was their third red card in as many league games and their fourth this season. \"I'm totally frustrated because I've never, ever had a problem like this before,\" said the manager, Steve Bruce. \"We were the better team with 10 players; with 11, I'm sure we'd have won.\" Of equal concern is Birmingham's weedy defending. \"We have a real goal threat, but we have to get settled defensively,\" Bruce said. Their haplessness at the back was exemplified when Olivier T\u00e9bily headed the winning goal into his own net, and in midfield they were comprehensively outmuscled by the excellent pairing of Shaun Derry and Kevin Nicholls. Bruce's side overflows with attacking fizz - Nicklas Bendtner scored a regal solo goal to make it 2-2 - but he needs to stir the contents more evenly throughout the team. The silver spoon of the chairman, David Gold, has been taken away, however, so Bruce must make do with what he has. For Carver, preserving the status quo will do just nicely.
