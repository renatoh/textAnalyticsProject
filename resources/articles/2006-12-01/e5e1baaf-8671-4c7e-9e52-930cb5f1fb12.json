While Reading are still waiting for theirs from the Chelsea manager (and its remedial effects), Everton doubled their Premiership away win tally to two as Andy Johnson broke his scoring hoodoo, having gone 12 games without a goal . Buoyed by their performance against Chelsea last weekend, Everton convinced as Reading faltered. The visitors were missing Victor Anichebe and Alan Stubbs, last-minute changes to the line-up because of illness and injury respectively. But, confidence unfazed, Johnson made up for their absence with an early chance, saved by the feet of Marcus Hahnemann. After 14 minutes Mikel Arteta followed an excellent run with a pinpoint cross to Johnson waiting in the area. It took the striker a moment to think a way through the blue-and-white socks in there before he scooped up the ball, shot and scored. Everton pressed on, Simon Davies putting in a nonchalant backheel on goal and Leon Osman hitting a thunderous 25-yard shot that rebounded downwards off the crossbar. On the cusp of half time Gary Naysmith felled Seol Hi-Kyeon, provoking a roar from the home crowd. Reading's penalty appeal tested referee Steve Tanner, making his Premiership debut, but he waved play on. Television replays showed the contact to have been made outside the area. The visitors began the second half with a second goal, this time from 23-year-old James McFadden. But it was AJ who put in the legwork, a masterful run down the right, looping the ball over a defender along the way and sending in a cross for McFadden in the box. With the defence missing, he had little to do. 'Our defence has taken a lot of praise in the past,' said Steve Coppell, 'but today they were not at their usual standard.' Everton purred and the home side found them difficult to break down. Cue substitute Leroy Lita after the second goal. The striker did make a difference, setting up James Harper, who should have converted but shot wildly over the bar, followed by a flurry of Reading attempts on goal. But Everton held out. 'We needed a result today,' said David Moyes, 'and AJ was the catalyst for it. Having gone a few games without goals, it was just a case of when.' Reading have taken one point from their past four games. A trip to Chelsea on Boxing Day followed by Manchester United away look even tougher now. Man of the match: Andy Johnson Scored the first and set up the second; how much convincing do you need? The England striker took a hard knock to the head early on from Ibrahima Sonko but shook it off to put in an excellent performance. Johnson was the major difference between the teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
