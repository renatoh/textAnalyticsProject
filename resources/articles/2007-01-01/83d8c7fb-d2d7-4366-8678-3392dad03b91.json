He is, after all, the UK's leading expert on the slave trade, and 2007 marks the 200th anniversary of the act that banned the British from transporting slaves from Africa to the West Indies. Just as well, then, that he looks remarkably fit and chipper for one who has just celebrated his 61st birthday. During a brief break in Hull, between a working holiday in France and a trip to the Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, he pauses to reflect on a life's work that has produced six books, innumerable articles and countless contributions to conferences around the globe. So is there much more to be said on the issue of slavery? \"Oh yes,\" he says. \"We've mined sources in many languages from all over the Atlantic - government papers, newspapers, Lloyd's lists, the private papers of individual traders - but I've no doubt that there's still plenty of digging to be done.\" Deep sorrow He is less certain about the value of apologies by politicians and cities that benefited economically from the trade carried out under the British flag centuries ago. \"I think Ken Livingstone has apologised on behalf of the city of London, and Liverpool city council has done much the same,\" he says. \"And there's still a big debate going on in Bristol.\" Not to mention an expression of \"deep sorrow\" from Tony Blair. \"Apologies are fine, but I'm not sure how far they take you. What I think is important is that you create opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to study history in multicultural centres.\" He confesses himself more impressed by the suggestion from Blair's next-door neighbour and heir apparent, Gordon Brown, that the bicentenary should be marked by a campaign for universal free education in developing countries. \"Africa, in particular, needs brains as well as muscle,\" Richardson says. \"As things stand, its brightest scholarship youngsters are being lured away by the material benefits of the west.\" In other words, far more home-grown scholars are needed to address the critical problems the continent faces. Wise is helping to organise a conference in Ghana later this year to debate the issues of slavery at a time when that country also marks its 50th anniversary. \"We could just allow a lot of western academics to drop in and occupy a pleasant enclave,\" Richardson says. \"But we want people from all over Africa to attend, and this university [Hull] is one of the bodies committed to helping them with their travelling costs. It's a way of trying to give something back.\" Ghana, he points out, is one of the countries to have acknowledged that a minority of Africans played a part in the slave trade, by rounding up the human cargo on behalf of white Europeans and Americans. Its president, John Agyekum Kufuor, came to Hull last year when Wise opened its headquarters in a handsome Victorian building right next door to the home of William Wilberforce. Two years previously, Cherie Blair made a visit to Hull University and, after consultation with the vice-chancellor, hosted a reception for Wise at Downing Street. \"She's a human rights lawyer and very knowledgeable on the issue of slavery,\" Richardson points out. And was her husband there? \"No. He had a prior engagement.\" So, too, did William Hague, the former Conservative leader, who is writing a book on Wilberforce, a fellow Yorkshireman and Tory. Wall of honour In the summer of 2005, when refurbishment was still under way, Wise's patron, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, paid a visit and proclaimed: \"Wilberforce, quite rightly, has a prominent place in your community and your celebration of the emancipation and ending of slavery. He demonstrates how one person can make such a huge difference.\" The names of others who made a difference in struggles for basic human freedoms are inscribed on a handsome, curved wall at the side of the building. Among them are Tutu himself, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Tom Paine, Sylvia Pankhurst and Nelson Mandela. Richardson is just as keen that I take note of a rather less well-known name. It's inscribed across the front of a baseball cap that he produces. Venture Smith (1720-1805) was taken from Africa's Gold Coast to become a slave in Connecticut. Eventually, he bought his freedom and much else. \"He bought and sold land, set himself up in a fine house and established a dynasty,\" Richardson says. \"He was illiterate, but he dictated a narrative about his life, which we're investigating with the University of Connecticut. We've excavated his grave and we're hoping to talk to surviving members of his family. This is another side of the emancipation story - the people who freed themselves and had the determination to make something of their lives.\" But why the baseball cap? \"Well, it's America, isn't it?\" He ought to be well aware of American ways, having been a frequent crosser of the Atlantic. Professor David Eltis, his colleague and co-editor, is now based in Atlanta. Together they have produced an atlas of slavery, aimed at the secondary school market, and an ever-expanding electronic database, logging no fewer than 35,000 journeys by slave traders between the 16th and 19th centuries. It is soon to be put online with the help of a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities in the United States. Meanwhile, Richardson is primed to give a series of lectures on the growth and ending of the British slave trade, dedicated to Pulitzer prize-winning Professor David Brion Davis, the octogenarian academic Richardson calls the \"daddy of them all\" in his field. The venue will be Yale University. Richardson is also a regular visitor to Harvard. Its DuBois Institute is named after the founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People - one of the names on the Wise wall. Yale and Harvard are grand settings indeed for a British lad from a terraced street who once turned down the chance to apply for Oxford or Cambridge. Richardson was born in Runcorn on Merseyside, the son of working-class parents (still alive and kicking in their 90s). Having been bussed to a grammar school in a nearby town, he was the first member of the family to go to university. Liverpool was just up the road and might have been a useful base, bearing in mind his later speciality. But when he left school in 1964, the city's notoriety as a centre for the slave trade had long since been overtaken by its fame as the birthplace of the Beatles. Seeds of interest On the advice of an inspirational history teacher, he went to Manchester instead, to study history, politics and economics. \"In my third year, I had to write a dissertation on the colonial economies of the southern states, such as Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia,\" he recalls. \"It struck me that there was a minority white population and a large black population, surrounded by a native Indian population.\" The seeds of his future interests were sewn at that point, watered by the turbulent struggle for civil rights that was rising higher and higher up the news agenda as the 60s progressed. In 1969, he moved to Hull and began his steady progression from assistant lecturer in economics to professor of economic history. \"Through the 70s and 80s,\" he explains, \"Wilberforce's presence as a Hull figure gradually began to impinge on my work.\" All the more so in 1983, when he wrote a series of essays to mark the 150th anniversary of Wilberforce's death and, shortly afterwards, the passage through parliament of the act that finally abolished slavery throughout the British empire. Or did it? We may not have an empire any longer, but it would be difficult to argue that we no longer have a trade in human beings. In the reception area at Wise is a poster that poses the question: \"People for sale in Canada? The answer will shock you.\" Beneath it is the irrefutable comment: \"Human trafficking is a serious crime.\" And not just in Canada. Perhaps the still-thriving business of transporting women from eastern Europe to work in the brothels and massage parlours of the UK explains why one of the bicentenary conferences Richardson is planning in Hull this year will be called simply, Slavery: Unfinished Business.
