No sooner had he outlined his romantic difficulties, in an interview in New Zealand, than the toothfish edged him off social media, having emerged, with the publication of the Charles letters, as high on the royal agenda, for albatross-related reasons. Albatrosses are a theme, like sheep, to which the Prince of Wales frequently returns, and not just in letters. As with his fellow albatross fan, the ancient mariner, whose manner he increasingly seems to replicate \u2013 \u201cHold off! unhand me grey-beard loon!\u201d \u2013 the prince is cursed to repeat and repeat his warnings, subjecting selected ministers to baleful, tortured letters, whose primary import, now that we see them, is surely psychological. He just can\u2019t stop himself. \u201cThat moment that his face I see,/ I know the man that must hear me:/ To him my tale I teach.\u201d Leave aside the needless suffering to politicians, the constitutional implications and this furious corresponding speaks of a still consuming dissatisfaction in a man of advancing years, unalleviated by family, great wealth, the best efforts of his sycophants and vegetables. It must be a dismal spectacle for his son, William, who faces much the same fate, minus albatrosses, and perhaps also for his daughter-in-law, whose first child, George, is destined to follow a similar path: a good, seven-decade wait, followed by a spot of elderly ruling, probably with a tailgating heir at his back. The toddler\u2019s wave to crowds, prior to his baby sister\u2019s formal presentation, suggests that some schooling in regal conduct has already begun; at any rate, the public approved his bewildered participation in the show as they might not have applauded, say, a toddler in a child pageant, propelled by an ambitious mother. Much recent commentary on the greater freedom enjoyed by a second-in-line, such as the late drunkard, Princess Margaret, is contradicted by Prince Harry\u2019s melancholy asides about seeking a wife and family. \u201cYou ain\u2019t ever going to find someone who\u2019s going to jump into the position that it would hold,\u201d he has said. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d He might want to warn Princess Charlotte. Assuming, that is, her parents are not opponents of royalification. Beyond Kensington Palace, there is growing resistance to social conditioning that limits the potential of little girls and boys, for instance with gendered games, costumes and books. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious matter,\u201d said the children\u2019s writer, Anne Fine, \u201cbecause it does narrow children\u2019s sense of what they\u2019re allowed to do or like in a horrible, horrible way.\u201d Still, the royalist majority appears complacent about the traditional narrowing \u2013 in the monarchy\u2019s version of Billy Elliot, or perhaps Here Comes Honey Boo Boo \u2013 of royal children\u2019s options to, effectively, one. As for republicans, perhaps it seems ludicrous to sympathise with infants born to the palace-dwellers we keep in butlers, nannies, organic ink. But even supposing Princess Charlotte escapes, as Prince George will not, the public pressure quickly to pair and breed, her future is similarly designed by her family (who know what is being sacrificed) to deny her privacy, her choices, her solitude, the opportunity to become her own person, any meaningful career, the time and space to find a partner: virtually everything, in fact, you might want for a child. Including not being a lifetime tabloid and terrorist target. And not having her social and sexual development scrutinised by round-the-clock police officers. In fact, if any other parents plan to emulate this approach to child-rearing they might be wise not to share this with child protection professionals. In the case of Prince Harry, a freakish level of parental control continued at least into his late 20s, after he\u2019d flown helicopters round a war zone. His father, he disclosed, after his embarrassment in Las Vegas, was \u201calways trying to remind me about who I am and stuff like that\u201d. Without, for a second, drawing any parallel between baby George\u2019s nursery and the world of, say, David Berg\u2019s Children of God cult, some reports from the latter\u2019s adult escapees help clarify the kinds of deprivation a prominent royal Briton learns to live with. Taylor Stevens has described how it felt to exit. \u201cI woke up,\u201d she says, \u201cfinally free of the eyes that had been watching and judging me my entire life. Going to the shops, booking a doctor\u2019s appointment \u2013 all the ordinary things most adults take for granted \u2013 were so novel for me. Walking down the street alone felt extraordinary \u2013 we had always gone out in pairs. It was like being naked.\u201d Richard Dawkins, of course, has called the unquestioning inculcation of religion a form of child abuse. We can\u2019t be sure that royal children are so expertly indoctrinated, like the female products of an efficiently run religious patriarchy, that they come to regard their criminally limited futures as natural and correct. Maybe the alternatives come to look too scary. Either way, ever since Edward VIII proved himself unequal to expectations, royal issue has shown itself notably submissive, to the point of joining the armed forces when required, falling in love with Africa as and when, hunting and polo playing to order. Only Prince Edward\u2019s exit from the Marines and tentative TV career interrupted normal service. That both episodes occasioned public jeering and, it was reported, paternal disapproval perhaps deterred future disobedience. Then again, there is often no missing the lack of enthusiasm for public appearances that constitute, once royals have left the services, pretty much all their job. Sullenness, whining, jibes \u2013 not to say physical attacks, in the case of Prince Charles\u2019s press secretary leaping at Michael Crick, or Prince Harry \u201cplayfully\u201d slapping purple paint on a photographer \u2013 betray levels of professional discontent that would, in any other line of work, indicate a change of career. Diana\u2019s sons, in particular, have made clear their disgust for press interest, on which, however, both their family\u2019s reputation, and its fortunes, depend. While the palace requests seclusion for William and Kate\u2019s new baby, Charles\u2019s shop at Highgrove launches a commemorative range of bone china, \u201cspecially commissioned by Royal Collection Trust to celebrate the birth of HRH Princess Charlotte of Cambridge\u201d and featuring the combined coats of arms of the Middletons and Cambridges. If the Royal Collection Trust has not already commissioned a Patagonian toothfish pillbox to celebrate the publication of the black spider letters, Charles might want to send his loyal press secretary, Kristina Kyriacou, to knock out the teeth of whoever is responsible. Merely because royal princes are willing to press even their newborns into service, pending apprenticeship at an age when they are too young to object, hardly seems to excuse public collaboration in the exercise. The royals, at least, have been brainwashed into thinking that self-determination is optional. It\u2019s too late to liberate Charles, William, Harry from this cult of polo-playing albatross worshippers. George is another matter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
