The A-League begins its 10th season on Friday night and with the organisation having made many more steps forward than back in its nine seasons to date you can forgive the giddiness of the FFA\u2019s Frank Lowy and David Gallop in the lead-up. \u201cThere is no more beautiful game than our game,\u201d Lowy enthused at the season launch on Wednesday, and he predicted the A-league doubling, if not tripling, its viewers, spectators and (though this will be harder to measure) the quality of football in the next 10 years. Then, like a man trying to catch smoke in his bare hands, Gallop bravely attempted to describe the beauty and he likened the A-League to \u2026 a summer\u2019s day? A rose? Les Murray\u2019s eyes after a storm? Not even close. No, he likened it to a hamburger with the lot. Supporters of the old NSL may see this as a deliberate attempt to further distance the A-League from Australian football\u2019s rich history of souvlaki, pastizzi, gozleme, pizza and what not, but there you go. Let\u2019s just hope that the hamburger we get this season looks as good as the one in the picture. Will Berisha give the Wanderers the blues? You\u2019d think Western Sydney\u2019s heroics in the Asian Champions League has given them a head start over their Friday night opponents, Melbourne Victory. Having made their way through to the ACL final Tony Popovic\u2019s side are already into their stride at a time of year when hesitant steps are to be expected, and already the Wanderers\u2019 defence is finding the steel of previous seasons. But Popovic\u2019s squad will play Victory without stalwarts Matthew Spiranovic, Nikolai Topor-Stanley and Tomi Juric and that, in itself, gives Victory a look in. But that\u2019s not the Victory\u2019s only hope. Kevin Muscat\u2019s side have also enjoyed a pleasing pre-season and, besides having the home ground advantage in the opening round, they look a more capable outfit than last season when they struggled for consistency \u2013 though they were consistent in efficiently fishing the ball out of their own net: only Wellington conceded more goals. The exciting arrival of Besart Berisha won\u2019t do much to help Victory\u2019s defence (that\u2019s what Carl Valeri and Frenchman Matthieu Delpierre are for), but it will give the Victory an out-and-out front man and he and Gui Finkler could make some beautiful music together this season. All eyes will be on Berisha on Friday night, including those of the Wanderers who\u2019ve been stung by the Albanian before. Despite some big name absentees (including Mark Milligan) it\u2019s a mouth-watering, season-opening tie. The sky blue derby Much has been said about Melbourne Heart\u2019s reinvention as Melbourne City, but Sydney FC have undergone a change of their own in the off-season. While it hasn\u2019t involved anything quite so radical as a name and kit change brought on by new foreign owners with access to enormous oil reserves and guest players of the calibre of David Villa (who\u2019s in the City squad for Saturday night), Sydney\u2019s transformation has been structurally and, perhaps even culturally, significant. With Frank Farina moved on, and Alessandro del Piero now dodging traffic in Delhi, Sydney will start afresh with Graham Arnold on the sidelines and, on the pitch, a cadre of new recruits. Sydney rarely seemed to have a plan last season, much less a philosophy, so their fans will be hoping to see evidence of both \u2013 with a good side order of attacking football. Served by the likes of Bernie Ibini, Alex Brosque, Shane Smeltz, Austrian marquee, Marc Janko, and in-form incumbent Corey Gameiro, this should be forthcoming. City, meantime, will be hungry to distance themselves from the team that secured last season\u2019s wooden spoon. The City revolution could take time, but the likes of Damien Duff, Robert Koren, Erik Paartalu and, yes, that man Villa (Will he get some game time this week? Should he double up on shin pads?) aren\u2019t here to make up the numbers. Football should be the winner What do you do when you fall off an Albanian? You get right back on again, and that\u2019s what the Brisbane Roar have done in replacing Berisha with the incoming Mensur Kurtishi. Understandably Kurtishi is wearying of comparisons to his countryman but, then again, by the end of the season if it\u2019s still happening he, and Brisbane, will be delighted (unless, of course, they\u2019re talking about hotheadedness rather than goals). Sunday will give most of us our first opportunity to see him in action, and to see whether the stable look of the champions on paper is reflected on the pitch. After so much recent success can they maintain the necessary drive to do it all again? Josep Gombau\u2019s Adelaide side should be driven, and be among the challengers this year. After a slow but measured start last year Adelaide were soon playing attractive, possession-based football, but whenever we got excited Gombau would remind us that they were a work in progress. He may be more bullish about their chances this year should they start off where they left off last season, as one of the form teams. Like Brisbane, Adelaide have a fairly stable line-up, and so should be better prepared than most to hit the ground running. Who\u2019ll take an early step to dispel the naysayers? Two games this weekend \u2013 Central Coast v Newcastle and Wellington v Perth \u2013 involve four teams from whom relatively little to nothing much is expected this season, apart from turning up every week in a clean strip and fighting among themselves for places seventh to 10th on the ladder. The Central Coast, of course, laugh in the face of doom-mongers, then defy them on the pitch. But after four years in the top three, and with little movement in the transfer market in the off-season, the Mariners, especially if they continue to struggle in front of goal (c\u2019mon Mitchell Duke, it\u2019s time), could be due a slump. Their opponents on Saturday, Newcastle, are fighting to get out of a slump and they\u2019ll play the derby hoping that their new signing, Marcos Flores \u2013 who\u2019s carrying a grudge against the Mariners for letting him go on account of his serious knee injury \u2013 lives up to his tough talking and his promise to be successful at the Jets. Over in Wellington, meantime, where Ernie Merrick is rebuilding the Phoenix (Carlos Hernandez and Paul Ifil out, Nathan Burns and Michael McGlinchey in) Kenny Lowe\u2019s Perth will be looking to improve on their terrible record in New Zealand where they\u2019ve won just one match of 12. But with some promising new signings, like Mitch Nichols and Youssouf Hersi, perhaps this is the year.
