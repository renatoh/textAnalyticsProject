Only marginally smaller in fact than the disappointment that followed. A forgettable White Hart Lane career was eventually extinguished by Glenn Hoddle, and ended in enforced Turkish exile with Fenerbahce. Four years on, Rebrov's second coming - as a West Ham player - has been a more low-key affair, but the 30-year-old is determined to make up for lost time and ensure maximum gain from his capital return. West Ham, who open their season at Leicester tomorrow, were not the Ukrainian's only suitors, with Norwich City also interested, but Rebrov says he is certain he made the right decision. \"I felt it was better to sign for a club in the First Division which is upwardly mobile and in with a chance of winning every game, rather than for a Premier League club struggling for survival which might just win a few games in the season,\" he said. \"We'll be battling to win this league. I'm used to competing for league titles from my Dynamo Kiev days. It didn't quite happen at Spurs. But it will be the case again this season. \"I've joined a very professional outfit, with strong ambitions to return to the Premiership. This is one of England's top clubs and they belong in the top flight. Everything that I've seen here so far suggests we can do that this season. \"There are a lot of talented young players and there's plenty of experience - a great mix and a great atmosphere. It was really good to get a positive reaction from the fans on Saturday [in his debut against Anderlecht] and I'll be doing all I can to justify their trust.\" Rebrov is equally keen to repay the faith shown in him by the Upton Park manager Alan Pardew, who has handed him a four-year deal. Since his days under the late Valery Lobanovsky, his mentor at Dynamo Kiev and the man who nurtured his once devastating partnership with Andrei Shevchenko, Rebrov has lacked a coach who has truly believed in him. His move to Tottenham in 2000 was the work of the then technical director David Pleat and the Dynamo president Igor Surkis, and there was always the sense that George Graham was reluctant to embrace him. Under Graham's successor Hoddle, a manager who might have been expected to appreciate his subtle talents, he found himself the victim of the big freeze. \"It's a normal situation that a new coach comes and brings in his own players, or players that he likes,\" he said. \"The only thing that really upset me was that Hoddle could have told me in the first month that I didn't figure in his plans. I think I deserved a bit of frankness. Instead I ended up sitting on the bench for over half a year, with my chances of moving on diminishing all the time.\" In Turkey it was \"the same situation all over again\" when, weeks after his arrival at Fenerbahce, their new coach Christoph Daum was appointed and decided to bring his own foreign players. Rebrov became the sixth foreigner at the club, with a league quota of five per team. He is convinced that in Pardew he has finally found a coach who will make him feel wanted and enable him to resume centre stage. \"It was very important for me to see that the coach genuinely wanted me in his team. As soon as I realised this was the case I told him that agreeing financial terms would not be a problem. In the last few years, unfortunately, I've played under trainers who didn't really want to see me in their teams. As soon as Pardew explained his plans for me, I knew this was the right club.\" One of Hoddle's first acts as Tottenham manager was to sign Teddy Sheringham and he swiftly decreed that there could be no room for him and Rebrov in the same team, a view which has always bemused the Ukrainian. Ironically, the two forwards are now reunited in east Lon don, and early indications suggest that Hoddle's logic was flawed. For 70 minutes of Saturday's friendly the two co-habited happily, combining well on numerous occasions. It was a sumptuously weighted pass by Rebrov down the right which started the move for a Sheringham header which gave West Ham a 3-2 lead. Although Rebrov still prefers to play as a support striker, in Turkey he was largely deployed on the right of midfield and says he is happy to continue there if required. Pardew appreciates that versatility. \"Against Anderlecht I played on the right, on the left and then up front. Basically, I'm happy to play wherever the coach wants me, as long as I'm playing. I think I showed that I can do a job in midfield when I was in Turkey. I don't measure my success by the number of goals I score but by the value of my contribution to the team. \"It's great to be back in London. Going to Turkey was positive in some ways. Fenerbahce won the championship. I was pleased with that. I didn't play as much as I would have liked but I know I played my part. Having said all this, England is home - this is where my family feel settled.\" Any bitterness over his treatment at Tottenham has gone. He refuses to get drawn into a slanging match, but there is clearly nothing he would like more than a trip to White Hart Lane next season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
