(Mother, Kate, was absent, incapacitated by morning sickness.) Some people might now hope that this marks the close of a particularly intense period of royal watching \u2013 the period of Diana remembrance frenzy. For a while, at least, a halt might be called to the anguished guff about people\u2019s princesses, princesses of hearts and the like. At least \u2013 this time around \u2013 it was the actual anniversary of her death. Too often, no excuse seems necessary for the cyclical torrents of (extremely repetitive) information about Diana. Personally, it can feel akin to being forced by a crazed, bayonet-wielding Beefeater into retuning into a decades-old royal soap opera. Watching William being a good, hands-on father reminded me of a persistent odd quirk in royal coverage. Every time William or Harry displays any sign of humanity or good manners, it\u2019s boomed that they\u2019re \u201ca credit to their mother\u201d. And, of course, they are, but why does Charles never get a mention? He parented them, too, and alone (with Camilla) for all the years after the tragedy, but it\u2019s generally Diana who gets all the credit. Perhaps it\u2019s this kind of mawkishly militant beatification of Diana that makes the whole spectacle so wearisome. In a way, George\u2019s first day at school showcased the new generation, perhaps even the next phase, of British royalty, a bit like a Star Wars or Avengers franchise renewal, but without the Christmas tie-in merchandise opportunities. Leaving aside the vexed matter of whether it was a good idea for the nation to gawp at a small, vulnerable child\u2019s first day at school \u2013 thankfully, only one photographer was allowed to be present \u2013 it was quite interesting to watch William in action. On one level, just another dad (a nice caring dad) seeing his kid off to his first day of school. On another, it\u2019s the latest instalment of what\u2019s fast becoming \u201cThe Wills and Kate Windsor Middle-Class Real-Time Panto\u201d. While this was Kate\u2019s actual background, she somehow joins William in appearing as though they\u2019re actively engaged in an over-zealous tutorial, or well-received TED talk, on \u201cbeing uber-middle class\u201d. Indeed, the future monarch and his queen appear to be meta-normalising or, if you prefer, \u201cde-royalising\u201d at such an incredible rate, I keep half-expecting to bump into Kate going through the sales rail in Seasalt or to spot William in Caff\u00e8 Nero and asking if he could keep an eye on my cappuccino while I nip to the loo. While William\u2019s yearning for Middleton-level normality has long been noted, the elephant stubbornly refuses to budge from the room \u2013 in that (deep breath)\u2026 William and Kate are not middle class! Not even a posh version. The last time I checked, middle-class people didn\u2019t tend to be feudal heirs to the British throne or have their child\u2019s first day at school broadcast all over the world. The fact that William and Kate want to be middle class, or at least present as such, could say something very positive \u2013 demonstrating that they want the royal family to remain relatable to the British public in a more metropolitan way than ever before. More cynically, this couple triggering all the right middle-class endorphins (\u201cThe Veg-Box Factor\u201d?) could help ensure the royal family\u2019s survival in these serious troubled times. Whatever lies behind it all, nothing quite takes away the strangeness of watching these high-ranking royals conduct an ongoing, near-flawless impersonation of affluent, middle-class life, almost as though an evil wizard has trapped them inside an affluent London snow globe. Whether you find this bizarre, sweet or sad (or annoying), for me, it makes the royal family more interesting than they\u2019ve ever been before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
