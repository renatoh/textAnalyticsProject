The controversial mining group, which is responsible for the Carmichael coalmine in central Queensland, announced on Thursday it would change the name of its Australian operation to \u201cBravus\u201d, a word identified by chief executive David Boshoff as the medieval Latin word for \u201ccourageous\u201d. Boshoff told the Australian Financial Review it was a good fit because the company \u201ctook a lot of courage to get where we are and we will stand up for what we believe in\u201d. However, multiple Latin experts have pointed out that \u201cbravus\u201d does not mean \u201cbrave\u201d and is more accurately translated as \u201ccrooked\u201d or \u201cmercenary\u201d. Dr Christopher Bishop, from the Australian National University\u2019s centre of classical studies, said \u201cbravus\u201d did not mean \u201cbrave\u201d in either classical or medieval Latin. \u201cThey are wrong,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt would have to be something like \u2018fortis\u2019, for brave, if you are going for your classical. You know, something like \u2018fortuna favet fortibus \u2013 fortune favours the brave\u2019. That\u2019s a schoolboy thing \u2013 everyone knows that.\u201d Dr Juanita Feros Ruys from the University of Sydney agreed. \u201cThe most common Latin term for the concept of \u2018brave\u2019 would be \u2018fortis\u2019 (from where we derive \u2018fortify\u2019, \u2018fortitude\u2019) and that would appear to be the case for both classical and medieval Latin, for each of which there are many examples,\u201d she said. Bishop said medieval Latin was often difficult to translate, but most translations of \u201cbravus\u201d would, unfortunately for Adani, have negative connotations. \u201cIt is sort of a Monty Python-Latin,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is that classic joke where you chuck an \u2018-us\u2019 on to the end of anything and call it Latin.\u201d Bishop said the closest relative to \u201cbravus\u201d was the medieval Latin word \u201cbravo\u201d \u2013 a noun meaning a \u201cmercenary\u201d, \u201cassassin\u201d or \u201csword for hire\u201d. \u201cAs far as I know, it [bravus] is an unattested medieval word,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have \u2018bravo\u2019 \u2013 meaning a mercenary, a sword for hire, a tough guy. Which is probably not what they want to associate with. The closest Adani could get is it could have meant \u2018boldness\u2019. But it is a pretty militant boldness.\u201d Prof Tim Parkin from the University of Melbourne said he found an entry for \u201cbravus\u201d in a dictionary of medieval Latin. \u201cIt tends to be used of someone who is villainous,\u201d he said. \u201cA crook, or a bandit, or a cut-throat.\u201d According to an article from the Oxford University Press, \u201cbravus\u201d could be derived from either the classical Latin word \u201cpravus\u201d \u2013 meaning crooked, bad or depraved \u2013 or the classical Latin word \u201cbarbarus\u201d \u2013 meaning barbaric, foreign or uncouth. Bishop said: \u201cEven if it is not \u2018barbarus\u2019, it could be a mispronunciation of \u2018pravus\u2019. Ps, Bs and Fs always get mixed up \u2013 it could literally be \u2018pravus\u2019, which means \u2018bad, crooked, depraved\u2019. Maybe it is \u2018barbarus\u2019 plus \u2018pravus\u2019 \u2013 meaning a depraved barbarian.\u201d Initially named after its founder, the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, the Adani Group launched the Carmichael coal mine project in 2014. A spokeswoman for Adani/Bravus said the new name was \u201cderived from the words \u2018brave\u2019 or \u2018bold\u2019.\u201d \u201cIt includes the \u2018us\u2019 suffix, highlighting the inclusive nature of us the company, us the employees and us the community. It references the fact we are an Australian company by having the letters \u2018AUS\u2019 in the name. It signifies that we are proud to be an Australian company that is part of the North Queensland community.\u201d Speaking to the AFR, Boshoff denied the name was being changed because it was \u201ctoxic\u201d. \u201cIf [we were] motivated by that it would have made sense to change our name 18 months ago or earlier,\u201d he said. The Adani name change comes after the company quietly rebranded its Abbot Point coal terminal to the North Queensland Export Terminal earlier this year. In 2015, the operator of the Manus Island and Nauru detention centres, Transfield Services, changed its name to Broadspectrum. In 2009, the US private military company Blackwater changed its name to Xe after its contractors killed civilians in Iraq. More recently, tech company Google rebranded its parent company as Alphabet, WeWork rebranded to The We Company after large losses, and Facebook rebranded to FACEBOOK to \u201cadd a sense of optimism\u201d in November last year. Parkin told Guardian Australia that Adani should have \u201cconsulted a classics department rather than gone to Google translate\u201d. \u201cIt reminds me of one of my brothers wanting a name for his boat, and I came up with some wonderful classics names for it. And, in the end, I think he went for something like \u2018boatus\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
