The last Labour government introduced regulations to make all homes zero carbon by 2016, but the rules were scrapped by David Cameron less than a year before they were due to come into force. Now, Labour says it would create a new \u201czero-carbon standard\u201d to ensure new homes make no positive contribution to greenhouse emissions. The standard would be introduced by 2022. The party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, says tackling the climate emergency is at the heart of the \u201creal change\u201d he promised when he launched Labour\u2019s campaign for the general election on Thursday. \u201cHomes should be safe and warm for families and not damage the environment for future generations,\u201d he will say in a speech on Saturday. \u201cBut our housing currently contributes a massive 14% of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cWe will tackle the housing and climate crises at the same time by building warm and energy-efficient homes.\u201d Zero-carbon homes have to be so efficient and well insulated that they can generate as much energy as they use, leading to an expected cut of up to \u00a3200 a year from household energy bills. The regulations would not specify how the target should be achieved \u2013 but it would be likely to result in many more homes being fitted with solar panels, better insulation, and energy-saving alternatives to traditional gas boilers, such as heat pumps. The Goldsmith Street development of council houses in Norwich, which recently won the Stirling architecture prize, minimise their carbon footprint by complying with the ambitious German Passivhaus standard, for example. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said: \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 decision to cave in to property developers and slash green standards means we are building homes today that aren\u2019t fit for the future \u2013 they\u2019re bad for the environment and expensive to run.\u201d Corbyn will spend Saturday touring constituencies in south-west England as the party gears up for a tough six-week election campaign. Tory MP Robert Jenrick, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, said: \u201cLabour are setting unrealistic targets that would slow down housebuilding and put up house prices. \u201cBoris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking a practical, sensible approach to reducing emissions from homes. We are introducing a Future Homes Standard that will be ensure new homes meet reductions in emissions by a third by 2020, and world leading by 2025.\u201d Labour\u2019s homes pledge comes as the government announced the launch of a review into how the UK can meet its target of producing net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The pledge was put in legislation by Theresa May in one of her final acts in Downing Street. The Treasury review will examine how the UK can maximise economic growth, while making the transition to being a green economy. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, said: \u201cThe UK is leading the way on tackling climate change as the first major economy to legislate for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We must all play a part in protecting the planet for future generations. \u201cThis review is a vital next step in delivering that commitment, ensuring that we can end our contribution to global warming, while supporting growth and balancing costs, to avoid placing unfair burdens on families or businesses.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
