The Dolphins had a plan in place that involved starting perennial place-holder Ryan Fitzpatrick, allowing Tagovailoa some time to adjust to the pros. The plan changed last week when the Dolphins decided that now was the time to install the Alabama product as the QB. It was a curious move given how well the Dolphins had played under Fitzpatrick, but one which makes sense when factoring in that Miami has a legitimate reason to think it will be making a return trip to the postseason. If there was one person who was particularly blindsided by Miami\u2019s decision, it was Fitzpatrick, who was in the midst of one of his trademark stretches of tantalizingly great football that he\u2019s capable of conjuring. It was easy to understand why the 37-year-old journeyman was upset, as this was not a situation where the Dolphins necessarily needed to make a change at quarterback. Before today\u2019s games, the spin was that the Dolphins have first- and second-round picks in next year\u2019s draft courtesy of the Houston Texans and want to know what they have with Tagovailoa before they go out and possibly use one of those picks on a signal-caller. So what do they have? Well, that\u2019s still to be determined. Yes, the Dolphins defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a 28-17 score in Tagovailoa\u2019s starting debut, but it was the epitome of a total team effort. In the game, the Dolphins managed to score a touchdown through the air, on the ground, on defense and on special teams. The last time that the Dolphins did all that in a game? That would be 1993, way back during the glory days of grunge. All eyes, obviously, were on the highly touted Tagovailoa, but his numbers won\u2019t dazzle anybody. He went 12-for-22 for 93 yards with a single touchdown. He was credited for two carries, but zero total rushing yards. He did, as they say, enough for his team to win. Or not to lose. This leads us to the other reason that the Dolphins are moving on from Fitzpatrick. While Fitzpatrick is known for playing impressive stretches of football, he is also well-known for regressing to the mean at the worst possible times. That wouldn\u2019t be a problem for Miami if they continued to think of this as a bridge year, but the calculus may have changed in the last few weeks. Sunday\u2019s game between the New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills was billed as a potential \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d contest. Coming off of a three-game losing streak, the Patriots struggled offensively and defensively against the Bills, who are currently the top seed in the AFC East. While the Patriots managed to put themselves in a position to tie or win the game late, it was all undone by a last-minute fumble by quarterback Cam Newton, whose time in New England may have already be coming to an end. With the 24-21 win, the Bills improved their record to 6-2 while the Patriots have sunk to a previously inconceivable 2-5. For the longest time, the AFC East has essentially been the Patriots\u2019 birthright. The last time they failed to win it was in 2008, when Tom Brady suffered a season-ending injury in Week 1 one and they lost a tiebreaker to \u2013 who else? \u2013 the Dolphins. Miami have only made the postseason once since then (a blink-and-you\u2019d-miss-it appearance in 2016), but now, thanks to the Patriots\u2019 struggles and the absolute dumpster fire that is the New York Jets, they have to think that they\u2019ve stumbled upon a golden opportunity to make a return trip. Maybe that\u2019s why they decided to hit fast-forward straight to Tua time. There\u2019s no need to build a bridge to the future when the future could already be here. Video of the week So it\u2019s safe to say that wind was a bit of a factor in the Los Angeles Raiders-Cleveland Browns game. Raiders kicker Daniel Carlson looked like he was going to absolutely nail this field goal. Instead, a burst of wind rejected it like an NBA center. The end result? This weird, wobbly curveball of a kick that inexplicably hit the post. The Raiders still managed to put together a 16-6 victory so this Act of God ended up being a non-factor That wasn\u2019t the only kick affected by the weather. Gusts were also doing wonky things in Green Bay. MVP of the week Let\u2019s go extremely inside the box here. Minnesota Vikings running back Dalvin Cook ended up scoring four touchdowns in the Vikings\u2019 28-22 win over the Packers. He ran in three of them, eventually rushing for a total of 163 yards, and also caught Kirk Cousins\u2019 sole touchdown pass. The memorable hook here: all four TDs happened on Minnesota\u2019s first four offensive possessions. How important is Cook to this team? Without him, the entire Vikings team combined to rush for 32 total yards against the Atlanta Falcons two weeks ago. Quote of the week \u201cYou just can\u2019t count out Nick Foles\u201d \u2013 Fox commentator Troy Aikman, who somehow wasn\u2019t wrong in this particular instance Nobody really trusts Nick Foles. And yet the Chicago Bears quarterback has a way of succeeding when least expected. That\u2019s how you get named as Super Bowl MVP after a season you were supposed to be spending as the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 backup. Aikman here was talking about how Foles helped rally the Bears into a late-game comeback against a New Orleans Saints team that looked to be in full control. During the last minutes of regulation, Foles went 12-for-15, converted two fourth downs and ultimately set up Cairo Santos\u2019s game-tying field goal. (The wind cooperated, this time.) Unfortunately for the Bears, they faltered in overtime, losing 26-23. Stat of the week 8. That\u2019s the number of times Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has scored at least three touchdowns in the first half of an NFL game. This feat should double as a tribute to both Mahomes, obviously, and the entire offense that Kansas City has built around him. (Oh, it\u2019s also a tribute to the New York Jets, who are now 0-8 and halfway to an Imperfect Season.) Elsewhere around the league \u2022 The Russell Wilson MVP Watch continues. In the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 37-27 win over the San Francisco 49ers, he scored four touchdowns on 27-for-37 passing. What\u2019s astounding about Wilson\u2019s numbers is just how we\u2019re used to him doing things like this seemingly every other game. We\u2019ve grown accustomed to his greatness, which is too bad. If he does end up winning MVP, it will be party on merit, but also something of a Lifetime Achievement Award. \u2022 One general rule of thumb is that when the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens get together, you can usually expect a close, physical and dramatic game. Sunday\u2019s was no different. Looking at the wrong side of a 28-24 score with the clock running down, the Ravens put themselves in a position to win the game at the end. In a fourth-down situation, quarterback Lamar Jackson had a shot for a game-winning touchdown. Instead, it was harmlessly flicked away by Minkah Fitzpatrick. Because of this, the undefeated Steelers have improved their record to 7-0. Meanwhile, Baltimore lost both the biannual grudge match and All-Pro left tackle Ronnie Stanley, who is out for the season with an ankle injury. \u2022 There was, however, a successful game-winning touchdown play on Sunday and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, it came against the Chargers. Apparently, neither relocation or moving on from Philip Rivers were sufficient enough moves for the franchise to change their identity as Fourth-Quarter Crumblers. This time around it was Drew Lock who fired the dagger in the game\u2019s closing seconds to make this a 31-30 Denver Broncos victory. \u2022 The typically entertaining Dallas Cowboys-Philadelphia Eagles rivalry game certainly looked like a fantastic matchup on paper before the season, so it made all sense in the world for the NFL to schedule it for a prime time Sunday Night Football broadcast. Unfortunately for them, the Cowboys lost Dak Prescott a few weeks ago and the Eagles have just looked lost. Heading into this matchup, the two teams had combined to win a grand total of four games. Somehow, it was even more dreadful than anticipated with the Eagles winning 23-9 (mostly because someone had to) and taking control of an NFC East which could end up being the worst division in NFL history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
