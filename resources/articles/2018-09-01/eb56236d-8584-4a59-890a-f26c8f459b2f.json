Downing Street hopes the migration policy will appeal to party members concerned about May\u2019s leadership and the Brexit negotiations, which last week appeared to have reached an impasse at Salzburg when EU leaders declared her Chequers proposals would not work. Ministers signed off a plan presented by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, in which skilled workers will more easily be able to obtain visas than the unskilled and in which there will be no preferential access to the UK labour market for EU citizens. Territories which strike a free trade deal with the UK, including the EU, will be given enhanced access to the British labour market, but that in the future could include the United States, Canada, or elsewhere. At the same time, no significant concerns were raised by cabinet members about the status of the divorce talks, even though hard Brexiters on the right of her party continued to press for May to change her policy, publishing their alternative \u201cCanada-style\u201d free trade proposal. The Brexit negotiations update was held at the end of the cabinet meeting on Monday afternoon and the only person who referred to a Canada-style trade deal was the prime minister herself in her own presentation. She added that some EU heads of government were being more constructive than others behind the scenes, but did not specify which leaders. The meeting amounted to a moment of relief for the under-pressure prime minister, who heads to New York on Tuesday for a United Nations meeting before turning her attention to the party conference. One cabinet source said May was \u201cjust trying to get through the conference season intact\u201d. A white paper setting out the new immigration policy is due to be published later this autumn. Last week, the government\u2019s Migration Advisory Committee, a group of independent experts, proposed that the UK implement policy that favoured skilled workers in a paper that paved the way for Javid and May. But its proposal that there should be no visas made available for unskilled workers outside agriculture provoked alarm among business leaders, who said they needed access to a large labour pool to fill jobs in sectors such as construction, haulage and hospitality. However, a Whitehall source said: \u201cWhilst the MAC report said that low-skilled immigration doesn\u2019t really add anything to the economy, Sajid recognises that for certain types of businesses, including hospitality and social care, you do need that labour flow coming in. \u201cSo it\u2019s about necessity and what the economy requires, but with an absolute guarantee of ending freedom of movement and not having the preferential system.\u201d There was a \u201ctiny bit of grumbling\u201d from Philip Hammond about potentially extending freedom of movement beyond the transition period but that was \u201cquickly seen off\u201d, sources said. The chancellor and business secretary Greg Clark both called for more flexibility so businesses could continue to operate. Hammond told colleagues \u201cwe need more than just a trade deal\u201d while Clark said \u201cmobility is to services what customs is to trade\u201d, sources revealed. Both men backed the home secretary\u2019s plan. The welfare secretary, Esther McVey, had what one colleague described as an \u201cindirect pop\u201d at the chancellor. She said: \u201cOn the one hand, we\u2019re told that when we leave the EU we will go into a recession. On the other, we\u2019re going to need mass migration. They can\u2019t both be correct.\u201d Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, said after the meeting that ministers had a \u201cgood, healthy discussion\u201d and said that the prime minister told those present that \u201cwe are going to keep our calm, hold our nerve\u201d. Government sources also dismissed suggestions that Javid wanted EU citizens to be allowed through the border for a transition period of 30 months if Britain left without a deal. They said that the proposal was one of several raised at a cabinet sub-committee a while ago but no agreement had been reached, and that the 30-month figure has been revised downwards since then. Ministers are waiting for the EU to come back with its detailed counter-proposals to the Chequers plan in mid-October before deciding what do to next, despite an energetic \u201cchuck Chequers\u201d campaign being fronted by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob-Rees Mogg. The trio tried to step up the pressure on May ahead of conference following the publication of a report by the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank that proposed a deregulated, free-trade future for the UK. Rees-Mogg told May that she needs to recognise that Chequers does not have much support and that she should think carefully about switching tack to propose that the UK strikes a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU after Brexit. The chairman of the hard Brexit-backing European Research Group described May as \u201ca lady of singular wisdom\u201d who was \u201clikely to recognise the reality that Chequers doesn\u2019t have much support\u201d and that \u201cwith her wisdom and insight she\u2019ll think carefully about adopting it\u201d. The MP was speaking an an event attended by a string of critics of May\u2019s Chequers plan, including former Brexit secretary Davis. The group claims the plan would leave the UK forced to share regulations for food and goods with the EU after Brexit. Rees-Mogg said he believed that because the EU had \u201csnubbed the prime minister\u201d by appearing to reject Chequers at the Salzburg summit last week, the only options were a no-deal Brexit or to propose a last-minute free-trade agreement. He argued that it would be popular with the British public, and said \u201cif we go to the House of Commons it would be passed\u201d. But at a morning press briefing held at the same time as the IEA event, Downing Street dismissed the idea that a Canada-type free trade agreement could work. Shanker Singham, director of the international trade and competition unit at the IEA, called on ministers to rethink their Brexit strategy. Singham, speaking at the launch of the alternative Brexit plan, said the government\u2019s white paper would \u201cabsolutely preclude\u201d a free-trade agreement with the US. Singham\u2019s report argues that the UK should try to deregulate in comparison to the EU. He said: \u201cMembership of the European Union stifles prosperity just as it prevents the UK governing itself. It saddles the UK with regulations that protect large incumbent businesses from competition, harming innovation and reducing efficiency.\u201d Davis said the UK\u2019s negotiations with the EU had reached a \u201ccul de sac\u201d. He said that the EU\u2019s rejection of Chequers at Salzburg was \u201call too predictable\u201d and it would have happened either there or at the European summit due next month. Boris Johnson did not attend the IEA event, but was quick to praise the report entitled Plan A+ on social media. He tweeted:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
