John Gosden\u2019s charge, winner of the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe for the last two years, is being aimed at a hot-looking Eclipse Stakes on Saturday but her team could hardly be in better form, as trainer and jockey teamed up for a big-race double at Saint-Cloud on Sunday. \u201cShe\u2019s really well, I\u2019m very pleased with her,\u201d Dettori said of Enable, whom he had ridden in work three times in the previous eight days. Gallop reports from Newmarket have been very positive about her in recent weeks and her jockey evidently feels the same way. \u201cShe\u2019s really come on and she\u2019s ready for the run. We\u2019re very pleased with her,\u201d he said. Unbeaten since April 2017, Enable is just a 7-4 shot for the Eclipse, even though her opponents may include Crystal Ocean, Circus Maximus, Sea Of Class, Magical, Too Darn Hot, Hermosa and Masar. Dettori was speaking after partnering Coronet to victory in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, a race in which the pair were beaten a nose last year. Things looked distinctly unpromising at the turn for home, when Dettori wanted to switch off the rail to move around the leaders but was forced back inside by Micka\u00ebl Barzalona determinedly sticking to his line on Morgan Le Faye. Luckily for the eventual winner, Ziyad hung right, leaving a gap which Coronet was brave enough to take and the grey prevailed by a short neck, with her stablemate Lah Ti Dar finishing strongly to be a close third. \u201cI was trying to bully my way out with Micka\u00ebl,\u201d Dettori reflected, \u201cbut he had too much horse. I saw a gap on the inside and dived for that. It was taking a chance but luckily Maxime [Guyon] didn\u2019t go back to the rail and left it open for me and it got the race won.\u201d Gosden and Dettori left the track with plenty of French prize money, as they also landed a Group Two with Mehdaayih, who had been thoroughly shoved around by rivals when only seventh in the Oaks a month earlier. She holds entries in Goodwood\u2019s Nassau Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks, which was also suggested by Gosden as a target for Coronet. British stables made a clean sweep of the major races at Saint-Cloud, where Charlie Appleby\u2019s Art Du Val won a Listed prize and Headman was impressive in landing the Prix Eug\u00e8ne Adam, a Group Two, for Roger Charlton. Headman provided his 19-year-old jockey, Jason Watson, with a first success in France. \u201cThese are the sort of horses you dream of riding,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
