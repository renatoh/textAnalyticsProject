Suffice to say that the International Rugby Board's blurb before this year's competition tells us there was a worldwide television audience of more than 3.1 billion when the World Cup was staged four years ago, which, the IRB proudly tells us, ranks the competition behind only soccer's World Cup and the Olympic Games as the biggest global attraction in sport. Consider these figures. The population of China is about 1.28 billion and India one billion, give or take the odd few million. For goodness sake, there are only 6.3 billion in the entire world and, last time I checked, vast swaths of the planet simply do not give a monkey's about the rugby. So exactly how the figures add up is anybody's guess. Doubtless some geek can justify them but - call me cynical if you like - this all smacks a little of creative accounting. And much as I enjoy a day out at Twickenham, please don't begin to tell me rugby is a game of the masses. Take a walk through the champagne glasses, picnic tables, four-wheel-drives, Bentleys and Mercs on the west car park and the elitist truth is still pretty much as apparent as it ever was. MCC members can look decidedly down-at-heel in comparison. And, when it comes down to the business end of matters in Australia, the World Cup will be dominated by the same old suspects on the pitch. Perhaps more so this year than ever. In all probability only two teams, England and New Zealand, have a realistic chance of winning the thing. Ah, watch for France, I hear you say. On what basis? Because they produced arguably the performance of the competition four years ago when they beat the All Blacks in the semi-finals? The recent warm-up matches against England allow only one sensible conclusion to be drawn, namely that France do not have an earthly. The romantics might have pointed to Ireland as possible northern hemisphere pretenders before they were summarily buried 42-6 by grand-slam-winning England. Now their chances can only be viewed as infinitesimally slight. As for Wales and Scotland . . . perhaps not. World Cup it may be, but it all looks so tediously predictable. And things are not very much better south of the equator, where the thuggish South Africans have regressed so dramatically and reprehensibly since Nelson Mandela jumped for joy as his emergent Rainbow Nation lifted the cup by beating New Zealand at Ellis Park eight years ago. And, with due apologies to Namibia, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Argentina and the rest, that leaves only Australia and New Zealand. The form line between the Wallabies and the All Blacks has swayed emphatically towards New Zealand. So there we have it. A New Zealand versus England final on November 22, when Clive Woodward's team have a truly outstanding chance of being acclaimed champions. Great stuff but, if the IRB and the bloatedly wealthy giants of the games are brutally honest, champions of not very much. The growth of professionalism might please those attracted by the finer points of the game. Unquestionably, playing standards have risen but the cash pouring into the leading nations has arguably been to the detriment of the rest. What is the benefit for the game if all that happens is that stadiums such as Twickenham become ever swankier venues for wealthy fans to watch their heroes? And, as the gap between the haves and the have-nots widens, am I alone in thinking few in positions of power really care? In 1987 Wales reached the semi-finals, and four years later Scotland enjoyed similar success. Now such an eventuality is well nigh unthinkable as what might be referred to as the game's second tier of nations drift further and further behind the elite. Meanwhile the true minnows, teams such as Namibia and Georgia, are so cash-strapped they barely had the reserves to assemble a properly prepared team to make the journey to Australia. England's opening match against Georgia has all the competitive appeal of a public execution, even if the television stats men tell us this inevitable slaughter is taking the game to ever bigger audiences. Alternative forms of entertainment, like the weekly shop, a spot of dentistry or cutting back the tree that has needed attention all summer, begin to look distinctly attractive. The IRB itself set itself the goal of one nation from outside the established powers of the game making it through into the quarter-finals of the World Cup by 2007. It might have seemed a worthy and laudable ambition a decade ago, but such a development is now inconceivable. Lip service is paid to the concept of expansion, with regional development officers employed by the IRB with responsibility for propagating the game on all five continents, and the boast is that the game is now played in more than 100 countries. But the truth of the situation is rather more prosaic. At least in cricket Kenya had their moments in the World Cup and Bangladesh are making strides to indicate they are nearing readiness to take a place among the major Test-playing nations. Meanwhile, athletics' governing body the IAAF enjoys the affiliation of 210 member federations around the world. At the recent world championships in Paris, the best female athlete was Maria Mutola, an 800-metre runner from the disadvantaged country of Mozambique, and the winner of the blue riband event, the men's 100m, was Kim Collins, whose Caribbean country St Kitts and Nevis has a total population of only some 40,000. Athletics, it strikes me, is light years ahead of rugby when it comes to global reach. So too football. For all the money slushing around the European club game, attracting most of the top players from South America and Africa, when it comes to the World Cup it truly is a global event with worldwide appeal. Witness the crowds and the fervent support for South Korea and Japan, and the emergence of teams from Africa. It is part of the appeal of Fifa's jewel that a team such as Senegal are capable of upsetting the aristocrats of France. But the safe bet for rugby's World Cup is that there will not be an upset, there will be no glorious moment when the lion's tail is tweaked by the unconsidered upstart, and most of the early matches will be played out in an atmosphere where the ho-hum factor is tangible. England's gallant men set out on the long journey to Perth with the best wishes of the nation, and certainly with their most realistic chance of glory since the inauguration of the competition in 1987. But let's not get carried away with the hype. It's England versus New Zealand, maybe Australia, with South Africa and France as mere irritants somewhere behind. Rugby is a great game but there is a huge distance to go before it should be mentioned in the same breath as soccer or athletics, whatever the television viewing statistics might have us believe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
