In the letter he states: \"According to the team principals, in the event of a serious accident such as the one involving Ayrton Senna in 1994, a local magistrate could use the EAW procedure to order the immediate arrest of team personnel in their home country and have them taken in custody to the country where the accident occurred, where they could be locked up until trial.\" Senna died when he crashed his Williams-Renault while leading the 1994 San Marino grand prix at Imola. Patrick Head, the Williams technical director and his then chief designer Adrian Newey, now McLaren's technical director, were told last year they must face a new appeal court hearing into the Senna accident even though both were acquitted of manslaughter at a trial in Bologna in 1997, a verdict upheld on appeal two years later. The teams are warning that they are prepared to race only in countries where the authorities provide a legally enforceable undertaking not to use the new EAW in connection with formula one accidents. They claim immediate action is needed in Britain, Belgium and Spain, the three countries where the new legislation was introduced on schedule on January 1. Germany, France and Italy have pledged to implement the legislation by March after which grand prix racing returns to Europe. Meanwhile the sport's governing body has poured cold water on Renault's plans to introduce a second division grand prix feeder category to replace formula 3000 from the start of the 2005 season. Renault have apparently announced plans for their new formula, which will rely on Italian Dallara chassis powered by relatively low-revving four-litre V8 engines developing around 600 horsepower, before clearing the necessary details with the FIA. The result was a distinctly frosty response from Mosley. \"The FIA has noted the Renault press release regarding the proposed formula GP2 series, one of several Renault promotional series,\" he said. \"Like any other private series Renault GP2 cars can run during formula one world championship weekends, subject to making the necessary commercial arrangements with formula one management, the commercial rights holder. \"The FIA has not yet seen any proposed technical or sporting regulations relating to this series. When received the draft regulations will be considered in the usual way.\" Formula 3000 has suffered from dwindling entries over the past few seasons and it is hoped that formula GP2 will help train engineers and mechanics as well as drivers for the world championship arena. Insiders believe the governing body will be broadly supportive of the new series, once Renault has eaten a suitably large slice of humble pie after what seems to have been an embarrassing procedural gaffe. The Dutch driver Jos Verstappen is expected to be confirmed today as the No1 driver for the Jordan-Ford team this season and plans to test the team's existing 2003 car in Barcelona this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
