Liverpool\u2019s supporters have long been renowned as a detached and indifferent bunch who could never be accused of being even remotely sentimental, but The Fiver is prepared to bet even those Koppites with the flintiest of hearts shed a salty tear upon hearing their former hero, Fernando Torres, has announced his retirement. Madrile\u00f1o by birth but Scouse by the grace of God, the freckle-faced striker who achieved hero status with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid by helping to secure their return to the Spanish top flight before his move to Merseyside may look 12 years old, but is in fact 35. And following a long and largely successful career in which he won such insignificant baubles as a World Cup, two European Championships, one Big Cup, two Big Vases and an FA Cup, he has finally decided to put himself out to pasture. \u201cI have something very important to announce,\u201d he declared on social media disgraces today, before a statement you just kind of knew wouldn\u2019t comprise him effing and jeffing his way around a messy Miami hotel room. \u201cAfter 18 exciting years, the time has come to put an end to my football career. Next Sunday, the 23rd at 10am local time in Japan, I will have a press conference in Tokyo to explain all the details. See you there.\u201d While it is in Japan, with Sagan Tosu, that Torres has been playing out his dotage, it is his spells with his boyhood club Atl\u00e9tico and Liverpool for which he will be best remembered. \u201cAtl\u00e9tico is my club but I still support Liverpool and I want them to win every game, every trophy,\u201d he told Simon Hughes in 2017, when the writer travelled to the outskirts of Madrid to get the skinny on a certain ill-fated \u00a350m move to Chelsea. Citing irreconcilable differences between himself and a board he felt demonstrated an obvious lack of ambition by selling off all their best players, Torres decided to join the exodus for the door marked Do One. \u201cThe stories that appeared in the press changed the view of everybody including myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not the truth. The truth was that I moved from my home to a club that was ready to win. When I left, there was not a single piece of the winning culture left.\u201d Despite going on to win an enviable amount of silverware with clubs elsewhere, Torres won nothing at Liverpool beyond local hearts. \u201cThe reason to move was to win trophies and I did,\u201d he explained, when asked if he wished he hadn\u2019t moved to Chelsea. \u201cIt is silly to regret something you wanted but maybe you realise it does not bring you contentment.\u201d Now all grown up and with a great and glorious future behind him, we hope the \u201cThe Kid\u201d \u2013 one of football\u2019s gents \u2013 has achieved all he\u2019d ever hoped for. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Paul Doyle from 9pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Egypt 2-0 Zimbabwe in the Africa Cup of Nations, assuming the hosts\u2019 opponents don\u2019t boycott the game, as some reports claim. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI just thought: \u2018Life\u2019s too short, I\u2019m not enjoying football, I do have other interests,\u2019 so it was the right time to do it. My mum would have been exactly the same as my auntie, crying her eyes out if she had seen me on a horse. Even when she came and watched me play football, if someone hit me too hard she would be really annoyed and be like: \u2018What are they doing to my baby?\u2019\u201d \u2013 former Coventry midfielder Jay Tabb on how he switched careers to being a wee jockey with ambitions to ride at the Cheltenham Festival. FIVER LETTERS \u201cMore disturbing internet searches (Fiver letters passim). I typed \u2018funny tea-timely email\u2019 into a search engine. The Fiver came up as the ninth result. Ninth!\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. \u201cI saw Jesse Lingard\u2019s buffoonery on social media disgraces and couldn\u2019t quite make up my mind. On the one hand it\u2019s social media disgraces, so watch it or don\u2019t, who really cares? However, on the other, footballers need to be careful. When QPR went down several of their players were seen on the pitch laughing and goofing around, which caused some pretty deep resentment from a lot of fans. As did Joleon Lescott\u2019s \u00a3122,000 car photo as Villa were relegated. Football players are ludicrously privileged and enjoy astronomical salaries, many, many times the national average and they need to be very careful people don\u2019t see behind the curtain. If footballers want to continue bathing in baubles and trinkets, they need to wise up and play the part they\u2019re given. I don\u2019t think it will be much longer until the bubble bursts, so it\u2019s probably best they don\u2019t help poke at it with sticks\u201d \u2013 Marten Allen. \u201cFrank Lampard\u2019s Derby County finished one point above Middlesbrough last season. Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County\u2019s Frank Lampard is being targeted for a top-four Premier League job, while Tony Pulis at Boro gets his P45. Maybe Tony needs a few more cheerleaders in the media?\u201d \u2013 Nigel Walker. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Players\u2019 union Fifpro has called on Africa Cup of Nations organisers to provide four drinks breaks instead of two to stop players overheating in Egypt. \u201cThe health and safety of the players must come first,\u201d said a Fifpro suit. \u201cAny play in temperatures over 34C would mean there is an extremely high risk.\u201d Petr Cech has returned to Chelsea as technical and performance advisor, which means he will probably have the unglamorous task of keeping count of all the tyros out on loan. \u201cI [want to] help create the best possible high-level performance environment to continue the success the club has had over the past 15 years,\u201d he cheered, while setting up his abacus. Antonio Conte still has a Romelu Lukaku itch to scratch, it seems. Uruguay aren\u2019t through to the Copa Am\u00e9rica last eight just yet after drawing 2-2 with South American powerhouses \u2026 oh, Japan. Perhaps because young Dutch pups are so hot right now or perhaps because his dad is Frenkie de Jong\u2019s Mr 15%, Barcelona B have slapped an \u00a389.2m release fee on 20-year-old right-back Mike van Beijnen, who they\u2019ve just scooped up on a free. It\u2019s crunch time for England\u2019s U-21s. And Class of 92 plaything Salford City will face Nasty Leeds in the first round of the Rumbelows Cup after Ray Parlour and EhJohnEhBarnes plucked their balls out of a tub somewhere near the meat counter in a north London Morrisons.
