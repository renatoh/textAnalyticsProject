Oxfordshire coroner Nicholas Gardiner has said the hearing will examine any relevant matters not covered or submitted in the Hutton inquiry. Mr Gardiner said on Oxfordshire County Council's website that the hearing at County Hall, Oxford, on March 16 was \"for the purpose of hearing representations from properly interested persons\". \"The matter will be dealt with in open court. Those whose claims to be properly interested persons are accepted have already been so advised, \" he added. The body of 59-year-old Dr Kelly was found at a beauty spot near his Oxfordshire home in July, just days after he was exposed as the source of a BBC report which alleged the British government had \"sexed up\" intelligence on Iraq and its reported weapons of mass destruction. The inquest was adjourned under Section 17a of the 1988 Coroner's Act while the inquiry was held. Lord Hutton concluded Dr Kelly had taken his own life - the result of an incision to the left wrist and after taking co-proxamol painkillers. The hearing starts at 10am. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
