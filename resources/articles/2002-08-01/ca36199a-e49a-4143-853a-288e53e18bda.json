The supplier of disposable and cleaning products to supermarkets and hotels has seen demand for outsourcing blossom with the slowdown as businesses seek to cut costs. Finance director David Williams said the business had proved hardy in a difficult economic climate with a 7% sales rise. Last month the firm completed the sale of its paper distribution unit to Australia's largest paper-maker, PaperlinX, for \u00a3138.8m. It will focus on higher margin and growth businesses instead. Paying off loans to cost less Paying off a personal loan early is expected to become less costly after the government yesterday said it intended to scrap rules which penalise people who want to settle up before the specified date. The Department of Trade and Industry is proposing to abandon the so-called \"rule of 78\" formula which some lenders use to calculate how much borrowers must pay when they settle early. The DTI says the rule tends to overestimate the outstanding loan balance, and plans a \"more accurate\" formula. The move is likely to save a typical consumer about \u00a350 on their loan. Those people with larger loans could save hundreds or even thousands of pounds. Hedge growth in a cold climate Man Group, the world's largest hedge fund manager with $21bn (\u00a314bn) in assets, launched a capital-guaranteed, structured hedge fund product yesterday with a medium term annualised growth target of 17-18%. Andreas Benz, a regional manager for Man Investment Products, said the company hoped to raise up to $250m for the new product. Man Group, the world's only publicly traded hedge fund management group, has benefited from recent stock market volatility, enjoying a $1bn inflow of funds - mostly from private clients - in the three months to June 30. 400 jobs go at Siemens plant Leading turbine manufacturer Siemens Power Generation announced it would shed 400 jobs because of a global downturn in demand for power plants. SPG said production of steam turbines would be phased out at its Newcastle plant over the two years from late November. The firm will retain 300 staff to concentrate on servicing operations; its sales arm in Berkshire will not be affected. Smits quits KPN debt mountain Dutch telecoms group KPN said yesterday that Paul Smits, head of KPN Mobile, under whose management the group's debt has ballooned, will resign from the board on November 1 for personal reasons. Pending the appointment of a successor, KPN chief executive Ad Scheepbouwer will take over as head of the group's mobile phone operations. Mr Smits was in charge when KPN dreamed of joining the European telecoms premier league, taking the group on a spree for acquisitions and UMTS licences. Debt levels reached \u20ac23bn (\u00a314.7bn)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
