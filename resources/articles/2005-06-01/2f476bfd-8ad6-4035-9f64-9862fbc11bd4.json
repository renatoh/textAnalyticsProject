He was, he admitted, the \"man in the cardigan\", and provided, as the Encyclopaedia of British Film put it, \"a wonderful gallery of under-achievers\". In 1960, he appeared in The Angry Silence and The League Of Gentlemen: both starred his friend Richard Attenborough and were written by another friend, Bryan Forbes. Forbes directed Bird in Whistle Down The Wind (1961), The Wrong Box (1966) and The Raging Moon (1970). In the last, Bird had a particularly good role as Nanette Newman's father - despite the fact that there was only a nine-year age gap between them. Bird was also memorable in Victim (1961), Term Of Trial (1962), The Hill (1965), The Virgin And The Gypsy (1970) and Hands Of The Ripper (1971). He was the voice of Bilbo Baggins in the animated version of The Lord Of The Rings (1978) and wasin hundreds of radio productions, most recently Dead Men Tell No Tales (2000). But it was television that employed him most. He had a rare leading role opposite Patricia Routledge in the play Up Among The Cuckoos in 1970 and was a regular as Mr Braithwaite in Worzel Gummidge (1979-81). Otherwise he played policemen, clerks and aldermen in episodes of almost every major drama series. Typically, he was the stuffy figure of fun in sitcoms, such as Bless This House, The Fenn Street Gang, Rising Damp and Yes, Minister. Born in Coalville, Leicestershire, Bird left school at 16 and spent six months working in an office before studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. There he began his lifelong friendships with Attenborough and Forbes. Demobbed from the Royal Air Force in 1947, he appeared with repertory companies in Henley-on-Thames, Dundee and Northampton. In 1950, Bird joined Gielgud's company, understudying for Christopher Fry's The Lady's Not For Burning, which toured the United States. He made his London stage debut in Peter Brook's production of The Winter's Tale at the Phoenix theatre in 1951. He continued with stage work, but knowing he was not going to be a leading man, he grew a moustache to qualify for older character parts. Then, in the mid-1950s, his screen career began. In 1990 he claimed that Stay Lucky, a comedy series with Dennis Waterman, provided his 200th TV appearance. He played a taxi driver in Richard Attenborough's film Shadowlands (1993), and was last seen on TV in the political drama Crossing The Floor (1996). His popularity was due not only to his skills, but also his unfailing courtesy and humour. He had met his wife Nona Blair (Joan Hood in radio's The Archers) in rep in Northampton. They married in 1954. In 1992 they moved to Bridgnorth, Shropshire, to be nearer to their children. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and five grandchildren. \u00b7 Norman Bird, actor, born October 30 1924; died April 22 2005"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
