Blizzard has announced that World of Warcraft add-on, The Burning Crusade, will be released on January 16. It's no wonder Vivendi Games is keen to get it out there - the company has just announced its third quarter earnings, recording revenues of Euro182 million. That's 15.2 percent up on the previous year - mostly thanks to WoW. Fans will be able to opt for the standard release or a limited edition, which includes (deep breath): \"...the Art of the Burning Crusade coffee table book, an exclusive in-game pet, a behind-the-scenes DVD, two World of Warcraft Trading Card Game starter decks and three exclusive cards, a map of Outland mouse pad and the official soundtrack CD.\" Exclusive in-game pet? Are there going to be night elves wandering the Blasted Lands accompanied by loveable labrador puppies? I really hope so. The company has also revealed that the subscriber base has now hit 7.5 million players worldwide, which means Azeroth now has a larger population than Switzerland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
