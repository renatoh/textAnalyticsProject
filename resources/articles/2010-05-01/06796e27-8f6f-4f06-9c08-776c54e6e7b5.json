We meet Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg at his home in leafy Ecclesall. The garden is a little overgrown and Clegg's colleague, Richard Allan, jokes he can't claim for a gardener after the expenses scandal. The interview is conducted around the kitchen table, Clegg makes the coffee, and his wife Miriam joins us. Daniel missed out on voting in the last election by three months. After completing his masters in applied cognitive neuroscience at Sheffield Hallam University, he is now an associate lecturer there. Daniel Fenton, 22, Sheffield: Young people are traditionally very apathetic when it comes to politics, and only 61.4% of potential voters actually voted in the last general election. Do you think there's an underlying belief that nothing will change under a new government? Nick Clegg: I think it's more than an underlying belief. Lots of people think \"What's the point, they're all the same, making promises then breaking them.\" A lot of young people feel they're just not being listened to. There's a very profound disaffection. I think we're in a democratic crisis. In the last two general elections, for the first time in modern British history, more people didn't vote than voted for the winning party. Fenton: So how would you restore young people's faith in politics? Clegg: It sounds incredibly trite, but young people need to feel listened to. We've had a long period where young people were portrayed negatively and vilified. We've criminalised young people on an industrial scale. We need to put an end to this anti-youth authoritarian populism. One of the other things we can change is to lower the voting age. Fenton: To 16? Clegg: Yes. If you as a government can ask teenagers to lay their lives on the line in the military, the least you can do is give them the right to vote for the people who are asking them to potentially die. I also think young people don't want to be told by politicians how to live their lives. This idea that you have to get married in a particular way, for three quid a week [a Tory tax incentive], is incomprehensible to me. Getting married is one of the best things that ever happened to me, but I did it for love, I didn't do it for three quid a week. Fenton: More young people are planning to go to university than ever, but both graduates and unskilled young workers face increased unemployment. How do you plan to combat this? Clegg: I think the assumption that the only good thing to do is go to university is just plain wrong. I'm a huge supporter of moving to parity of esteem and funding for further education and higher education, to break down this apartheid between academic and vocational education. We also know a bright but poor child will be overtaken at school by the age of seven by a less bright but wealthy child, and after that the gap will widen. Which is why one of our big emphases is to reduce class sizes and provide more one-to-one tuition. Fenton: How do you plan to fund these changes? Clegg: You have to cut things. So we would cut the child trust fund, which costs half a billion a year, to give 18-year-olds a cheque for \u00a3250. We would cut the top 20% of recipients of tax credits. I'm on about \u00a364,000 as a backbench MP, a good salary, and I'm eligible for tax credits, which is crazy. There are also long-term choices such as saying no to the like-for-like replacement of Trident. We also have a specific revenue raiser, which is a 10% levy on banks' profits. If you want to insulate the country from over-leveraged banks taking risks with your savings, you've got to split off risky banking from high street banking. Fenton: So what would the bad news be for people if you were elected? Clegg: The bad news would be that if you are very wealthy and exploit loopholes in the tax system you will pay more. If you live in a mansion worth over \u00a32m you will pay more. If you're avoiding tax on an industrial scale, as many companies are, you will pay more. But they would be paying more firstly to deliver the fair tax break, so you don't pay any tax on the first \u00a310,000 you earn; secondly, to start paying off the deficit; and thirdly, to pay for smaller class sizes, reduced tuition fees and so on. You can't promise people something for nothing. David Cameron thinks you can, but you can't. Fenton: You've said, \"Politics shouldn't be a beauty pageant.\" Do you think there's more emphasis on personality than policy? Clegg: I think there's always been a mix. In the days of Gladstone and Lloyd George, it was infused with personality. With Disraeli and Gladstone it was a personalised battle. It's always been a mix. Fenton: Cameron and Brown have both brought their families into the election, but you've been careful to\u2026 Clegg: You're sitting in my kitchen, with my wife\u2026 Fenton: But you've generally kept your family out of the spotlight. Clegg: Our children yes, Miriam and I \u2013 [to Miriam] you should chip in if you want \u2013 took a decision at the beginning. I'm a father before I'm a politician \u2013I couldn't live with myself if what I did in any way affects my children \u2013 so we decided to talk about our children, but not stick them in front of a camera. And Miriam has her own career; she can't just stop for three and a half weeks. Fenton: Was it a bonus for the Lib Dems to be on the same TV platform as Labour and the Conservatives in the leaders' debates? Clegg: You make it sound like a concession! People just don't agree with the old duopoly of politics. We have an election system that is unfair to us \u2013 almost one in four people who voted in the last election voted for us. It's preposterous that in every other area of life we have lots of choices, from holidays to the food we buy, but in politics, you, Daniel, are told it's only a choice between two. Fenton: When you say the election system is unfair\u2026 Clegg: It's not democratic. You've got a man in power, Gordon Brown, whose party only got 22% of the eligible vote. Conversely, we got almost one in four votes and only got 10% of the seats. Millions in this country are ignored because they live in safe Labour or Conservative constituencies, and the politicians are all chasing a tiny fraction of the electorate in swing seats. That's why Westminster has become so corrupt \u2013 there's a correlation between MPs in safe seats and having fleeced their expenses. That's why the link between the expenses scandal and the need for more radical reform is, in my view, a very strong one. Fenton: Do you really think there will be a big shake-up? Clegg: There should be. It all depends on whether Brown and Cameron bamboozle people into thinking, \"Oh well, we're not allowed to do anything different.\" Let me be really blunt: there is a massive betrayal going on \u2013 Brown and Cameron are telling people they want new politics, but when the cameras are switched off, they block any reform every step of the way. They blocked the cross-party deal we supported to clean up party funding. Why? Because Brown wanted to protect his trade union paymasters and Cameron wanted to protect his sugar daddy in his offshore haven in Belize. There's a huge con going on. The choice is clear \u2013 either we call time on corrupt old politics or, if it's up to Labour and the Conservatives, the same rotten system will carry on. Fenton: How will you relax during the run-up to the election? Clegg: Cycle, walk... and children are the greatest antidote to politics you can imagine. They don't give a stuff that there's an election on, they want Dad to play football in the park. Fenton: Finally, what kind of music do you like? Clegg: Very eclectic \u2013 Johnny Cash, Radiohead. Our kids are learning the piano so there's a lot of classical music in the house. The one music I've never really got into is jazz. Daniel Fenton's verdict: \"I thought he seemed quite genuine and passionate about changing politics. He was interested in the questions, which was good considering he's in the middle of an election campaign. Occasionally he tried to give a slightly long-winded politician's answer, but I'd like to think I pressed him on the important points. Although I was interviewing him objectively, I was fairly certain I was going to vote Lib Dem and he did enough to keep my vote.\" Jeremy Hunt We meet Jeremy Hunt, 43, the shadow secretary of state for culture, media and sport, and the man considered the rising star of the Tory party, at the home of a fellow local Conservative in Godalming. Olivia is from the village of Bramley, now part of Hunt's Southwest Surrey constituency, and a student in her final year at nearby Charterhouse (the public school where Hunt was once head boy). Olivia Lace-Evans, 18, Surrey: I did consider myself a Conservative voter, but having watched the televised leaders' debates I found my certainty shaken. Do you think David Cameron lacked substance in his arguments? Jeremy Hunt: I think what happened wasn't anything to do with David Cameron. I thought he gave excellent answers that were very reasoned. What happened was Nick Clegg put in an excellent TV performance, and the country hadn't seen Nick Clegg before. There was a tremendous novelty value and it changed the dynamics of the election. Lace-Evans: Two-thirds of the electorate say one of their priorities is seeing a change within parliament. Do you think Nick Clegg has stolen the idea of \"change\"? Hunt: He certainly has taken that mantle this week, but as the penny has dropped about the implication of an increase in the Lib Dems' support, they are getting a great deal more scrutiny than before. If you want real change, that's offered by the Conservatives. David Cameron has radically changed the party: from green issues, to our approach to the NHS, to international development, it's a very different, modern Conservative party. If you look at the expenses scandal, David didn't redo his kitchen three times in six months, which is what Nick Clegg did. For Clegg to say he and his party are different is wrong. Lace-Evans: Are class stereotypes one of the reasons David Cameron isn't trusted as much as the other two leaders? Cameron went to Eton then Oxford, and Clegg went to Westminster then Cambridge, but Cameron receives far more stick. Hunt: Well, I went to Charterhouse, as you know, and I've never made a secret of that. I'm a Conservative because I went to state school first, and then into private education, and I've always been shocked by what radically different chances people have, based on the type of education they receive. The class system is so much stronger than it ought to be. I want to have a society in which everyone gets the chance to make the most of their talents. Even David Cameron's fiercest critics will accept he has never pretended that he didn't go to Eton. He's never tried to change his accent or his mannerisms. When he gave that speech without notes [at the 2007 Conservative party conference] he said, \"This is who I am, you've got to decide if this is the person you want to be prime minister, yes or no.\" (We've had some great prime ministers who went to public school and some great prime ministers who didn't go to public school.) Lace-Evans: The recent reductions in university capacity due to recession and cuts has meant a number of my friends and myself received no university offers, despite high grade predictions. Do you think Gordon Brown's pledge to have 50% of school leavers go to university is realistic? Hunt: Well, first of all, I'm really sorry to hear that. On the target, I think it was the right intention, but the wrong way of going about it. The idea that people should stay in education is a good one. But the mistake the government made is setting an artificial target, because everyone concentrates on that rather than making sure the quality is of the highest level. I think we have also neglected old-fashioned apprenticeships of skills that were widely respected. Lace-Evans: Only 56% of voters under the age of 25 have registered to vote. Why is there so much apathy? Hunt: I think the whole political class has failed. I think young people really do care about politics, but they just see politicians point scoring, rather than doing what is right for the long-term future of the country. I think you need a government that is prepared to be unpopular. Even Margaret Thatcher's sternest critics would say she was someone who had integrity and stuck to her guns when it was unpopular. I think David Cameron is that sort of person. Lace-Evans: In your manifesto, David Cameron talks about dispersing power, but whereas Gordon Brown is looking at electoral reform and proportional representation, Cameron is looking at reducing the number of MPs in the Commons, which wouldn't really change things. Hunt: I'm sorry that's how you interpret it, because I think David Cameron has led the way. Electoral reform is something we desperately need, but I don't think the British people want anything that will make it harder to sack a government they don't like. The great problem with proportional representation is that it muddies the water: people vote for parties and politicians haggle over who is going to be prime minister. There are flaws in the current system, but one of the great things is the ability of the people to kick a government out. Lace-Evans: As shadow secretary for the arts, how can you reassure people the arts wouldn't suffer under the Conservatives? Hunt: Because Labour has plundered the National Lottery for its own pet projects, the amount of money going from the Lottery to the arts has halved since 1997, so we would put that right. We would also encourage people to support the arts privately. I think if you speak to people in the arts community they will tell you that in terms of new policy ideas it's the Conservatives that have been leading the agenda. Lace-Evans: How would the BBC be affected if you were elected? Hunt: The BBC has the most important role in this country in scrutinising politicians, and fundamental to that is the government having an arms-length relationship with the BBC. We think the BBC is a unique institution, but we also need strong competition, whether it's ITV, Channel 4 or Sky\u2026 and the Observer and local newspapers. The independent sector is struggling, so we need to make sure it thrives. Lace-Evans: Do you envisage running for prime minister one day? Hunt: I don't. What I want to be is culture secretary. We desperately want to give government the direction it's lacked for so long. Olivia Lace-Evans's verdict: \"I wouldn't say I was completely decided, but I am a little clearer in my mind. Jeremy seems adamant about the Conservatives' position. I'm still not convinced about David Cameron, if I'm honest, but as a whole party, I have a better idea of their vision than the Lib Dems'.\" David Miliband We meet David Miliband at his unassuming semi-detached home in his constituency of South Shields, where he has just arrived from the previous night's leaders' debate in Bristol. David Trotter, after completing a two-year apprenticeship at Nissan, is now studying for a BTEC in Business Studies at South Tyneside College. He also works part-time at Iceland as a duty manager. He was thinking of voting Conservative, like his father, but the debates have made him question that. David Trotter, 18, South Shields: Having spoken to fellow students, only 20% had a real understanding of politics or interest in the election. How can you engage more young people? David Miliband: I think the most important thing I can do locally is be available in schools and the college and elsewhere, and try and explain why politics makes a difference. Your apprenticeship wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for politics, nor would the new school buildings, extra teachers and the minimum wage. I also think we've got to understand our history. When I first came to South Shields in 2001, a woman called Ella Roberts was at my selection meeting. She was born in 1907, so she was 94, and she remembered the first meeting of the women's section of the South Shields Labour Party in 1918, before women had the vote. She said to me: \"Young man, we fought for the vote, and you go and tell all those people out there that we didn't fight for the vote for them not to use it.\" The final thing is, you have to give people hope. This constituency was hit so hard in the 80s and 90s by recession, when the shipyards and mines went. It ravaged the area, and you've got to say to people, \"Look, it's not hopeless, you can actually build new industry \u2013 you can be the home of Europe's first electric car, by Nissan; you can be the offshore wind turbine centre of Britain, and those are the jobs of the future.\" Hope is really important. Trotter: Do you think there's an underlying belief in young people that nothing will change? Miliband: No I don't, actually. I think young people are very idealistic. Sometimes you can talk to them about very big issues, like climate change or international poverty, and they think they can make a difference. But when you talk to them about jobs they can be quite down. I don't believe young people are cynical, I think they're sceptical, which is probably a good thing. Trotter: Is the Labour target of 50% of young people going to university realistic? Miliband: Yes. Why should England be different from Scotland, which has 50%-plus going to university, or America? Why should this country have a more elitist education system? David Cameron says you must be \"brazenly elitist\" in education, but that means leaving people out. If you get the grades and have the ability you should go to higher education. But we also say, don't forget about the other 50%. That's why there were hardly any apprenticeships in 1997; now there are 260,000 apprenticeships, and you have benefited from one. Trotter: Were you as surprised as everyone else by how much the televised debates have changed the election? Miliband: Yes. I'm pleased at the way the debates have stimulated interest. The obvious thing is people have got doubts about the Tories\u2026 Trotter: Do you not feel they've also got doubts about Labour? Miliband: Of course, we've been in government for 13 years, so people are looking around. They've been looking at the Tories for four years and thinking, \"Have you really changed, or are you the same old Tories?\" These debates are crystallising that. Trotter: Do you think the media coverage affects people's decisions? Miliband: The Daily Mail putting Clegg and the word \"Nazi\" in the same frontpage headline said to me that the Tory press are desperate. The media are important, but part of the job of politicians is to force them back to the issues. Trotter: Do you think the Lib Dems have a chance of getting in? Miliband: I think it's a fairly open race. It's a three-horse race. They would have to do a lot, but I think you could get any result out of this election. I still think the Conservatives are the biggest threat, especially to constituencies like this. They're a threat to our education, our policing, our health service, and our economy. Trotter: Are they a threat to the country, or just a threat to Labour getting back in? Miliband: I think they're a threat to the things that we value. A threat to our employment, a threat to our education and investment, a threat to our standing in the world. Just because they have had two bad debates, they're asleep, but they're not dead. Watch out. They are well funded and they haven't changed. Any party which is saying that one of their top priorities for tax is to give away \u00a3200,000 to 3,000 of the richest estates, by effectively abolishing inheritance tax, hasn't learnt that this is not a feudal country any more. Trotter: When Nick Clegg says he has all these bright new ideas, and will change things, do you think it's just words or\u2026 Miliband: I think he's got some substantial problems. For example, tax credits. If you're on a low income, rather than you paying tax we give you money back. He's saying we should scale that back. That would hit people in constituencies like this hard. He can't guarantee he will maintain health service funding. Your mum works for the health service, she's got to ask: \"How safe's my job?\" I think the Tories are weak on substance and the Lib Dems are soft on policy. Clegg doesn't want to replace Trident, but he doesn't know what we should have instead. That's soft on policy. I worked for the Labour Party when we were out of power and we spent three years getting our policies bombproof. We promised a minimum wage, but we figured out what it could be. We said we'd reduce class sizes but we figured out how we could pay for it\u2026 and I don't think they've done that. Trotter: Has the election become more about style than substance? Miliband: I think that's what the other two want. I think that's what Cameron was banking on, and he's been exposed. But the British people aren't stupid. They know that if you vote in The X Factor you're not obliged to download the winning song and listen to it for four years, whereas if you vote for the winning party in the election, they're going to govern the country. David Trotter's verdict: \"I thought he would be patronising to me, because I'm young, but he wasn't, he listened. He seemed quite strong in his beliefs, and I changed my mind quite a bit speaking to him. He knows how to use his words, doesn't he? But I was very impressed. I was heading towards Labour after watching the TV debates, and I'm definitely going to vote Labour now.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
