United have made 10 visits, including semi-finals, without losing once. This includes several draws, among them a scoreless replay in 1970 with Leeds, who won the third tie 2-0 at Bolton. But their last Cup defeat at Villa Park was in 1927 when Reading won 2-1 in the third round after draws at Elm Park and Old Trafford had taken the tie to a neutral venue. From time to time something comes over United in Birmingham B6 in the FA Cup and it is more likely to involve Ryan Giggs darting and swerving through Arsenal's defence to score the winner in the 1999 semi-final than Roy Keane getting a red card for stamping on Gareth Southgate, then with Crystal Palace, four years earlier. Tomorrow will be the first time they have played Villa there at this stage since 1948, when United won 6-4 in a match which retains strong claims to be the greatest ever FA Cup tie. Matt Busby's first great United side set a standard of attacking excellence. In Jimmy Delaney, Johnny Morris, Jack Rowley, Stan Pearson and Charlie Mitten United had a forward line which combined verve with versatility, teamwork with individuality. As the Times' Geoffrey Green recalled: \"They thought as one man and moved as one at top speed. Here was the sort of football one dreams about . . . \" On that grey January day in 1948 Villa were the ones pinching themselves, initially at least. Managed by Alex Massie, they were a fair-to-middling First Division side with an attack led by Trevor Ford and solid all-round ability in Sailor Brown, Dicky Dorsett and George Edwards. A crowd of 65,000 expected a thriller and once Villa had taken the lead in 13.5 seconds, without United touching the ball, the majority foresaw a home victory. What nobody anticipated was that by half-time United would be 5-1 ahead. The second half, however, all but stood the tie on its head. The pitch became a bog, United were bombarded from the air and by the 81st minute the score was 5-4. Pearson's late goal ensured victory for Busby's players but on that day no one deserved to be a loser. Green remembered Johnny Carey, Manchester United's captain and still the most exemplary leader on the field Old Trafford has seen, responding to Villa's opening goal with a \"wide courageous Irish smile\". \"If ever there was a tonic, that was it,\" he wrote. \"If ever there was the touch of captaincy, that was it.\" United fans of more than fiftysomething may still seethe at the memory of Peter McParland's reckless assault which broke Ray Wood's jaw in the 1957 final when Villa denied Busby's babes the first Double of the 20th century with a 2-0 victory, McParland putting both goals past the stand-in goalkeeper Jackie Blanchflower. Happily this kind of challenge is less likely to be repeated tomorrow than a Cup tie which may at least pay part-homage to its most illustrious predecessor. Another 10-goal thriller would be too much to expect. Five would do. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
