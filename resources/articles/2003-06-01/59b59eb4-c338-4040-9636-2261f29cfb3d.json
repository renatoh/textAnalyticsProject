The former Wimbledon champion from Spain had just scored her best win for eight months to overcome the fourth-seeded Daniela Hantuchova 6-2, 6-3, yet her enthusiasm seemed less for today's semi-final in the Hastings Direct Championships than for her next visit to the Bernabeu. \"I was quite shocked,\" she said, referring not to the speed with which her Slovakian opponent was blown away like a twig in the wind but to Real Madrid's acquisition of the England captain. \"I will go to watch him for sure. I haven't seen him play but I know he has a great touch.\" Hantuchova, whose weight loss has provided the headlines here this week, blamed the stiff sea breeze, which upset the toss on her serve, and 31-year-old Martinez's experience for her defeat. \"Any time I play her I always find it very difficult. She's been on the tour so long she knows everything about the game. She makes life awkward for me on court.\" Indeed Martinez exploited the wind with a game that looked as if it was developed on a seafront, delivering serves with the lowest toss in the game - not far above the right ear at times - in conditions that launched hats into orbit and at one stage of another quarter-final removed Chanda Rubin's cap while she was serving. That prompted the wily American title-holder to ask of the umpire if a point she had just lost might be replayed. That dispute was almost the only thing Rubin lost, her 6-1, 6-0 defeat of the former top-20 Israeli Anna Pistolesi setting up an all-American semi-final with Jennifer Capriati. Martinez now faces another surprise survivor, the unseeded Italian Silvia Farina, who recovered from a set and 0-3 down to beat last week's Edgbaston champion Magdalena Maleeva 5-7, 6-4, 6-4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
