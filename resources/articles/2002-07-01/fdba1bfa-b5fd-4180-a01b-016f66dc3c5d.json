With the Elland Road board still anticipating an improved offer of around \u00a330m from Manchester United, Ferdinand reiterated his desire to move to Old Trafford at a brief meeting with his chairman Peter Ridsdale, having completed his first pre-season training session. Leeds, for all the public reluctance to sell their captain following what Ridsdale had described as a \"derisory\" bid of \u00a320m last month, expect United to make a more acceptable offer today before Ferdinand is due to depart on an 11-day tour of the Far East and Australia tomorrow morning. \"I had an amicable and constructive meeting with Rio at the training ground,\" said Ridsdale. \"I hope I can soon go back on holiday to rejoin my family in Monaco, depending upon how the next 24 hours pan out.\" While Ridsdale is hoping to raise a British record fee for the player he described as \"the best defender in the world\", members of the club's plc board are believed to be willing to accept nearer \u00a328m provided an immediate downpayment of \u00a320m is made to ease the debts at Elland Road. Their shareholders are hardly keen to have an unsettled Ferdinand prominent in Leeds's touring squad for what is essentially a marketing exercise in China, Australia and Thailand, despite the defender's agent Pinhas Zahavi stressing: \"Rio's under contract and, if nothing happens between the two clubs by then, he will have to go.\" That appears unlikely, with the chairman's admission that he would be prepared to sell his captain to his club's fiercest rivals - \"I do not treat any club different to any other,\" he said - suggesting as much. That willingness was a far cry from his earlier protestations that Ferdinand had a clause in his contract denying him a move to another Premiership club. Indeed, the likelihood appears that United will make their bid today, despite the value of shares in the Old Trafford club falling to their lowest level in six years yesterday. At one stage they fell almost 6% to 112p, compared with the 400p they traded at just over two years ago, amid fears that Sir Alex Ferguson may pay too much for Ferdinand. Leeds will hope negotiations can be concluded more quickly than those aimed at selling Lee Bowyer to Liverpool, with the midfielder's agent David Geiss still talking with Anfield officials and a deal remaining \"close\", according to Geiss. The French midfielder Olivier Dacourt, meanwhile, is likely to remain in Yorkshire having set a deadline of tomorrow for any deals and with Juventus no nearer concluding his \u00a310.5m transfer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
