The result is a thoroughly researched book, bulging with information and tips, covering every section of the holiday market from camping to cruising, with chapters on popular child-friendly destinations. If the information is not in this book's 450 pages, you'll be told where to go to get it. The tips cover everything, from advice on alternatives to vaccination and what toddlers say they want from their holidays to the Civil Aviation Authority's requirements on child travel seats. The travel market has scrambled to produce baby facilities and activities for over-fives and neglected toddlers. However, with this book, you'll be well equipped to enjoy your holiday. (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a310) Take the Kids: London The problem with Joseph Fullman's guide is that it seems to have been written for foreigners, its early chapters listing everything from arriving by plane to addresses of embassies and consulates, with a bit about the climate and even day trips to Brighton thrown in. Perhaps that's why its organisation by region rather than activity makes it a strange read for us Brits - and particularly for Londoners - with its presupposition that visitors will blitz each pocket of London by area. That said, this guide does have some interesting information, such as the fact that kids can camp out at night in the Science Museum, but its pages are curiously smattered with questions and information obviously meant for children - does an adult wanting to take the family to the London Planetarium need a question thrown in to ask the kids: 'Can you name the nine planets that orbit our sun, starting with the nearest?' (Cadogan, \u00a314.99) Birnbaum's Walt Disney World for Kids, by Kids 2002 An interesting idea: a guide book written by children for children. Produced in the style of a colourful scrapbook with lots of pictures and cartoons and edited by Wendy Lefkon, it's a ride-by-ride guide to Disney, with comments from 'real' children on each attraction. Inevitably many of the comments are along the lines of 'this ride is cool', but there are some really useful insider tips too: for example, go on the popular rides during the parades when the queues are shorter, and if you want to see the animators in action, visit on a weekday. It will certainly help whet a child's appetite before the trip and the puzzles and quizzes could kill a dull minute or two while stuck in a queue. However, its success as a guide book on the big day itself will largely depend on whether your kids are the sort who will look up each ride and make a considered decision about whether it's worth the queue, or whether they will be tearing your arms out of the sockets pleading to go on whichever ride happens to be closest. You decide, but whatever you do, follow Alice's advice: 'Don't eat anything right before you go on the teacups!' (Disney Editions, \u00a38.99) The Good Britain Guide 2002, Sixth Edition You probably won't find a more comprehensive guide to family days out in Britain than this. For every county there's an alphabetical listing of interesting towns, villages and family-friendly attractions, as you'd expect. But where this book stands out is with its attention to detail. Alongside the obvious theme parks, zoos and museums, the editor Alistair Aird has highlighted tiny farm parks where children can feed the animals, adventure playgrounds where they can let off steam, even suggestions for good picnic areas and walks - the kind of stuff that can make or break a day out with kids. There are plenty of recommendations for pubs serving food, and useful bed and breakfast listings at the end of each chapter for people planning a longer break. Completely lacking in pictures, this hefty tome may look a bit serious but it does what it says on the cover and you can't say fairer than that.
