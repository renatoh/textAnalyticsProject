Hip cats in Morocco, hungry cats in Greece, fat cats in Italy, frightened cats in China. In Tunis they loll in the dappled shade of a fig tree or tease the resident camel in a seaside cafe. And if you stop in the city's great, sprawling souk for long enough to stroke one, the chances are someone will try to sell it to you. You can buy anything here - from traditional woollen chechia hats to Moorish fridge magnets - and the selling is fast and furious until 7pm, when the shutters start to come down and the good-humoured but urgent voices of the traders - 'Hello! Where you from? Deutsch? Engleesh? Ah! David Beckham' - become a low buzz. In fact, the evening is possibly the best time to stroll around the narrow, winding alleyways, when the maze of little shops is illuminated by a thousand tiny lights. A visit to the medina, the old walled city within a city, is a must for any first-time visitor to Tunis. Designated a United Nations World Heritage Site, it dates from the eighth century; a meandering marketplace encircling the imposing Zitouna mosque and punctuated by ancient landmarks such as Es Slimaniya Medersa - an eighteenth-century Islamic college dedicated by Ali Pasha I to his son, Suleiman, and now, appropriately, home to a traditional medicine foundation. Take a wrong turn and you may end up at an impasse, but with the gate to the medina at the East end, the kasbah due west, and a vague sense that it's uphill from one to the other, it's not difficult to get back on track. The atmosphere is relaxed. Don't want a stuffed camel souvenir from Tunisia? That's your loss. Away from the twisting alleys of tourist tat are a couple of addresses well worth seeking out. One is the hat shop at No 4 Rue Sidi Ben Arous, where friendly Nasser Shawashi sizes you up before selecting a suitably large red chechia with the trademark tassel from his impressive range. The chechia starts off as a giant tea cosy, which is then boiled to within an inch of its life, dyed and scraped into submission with a teasel, before being pummelled into that unmistakable fez shape sported by elderly men and comedians. Prices range from \u00a33 to about a fiver. Round the corner is Ed-Dar, a 400-year-old family home turned into a museum-cum-shop, the most interesting in the medina, selling antique jewellery, carpets and textiles to customers including the British Museum. Manager and artist Ali Chammakhi, whose grandfather started the family business, will show you up the creaky stairs to his roof terrace for one of the best views in Tunis. And with his second, more contemporary branch - the medina's very own Conran Shop - doing a brisk trade in modern ceramics and carved wooden furniture, it's no wonder Chammakhi looks so happy. He's not the only one. Despite the general fall in tourism following the 11 September attacks, the atmosphere in Tunis seems optimistic and upbeat. News comes from the bookshop opposite Ed-Dar that three large houses in the medina are being renovated, shortly to become hotels. Sting is among several famous Europeans that have made Tunis their holiday destination. And since a clean-up for last year's Mediterranean Games, Tunis looks more European than ever - taking the wide, tree-lined Avenue Habib Bourguiba feels like strolling down Las Ramblas in Barcelona. The cool cats don't stay in the city centre: they retreat to the laid-back, chi-chi coastal village of Sidi Bou Said, just 20 minutes away and long admired for its cobbled streets and whitewashed houses with blue-painted doors. Day trippers come and go, a sea of Nikons and sunburnt shoulders that reaches high tide at tea time. Then the streets empty, and the lucky few with a room for the night sip mint tea laced with roasted pine nuts and watch the sun set over the Gulf of Tunis. There's only one place to stay in Sidi Bou Said: Hotel Dar Said. Named one of the 50 top hotels in the world by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller magazine, this former nineteenth- century palace is reached by a discreet side entrance on a road just up from the mosque. Inside, the rooms are tastefully decorated with intricately carved high ceilings, marble floors and antique furniture, all arranged around four pretty courtyards. Outside, there's a little pool and a garden overlooking the bay. The genteel haphazardness of the place only adds to the homely atmosphere: as yet, the hotel cannot change money and the dinner menu is surprisingly meagre. But there's a willingness to please. At first, I do that very British thing of assuming everyone speaks English, reverting later to franglais and a few remembered words of Moroccan slang. Breakfast confuses the hell out of the friendly waiter: 'Good morning,' he says. 'Bonjour,' I reply, absentmindedly. 'Wie gehts?' 'Bikher.' A long, winding stone staircase by the mosque takes you down to Sidi Bou Said's harbour, where million-pound yachts deposit their well-heeled cargo in one of the pleasant cafes. Along the wide, sandy bay young lovers walk hand in hand. There are better beaches at Hammamet and Sousse, not that anyone really comes here just to sunbathe: for Sidi Bou Said is just a couple of train stops away from Carthage. Not much remains of the second greatest city of the Roman empire, but the street names say it all: Rue Hannibal, Rue Plutar que, Rue des Phonecians. And if you stand on Byrsa Hill in front of Carthage museum, you can see what is left of the busy harbour in the distance and, closer by, the homes of the Punics, mostly reduced to rubble when the Romans sacked the city in 146 BC. An engraved plinth points out where the sites used to be. No doubt the residents of modern Carthage occasionally come across a priceless piece of Punic antiquity while digging their gardens. Indeed, a statue of Apollo was discovered intact when foundations were being laid for the museum cafe. Peering down the circular well next to the cafe entrance, you can see it still standing proud at the spot where it was found. Equally impressive are the vast remains of the Roman baths, right on the beach next to the President's palace. A model of the baths in all their former glory gives some idea of the scale of the complex. Nearby is a small graveyard dotted with carved headstones which, according to the Romans, bore witness to the Punics' ritual sacrifice of children. Propaganda, probably - but there's a weird chill about the place and a single poppy growing by the steps down to the sunken tombs seems horribly symbolic. History comes to life in the Bardo museum, west of Tunis city centre, which houses the world's biggest collection of Roman mosaics in a spectacular palace next to the parliament building. Hunting and fishing are popular themes for the mosaic floors, though a faux tiger skin rug and two massive sandalled feet offer light relief. Outside, hawkers steel themselves as the doors open and a group of English tourists spews out. 'Hey, David Beckham!' Then it's cold drinks and fags all round, as some of the group weigh up the relative merits of the postcards and trinkets being touted. I bend down to stroke a cat. I'm told later that one man was offering 'genuine' Punic coins, and somehow I'm not surprised. Maybe he dug them up in his garden. Factfile Debbie Lawson travelled to Tunis with Wigmore Holidays (020 7836 4999), which specialises in holidays to Tunisia. A four-night stay at the Hotel Dar Said in September starts from \u00a3579 per person, including bed and breakfast accommodation, flights and transfers. Entrance to Carthage (all sites) is around \u00a33; to the Bardo Museum is \u00a32. The train between Tunis and Sidi Bou Said, taking in Carthage, costs less than 50p each way, and the taxi fare from Sidi Bou Said to Tunis is about \u00a33. Watch for the hidden extra charge after 9pm. A delicious seafood lunch for two at La Falaise at La Marsa costs \u00a330, including wine; dinner for two at the highly recommended Dar Bel Hadj, a stunning riad-style restaurant in Tunis medina, is \u00a340, including wine and a lift back to the taxi rank in a golf buggy.
