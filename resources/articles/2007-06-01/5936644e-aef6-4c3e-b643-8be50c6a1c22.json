But my research, based on interviews with health policy advisers, suggests that most politicians have only a tenuous grasp of history. They draw on it as a source of cliches to promote policy; but limited use is made of historical interpretation to inform the policy development process. It is not that politicians have failed to mention health service history in recent years so much as they constantly invoke the same narrow history - in particular, the role in the late 1940s of Nye Bevan, the iconic Labour health minister who oversaw the introduction of the NHS. Alan Milburn, health secretary from 1999-2003, was a serial invoker of Bevan. In a speech to the Fabian Society in 2001, he talked of how \"Bevan's shadow hangs over every health secretary, especially Labour ones\". He demolished Bevan's centralised, state-run approach to healthcare but also claimed Bevan would have supported Milburn's decentralised, market- driven NHS model (\"Bevan would not have been afraid of any of these changes.\"). Contribution of all In 2003, Milburn told the Social Market Foundation: \"With the NHS, we all share in the security - Nye Bevan called it the serenity - of knowing that we all pay in when we can do, so that we all can take out when we need to, the health of each of us depending on the contribution of all of us. These were the ideals that inspired the generation of Bevan and Beveridge. They remain our inspiration today.\" John Reid, a subsequent health secretary, argued for foundation hospitals in the early 2000s, partly on the basis that they rejuvenated the tradition of mutualism in British society, which was also associated with Bevan. \"The 1945 Labour government, in going for a policy which equated uniformity with equality, neglected the Labour movement's tradition of cooperation and mutualism. The success of the politics of nationalisation and central government organisation under that government had a severe impact on the development of that tradition. . . Nye Bevan himself spent much of his early trades union time working with miners round compensation and health services ... The central statism of the post-war reforms nearly obliterated this tradition - but not totally.\" There are good reasons for this obsession with Bevan. It is not just because of politicians' lack of knowledge of anything else but also because of the necessary dynamic of policy making. One informant, in an interview, analysed this process vividly: \"I was at a meeting with Paul Corrigan [then a government health adviser] where he was the only person able to articulate what the \u00a350bn more spent on the NHS by 2008 would have achieved. Corrigan said: 'At last the promise of 1948 will have been delivered.' It's like ringing the bell in Mass ... It helped with the narrative, to fit the reforms together, to develop what the narrative was.\" Bevan was inherent to the message of policy; another form of history would not have fitted so easily. And the same was true of the narrative of the Blair government. Tony Blair had the image in the late 1990s, at least among academics, of running a \"history-free\" government, but more recently the political rationale has dictated a changed role for the past. A speech writer commented: \"History started to come in because we were at a particular point in the political cycle ... We wanted to be able to survey what government had done and, beyond that, how things have changed over a longer cycle ... There are trends of which government is part, but not the central player ...\" History thus provides a useful set of precedents for politicians, and it feeds into policy through different routes. My interviews with policy advisers and others showed this happened a variety of ways. Sometimes, politicians just got on with it themselves, drawing on the history they knew from way back. This was a type of politicians' \"folk knowledge\", where politicians and advisers debated the history that was familiar and they knew already. Sometimes, early student experience came in; one keynote speech had been written with the aid of undergraduate notes. Or there might be seminars with outsiders, from which policy discussions and messages were distilled. But one thing stood out: historians per se were rarely involved. Instead, social scientists or economists were invited and spoke on historians' behalf. Does this matter? Politics is essentially a short-term business, and memories in Whitehall are generally short. Civil servants rarely stay in office long and are unlikely to recall health initiatives from previous administrations, or even from the early days of the current one. The reluctance in politics to admit that something has been tried before is also a factor. Politicians now pay much lip service to evidence-based policy making. Arguably, they could involve history and its debates and interpretations more fully in the process of policy development. The invocation of Bevan would benefit from discussion of the system which he displaced through his nationalisation of the hospitals. The powerhouse of health services until 1948 was in local government. The medical officer of health - the local public health official - controlled an \"empire\" of health and social services that provided the integration between health and social care, which politicians have struggled since the 1970s to attain through other routes. Public involvement in health issues - another current concern - came through local democratic processes, rather than through the quangos with which the processes have since been replaced. Bevan's achievement was great in the short-term politics of the 1940s, but there were also losses that we might well consider. Avenues for discussion Historians would not argue that these systems can necessarily be replicated in the present, but acknowledgement that they existed does open up avenues for discussion. An awareness of the history of NHS reorganisation since 1948, for example, might well have caused later administrations to pause before forging ahead with yet another reorganisation. Politicians are narrowing their options by only invoking the same old history, or they are not invoking history at all. Who would know, from the recent discussion of the MMR vaccination, that there has been a long tradition of public opposition to vaccination, going right back into the 19th century? Academic historians used only to speak to each other, but in recent years there has been a sea change in attitude and they have begun to reach out to the public through campaigns such as History Matters and History and the Public. They have also begun to address the policy significance of their work through the History and Policy website. Isn't it time that politicians began to draw on this evidence too - in the interests of the mature public debate on health issues they say they want? \u00b7 Virginia Berridge is director of the Centre for History in Public Health, London School of Tropical Hygiene.
