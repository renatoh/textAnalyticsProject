Undeterred, Dewage simply moved to the car park and became a one-man party, playing CDs from his car stereo and in the process recruiting enough musicians to form the band. Soon they were taking their show on the road, driving to more welcoming venues in Sydney and Adelaide. By 2008, thanks the recognition and support of the Sri Lankan Cricket Board and players like Sanath Jayasuriya, they\u2019d even found their way inside the MCG. \u201cI think that the organisers saw that we were a crowd attraction,\u201d says Dewage. Since then they\u2019ve been central to the carnival atmosphere of Sri Lanka\u2019s tours of Australia, making them feel like home games. Backing also came from Cricket Australia and for the current tournament the ICC has provided the band with tickets for all of Sri Lanka\u2019s fixtures. \u201cThey marketed us as the official icons of Sri Lankan fans,\u201d says Dewage. As their appeal has grown, the Papare Band have also brought their joyous energy to Cricket Victoria\u2019s Harmony in Cricket matches, Big Bash League fixtures and even scored an A-League gig for Melbourne City. I speak to Dewage the morning after Sri Lanka\u2019s disappointing quarter-final loss to South Africa and though deflated by the result he says that he and his colleagues - cricket fans foremost - will all attend the Melbourne final regardless. \u201cWhatever is on in Melbourne we try to go.\u201d If ever it was in doubt, the antipodean installment of the World Cup has served as a reminder to Cricket Australia that the support base of Asian expats is a fanatical one. The cacophonous support for India at their Melbourne pool match against South Africa left even veteran MCG attendees awestruck. Outnumbered but not outdone, Bangladesh\u2019s local fans have made enough noise for the rest of the country combined; this at a time when one-day international cricket so often fails to rouse Australian crowds. \u201cCricket Australia and the ICC see the potential,\u201d notes Dewage, \u201cnow it\u2019s all about entertainment.\u201d He believes that in embracing the match-day traditions of Asian nations CA has also allowed for healthy competition between the supporter groups, enhancing the live experience for everyone. Before Thursday\u2019s quarter final between India and Bangladesh even starts, both India\u2019s Swami Army and large groups of Bangladesh fans congregate outside the MCG, beating drums, singing and chanting right up until they reach the gates in front of the Members stand. There, a giant Bangladesh flag is unfurled and carried around by boisterous and excited supporters. Among those Bangladeshis is a man known simply as \u2018Milon\u2019, now one of the most recognisable figures of the World Cup on account of his bright yellow Tiger-print face paint. The Bangladesh fans rallying around him as he waves his national flag say he doesn\u2019t speak a word of English but he\u2019s both cult hero and unofficial team mascot on account of his dedication to the cause. Milon has travelled to each of Bangladesh\u2019s World Cup fixtures on his own dime. He also applies all of the paint himself, they say. At one stage in the Bangladesh reply, the big screens at the MCG exult him as \u201cTiger Man!\u201d to the somewhat incongruous musical accompaniment of Katy Perry\u2019s \u2018Roar\u2019. Still, even the Swami Army cheer this event like a Virat Kohli boundary. Right in the middle of the most vocal group of Bangladesh supporters I meet Naiful Islam, who has lived in Melbourne for three years. Owing to the infrequency of their visits to Australian shores, this is the first time he\u2019s been able to follow the Tigers around and watch them live in Australia. \u201cWe are following Bangladesh everywhere in this tournament,\u201d he says as he alternates between a bass drum and a tambourine, \u201call the way from Adelaide, through New Zealand and now here in Melbourne.\u201d Kitted out in team colours like all of the supporters around him, Naiful is still bubbling with excitement that the tournament made it down under. \u201cWherever Bangladesh go, we want to be there,\u201d he says. When I speak to him in the innings break he promises that he\u2019s got at least another five hours of enthusiastic drumming left in him. The coordination of the Bangladesh supporter group \u2013 who on a number of occasions throughout the day joke with Indian fans and engage them in drum battles - is a little more ad-hoc than others. Most of the wrangling happened through a Bangladesh community Facebook page, from which the word was spread pre-tournament to make section M34 Bangladesh territory. As the night wears on and the Tigers\u2019 fortunes sag, not only does the noise and enthusiasm among Naiful and his cohorts fail to dissipate, it actually becomes louder. \u201cIt\u2019s not just cricket for us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is something else.\u201d On nights like this one \u2013 with a half-filled stadium maintaining fever pitch for hours on end \u2013 you can see exactly what he means."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
