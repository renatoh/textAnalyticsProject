Jones usually prefers to warm up for a Test against England by slagging them off but even he now believes Clive Woodward's squad are currently the finest team around. \"It is our biggest challenge of the year and we are playing the best team in the world,\" Jones said. \"You don't get much bigger than that, do you?\" No one knows better than an Australian what it takes to win a Test on Kiwi soil. The Wallabies have lost on 11 of their last 15 Test visits. Jones, having studied the video closely, was impressed and says England will pose his injury-weakened side serious questions on Saturday under the closed roof of the Docklands Stadium. \"Everyone's talking about how England have never won in Australia, but what we're seeing out here is the best-prepared England side ever,\" he insisted. \"Their game is based on a variety of tactics to suit different conditions.\" Even Jones appears to have conceded there are few sides to match England in the dark art of mauling and their current forwards have done nothing to dent the argument that Super 12 breeds a looser type of forward less suited to the harsh environment of Test rugby. \"The advantage they have is that, week in week out at home, they play a confrontational game. Their domestic games are real gain-line and set-piece battles which we tend to play away from. When we lost 21-15 at Twickenham in 2001, England gave us a bit of a lesson in the forwards, they mauled us to death. \"England were very impressive and tactically very smart on Saturday. They didn't give New Zealand much free ball, their set-piece work was outstanding, their contest at the tackle was very good and Johnson's captaincy was terrific. He's a guy who leads by example and he had very good communications skills with the referee.\" Only the final line was typically mischievous Jones but the coach was otherwise the model of restraint. He responded sharply - \"don't put that in my mouth\" - when invited to describe England's forwards as \"past it\" rather than \"mature\" but he did leave the door ajar for some verbal sparring this week. \"I'm sure we're going to have some fun somewhere down the line.\" Both coaches favour playing indoors - \"under a nice closed roof and a hard, fast pitch,\" said Jones - and neither does he share the wide Kiwi view that England are one-dimensional. \"No, I don't think they are. England have a set way but you can see touches of unpredictability have come into their game,\" said Jones. \"Josh Lewsey has added another dimension at full-back, given them a lot more thrust in the back three.\" Elton Flatley, dropped for the England game after missing the Sunday morning session following the win over Wales, has apologised but will not be reprieved. Nathan Grey will probably replace him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
