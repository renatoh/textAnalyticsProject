Many are considering voting Tory for the first time. As someone raised in a northern working-class town and whose dad was white and working-class, I understand the frustrations that led to Brexit (if my dad was still alive he may well have voted leave), and why so many people want the referendum result to be swiftly enforced. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve read a lot of articles where remainers talk to remainers and leavers to leavers. So let me reach out, respectfully, from a remainer to a leaver, and ask that you think twice about casting your vote for the Conservatives. 1. \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Really? It\u2019s a comforting thought that, after this Christmas election, Britain will have left the European Union within weeks. But what kind of nation will we be after that? Division will run deep in our society, with the 48% (16 million) remain voters believing the Boris Johnson Brexit is very different to that promised back in 2016: out of the single market, out of the customs union, and a border down the Irish sea. None of this was on the side of the bus. And that\u2019s not even to mention the fact the Brexit isn\u2019t even \u201cdone\u201d till a trade agreement is reached, which will likely take years. No deal could well be back on the table in a year\u2019s time. 2. Brexit is for life \u2026 Yes, the years of negotiation have been agonising. But there are two main reasons for this: first, Theresa May drew up contradictory red lines that required a hard border in Ireland. And second, leaving the EU after more than 40 years was always going to be a complex process. Think of it like buying a home: if the property survey shows up unforeseen problems, the answer is to resolve them first, rather than press ahead for a move on an arbitrary date regardless of the consequences. From chlorinated chicken to medical supplies, to ferry companies with no ships, there has been no shortage of unforeseen problems. It\u2019s not surprising there have been delays. Though a swift end seems appealing, remember: Brexit is for life, not just for Christmas. 3. The Tories have a record for cheap slogans. Only two years ago Theresa May went into the election saying: \u201cI\u2019ll deliver Brexit.\u201d How did that go? Before that, David Cameron pledged to eradicate the deficit and to slash immigration. Both targets are now scrapped. Johnson has said: \u201cWe\u2019ll leave Europe on 31 October, no ifs or buts.\u201d He said he\u2019d rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d. Slogans are simple \u2013 reality is a lot more difficult. 4. Johnson despises people like you. In a Spectator article he wrote that working-class men are \u201clikely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless\u201d. Johnson is not your friend, your ally, or someone who\u2019s looking out for you. In the same article he attacked single mothers and their \u201cill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u201d children. When challenged, he says dismissively: \u201cI\u2019ve written millions of words.\u201d But those words had the clear aim of holding up the working-class and single mothers to ridicule and moral condemnation in a magazine catering for the rich and powerful. 5. Johnson picks on the weak. His attacks on black people (\u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d, \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d), Muslims (niqab wearers look like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbankrobbers\u201d) and gay people (\u201cbumboys\u201d) are now well known. Last week another quote emerged. \u201cIslamophobia \u2013 fear of Islam \u2013 seems a natural reaction,\u201d he wrote, again in the Spectator. \u201cJudged purely on its scripture \u2013 to say nothing of what is preached in the mosques \u2013 it is the most viciously sectarian of all religions in its heartlessness towards unbelievers.\u201d If there\u2019s one consistent theme to Johnson\u2019s writing, it\u2019s that he picks on the weak, those who don\u2019t have a media platform to answer back. 6. In contrast, Corbyn always fights for the underdog. While Johnson was smashing up restaurants with his Bullingdon mates knowing he\u2019d never have to worry about the law, Jeremy Corbyn was campaigning to make life better for ordinary working people of all backgrounds. For a fair tax system in which the rich pay their share; against factory and pit closures; and against the sell-off of Britain\u2019s national assets. And he went further: he spoke out for the rights of black people and ethnic minorities facing discrimination and harassment; for women\u2019s rights; for gay rights; and for dialogue with Northern Ireland\u2019s republicans. All of these, at the time, were unpopular causes and were pilloried in the press as \u201cloony left\u201d. Yet all, today, are accepted as mainstream \u2013 some even lauded as a sign of \u201cBritish values\u201d. 7. Labour and antisemitism. Corbyn\u2019s critics are right to say the party should have handled its complaints better and faster. But paradoxically, what\u2019s given antisemitism such a high media profile over the past couple of years (compared to Tory party Islamophobia, which is widespread but barely receives any coverage), is that fact that Labour members care so much about it and will not stop until it is driven out of the party. 8. How to unite the country. If Britain is to leave Europe then let it at least be done in a way the nation can unite behind. We now know far more about what it really means than we did in June 2016. If it really is still the will of the people, there should be no problem in getting another majority for it. But this time, it would be on the basis of a clear outcome that has been negotiated in advance. A Corbyn-negotiated Brexit (the basics of which have already, in principle, been met warmly by EU leaders) would protect jobs, protect trade, and protect workers\u2019 rights. Johnson\u2019s deal does none of those things. Remainers would still regret a vote for Brexit, but would abide by it and move on. The Tories call this \u201cdithering\u201d. Yet they\u2019ve bungled Brexit for three and a half years, and we\u2019ve still not left the EU. Corbyn could resolve this Tory-created crisis within six months. 9. Remember why you\u2019ve always voted Labour. If Britain leaves with Johnson\u2019s deal on 31 January there\u2019ll certainly be a strong sense of relief. But it will be short-lived. Because then we\u2019ll face five more years of Conservative government, and let\u2019s not forget what that means: more cuts (the Tories say they\u2019ll protect the NHS and the police but almost everything else will likely be slashed back); more job insecurity; more homelessness; more demand for foodbanks; fewer local services; no plan for social care; tax cuts for the richest; and no investment in the green economy of the future. If Johnson\u2019s elected, we\u2019ll be back in a harsh, Tory Britain. Don\u2019t forget what that feels like. 10. A question of character. Who do you trust? One of the candidates for prime minister has a decades-long track record of campaigning for those the powerful don\u2019t care about: working people, sick and disabled people, minorities, and the weakest and most marginalised. The other has a decades-long record of looking out for himself, vilifying the vulnerable, lying and cheating. He won\u2019t even say how many kids he has. If you think the second of these is the man who can unite Britain and lead us into a brighter future then, once more, I respectfully urge you: please think again. \u2022 Joseph Harker is the Guardian\u2019s deputy Opinion editor.
