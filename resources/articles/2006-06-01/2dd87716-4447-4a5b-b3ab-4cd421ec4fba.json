The sight of him diving in a muddy goalmouth, goading David Beckham to try to beat him from the penalty spot, even brought a schoolmasterly admonishment from a protective Sven-Goran Eriksson yesterday. \"I thought he was going to injure himself,\" the England head coach reported. \"He wanted to show what a good goalkeeper he was but I wouldn't let him.\" The same training session, at Cologne's RheinEnergieStadion, had also seen a grinning Rooney slithering along the rain-soaked turf, like a human cannonball, to try to tackle Jermaine Jenas with his head in a game of piggy-in-the-middle. It was a challenge that the Manchester United striker won. \"He's tackling anything that moves,\" sighed the paternal Eriksson. \"Nothing surprises me about Wayne. Nothing.\" Tonight, in a team that has been crying out for some invention, Rooney will revert to the more orthodox assignment of living up to his billing of the most creative English footballer since Paul Gascoigne. Eriksson, exercising his customary caution, is warning against the temptation to believe the 20-year-old can flick a switch and single-handedly wipe out the long inventory of faults that have accompanied their opening two matches but his plea was followed by an admission that even this notoriously unflappable Swede is smouldering with a sense of excitement. \"It's so important for us that he's back,\" Eriksson volunteered. \"Every player in the squad, every England fan, every football supporter who is here has been waiting for this moment. It doesn't matter if you support Chelsea, Tottenham, Everton -even Manchester City - everyone wants to see Wayne Rooney in a World Cup.\" Everyone, that is, apart from opposition defences. The man Manchester United supporters call the \"white Pele\" has the reputation that goes before him these days and there was some machiavellian thinking behind Erik- sson's decision to name Rooney in the team in advance. \"I did it deliberately because what I know for sure is that they [Sweden] wouldn't have wanted to hear that Rooney is starting,\" said Eriksson. \"Scared isn't the right word, but they will be worried, that's for certain. Rooney can do so many things. I don't think anyone in this World Cup would want to meet him, even if he is coming back from injury. \"He's very close to what he can do when he's at his best. He's on fire out there [in training] and he's getting better and better all the time. I don't think we should expect to see him at 100% but he will be better than he was [against Trinidad &amp; Tobago].\" There is natural sympathy for Peter Crouch that six goals in five games have been insufficient to retain his place but there can be little doubt that Rooney's return to fitness has invigorated the entire squad. \"It's not the same having Crouch on the pitch as having Rooney,\" said Eriksson. \"We know it. The whole football world knows it.\" Uppermost in his thoughts is the effect it could have on Michael Owen and, principally, the improvement in terms of the team's passing in and around the penalty area. Owen has complained more than once that he is still waiting for a decent through-ball, although Eriksson's expression when that was put to him suggested that he believes the Newcastle United striker has a handily selective memory. \"Right or not right?\" he mused. \"I have heard that for 30 years from strikers who don't score. It's always the way. Statistically though, I can agree that when Crouch is on the pitch we do play more long balls. It's 50% long, 50% short. With Rooney playing instead of Crouch, I suppose we will play more short balls and it will be easier for Owen.\" Where all this leaves Theo Walcott it is difficult to gauge but if he remains unused for a third successive match it will be widely construed as an admission from Eriksson that this 17-year-old with the provisional driver's licence and the girlfriend from Claire's Accessories may not be up to the grade. Walcott has fleetingly impressed in training with his exhilarating pace but it is Aaron Lennon who has had the senior players cooing in admiration. \"It's possible,\" Eriksson replied when asked whether Walcott would be brought on. \"I'd like to see him but I can't say for sure. You cannot plan like that with your substitutes until the match is under way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
