In recent years their championship challenge has disintegrated before the decorations come down, but the players will be able to enjoy their Christmas lunch on Saturday with a five-point lead over Arsenal. Norwich were the latest team to attempt to stop Chelsea's irrepressible rhythm only to become the sixth club in the past two months to concede four goals. What was more worrying for the rest of the Premiership was that Chelsea did not even come close to playing at their best, but still they were three goals up before Mike Dean mercifully blew for half-time. At the heart of much of what Chelsea did, as so often when they play well, was Frank Lampard. He took control of the match after 10 minutes, when Thomas Helveg unforgivably passed the ball straight to Damien Duff for the Irishman to score his seventh goal of the season. Lampard had already tried his luck from long range with a fierce left-footed shot before he effectively ended the game as a contest. Again Norwich gave the ball away - this time Gary Doherty was the guilty party - but it took a stunning curling 25-yard shot to punish them and to beat the helpless Robert Green. The England midfielder then played a key role in the goal of the game, which came a minute before half-time. Lampard scooped Arjen Robben's pass back to Tiago, who flicked it into the charging Dutchman's path before he struck emphatically home. Lampard's rise to prominence since the previous Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri paid \u00a311m to West Ham for his services in 2001 has been remarkable, but he has already been a part of a few false dawns at Stamford Bridge. Ranieri, who also gave the equally impressive John Terry his chance of first-team football, was rewarded for a second-place finish last season with the sack. Lampard has a great affection for Ranieri, but he knows it is Jose Mourinho who is responsible for Chelsea's current assault on the title. \"We believe in ourselves and have confidence in ourselves,\" Lampard said. \"There is a different attitude to last year and that's down to the manager. I'm not saying the previous manager was a bad manager but this one keeps reminding us we have to win everything. \"He is meticulous in everything he does by preparing dossiers on every team so we know exactly what to do. All the pressure comes from the outside. We have got young hungry players who want to win things. We think that will overcome our lack or experience and take us all the way.\" Norwich had battled hard for the opening 45 minutes but were guilty of making the kind of mistakes that sees teams relegated. If that were not bad enough, Mourinho brought on \u00a340m of talent from the substitutes' bench after the break in Didier Drogba, Scott Parker and Mateja Kezman. There was still no room in the squad for the likes of Joe Cole, Geremi and Alexei Smertin and, with the transfer window looming, one might think some players could be feeling the chill. But Lampard insists Chelsea's rivals will have a very long wait if they are searching for any tangible signs of discord. \"There is not really a problem with the players who aren't playing,\" he said. \"If you saw how the dressing room was before and after the game you would have seen the spirit throughout the team. \"Everyone thinks they will get a chance. Scott Parker and Mateja Kezman came in and the others will at some point.\" The trio who came on made their point in the short time they were given and ensured that complacency did not become a problem for the home side. Green was forced into making fine saves from Lampard and Robben before the rout was completed late on. Chelsea's first three goals all had a touch of finesse but they proved they can do the basics as well as Drogba powered home a majestic header from Duff's well-taken corner. Man of the match: Frank Lampard - At the heart of all of Chelsea's best moves and he scored one of those goals that brings a crowd to its feet. Best moment: The charging run into the box, neat turn on the ball and clever pass to set up the third goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
