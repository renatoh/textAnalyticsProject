Life insurer Friends Provident's shares will be priced at the low end of expectations - at 225p - when it floats on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, it said today. The pricing will mean members' windfalls will be worth between \u00a3450 and around \u00a311,000 depending on the size of their allocation, Friends said. The group's 1.7m members have each been given 200 free shares, with some members getting additional allocations depending on the size of their policy and how long they have held it. Merrill Lynch, the investment bank advising the group, had set an indicative range of between 210p to 270p for the society's shares. But turbulent stock markets, and a warning from Friends Provident that profits for the year are likely to be down, led analysts to predict they would be priced at the lower end of the range. At the 225p price, Friends will be valued at \u00a33.7bn on flotation. Chief executive Keith Satchell said: \"This is an historic day for Friends Provident. We are very pleased with the interest that institutional investors in the UK and internationally have shown in Friends Provident. \"We are also delighted with the level of applications we have received from our members and customers which we are pleased to meet in full. We welcome institutional investors together with our members and customers as shareholders in Friends Provident plc. \"We are totally committed to delivering shareholder value and we look forward to our future as a listed company with great confidence.\" Jennie Campbell at stockbroker Gerrard said: \"Obviously it is at the low end of expectations. I had expected between 230p and 235p.\" She said it was difficult to say how the firm would fare on its first day of trading, given the current market conditions. \"It is not a very good time to float,\" she added. Looking long term, the firm could be seen as a takeover target. \"If it doesn't succeed it will be taken over. People are going to be looking at it and seeing how it does, but the bottom line is if it doesn't make it, it will probably be taken over.\" A spokesperson from Merrill Lynch said: \"We think it's a good price given the current equity markets. It is within the range we set a month ago.\" She said the response from institutional investors had been good, while the response from policyholders had been above expectations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
