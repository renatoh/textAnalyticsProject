Analysis by Heriot-Watt University for Crisis has found that the number of homeless people in Britain will reach 575,000, up from 236,000 in 2016. The number of people sleeping rough will more than quadruple from 9,100 in 2016 to 40,100 over the same period, the research found. The forecast, released to mark the 50th anniversary of Crisis, comes as the number of homeless households has jumped by a third in the past five years. The majority of those affected are \u201csofa surfers\u201d, with 68,300 people sleeping on other people\u2019s couches. The biggest rise will be for those placed by a council in unsuitable accommodation, such as bed and breakfasts, with the total expected to rise from 19,300 to 117,500. Crisis has urged the government to build more affordable housing and launch a concerted effort to tackle rough sleeping. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: \u201cWith the right support at the right time, it doesn\u2019t need to be inevitable ... Together we can find the answers and make sure those in power listen to them.\u201d Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, said that homelessness had become the bulk of her workload. \u201cThe government needs to wake up ... The system is broken. Without more social housing, a flood of good temporary accommodation and investment in homelessness support the problem will get worse.\u201d Jim McMahon, Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton, said: \u201cThis is a crisis of the government\u2019s own making. Deliberate and targeted policies and cuts in welfare, housing and community support have made a bad situation terrible.\u201d Jacqui McCluskey, director of policy and communications at the charity Homeless Link, said the predictions were extremely concerning. \u201cIt is unacceptable that anyone should have no other option than to sleep on the streets or live in poor-quality temporary accommodation, and we must continue to act to ensure the current situation not only improves but definitely does not worsen. The report found that the problems will be more acute in England compared with Scotland, with London particularly affected. The capital is forecast to account for more than half of England\u2019s homeless population by 2041. Rosena Allin-Khan, Labour MP for Tooting, said: \u201cThe mayor of London is tackling the housing crisis, securing record investment. We must now ensure councils across London are given the powers to get building \u2013 and are held to account if they fail to do so. \u201cHomelessness in the UK in 2017 should not be an inevitability and it should be the responsibility of all in government to ensure that it is not.\u201d The Crisis report said that a 60% increase in new housing could reduce levels of homelessness by 19% by 2036, while increased prevention work could reduce levels by 34% in the same period. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said homelessness was a national scandal. \u201cThis is a direct result of decisions made by Conservative ministers: a steep drop in investment for affordable homes, crude cuts to housing benefit, reduced funding for homelessness services and a refusal to help private renters,\u201d he said. Crisis is calling on the public to support its Everybody In campaign to end the worst forms of homelessness. Sparkes said: \u201cNow is the time for action and long-term planning to end homelessness for good.\u201d The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said: \u201cThis government is determined to help the most vulnerable in society and we\u2019re working to make sure people always have a roof over their head. We know this is an issue government can\u2019t solve alone and so welcome Crisis\u2019s support for our commitment to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping. \u201cAlongside investing \u00a3550m to 2020 to address the issue, we\u2019re implementing the Homelessness Reduction Act, which will require councils to provide early support to people at risk of becoming homeless.\u201d The act is due to come into effect next year. It includes funding of \u00a361m for 2017-18 and 2018-19. The DCLG said it is considering further funding for high-pressure areas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
