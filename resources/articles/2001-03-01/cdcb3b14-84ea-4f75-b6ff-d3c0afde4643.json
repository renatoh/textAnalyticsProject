He will propose that as a condition of benefit, the illiterate unemployed or claimants on the new deal be required to go on basic read ing and writing courses. Those who took intensive courses of up to three months would receive about \u00a310 extra in benefits. But some claimants might lose benefit if they refused. Mr Blair and David Blunkett, the education secretary, will promote a \u00a31.5bn programme over three years following the government report, A Fresh Start, written by Sir Claus Moser two years ago. It has been estimated that Britain's low skills base costs the economy \u00a311bn a year. Since then the government has set up the learning and skills council, replacing the training and enterprise councils. Bryan Sanderson, the chairman of Sunderland football club and executive director of BP Amoco, is chairing the council. Ministers claim he is so concerned by levels of adult illiteracy that he is trying to improve the quality of the Sunderland football programme, as it is probably one of the few pieces of printed material that fans read each week. Pilot projects will require early basic skills screening of claimants on job seekers allowance, as well as anyone on the voluntary new deal for lone parents or for the older unemployed. Screening will take place after six months on the programme. Ministers are also examining family literacy programmes, in which parents and their children learn together; tailor-made strategies for targeting resources on disadvantaged areas; and more opportunities for basic skills training in the workplace. Government estimates suggest that on average an employed person could earn an extra \u00a31,000 a year with improved numeracy skills. Ministers want to make the materials used for improving basic adult skills more relevant to everyday situations. Illiterate and innumerate adults are less likely to vote or own their own home, and more prone to physical and mental health problems. The government is already committed to doubling the numbers taking part in basic literacy and numeracy programmes to 500,000 by 2002. Ministers have also set a target to reduce the number of adults who have difficulty with literacy or numeracy by 750,000 by 2004. Research published yesterday by the office of national statistics showed that 14.9% of adults of working age in England - 4.8m - have no qualifications. Ministers have also encouraged trade unions to appoint learning representatives, as they already appoint health and safety representatves. Ministers have already announced an increase in spending on adult skills from \u00a3241m this financial year to \u00a3403m in 2003-4. Research by the National Foundation for Education Research shows adults involved in family learning have higher attendance, retention and completion rates than adults on courses and their progression to further study or employment is high. The research also showed little is known about basic skills teaching on the ground. National surveys of adults' attainment in literacy and numeracy show that about 20% have less than functional literacy, and about 20% have poor numeracy. At the launch in Downing Street today, the TUC general secretary, John Monks, will say that the number of adults lacking basic literacy and numeracy \"is nothing short of a national disaster, a strain on our economy and a blight on individual lives\". He will urge companies to do more for workers who struggle to read and write."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
