FTSE4Good is a set of new socially responsible indices from FTSE, the global index group. The indices are designed to establish a measure of the companies classed as socially responsible for those wishing to invest in such companies. Why was the FTSE4Good series set up? The FTSE4Good index series was set up to cater for a growing number of investors who want access to a list of recognised companies involved in socially responsible investment (SRI). Can I invest now? No, you can view the companies selected for inclusion at FTSE4Good, but the series will not go live until the July 31, 2001. How does a company qualify? The key areas of focus of this new index series include the environment, human rights and stakeholder relations. Stakeholder relations means the extent to which a company demonstrates a concern about its relations with the people with a stake in the business. To qualify, a company must adopt an equal opportunities policy and/or include a commitment to equal opportunities or diversity in their annual report or website. The company's impact on the environment is judged by the FTSE4Good advisory committee and is assessed against a best practice framework. On the issue of human rights, only high-impact companies - companies with the greatest responsibility for the maintenance of human rights - are included in the index series. These have been identified as those operating in businesses of strategic importance in countries with the poorest human rights records. What are the exclusions? The FTSE4Good series excludes tobacco producers, manufacturers of weapon systems, and owners or operators of nuclear power stations and those mining or processing uranium. How are companies elected for the new index series? Information on the selected companies is based on research and analysis conducted by the independent body, Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS). The FTSE4Good advisory committee looks at the information and selects eligible stocks from the existing FTSE indices. These existing indices are the FTSE ALL-Share in the UK and the FTSE Developed Index for overseas. Is it just investors who benefit from the new index series? No, children's charity Unicef, will receive a 40% share of the fees generated by the indices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
