Here\u2019s a summary of what he said: Obama said evidence that Russia had sought to hack the election on behalf of Donald Trump was convincing but he would not weigh in on whether Russian hacking actually swayed the election. Obama said there was no malfeasance in how the election was counted: \u201cthe votes that were cast were counted, they were counted appropriately.\u201d Obama defended his response \u2013 or lack of response \u2013 to Russian hacking before the election, saying that the hacking stopped after he told president Vladimir Putin to stop and that he did not want to undermine the integrity of the election, which Donald Trump was attacking, or to appear partisan. Obama said that the United States was made vulnerable to attacks by Russia or other foreign countries by its divided politics. Obama went easy on Trump in general, saying that the president-elect was \u201cstill in transition mode.\u201d Obama said Syrian president Bashar Assad, Russia and Iran have \u201cblood on their hands\u201d for the slaughter of Aleppo. He said tens of thousands of innocent people were trapped in the city and should be allowed to leave. Obama defended his Syria policy, saying he wasn\u2019t willing to deploy a large American military ground force and \u201cunless we were all in... we were going to have problems. Obama criticized Republicans for a poll that showed better than a third of them supported Vladimir Putin. \u201cRonald Reagan would roll over in his grave,\u201d Obama said. Obama said he had last spoken to Trump a few days ago in a \u201ccordial\u201d conversation. Obama said he gave Trump \u201cspecific suggestions about... maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions.\u201d Obama said the country was better off than it was eight years ago. \u201cMele Kalikimaka\u201d Obama concluded, which in Hawaii means Merry Christmas. Obama says that at the end of his last holiday photo line he took a photo with his Marine corps band. He got choked up, he says. \u201cBut it was just one small example of all the people who have contributed to our success. I\u2019m responsible for where we screwed up. All the successes are shared... On his way out, Obama is asked whether it was his last news conference. He said he\u2019ll see. Mele Kalikimaka, Obama says. Merry Christmas, in Hawaii. Trump had promised we\u2019d start saying Merry Christmas again and here we\u2019re saying Mele Kalikimaka. Obama makes fun of fake news that says Michelle Obama\u2019s eating initiative is \u201ca greater threat to democracy than our government going after the press if they\u2019re issuing a story that they don\u2019t like. People have asked me how do you feel after the election, and i say look, this is a clarifying moment, it\u2019s a useful reminder that voting counts, politics counts.. I think people will be able to compare and contrast and make judgments about what works for the American people.\u201d Obama says he hopes that Trump\u2019s plan works. He says his plan worked. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue that we\u2019re not better off. We are. And for that I thank the American people...\u201d Obama refuses a question about the electors. It\u2019s their job to pick a successor, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve provided people with a lot of information about what happened during the course of the election, but more importantly the candidates themselves talked about their beliefs... the president elect, I think, has been very explicit about what he cares about, what he believes in. The electoral college is a vestige, it\u2019s a carryover from an earlier vision of how our federal government was going to work that put a lot of premium on states... it\u2019s the same type of thinking that gives Wyoming 2 senators with a half million people... there are some structures in our political system.. that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats, but the truth of the matter is if we have a strong message,.... typically the popular vote and the electoral college vote will align... If we look for one explanation or one silver bullet or one easy fix for our politics then we\u2019re probably going to be disappointed. There are just a lot of factors... that has made both politics and governance more challenging... I do hope that we all just take some time, take a breath,... to just reflect a little bit more about how can we get to a place where people are focused on working together based on at least some common set of facts. Question for Obama: should current labor secretary Tom Perez run the DNC? Obama praises Perez, calling him one of the best labor secretaries in history, \u201ctireless\u201d and \u201cwicked smart.\u201d \u201cIf you look at his body of work on behalf of working people, what he\u2019s pushed for... he has been extraordinary. Now others who have declared are also my friends and are fine people as well. And the great thing is, I don\u2019t have a vote in this. I\u2019ve described to you earlier what I think needs to happen. Which is that the Democratic party... has to work at the grassroots level, has to be present in all 50 states... has to think about message... \u201cI will say this. I could not be prouder of the coalition that I put together in each of my campaigns. Because it was inclusive and it drew in people who normally weren\u2019t interested in politics... I always cast a broad net... there\u2019s more that we share than divides us, and I want to talk to everybody and get a chance to get everybody\u2019s vote. .. outside of the realm of electoral politics, I still see people the way I saw them when I made that speech. Full of contradictions... but basically folks care about their families, they care about having meaningful work, making sure their ckids have more opportunity than they did. They want to be safe, they want to make sure things are fair... \u201cWhat I was able during my campaigns, I was not able to do during midterms. .. the coalition... didn\u2019t always turn out to be transferrable.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement! Next question is about Trump\u2019s conversation with the Taiwanese president and challenge to the One China policy. What\u2019s Obama think of a \u201cfresh\u201d China policy? Great question, he says. \u201cI\u2019m somewhere in between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes. I am very proud of the work I\u2019ve done. I think I\u2019m a better president than when I started [but] democracy benefits from some new perspectives. \u201cGiven the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, given how much is at stake... there\u2019s probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance, and where there\u2019s also the potential if that relationship breaks down... that everybody is worse off. I think it\u2019s fine for him to take a look at it. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve advised is across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you\u2019re doing at in a systematic intentional way... before he starts to have a lot of interaction with foreign governments...that he should want to have his full team in place... so that as he\u2019s then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, he\u2019s got all the information to make good decisions. \u201cWith respect to China, and let\u2019s just take the example of Taiwan, there has been a longstanding agreement between China, the US and to some degree the Taiwanese, which is not to change the status quo.\u201d Obama is asked whether Putin personally directed the hacking. He says wait for the intelligence report. But he has \u201cgreat confidence in their assessment that the Russians carried out this hack. The hack of the DNC and the hack of John Podesta. But again, this is why I want the report out, so that everybody can review it.\u201d Obama says Congress has seen the reports \u201cand I think that what you\u2019ve already seen is the folks that have seen the evidence don\u2019t dispute that it was the Russians who have carried it out.\u201d Obama says the larger point is, \u201cnot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. This is pretty hierarchical operation. Last I checked, there\u2019s not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation.. this happened at the highest levels of the Russian government and I will let you ... whether there are high-level Russian officials going rogue.\u201d \u201cMartha I\u2019ve given you what I\u2019m going to give you. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I think that the president elect is still in transition mode, from campaign to governance... he still has campaign spokesman sort of filling in and appearing on cable shows. There\u2019s just a whole different attitude and vibe when you\u2019re not in power as when you\u2019re in power. How will the president-elect operate and how will his team operate when they\u2019ve been fully briefed?\u201d \u201cThe more this [hacking story] can be nonpartisan, the better-served the American people are going to be. I\u2019m going to keep on repeating this point. Our vulnerability... is directly related to how divided, partisan, dysfunctional our political process is. That\u2019s the thing that makes us vulnerable. If fake news is being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it\u2019s not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect, because it doesn\u2019t seem so far-fetched.\u201d Obama warns about \u201cdomestic propagandists.\u201d Question for Obama: Can you assure the public this was a free and fair election? Will you declassify some of the evidence on Russian hacking? Are you concerned about the Tillerson pick and some of Trump\u2019s closeness to Putin? Obama: I\u2019m getting older. These multi-part questions... \u201cI can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was a concern and will continue to be a concern. That the votes that were cast were counted, they were counted appropriately. We have not seen evidence of machines being tampered with. That assurance I can provide. We paid a lot of attention to it, we worked with state officials, etc, but we feel confident that that didn\u2019t occur and that the votes were cast and they were counted. ON declassification: \u201cWe will provide evidence that we can safely provide, that does not compromise sources and methods, but... when you\u2019re talking about cybersecurity, a lot is classified... if we\u2019re going to monitor this stuff effectively going forward, we don\u2019t want them to know that we know. \u201cUnless the American people genuinely think that the professionals in [the intelligence community including Republicans] are less trustworthy than the Russians, then people should pay attention to what our intelligence agencies say. We\u2019ve got to pay attention to what\u2019s happening to our political culture here.\u201d Obama says that Russia is smaller and weaker and can\u2019t hurt America... except: Their economy doesn\u2019t produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. They don\u2019t innovate. But they can impact if we lose track of who we are... if we start buying into notions that it\u2019s OK to intimidate the press, or lock up dissidents, or discriminate against people because of their faith, or what they look like... you\u2019re starting to see certain Republican party and voters... starting to see a government contrary to everything we stand for as being OK because that\u2019s how much we dislike Democrats. Some folks who had made a career about being anti-Russian didn\u2019t say anything about it. Then after the election they say, well why didn\u2019t you tell us that the Russians were trying to elect our candidate. Now come on.... Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave. And how did that happen?... Because for too long, everything that happens in this town, everything that\u2019s said, is through the prism of, does this help or hurt us relative to Democrats? Relative to president Obama? \u201cWe\u2019ve lost track of what we\u2019re about and what we stand for.\u201d As for appointments, those are up to Trump, Obama says, and to the senate to advise and consent. On safe zones, Obama says, \u201cif you set those zones up on Syrian territory, then that requires some force that is willing to maintain that territory in the absence of consent from the Syrian government and now the Russians and the Iranians. It may be that with Aleppo\u2019s tragic situation unfolding, if we can get some of the tens of thousands that are trapped there out... find some arrangement perhaps in coordination with Turkey whereby those people will be safe... unfortunately we\u2019re not even there yet, because right now we have Russians and Assad claiming that all the innocent civilians that were trapped in Aleppo are out... try to put pressure wherever we can to try to get them out. I will help president-elect Trump with any advice counsel information that we can provide. Obama continues. \u201cI mean that with all sincerity. I understand the impulse to want to do something, but ultimately I\u2019ve had to think about what can we sustain, what is realistic and what\u2019s the right thing to do for America?\u201d Obama says he provided moderate support to the opposition, tried to minimize the extremist jihadi presence and tried to pressure international partners. \u201cI cannot claim that we\u2019ve been successful,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I continue to believe it was the right approach, given what realistically we could get done.\u201d Question: on Aleppo, do you feel any personal moral responsibility for the carnage? And Trump wants safe zones, which you\u2019ve opposed. Will you support him? Obama: \u201cMike I always feel responsible. I felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people were being displaced... for murder and slaughter that\u2019s taking place in South Sudan that\u2019s not being reported... There\u2019s places around the world where horrible things are happening, and because of my office I feel responsible... there\u2019s not a moment during the course of this presidency where I haven\u2019t felt some responsibility. That\u2019s true by the way for our own country... With respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course I can to try to end the civil war while taking into account the long term national interest of the United States... Obama says he went through every option in Syria in painful detail with maps, humanitarian agencies, the military... but \u201cshort of putting large numbers of US troops on the ground, uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress... just gone through a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars, when the opposition on the ground was not cohesive enough...and you had a military superpower in Russia...and a regional power in Iran... that in that circumstance, unless we were all in and we were willing to take over Syria, then we were going to have problems. And everything else sounded tempting... but it was impossible to do this on the cheap...\u201d Obama pauses as someone passes out or faints. Obama says go get a doctor. Obama resumes. \u201cIt may be that... Nope, they need a doctor. A woman appears to have fallen down. She has been picked up. Now they are helping her from the room. They\u2019re going for a doctor. Questions for Obama: what about Clinton\u2019s contention that Comey\u2019s letter about emails on Abedin/Weiner\u2019s computer affected the outcome of the election? Also, what\u2019s risk of Trump ignoring Russian hack? Obama takes second question first: \u201cThe transition from election season to governance season is not always smooth. You know it\u2019s bumpy.\u201d \u201cWhen Donald Trump takes the oath of office and is sworn in, he\u2019s got a different set of responsibilities and considerations.\u201d On his conversations with Trump: \u201cThey have been cordial, and in some cases have involved me making some pretty specific suggestions about how to be sure...a bout maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions. And he has listened. I can\u2019t say that he will end up implementing...and I will always make myself available to him.\u201d On the FBI: \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to know a lot of FBI agents... they take their job seriously. They work really hard. They help keep us safe and save a lot of lives... \u201cSometimes that involves investigations that touch on politics. In this hyperpartisan environment everything is suspect... one thing I have done...is not wading into investigation decisions... to be strict in my own behaviour about preserving the independence of law enforcement.... I don\u2019t know why it would stop now. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m going on here is because I know you guys have a lot of questions about this. \u201cWith respect to response, my principle goal... was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch, that it was not tarnish, and that it did not feed any sense in the public that tampering had taken place in the actual process of voting. \u201cOur goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia and others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you... some of it we can do publicly, some of it we will do in a way that they know it, but not everybody will.\u201d \u201cWe already have enormous numbers of sanctions on the Russians... how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them... but does not creat ea problem for us is something that\u2019s worth taking time to figure out. \u201cThere are times where the message will be directly received by the Russians and not publicized.\u201d \u201cI should point out that part of the reason the Russians have been effective is they\u2019re not going around the world saying look at what we did!\u201d Obama is asked whether Clinton lost because of the Russians: I\u2019m going to let all the political pundits in this town have a long discussion about what happened... it was a fascinating election... I\u2019ve said what is important for the Democratic party... rather than trying to parse every aspect of the election... I don\u2019t think she was treated fairly during the election... I think the coverage of her and the issues was troubling. But having said that, what I\u2019m most focused on... I can maybe give some counsel and advice to the Democratic party, and the thing we have to spend the most time on is, how do we make sure that we\u2019re showing up in places where I think Democratic policies are needed...but people feel like they\u2019re not being heard... We have to be in those communities. Obama: I\u2019m finding it a little curious that everybody\u2019s acting surprised that this would have undermined the election of Hillary Clinton because you guys wrote about it every day ... this was an obsession that dominated the news coverage. I do think it\u2019s [important to ask how such a momentous election] came to be dominated by these leaks. \u201cThis was not some elaborate, complicated espionage scheme. They hacked into some Democratic party emails that contained fairly routine stuff. Some of it embarrassing or controversial ... And then it just took off. And that concerns me, and it should concern all of us. But the truth of the matter is that everybody had the information. \u201cMoving forward, I think there are a couple issues that this raises. Number one, the constant challenges that we are going to have with cybersecurity ... this particular concern around Russian hacking is part of a broader set of concerns about how do we deal with cybersecurity.\u201d Obama points out that Trump was raising questions about the integrity of the election. He says that the White House undermining that integrity further would not have been good. \u201cIn early September when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way ... was to talk to him directly, and to tell him to cut it out and there would be consequences if they didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe did not see further tampering of the election process, but the leaks from Wikileaks were already out there.\u201d \u201cI think we handled it the way it should have been handled,\u201d he says. First question for Obama: Are you letting Vladimir Putin for hacking the US election? Do you agree that the hacking was partially responsible for Clinton\u2019s loss? Obama says with respect to the transition, the Trump team would acknowledge that he\u2019s done everything his team can to help it. Obama and Trump spoke a few days ago, he says. \u201cThe Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC,\u201d Obama says. \u201cIt is important for us to review all elements of that... that should be a bipartisan issue, that shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. .. My hope is that the president-elect is going to be similarly concerned that we shouldn\u2019t have foreign interference in our election process.\u201d \u201cI think it is important for us to distinguish between the politics of the election and the need for us as a country... to make sure that we don\u2019t create a political football here.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go through the facts... at the beginning of the summer, we\u2019re alerted to the possibility that the DNC has been hacked.\u201d Obama says he ordered a thorough investigation and had the victims of the DNC briefed and Congress briefed. \u201cOnce we had clarity and certainty around what had happened, we publicly announced that in fact Russia had hacked into the DNC. At that time we did not attribute motives... we did not discuss what the effects of that might be.\u201d Obama says the media interpreted the hacking. \u201cWe did not [because]... I wanted to make sure that everybody understood we were playing this thing straight.\u201d Obama says \u201cyou might want to take this into account,\u201d was the White House message at the time. Obama warns that the tragedy of Aleppo is deepening and says the crisis is the exclusive fault of \u201cthe Assad regime and its allies Russia and Iran, and its blood is on their hands.\u201d \u201cRegretfully but unsurprisingly, Russia has blocked the security council from taking action on these issues,\u201d Obama says. \u201cOver the long term, the Assad regime cannot slaughter its way to legitimacy,\u201d Obama says. \u201cThe Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies are trying to obfuscate the truth. The world should not be fooled. And the world will not forget.\u201d Obama claims troop drawdowns overseas from 180,000+ to 15,000 and says \u201cno foreign terrorist organization has successfully carried out an attack on our homeland that was directed from overseas.\u201d \u201cBy so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started.\u201d He credits the American people. \u201cI could not be prouder to be your president.\u201d There\u2019s a lot more work to be done, he says. Obama says he\u2019s going to talk about \u201chow far we\u2019ve come over the past eight years.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the longest streak of job growth on record,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the first time in history, 90% of Americans are insured\u201d on health, he says. He says he prevented a crisis on Wall Street without stifling growth. \u201cThe stock market has nearly tripled.\u201d \u201cLast year the poverty rate fell at the fastest rate in almost 50 years. ... and we\u2019ve done all this by cutting our deficits by nearly two-thirds.\u201d Here\u2019s Obama. The FBI agrees with the CIA\u2019s assessment that Russian hackers tried to tip the US election to Donald Trump, the Washington Post is reporting. The Post report quotes a statement by CIA director John Brennan Trump has denied the hacking occurred, though in July he invited Russian hackers to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cmissing\u201d emails, and on 8 October, one month before the election, the office of the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a joint statement formally accusing Russia of hacking the Democratic party\u2019s computer networks. The FBI, where a culture thrived of deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton, had not previously joined the CIA and DHS assessment of the situation. Barack Obama has ordered an intelligence community review of evidence of Russian hacking in the presidential election. Journalists in heavy attendance for this one: Here\u2019s a live video stream: Sobering thought. Hello and welcome to our live blog coverage of Barack Obama\u2019s final pre-holiday press conference.
