I almost got kidnapped a few times, too.\u201d The director, 45, is recalling the initial months of research in the Mexican state of Sinaloa that led him to make The Golden Dream, a stirring, evocative and tragic tale of three young Latino migrants trying to find their way to the United States. \u201cThe most dangerous part of the process was the research because Sinaloa was quite a drug-trafficking state and I was alone with just an audio recorder like yours and a notebook. Fortunately, one night I met this taxi driver whom I became good friends with. He invited me to come and live with his family, downtown in a city called Mazatl\u00e1n, right on the rail tracks. Every day at nine, 10 in the morning, the cargo train would arrive and there would be 60 or 80 migrants who would get off. They\u2019d knock on the door and ask for food or for water or shoes or to take a shower. We\u2019d be waiting for them and talking to them and I was deeply touched by the stories, the drama that they were going through in order to help their families.\u201d Over the course of six years, Quemada-Diez completed more than 600 interviews and created what he calls a \u201ccollective testimony\u201d, a narrative compiled from the shared experience of those who were riding the roofs of the trains. They were often young and alone, taking enormous risks as they travelled across central America and towards the US border. \u201cI just felt that they were heroes,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of those I interviewed would say to me, \u2018OK, I may die on this journey, but I would rather die trying than die where I come from.\u2019 They would travel with all they had in a small backpack or even a plastic bag, but it\u2019s a journey that can take you 40 to 60 days and you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll encounter. You may get deported, you may get assaulted, you may have no food, you may have no money because everybody takes your money, they steal your shoes. Everything that happens in the film, someone either told me about it, it happened to me or I saw it happen to someone else.\u201d Those observed details stand out from the very beginning of The Golden Dream, as two adolescents, Sara and Juan, plan their escape from a Guatemalan village. Sara is cutting her hair and strapping down her breasts in the hope of passing herself off as a boy. Juan is sowing banknotes into the hem of his trousers. As they journey towards the land of cowboys and snow (Juan is obsessed, having never seen it in reality), the pair encounter another boy, an indigenous Indian called Chauk. Neither can speak the other\u2019s language, but the trio band together in pursuit of their common dream. If it sounds like a touching tale of friendship it is, in parts, but it\u2019s one that also threatens tragedy at every stop. \u2018I wanted to convey the idea of brotherhood beyond races, beyond nationalities, beyond these artificial creations. In a pragmatic way, we all share the planet\u2019 With a short, groomed beard, thick brown hair and strikingly blue eyes, Quemada-Diez looks as if he should be on the other side of the camera. He talks softly and gently, with a deliberate air of humility couching most of his responses. Born and raised in Burgos, an old city in northern Spain (which, curiously, also gave its name to a set of 16th-century laws that were the first to protect the subjects of Spain\u2019s new American colonies), he knew from a young age that he wanted to go into film. With his parents unable to pay to send him to film school, he volunteered instead on Spanish productions as a runner, or \u201cthe Coke boy\u201d (I think he means the drink). His big break arrived unexpectedly, when Ken Loach came to Spain in the early 90s to film civil war drama, Land And Freedom. Quemada-Diez became his clapper loader. \u201cI got an opportunity because I spoke English and I knew how to load magazines into cameras,\u201d he says. \u201cI loaded all the film on that movie, which was, I think, one million feet of film. We shot a lot.\u201d Quemada-Diez went on to become something of a protege of Loach, working on his next two films, this time as an assistant camera operator. And by shooting a lot, he also learned a lot. \u201cKen\u2019s method is incredible and I applied a lot of it to this film,\u201d he says, before reeling off a list of things he gleaned from the English master. \u201cThere\u2019s the idea of shooting in continuity; that the actors don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next and you create a context for them to discover their motives without them really ever knowing. You create an experience that they feel is real, then all you have to do is film it. \u201cAnother thing about Ken\u2019s method is how he manages to make his films so human. He makes all these human movies, but how does he do that? He puts the human being at the centre. The camera is always at the level of the human eye, he\u2019s obsessed with that. He never puts the camera where there would not be a human being. Literally there is always a human point of view: no cranes, no helicopter, no Steadicam, no dollies, no devices.\u201d Loach\u2019s influence extended beyond technical method, however. Quemada-Diez says that when working on Land And Freedom he was immediately struck by the realisation that \u201cyou make films in order to reflect our contemporary reality\u201d and that \u201cyou can make some kind of positive impact, even if it\u2019s just that somebody\u2019s not going to look at a migrant in the same way.\u201d The Golden Dream, he says, is a film that pits the idea of progress, as symbolised by a train snaking its way towards the American border, against human needs and desires. \u201cWe cannot get anywhere if we only look after ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to convey the idea of brotherhood beyond races, beyond nationalities, beyond these artificial creations. In a pragmatic way, we all share the planet. The train became in a way a production line. Because the United States needs all these raw materials and people, cheap labour, in order to produce more and more things, but what is the cost of that? I was always clear that I wanted to show a United States that we hadn\u2019t seen before, one that\u2019s grey, that\u2019s full of concrete, full of factories, there are no trees, there\u2019s nothing. As the United States gets to the end of its cycle, there is only concrete and freeways; the idea of progress, the end of that, is the complete destruction of nature.\u201d The Golden Dream is at times a bleak film, and a brutal one. But it is also hopeful and beautiful. Long shots that show the train wending its way through the Mexican countryside, a field of corn next to the American border, the tender moments that the incomprehensible Chauk shares with his friends (and the audience) are the moments that stay with you. In the end, they\u2019re the things that ring true. The Golden Dream is in cinemas on Friday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
