Speaking to Farage on LBC Radio, the US president also said Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could prevent the UK from agreeing a trade deal with the US. Trump said the US \u201ccan\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK\u201d under \u201ccertain aspects of the deal\u201d, despite Johnson\u2019s claims it would allow the UK to have an independent trade policy. One of Labour\u2019s main attacks against Johnson has been that the prime minister would be too close to Trump and allow a sell-off of public services to US companies as the price of a trade deal, with the NHS potentially on the line. Trump told LBC listeners that he was not interested in buying the NHS, and criticised Corbyn as \u201cso bad for your country\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019d be so bad, he\u2019d take you in such a bad way. He\u2019d take you into such bad places,\u201d he added. Trump told Farage he had reservations over Johnson\u2019s deal, because it could prevent trade with the US, but he denied Corbyn\u2019s claims it would mean the NHS was up for sale to American health corporations. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where [it] started with respect to us taking over your healthcare system. I mean it\u2019s so ridiculous. I think Corbyn put that out there, but to even think, it was never even mentioned, I never even heard it until I went over to visit with the Queen,\u201d he said. During that trip, Trump had fuelled speculation that the US would want access to NHS contracts for US corporations by saying that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d. He later backtracked by saying: \u201cI don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table.\u201d A No 10 spokesman contradicted Trump\u2019s claim that a UK-US trade deal might not be possible under Johnson\u2019s Brexit withdrawal agreement. \u201cThe PM negotiated a new deal which ensures that we take back control of our laws, trade, borders and money \u2013 a deal which people said he could never negotiate. Under this new deal the whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union, which means we can strike our own free trade deals.\u201d On Johnson, the US president said: \u201cWe want to do trade with the UK but to be honest with you, this deal, under certain aspects of the deal, you can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t trade. We can\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK. I think we can do many times the numbers we\u2019re doing right now, and certainly much bigger numbers than you\u2019re doing under the EU. Boris wants to be very careful with it. Under certain ways we would be precluded, which would be ridiculous.\u201d In remarks that are unlikely to be welcomed in Downing Street, Trump said Johnson was a \u201cfantastic man and [the] exact right guy for the times\u201d, and added that he could form an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d by pairing with Farage. Trump also told Farage that Johnson \u201chas a lot of respect and like for you\u201d. \u201cHe respects you a lot, I can tell you that, he respects you a lot, I don\u2019t know if you know that or not,\u201d Trump told Farage. \u201cBut, cause I have no idea I have enough to do over here without having to worry about the psychology of two brilliant people over there, frankly ... I wish you two guys could get together, I think it would be a great thing.\u201d Responding to the US president\u2019s comments, Corbyn accused Trump of \u201ctrying to interfere in Britain\u2019s election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected\u201d. \u201cIt was Trump who said in June the NHS is \u2018on the table\u2019. And he knows if Labour wins US corporations won\u2019t get their hands on it. Our NHS is not for sale,\u201d Corbyn tweeted. Farage agreed with Trump\u2019s criticism of Johnson\u2019s deal, as he has been arguing that it represents \u201cBrexit in name only\u201d. He vowed the Brexit party would challenge the Conservatives at the ballot box. However, Farage has refused to be drawn over reports the Brexit party is engulfed in a row over how many seats it should contest at the election. Some Brexit party supporters and candidates are concerned that the leave vote could split and boost Corbyn\u2019s chances. Farage described the idea that his party may only focus on 20 to 30 leave-voting Labour seats in the north of England as \u201cidle speculation\u201d. At the Brexit party launch on Friday, Farage will reveal his strategy for the campaign after coming under pressure from two different factions in his party. On the one side, some pragmatists are warning that standing in Tory-Labour marginals could help Corbyn. But many of his candidates are desperate to run and oppose Johnson\u2019s deal, which they see as not being a \u201creal\u201d Brexit. Farage, who has been at a Trump hotel in Washington DC this week, explained his party\u2019s dilemma on a podcast alongside the former Trump aide Steve Bannon. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem. We\u2019ve got the forces of remain, the globalists. We\u2019ve got the Liberal Democrats who want to literally cancel the results of the referendum. Labour, they want a second referendum. We\u2019ve then got my position which is we leave the EU institutions and become an independent country. \u201cBoris Johnson, who is very jolly, brings a lot of energy and optimism and is a thousand times better than Theresa May, [but] he has basically picked up Mrs May\u2019s failed deal. It is not a deal \u2026 Boris is trying to deliver Brexit in name only to an exhausted public ... it\u2019s not great. If Boris signs this then my view is that we will not have a proper trade deal with the US.\u201d He also dismissed fears about food and medicine shortages during a no-deal Brexit, saying: \u201cDuring the war, the German U-boats sunk a lot of ships and we still didn\u2019t starve.\u201d Robert Hayward, a Tory peer and election analyst, said on Thursday that the Conservatives could actually suffer in some places if the Brexit party stood down its candidates. \u201cThere is no certainty that the withdrawal of Brexit party candidates will automatically help the Tories,\u201d he said. \u201cIn large swathes of the Midlands, north and Wales, Brexit voters are ex-Labour voters and would \u2013 to misuse a well known phrase \u2013 \u2018rather die in a ditch\u2019 than vote Tory. There are therefore many marginals in those areas where the presence of a Brexit candidate would help the Tories not hinder them.\u201d There was disaffection among some Brexit party candidates about the idea of drastically reducing the number of seats the party contested. Ahmad Malik, the candidate for Chesham and Amersham, tweeted that the Brexit party was \u201cNOT an appendage or facsimile of the Conservatives\u201d, and added: \u201cHow can you \u2018split\u2019 a vote that doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d Malik urged leave supporters to \u201chold your nerve and resolve\u201d. His tweet was shared by other party candidates who would be expected to stand down if the party rolled back its election efforts, including Malcolm McLeod in Rochester and Strood, and even some based in leave-dominated Labour seats, such as Faye Clements in Middlesbrough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
