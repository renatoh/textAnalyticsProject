This win over Hibernian, which was ultimately more comfortable than the scoreline suggests, ensures they take their place in the League Cup final next month, where Rangers or Hearts will lie in wait. Neil Lennon\u2019s only gripe may be that Celtic did not press home their superiority over Hibs in more emphatic style; strange as that may seem for a victory by a three-goal margin. \u201cWe were breathtaking today from start to finish,\u201d said Celtic\u2019s manager. \u201cI can\u2019t speak highly enough of the mentality of the team. The way they went about their business made it very comfortable.\u201d The weight of expectation sat firmly on the shoulders of Celtic\u2019s players. They entered this semi-final having won 29 domestic cup ties in succession. The sense of Lennon\u2019s team being strong favourites \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 was further endorsed by Hibs\u2019 struggles under Paul Heckingbottom. The ability of the former Barnsley and Leeds manager to recruit adeptly for the Scottish top flight has been open to serious question with Hibs delivering a series of lame performances. Here, they were ragged. Nonetheless, and in hinting briefly at the unpredictable nature of cup football, Hibs opened brightly. Daryl Horgan curled an effort narrowly over Fraser Forster\u2019s crossbar in the eighth minute. Celtic\u2019s reply \u2013 their first clearcut opportunity \u2013 was forceful enough to open the scoring. It also did the referee, Bobby Madden, a favour after he ignored a blatant handball by the Hibs captain, Paul Hanlon, inside his own penalty area. James Forrest, fresh from signing a contract extension, showed skill and patience before chipping the ball to the back post. There waited Mohamed Elyounoussi, who was composed with a headed finish back across the diving Chris Maxwell. The officials were to the fore again before Celtic doubled their advantage. Odsonne \u00c9douard was offside as Christopher Jullien delivered a long ball to his fellow Frenchman. With no flag raised, \u00c9douard actually miscontrolled when racing in on goal. He recovered sufficiently to flick the ball across the advancing Maxwell and into the path of Callum McGregor. The midfielder\u2019s task was blissfully simple and he tapped the ball into an empty net. Hibs, to their credit, responded. Melker Hallberg hauled them back into the match after the Celtic left-back Boli Bolingoli had unwittingly played the ball right to the Swede\u2019s feet. Bolingoli had been attempting to snuff out an inconsequential Hibs attack. Celtic did not fancy heading into the dressing room to incur Lennon\u2019s wrath. Trickery from \u00c9douard preceded a pass across goal to Elyounoussi, who lashed into the roof of the net from close range. Elyounoussi was agonisingly denied his hat-trick by the post within five minutes of the restart, and Forrest also cracked the woodwork soon after. The paucity of Hibs\u2019 defending in the most basic of situations rendered the key question just how many Celtic would score. Number four was due to arrive and soon did. Maxwell made a hash of an Elyounoussi corner when under pressure from Jullien, with Scott Brown on hand to poke home. This marked a rare goal for the Celtic captain. With many of their supporters heading for the exits, Hibs somehow clawed another goal back. Florian Kamberi, introduced at half-time, headed past Forster from a fine Tom James cross. Brown, terrific throughout, was to seal Hibs\u2019 fate. The midfielder scored Celtic\u2019s fifth at the second attempt after Maxwell saved his first shot from an Elyounoussi pass. \u201cI thought Celtic were very good but we played a part in that,\u201d said Heckingbottom. Whether such recurring generosity triggers action from the manager\u2019s superiors remains to be seen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
