Appearing before the House judiciary committee on Wednesday morning, Mueller was even more buttoned-down than his crisp white shirt. Not only did the former special counsel refuse to read aloud from his own report (\u201cI\u2019m happy to have you read it,\u201d he said repeatedly), but a flustered Mueller also failed to remember which president had appointed him to his first major justice department post. (It was Ronald Reagan and not, as Mueller guessed, George HW Bush.) The predictable and sometimes tedious judiciary committee hearing proved that Mueller lacks both the prosecutorial zeal and the performance skills to star in a remake of Watergate. Democrats may still try to make the case that Donald Trump perverted justice, but it is hard to see how Mueller helped their cause with his mantra, \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate\u201d. By the time the hearing ended at lunchtime, it was not safe for impeachment-minded Democrats to pass too close to an open window on a high floor. But then in a dramatic rescue mission, reminiscent of the cavalry riding over the hill in an old-time western, Adam Schiff transformed the political equation as he convened the afternoon hearing of the House intelligence committee, which he chairs. Schiff instinctively understood that Mueller \u2013 the straight-arrow marine and former FBI director \u2013 is at his core a moralist and a patriot. Playing to an audience of one in his compelling opening statement, Schiff said: \u201cThe story of the 2016 election is a story about disloyalty to country, about greed and about lies. Your investigation determined that the Trump campaign \u2013 including Donald Trump himself \u2013 knew that a foreign power was intervening in our election and welcomed it, built Russian meddling into their strategy, and used it.\u201d After describing Trump\u2019s panting eagerness for Russian aid as \u201cdisloyalty to country\u201d, Schiff added a sentence that does not normally pop up in the gospel according to MSNBC: \u201cThat disloyalty may not have been criminal \u2026 but disloyalty to country violates the very oath of citizenship.\u201d An unfortunate legacy of Watergate is that liberals see everything through a legalistic lens. As we get caught up in the technicalities of what constitutes obstruction of justice (the key offense that brought down Richard Nixon), we tend to lose sight of the deliberate Vladimir Putin-spawned conspiracy to undermine western democracy. And we forget the degree to which Trump was \u2013 and may well still be \u2013 Moscow\u2019s willing enabler. As the Republicans tried to undermine Mueller by embracing every handy conspiracy theory (somehow they missed the faking of the moon landing), the Democrats on the intelligence committee kept reminding the nation that Trump lied repeatedly about having no business interests in Russia. In fact, at times in 2016, Trump seemed more passionate about building a Trump Tower in Moscow than he was about winning the White House. This set-up the dramatic final round of questioning as Schiff finally lured Mueller out of his heavily guarded Fortress of His Own Rectitude. After discussing the potential for Russian blackmail, Schiff asked Mueller: \u201cSo if candidate Trump was saying \u2018I have no dealings with the Russians\u2019 but the Russians had a tape recording, they could expose that, could they not?\u201d And rather than refusing to speculate or retreating back to the wording of his report, Mueller uttered a powerful one-word answer: \u201cYes.\u201d Emboldened Schiff went further as he said, leading the witness: \u201cThat is the stuff of counterintelligence nightmares, is it not?\u201d Again, rather than ducking the implications of the question, Mueller replied: \u201cWell, it has to do with counterintelligence and the need for a strong counterintelligence entity.\u201d Maybe this soundbite will not play powerfully on television (alas, the current standard for political relevance) since there was no yelling or pointing of fingers. But it is telling that Robert Mueller \u2013 a terse and reluctant witness who probably wouldn\u2019t speculate about tomorrow\u2019s weather \u2013 said, in effect, that Donald Trump in the White House represents the essence of a national security nightmare. It is folly to immediately predict the reverberations from the most anxiously awaited congressional hearings of the Trump era. But it would be fitting if Trump \u2013 like another strutting autocrat named Napoleon \u2013 saw his imperial dreams begin to crumble at the gates of Moscow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
