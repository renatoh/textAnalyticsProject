Occasionally I read the Sun just to see what important celebrity birthdays are happening, and sometimes the Guardian, the Observer and the Independent. It's weird because my wife's the broadsheet person and I go for the gossipy tabloids. Magazines My son is 11 and he's a real addict to things like Stuff so I'm always reading that. I read Esquire sometimes and I like those little local magazines like North-West magazine. I also like Wallpaper* and Fabric. Books I'm still working my way through the new Harry Potter and I've just finished reading White Teeth - I quite liked it but sometimes books get over-hyped. I tried reading The Da Vinci Code and gave up because everyone kept telling me everything. I've just read Diane Melly's book, Take a Girl Like Me, which was great. TV I'm a bit of a channel surfer. I love BBC2. I know it sounds naff, but we watch University Challenge. And I watch lots of documentaries, anything about Romans or by Fred Dibnah. I saw a great documentary with Jane Milligan about her dad [Spike], called I Told You I Was Ill. I'm forced to sit through The X Factor with the kids, but I like Ant 'n' Dec. Radio I have got about six radios in the house. We have got digital radio which means that I can listen to things like The Arrow, a digital rock station. Then I listen to lots of Radio 2 and BBC London, of course, just to see what they are saying about me. I'm up and down the commercial stations, and I also listen to Radio 5 Live quite a lot as well. Ads I used to be a copywriter in advertising and my wife produces TV commercials, so it's an interesting topic for us. The new Guinness ad is really good, the one where they evolve and go backwards. I just hate those \"But wait, there's more\" ones. I'm always making fun of them on the radio. New media Oh yes, I've got my own website, jonocoleman.com. We're a bit of a dangerously hi-tech household. I've got a BlackBerry. \u00b7 Jono Coleman presents the breakfast show on BBC London 94.9"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
