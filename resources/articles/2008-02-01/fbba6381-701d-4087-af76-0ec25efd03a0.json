Only last month, her faltering campaign brought in only $14 million and she had to lend her campaign $5 million from her personal fortune to keep it afloat. Howard Ickes, one of her campaign managers, in a conference call with reporters, said she had gone through a dry spell during which he has lost the last 11 contests but was now on an \"upswing\". Her campaign team said the funding disproved claims in the New York Times that donors were drying up in anticipation she was going to lose. Bill Burton, a spokesman for Barack Obama, who has yet to announce his funding figures for the month, said he had raised \"considerably more\" than Clinton. Obama raised $36 million in January, setting a new record for the primary and caucus contests. The two go into Tuesday with Clinton ahead in the polls in Ohio but in a dead heat in Texas. The New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, finally announced he has opted against running as an independent in the White House race. Making his announcement in the New York Times, the multi-billionaire dangled the prospect of his backing in return for policy pledges from the candidate that comes closest to his own views. He said he would help the candidate prepared to buck party orthodoxy. He did not specify what help he would give. US election funding laws are complex and there are limits on individual contributions. But he is important in other ways, with a formidable talent as a fundraiser."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
