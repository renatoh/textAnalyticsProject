For Petr Cech, the emotions were still more intense. The Chelsea goalkeeper was not only taken back to his own brush with mortality in 2006, when he suffered the notoriously sickening collision with Stephen Hunt at Reading, but he was left with a stark realisation. If it were not for the advances in emergency medical care that were put into place after his head injury, Muamba might not have made it out of the stadium alive. \"I was watching the game,\" Cech said, \"and you don't say you're glad but after what happened at Reading with me, when you saw me crawling off the pitch and then it took so much time before I was carried on the stretcher \u2026 people couldn't get me out of the dressing room. Imagine if that had happened with Fabrice. By the time somebody managed to get him out, he might have no chance. \"At least I was glad to see that the medical issues and all the structure has changed for the better. He still has a chance to survive because of all the equipment around the pitch. It's a great change because sometimes it takes only a few seconds to change a whole life and a whole career. It's good now that after what happened with me at Reading, the people get the medical facilities and [the] rules [have] really improved.\" Cech suffered a depressed fracture of the skull in the coming-together with Hunt in the Premier League game at the Madejski Stadium on 14 October 2006 and he underwent life-saving neurosurgery. Chelsea's manager at the time, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, was critical of the time it took the ambulance to transfer Cech to hospital and Chelsea submitted an official complaint that led to a Premier League and Football Association review;. \"There are some things that leave me in a very emotional situation,\" Mourinho said. \"My goalkeeper was waiting for an ambulance for 30 minutes. This is something English football has to think about. This is much more important than football.\" [See footnote.] A host of measures were introduced in the wake of the incident. An ambulance for the exclusive use of players had to be provided at all stadiums; clubs had a doctor on the bench; paramedics were stationed at pitchside; advances were made in the medical equipment that was readily available and doctors and physiotherapists had to complete Area (advanced resuscitation and emergency aid) training courses. Muamba's battle for his life was helped by the presence of a specialist in the White Hart Lane crowd. Andrew Deaner, a consultant cardiologist at the London Chest Hospital, came on to the pitch to offer his advice and he accompanied Muamba to the specialist unit at which he works, which is rated the best in the country. The Bolton Wanderers midfielder was treated by six medics on the pitch and everyone has marvelled at the skill and hard work of the medical professionals involved. At times such as these, the importance of the national sport is put into perspective. \"At the moment football is the last thing,\" Cech said. \"From the start, when I woke up after the operation or a few days later, football was the last thing I was thinking about. You want to try to recover your life in a normal way. Then, when you know you have a chance, you can think further. Hopefully he can make the first step. You need to do that.\" The messages of goodwill continued to pour in and the football community stood united. There were shows of support at Sunday's matches, including Chelsea's FA Cup victory over Leicester City at Stamford Bridge, in which Gary Cahill, who played alongside Muamba at Bolton for two-and-a-half seasons, unveiled a message on his vest after scoring the opening goal: \"Pray 4 Muamba.\" \"You could see that Gary had a message and everybody at the club made a statement prior to the game [with the round of applause],\" Cech said. \"We all hope that Fabrice is going to have a chance to recover and we all have thoughts for his family. It's going to be a very difficult time for everyone close to him. \"You feel for the family and the people who are close to him and, also, for the people and players who were on the pitch. It's really hard to see something like that. At the time I got injured, nobody really knew how serious it was at first. But you could see straight away how serious that was on Saturday. Everybody made the right decision to stop the game. I don't think the players would have had the concentration to continue.\" \u2022 This footnote was added on 29 March 2012. The Mourinho statement implies that the ambulance service took 30 minutes to respond. In fact the sequence of events was that the on field collision took place at 17.16, and Chelsea football club's medical staff called for an ambulance at 17.45. An ambulance arrived seven minutes later at 17.52."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
