Utah\u2019s lawsuit claims that a federal plan to protect the sage-grouse has \u201coverthrown\u201d the state\u2019s own work to safeguard the species and will prevent the state from using vast tracts of land for mining or agriculture. The greater sage-grouse is a ground-dwelling bird that has been described as resembling an \u201cavant-garde turkey\u201d. The plan, brokered by the Department of the Interior and unveiled in September, involves protecting millions of acres of federal land across 11 western states. It was seen as a compromise to avoid a federal endangered species listing, which would have imposed far more onerous restrictions upon the states. But governor Gary Herbert of Utah said that the federal initiative was \u201cin many ways more restrictive\u201d than an endangered species act designation as it limits mining in 3.3m acres (1.3m hectares) of sage-grouse habitat in the state. \u201cI have always believed that, as a state, Utah is better positioned to manage our sage-grouse population than the federal government,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cUtah has adopted a strong conservation plan designed to protect, enhance and restore sage-grouse habitats throughout the state.\u201d Utah has claimed success in its own sage-grouse conservation plan, launched in 2013, which it states has helped increase numbers and restored tracts of habitat on private and public land. But conservationists argue that the state is simply attempting to strip away protections in order to push ahead with a pro-mining agenda. The greater sage-grouse once occupied more than 290m acres of sagebrush across America\u2019s west, with early European settlers reporting seeing millions of the birds take to the skies. The male sage-grouse takes part in an elaborate mating ritual during spring, which involves strutting around a prepared piece of bare ground called a lek. Females gather around to evaluate suitable mates. But the species has lost half of its habitat since European arrival and its protection has become a touchstone issue for environmentalists. The federal government was set to list it as an endangered species in 2010, only to switch focus to higher-priority animals. Erik Molvar, a senior campaigner at WildEarth Guardians, said the federal plan was already \u201cweak and tepid\u201d due to lobbying from states including Utah. \u201cThe Obama administration has already bent over backwards to make the sage-grouse plan as optional and conducive to industrial use as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s far short of what the science dictates, for example there are inadequate buffers around dancing grounds to protect nesting habitats. \u201cThe state of Utah may inadvertently trigger an endangered species listing by kicking the legs away of this conservation plan. They will end up with much stronger and more stringent safeguards through the Endangered Species Act. \u201cThe state wants to pull back the safeguards so there is no protection for the sage-grouse at all. They are living in a fantasy world if they think that will be the final outcome.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
