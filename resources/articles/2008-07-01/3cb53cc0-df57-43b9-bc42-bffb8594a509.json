In fact, it's not just the capital where you will see such daubs - a rapid rise in the popularity of car clubs has been witnessed in cities across the UK as more urban drivers begin to question the logic of owning their own car. Rising fuel costs and motoring taxes have forced drivers to seek alternatives. And with public transport in many locations struggling to tempt these disillusioned drivers aboard, many are now joining a car club. The simplicity and convenience of the car-club concept is one of its key appeals: once you have signed up as a member, you are given an electronic card that acts as a key to any of the car-club vehicles parked in your area. After booking a period of use online or by text, you can then drive the car away, paying an hourly or daily rate according to your needs. Gone are the paperwork hassles of renting a car and the headaches associated with owning your own car. Membership numbers have been growing steadily over the past few years, but car clubs have stubbornly remained a niche interest. However, this week two of the leading car clubs - Streetcar and City Car Club - both announced a sudden surge in members. They say that a likely catalyst was the moment the chancellor revealed increases in motoring taxes in his budget speech in March. Streetcar said that in the period from March to June its UK membership leapt from 27,537 to 37,532. Similarly, City Car Club reported a 300% increase in membership requests since March compared with the same period last year. It now has more than 6,000 UK members. \"We have seen the biggest increase in members in our history after Alistair Darling's last budget,\" says James Finlayson, City Car Club's chief executive. \"Clearly the huge rise in the cost of motoring has made many motorists realise they need to change the way they own and use a car.\" Brett Akker, co-founder of Streetcar, also says his firm has not seen such interest since it launched in 2004 with just eight cars. \"We've definitely seen a spike since the budget and the fuel-price rises. We now have more than 800 cars in our fleet. By the end of this year we expect to have 50,000 UK members and will have 1,000 vehicles in place to meet demand.\" Could this be the tipping point for car clubs in the UK? This country has certainly been slow off the mark, given that the first car club dates back to the late 1940s in Zurich, Switzerland. Ever since the 1960s, car clubs have been operating in cities around the world, but particularly in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada and the US. Zipcar, the world's largest car club, now has more than 180,000 members and 5,000 vehicles in urban areas and college campuses across the US and Canada. It now offers vehicles in London, too. There are certainly compelling economic reasons to sign up to a car club. Streetcar estimates that using one its VW Golfs instead of owning your own will save you about \u00a31,500 a year based on typical urban driving habits. Once you factor in depreciation, insurance, tax, servicing, parking permits and MOTs, it's easy to see how such savings are achievable - and that's before you include today's dizzying fuel costs. One of the biggest financial attractions of car clubs is that many schemes include a \"free\" daily mileage allowance before you start being charged for fuel. For example, Streetcar only starts to charge 23p per mile once drivers have travelled more than 30 miles on any given \"calender day\". City Car Club charges 24p per mile after the first 50 miles each day. Both Streetcar and City Car Club charge \u00a35.95 an hour for cars such as a VW Polo or Vauxhall Astra. Under the deal, you must return the vehicle clean, with at least a quarter-full tank of fuel and to a predetermined parking bay. If you decide to put the vehicle through a car wash, some clubs will reimburse you and even give you a free hour's worth of driving credit. Beyond the cost and convenience, there are also significant environmental arguments for encouraging more people to ditch their own cars and sign up to a car club. Streetcar's Brett Akker says that independent research commissioned by his firm shows that 20 cars are effectively taken off the road for every car that's added to the club's fleet. Richard Bourn, the London spokesperson for Campaign for Better Transport, agrees that car clubs are to be encouraged: \"The evidence shows that it leads people to use cars much less than they would if they owned a car. It also makes people use their local facilities more. They are best suited to city dwellers, but outside the big cities there are small informal car clubs springing up too. What we would argue for, however, is for some of the barriers to car-club membership to be removed. To sign up, for example, you typically have to pay a \u00a350-\u00a3100 deposit which can put a lot of people off.\" Lisa de Araujo, a 47-year-old contract designer who lives in Cambridge, became a car club member last August after passing her driving test. She says that she would not now consider owning a car: \"I've never really had a need to own a car because Cambridge is such a convenient city for walking and cycling. But there's those occasions when going by car is a necessity for me. To rely on friends, or get a taxi, can be awkward especially if you have to carry lots home. I use the car about once a fortnight. It seems to be popular between 11am and 3pm on weekdays and can get busy during weekends, but I've never really had a problem so long as I book it a bit in advance.\" But even though she doesn't own the cars she uses, de Araujo can't resist giving them a name: \"The Polo I use is called 'Lolita'. The previous car was called 'Colin', but sadly he suffered a prang.\" Some car-owning habits are harder to break than others, it seems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
