Tomorrow Senol Gunes will bring the scorn of millions down on Sven-Goran Eriksson if he can pull off something else unprecedented: a win for Turkey over England. \"Expectations in a powerful football country like England are always very high,\" Gunes said, his position secure after leading Turkey to third place in the World Cup last year. \"I understand the decision might be made against the manager after the game. It's a situation faced by coaches everywhere.\" Such is the change in the world order in the past decade that the visitors are narrow favourites to beat a team who inflicted an 8-0 humiliation on them as recently as 1987. This is a good time to be facing England, and Gunes knows it. \"England will play a differ ent game against us than they did Liechtenstein, but they didn't deserve to beat the Slovaks, and we were shocked they dropped points against Macedonia,\" he pointed out. He suggested that many of the team needed to broaden their experience. \"The Premiership is one of the best leagues in the world, but England only have one member of their squad playing abroad, which means they have a lack of experience in Europe,\" he said. \"That might make for difficulties for some of the team who have not experienced different football cultures.\" Gunes obviously has some knowledge of English football, but he stopped short of offering Eriksson advice. \"It is out of my hands,\" he said. \"I will just do my best to help get a result for my team. \"A win will see us with real light at the end of the tunnel in order to qualify for Euro 2004, but a draw would not be a bad result for us either.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
