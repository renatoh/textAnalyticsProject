In an interim report into the timetable debacle, the Office of Road and Rail (ORR) singled out the train operators Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern, Network Rail and the Department for Transport (DfT) for criticism, saying their mistakes had led to the \u201ccollapse\u201d of services. The ORR chairman, Stephen Glaister, said: \u201cGood intentions and over-optimism within the rail industry about its ability to recover missed deadlines left no time to uncover and fix problems. In the event the operators were overwhelmed. They had made insufficient provision to help people in the event that things went wrong.\u201d The ORR\u2019s interim report was published as the DfT launched a \u201croot and branch\u201d review of the UK rail network. The former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams will lead an examination of Britain\u2019s rail network, which the transport minister, Chris Grayling, admitted was \u201cno longer fit to meet today\u2019s challenges\u201d. However, the DfT ruled out reversing privatisation, which it said had led to a doubling of passengers to 1.73 billion last year and record annual investment of \u00a35.6bn. The review follows a litany of rail crises, including the renationalisation of the East Coast line for the second time in 10 years, delays caused by strikes and engineering works, and a summer of misery for passengers as new timetables that took effect on 20 May caused mass cancellations across the north of England and on commuter lines into London. Glaister said Network Rail\u2019s timetable planning department did notice that a problem was developing with the May timetable changes. \u201cBut they did not take sufficient action to manage the risks or the consequences,\u201d he added. \u201cThe present industry arrangements do not support clarity of decision making: it was unclear who was responsible for what. Nobody took charge.\u201d He said there were several \u201ccritical points \u2026 where, had different decisions been taken, the subsequent disruption could have been avoided or significantly mitigated\u201d. The ORR blamed the train operators Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern for being badly prepared for the timetable changes and not doing enough to keep passengers informed of disruption. The rail regulator also criticised the DfT and itself for failing to question the industry\u2019s assurances about the risk of disruption. The ORR concluded that the rail industry had \u201cplaced engineering and planning concerns ahead of serving its passengers, and that was made worse by the poor information train operators provided when disruption happened\u201d. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, said: \u201cThey [train companies] do not employ enough drivers to run the services they promise in their franchise applications to deliver and they started driver training far too late. The DfT was, as usual, asleep at the wheel and Network Rail was behind on track enhancements.\u201d Shortly after the ORR published its report, the DfT confirmed plans for a full-scale review of Britain\u2019s railways, with the aim of introducing reforms by 2020. Grayling said: \u201cPrivatisation has delivered huge benefits of [sic] passengers on Britain\u2019s railways \u2013 doubling passenger journeys and bringing in billions of private investment. But it is clear that the structure we inherited is no longer fit to meet today\u2019s challenges and cope with increasing customer demand.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cRail passengers don\u2019t need another review from the Tories to tell them that rail is broken. Another review is meaningless in a year of rocketing fares, failing franchises and timetabling chaos. Another review lets Chris Grayling off the hook. The railways need a Labour government which will deliver public ownership of rail.\u201d The Williams review will look at \u201cbringing track and train closer together\u201d, indicating a potential overhaul of the system \u2013 introduced with the privatisation of British Rail in 1994 \u2013 under which Network Rail manages the infrastructure used by private train operating companies. The DfT said the review would look at how government \u201ceffectively balances public and private sector involvement\u201d, adding that it would consider adjusting the existing franchise model, where private firms bid to run regional routes. It will also consider ways to ensure that rail fares, set to rise by up to 3.2% next year, can achieve value for money, and seek to smooth industrial relations in the wake of a series of strikes on services operated by companies, including Southern, Northern and Merseyrail. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, called for the review to be as wide ranging as possible, examining \u201cevery part of the railway and focused on what works best for consumers and taxpayers\u201d. He said: \u201cThis review is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the wide-ranging and independent thinking our railway needs and we stand ready to play our part to make sure it delivers big, bold, meaningful reform in the national interest.\u201d The rail industry has been rocked by a series of fiascos during 2018, including the decision in May to renationalise the East Coast line on a temporary basis after the operators Virgin and Stagecoach could no longer honour the promised payments to the government in the \u00a33.3bn contract. Later the same month the introduction of new timetables led to chaotic scenes as thousands of passengers were left stranded by cancellations. The disruption, which affected passengers on the Northern and Thameslink routes particularly badly, was among the factors that led to punctuality on Britain\u2019s rail networks slumping to a 12-year low in August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
