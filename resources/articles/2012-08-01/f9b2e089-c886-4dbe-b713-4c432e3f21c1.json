But in a world where talent is hunted down and obsessively groomed so young, a world of Premier League pay cheques and corporate sponsors, it's easy to feel about the very gifted the way that F Scott Fitzgerald felt about the very rich: \"They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them\u2026\" How heartening, then, that Team GB's first golds were not grabbed by some spoilt wunderkind but by a qualified PE teacher and a Royal Artillery captain. Medals round necks, the down-to-earth rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning gave the impression that anyone could do it. It's an illusion, of course. Because the thing about ordinary Olympians is that they're not ordinary at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
