The Snow starts promisingly. In a narrative that is refreshingly direct, if free of distractions such as characters, dialogue, dramatic irony and so on, the opening pages take us at a gallop through a Wyndhamesque disaster scenario. \"The snow started falling on September 6th,\" are the first words, and the story is under way. We are in London, and as the insistent snow smothers the capital, the slide from normality to global disaster is sketched plausibly if synoptically: blizzards and snowploughs, side streets clogging up, people being stranded, difficulties obtaining food... but telephones and TV are still working, so life goes on. Gradually, though, life ceases to go on. The snowploughs grind to a halt, the drifts reach rooftop level, the phones and televisions stop working. It becomes quiet out there, with most people frozen to death and the handful of survivors staggering around using tea-trays and tennis racquets as makeshift snowshoes. Our central character, a young Asian woman named Tira, puts on her ski-jacket and snow-trousers and heads off across the roofs into Clapham, looking for other survivors. So far so good, but the problem with all disaster stories is that the story depends on events that have nothing to do with character development. To keep the reader involved, the author is really only left with two directions. The first is to go the John Wyndham route, in which survival and the re-establishment of civilised values are the main motives in a realistic-seeming set of circumstances. A recent example of this is Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow , which, for all its special effects and hints of a global catastrophe, really boils down to the story of a handful of people waiting to be rescued from a library. The other route is to use the scenario as a metaphor for something else. All the time I was reading The Snow I kept remembering Anna Kavan's 1967 novel Ice: a deep and long-lasting winter has brought social chaos, and the military intervenes to maintain order. It soon becomes clear that Kavan's book is an extended allegory about her heroin addiction. Roberts arrives at this choice of routes when Tira is rescued by a group of Americans who have set up a military society above the snow. This now lies three miles deep across the whole world, but Tira has managed to survive for a year underneath it. Sensing a change of direction, we wonder which way the story will go from here: Wyndham or Kavan? The answer is neither. Roberts closes off the realistic-seeming route by the sheer unlikeliness of his own claims. Snow three miles deep everywhere? Everywhere? That's an awful lot of snow, never mind where it came from. While Tira has been getting by on tinned food in a hole under the snow (how did she breathe?), the enterprising Americans have restored order three miles above, setting up bases and imposing the rule of law. Why neither the bases nor the rule of law sink is another evasion, but the Americans seem to have escaped from the snowy deeps with their weapons, hovercrafts, helicopters and building materials all intact. The author's offhand manner extends to his attempts to explain the snowfall. We first hear about a pseudoscientific electron sheath which \"crosses global lines of magnetic force\", and later there are suggestions that extraterrestrials are behind it all. You sense an authorial yawn is being barely suppressed: Roberts neither knows nor cares about the cause, so why should the reader? Nor is there any apparent allegorical content, other than some heavy-handed satire on repressive regimes. Tira finds herself in a society in which all documents and records are controlled. Her own story now turns out to be censored, but it's never clear why. From this point in the novel all the other characters are called \"[Blank]\" and their dialogue has been edited in the same way as the Watergate transcripts edited the cussing in the Oval Office. It hardly matters: much of the latter part of the novel consists of long passages of heavily padded rhetoric about side issues. This book shows every sign of being a hasty first draft; it does its author no credit at all and is a significant disappointment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
