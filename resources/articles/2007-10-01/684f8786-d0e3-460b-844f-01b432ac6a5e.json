Humbard, who has died aged 88, was arguably the most successful of the first wave of televangelists, which included Oral Roberts and Billy Graham. By building his church specifically for televising services, and focusing on the music that was always central to his appeal, he developed an often imitated template. His devoted audience included Elvis Presley, and Humbard officiated at the singer's funeral, making him America's closest thing to the head of an established religion. Unlike many of the later generation of television preachers, such as Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson, Humbard refrained from taking overtly political stands, or seeking political influence. \"If Jesus Christ preached today,\" he said, \"he would never get into politics.\" Humbard assiduously avoided the word \"fundamentalist\" because of its political connotations. Though, like most fund-raising televangelists, he lived an opulent lifestyle, his wealth generally interpreted by his audience as a sign of the Lord's blessing, it was his organisation's outside business interests which led to his major financial scandals. More crucially, he was not prone to the kind of sexual shenanigans that brought down Jimmy Swaggart or Jim Bakker. Humbard's moment of revelation came in Akron in 1952, when he saw people gathered outside an appliance store, watching baseball on TV. Aware that \"the vast majority of people do not go to church,\" he thought, \"if baseball on television can get their attention, so can God.\" Within a year he was broadcasting from a disused movie theatre. In 1959, he used $4m in donations to build the 5,400-seat Cathedral of Tomorrow in the Akron suburb of Cuyahoga Falls. A theatre in the round, it featured a built-in studio with five cameras, a hydraulically lifted stage, and a giant cross decorated in red, white and blue light bulbs. His services included his wife, Maude Aimee, singing gospel alongside the Cathedral Quartet. Humbard was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. His father was a Pentecostal preacher and his mother an assistant to the revivalist Mother Barnes. He grew up travelling to revival meetings, but when his father equipped all his children with musical instruments, Rex resisted performing on the guitar until he was visited by the Holy Spirit. By the age of 13, he was performing with the Humbard Singers in a travelling revival meeting called the Gospel Big Top and on a radio show out of Little Rock. He met Maude, a fellow performer, and they married in 1942. After a decade on the road, they settled in Akron, an industrial city filled with workers who had migrated from the southern Bible Belt. Humbard, who never studied divinity, had been ordained by an organisation of independent Pentecostals, but his church, then called the Calvary Temple, was always billed as non-denominational. As the Cathedral of Tomorrow boomed, Humbard invested in other businesses, including a religious college in Mackinac, Michigan, an office block in Akron and a girdle factory in Brooklyn. When he became over-extended, he relied on loans from the Teamsters Union, then run by Jimmy Hoffa, and on selling bonds to his followers. He lacked the assets to back those bonds, was prosecuted for fraud in 1972, and wound up selling off assets and using donations to pay off judgments against him. As the evangelical field grew more competitive, he faced internal dissent, partly over his lavish lifestyle, which included three aeroplanes, one of which he used to fly to Las Vegas and minister to Elvis. Embroiled in a battle with the board of his own church, Humbard sold his Ohio interests in 1982, including two TV stations and an unfinished version of London's BT Tower, complete with rotating restaurant. He moved to Florida, setting up Rex Humbard Ministries, with studios outside Palm Beach. He soon concentrated on producing home videos for direct marketing, and on personal revivals, particularly in the increasingly lucrative Latin American market. Humbard sold out football stadia in Brazil for weeks at a time. But his legal problems continued: two years ago the Internal Revenue Service fined him for failing to pay employment taxes for his Florida workers. Humbard had spent the past three years in an assisted living facility in Lantana, Florida. He wrote two autobiographies, Miracles in My Life (1971) and The Soul-Winning Century (2006). He continued recording sermons to the end. \"The more I preach, the more I want to preach,\" he said. He is survived by Maude, and four children. \u00b7 Alpha Rex Emmanuel Humbard, preacher, born August 13 1919; died September 21 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
