Well it\u2019s been another amazing afternoon. Hayley Turner broke a 32-year gap by becoming only the second woman to ride a winner at Royal Ascot when successful on Thanks Be in the Sandringham Stakes. Ryan Moore and Frankie Dettori are slugging it out for the jockeys\u2019 title at the Royal meeting and ended the final race of the day coming home first and second in a pulsating finish, with Moore coming out on top and now on five winners to Frankie\u2019s seven. It could be that the final race of the meeting tomorrow, the Queen Alexandra Stakes, decides the prize for top rider as both ride fancied mounts. I also think we saw the performance of the meeting on the track with Japan\u2019s great win in the King Edwards VII Stakes. On top of all that, the Guardian tipster Chris Cook gave five out of six winners on the day. I hope you enjoyed it \u2013 I did and I hope you can join me again here tomorrow. 1 Baghdad (R L Moore) 7-2 Fav 2 Ben Vrackie (L Dettori) 7-1 3 Fujaira Prince (Andrea Atzeni) 4-1 4 Corgi (Jim Crowley) 7-1 19 ran Non Runner: 4 And they\u2019re off ...

Turner got Charlie Fellowes\u2019 33-1 shot Thanks Be home in front by a neck from the Queen\u2019s Magnetic Charm in the Sandringham Stakes. Reflecting on her success, Turner said: \u201cThe girls\u2019 changing rooms are full now \u2013 and it was only a matter of time. Gay Kelleway was obviously the first, and great respect to her.\u201d PA Having managed to crack a leg bone in victory here last year, Baghdad has made a full recovery and was really game at Newmarket last month. That counts as a career best and his battling qualities should serve him well in this big field. Corgi was only beaten a neck by Baghdad last year but has continued to edge up the weights without winning. Byron Flyer ran a promising race at Epsom last time but is three years older than most winners of this. Fujaira Prince, beaten only by a talented rival at York, will surely be plugging on gamely up the straight. Ben Vrackie was a shade disappointing last year but his physique suggested he could do better again this summer. 1 Thanks Be (Hayley Turner) 33-1 2 Magnetic Charm (James Doyle) 7-1 3 Hotsy Totsy (J P Spencer) 7-1 4 Coral Beach (R L Moore) 10-1 27 ran Also: 11-2 Fav Desirous Non Runner: 23 Hayley Turner has become the first woman since Gay Kelleway 32 years ago to ride a winner at Royal Ascot when bringing Thanks Be through to win the Sandringham Stakes Handicap. And they\u2019re off ... Hotsy Totsy is restrained ... Maamora is leading early ... Desirous being chased along ... I\u2019m Available now leads ... Desirous picks up ... Thanks Be gets home to deny the Queen a royal winner with Magnetic Charm. Desirous is the new favourite now for the Sandringham. The bookies are running scared of Chris Cook, never mind Frankie! Rhys knows! Japan put up an even more impressive performance today in the King Edward VII Stakes when you crunch the stats. Can\u2019t wait to back it in the King George back at Ascot in July.

She looked a likely improver when winning her handicap debut at Goodwood and two of her runs in defeat as a juvenile look a lot better now that the winners have shown themselves to be Group-class. Hotsy Totsy represents the yard that won this last year and is feared. Her Kempton win suggests she is easily worth her mark of 90. Magnetic Charm, gifted to the Queen by Sheikh Mohammed, offers the real prospect of a royal success. A half-sister to a Group Three winner at Royal Ascot, she battled well to win a Listed race on her reappearance and her rating looks on the lenient side. It\u2019s odd to see John Gosden run four without using Frankie Dettori; perhaps the Italian was unable to do the weight of 8st 7lbs for Nonchalance, to be partnered by Rab Havlin. Guardian tipster Chris Cook has done a Frankie! He has had the first four winners today and if he has the last two, colleague Barry Glendenning will be retiring, which will be bad news for the Football Podcast fans but good news for him. 1 Watch Me (P C Boudot) 20-1 2 Hermosa (R L Moore) Evens Fav 3 Jubiloso (James McDonald) 9-2 9 ran Also: 7-1 Twist \u2018n\u2019 Shake 4th Non Runner: 7 And they\u2019re off ...

Here comes Twist \u2018N\u2019 Shake but Watch Me goes clear and is going to win. John Hunt with an interesting point about the final race of the meeting tomorrow. Frankie Dettori has now matched his best total of winners, seven, which came back in 1998. Here he is winning the Gold Cup in that year: It\u2019s now good ground on the straight course; good to soft on the round course. Hermosa \u2013 1/1 Jubiloso \u2013 13/2 Castle Lady \u2013 15/2 Twist n Shake \u2013 12/1 Pretty Pollyanna \u2013 14/1 Watch Me \u2013 16/1 Happen \u2013 20/1 Just Wonderful \u2013 28/1 Main Edition \u2013 50/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Guardian tipster Chris Cook is in nearly as good form as Frankie this week and has had the first three winners today. It\u2019s Watch Me in the next. Come on my son ... er daughter! Hermosa seeks to complete the Guineas/Irish Guineas/Coronation Stakes hat-trick that was achieved by her stablemate Winter just two years ago, and there is every reason to expect a big run from Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s likeable filly. But the opposition here looks a step up on what she\u2019s faced and the available odds take little account of that. Castle Lady, the unbeaten French Guineas winner, is a big danger while, at 14-1, there could be plenty of value in Watch Me from the Francis Graffard yard that won Sunday\u2019s French Oaks. Watch Me didn\u2019t look comfortable on the heavy going and met trouble in running on the way to being sixth in the French Guineas, but she has a lot of speed and can be seen to better effect on this ground. Jubiloso is out of Frankel\u2019s half-sister and has easily won a maiden and a novice race, but this is another level altogether. That is the seventh winner of the meeting for the irrepressible Frankie Dettori and that may have clinched the jockey of the meeting title for the Italian. He leads Ryan Moore by seven to four. He\u2019s kissed the camera, the owner of Advertise and the trainer. Long may he stay riding. 1 Advertise (L Dettori) 8-1 2 Forever In Dreams (Oisin Murphy) 20-1 3 Hello Youmzain (Kevin Stott) 6-1 9 ran And they\u2019re off ... Royal Intervention is out fast with Ten Sovereigns in fourth early ... Forever In Dreams is prominent ... Ten Sovereigns is under pressure ... Advertise has the lead ... and it\u2019s Frankie again ... Advertise wins! Frankie Dettori has been talking about his runners tomorrow if you want to get primed for the action on the final day. This is what he said on his latest Ladbrokes blog. \u201cRose Of Kildare is a little bit of an outsider in the Chesham Stakes (2.30), but I don\u2019t know much about her to be honest. In the Jersey Stakes (3.05) I ride Maries Diamond but again he is an outsider. There are better horses in the race. I think Lah Ti Dar could run a big race in the Hardwicke Stakes (3.40). She will like the track and was second in the Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes. In the Diamond Jubilee Stakes (4.20), I ride Emblazoned. It will be a big ask but I hope we can get him placed. In the Wokingham (5pm), I am on one of the favourites in Danzeno. He likes Ascot. I was third in the QIPCO Sprint so he is a good horse on his day. My final ride of the meeting is on Corelli in the Queen Alexandra Stakes (5.35). It is two miles and five furlongs and he has never run that far so who knows. Hopefully if I get one winner, it will be an amazing day.\u201d Ten Sovereigns \u2013 5/4 Jash \u2013 5/1 Advertise \u2013 7/1 Khadeem \u2013 15/2 Hello Youmzain \u2013 8/1 Rumble Inthejungle \u2013 25/1 Forever in Dreams \u2013 33/1 Koncheck \u2013 66/1 Royal Intervention \u2013 66/1 Full Oddschecker betting here Ten Sovereigns\u2019s Middle Park win is the best bit of form and he can be forgiven his non-staying effort in the Guineas. But he was evidently primed to the minute, judging by the support that came for him, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how much he has left to offer here. Odds of 11-8 are very short about a horse that hasn\u2019t won since September. Jash has a big chance but the overpriced one could be Advertise, who failed to run his race in the Guineas when his stable was out of sorts. A close second to Calyx here last year, he has some excellent six-furlong form and the blinkers could make a difference. Hello Youmzain profited when Calyx failed to give his running at Haydock recently. The winner of two Group Twos, he faces much stiffer opposition here. Japan looked a class act there and has obviously come to himself after a poor run in the Dante and a much more promising one in the Derby. Immediately after some were suggesting the St Leger but Ryan Moore suggests he\u2019s better than that. The King George at Ascot in late July looks tailor-made for the Aidan O\u2019Brien runner. 1 Japan (R L Moore) 6-4 Fav 2 Bangkok (S De Sousa) 10-1 3 Eagles By Day (D Tudhope) 25-1 8 ran And they\u2019re off ... Humanitarian is up there but Jack Yeats takes the lead and sets a good piece for stable companion Japan, who is held up towards the rear ... Pondus is now in second ... Bangkok is last ... Japan makes a move but is very wide ... Bangkok makes a good move ... Japan comes down the wide outside and looks a class apart, winning with ease under Ryan Moore, now on four winners for the week. Japan, favourite for the King Edward VII Stakes, is the best-backed horse of the week, one rails bookmaker reporting on wager of \u00a3200,000 at 5-4. The horse just kicked the owner\u2019s hat and damaged it! Japan \u2013 11/8 Pondus \u2013 9/2 Private Security \u2013 5/1 Pablo Escobar \u2013 9/1 Bangkok \u2013 14/1 Humanitarian \u2013 14/1 Jack Yeats \u2013 33/1 Eagles by Day \u2013 40/1 Full betting at Oddschecker Ground just on the soft side ... In just a few more strides, Japan would have won the Derby, so strong was he finishing up the middle of the track. After a troubled preparation and a disappointing effort in his prep run, that was a terrific effort. Aidan O\u2019Brien was under no pressure to bring him here with the Irish Derby on the horizon, so he is presumably confident the horse is ready to go again and Japan looks the standout talent on show. One concern is that O\u2019Brien has only won this race once and that was 15 years ago, which seems surprising in view of how often he would have suitable horses. Bangkok boiled over before the Derby and reportedly failed to handle the track. His temperament will again be tested here but, if calmer, he undoubtedly has enough talent to win, so he is overpriced at 16-1. It\u2019s worrying that the market has allowed him to double in price. Private Secretary was briefly considered for the Derby but was felt not to be ready for the Classic. This is a serious test of John Gosden\u2019s son of Kingman, unbeaten in three this year at a lower level. He doesn\u2019t do anything quickly. Pondus takes a huge step up in class from the Sandown novice race he won easily last time. The best of his siblings won a handicap while rated 88. 1 Daahyeh (David Egan) 4-1 Fav 2 Celtic Beauty (W J Lee) 25-1 3 Aroha (Harry Bentley) 100-1 25 ran Also: 50-1 Alabama Whitman 4th Non Runner: 21 And they\u2019re off ...

Frankie Dettori has been reflecting on the four-timer he achieved at Royal Ascot yesterday, including Stradivarius in the Gold Cup. Interviewed on Sky Sports Racing, he compared it to his Magnificent Seven, achieved 23 years ago at Ascot, but at the September meeting. Dettori said: \u201cI could feel the people getting behind me and everybody wanted Stradivarius to win \u2013 it was magical. I can\u2019t lie, I was nervous before the race, but the Gold Cup went to plan. I had a good spot and looking at the replay I know why people were worried, but I thought I was fine as I knew everything that was going on! When I crossed the line, everyone went mad \u2013 it was great. I haven\u2019t experienced anything like it at Royal Ascot. We got over 66,000 people here yesterday and a lot of them won\u2019t know much about racing, but they got to experience something really special. To see a gutsy performance from Stradivarius is good for the sport and I was so pleased to be a part of it. \u201cStradivarius has become the people\u2019s favourite. His style of racing and the way he conducts himself is marvellous. He has a tremendous will to win and it is so obvious for people to see. It is a privilege for me to ride him obviously, for people in the grandstand and people at home, it is magical to see a horse like that \u2013 Stradivarius is a wonderful horse. Stradivarius is so tiny and they dwarf him! His heart is bigger than his body. The Magnificent Seven was special, but it was such a long time ago I forgot about it! Yesterday was so special and I could feel everything. After the Magnificent Seven, this is my second biggest day \u2013 I cannot put it into words.\u201d Daahyeh \u2013 9/2 Nayibeth \u2013 8/1 Last Surprise - 13/2 Galadriel \u2013 11/1 JM Jackson \u2013 12/1 Precious Moments \u2013 14/1 Silent Wave \u2013 14/1 So Wonderful \u2013 14/1 Lil Grey \u2013 20/1 Exceptional \u2013 25/1 Chili Petin \u2013 25/1 Kemble \u2013 28/1 Exclusively \u2013 33/1 Celtic Beauty \u2013 28/1 Moon of Love \u2013 33/1 Separate \u2013 40/1 Back to Brussels \u2013 50/1 Seraphinite \u2013 100/1 Alabama Whitman \u2013 66/1 Graceful Magic \u2013 125/1 Fleeting Princess \u2013 150/1 Lorelei Rock \u2013 80/1 Dilligent Dab \u2013 125/1 Aroha \u2013 200/1 Get the Look \u2013 250/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here The Guardian sent its wealth correspondent Rupert Neate to the Goffs Sale earlier this week. \u201cWe\u2019re attracting wealthy people from around the world. It\u2019s called the sport of kings for a reason,\u201d said Goff\u2019s chief executive Henry Beeby. The well-related Nayibeth comes from the US with a big reputation but Wesley Ward\u2019s juvenile winners here have been in shorter races and she could struggle to last home with some moisture still in the ground. The suggested alternative is Daahyeh, from the stable that won this five years ago. She impressed on her Newmarket debut, beating Raffle Prize, the Queen Mary winner here on Wednesday. From the same stable that won Thursday\u2019s Norfolk Stakes, Last Surprise was an easy winner over an experienced, well-fancied rival at Lingfield. Jm Jackson is winless but got close to two classy rivals in running second on both starts so far, notably when beaten by the Norfolk Stakes runner-up on her debut. 1st Pink 5-4 The bookies at the track are still betting on the Queen\u2019s hat ... look at those odds!

Dame Annabel Whitehead Major Nana Twumasi-Ankrah I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallinger back in 1994 when one of his installations, called \u2018Royal Ascot\u2019, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage\u2019s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: \u2018Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen\u2019s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen\u2019s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol\u2019s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his \u2018Reigning Queens\u2019 series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.\u2019 The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year\u2019s Royal Procession on the Friday \u2013 see if you can spot the difference. Frankie Dettori joked that Ascot \u201cmight need to get another statue\u201d after winning the first four races yesterday. It might be a blessing as the one near the entrance to Ascot\u2019s Royal enclosure to mark his astonishing day in 1996 is not regarded as the finest example in a crowded field of bad statues of sportsmen. The day the statue was unveiled I remember standing next to Racing Post scribe Alastair Down, who opined: \u201cIt looks as if Frankie\u2019s had a dose of senna pods!\u201d Yesterday was one of the best day\u2019s racing in recent memory and Frankie Dettori\u2019s exploits certainly helped put bums on sofas. ITV Racing spokesman Liz Ampairee reported this morning: \u201cFollowing on from very strong viewing figures in the first two days of Royal Ascot 2019, Frankie Dettori\u2019s \u2018fabulous four\u2019 ensured that Day Three produced the highest peak viewing figures for any day at Royal Ascot for seven years, with 1.4 million people watching ITV Racing.\u201d It could be argued that Frankie Dettori\u2019s best ride yesterday was on a horse he lost on, doing brilliantly to get Turgenev (a horse who should have gone off a 14-1 shot but which started the 7-2 favourite) so close to winning the Britannia Stakes. The Italian dominated the race from the start on his mount and and almost pulled off what would have been an historic fifth straight win on the day. If that had come off everyone would then have been willing the jockey to ride all six winners but it became clear early in the final race that his mount, Questionare, had not read the script and was not fully co-operating with his rider. Questionare ran so poorly that the stewards asked questions and it would seem that the horse faces a fate far worse than that of Frankie! For the first time this week I wasn\u2019t sent any odds in advance for the colour of the Queen\u2019s hat today and it\u2019s now clear the best-known novelty betting market at Royal Ascot is in peril. Ladbrokes have suspended betting indefinitely with spokesperson Nicola McGeady stating this morning: \u201cWe are no longer betting on the colour of the Queen\u2019s hat this week. After the gamble was landed yesterday it\u2019s obvious someone knew something we don\u2019t so betting has been suspended for now.\u201d Rupert Adams of William Hill told me that his firm had been offering 1-2 Blue and 5-4 Pink with all layers now seemingly running scared of getting involved. A spokesperson from Bookmakers.tv said: \u201cAny profits made from the worst set of hat results for punters in recent memory were quickly eviscerated by Frankie Dettori on Ladies\u2019 day and the major firms have taken an even more cautious approach, with nearly every major bookmaker\u2019s odds suspended by 9am this morning, but following yesterday\u2019s antics, it\u2019s easy to forgive traders for having less time to price up the Friday hat market. \u201cSome overnight prices incredibly suggest another blue number is favourite, which would be a huge deviation from the form book. Pink, which looks a certainty to make an appearance at every meeting is next and should prove a popular pick on course with better weather forecast. \u201cRacegoers who want to participate in the Ascot tradition are urged to place bets with an off-course bookmaker before arriving, thanks to some of the colossal overrounds on display in the betting ring, although based on the lack of price sensitivity shown by trackside hat punters and the thin competition, the bookies are within their rights to try and recoup some of the Frankie losses any way they can.\u201d Frankie Dettori 6 wins Ryan Moore 3 Danny Tudhope 3 Jim Crowley 1 Oisin Murphy 1 James Doyle 1 Richard Kingscote 1 Harry Bentley 1 Seamie Heffernan 1 This is Frankie\u2019s place and he proved it with his four-timer yesterday, which looked for all the world like a five-timer in the making for a few seconds. Moore\u2019s week started so well but has had plenty of difficult moments in the last two days. Bookmakers closed the book on top jockey after Tuesday but reopened it last night with Dettori at 8-15 and Moore 11-8. Silvestre De Sousa can\u2019t have been enjoying it, with three second places the best he has to show for some fancied rides. Tudhope, who was in Yorkshire yesterday, is back for a single ride today, on the unfancied Eagles By Day in the 3.05. Here\u2019s an excellent piece by colleague Ben Fisher on Jay Tabb, the former Coventry and Reading player who is training to work in racing and has a ride at the Cheltenham Festival in his sights. He starts work at Philip Hobbs\u2019 yard later thins month. 2.30pm Albany Stakes 21 PAPER STAR (Self Certificate, Not Eaten Up) 4.20pm Coronation Stakes 7 MOT JUSTE (Going) 5.00pm Sandringham Handicap 23 GALLIC (Going) 5.35pm Duke of Edinburgh Handicap 4 SEA THE LION (Vet\u2019s Certificate, Bruised Foot) The official going for the fourth day of Royal Ascot remains: Straight Course: Good to Soft Round Course: Good to Soft, Soft in places GoingStick readings at 8.15am today: Stand side: 7.4, Centre: 7.6, Far Side: 7.4.

Temperatures for the remainder of the week are predicted to be between 19 and 22 degrees Celsius. Looking ahead to racing this afternoon and through to Saturday, Ascot\u2019s clerk of the Course Chris Stickels is expecting the weather to remain dry, the going to quicken up with the possibility of a going change later today. He said at 8.30am today: \u201cWe have a dry sunny day forecast so I expect a change in the going later to reflect that. A great forecast for tomorrow as well.

In fact, his 80th winner had been Crystal Ocean the day before and he was now on 81, but we don\u2019t quibble over details. O\u2019Brien is now one away from his 70th success here and one imagines he will be bearing down on Stoute\u2019s mark soon enough. Gosden got off the mark for the week in fine style with his Thursday double and the big beasts of Newmarket are faring very well once more. Roger Varian is one of the bigger names missing from that list and I hope he can rectify the matter in today\u2019s first race. Richard Hannon is 0/12 and will be rueing his near miss in the Coventry with Threat. You want to know what\u2019s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the fourth day. Stay here and we\u2019ll have an in-depth preview for every race as the afternoon goes on. 2.30 Albany Stakes Daahyeh 4-1 3.05 King Edward VII Stakes Japan Evens 3.40 Commonwealth Cup Advertise 8-1 4.20 Coronation Stakes Watch Me (nb) 14-1 5.00 Sandringham Fillies\u2019 Handicap Desirous 13-2 5.35 Duke of Edinburgh Handicap Baghdad (nap) 5-1 Every one of these is shortening as I type, which makes a pleasant change from yesterday\u2019s 40-1 shot that drifted to 66s and ran like it didn\u2019t fancy itself much. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t take much seeing that Advertise and Watch Me were the interesting outsiders in their races, since both feature unusually small fields. I dare say winner-finding will still prove as tricky as it always is here... You could win a \u00a350 account credit from Ladbrokes Coral by proving your tipping prowess on today\u2019s races. All you have to do is give us your selections for all of today\u2019s races at Ascot. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price. Non-runners count as losers. Please post all your tips in a single posting, using the comment facility below, before the first race at 2.30pm. There are six races at Ascot today and you must post a single selection for each race. Our usual terms and conditions, which you can read here will apply, except that this will be a strictly one-day thing. If we get a tie after all the races have been run, the winner will be the one who posted their tips earliest out of those with the highest score. Thanks for playing our competition this week! This is our final day running the Ascot competition. We\u2019ll return with more competitions for the Cheltenham Festival in March. The heartiest congratulations seem scant reward for JimmyDeuce, who put up one of the best tipping performances I\u2019ve ever seen yesterday. Somehow he found Biometric (28-1), South Pacific (22-1), Sangarius (13-2) and Star Catcher (4-1) for a score of +58.50, more than twice what anyone else could do. Very well done, sir, and I hope you\u2019re a lot richer. Please post your tips or racing-related comments below. What do Michael Kinane, Jamie Spencer, Jimmy Fortune and Johnny Murtagh have in common? They have all won the award for the top jockey at Royal Ascot since Frankie Dettori picked up the last of his five riding titles at this meeting way back in 2004. After the day that Dettori had here on Thursday, it seems difficult to believe. In the first four races, there was not a stride out of place as the most famous name in the game racked up a 449-1 four-timer. He is also, and by an increased margin thanks to his exploits this week, the most successful current rider at the meeting, leading Ryan Moore by 66 winners to 56. Spencer, who is next on the list of current riders, has 23. But as well as his considerable talent, this is also a testament to Dettori\u2019s durability. His first winner at Royal Ascot came in 1990. Moore\u2019s arrived 18 years later. Dettori has been consistently top-class at Ascot for nearly three decades, while only rarely enjoying the kind of week that puts a rider at the top of the pile. Even now, after an afternoon that few who were there to absorb the crackling atmosphere will ever forget, Dettori is not assured of his first jockeys\u2019 title at the Royal meeting for 15 years. His total of six winners for the week gives him a healthy lead over Ryan Moore, who has three, but the bookies rate him only a 4-7 chance, with Moore on 11-8, when you might expect Dettori to be long odds-on. Today\u2019s card at Ascot could make all the difference. Dettori has rides in five of the six races, while Moore has a full book of six. In terms of quality, though, Moore is, on paper, streets ahead. Three of his rides are certain to start favourite, probably at 6-4 or shorter, while the best of Dettori\u2019s partners appears to be Private Secretary, the 4-1 second favourite behind Moore\u2019s ride Japan, in the King Edward VII Stakes, the second race on the card. A win for Dettori there would be a huge setback for Moore, who is ahead on a \u201ccountback\u201d of placed efforts and so needs only to draw level with his rival to win. Elsewhere on the card, it may take a little more of the Dettori magic that was so evident yesterday if Advertise (who faces the Moore-ridden favourite Ten Sovereigns in the Commonwealth Cup) or Twist \u2018N\u2019 Shake, around 12-1 to beat the dual Guineas winner Hermosa in the Coronation Stakes, is to extend his lead. One more winner, incidentally, would equal Dettori\u2019s personal record at the meeting, when he rode seven winners in 1998. Weather-wise, the prospects look excellent for Ascot today, with highs in the low 20s and no rain at all in the forecast. It has been dry at the track since Wednesday evening, but Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, reported this morning that the going is still good-to-soft on the straight course and good-to-soft, soft in places on the round course. Stickels does expect that to change as the day goes on, however. \u201cWe have a sunny day forecast, so I do expect a change in the going later to reflect that. A great forecast for tomorrow too. A dry, sunny day, so we should see the ground quicken up a little bit.\u201d Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the fourth day, including a 16-1 chance in the Coronation Stakes, are here, and all the news and more will be live here as the day unfolds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
