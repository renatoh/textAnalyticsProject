What tales emerge when people journey from one place to another, one kind of life to another, one identity to another? What happens when we travel across borders? As identities shift, and boundaries are questioned or defended, now is the time to explore migration stories. Inspiration and metaphor spring readily from the contrasts between different worlds. Transitions generate plot. Perhaps migration - physical, emotional, spiritual, conceptual - is at the heart of all storytelling. Drawing on more than 20 years of writing and teaching, award-winning author Elise Valmorbida leads this practical one-day workshop to explore storytelling (fiction or nonfiction) with particular emphasis on language, memory, character and place. Through discussion, writing exercises and supportive critical feedback, you will learn how to write about migration - your own or others\u2019 - and how to bring ideas to life on the page. You\u2019ll approach creative writing with a fresh sense of confidence and direction. Course content Fiction/nonfiction about, or inspired by, migration Shaping material into compelling narrative forms Understanding new aspects of writing craft and content Group discussion and feedback on ideas Literary criticism Writing exercises Assignments and information to take away Tutor profile Elise Valmorbida grew up Italian in Australia, but fell in love with London.
