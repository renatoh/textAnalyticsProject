On the face of it, this should be fairly straightforward. Arsenal and Wigan have only played each other five times in the league; Arsenal have won all of them. Wigan's sole victory against the Gunners was in the Carling Cup two years ago, but that was against a team with a defence made up of Kerea Gilbert, Philippe Senderos, Johan Djourou and Pascal Cygan. All very good pros in their own way, of course. However, sniffing the air - and sniffing it really hard - there might just be the tiniest hint of a whiff of a mild and not entirely unpleasant odour of something else today. Maybe. Wigan have won their last two home games without conceding a goal (note: beating Derby still counts under Premier League rules). Arsenal have won just once in their last five (note: OK, it was away to AC Milan and only last week). Steve Bruce has a fully fit squad. Arsenal, on the other hand, are a bit lacking up front, what with Theo Walcott and Eduardo out, although Robin Van Persie could be back. So you never know (note: yes, I know, you generally do). Either way, a win would extend Arsenal's lead over Man Utd to four points and leave Steve Bruce fidgeting and pointing on the sidelines looking, as ever, like a really grumpy middle-aged dinner lady. A draw would shift Wigan up to 13th and result in Arsene Wenger making a lengthy and impassioned complaint about somebody else whose fault it all really is. And we might get to see William Gallas going off on one again and making a really sad face because he's \"a winner\". Oh dear. Just got a look at the pitch. It's terrible. There's no grass on it. And there are Rugby League markings all over it. Arsene's not going to like it. And quite right too. It is absolutely hopeless. Our teams today: Wigan: Kirkland, Melchiot, Scharner, Boyce, Edman, Valencia, Brown, Palacios, Koumas, Heskey, King. Subs: Pollitt, Taylor, Sibierski, Kilbane, Bramble. Arsenal: Almunia, Sagna, Senderos, Gallas, Clichy, Fabregas, Flamini, Silva, Hleb, Adebayor, Bendtner. Subs: Lehmann, Toure, Van Persie, Song Billong, Justin Hoyte. Referee: Rob Styles (Hampshire) So, Bendtner starts against his former boss at Birmingham. Van Persie ready to make his comeback from the bench. Fabregas will play towards the right side. Gilberto and Flamini in the middle. Heskey and King could do a decent job on the door at the New Cross Venue if they ever get bored of flailing about up front for the Latics. But wait! Gary Naylor says \"the best single performance last season was Emile Heskey's extraordinary tour-de-force in Wigan's do-or-die game v Sheffield United. It's hard to overstate just how good he was that day, in attack and defence. Half of that this afternoon and Wigan will get something\". Is he right? Or is he insane? By the way, Wigan's outfield players have seven goals between them. Scharner's got four of them. 1 min: They're off!! Arsenal start the game and immediately pop it about it about on the horribly gluey surface. 1 mins: Golly! Adebayor sprints straight through the middle of the Wigan defence and is only foiled by a brilliant save by Kirkland rushing out to meet him on the edge of the box. Could, and probably should, have been 1-0. 3 mins: Arsenal free kick swung into the box by Fabregas. Goes out for a goal kick. They've started in a hurry. 5 mins: Adebayor almost scores again. Surging run from left to right, plays a one-two with Bendtner. Great block by Melchiot. Wigan have already hurled one long throw into the box here. Steve Bruce has turned them into a genuine long ball team this season. An interesting, hem hem, \"clash of styles\" in the offing. 7 mins: Failed Arsenal trialist Palacios shanks a shot high over the bar from 30 yards. Curses. I'll show you M. Wenger. 9 mins: Arsenal keep the ball for about 30 passes but eventually forced to pass back to Almunia by some good chasing. Applause all round. 10 mins: Arsenal corner after Bendtner's shot is deflected just wide with Kirkland scrambling. Headed clear by Melchiot. Clichy shoots well wide. No goals for him yet for Arsenal. 12 mins: Arsenal look very comfortable, despite the re-jigged midfield. Fabregas still very much, as Andy Gray says \"the puppet-master\" 13 mins: Lovely move by Wigan. Perfectly weighted long pass by Koumas out to Valencia, laid inside to Palacios, who shoots wide. Decent opening. Nothing wrong with that kind of long ball. 16 mins: Lovely pass by Fabregas down the channel, Bendtner picks it up and steams in on goal, but the ball takes a horrible bobble and he performs a textbook air shot. Stop sniggering Adebayor. Andy Gray calls Fabregas \"the little Spanish magician\". 18 mins: Arsenal play some intricate 5-a-side in Wigan's area and attempt to score from three inches. Hacked clear. 19 mins: Valencia and Clichy are having a right old ding-dong on the Wigan right. Valencia wins a corner but the delivery is poor and Arsenal clear. He looks like the only Wigan attacker with some real pace. 22 mins: Fabregas flights a pass through to Bendtner, who skips away from Edman and crosses low. Put behind for a corner. Bounces about inside the six yard box, but eventually cleared. Bendtner looks a bit lively today. 24 mins: Does anyone else ever get the feeling Andy Gray's \"punditry\" is in fact patched together by a computer from a file of his favourite phrases. \"It's been that kind of season\". \"They need to get to the ball quicker\". etc etc 26 mins: So lively in fact that he's booked (Bendtner) for a tackle on Koumas on the touchline. Replays show it was pretty clean. 27 mins: Valencia wins another corner with some \"old-fashioned\" wing play. Good defending from Coronation Street's Gael. Stayed on his feet. Corner cleared. 30 mins: Bendtner and Adebayor not really dovetailing up front for Arsenal. In fact Adebayor has pretty much disappeared in the last 15 minutes. Maybe they should sort it out here and now. 31 mins: Bendtner skins Boyce and puts in a low cross but it's cleared, Nice work. But Arsenal still not really up to much yet. 32 mins: Re: Andy Gray Niall Harden suggests \"switch him off - hit the red button and enter fanzone. it's great - two lads just yelling \"get in!\" and \"get 'im!\" ad nauseam.\" Yes, but how would we know that \"they need to up the tempo\" if we did that? 34 mins: Koumas swings in a Wigan free kick from a decent position with loads of their giant players forward but Clichy clears. Waste, that. 36 mins: Lovely spell of swift passing ends with Fabregas heading Clichy's cross goalward. Kirkland makes a good scrambling save. Fred Lane asks \"are you suggesting that Andy Gray is the only pundit around who is a catalogue of hackneyed phrases?\" No. But he's the one who sounds most like an endlessly repeating computer programme. Along with Alan Hansen of course. And Graeme Souness. 38 mins: Bit of argy-bargy between Heskey and Fabregas. Ha! It all started because Heskey clattered him a bit. Fabregas crashed into a camera man and then Heskey did a weak pretend head butt which left \"the magician\" cwutching his ickle cheek becos it made a hurt. Get on with it. 41 mins: Bit of decent Wigan pressure. A few long throws. Valencia crosses but drifts behind. The home crowd are quite noisy considering there are only 30-odd of them. 43 mins: Wigan are well up for this. They've worked very hard closing down all over the pitch. Can they keep it up for 90 minutes though? Particularly on this funny pitch. 45 mins: Heskey bursts away with the ball into the Arsenal box. Great tackle by Gallas sends it out for a corner. He's hurt himself a bit, the skipper. 45+1 mins: Corner comes to nothing and that's half time. Best chance of the half came in the opening minute. Overall Brucie's masterplan seems to be working. I'll be back after a quick breath of dank Clerkenwell air. Ian Copestake wants me to \"emulate the German example and refer to Arsenal as \"Arsenal-London.\" I am hoping it will catch on so that worldwide the Toffees will be known as \"Everton-Liverpool.\"\" Er, OK then. Frustrating half for Arsenal. I wonder if/when Wenger will change things. There's only really Van Persie from an attacking point of view. Alternatively, if he has a hairdryer in his repertoire, he'll probably be firing it up right now. 46 mins: Wigan kick off and hoof it forward. Arsenal-London play it back to Almunia who hurls it out. Happy now? 48 mins: King and Senderos having a massive wrestling match on the edge of the Arsenal box. That was up there with Haye v Maccarinelli. Lasted about as long too. 49 mins: Another good save from Kirkland, who's left in no man's land by Scharner intercepting along pass he'd come for. To be honest Adebayor should have done better. He looks a bit off it. 50 mins: More good pressure from Arsenal. Brown scrambles it clear. Probably their best spell of the match. 52 mins: Oh dear. Gary Naylor says \"Re Arsenal-London, can I save the Red noses the trouble of writing in by saying that any name change will take some time to ratify and therefore it's easier for the Toffees to propose \"Everton-Kirkby\".\" Calm down, calm down. Enough of that. I knew it was a mistake. 53 mins: Game settled back into the same old tight battle. Flamini and Brown have a little nibble at each other. Flamini Does European-style \"you are crazy man!\" hand gestures. 55 mins: Heskey's hobbled off. No chance to add to his one goal (in August) this season. Sibierski on to complete the shaven-headed bouncers double-act up front. 57 mins: He he he. Almunia rushes out to clear a long pass and collides spectacularly with Gallas. Loud cheers. Everybody's OK thankfully. 59 mins: But Wigan do, briefly. Sibierski finds Koumas whose shot is deflected wide. Almunia flaps it away but put back in and headed over by Sagna for another. Cleared again. Hard work for Arsenal, this. Arsenal are up against a determined and well-organised side today. As it stands they don't look like scoring. 61 mins: Wigan lumping it in there to good effect. Sibierski has added something. Mainly a big bald head to aim for. Gilberto booked for hacking down Palacios. Bit of a cynical challenge stopping a break. 63 mins: All Wigan right now, in terms of possession and territory. Arsenal are definitely finding it hard to pop the ball around quickly on this swamp. 64 mins: Fierce shot by Valencia from the corner of the box. Almunia palms it away in show-off style. Then punches it away from the corner. Van Persie's coming on. But for who? 65 mins: Bendtner and Gilberto off. Toure and Van Persie on. Toure is playing wide on the right. Eh? Well, Fabregas is in the middle now. 67 mins: Well, it's different. And who are we to quibble? He did used to play in midfield. , but on the left. And some years ago. 68 mins: Wigan still looking to attack and having most of the ball. King has run around a lot today. 70 mins: Gallas is limping with what looks like foot-knack. Could it be Kolo only gets two minutes on the wing? 71 mins: Arsenal have looked less and less like scoring as this has gone on. Where's all the beautiful football gone? This is tight, tight, tight. But, to be fair ,not being played on a proper modern football pitch. King booked for a lunge on Fabregas. 72 mins: Lovely ball in from Fabregas from the free kick, drifts right through the crowd to Kirkland who clutches it. This would be Arsenal's third league draw in a row. 74 mins: Van Persie rolls about on the floor for a bit because someone's finger caught him on the cheek. Phew. You wouldn't wish another injury on him. Or anyone for that matter. 76 mins: Arsenal free kick in a decent position. Sibierski booked for complaining. Van Persie to take. Could this be a dream comeback? 77 mins: No. He blasts a rising shot well over the bar. At least it was a shot somewhere near goal. 80 mins: Toure jinks - yes, jinks - down the right wing and finds Sagna in miles of space. His ball in isn't very good, but Boyce concedes a corner. Well delivered by Van Persie. Cleared. Another one. 81 mins: Caught by Kirkland this time. Apparently he wants to be a fireman when he retires. Very nice too. Except you have to be under 35. They wouldn't have David James. 83 mins: The home fans are loving this. Arsenal, on the other hand, look a bit frantic. Van Persie makes some space cleverly, but blasts the ball absolutely miles over the bar with his left foot. 85 mins: Valencia puts a nice ball into the box, Sibierski attacks it but Gallas is there first and it's a corner. Koumas takes it but it's headed away by Senderos. 86 mins: Fabregas scuffs a shot wide. Not been his best day. Van Persie has looked like Arsenal's best hope since he came on. 88 mins: Kilbane comes on for King. He's marking right-winger Toure. 89 mins: Lots of scurrying from Arsenal, but they still can't create any proper chances. They're not enjoying this game. 90+2 mins: Lots of scurrying from both teams, but still not much doing around goal. 90+3 mins: Late pressure from Wigan. Valencia skins Clichy and fires it in. Fabregas shanks it just over his own bar. That was close. From the corner Koumas has a fierce shot charged down. All Wigan at the end. 90 mins: But wait! Best chance of the game. Adebayor plays Fabregas in nicely. Lovely run, right through on Kirkland. the keeper \"makes himself big\" and saves. He might have been able to square it. Four mins of extra time. 90+4 mins: Full time A third consecutive league draw for Arsenal. Good performance from Wigan who worked very hard. Terrible pitch but not really an excuse for a limp showing. Still, it leaves them two points clear at the top, so not all bad. That's all from me for now. Thanks for all your emails and I hope you enjoyed the commentary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
