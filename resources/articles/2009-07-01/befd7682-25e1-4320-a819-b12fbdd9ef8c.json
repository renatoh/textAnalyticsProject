You can tell that from their collective demeanour, which has shifted from mild disinterest to something approaching mild hysteria: suddenly, there seems to be an awful lot of nudging and pointing and frantic, whispered conversation in which the phrase \"Oh my God\" figures heavily. Seated at a nearby table, nursing a bottle of water, clad, as ever, in a T-shirt bearing the title of his debut album Star In The Hood, the object of their affections raises an eyebrow and smiles. \"I think they've seen me, innit?\" Twenty-two- year-old Kwasi Danquah \u2013 better known to his increasingly agitated female admirers as Tinchy Stryder \u2013 is Britain's hottest new rapper, whose two most recent singles, Take Me Back and Number 1, reached number three and, appropriately enough, number one in the charts. He offers a noncommittal wave and nod in their direction, then returns his attention to his conversation with the Liberal Democrat shadow health secretary, Norman Lamb, who, as Liberal Democrat shadow health secretaries go, seems enormously well informed about British rap. \"My mother,\" he announces, \"is the only 90-year-old in Britain with a poster of Lethal Bizzle in her kitchen.\" Tinchy Stryder (\"Tinchy\" because of his diminutive height) is a cool customer. The first time I meet him is at the filming of a BBC Radio 3 music show, for which he is required to perform his forthcoming single, Never Leave You, in the middle of Spitalfields market, east London. It's a Friday lunchtime and the makeshift audience includes a tantrumming toddler and some Belgian tourists loudly eating crisps. The director made him do the song three times, but Stryder just carried on, as if rapping in the middle of Spitalfields was an everyday occurrence. He has attempted to show me around the campus of the University of East London, where, until a few weeks ago, he contrived to combine his burgeoning musical career with a degree in digital arts and the moving image: \"You can push back an album's release date, but uni coursework deadlines, they don't change, man,\" he says a little wearily. As soon as Stryder walked into the entrance he was mobbed: another school trip. \"It's not like that usually,\" he frowns. \"The other students, they're more like, 'Why do you even come here? If I was you, I'd never come here, man.' But even when I was number three in the charts, I still came to uni.\" There is no escaping the fact that the situation in which Stryder finds himself is deeply incongruous. Lamb, the MP for North Norfolk since 2001, is not the first parliamentarian to invite a rapper to the Commons, nor is he the first MP to express an opinion about British hip-hop: there was the former culture secretary, Kim Howells, who derided the briefly popular but trouble-prone So Solid Crew as \"idiot macho rappers\", while David Cameron managed to get himself embroiled in a slanging match with Lethal Bizzle over whether his lyrics glorified gun crime. But it is safe to say Lamb is the first MP to remortgage his home to finance a rapper's career. \"Nick Clegg,\" he says, \"was amazed by it, I think.\" It looks as if Lamb has made a canny investment, but he's keen to point out he and his wife \"never thought they would see their money again\u2026 It wasn't exactly a ruthless business decision,\" he smiles, \"it wasn't Dragons' Den.\" Lamb did it because his son, Archie, is one half of Stryder's management team, Takeover Entertainment. He dropped out of sixth form with a friend, Jack Foster, to promote a hip-hop club night in Norwich, then the pair \"bluffed\" their way into being Stryder's managers when the rapper performed there. They had no experience in management, nor did they have any money, hence the need to borrow from Archie's dad, as well as from Jack's mum's Catholic priest and a variety of other elderly relations. \"At one stage,\" Norman Lamb notes wryly, \"the average age of investors in Tinchy Stryder's career was about 85.\" No, he says, he was never concerned about the impact investing in rap music might have on his political career. \"I heard Tinchy's music, heard the lyrics and I didn't see a problem. A lot of the lyrics are actually positive. It's dangerous going by stereotypes.\" Stryder is unconcerned that being associated with an MP may affect his credibility. \"Nah, no one really minds,\" he says. \"It depends what kind of credibility you've got. Nobody would think less of me because an MP likes my music.\" If the partnership between Stryder and Norman Lamb is, as Archie delicately puts it, \"not a natural marriage\", the partnership between Stryder and Archie Lamb hardly seems the perfect match, either. Sitting at the table today, Archie is doing his best to look the part \u2013 in time-honoured hip-hop style, there is an inspirational motto tattooed on his forearm in flowing script \u2013 and he and Foster have an impressive line in managerial hyperbole: \"We believe that whatever record label we work for, we can change that label for the better because we understand what kids want to listen to.\" Nevertheless, there's no escaping the fact that both of them are pink-cheeked, impossibly fresh-faced, middle-class boys from East Anglia, one of whom is called Archibald. This, it scarcely needs saying, makes them a highly improbable choice to manage a Ghanaian-born rapper, the youngest of eight children, who hails from the kind of Tower Hamlets estate where, he concedes, \"as you're growing up, you naturally have a lot of trouble and a lot of people end up victims without even wanting to be involved\". At first, Stryder says, he thought Lamb and Foster weren't serious, \"but I met them with my friend, and I actually realised they were positive. And after I met them, I was talking with my mate, and he was like, 'Yeah, man, they seem cool.' Just the two of them, with nothing behind them, it felt like we was just doing it all together. It didn't feel like I was dealing with some big record label.\" Besides, it wasn't as if Stryder had much to lose. He had been rapping since the age of 12, and had made some early headway both with a group of friends called Ruff Sqwad and on his own: he even appeared on a couple of remixes of singles by The Streets. But by 2006 no label would sign him and he didn't have a manager. After the explosion in British black music at the start of the decade, which made stars of So Solid Crew, Craig David and Dizzee Rascal, public interest had tailed off. The predominant sound, grime, was critically acclaimed, experimental and innovative, but wildly uncommercial. \"The way grime sounded, it just wasn't going to throw up kids who cross over into the charts all the time,\" says Darcus Beese, joint MD of Stryder's label Island. It wouldn't be fair to say that British rappers couldn't get arrested, because getting arrested seemed to be the one thing they seemed to be exceptionally good at: indeed, the only reason Lamb and Foster booked Stryder for their club was because their original choice, Crazy Titch, had recently been jailed for murder. Indeed, the grim reputation of British rap in the press \u2013 the jailed artists, the trouble at shows, the internal squabbling \u2013 was part of the problem, according to Lamb and Foster: Radio 1 had stopped playing it. \"When we got involved with Tinchy, British urban music was commercially at its lowest point,\" Archie says. \"We just wanted to change that. People were crying out for a non-threatening British urban artist.\" Stryder appeared to fit the bill. He had a turbulent time at school, \"always getting detentions and exclusions\", and had written a lot of lyrics about guns and knives \u2013 \"If I'd been living somewhere where I just saw lots of nice rich people every day, then I might have talked about that, but everything wasn't so rosy\". But he had refrained from dropping out of education after being forcibly enrolled in an after-school homework club, done well in his GCSEs and had no intention of abandoning his university career for music. He was talented, and girls liked him, and he was prepared to put in the work. Nevertheless, it was not an easy task. The three embarked on endless tours \"for petrol money\", travelling the country in Norman Lamb's car, getting Stryder to support indie bands and pop acts in the hope of building his profile outside the grime scene. The only money coming in wasn't from music, but from sales of Star In The Hood T-shirts. Record companies remained resolutely uninterested: Darcus Beese told them to come back when they'd written some music. By May 2008, they had a song, Stryderman, they thought was right but had run out of money. \"They had a crisis meeting in our kitchen one Sunday,\" Norman Lamb says. \"They just thought, 'We can't risk this.' They were worried about losing a vast amount of money if they put this Stryderman single out. They were thinking of setting up a coffee shop instead. And we said, 'Well, you've got to this point. You've got to do it.'\" They released the single. A few weeks later, Norman Lamb was in a Lib Dem parliamentary party meeting when his mobile phone rang. \"I remember nipping out into the committee room corridor to take the call. Stryderman had gone on the Radio 1 playlist. The next day Island Records got in touch, wanting to sign him.\" Today, Lamb and Foster confidently predict that by the end of the year Stryder will have sold a million singles. They're currently shifting tens of thousands of pounds' worth of Star In The Hood T-shirts every month. But fame, the rapper notes, isn't without its drawbacks. \"A lot of people know where my parents' house is,\" he says, darkly. \"You get the good bits, where people knock on your door and just want an autograph. But then word gets around you still live there. Believe it or not, people think whenever your video comes on the TV, you get paid. So they think there's mad money in my parents' house, and in certain areas that's not a good thing.\" He looks a bit exasperated. \"Smart people know that however much money you got, it's not sitting in your house.\" So he's buying a place in Essex. \"The best thing is just to move out. Dizzee did that. People say he sold out, but he didn't sell out. The aim for everyone is to move on to better things. You've got to respect that. If you're in the area and you're driving a nice car, it's like rubbing people's faces in it.\" Have you got a nice car? \"BMW.\" He laughs. He's also got a girlfriend, although was warned by Lamb and Foster not to mention her, in case it put female fans off him. \"To tell you the truth,\" he says, a little ruefully, \"girls wouldn't care if you told them to their face you had a girlfriend. They wouldn't care if you had your girlfriend standing right next to you. I'm just being honest, man.\" He's interrupted by a fan. Not excitable teenage girls, but a middle-aged Scotsman: \"I was being kept awake by music from a party the other night,\" he says, \"but then I recognised it was your music and I thought, 'I can't complain about that'. \" \"Tinchy, can I introduce a mate of mine?\" Norman Lamb asks. \"This is John Barrett, the MP for Edinburgh West.\" \"Can I request a photo opportunity for my young team with the star of the show?\" Barrett asks politely. Tinchy Stryder nods his assent and Britain's hottest new rapper heads off to have his picture taken with the Liberal Democrat MP for Edinburgh West. \u2022 A new single, Never Leave You, is out on 3 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
