This, explicitly, is the message of London Road, a new show about the effect of the 2006 Ipswich murders upon the community in which the serial killer and his five victims lived, in his case, and worked, in theirs. Or to quote Alecky Blythe, who collaborated on this National Theatre production with composer Adam Cork and the director Rufus Norris: \"It is really about the community and how the community has pulled together fantastically, almost a sort of blitz spirit.\" Critics have certainly responded to the National's transformation of this unpromising material into a captivating piece of theatre, which combines an innovative use of authentic speech with brilliant music and a celebration of regional, community resilience of the sort British dramatists do so well, with jolly hanging baskets bursting out all over the place. Who would have thought a story inspired by the Ipswich murders would one day send audiences home with the same kind of warm feeling as, say, The Full Monty? And that the musical retelling of this episode could be brought to the stage less than five years after Steve Wright murdered his final victim? Even by today's enterprising standards for dramatic adaptations of serial killing, this is quick work. By way of a comparison, the makers of a forthcoming, keenly anticipated ITV drama about Fred West, starring Dominic West, left 17 years between his arrest and the announcement of Appropriate Adult, now defended by its writer, Neil McKay, as \"a thoughtful and sensitive exploration of how human beings deal with the worst of human nature\". Presumably he expects the audience to respond in sensitive kind. For the post-Cracker, post-Lecter generation, the old, penny-dreadful voyeurism depicted in Orwell's essay on murders has been replaced by a more gracious style of connoisseurship, whereby scholarly assessment of the serial murderer is supposed to further understanding of the whole human condition. Recently the criminologist, David Wilson attacked the motives behind Appropriate Adult. \"Some people tell me that to deal with the phenomenon of serial killing, we have got to get into the minds of the killers,\" he wrote. \"What nonsense!\" But what McKay is doing, with his sensitive exploration, is surely no more misplaced than the esteemed serial killer authority Brian Masters, with his studies of Jeffrey Dahmer and Dennis Nilsen, or indeed the criminologist David Wilson, with his television documentary about Steve Wright, Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer. Had she lived, Steve Wright's youngest victim, Tania Nicol, would still be under 25. Before London Road opened at the National, her mother, Kerry Nicol, reproached the East Anglian Daily Times, where a writer had urged its performance in Ipswich: \"You or a family member have obviously never been through such a trauma as us victims.\" She was also upset not to have been consulted. \"I'm very annoyed that they didn't even have the decency to contact me in the first place and ask,\" she told the BBC. There has been a petition opposing the production and the Ipswich MP, Ben Gummer, described it as \"pretty sick-making\". \"There's always a time and a place for artists to look at difficult and tragic issues,\" he said, \"but sometimes that is decades or hundreds of years after the event.\" Hundreds? Along with the entire oeuvre of Channel 5, Gummer's guidelines might have suppressed, among other things, Sickert's Jack the Ripper's Bedroom, Alban Berg's Lulu, Capote's In Cold Blood and, more recently, Andrew O'Hagan's The Missing, which was part-published within months of James Bulger's murder in 1993 and is now due to be staged in September. Understandably, when confronted with Ms Nicol's objections, Alecky Blythe hoped that, when people came to see London Road, \"they will see the reason for doing it and hopefully that controversy will be put aside\". Where professional critics are concerned, her confidence in her own and Adam Cork's work has been triumphantly vindicated. Give or take a few moments where you seem to be watching a musical hybrid of Creature Comforts and Mike Leigh, with all the indulgent distance that implies, audiences seem likely to agree. But are London Road's many pleasures, which include some cracking jokes, likely to appeal to such recently violently bereaved Ipswich relations as go to see it? It seems impossible the National's collaborators did not consider this. And then, no doubt rightly, decide to ignore the implications. Although they might hope for some sensitivity in a country that is so squeamish about offending religious fanatics, the close relations of murdered people have not earned the right to censorship. How, had they kept mothers much in mind, would the National's collaborators have gone ahead and quoted a London Road resident expressing, true to Blythe's research, and not untypically, her relief that the neighbourhood has improved? \"Prostitutes made our life hell, why should we feel sorry for them? They were a complete pain in the neck \u2013 they're better off 10 foot under. I'd like to shake his hand.\" A man talks about a \"scaggy little whore\". From a dignity point of view it is hard to see this as an improvement on the women's primary designation as \"prostitutes\" in the media of 2006, as one by one they were murdered. This was further condensed by the Telegraph's learned Simon Heffer to \"tarts\". True, the dead women are, at one point, solemnly remembered at the National: a pause for protracted, reproachful silence from a trio of stage prostitutes makes the point about who is not there, putting up hanging baskets. And of course, without the horrific context of their murders, there would have been no outsiders' interest in London Road. However, that it belongs to a different creative universe cannot separate this piece, entirely, from such unspeakably crass productions as Yorkshire TV's Shipman which was broadcast, to the relatives' dismay, before a report had guessed at the number of his victims, or Channel 5's 2002 drama-documentary Fred and Rose, described as \"disgusting\" by the case's investigating officer, John Bennett. Channel 5's stuff about psychological insights was, he said, \"utterly spurious\". From the families' perspective, artistic provenance does not appear to make much difference. The cast and alleged intellectual ambition of Appropriate Adult have not mollified Anne Marie Davis, a daughter of Fred West, whose mother Rena Costello, was one of his victims. \"I feel it needs to be said,\" she said, speaking publicly for the first time in 10 years, \"that these young women and girls, they shouldn't be treated as public property.\" But the serial murderer had reduced them to that already, after targeting, where he could, girls on the margins, unlikely to be missed. Shipman exploited the invisibility of old age; Sutcliffe and Wright focused on prostitutes. It is odd, when you think of the victims whose violent deaths have not provided much entertainment, how often creative decisions echo these choices.
