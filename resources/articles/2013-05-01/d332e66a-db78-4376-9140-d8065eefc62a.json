The Spurs dynasty scored on their first seven possessions and built a 31-14 first quarter lead over a Grizzlies side making its first appearance in a conference finals. Although Memphis briefly rallied to within six points in the third quarter, San Antonio merely reapplied the gas to pull away. Memphis' Zach Randolph, previously averaging almost 20 points per game in the playoffs, was restricted to just 2 points, missing his first seven shots and scoring his only points on a tip-in with less than ten minutes left. The NBA's meanest defense allowed the Spurs to hit 53% of their shots and 14 3-pointers, a franchise record for the playoffs. Tony Parker led the Spurs with 20 points. Quincy Pondexter came off the Grizzlies bench to lead Memphis with 17 points. So comfortable was San Antonio's victory that every active player in both teams saw action, with the starters withdrawn with five minutes remaining. Game Two is on Tuesday night in San Antonio. The Eastern Conference finals between the Heat and the Indiana Pacers will open in Miami on Wednesday night.
