There was a police pick-up on the corner of Al Sadoon Street by the Ali Baba fountain, with soldiers on the back and guns mounted, pointing down the street. It was the first real sign of war. The fluffy teddy bear dangling from the rear view mirror was not as incongruous in Baghdad as it would have been anywhere else. The British embassy in Baghdad has been abandoned for twelve years now and three of us decided it was time it was reopened by an interim staff to improve relations with Iraq and to prepare for regime change in London. There would be an asylum section where British citizens fleeing the horrors of Tony Blair could take refuge pending the change of leadership in Whitehall and also an Irish Interest Section. We went to take a look at the premises and were met by a stonewall guard who flatly denied any knowledge of there ever having been a British embassy and he had a liberal supply of barbed wire to support his position, so instead we ambled down the road. Small children played on mounds of sand and ran about the street and women chatted between ramshackle fairytale houses, with overhanging wooden upstairs parts and blue patterned outsides. We stopped to decide where to go next and found ourselves in front of a group of curious children. Felicity waved at one - a tiny one in his sister's arms - and he started to cry. I knelt on the ground and said \"Marhaba\" (hello) and one or two replied, \"Hello.\" The crowd grew and I did what I do best - I pulled a face. All the kids laughed, so I pulled another. Their mothers began to join the cluster: stunning women with enormous dark eyes. \"Ismi Joanna,\" I said - my name is Joanna. \"Shwanna,\" the kids repeated, and went through all their names: Maha, Zaineb, Treibe, dozens and dozens of them, and this one is that one's sister and that one is this one's brother, and these two are cousins, and so on. Shortly a couple of guards came down and suggested we leave, so we waved to the kids, said \"Ma'assalama\" (goodbye) and walked away. The group which accompanied us grew and grew, though the guards told them to go back, and soon the whole party had reassembled by Zaid's taxi. Where were we from, the kids wanted to know? England, Ireland and Pakistan, between us. There was a girl of maybe ten who was learning English at school. \"What's that?\" she said, and \"Thank you.\" \"Afwan,\" I replied: you're welcome. A tiny one with round cheeks, long black plaits and a face full of mischief blew a raspberry and doubled up with mirth. I blew kisses, and they blew kisses back. I could describe everyone one of them as \"the gorgeous one with huge eyes\": bright, chatty little girls and laughing boys, a little girl all in black with the most melting smile, a taller one carrying her little brother, kissing and nuzzling his cheek, a young boy who tried to copy the faces I pulled, all of them with hearts wide open and full of laughter. Eventually we had to leave and they waved us off with more kisses blown after the taxi. I suddenly caught sight of the sharp, bright crescent of the new moon in the dusk sky. Then Felicity pointed out the Ministry of Defence building, just a minute or so away from those laughing children, their mothers and their homes, right in the firing line if the US and UK decide the Ministry is a target. Coming back from the British embassy, Zaid wanted to know whether British women liked football. His wife, he said, was always asking him. Some did, I told him. Brighton was my team. He's been to Brighton - he came in 1977, when he was five. He's a Liverpool fan. In his glove box is a picture of his four month old son Omar in Zaid's Liverpool shirt, the walls around him plastered with team posters and Michael Owen pictures. Liverpool were knocked out of the FA cup the other day, apparently, and he's not happy, but at least they won the Worthington Cup a couple of weeks ago, beating Manchester United. His wife is a Manchester United fan. I told him I used to live next door to the Newcastle United ground. Eyes alight, he said, \"To St James Park? It's my dream, but next door to Anfield.\" If his wife could meet me, he said, she'd never stop talking to me about football. He asked how long I was staying in Iraq. About another three weeks, I said, was the plan. \"What will you do if the war starts?\" \"Zaid,\" I said, \"I don't know. What will you do?\" \"I'll be on my roof, getting the view. I've seen it all before. So if you find you need anything, just call me.\" Zaid is thirty; two years older than me, and all but two of the last twenty-two have been at war. Children play football on the roofs of bomb shelters, raised above the ground because it's impossible to build them fully underground when the water table is so high. Walking between them, you have to duck the balls, usually followed by a child, as they fly over the edge. Then over breakfast a Frenchman was talking about the likelihood of France using its veto. France has said it will only veto if another country does as well. Less than 1% of its trade is with Iraq; perhaps 20% is with the US. Likewise Russia and China need US trade more than Iraqi. Turkey has caved in to US pressure. So sorry children - your lives are less important than trade with the US. I know the US and UK are going to do what they want regardless of international opinion, law and process, but that's not a reason for the rest of the world to acquiesce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
