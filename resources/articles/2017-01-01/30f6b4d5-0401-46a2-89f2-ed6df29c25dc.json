It was a nice touch by the Manchester City manager but the niceties were part of a performance better than that produced by his team at Liverpool and exposed by an angry, exasperated exchange with Txiki Begiristain shortly afterwards. There was no goodwill to be found in defeat by J\u00fcrgen Klopp and falling 10 points adrift of Chelsea, the leaders. Press duties completed, Guardiola headed back to the makeshift dressing rooms in the bowels of Anfield\u2019s new main stand where he met Begiristain, City\u2019s director of football and a man with some serious questions to answer over the club\u2019s expensive and erratic recruitment drive. Guardiola, pacing up and down, scratched his head, pulled at his tie and began punching his fist into the palm of his hand as he dissected City\u2019s display with his former Barcelona colleague. They have trailed and recovered before but that was at a club attuned to Guardiola\u2019s methods and vice-versa. A revealing glimpse into genuine frustration and the performance that provoked it were reminders of how much work is required to recreate that understanding at the Etihad Stadium. \u201cThe manager was angry at half\u2011time,\u201d Yaya Tour\u00e9 admitted. \u201cWhen you are losing like that and Liverpool are the better side then it\u2019s not going to be happy at half-time. It was disappointing and we all felt that. Of course he is going to be angry. He is a manager who can be angry. We have to sometimes improve and react to situations, and of course we knew Liverpool would be waiting when we lost the ball and they did that to score. So he will be angry for everything that is happening. \u201cWe are not going to be perfect. There are times when we won\u2019t take opportunities but we can take opportunities from this too. Anfield is not easy but we can learn from this and what the manager says about it. When you lose games, what do you have to do? You are disappointed and you want to bounce back. We don\u2019t want to let the gap grow much more between us and Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. So we have to react. We will use it \u2013 we are not going to give up. We will go to the end.\u201d Tour\u00e9 and co responded to their manager\u2019s criticism, controlling possession in the second half and forcing Liverpool into a retreat when David Silva switched to the centre in place of the subdued Kevin De Bruyne, but not to the extent of creating one chance of note. Klopp\u2019s team were restricted as an attacking threat, too, but having punished City\u2019s weakness in the air early, when Georginio Wijnaldum produced an outstanding leap and header to convert Adam Lallana\u2019s eighth-minute cross, their compact shape held firm. The Liverpool manager had bemoaned the freedom with which Joe Allen roamed between his midfield and defence in their previous outing, against Stoke City. He ensured there was no repeat against Manchester City with a more protective midfield trio of Wijnaldum, Jordan Henderson and Emre Can. Raheem Sterling, fading amid the hostility that greeted his latest return to Anfield, De Bruyne, Silva, in the first half, and Sergio Ag\u00fcero, throughout his first appearance in 28 days, were comprehensively shackled. Klopp had the answers to City\u2019s array of individual talents. His team have collected 13 points from 18 while Philippe Coutinho has been injured and, as the Brazilian nears fitness, so Liverpool have emerged as formidable challengers to Chelsea. Klopp said it must be annoying for Antonio Conte\u2019s team to have won 13 consecutive league games and still found Liverpool hanging on six points behind. Equally, how annoying must it be to have won 12 of the last 16 league games and sit second? \u201cWe came from eighth position last year so we don\u2019t think about being champion or whatever this year, but we are much better than last year and the position is completely different,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cWe are fine. If anyone else thought we had to be champion this year then maybe it seems different to them but we are fine. We are where we are and if it ends there then cool. \u201cIf we are still there five matches before the end and are only a few points behind then we will think about something else but not in this moment. I\u2019m not like this. I have had much more difficult situations in my life than being second in a very difficult league. We are happy about our way and what the rest is doing we can have no influence on until we play them. That\u2019s all we can do. I\u2019m not annoyed. Not for one second. \u201cI won a league twice and I honestly didn\u2019t think about the opportunity until really late. We have targets. We are ambitious. You saw it again against City how ambitious the boys are but talking about it doesn\u2019t bring you one point. You have to work. When you see the final line and if you are still in and around then the pressure will increase. You could see the pressure here \u2013 not because we didn\u2019t want to lose the game but because we wanted to win it. That is really pressure against a very good side. You do the analysis and think: \u2018Oh my God, I don\u2019t want to show the boys all of this because they are a really good side.\u2019 I know there is criticism of their defending or whatever but they play some of the best football in the world and you have to defend it. We did it. I\u2019m happy with our situation in the table at the moment.\u201d Klopp can be content not only with Liverpool\u2019s league position but how his team have developed rapidly according to his managerial ideals. Guardiola, between the new year wishes, admitted he is unsure when City will do likewise. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not able to tell you that,\u201d he said. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen is here more than one season, more than one year. I\u2019ve been here just six months and the way we want to play in the league is not that simple. We need a little bit more time but I\u2019m a guy who is so optimistic and we\u2019re going to try.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
