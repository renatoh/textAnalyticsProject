The hotel opened in 1931 and has gone through good and bad times. During the Communist era it was a state-owned Interhotel and was not maintained at all. It closed in 1994 and when it reopened it changed ownership several times. It still looks pretty much as it did - everything from the bathrooms to the public rooms is Art Deco - but we redid all the plumbing, the electricity and the floors. You can imagine how much work that was. Any famous guests? Lots of people, from Peter O'Toole and Gerard Depardieu to Cher. In the Fifties the Be-Bop bar was a focal point for European jazz and I am proud to say that many jazz musicians stay here. Wynton Marsalis was a guest when he had a concert in Prague. After his show he played a session with our musicians at the hotel until 3am. The Czech Republic and Poland have very strong reputations for jazz. Under Communism musicans had to pass strict exams to become professionals, so it was taken very seriously. What about a day out? Prague is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and the major sights, such as the Castle, are well-known. I would recommend a walk around Kampa, a small district by the river. The houses where Franz Kafka and Mozart lived are open to the public. There are small breweries all around Prague which you can visit. Beer is the Czech national drink and we probably have the highest consumption in Europe. And a night out? We opened our new fish restaurant in September and it has been very successful. It is quite small, only 30 seats, and it's not uncommon to see people like the Finance Minister. There is a bit of a restaurant monopoly in Prague: a pair of Scandinavians own some very nice restaurants, such as Pravda, while an Indian also owns two or three good places. The problem was that Prague was a bit behind so this is very good for the city and it should change very soon when Czechs who have worked for these restaurants for a couple of years start their own. It is still hard to find a good nightclub but Prague is changing daily. Radisson SAS reservations: 0800 374 411.
