But only just. In a classic, wet, gloomy, muck-and-nettles Cup atmosphere, Peterborough United, two goals down at half-time and 56 places and two divisions below Newcastle, staged a comeback that had memories of Hereford flooding back for all who think in black and white, stripes or eras. A walloping own-goal from the Newcastle centre-half Andy O'Brien began Peterborough's revival eight minutes after the interval, and 16 minutes later Dave Farrell, a 30-year-old journeyman outside right, cut in from the touchline and carved his name on the old competition with a 20-yard shot that beat the outstretched right hand of Shay Given. London Road was in euphoric turmoil and about to be twinned with Edgar Street. Barry Fry's spunky side sensed history, especially when the former Tottenham Hotspur forward Neale Fenn was released by Farrell with 13 minutes to go. Fenn was behind the Newcastle defence and one on one with Given. His flicked effort was true but Given managed to get his left hand to it. \"We were a long way from Cardiff when Fenn went through,\" the Newcastle manager Bobby Robson said afterwards to a question about Newcastle's chances of winning the Cup again. \"But we showed character and resilience. Peterborough did themselves proud today and I'm a bit sad that they haven't got a replay at St James'. Sad but glad.\" Fry estimated that a replay would have earned Peterborough another \u00a3500,00 to add to that sum they earned yesterday. But it was snatched away in a fashion that Fry described as \"cruel\". Just over five frenetic minutes had passed from Given's save - a period that included an agonisingly close chip from Peterborough's Andy Clarke - when an Alan Shearer header from Nolberto Solano's free-kick bounced on to the arm of Leon McKenzie. The contact was hardly deliberate but Neal Barry pointed to the spot and Shearer struck an emphatic penalty past Mark Tyler. He blew his cheeks out at that and a minute later was joined by all at Newcastle when the unlikely figure of Aaron Hughes met a deft cross from Wayne Quinn to make it 4-2. Peterborough's time had gone but they still enjoyed the moment. A standing ovation was the minimum they deserved, not least for the adventure they had shown. Prompted by the quick-quick passes of the local hero Jimmy Bullard, the home side overcame the early setback of O'Brien's goal. O'Brien swivelled on to a Sylvain Distin header and nudged the ball past Tyler. That should have settled the visitors but, missing Kieron Dyer, Gary Speed and Robert Lee from their midfield, they struggled to match Bullard and co. McKenzie and Tom Williams had useful chances and Bullard shaved a post with a whipped free-kick. But two minutes before the break, Jamie McClen, a fringe member of the squad playing in his first league or cup game for more than two years, scored his first goal for the club with a cool, clipped finish after a fortunate ricochet. \"Whatever Barry Fry said to them at half-time worked,\" said Shearer. Within four minutes of the re-start Marc Joseph pelted down the right and delivered a cross to the far post. O'Brien was under no pressure but placed a bullet header past Given, quite unbelievably. \"Andy's just said they will be showing that on Match of the Day tonight,\" said Shearer. \"I said to him that they'll be showing it in 40 years.\" Play began to swing with such energy that Farrell's equaliser came from a thwarted Newcastle attack. Bullard began it; Farrell finished it. Fry was asked the score by the fans and put two fingers from each hand in the air repeatedly. But then came Given's fingers, and then came McKenzie's. It was Fry and Peterborough who had been told where to go. \"There is no better duo than Bobby Robson and Alan Shearer to win the FA Cup,\" said Fry. \"They are a credit to the game. Lucky bastards.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
