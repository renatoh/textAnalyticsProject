Dave Cox, who is heading the Historical Enquiries Team, said detectives would reopen the files on 3,268 cases and would attempt to achieve the \"best resolution\" for victims' families, including possible prosecutions. His team of 84 staff - who start work on Monday - will have a budget of \u00a330m, including \u00a37.3m for forensic scientists using modern DNA techniques. The team will aim to solve \"cold cases\". It will focus on an initial batch of 100 cases, examining unsolved murders in chronological order. The first case dates back to 1969, and cases up to the signing of the Good Friday agreement in 1998 will be looked at. The creation of the team - which is expected to exist for around five years - is the latest government attempt to dispel some of the remaining bitterness around the conflict. The families of some victims have welcomed the initiative, and hope it could bring a measure of closure. However, others are opposed to the idea, arguing that it is better to leave the past behind. There is scepticism over whether anyone will actually be prosecuted. Some see the release of paramilitary prisoners as part of the deal to secure the Good Friday agreement as emblematic of the official approach to those who committed murders in the Troubles. Peter Hain, the Northern Ireland secretary, insisted it was possible that the new team at the Police Service of Northern Ireland would secure prosecutions. Asked whether anyone would ever serve a sentence as a result of the investigations, Mr Hain told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If there is enough evidence to proceed to prosecution, then this is what will happen,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"If there isn't, then what is unique about this investigation ... is that there will be an engagement with the families, with the victims. \"The investigators will sit down with them on a basis of maximum disclosure and talk to them about what happened and the responsibilities involved so there is some accountability.\" He said the team was independent and would also investigate the \"limited\" number of cases allegedly involving members of the security services. The initiative, first proposed by the chief constable, Sir High Orde, in September 2004 would help people \"move forward and Northern Ireland move forward\", he added. Mr Cox, a former retired Metropolitan police commander, said: \"I do not for a moment underestimate the complexity of this challenge or the potential emotional stress for relatives associated with revisiting these tragic events. \"That is why families will sit at the very heart of our investigations, and that is why our primary objective will be to work with them to achieve some measure of resolution for them.\" Originally it had been estimated that there were 2,000 unsolved murders. However, Mr Cox said the enquiries team would now be looking into 3,268 deaths because there were some cases in which one person may have been convicted but other suspects avoided arrest. He added that when a family wanted a prosecution and the evidence existed, the team would pursue it in the courts. In other cases, it would examine whether there could be any other forms of resolution. A helpdesk for families will operate from the team's Sprucefield headquarters, outside Lisburn, and can be contacted on 02892 589258."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
