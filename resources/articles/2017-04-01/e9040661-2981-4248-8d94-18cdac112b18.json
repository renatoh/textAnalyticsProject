The 36 students, from the community of Ntaria, or Hermannsburg, set off on the Arrarnta Tribe Ride For Pride on Wednesday morning, after a blessing and farewell from the community. In five days they will cross 127km of desert on wild brumbies they helped train and arrive in Alice Springs in time to take part in the desert town\u2019s Anzac Day parade. On foot and on horseback the students will march to honour and remember Indigenous war veterans and the central desert brumbies used by the Light Horse Infantry in the first world war. Because of the close proximity of Easter to Anzac Day this year, the normally six-day journey has been packed into five. A support crew of non-riding students will learn and work with Indigenous rangers along the way. Jeremy Moketarinja, an assistant teacher with the school who also teaches the students to ride, is accompanying his daughter on the journey. \u201cI love horses, I like training with Chris and seeing all these kids riding horses, going through bushes and all that stuff, sleeping under the stars and sitting around the campfire telling stories,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the Aboriginal people from here went to fight wars somewhere in Turkey for the light horsemen. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it for them and for ourselves and our community. To make every blackfella in Australia happy because there\u2019s nothing like this happening in other schools.\u201d Moketarinja said it was \u201cgood fun\u201d to work with the children and he was proud to see them take part in the ride. \u201cYou see what you learned them. Some of these kids had never ridden a horse before. My daughter is with us, she\u2019d never rode any horse before and she\u2019s doing good now.\u201d The trip is the highlight of the Ntaria school\u2019s horse training program, a VET course open to senior students from year 9 to 12 in the hopes it will raise attendance and school engagement. Since 2013 students have learned to train and ride wild brumbies while gaining certification in agriculture, rural operations, or tourism. \u201cThis year especially we\u2019re really starting to see the fruits of our labour,\u201d Chris Barr, a teacher and the horse trainer at the school, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cSelf-confidence is going through the roof \u2013 their self-confidence and their attitude towards coming to school.\u201d Barr says the school has seen 90% attendance among the children enrolled in the horse program in the past year. It\u2019s difficult to overstate the horse culture in Ntaria, rivalled in popularity only by AFL. Wild brumbies can often be seen running through the surrounding country, made famous by the watercolour artist Albert Namatjira. Days-long rides and events are regular features on the calendar and horses feature in much of the local artworks. The course is open to all senior students from year 9 to year 12 and has seen an increase in numbers on last year. \u201cThis program is so important for our students, it brings the whole community together and celebrates our Indigenous servicemen past and present,\u201d Ntaria school principal Cath Greene said. \u201cOur students are here in droves every day; this program gives them something to look forward to and teaches them far more than the competencies can evaluate.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
