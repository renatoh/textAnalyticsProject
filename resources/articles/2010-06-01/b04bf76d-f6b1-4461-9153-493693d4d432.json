We begin of course with the hosts. Mexico scored late to cancel out Siphiwe Tshabalala's wonder strike for South Africa, while elsewhere in Group A, France and Uruguay played out a draw with no score but plenty of snore. Richard Williams braves the vuvuzelas and reports on the atmosphere from Johannesburg. Plus, we hear from real-life American Liz Hottel from the Guardian Fans' Network about the build-up to that England-USA clash you might have heard about. We're back tomorrow with analysis on that and the rest of the action from the second day in South Africa. In the meantime, post your feedback on the blog below, and follow us on Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
