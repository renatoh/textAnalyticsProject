Hart was demoted to second-choice goalkeeper following the error that allowed Chelsea's Fernando Torres to score a late winner at Stamford Bridge on 27 October. The 26-year-old played in City's 3-2 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday evening. But with Pellegrini resting some of his first-choice players, as City had already qualified for the group stages, Hart's inclusion did not necessarily denote a recall to the Chilean's strongest XI. Pellegrini did consider reinstating Hart for the visit of Arsenal but it is understood that by Friday evening he was again leaning towards retaining Pantilimon who, since his promotion, has appeared comfortable in the role. When asked at his pre-Arsenal press conference whether Pellegrini would choose Hart to face the leaders, he would not be drawn. \"We will see [on Saturday] the 11 starters. We'll see when is the best moment to bring him [Hart] back,\" said the manager. \"Costel deserves respect. He is doing very well and the team are winning almost all the games. We have two goalkeepers and we'll see when is the best moment he can return.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
