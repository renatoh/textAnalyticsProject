Share your photos", "bodyText": "As the main parties ramp up their election campaigns, letterboxes across the country will begin to clog with leaflets vying to attract voters\u2019 attention. We want to hear the most outlandish claims your local candidates from the main political parties or independents have made to try to win your vote. If you\u2019ve spotted claims you think should be challenged, unverified bar charts, or facts you think need checking: send them over to us. We\u2019re also interested in any candidates who\u2019re denying the climate crisis. Share your photos If you\u2019ve received an eyebrow-raising leaflet, letter or other printed material from a political party or candidate ahead of December\u2019s general election, send us a photo.
