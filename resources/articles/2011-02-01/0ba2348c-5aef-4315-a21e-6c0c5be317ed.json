A report published by the Institute for Public Policy Research North shows polarisation between rich and poor was rising even before the recession of 2008 took hold. The report, Richer Yet Poorer: Economic inequality and polarisation in the North of England, shows that economic growth has exacerbated the gap between rich and poor with the highest-earning 20% increasing their earnings at double the rate of the bottom 20%. It suggests increasing inequality is damaging for all of society, with the more unequal cities appearing to have less community cohesion and a weaker sense of belonging. \"Currently, it is fairer up north, with income and pay inequality lower than the UK average,\" said Ed Cox, director of IPPR North. \"But over the past decade of economic growth, before recession hit, inequality increased. \"Some will argue this was a price worth paying. However, our research has found that inequality is potentially bad news for everyone and may affect the social fabric of our communities.\" The report found that, of the northern regions, the north-west has the greatest pay inequality, with the top 20% earning \u00a3427 more a week than the bottom 20%. The greatest disparities are found in London, where the top 20% earn \u00a3686 more a week than the bottom 20%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
