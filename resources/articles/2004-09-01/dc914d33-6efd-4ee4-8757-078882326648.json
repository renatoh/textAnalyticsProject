This season, despite their status as European champions, they seem intent on repeating the feat by making themselves even bigger outsiders. They go into tonight's match at Chelsea in the worst imaginable shape. With their coach and several of their best players departed, Porto's season has started badly. But they will still be keen to show Jose Mourinho they can succeed without him. Mourinho's close-season departure for Chelsea prompted Porto to import the Italian Luigi Del Neri from Chievo Verona only to sack him after six weeks, before a ball had been kicked in anger. Del Neri, who upset the squad after changing tactics and training methods, said: \"The Portuguese have no understanding of tactical culture.\" Porto looked nearer home, to neighbouring Spain, to replace Del Neri by drafting in the former Celta Vigo coach V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez. He had little time to prepare his team. They lost to Claudio Ranieri's Valencia in Monaco in the European Supercup, drew in the league with Braga, Estoril and Uniao de Leiria, and were held goalless at home in between by CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. Last Saturday's 1-0 win away to Vitoria Guimaraes stopped the rot, but the last time Porto had gone four matches or more without winning was four seasons ago, before the Mourinho era. Fern\u00e1ndez has tried various systems, from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2 to 4-2-4, but all without success and he has yet to find the right formula. \"We have to be more humble and work harder,\" said the midfield anchorman Costinha. \"We have to keep the same attitude we had in the past, as we're a winning club. Sometimes you need to review the structure; we all have to reflect on it. We need to work closer together and we also need to take our chances more.\" He was not worried about Chelsea's good start, saying: \"I've seen lots of teams win their first game and then not qualify - no disrespect to Chelsea.\" Porto sold their defenders Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira to Chelsea, the playmaker Deco to Barcelona and the midfielder Pedro Mendes to Tottenham for a combined \u00a342m. They signed the winger Ricardo Quaresma from Barcelona, Helder Postiga from Tottenham, the defender Pepe from Mar\u00edtimo, the Greek right-back Giourkas Seitaridis from Panathinaikos, Hugo Leal from Paris Saint-Germain plus the Brazilians Diego from Santos and Luis Fabiano from Sao Paulo for a total of \u00a316m. That helped pay off some of their debts but left the team uncoordinated. Of the new arrivals, only Luis Fabiano has looked convincing. Injuries to Seitaridis and Nuno Valente mean Porto will be without both their first-choice full-backs against Chelsea. But it is the absence of Mourinho's influence which weighs the heaviest. Rather than the team going through a period of soul-searching, Mourinho would have taken control; players would know where they stood and would already be pulling in the same direction. It does not help that Fern\u00e1ndez has clashed often with the South African striker Benni McCarthy. Fern\u00e1ndez has the backing of the Porto board, at least for now. The president, Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa, said: \"Del Neri tried to change too many things. But I've picked the best man now in Fern\u00e1ndez. He'll turn things round.\" A fellow director, Lourenco Pinto, said: \"Mourinho arrived in the middle of a season and had time to build a team for the seasons which followed. People understood this. They have to understand that this is also a transition period.\" The new winger Quaresma said: \"We're a bit frustrated but we have a lot of experienced players who are used to winning and there's a great spirit. I'm sure we'll get back to winning ways very soon.\" But will tonight be too soon?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
