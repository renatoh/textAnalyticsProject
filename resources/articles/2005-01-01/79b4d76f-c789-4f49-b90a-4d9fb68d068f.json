I was a singer in a band in the mid-Eighties and did a load of different jobs to sustain myself, including a bit of travel writing. Then in 1991, at 27, my fianc\u00e9e died and I needed something dramatic to motivate me so I bought a motorbike and drove round Africa - 10,000 miles in 10 months. I crossed deserts, mountains, rainforests. I rode down through Angola - a fascinating route to Cape Town - and came back up the east coast through Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. It was a big journey and a lot of weird things happened, so I wrote a book about it, Running With The Moon . I was then asked to write another one and, as I had always wanted to visit the places described in the first book I ever read - The Man Who Would Be King - I travelled through India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. That book was also a success, leading to my third which involved riding a horse along the Silk Road from Kashgar to the Caspian Sea. Why did you then set up your travel company, Wild Frontiers? Travel writing is hard work and I wanted to think of another way of using my travel experiences. I stuck an advert in The Observer inviting people to travel to the north-west frontier in Pakistan. I got eight replies. Luckily, there was advice against travelling to the area and the group shrunk to two - a big relief as I made quite a few cock-ups. The two guys I took were brilliant and have been back on trips with me since. After 9/11, the area closed down and I expanded to favourite places from my motorcycle journey - Niger, Morocco and Ethiopia - and to central Asia. I run horse trips in Kyrgyzstan as well. Have you ever run into trouble in remote areas? I was once held hostage by a warlord in Afghanistan for about 40 hours. We were put in a room and kept to one side and there were whispered conversations and men coming and going with Kalashnikovs. He wanted to make sure that we weren't doing anything that would backfire on him later. Once he realised we weren't he let us go. One thing I've taken out of these trips is that what people perceive as dangerous over here is rarely dangerous out there. It's a fear of the unknown. My travel philosophy has always been to engage with everybody on the same level. How much research do you do before going to a country? Virtually nothing. I prefer to walk into a place, put on the local garb and just get stuck in. Though I remember turning up in Central Asia, having learned some Uzbek in London, only to find that it was useless and I should have learnt Russian. A quick look at a Lonely Planet would have told me things that I hadn't bothered to check but I like doing these things on the hoof. You need to talk to local people, and that's what I've always loved. Drifting through a country taking photographs is fine, but it's very skin deep. If you take longer, stay with nomads and help them with the milking or whatever, you discover much more. Which is your favourite area? I have a real affinity with the north-west frontier. It is a fascinating culture populated by incredibly passionate and interesting people. I've even got a little house up there in Chitral in the Hindu Kush. Where is your next destination? I do crave a new culture to explore. I'd love to get out to Indo-China next year and South and Central America. My ideal holiday would be to drive round the south of France in an old MG. I haven't been skiing for 14 years and I used to be a ski instructor. I suppose I'm just not good at relaxing. Jonny Bealby runs Wild Frontiers, www.wildfrontiers.co.uk.
