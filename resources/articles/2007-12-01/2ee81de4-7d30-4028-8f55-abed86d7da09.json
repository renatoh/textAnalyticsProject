Civil engineer Patrick Darragh was given an indeterminate jail sentence for public protection yesterday over the chainsaw assault, which left Claire Bates needing 56 stitches to her head and surgery to reattach an ear. He must serve at least four years before he can apply to be released on licence. Northampton crown court heard that Darragh met Bates in 1998, when he was convicted of attacking Angela Spriggs with a serrated steak knife and jailed for 3\u00bd years, and she was his legal representative. They married when he was released in 2000. The 52-year-old, who was born in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, last month pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on Bates at their remote cottage in Denford, near Thrapston, Northamptonshire, in May. The court heard yesterday that Darragh, known to his friends as Dessie, was a Jekyll and Hyde character who had flown into a jealous rage after accusing his wife of having an affair with a work colleague he had introduced her to. He came into the living room with the chainsaw saying: \"If I can't have you then nobody will.\" In a statement read to the court by prosecutor Timothy Spencer QC, she said: \"I thought he was going to kill me. I was on the floor by the door. He was putting it (the chainsaw) in my head on my left hand side. I can just remember the noise and him putting it in my head. I don't know how I got away because he didn't stop. \" She went on: \"I remember I was lying on my front face down by the back door, Dessie was down by my right hand side. He was not standing, he was on top of me because I could feel pressure on my back. I was screaming saying 'no, please no'.\" Bates managed to escape to a neighbour's house to call the police. Darragh tried to slash his wrists. Judge Charles Wide QC said the attack had been horrific. \"I have no doubt at all that you are a very dangerous man indeed,\" he told Darragh. \"It may be that you are so dangerous that it will be many, many years before you are released.\" He added: \"It is claimed from your history that you have it in you to have a real hold over vulnerable women and their continued devotion in spite of your abuse of them might seem to an outsider very strange indeed, but it is a symptom of the hold you had over both of them. You were jealous and controlling and that is what lay at the root of this, becoming extremely violent with a chainsaw.\" The judge said it was extraordinary that Bates' injuries had not been more serious. A video of the chainsaw slicing through a tree trunk in 15 seconds, and the bloodstained and torn jumper worn by Bates on the night of the attack, were shown to the court. Graham Buchanan, defending, said she had been a frequent visitor to the category A prison where Darragh has been on remand. \"She is an educated lady, a qualified lady,\" he said. \"She knew exactly what had happened with his former partner. She went into it undoubtedly with her eyes open.\" In a letter Bates said she felt her husband was a \"very kind man deep down\" who had loved her but their relationship deteriorated when she miscarried their child in January. Darragh had originally pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, but the prosecution accepted his guilty plea to the lesser charge of grievous bodily harm with intent, after taking his wife's wishes into account."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
