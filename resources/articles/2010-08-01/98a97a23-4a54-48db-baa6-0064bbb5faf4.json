And so if the pope tells the prime minister that he can only spare him 20 minutes, that's an end to it. And that's what David Cameron will get at Archbishop's House, Westminster in three weeks' time when Pope Benedict XVI brings the tour to London. By contrast Harriet Harman, as acting leader of the opposition, appears from the itinerary to have a 30-minute window to work with. But he may shut her up. He has to take mass at Westminster Cathedral the end of that period. And there's a 10-minute slot pencilled in for the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who some might have expected to share an audience with his coalition partner. But how would that have looked to a conservative pope? This way is best. \u2022 Yes, he who is revered, will walk once again among his people. Children will remember the moment always. Strong men will weep. But that's enough about Rupert Murdoch. We were talking about the pope. Might there be a connection between the two? Officials aren't saying, but the church has done a fine job of tapping wealthy individuals to fund the papal visit \u2013 raising more than \u00a34m from private donations compared with the \u00a31.2m or so from the people in the pews. And earlier this year Murdoch gatecrashed a lunch at Wapping between the Times editor James Harding and the Roman Catholic archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols. By all accounts, they had a great time. Murdoch picked up the tab then, and if he is helping to do so again \u2013 for papal visits cost a pretty penny \u2013 no one would be surprised, for he has form in this area. A decade ago, he donated $10m to the RC cathedral of Los Angeles, where a note of his generous contribution was etched on a stained glass window. He was made a knight commander of St Gregory at a ceremony in Los Angeles in 1998, to the consternation of conservative Catholics. He has been doing God's work ever since. \u2022 Always dependable, ever resourceful. Witness the sequence of events surrounding the unmasking of the Stig, Top Gear's mysterious test driver, now reputed to be former James Bond stuntman Ben Collins. News of the Stig's likely identity is revealed in Murdoch's Sunday Times. That timing is terribly convenient. For the story is run the day before the BBC is due in court seeking to prevent The Stig's identity being put in the public domain by an autobiography. And who, pray tell, seeks to publish this autobiography? Why it's the Murdoch imprint HarperCollins. And what is the effect of that disclosure? It becomes more difficult for the BBC to claim the book would amount to breach of confidentiality. And where could you read all about it, with the appropriate slant? In Murdoch's flagship, the Sun, \"BBC fee spent on Stig fight\", said the headline yesterday, reflecting the thoughts of HarperCollins. Amazing how things come together. Work hard, you get the luck. \u2022 Arts news now, and exciting indeed to know that the comedian Jim Davidson, now based in Dubai, has brushed off the disappointment of bankruptcy and has written a play called Stand Up And Be Counted. It is set backstage at an Aids benefit concert. The main character is a middle-aged, old-fashioned, bigoted comic. \u2022 Finally, as pupils up and down the country share the joy and pain of their GCSE results, philosopher Roger Scruton moves to quash speculation \u2013 prompted by a mischievous reader of the periodical Intelligent Life \u2013 that he once did a schoolgirl's philosophy essay for her and that she only got a C. \"I have no recollection of any such thing \u2013 sounds extremely unlikely to me,\" Dr Scruton tells us. \"But if I had written the essay then of course it would have got a C for political incorrectness if for nothing else.\" And he's mellowed somewhat. In days gone by, he might have claimed an A."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
