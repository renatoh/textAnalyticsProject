From the high of a repeat 13-goal drubbing of New Zealand in Liverpool last week to this shock 48-45 loss to outsiders South Africa, England now face the daunting prospect of not only having to defeat Australia on Sunday but needing to do so by at least five goals to have any chance of achieving Quad Series history. South Africa lost the opening match of this tournament 62-45 to Australia. Here they were a different team; all over England from the outset to turn all permutations on their head. The South Africans led by four at half-time and expertly held their composure despite raucous local support. This result leaves Australia, who hung on 53-50 to hand New Zealand successive defeats, in pole position with a 10-goal advantage over England. Perhaps England were guilty of complacency; of glancing ahead to the Australian challenge. England found themselves behind throughout and were frequently rattled. The normally composed shooter Jo Harten (18/22) botched the odd sitter from under the hoop and spilt the ball on another occasion. Jade Clarke had one pass tipped near the death. Others took turns remonstrating with the officials as frustrations bubbled to the surface. The England coach, Tracey Neville, lamented a poor defensive start and squandered possession which allowed South Africa\u2019s confidence to grow, but offered no excuses for her side\u2019s poor performance. \u201cThe girls played an outstanding match last Sunday. They\u2019ve had plenty of rest coming into this series. What it shows to them is world-class teams need to constantly keep coming out with stellar performances. We learned a big lesson today but it\u2019s better to learn it now than later,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThere were times we could have won that game so I\u2019ve got to look at our own performance.\u201d South Africa had beaten England 13 times previously \u2013 the last a three-goal Quad Series win two years ago in New Zealand \u2013 but the hosts, now Commonwealth Games champions, were widely expected to comfortably pull away. \u201cYou never want to lose but if they can\u2019t pick themselves up for another day tomorrow then they\u2019re not world-class players,\u201d Neville added. \u201cThis is a test of character \u2013 it\u2019s about mental and physical strength.\u201d Australia are missing star shooter and captain Caitlin Bassett with a broken forearm, and wing defence Gabi Simpson due to a leg injury, yet after two straight wins they are now firm favourites. England will need every soul in what will be a sold-out arena to take the title for the first time. The Australia coach, Lisa Alexander, turned up the heat on England too. \u201cThe pressure is right on England,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve beaten New Zealand by 13 and we\u2019ve beaten them by three so the pressure is on them.\u201d The South African coach and former Australian mentor, Norma Plummer, predicts those in green and gold will emerge victorious. \u201cI reckon the Aussies will take it,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
