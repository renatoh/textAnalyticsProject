In another sign of the crisis engulfing the prison service, official figures show that it has lost 6,000 years of officer experience in the last year alone, hampering the fight against rising violence and self harm. While the government is now desperately recruiting officers amid signs that the prison service is under unsustainable pressure after years of staffing cuts, the data shows that significant numbers of experienced members of staff have walked away. An analysis of published information about prison service staff, undertaken by Labour, found that one in three prison officers has less than three years\u2019 experience, compared with one in eight in 2010. It follows a series of warnings about the safety of many prisons, the conditions that inmates are kept in and failures in preparing them for life outside. Last week figures emerged that showed staff are attacked 23 times a day on average. There were 8,429 assaults on prison staff last year, a rise of more than a fifth on the previous year. Self harm is also rife, with 44,651 incidents last year, up by 11% compared with 2016. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers\u2019 Association, has accused the government of being misleading after announcing the recruitment of 2,500 new prison officers. He warned that even with the latest increase, the prison service remained 3,789 officers down since 2010. Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned recently that \u201csafety in prisons is being compromised\u201d as a result of persistent budget cuts. Earlier this year, an Observer investigation found two-thirds of prisons in England and Wales are providing inmates with inadequate conditions or unacceptable treatment. Analysis of hundreds of inspections covering 118 institutions found that a staggering 68% are providing unsatisfactory standards in at least one respect, with two in five jails deemed to be unacceptably unsafe. Labour analysis of official data shows that total prison officer experience stood at 297,462 years in March 2010, 232,151 years in December 2016 and 225,724 years in December 2017. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, said the figures were \u201ctruly shocking\u201d. He added: \u201cIt will take years to replace this vital experience that was built up over the decades but which is now lost for good thanks to reckless Tory policies. Tory cuts have left our prisons more dangerous than ever, with a dangerous cocktail of inexperienced officers and experienced prisoners. This ultimately leaves the public less safe as our prisons are failing to do their job of rehabilitating prisoners. \u201cThe government needs to urgently launch measures to end this exodus of experienced prison officers. It should start by ending the real-terms pay cut that prison officers face this year.\u201d A Prison Service spokesman said: \u201cWe are significantly exceeding our prison officer recruitment targets, which is vital to ensuring prisons are safe, secure and decent so they can successfully rehabilitate offenders. \u201cBut it is also important that we retain experienced staff members, and we continue to work with governors to ensure this happens.\u201d The government has said it has passed its target of recruiting an additional 2,500 prison officers by the end of 2018. An additional 3,111 prison officers were in place at the end of March 2018 than were in post in October 2016, it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
