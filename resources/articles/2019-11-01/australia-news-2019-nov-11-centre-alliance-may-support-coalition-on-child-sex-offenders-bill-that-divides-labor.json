Labor, still in the grips of postmortems after its scathing internal election review, supports the intent to increase penalties but faces a difficult choice because the attorney general, Christian Porter, has signalled the government is unwilling to drop mandatory sentences. As senators return to Canberra for a Senate-only sitting week, the Law Council has accused the Coalition of attempting to wedge Labor with the legislation, while Labor will attempt to move on from the review by labelling itself the party of growth and targeting the government for its refusal to stimulate the economy. Senators Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff told Guardian Australia that Centre Alliance had not finalised its position on the sexual crimes against children bill. Griff said that although there was \u201cstrong public support\u201d for mandatory minimums, the legal fraternity opposed them. The party would consider whether increasing maximums was sufficient to ensure \u201csignificant penalties\u201d for serious offences without mandatory minimums, he said. Patrick said Centre Alliance was concerned the sexual crimes against children bill would result in an 18-year-old who sends naked images to a 15-year-old receiving a minimum five-year sentence. The party is considering asking the government to create separate categories of offences so only the most serious receive mandatory minimum sentences. \u201cOur position is: anyone who interferes with a child ought to get a custodial sentence,\u201d he said. Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told Guardian Australia Labor \u201cstrongly supports the intent of sentencing reforms\u201d to reflect the seriousness of child sex offences. \u201cBut we are concerned that mandatory sentencing undermines the effectiveness of this bill,\u201d he said. In a dissenting Senate committee report, Labor has called for mandatory minimums to be removed but caucus has yet to decide if it will block the bill if the demand is not met. \u201cEvery non-government witness who gave evidence at the public hearing of the committee supported the suggestion that the bill proceed without mandatory minimum sentences,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cIn the interests of protecting our children, Labor strongly urges the government to heed this advice.\u201d The Law Council president, Arthur Moses, said \u201cmandatory sentencing sounds like getting tough on crime but it is pure rhetoric\u201d and there was \u201cno evidence\u201d it reduced crime. \u201cParliamentarians should not be wedged into supporting measures that won\u2019t work but will throw up a range of unintended consequences.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Porter said that mandatory sentencing was the \u201cone guaranteed mechanism \u2026 that can ensure child sex offenders stay behind bars for longer\u201d. \u201cIt is time that Labor made the hard choices to support mandatory sentencing of child sex offenders.\u201d Despite its hesitation over the child sexual offences bill, Labor has been consistent in its opposition to the union penalties bill, which leader Anthony Albanese on Sunday labelled an \u201cattack on the organisations that go into workplaces that deal with issues like wage theft\u201d. Albanese told ABC\u2019s Insiders that he had always supported \u201caspiration\u201d and Labor\u2019s task is to \u201censure that we\u2019re the party of wealth creation \u2013 not just concerned about distribution\u201d. The language echoes the findings of the internal review that Labor did not craft and convey a persuasive jobs and economic growth story that augmented its mission to reduce inequality. On Monday the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will accuse the Morrison government of a \u201ccancer of complacency\u201d as it appears \u201cfrozen in the headlights\u201d in the face of slowing growth. Chalmers will tell the John Curtin Research Centre that the choice between growth that is strong and growth that is fair is \u201cfalse\u201d. \u201cThe world\u2019s best economists have come around to Labor\u2019s long held view that growth is stronger when it is fair \u2013 when more people have a stake in it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe champion growth and redistribution, not growth or redistribution.\u201d In a draft of the speech, Chalmers warns that growth is \u201ctoo weak, too uncertain, and too narrow\u201d and is not \u201ctrickling down to the people nor out to the suburbs\u201d. \u201cThe Australian economy needs responsible, proportionate and measured stimulus to get it going again.\u201d Chalmers will accuse the Coalition of prioritising \u201cpolitical posturing over policy action\u201d, \u201cstubborn, smug inaction\u201d, in reference to its refusal to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy in addition to interest rate cuts, and persistent \u201canti-union rhetoric\u201d. The Coalition is also banking on Centre Alliance to pass its union penalty bill, after the minor party offered support in return for a range of amendments that lift the threshold for deregistration of unions and disqualification of their officials. Patrick told Guardian Australia the minor party is \u201cclose to finalising an agreement\u201d whereby the bill\u2019s penalties and the proposed public interest test for union mergers will all be subject to a demerit point system. An individual would be liable for deregistration if they accrue 180 court-ordered penalty units for legal breaches, while unions would be liable if they reach 900 points. Porter said drafting of amendments is advanced and he looks forward to the bill being debated in the Senate as soon as is reasonably possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
