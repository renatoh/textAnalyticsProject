The psychology professor from Toronto said that Carl Benjamin, the failed Ukip MEP candidate who speculated about raping the Labour MP Jess Phillips, had agreed to test the subscription-only site, named Thinkspot. Peterson has a cult following among rightwingers for controversial views about identity politics and has become a hate figure for many on the left. Earlier this year the University of Cambridge rescinded an offer of visiting fellowship to Peterson after backlash from staff and students. Peterson said he hoped the site would be a censorship-free alternative to Patreon, an online membership service that at one stage made the Canadian $80,000 per month. He said: \u201cIt\u2019ll be a subscription service. And so that\u2019s partly what makes it a replacement for Patreon to some degree, because we want to be able to monetise creators.\u201d The terms of service for the new site take an extreme position on free speech. Peterson said: \u201cOnce you\u2019re on our platform, we won\u2019t take you down, unless we\u2019re ordered to by a US court of law. That\u2019s basically the idea. So we\u2019re trying to make an anti-censorship platform.\u201d Peterson, who describes himself as a \u201cprofessor against political correctness\u201d said that Benjamin, who blogs under the name Sargon of Akkad, was one of a handful of controversial figures who had been invited to test the initiative. He said: \u201cI think we\u2019ve got four, five or six people who are lined up. [Dave] Rubin is going to use it. I\u2019m going to use it, James Altucher, Jocko Willink, Michael Shermer, oh and Carl Benjamin, Sargon of Akkad. They\u2019ll be our first beta testers fundamentally.\u201d Peterson called for more testers of the site on his Twitter account. He said: \u201cI\u2019m backing a new platform called Thinkspot, currently in beta. Get on the waitlist here, exciting announcements coming very soon.\u201d Comments on the site would be voted on by users on a thumbs up or down basis. \u201cIf your ratio of down votes to up votes, falls below 50/50, then your comments will be hidden,\u201d Peterson said. He said there were still problems on the site to iron out, but added: \u201cIt would be nice to have a censorship-free platform if we could figure out how to do that.\u201d \u2022 This article\u2019s subheading was amended on 24 June 2019 to change the description of Jordan Peterson from a \u201crightwing academic\u201d to a \u201ccontroversial academic\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
