Danny's expertise about search engines is often sought by the media, and he has been quoted in places like the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, Forbes, the New Yorker and Newsweek, and ABC's Nightline. Danny began covering search engines in late 1995, when he undertook a study of how they indexed web pages. The results were published online as Webmaster's Guide To Search Engines, a pioneering effort to answer the many questions site designers and internet publicists had about search engines. Danny currently heads up Search Engine Land as editor-in-chief, which covers all aspects of search marketing and search engine news. Danny also serves as Third Door Media's chief content officer, which owns Search Engine Land and the SMX: Search Marketing Expo conference series. Danny also maintains a personal blog called Daggle and microblogs on Twitter: @dannysullivan."}, "isHosted": false}}}
