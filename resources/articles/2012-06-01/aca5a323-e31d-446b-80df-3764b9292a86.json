The announcement will come on the day that new statistics show that Labour's effort to halve child poverty by 2010 has been missed by hundreds of thousands. In a speech setting out his thinking, Duncan Smith will stress that he is not abolishing Labour's child poverty target, which is enshrined in law and commits the government to ensure that there are no children in households where income is 60% or less of median income. But Conservative sources said the target could not be reached even if \u00a319bn of extra income were poured into anti-poverty measures such as tax credits. Promising to deliver \"a better set of indicators\", Duncan Smith will say: \"We remain committed to the targets set out in the Child Poverty Act, but it is increasingly clear that poverty is not about income alone.\" A collection of Labour and Tory thinkers have expressed doubts about the target, saying it is a measure of inequality and in a period of recession the government can get closer to reaching the target even though absolute poverty can be on the rise. Frank Field, the former labour welfare minister, has been deeply critical of the target, and has proposed a range of other life-chances indicators, such as school readiness and child birth weight. Duncan Smith's former thinktank, the Centre for Social Justice, has also proposed a range of non-income measures. In opposition, David Cameron said relative income poverty did matter. Iain Duncan Smith will point out that the last government spent \u00a3150bn on tax credits alone between 2004 and 2010. \"Overall, the welfare bill increased by some 40% in real terms, even in a decade of rising growth and rising employment. Yet for all the extra money, the earlier and easier successes were followed by flatlining results,\" he will say. \"By this narrow measure, if you have a family who sit one pound below the poverty line, you can do a magical thing. \"Give them one pound more, say through increased benefit payments, and you can apparently change everything \u2013 you are said to have pulled them out of poverty. Yet moving someone from one pound below the poverty line to one pound above it might be enough to hit a target. He will argue that increased income from welfare transfers is temporary if nothing changes. \"Take the example of a poor family where the parents are suffering from a drug addiction. Giving the parents extra money moves them over the line and out of 'poverty' on paper. \"Yet because much of the money will almost certainly go on drugs, the family still lives in poverty. Coming off drugs is a therefore a vital step for them getting out of poverty and staying there.\" He will say work is the best route out of poverty, since it makes individuals responsible for themselves and their families, helps them play a productive part in their community, and creates an environment where success through hard work is celebrated, so that children can aspire to even more. He will claim: \"Universal credit will ensure that the vast majority of children will be lifted out of poverty if at least one parent works 35 hours a week at the minimum wage \u2013 or 24 hours if they are a lone parent. \"Today, I am pleased to announce that the government is very interested in developing better measurements of child poverty, which include income but do more to reflect the reality of child poverty in the UK today.\" Neil O'Brien, the director of the thinktank Policy Exchange, welcomed the move, saying: \"Having a child poverty target is right, but the current target needs to change. It has pushed politicians towards short-termist solutions to poverty, and spending more on benefits. We need targets which address the root causes of poverty like worklessness and poor education.\" Responding to Duncan Smith's announcement shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: \"In a great country like Britain we should stand behind parents fighting to bring up their children free of the curse of poverty. Behind Cameron's promises we learn today that those parents and their children will now be abandoned and told, 'you are on your own'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
