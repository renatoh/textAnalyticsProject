Not necessarily for their gastronomic virtues, of which there are many, but for the simple reason that they make me look like a vaguely competent vegetable gardener. My second year as an allotment-holder is not going well. Thanks to unforgivable neglect during the crucial May-June period when all is mad growth, I am now fighting a desperate rearguard action against weeds and pests. Eagerly awaited peas and lettuces were utterly devoured by slugs, weevils and probably mice, and other crops are engaged in an unequal struggle with bindweed. But the broad beans are standing proud and cropping copiously, because that is what broad beans do. Push the seeds in the ground in either autumn (for earlier crops) or spring, and wait. That is about all there is to their cultivation. No need for pesky sticks or canes: broad beans stand up on their own. Apart from ease of growing, and the fact that they add fertility to the soil, another good reason for growing your own broad beans is that you get the option of multiple crops through the year. The young pods can be eaten whole in the spring; in early summer the tender young beans provide a fresh, nutritious side vegetable or salad ingredient. Then, as the season progresses, the beans need to be skinned to reveal the tender, bright-green bean within. On the whole, the broad beans that you buy in the shops will be in this state. And at the end of the season, the mature, wrinkled bean is good for either drying or making into hearty soups. Another reason for growing your own is freshness. Broad beans share with other members of the legume family a tendency to deteriorate in quality soon after picking, as the sugars turn to starch, so your own backyard crop gives you the best guarantee of freshness. And if you're lucky enough to get a glut (which even I managed last year), broad beans freeze well if they are blanched first. \u00b7 21st-Century Smallholder by Paul Waddington is published by Eden Project Books, price \u00a312.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
