There is a broadcast this evening at 9.30 and it should be on the iPlayer for a few days after that. It's wrong to boast, but this does contain, towards the end, the most moving five minutes of radio I have ever recorded. They even ended up on Youtube with a ghastly inspirational picture in front of them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
