Blighted, incessantly it seems, by injury, Harmison was making only his third appearance of the Second Division campaign but made up for lost time at Darlington with three early strikes as the visitors set off confidently in pursuit of the 299 runs that would have thrust them back to the head of the promotion queue. Instead, Harmison had Michael di Venuto and Andrew Gait caught behind in the space of five balls and then bowled Tom Lungley. Guile had the final say, the off-spinner Nicky Phillips taking the last three wickets without conceding a run as Derbyshire fell 89 short. Paul Franks has spent the past two summers forming close personal relationships with physios and surgeons but he brushed off the cobwebs with a vengeance at Trent Bridge, claiming match figures of nine for 91 against Glamorgan as Nottinghamshire gained their second victory since sacking their manager, Clive Rice. Only while Matthew Maynard and Adrian Dale were adding 96 for the sixth wicket did the visitors look capable of prolonging the contest, whereupon the last five wickets oozed away for 15. The winning target of 97 was met with seven wickets in hand. The seemingly insatiable Middlesex batsmen endured a rare day of humility at Southgate. Squandering an opening alliance of 146 between Sven Koenig and Andy Strauss, the likes of Owais Shah and Ed Joyce faltered as the spin of Gloucestershire 's Ian Fisher and Martyn Ball reduced them to 232 for eight, seven short of saving the follow-on, before Simon Cook and Ian Jones saved them. Enterprise finally entered the equation at Grace Road, Leicestershire recovering from 81 for five to reach 300 for nine against Hampshire before declaring 11 behind. Neil Burns made his first century of the summer, sharing stands of 107 with Michael Bevan (62) and 83 with Phil DeFreitas, who then followed up a buccaneering 44 with three early incisions, inflicting ducks on Will Kendall and John Crawley. Daffy, yes, past it - assuredly not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
