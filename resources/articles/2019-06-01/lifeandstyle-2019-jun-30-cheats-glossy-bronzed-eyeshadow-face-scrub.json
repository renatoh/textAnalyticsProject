Makeup artist Diane Kendal used 10 eye products to achieve this look. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that. So cheat. Line your eyes with a dark liner, brush a smidgen of lip salve across the eye lid, add a bronzy shade to the socket and blend a lighter shimmery one on top.

A face scrub that isn\u2019t actually a scrub at all I recoil in horror when anyone tells me that they use face scrubs. The problem is that most are badly formulated and most people over-scrub, creating micro tears in the skin so, essentially, you end up with worse skin than you had to start with. So my response to \u2018Should I be using a face scrub?\u2019 is always a reverberating no. If you need to exfoliate, I suggest using a liquid exfoliator. Still, I accept that some women just like a scrub. So if you must use one, try this. Paula Begoun, the founder and formulator behind it, is known for her frankness concerning products and formulations. She famously calls out beauty BS and what she doesn\u2019t know about skincare could fit on the top of a pipette. She is the only person who could have convinced me to even contemplate a \u2018scrub\u2019. Why? Because this doesn\u2019t actually \u2018scrub\u2019. It is a mild, super-gentle skin-softening cleanser/scrub hybrid with jojoba beads that completely disintegrate as you rub them into your skin. If you\u2019re wearing heavy makeup, it\u2019s worth taking it off first and, no, it won\u2019t replace a liquid exfoliation. However, you will have softer, irritation-free skin because this scrub,that doesn\u2019t really scrub, ensures you could never over scrub. Clever.
