Not so in Tom Piper\u2019s design for Dominic Hill\u2019s bruising revival, a co-production between Glasgow\u2019s Citizens and Manchester\u2019s Home. His set is a skeletal outline, just scaffolding, precipitous staircases and transparent walls. It looks provisional and unfinished \u2013 unattractive even \u2013 and it has an alarming effect. Because every time someone is out of the room and every time the conversation turns to them \u2013 which is nearly always \u2013 you\u2019re convinced they\u2019ll be able to hear. They seem certain to be within earshot of every heated exchange, sure to stumble in and make a volatile situation worse. \u201cThis is not a jail,\u201d says patriarch James Tyrone at one point, yet his wife and sons seem to have imprisoned themselves in a place where they cannot escape each other. They are convicts held by their own family bonds. There is also an appropriate theatricality about Piper\u2019s sketchiness \u2013 it\u2019s the idea of a house, not the house itself \u2013 because the Tyrones are forever role-playing. It\u2019s not just that James is a sometime stage star who has cajoled his eldest son, Jamie, to enter the profession. It\u2019s also that all of them insist on masking their true selves. Where James acts big but has wasted his talent and Jamie walks tall but has underachieved, mother Mary is in denial about her morphine addiction, and younger son Edmund \u2013 a close fit for O\u2019Neill himself \u2013 tries to conceal the symptoms of consumption. It\u2019s the things they hide that make them at once needy and vulnerable, drawn to the very people who will tear them apart. In a play full of spite, recrimination and rage, there\u2019s a surprising amount of hugging and cuddling that goes on in Hill\u2019s production. It\u2019s a constant push and pull of pain and affection. In a recent interview, Hill said the play was \u201cessentially four tragedies in one show\u201d and he duly fields four heavyweight actors (not forgetting a witty Dani Heron as the maid) to punch the drama home. Lorn Macdonald\u2019s Edmund is wiry and resigned, the sickly and sensitive young poet who feels duty-bound to hold his dysfunctional family together, yet revealing his true colours in his moments of focused fury. As big brother Jamie, Sam Phillips has a fearsome presence, hunched like he\u2019s ready to lash out, unyielding in his stare and with a demeanour as dry and bitter as the whiskey he knocks back in such quantity. With fingers crunched by rheumatism, Br\u00edd N\u00ed Neachtain\u2019s Mary switches from the banal to the protective to the vindictive by the sentence. The more evasive \u2013 and more stoned \u2013 she becomes, the more she addresses her lines to the floorboards. Best of all is George Costigan as James, forever checking himself in his bouts of explosiveness, bringing his anger under control until it erupts irrepressibly again. It\u2019s all delivered at a stormy conversational speed, lines frequently bursting out on top of each other, with an emotional exposure that can be excruciating to watch. In its sense of dark and relentless existential despair, it echoes Hill\u2019s earlier productions, ranging from Crime and Punishment to the plays of Samuel Beckett; bleak, feverish and compelling.
