Alan never did", "bodyText": "Alan Coren liked to tell the story of how he had been invited to lunch at Buckingham Palace. He was late, and was stopped by a policeman for speeding. \"You're not going to believe this, officer,\" he said, \"but I am going to lunch with the Queen.\" The policeman glowered. \"What are you, sir, some kind of humorist?\" Well, yes, he was, and probably the finest and funniest British humorist of his generation. The outlets seemed endless. He wrote for and later edited Punch, until being eased out by the idiots who took it over and later crushed the magazine. He wrote books, of which the best known was Golfing For Cats. He'd worked out that cats, golf and the Third Reich were the most popular subjects of that time, so they put a golfing cat and a swastika on the front. Today's equivalent might be The Incest Diet. There was Call My Bluff, a highly successful rehash of the old Robert Robinson, Frank Muir and Denis Norden show. And of course The News Quiz on Radio 4. In the space of two years, that show has suffered two shattering blows, with the deaths of Alan and, last year, Linda Smith. I first met Alan in 1979. Margaret Thatcher had just entered Downing Street and he wanted to revive Punch's tradition of a political column. I particularly relished the atmosphere at the Punch table, the celebrated weekly lunch. Alan loved having royalty there - the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Anne had attended - and this reflected one side of his character; like many people from essentially immigrant families he yearned for the imprimateur of Britishness, which he never let get in the way of a pretty merciless examination of what Britishness really meant. At the first lunch I attended he kicked off by pointing out that everyone wrote books about what would have happened if Germany had won the war, but nobody ever asked what life would have been like if Italy had won the war. And the riff was hilarious, involving, naturally, Nelson's column being replaced by a gigantic pepper mill. On another occasion the entire table - cartoonists, writers, guests, executives - stopped talking as Alan, Keith Waterhouse and Barry Humphries started a sort of comedy jam session. I remember thinking they might have been the three funniest people in Britain at that moment. I couldn't take a note; it would have broken the spell. Alan had been on The News Quiz almost from the beginning. I chaired it for two years back in the early 1980s when it was still essentially a programme featuring journalists and inevitably less funny than it is today. So I thanked the heavens for Alan who invariably finished with gags that left the audience roaring. I can still see him listening, apparently with only half attention, doodling on a pad - then a gleam in the eye when comic inspiration struck, as it did almost every time. Some humorists are miserable souls, hoarding their jokes like misers, to be disbursed in their work. Alan never did. I remember going into a studio, where I'd left my briefcase. \"I see Von Stauffenberg's already here!\" he said. He could be down, though even in his last illness he flogged himself to be cheerful, if only to make life slightly less unbearable for his grieving family. When I heard that death was inevitable and near I wanted to write to tell him how many millions of people he had never met would be shattered by his passing. But it was too late; the morphine had taken over that endlessly inventive mind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
