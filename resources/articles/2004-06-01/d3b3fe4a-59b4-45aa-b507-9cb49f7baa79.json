On the eve of the publication of the BBC's own submission towards the charter review, the culture secretary said she had not ruled out halving the charter from 10 years to five. Urged by MPs during parliamentary question time to emphatically reject calls for a shortened five-year deal, Ms Jowell said all aspects of review were still open. \"[We] will be considering all aspects of the charter, including its length, in the current review - we've drawn no conclusions about that yet,\" she said. Later a spokesman stressed that Ms Jowell was merely responding to a question in the house about the length of the licence. \"She wasn't giving a nod, a nudge or a wink to anyone. People should not read anything into this. She was merely saying yes, she will be looking at everything.\" Ms Jowell's comments follow recent demands by many commercial companies to shorten the recent 10-year charter pattern because of the rapid changes in television including the growth of Freeview. Views on the backbenches were mixed today. John Grogan, Labour MP for Selby, said a 10-year renewal would be a good idea arguing it would be \"a strong sign of parliament's confidence in the need for a strong, independent BBC with a renewed commitment to public service broadcasting\". \"If a five-year charter is granted, as some would advocate, it would create great uncertainty and inhibit the BBC's ability to plan for its role in broadcasting, post digital switchover,\" he added. Michael Fabricant, the Conservative MP for Lichfield and a member of the current media select committee, urged Ms Jowell to \"avoid siren voices\" suggesting the charter should be shorter because that would enable the BBC to react more quickly to changes in the market. \"It's just as difficult for the BBC, as it is for any other organisation, to plan ahead and give good programming if a charter is reduced to just five years. \"If the BBC is going to provide its public service remit, a 10-year period really would be necessary.\" The culture secretary said she was \"well aware of the arguments\" for granting the BBC a further 10-year deal but said: \"This and all other aspects on the BBC's governance and financing are currently subject to the process of review of its charter. The only certain outcome will be a BBC that is strong and independent of government.\" Views among broadcasters are mixed. The corporation's rivals in advertising, radio, the internet and music said the speed of technical change and the potential upheaval in the market caused by the switch-off of analogue TV means an earlier review of the BBC is necessary. But in its submission to a parliamentary committee investigating the future of the BBC, rival broadcaster ITV said a 10-year licence period was desirable and would offer a degree of stability. \"We believe that this charter ought to be renewed for a 10-year period in order to provide the BBC with sufficient time and certainty to implement the changes to funding, regulation, governance and remit that we hope will result in this charter review process,\" it said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
