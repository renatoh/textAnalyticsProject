Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, stressed that his organisation was politically neutral and not seeking to criticise any one party. But pointing to examples of potentially misleading campaigning, Hopson noted that the level of NHS funding increases promised by the Conservatives would do no more than maintain current provision, rather than take the NHS to \u201csunlit uplands\u201d. Asked about Labour\u2019s warnings on NHS privatisation, Hopson said the debate around outsourcing had to be framed around the point that much of this took place anyway, and that some private provision was seen as working well, for example hospices. \u201cWhat really worries us, if you look back over the last four or five elections, the debates about our health and care systems have generated extreme amounts of heat and very little light,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWhat we\u2019re very keen to do is ensure that as we start to think about that debate in the general election campaign, we frame it in the right way.\u201d The NHS is expected to dominate much of the domestic policy debate during the campaign. Given the popularity of the service, \u201cyou can see why politicians would want to wrap themselves in the mantle of the NHS and show how they are it\u2019s biggest champions, it\u2019s biggest defenders\u201d, Hopson said. \u201cWhat we are saying is: let\u2019s have a proper, mature, evidence-based debate about what the NHS needs, and let\u2019s not resort to the cheap political slogans, and skimming across the top, which is what we\u2019ve seen over the last four or five elections.\u201d In discussing the current plans to increase the real-terms NHS budget by an average of 3.4% a year, it was important to be \u201chonest about what the extra funding is going to buy\u201d, Hopson said. \u201cOne of the worries we have is that everybody is running around saying that this extra money now takes us to the sunlit uplands and that it\u2019s all going to be fantastic. The reality is, it\u2019s an amount of funding that just enables us to keep up with demand.\u201d A key Conservative pledge has been to create six extra hospitals, with seed finding for others. However, hospitals were not the only issue, he argued: \u201cThe NHS has a whole range of capital needs. It\u2019s not just about acute hospitals, it\u2019s actually also about mental health facilities, community and ambulance facilities. So we need a debate about how you cover all of the NHS\u2019s capital needs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
