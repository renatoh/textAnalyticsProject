Tempest, a poet, rapper and actor, will present Paradise, a reimagining of Sophocles\u2019 Philoctetes, as part of a season in which eight of the 15 productions are written by women. Clint Dyer will become the first black British artist to have written, directed and starred in National Theatre productions when Death of England, created as a microplay for the Guardian and the Royal Court, opens in February 2020. The play focuses on a working-class man coming to terms with the death of his father, and touches on ideas of race, sport and identity. Rafe Spall starred in the original play and will reprise his role for the new production, which is a 90-minute one-man show. \u201cWhat we\u2019re exploring is identity, a sense of powerlessness, of the guilt and shame that we have as a nation, especially about our inertia,\u201d Dyer said in 2014. \u201cThe play highlights our anger at not feeling good enough about ourselves and the blame we apportion to other people for our own inabilities.\u201d On Thursday Dyer told the Guardian that in a post-Brexit world the issues brought up in the original microplay resonated more. \u201cAt the time there were people saying \u2018Oh God, the football stadiums are different now, why are you always going on about racism?\u2019 Now they understand. In the stadiums we still feel it, in the job market we still feel it, in the world we still feel it.\u201d Dyer said becoming the first black British artist to have written, starred in and directed at the National Theatre was a huge achievement. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing. I suppose within that it isn\u2019t the usual question of \u2018why\u2019s it not happened before?\u2019 I can\u2019t think of anyone else apart from Simon McBurney and Harold Pinter. It\u2019s a very exclusive club and I\u2019m very proud of it as an artist, regardless of colour. It\u2019s a brilliant achievement and really unusual.\u201d The US playwright Annie Baker will premiere her play The Antipodes and is one of six women who will direct during the season. Katy Rudd directs an adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane; Fiona Buffini directs her sister Moiras play Manor; Melly Still directs My Brilliant Friend; Nadia Fall directs Three Sisters; and Chloe Lamford co-directs The Antipodes with Baker. \u201cWith My Brilliant Friend, Paradise and Manor we\u2019re seeing the major stages dominated by female artists for the first time in the theatre\u2019s history,\u201d said the National\u2019s co-chief executive Rufus Norris. \u201cAdaptations of classics are a theme and it\u2019s fantastic to have Kate Tempest make her debut.\u201d After it unveiled its previous season in March the theatre was heavily criticised as all six plays were written by men and only one was directed by a woman. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is us putting our hands up and saying we got it wrong,\u201d said Lisa Burger, the other co-chief executive. \u201cWe should have been better prepared to talk about balance in the announcement we were making. We\u2019ve got much better at representation and this season shows that.\u201d April De Angelis\u2019s adaptation of Elena Ferrante\u2019s My Brilliant Friend, which was made for television in 2018, will come to the Olivier theatre. Fall, who is Theatre Royal Stratford East\u2019s artistic director, will direct Inua Ellams\u2019 adaptation of Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters, which will be relocated to Nigeria, and her play Welcome to Iran will come to the National in May 2020. Burger said: \u201cThis season shows that British theatre is thriving and well. I\u2019m really proud of the range of the work that we\u2019ve got here, with big themes.\u201d Tony Kushner\u2019s adaptation of Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt\u2019s The Visit will star Lesley Manville, and Maxine Peake will star in Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s The Welkin alongside Cecilia Noble. Another playwright making her National Theatre debut is Francesca Martinez with All of Us, which she also stars in and which is directed by Ian Rickson. The lineup is completed by Richard Bean and Oliver Chris\u2019s new play Absolute Flies Again; Alexander Zeldin\u2019s Faith, Hope and Charity; Chris Bush\u2019s adaptation of Brecht\u2019s The Caucasian Chalk Circle; and Robert Lepage directs a new edition of Ex Machina\u2019s epic The Seven Streams of the River Ota. Burger and Norris also announced the National Theatre Collection, which will give libraries, schools and universities access to some of the 10 years\u2019 worth of NT Live productions that were originally shown in cinemas around the UK. The service will go live in September and feature Simon Godwin\u2019s version of Twelfth Night, starring Tamsin Greig, Danny Boyle\u2019s Frankenstein and 13 other plays."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
