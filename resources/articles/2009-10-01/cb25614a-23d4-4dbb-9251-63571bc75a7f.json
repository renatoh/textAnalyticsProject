Nintendo announced a black model earlier but perhaps more interesting are the snippets that Mario and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto let slip in an interview with, er, Popular Mechanics. Ok, it's hardly earth shattering news but the successor to the Wii is likely to be smaller than the current version. With both the Wii remote itself and Wii Motion Plus, what we've been able to do is introduce an interface that is both I think appealing and at the right price for a broad audience. And while we don't have any concrete plans for what we'll be doing with hardware in the future, what I can say is that, my guess is that because we found this interface to be so interesting, I think it would be likely that we would try to make that same functionality perhaps more compact and perhaps even more cost-efficient. Miyamoto also talks about the upcoming Super Mario Bros multiplayer game for the Wii. The concept for the Wii version from the outset was to make it a multiplayer game, and one thing that we considered was how do we design the game with a difficulty level that is going to be satisfying and accessible to all of those different skill levels? We found that it was very difficult to do. But instead what we looked at was, with the multiplayer ability, giving players the ability to pick up other players and carry them through the level and give novice players other ways to get through a level. Finally we get a little gaze in to the future. I think originally video-game systems were viewed as a toy, and they were something you played with. Whereas now I think we're starting to see a blurring of the lines, where, obviously, the internal guts of a video-game system is essentially a computer, and we're gradually seeing video games moving beyond simply entertainment into other aspects of everyday life. What do you think of Miyamoto's comments then? Smaller Wii likely to tempt you? And will the ability to guide novice players through Super Mario help bridge the divide between gamer and non-gamer like Wii Sports so successfully did?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
