McIlroy\u2019s US PGA success endorsed his status as the world\u2019s No1 player and allowed him to join a select group who have won four majors before the age of 26. McIlroy will be regarded as a key scalp when the United States face Europe at Gleneagles next month but he has no fears over that. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d said McIlroy on the concept of him being targeted by Tom Watson\u2019s team. \u201cI think not just how the Americans view me but how I am viewed in my own team. It is going to be my third Ryder Cup. I am not one of the most experienced guys but I am going to have to be a sort of a leader. I am going to be a talisman and drive us forward. \u201cI am realising I am going to have to accept that responsibility. I am comfortable with that. I am comfortable with everyone who is going to be on the team. In my first couple of Ryder Cups, I maybe felt a bit out of place to put my hand up and offer my opinion because who am I? I am only a rookie. Now it is my third, I have experienced a couple and in a place in the game that sort of warrants I can lead the team. It is a good place to be.\u201d In one of the finest climaxes to a major of all time, McIlroy recovered from being three strokes behind Rickie Fowler on the 10th hole on Sunday to win by one from Phil Mickelson. While Fowler and Mickelson faltered, McIlroy played Valhalla\u2019s back nine in 32. It was an indicator that McIlroy\u2019s mere presence influenced his opponents. \u201cThey made bogeys \u2013 Rickie made a bogey on 14 and then on 16. Phil made a bogey on 16,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI am not saying that my name on the leaderboard in any way affected them but it has to do something, especially with the play I have produced over the last few weeks. It is another thing to have in my locker, knowing that it can maybe affect the guys.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s major tally is now only one behind Mickelson and Seve Ballesteros. \u201cHopefully I get there at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then turn my attention to trying to be the most successful European ever and try to catch Nick Faldo [who has six major wins]. There are a lot of goals on the horizon.\u201d Meanwhile, McIlroy will ensure there is some silverware paraded at Old Trafford this weekend. After spending some time in New York, he will attend Manchester United\u2019s opening Premier League game with Swansea City on Saturday as a guest of his boyhood heroes. \u201cI am going to enjoy this week,\u201d said the 25-year-old. \u201cIt has been a great summer. I am not sure if I am ever going to have another summer like this. I don\u2019t know if I can parade the Claret Jug and the Wanamaker Trophy at the same time at Old Trafford but I will try. That will be a great thrill, and then I\u2019ll come back to the States and get ready for the FedEx Cup. \u201cI want to let this all sink in. It has been an incredible run and one I will always remember. I may never have a summer as good as it has been in 2014. \u201cSatisfaction and joy are the two biggest feelings just now. Satisfaction I was able to win and the manner I won, and joy that I have been able to keep this run of form going. \u201cI said at The Open that I wanted to keep moving forward. I didn\u2019t want that to be the end of the season for me, I wanted to win more. I was able to back up that victory with a win at the Bridgestone Invitational and to come to Valhalla and do it all over again, to win three big tournaments in a row is very satisfying.\u201d Fast-forward eight months and there will be fevered excitement around McIlroy\u2019s attempt to win the Masters. \u201cThere will be a lot of hype, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the only major I haven\u2019t won. I desperately want to win the Green Jacket. \u201cI know that if I play my game and the golf I am capable of, there is no reason I shouldn\u2019t go to Augusta thinking I can win and complete the career grand slam.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
