Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party sought photos as assurance of decommissioning, but the IRA saw the demand as an attempt to humiliate them. It was a striking example of how the use of photographic evidence in the pursuit of truth can be interpreted in widely differing ways. Jean-Luc Godard once said: \"Photography is truth,\" but we cannot always make such assumptions. Just think Abu Ghraib. Photographs etch the images clearly on our minds, but before we ask why, we want to know what really happened. So what does the law say about truth? References to truth do not appear in the index of most legal works relating to any media subject. For the most part, while we require witnesses on the stand to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, the practice can be rather different. Most people find it hard to lie convincingly under oath, but witnesses subjected to skilled cross-examination are given little room for personal accounts or justifications. The conclusion in criminal cases is a verdict \"beyond reasonable doubt\" by judge or jury. In civil cases, the more relaxed \"balance of probabilities\" test applies. In many cases, a judge in a civil case, such as a media issue, will say that he or she prefers the evidence of Mr Smith to Mr Bloggs. That is a judgment on the evidence, but we tend then to ascribe it the badge of truth. The big exception is the law of defamation. Even here, it would be easy to miss the reference to truth because it probably appears under the highly misleading heading of \"justification\". In nearly all cases, it is a good defence to prove that the imputation in respect of which a defamation claim is made is true. This is so even if it is published maliciously. The principle is that the truth will set us free, but things may not be so easy. Truth is still not clearly defined in English defamation law. Indeed, once a defamatory imputation has been established by the claimant, the imputation is presumed to be untrue and it is then for the defence to prove its truth. Even here, there can be a distinction between truth and imputation. Some statements can be made in a way that is true but still give a misleading impression that lowers a claimant in the eyes of others. At other times, while there may be little doubt that a statement is defamatory but many think is true, it can be almost impossible to prove that truth - forcing the defendant who seeks, but cannot prove, the truth to settle a claim for fear of worse to come. There are limits to this. A statement, for example, that a person's affairs are under investigation by the fraud squad has been held not to imply that the person is guilty of fraud. But clearly, words must be chosen carefully. Very often, the statement complained of will consist of fact and opinion. In such cases, the opinion itself has to be shown to be correct in order to show justification. Alternatively, a defence of fair comment might succeed where there is no malice, and the comments, although untrue, would be such that a fair-minded person might have made them on the basis of the evidence. One attribute of a fair-minded person might be to avoid exaggeration, such as elevating a single instance of something to a general adjective. In one case, back in 1849, a verdict of libel against one newspaper did not justify describing its proprietor as \"a libellous journalist\" - a decision that presumably would still be upheld today. Does the truth set us free? As long ago as 1843, a House of Lords select committee proposed to limit the defamation defence of truth to cases where there was some public interest and the publication could be shown to be of benefit to the community. Even then, the committee's recommendations were ignored in this country, although the concept has been taken up in other parts of the world. In one sense, however, our emerging privacy law, driven by the Human Rights Convention, does suggest that even truth may not justify reporting something about an individual which is true but where there is sufficient expectation of privacy and no compelling public concern to justify publication. Truth is not a defence to other legal issues, such as torts or civil wrongs, let alone criminal acts, where a defence of truth would hardly impress a court. Likewise, it is no defence to a copyright claim if a substantial reproduction is taken from someone else's work outside the very limited bounds of fair dealing with acknowledgement. Truth is perhaps not itself an absolute answer, but rather a desired part of finding the right answer. Many people featured in the news recently have faced imminent threats to life, from householders tackling intruders to armed police mistaking a suspect's intentions. Their actions have stirred much debate. A few weeks ago, we also saw pictures of a US marine shooting dead an injured man in Fallujah. Kevin Sites, the photographer, sought to explain why he had controversially released the footage for broadcast. Near the end of his account of the incident he wrote: \"When the Iraqi man in the mosque posed a threat, he was your enemy; when he was subdued, he was your responsibility; when he was killed in front of my eyes and my camera - the story of his death became my responsibility.\" It is a responsibility that few of us would relish. When it comes to it, there are few absolute truths but many critical personal judgments. \u00b7 Charles Boundy is group legal director of Random House and a partner at Fladgate Fielder"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
