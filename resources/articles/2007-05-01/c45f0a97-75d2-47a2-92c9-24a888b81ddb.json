Two years ago the government banned group protests near parliament that were not officially cleared. The effects are not quite as expected. While some MPs complained noisy protesters hampered their work, no liberal could ever be at ease with the ban. Its draconian streak was seen when Maya Evans was convicted in court simply for standing in Whitehall and reading out the names of soldiers killed in Iraq. But far from silencing other awkward voices, the law has worked to amplify them. The police used the legislation to reduce the 130-foot collection of banners disaplayed by anti-war fanatic Brian Haw to a mere 10 feet in length. After they did so, Mr Haw grew in fame and now finds that a Mark Wallinger replica of his full-size original is up for the Turner prize. Meanwhile the comedian and scourge of the establishment Mark Thomas has devised an ingenious way to get round this ass of a law. Individuals choose a cause which is whatever they like - from rights for odd-sock-wearers to a new autumn bank holiday - as long as it is their cause alone. The solo protestors must give forms to the police but once they do so they are free to make their point. Each of the hundreds of parallel protests - which will be seen in Westminster again on Wednesday - has their own cause. But it is by coming together that they provide an absurd retort to restrictions on peaceful protest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
