Many are bright and keen students, but they may languish, unable to read and write, in classes with teachers ill-trained or without the time to support them. The lucky ones have parents with the wherewithal to fight their corner. The rest may easily slip through the educational net to a lifetime of underachievement and poor prospects. This is the reality in Britain today for tens of thousands of children with dyslexia or other learning difficulties. According to government regulations, a child should be given a statement of special educational needs (SEN) within 26 weeks of the parents or schools requesting a local authority assessment. But increasingly, children with moderate and specific learning problems, such as dyslexia, are being told that they must be at least four years behind their peers in literacy to be eligible, or fall into a narrow band of underachievement. This means that children cannot be assessed until they have been at school for at least four years. Brodie Bennett's parents realised that he was slipping behind when the family moved back to England from Belgium two years ago. Brodie, now almost nine, was assessed in April this year by speech and language specialists as having a reading age of less than six. Yet his parents were told he fell within the national average and it would be pointless to apply for a statement. His mother, Helen Bennett, says: \"Brodie is a really bright, creative boy, but there was obviously a serious issue with his literacy. Even though his teachers agreed, we found it impossible to get any progress within the state system. We asked his primary school to arrange for an educational psychologist to assess him, but they said it was pointless. He was simply not far enough behind to get any extra help.\" The Bennetts were told that children living in their area, Bath and North East Somerset, must be at least four years behind before the authority will consider assessing for a statement. Private assessment Frustrated and angry, they had him assessed privately - at a cost of over \u00a3300 - and with the generosity of family members sent him to Calder House, a government-approved \u00a34,000-a-term independent special school for children with specific learning difficulties in Wiltshire. On average, pupils require two years at the school before being able to return to mainstream education. Yet only four of the school's 40 pupils have their places funded by education authorities. Sandra Agombar, Calder House's principal, says the Bennetts' case is typical. \"Not only do children have to be at least four years behind to get an assessment, we have seen families have to fight for years through appeals and tribunals to even get an assessment. \"To not look at the discrepancy between current attainment and potential is a scandal. If a child can't be assessed until they are virtually at secondary school, and then only if they are at the academic level of an infant, then they have wasted the whole of their primary education.\" A spokesman for Bath and North East Somerset council said: \"We cannot comment on individual cases. However, we would like to stress that this LEA does not have a blanket policy. \"The LEA's process for assessing whether an SEN statement should be put together does not rely on children being any particular 'age' behind their peers. The LEA will seek evidence of the pupil's curriculum-related attainments in terms of national curriculum levels and standardised assessments. It is important to note that these 'numbers' are only part of the evidence taken into account when deciding whether to initiate a statutory assessment. \"The council considers the needs of the individual student based on the evidence presented. Families also have the right to request statutory assessment independent of the school and can appeal against any decision not to assess.\" Nicholas Smith, who lives in Wiltshire, is another Calder House parent. He appealed against a refusal by the county council to assess his son. The boy, now almost 10, had already been independently diagnosed as dyslexic, but the local authority continued to maintain he had not fallen far enough behind to warrant assessment. In fact, Wiltshire's policy shows that a child has to be four years behind his peers and have a reading age of less than six years and six months before being eligible for assessment. \"Three years ago, we took him out of the state sector because we could not allow the situation to continue,\" says Smith. \"If local authorities lay down criteria, then they cannot be treating each child as an individual case, as the law requires. It becomes a blanket policy, which is illegal. The whole process seems to be designed to grind parents down.\" A spokeswoman for Wiltshire county council said the four-year literacy criteria was age-related and the local authority offered a number of early intervention strategies to help children who were struggling. \"Schools are able to give one-to-one help, and there is a team of educational psychologists and learning support assistants available to help children with difficulties such as dyslexia. This is available before children are even statemented.\" Smith's son has now been assessed, following an appeal, but he has been refused a statement because of the progress he has made at his new school. His parents now plan to send him to an independent school for his secondary education. \"We had no intention of putting our children through private education, but in the absence of a statement outlining what his specific needs are, we cannot risk him going back into a maintained school with no guarantee of support,\" Smith says. Dr Neville Brown, founder of Maple Hayes school for severely dyslexic children in Lichfield, Staffordshire, says local authorities use a variety of ways to stall the process. \"Back in the early 1980s, Baroness Warnock said in her inquiry on special needs provision that she expected up to 2% of pupils to need a statement. Local authorities have turned this around to mean that a child has to be in the bottom 2% before they can be assessed. It is a scandal, and deliberate misinterpretation.\" Eirwen Grenfell-Essam, from Network 81, a support group, agreed it was taking longer and longer for pupils to get statements. The organisation receives up to 3,000 calls a year from desperate families and is currently advising 45 cases. She says the impact of delays is \"devastating\". Network 81 has been supporting the Williams family, on the Isle of Wight. Maisy, aged six, was born with a congenital degenerative condition and is going blind. Her brother, Jareth, eight, has attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia. Their mother, Lisa, asked for Maisy to be assessed three years ago, but was refused. \"I was being asked for more and more evidence of Maisy's condition, despite having reports and letters from consultants telling them she was going blind,\" she says. Jareth, meanwhile, is now being assessed for a statement, four years after the initial request was made. Too little, too late \"Maisy was finally issued with a statement last September, but frankly it is rubbish. The authority has drawn this out for so long that some of the information is out of date, and Maisy's condition has deteriorated. In parts it is contradictory, and I don't know how any school is supposed to know how to help her as it is so unclear.\" A spokesman for the Isle of Wight Council said it did not comment on individual cases. The Department for Children, Schools and Families says it would be \"extremely difficult\" to draw up a national framework for statementing. Each case should be treated on its merits, it says. A spokesman says: \"The need to statement children is dependent on the local context. Where the local authority has put a lot of effort into skilling the workforce in meeting children's special needs, provides effective support for schools and delegates SEN funding, a child who might need a statement in another area where none of these things apply could have their needs fully met without a statement.\" But Lorraine Peterson, chief executive of Nasen, formerly the National Association for Special Educational Needs, says varying interpretations of regulations by local authorities had resulted in a \"postcode lottery\" of provision. \"We have 150 authorities applying 150 different ways of doing things. This stalling and arbitrary \"four years\" policy is becoming standard practice. Local authorities may be delegating more money to schools, but it isn't ring-fenced. A large secondary might get \u00a3100,000 for SEN, but if it absorbed into the school general budget it will be spent on other things.\" Inez Brown, assistant solicitor at Anthony Collins solicitors in Birmingham, takes up to 25 appeals a year on behalf of children who cannot get statements. Her services cost up to \u00a37,000 for representation at tribunal, much of which will be spent gathering reports and information refuting local authority claims that mainstream provision is adequate. Brown agrees that local authorities' motive for stalling on statements is financial. She says: \"The government needs to rethink its inclusion policies and the way this sector is funded, because these are the forgotten children.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
