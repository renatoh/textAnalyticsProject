This means that as there would not be any money exchanged between the clubs, United valued Mkhitaryan at around \u00a335m, the fee Arsenal were demanding for S\u00e1nchez. S\u00e1nchez, who was out of contract at Arsenal this summer, is expected to sign terms at United that will make him their highest-paid player, with speculation he could earn as much as \u00a314m-a-year after tax or \u00a3500,000-per-week. Despite the high salary, the 29-year-old\u2019s signature is a coup for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as the manager continues to try and revitalise United. After finishing sixth last season Saturday\u2019s 1-0 win at Burnley kept United in second position after 24 matches. With Manchester City\u2019s 3-1 defeat of Newcastle United leaving United 12 points behind Mourinho will hope S\u00e1nchez can help bridge the gap to their rivals. Following Arsenal\u2019s 4-1 defeat of Crystal Palace, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger confirmed the Arsenal player is \u201cup north\u201d where he is expected to undergo a medical. \u201cI didn\u2019t take him because there is question of him moving to Manchester United and you cannot drive up north and as well play football,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s difficult so that\u2019s why I decided to leave him out.\u201d Mourinho said he not spoken to S\u00e1nchez but will welcome adding a world-class talent to a forward line that again lacked ruthlessness against a well-drilled Burnley. \u201cIn this moment there is no competition for places, we have four attacking players for three positions [behind Romelu Lukaku],\u201d he said of Martial, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Juan Mata. \u201cThree are starting, one is on the bench, Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] was not available for [nearly all] the season. We look to the attacking areas and need that extra competitive internal competition and more solutions for us.\u201d Mkhitaryan was in London on Saturday night with his agent Mino Raiola before his medical with Arsenal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
