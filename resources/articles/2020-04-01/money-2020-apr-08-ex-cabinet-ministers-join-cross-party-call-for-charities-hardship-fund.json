Ministers have been under pressure for weeks to extend the financial help offered to businesses to the third sector, amid reports that even the most established organisations are in dire straits as revenue from charity shops and fundraising events dries up during the coronavirus lockdown. A letter signed by 26 MPs from across the political spectrum, including the former Conservative cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Esther McVey, Owen Paterson and Damian Green, called on the government to save the small charitable and community sector \u201cfrom impending collapse\u201d and to rescue the \u201csilent army of life savers\u201d. \u201cWe have seen firsthand their significance in the fight against coronavirus. They provide the infrastructure of voluntary effort to support the most vulnerable, facing greater hardship than ever at this time. Isolated households, those with mental health problems, people experiencing domestic violence, child abuse, loneliness and the extra stress of family dysfunction,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThey are delivering medicines and food to the most vulnerable and in the case of adult and children\u2019s hospices, they are also taking the pressure off our hard-pressed NHS and social care sectors, or stemming the flow of people who would otherwise need more intense medical care in hospitals and much, much more.\u201d With the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, expected to front the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, sources in the voluntary sector said they had been told to expect an announcement on Wednesday \u2013 though some said they had been told that before. There have been reports that the Treasury was preparing a \u00a3100m fund for charities, but this figure has been dismissed as inadequate by many in the sector. By contrast, Barclay\u2019s bank announced on Wednesday it planned to donate \u00a3100m to charities helping in the coronavirus crisis. Cancer Research UK was among a number of leading cancer charities to warn on Tuesday that a shortfall of donations would set back progress on fighting the disease. The organisation said it could lose up to a quarter of its donated income (about \u00a3120m) in the next 12 months, meaning it had drastically to scale back its research plans. Sue Ryder, one of the UK\u2019s biggest providers of end of life care, has similarly warned it may have to close its hospices after the coronavirus crisis blew a \u00a312m hole in its budget. St John Ambulance, which has deployed hundreds of volunteers around the NHS to help tackle Covid-19, also told MPs last week it would run out of money in the next four months. A letter organised by the Labour MP Stephen Doughty two weeks ago, calling for urgent government intervention to help the charity sector, has received 317 signatures from MPs and lords. Doughty, who signed the latest letter, along with the former Labour deputy leader Margaret Beckett, said: \u201cWell over two weeks since the sector and a huge cross-party group made clear the desperate situation facing charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises, many of whom are working on the frontline, it\u2019s disappointing and deeply worrying that clear action has not yet been forthcoming.\u201d He said government financial help should run into billions of pounds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
