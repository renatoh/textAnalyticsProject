How foreigners can survive the US election without complete nervous collapse", "bodyText": "There are only 24 hours to go until the polls close on the American election. Which is surprising, because the campaign feels like it has been going for eleventy-million-billion years. Americans, at least, get to vote. For the rest of the world, the whole experience is like waking up in a cinema that only shows The Fast and the Furious movies, and all of the exits are sealed shut with cement. We\u2019ve been stuck in here with loud noises, annoying characters and zero plot development for months, eating the curtains for food and desperately hoping it all comes to an end without actual loss of life. Or, you know, a massively increased prospect of nuclear war. What it\u2019s like to be trapped in America\u2019s version of that cinema right now is unimaginable. Circumstances suggest it\u2019d involve a lot of audience members holding guns, cheers ringing out whenever stupid lines are delivered and way too much coughing for anyone to feel comfortable. Elections in other countries universally elicit two responses from those foreign to them: \u201cShe seems nice\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s a worry.\u201d Jacinda Ardern may have transformed New Zealand into the world\u2019s idea of Magical Happy Hug Land, but in their last election how many internationals were furiously scanning weighted polling averages at 2am because Wairarapa seemed too close to call? Now, millions of us around the world recently sport what I call the \u201cFiveThirtyEight Pallor\u201d \u2013 a face-bound, sleepless waxiness that results from relentlessly refreshing US poll sites to see if there\u2019s any projected movement in Maine\u2019s second district. Vast hordes of non-farming, non-Americans now intimately familiar with the price of soybeans in Iowa is a terrifying symptom of these anxious times. Is there a way for powerless, poll-watching foreigners to get through the next 24 hours \u2013 and the aftermath \u2013 without complete nervous collapse? Probably not. But let\u2019s delude ourselves into thinking that we can follow the below advice and go through this with a sense of calm. 1. We must admit to ourselves we are powerless over the US, and to think otherwise will make our lives unmanageable As much as you may want scream HOW CAN YOU VOTE FOR THIS LARGE ORANGE CLOWN to Americans visible on Twitter, don\u2019t. This very publication is haunted by the failure of \u201cOperation Clark County\u201d back in 2004, where British Guardian readers wrote letters of persuasion to a swing district of American voters, requesting politely they not vote for George W Bush. \u201cReal Americans aren\u2019t interested in your pansy-ass, tea-sipping opinions\u201d began one of the gentler replies. 2. Prepare American-themed delicacies for the occasion If you\u2019re short on time, grab some traditional spray cheese-in-a-can or some Twinkies, but to really immerse yourself for the US election, follow the YouTube directions to whip up a Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheeto Turkey with all the trimmings. Then, don\u2019t eat this food; stare at it. Stare at the thick, plastic cheesiness. The sugary crustiness. The holy-god-how-is-any-of-this-still-legally-considered-food heart-endangering carbohydration of it all and ask yourself both a) does Britain really want a trade deal with these people? and b) is doing this to human food in any way culturally understandable to you? No. No, it isn\u2019t. Do you think you can intuit their political choices now? No. No, you can\u2019t. 3. Don\u2019t watch Fox News coverage There are those who believe that Fox is some kind of foul, relentless rightwing propaganda hydra managed by a clan of vampiric undead that wilfully spreads lethal misinformation for fun. This is not true. It\u2019s actually a sophisticated marketing operation for mass sales of anti-anxiety medication that no one needs until they watch one single uninterrupted minute of its programming. Save your money, and your cardiovascular health: avoid. 4. Believe the polls: it\u2019s not 2016 any more The 2016 election was a confluence of black swan events: an unpredictable Republican campaign, a polarising Democratic candidate, dark digital operations, WikiLeaks-dumped cache of stolen correspondence, and the FBI\u2019s improbable decision to reopen the dead investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails collided with outdated polling techniques. This year, poll techniques are updated, and as much as the Republicans are trying to make Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop happen, it\u2019s not going to happen. 5. Don\u2019t believe the polls, have you forgotten 2016? Remember the surety everyone had on election day morning that Clinton would be president by night-time and the tiny-pawed tangerine vagina-grabber would be left hustling for gigs on celebrity baking shows and charity golf events? By midnight we were coiled in foetal balls on the living room floor in shock, our cold hands begging for the comfort of a security blanket, or at least a wizard companion to guide us through a new, dark and terrifying realm. 6. Vacuum the living room floor. Locate a security blanket. Order a wizard US polling website Fivethirtyeight.com still gives the carrot-coloured super-spreader a 10% chance of victory. There\u2019s one thing we know about The Fast and the Furious. Just when you think that the franchise is finally finished is when you\u2019ll find out they\u2019re making a sequel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
