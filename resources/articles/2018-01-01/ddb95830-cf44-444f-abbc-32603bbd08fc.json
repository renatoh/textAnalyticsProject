The Oscar-winning actor, fresh off her record-breaking 21st Academy Award nomination for her role in The Post, will join the multi-award-winning drama alongside Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern. Streep will play the mother of Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s character, described as a woman arriving in the town of Monterey looking for answers about what happened to her son. The casting will make her the mother-in-law of Kidman\u2019s character. The two previously starred in The Hours but were never on screen together. Sources have told Variety that she is set to make $800,000 an episode, which follows on from news that returning cast members will see a pay rise for the second seven-episode season. It is reported that Witherspoon and Kidman will take home $1m an episode, up from between $250,000 and $350,000 for season one. The second season will be directed by the acclaimed British film-maker Andrea Arnold, whose credits include Red Road and American Honey. The first season was helmed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, whose latest HBO series, Sharp Objects, will premiere this year. It stars Amy Adams and Patricia Clarkson. Plot details are vague for season two but HBO has stated that the plot will revolve around \u201cthe malignancy of lies, the durability of friendships, the fragility of marriage and, of course, the vicious ferocity of sound parenting\u201d. Big Little Lies has been a major hit for HBO, winning multiple Emmys, Golden Globes and Sag awards. The second season is expected to premiere in 2019. It marks the second forthcoming show that Streep has been attached to, with the actor set to star in JJ Abrams\u2019s show The Nix, based on the novel by Nathan Hill. She will also star alongside Emily Blunt in this year\u2019s sequel Mary Poppins Returns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
