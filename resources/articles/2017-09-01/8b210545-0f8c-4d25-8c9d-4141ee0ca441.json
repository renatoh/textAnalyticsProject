The midfielder was in some pain after being forced off in the 19th minute of United\u2019s opening Champions League group game at Old Trafford. He required crutches afterwards and although Pogba is awaiting the results of tests he is not optimistic. If Pogba does miss a month it would represent a severe blow to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side. The 24-year-old has played a pivotal part in United\u2019s strong start to the campaign \u2013 they lead the Premier League on goal difference \u2013 and on Tuesday he captained the team in the absence of Michael Carrick. He has scored twice, both goals coming in the league. Between now and mid-October United have six matches, four in the league \u2013 against Everton, Southampton, Crystal Palace and Liverpool \u2013 plus a Carabao Cup tie against Burton Albion and a Champions League game against CSKA Moscow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
