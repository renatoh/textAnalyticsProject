It\u2019s a chain of reaction that has now grown routine within the party that controls the three branches of the US government. Hours after Trump defended his right as president to share \u201cfacts\u201d with Russia, which he said pertained to terrorism and airline safety, lawmakers on Capitol Hill sought more details from the White House \u2013 with some calling for the release of transcripts or a briefing before Congress by senior administration officials. But while condemnation poured in from Democrats and a handful of Trump\u2019s familiar critics within his own party, most Republicans had resigned themselves to accept the perpetual state of chaos at the White House. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s less than ideal, but it is what it is,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida told reporters. Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, said it would \u201cbe nice to have a drama-free week\u201d. \u201cBut I suppose it\u2019s going to continue,\u201d he added, \u201cso we\u2019ll have to get used to it.\u201d At a press conference on Tuesday, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, repeated his wish for \u201ca little less drama emanating from the White House\u201d, amplifying the frustration among Republican leaders who feel their policy agenda has been continuously thwarted by Trump\u2019s penchant for controversy. \u201cThese are daily \u2013 not daily, hopefully, but it seems like lately daily \u2013 distractions, and you just have to manage around it,\u201d Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota, told reporters after the conference. \u201cI think our job is to try and stay focused on the things that we want to accomplish.\u201d In a clear sign of contrast between the parties, Senate Republican leaders spent the majority of their weekly press conference speaking about healthcare before taking a handful of questions that McConnell mostly responded to with a one-word answer. Asked if he had any concerns about the president\u2019s ability to handle classified information, McConnell took a lengthy pause, before replying: \u201cNo.\u201d Democratic leaders, speaking directly after the Republicans, used their weekly press conference to sharpen their demands. \u201cThe president should make full, unedited transcripts available immediately ... no ifs, no ands, no buts,\u201d said Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader. \u201cIt may have put national security and our intelligence operation at risk. Congress has the right to know.\u201d Schumer appealed to Republicans as \u201cpatriots\u201d and implored them to join the effort to get the transcripts from the Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Russian foreign minister and ambassador. According to the Washington Post report, there are internal memos and a full transcript from Trump\u2019s meeting with the Russians. McConnell on Tuesday said he had confidence that the Senate intelligence committee would obtain any \u201cadditional information\u201d it found pertaining to its inquiry into Russia\u2019s meddling in the US election. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said the Senate should subpoena all transcripts related to Trump\u2019s meeting with the Russian officials, as well as any tapes the White House may have of the president\u2019s conversation with the former FBI director James Comey, who was fired last week amid the agency\u2019s investigation into potential ties between Trump and Russia. \u201cProsecuting 101: if you think evidence exists, put a subpoena on it,\u201d Blumenthal told reporters. \u201cIf the party says it doesn\u2019t exist, and in fact it turns out later it does, there are criminal penalties.\u201d Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, said the episode underscored the need for an independent panel to investigate potential links between Trump and Russia. \u201cEvery day there\u2019s more questions that need to be answered, including this week, and it really cries out for an independent commission to report to Congress and the American people,\u201d Cardin told reporters. The Washington Post reported on Monday that Trump had shared details of intelligence gathered about an Islamic State threat with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, during a private meeting in the Oval Office last week. The report, which alleged that Trump\u2019s disclosure had to do with an Isis plot involving the use of laptops onboard passenger aircraft, was subsequently confirmed by several news outlets. Most Republicans said they were struggling to understand what had transpired, citing the conflicting statements from Trump\u2019s national security adviser HR McMaster and the allegations contained within the Washington Post report that broke the story. McMaster would not say on Tuesday whether Trump had shared classified information with the Russians, emphasizing instead that what the president had said was \u201cwholly appropriate\u201d. Rubio told reporters as he stepped onto an elevator: \u201cThese were important allegations that were made, but I need to know the truth.\u201d The Republican senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who noted the volume of calls to his office were up slightly as a result of the news, said: \u201cI think we have so much more to discern about what actually happened.\u201d There are currently three separate investigations, by the FBI and the Senate and House intelligence committees, into alleged Russian interference in the November presidential election that the US government has said was designed to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. Republicans have so far resisted calls for a special prosecutor or independent commission, despite nearly 80% of Americans backing such action. In light of Trump\u2019s latest Russia-related controversy, some Republicans agreed it would be useful to have tapes or transcripts made available to members of Congress \u2013 but others threw their unwavering support behind the White House. \u201cI have a lot of confidence in the existing infrastructure on [the] foreign relations committee, a bipartisan group, and our deputy attorney general Rosenstein,\u201d Senator Luther Strange of Alabama told reporters. \u201cI have a lot of confidence in those guys, so we\u2019ll just wait and hear what comes out.\u201d Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi said: \u201cI\u2019m not concerned.\u201d Those who have broken with the administration on a number of issues were more forthcoming in their criticism. Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona and chair of the Senate armed services committee, said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cReports that this information was provided by a US ally and shared without its knowledge sends a troubling signal to America\u2019s allies and partners around the world and may impair their willingness to share intelligence with us in the future.\u201d Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, had said the White House was in a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d when the reports first surfaced Monday evening. On Tuesday, he tempered his response, telling reporters: \u201cThere\u2019s some alignments that need to take place over there, and I think they\u2019re fully aware of that.\u201d For now, Republicans contended with what has become the new normal: awaiting answers from the White House while gleaning information from the media. \u201cIf it\u2019s true this information was shared with the Russian ambassador,\u201d said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, \u201cit seems to me it\u2019d be ok to share with the US Senate.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
