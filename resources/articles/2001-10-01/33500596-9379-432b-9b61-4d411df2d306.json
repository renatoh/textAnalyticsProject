They include two that were released posthumously, after he committed suicide in April 1994, as well as Bleach, the group's 1989 debut, recorded in under a week for $600. The discretion with which his estate has acquitted itself since Cobain's death has undoubtedly heightened the group's appeal. There has been no steady stream of lost concert recordings, boxed sets, newly discovered single or books of poetry such as now trivialise the work of other fallen rock stars like John Lennon, Jim Morrison, Elvis Presley or Jimi Hendrix. Nirvana's six records are all that remain of Cobain's lifetime. Individually, they sound different; together, they articulate rock music as perhaps the most potent historical force in the popular idiom. Nirvana's 1991 single 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' jump started an alternative wave of pop music that had since the mid-Eighties threatened to break into the mainstream. The accompanying album, Nevermind, went on to sell more than 10 million copies. Cobain became America's most legitimate cross-cultural icon since Bob Dylan. He also had little of the self-regard of rock frontmen who had preceded him - Daltrey, Jagger, Morrison, Rotten. Nor was Cobain a working-class icon; unlike Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young, he never donned the mantle of labour rights or anti-capitalism. Perhaps he was, more simply, the next-door loser, a self-confessed under-achiever who would rather get stoned on cheap marijuana than chase skirt. Even in his incredible success - which only lasted three years - he galvanised a generation of like-minded outcasts whoalways felt they could, in turn, admire and emulate his musical triumphs. Heavier Than Heaven, the first authoritative account of the singer's life, makes a compelling point early on. Many teenagers have it worse than Cobain, and many will live out their childhoods and adulthoods with few emotional knots to boast of. And while Cobain was born into loving, lower-middle-class stock north of Seattle - his mother was self-obsessed, his father uncommunicative - his childhood was anything other than abusive. When he was seven, Cobain was briefly diagnosed as hyperactive; the singer later claimed that the subsequent three-month Ritalin course prescribed by a local doctor inaugurated his later drug abuse. Cross's portrayal of a shy but prodigiously gifted child, in artistic as well as musical terms, is a joy to read. From various volumes of Cobain's notebooks and journals, Cross also unearths an early self-loathing that would be the core of the now well-established truism that Cobain was almost destined to take his own life. Two paternal Cobain great-uncles and a paternal great-grandmother had killed themselves, while Cobain boasted to friends of a 'suicide gene' in the family. The burden of his family's history would turn Cobain from a seemingly popular high-school student into a fully fledged drug addict and drop-out, with a petulance and anger that would increasingly surface only in his music and drawings. But what petulance and what anger. Cross, quite rightly, spends a sizeable portion of the book analysing MTV Unplugged, recorded only a few months before Cobain's death. The album contains six cover versions, of which five intimate death. Cross say: 'As the cameras started rolling, Kurt had the expression of an undertaker, an appropriate look as the stage was set for a macabre black mass. Kurt had suggested stargazer lilies, black candles and a crystal chandelier. When Unplugged producer Alex Coletti asked, \"You mean, like a funeral?\" Kurt said that was exactly what he meant.' The author's almost forensic dissection of Cobain's suicidal streak marks the last and most depressing part of Heavier Than Heaven. In the end, suggests Cross, while Cobain's music conquered all, the singer simply couldn't. A hopeless drug addict for all but a few weeks of his public life, he then dragged his wife, singer and actress Courtney Love, into a spiral of heroin abuse. The very fact that Love is now a reconstructed feminist role model, says Cross, surely hints at Cobain's detachment from nearly everything; all six Nirvana albums are now to be viewed through the sweltering pain of the singer's addiction. While Cross refuses to serve judgment - Cobain's suicide was a selfish and ultimate act of abandonment - he does believe that death was a clarification of Cobain's willingness to go it alone. Thankfully, he left us those six glorious records."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
