Just add Tiffany", "bodyText": "I never thought The Asylum could outstrip their own sterling efforts in ridiculously camp monster-moviemaking but they seem to have pulled it off. Just last year, the bargain-basement neo-exploitation schlockmeisters offered us Mega Shark Vs Giant Octopus, with used-up-and-spat-out 1980s micro star Debbie Gibson (who these days prefers to go by \"Deborah\", but the hell with that) gamely essaying the lead role while equipped with absolutely zero thespian talent. This week sees the release of The Asylum's cookie cutter follow-up, magnificently entitled Mega Piranha, starring Gibson's past-her-sell-by-date teen doppelganger Tiffany. And if that doesn't titillate your trashiest membranes, check out their next project, a screen-melting summit meeting of rubber monsters and plastic has-beens, a clash of the time-machine micro-titans: Mega Python Vs Gatoroid! Starring Debbie Gibson and Tiffany! And all on a budget not much bigger than $19.99. Wicked. This being said, there may not be much room for further development on the monster side of this equation. Mega Python Vs Gatoroid? Self-parody is self-parody, but Mega Python just makes me think of John Cleese, while Gatoroid is a Burt Reynolds movie with a rectal ailment attached. And the monsters themselves, despite the fact that 95% of The Asylum's budgets are spent on them, still look terminally cheapjack. So what to do? I say redirect the spotlight from the monsters to the stars themselves. Instead of deteriorating further in the Mothra/Rodan direction until you're making villains out of mega bunny rabbits in offerings whose titles sound like porno movies with well-endowed male leads, reinvest the effects budget in the cast. It's much cheaper: I bet you could get 10 Tiffanys for the price of one giant plastic octopus, so the money would save itself. I envisage an entire series of faceoffs, megajousts and deathmatches between every fad rocker, burnout, has-been and never-was that haunted a pullout poster mag at any point in the 1980s. Imagine the possibilities: Tiffany and Debbie facing off in gladiatorial combat, one brandishing a rolled-up copy of Teen Beat, the other Smash Hits, and tearing each other to shreds! You could have sister-on-sister specials, matching Janet Jackson with LaToya to see how much flesh remained on their bones after the initial contretemps. Or Mr T Vs MC Hammer, with choice lines of dialogue like \"I pity da fool in them pussy-ass pantaloons!\" and the two going at one another with souped-up hairdos, ridiculous period outfits and the same idiotic catchphrases that will harry them unto the grave and probably appear on their headstones to boot. I know I'd pay money to see that. Not good money, mind you, not real money, certainly not more than a fiver. But money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
