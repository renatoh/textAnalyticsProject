And the sauce is good and tangy.\" I have to agree with her, and not just from politeness to the woman holding out the plate so we can try what she has been cooking. They are jolly good. We are not here to be polite, though Susan Heath-Fowler is nothing less than encouraging to everyone. \"This is what we call a quality test,\" she says. Heath-Fowler is a trainer-assessor specialising in the hospitality sector, and this morning she has come to a school in Bloxham in Oxfordshire. She spends a lot of time in school kitchens. Juliane Moreira has been preparing meatballs and spaghetti as part of a lunch menu that includes broccoli and stilton soup, chicken balti curry and a fine looking salad bar. The 25-year-old Brazilian is one of nine people working in this school kitchen. They are being assessed as part of the government's Train to Gain programme. Heath-Fowler explains that her role is to assess each of the nine to see whether they are fit to qualify for a level 2 national vocational qualification (NVQ) in food processing and cooking. Given restrictions on time and what the Train to Gain contract pays, it is not possible to see everybody do everything. It is also a requirement that the assessor tries as much as possible not to disrupt operations and to fit her work in accordingly. Sampling the product There are a lot of boxes to tick. Some of the assessment is based on the records taken by a person's colleagues, some of it on the records the person takes themselves, and some of it is based on sampling the finished product. The rules make clear how many of the techniques for preparing fish, for instance, the assessor has to see with her own eyes. And they insist that one observation is not enough. A second observation on a later occasion is needed. Some techniques might not be observable because they do not form part of a particular kitchen's repertoire. If there are gaps in people's knowledge, she has plenty of material for them to read and workbooks to complete. If people's skills are not up to scratch, the employer is told and it is up to them to put it right. The basic \"lower\" Train to Gain contract does not pay for much beyond assessing, says John Hyde, managing director of Hospitality Industry Training, the firm that employs Heath-Fowler. There is a \"higher\" contract that includes money for some teaching. An assessor always starts off by gauging what a person knows or can do. On the basis of this initial \"skills scan\", the assessor can decide that an individual should be on the higher funding contract and needs at least 20 \"guided learning hours\". Many people working in school kitchens have no formal cooking qualifications. They have learned how to cook as part of day-to-day living and expanded their repertoire on the job. Many of the mature people (Train to Gain is only for those aged 25 and above) working in school kitchens know most of the required techniques, says Heath-Fowler. Any gaps in their knowledge are invariably to do with safety and hygiene regulations. If her experience is typical, not just of those bringing Train to Gain to school kitchens but of the whole of industry, it begs some big questions. For instance, exactly how much training gets done for the half a billion pounds a year the government is spending on its flagship programme for boosting the workforce's skills? A major part of the programme so far has been about measuring what people can do already and giving them qualifications for doing it. It has not been about significantly raising industry's game. Nobody would seriously quibble with this reading. Colleges and private training companies accept that the bulk of Train to Gain work involves assessing and accrediting rather than teaching new skills. Is this audit of the nation's skills - confirming what people can do and giving them a certificate - the best use of taxpayers' money? \"Lord Leitch's idea was that a skills scan of the whole country was needed,\" says Hyde. \"The first two or three years of Train to Gain will be about getting everybody up to a basic level 2 qualification.\" The next step will be starting to work on more advanced skills, Hyde says. According to Chris Humphries, chief executive of the new UK Commission for Employment and Skills, employers are not that bothered about their workforces getting qualifications, but many employees are keen. They provide them with the foundations of a CV and a more effective path to promotion or another job. \"Employers are getting a payback in terms of better staff morale,\" Humphries says. \"One of the biggest bonuses for employers is the readiness and willingness of those employees to do more training.\" An increasingly important factor for the future of Train to Gain is what the Conservatives might do if they win the next election. Conservative threat \"I'm not a fan of Train to Gain,\" says John Hayes, the Conservative skills spokesman. \"Much of the training is not training, it's assessment of needs dressed up as training. And having assessed them, a lot of the certification is accreditation of existing skills. \"It might be reassuring to focus on those things which we can do, but it is not adding value and that is a prerequisite of training - to identify those things we can't do and need to do.\" A recent survey carried out for the Learning and Skills Council showed that more than 90% of employers who had taken part in Train to Gain were happy with it. But no employer, or training company, is going to say no to free money, says Hayes. Assessment and accreditation has always been a large part of what training companies do. Colleges, on the other hand, have largely been in the business of teaching people new skills. There is a serious anxiety among colleges that Train to Gain is radically going to change what they do, says John Stone, chief executive of the Learning and Skills Network. \"If it continues, it will reduce the requirement for people to deliver skills and increase the need for people to accredit skills,\" he says. \"It's not necessarily doing anything for the skills base of the country.\" \u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday July 8 2008.
