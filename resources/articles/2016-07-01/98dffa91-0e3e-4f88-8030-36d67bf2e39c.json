Galaxy asked 1,000 Australian voters \u201cregardless of your views on same-sex marriage\u201d whether they support or oppose a national plebiscite to decide whether same-sex couples should be able to marry. The poll, commissioned by the Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), found 48% of respondents supported the plebiscite, 30% oppose it and 20% are undecided. When told the result of a plebiscite would not be binding and \u201cpoliticians will still need to vote on whether to agree or disagree with what the public has decided, potentially overriding the public\u2019s vote\u201d, support fell to 33%. When told the plebiscite is expected to cost $160m, support came in at 25%. The results are slightly higher than a Centre for Applied Political Psychology (Capp) poll in June, which found 40.4% supported a plebiscite. On ABC\u2019s 7:30 on 8 June, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said \u201cthere is overwhelming support in the community for the plebiscite\u201d. \u201cPeople actually quite like the idea of having their own say in it.\u201d PFLAG national spokeswoman, Shelley Argent, said: \u201cThe government must heed the Australian public by dropping its plan for a costly, damaging and pointless plebiscite and allowing a free vote in parliament asap.\u201d \u201cThe Australian public just voted for a new parliament in which a majority of members support marriage equality.\u201d Australian Marriage Equality national director, Rodney Croome, said: \u201cSupport for a plebiscite has fallen dramatically since it was first mooted in August last year and about 70% of the public backed the idea. \u201cI attribute this to the public being made aware of how costly, unnecessary and damaging it will be,\u201d he said. \u201cTo avoid a plebiscite, marriage equality advocates must continue to educate the public about how a free vote in parliament is the most appropriate and effective way forward.\u201d Coalition MPs who claim majority support cite a Griffith University poll which found that 70% of Australians want the people to have a direct say in the issue of marriage equality. Marriage equality researcher from the University of Queensland, Sharon Dane, has questioned that result \u201cbecause the question was not specific to the issue of allowing same-sex couples to marry\u201d. Argent claims that Coalition MPs have wrongly described the Capp poll as \u201cpush polling\u201d because it also asked questions which included the cost and nonbinding nature of a plebiscite. But an independent assessment of the polling data prepared for Capp by University of Melbourne senior research fellow Denis Muller found the question which showed 40% support for a plebiscite was \u201cunexceptional\u201d and \u201cdoes not contain any element of push polling\u201d. Asked about the poll on Radio National on Thursday, the deputy Nationals leader, Fiona Nash, said she would continue to back a plebiscite. \u201cWe think the best way to address this issue is to give the people a say,\u201d she said. Nash committed to vote in line with the result of the plebiscite when marriage equality was voted on in the parliament. On Monday Turnbull said he would bring legislation to enable a plebiscite as soon as practicable, but the plebiscite may be held in early 2017 rather than this year as he had previously planned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
