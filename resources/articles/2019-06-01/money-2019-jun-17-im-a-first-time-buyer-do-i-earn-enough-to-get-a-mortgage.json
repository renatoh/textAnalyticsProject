I\u2019m 26 years old and single and a couple of years ago, I received a \u00a3150,000 inheritance. I have sat on it since then but have finally come to the decision to buy a one-bedroom flat in London. I was renting until a month ago but am now back living with parents to give me a chance to save enough money for legal costs and furniture while I navigate my options. I am also in the process of finding a new job and expect to have a salary of \u00a332,000, once I have been in the job three months. So sometime in October or November I hope to be in a position to buy a property using the help-to-buy scheme. I expect to pay about \u00a3400,000 split 37.5% deposit, 37.5% help-to -buy and 25% mortgage. I\u2019m nervous that although I would could get a mortgage of 25% of the value of the flat, there\u2019s no guarantee that my salary will increase enough to cover the repayments when they kick in on the help-to-buy equity loan in five years\u2019 time and this may effect my chances of getting the mortgage. I have separate funds that will cover the stamp duty and upfront costs and so on, so this is not an issue. I\u2019m very lucky to have this deposit but due to my salary I\u2019m not sure home ownership is available to me. LH A Home ownership won\u2019t be an option until you are confirmed as having a permanent position in your new job because even with your sizeable deposit, you wouldn\u2019t be able to get a mortgage. And without a mortgage, you wouldn\u2019t qualify for a help-to-buy equity loan. To qualify for 40% equity loan assistance from London help-to-buy, you have to take out a first mortgage for at least 25% of the value of the property you want to buy. And that mortgage plus your cash deposit must be a minimum of 60% of the purchase price. The mortgage-plus-deposit minimum is 80% for help-to-buy outside London. But as well as waiting until you have a permanent job, there\u2019s no point formally applying for a mortgage until you have been assessed and approved by your local help-to-buy agent (although it would be worth talking to a mortgage adviser to get an idea of the size of mortgage you could afford). The assessment is used to ensure that you are in a position to afford your mortgage and the agent works to a guideline to check that your monthly mortgage costs \u2013 plus service charges and fees \u2013 are no more than 45% of your take-home pay. The mortgage must also not be more than 4.5 times your household income which is good news for you as a \u00a3100,000 mortgage would be only 3.125 times your \u00a332,000 salary. You don\u2019t need to worry about your chances of getting a mortgage being affected by the interest charges on the help-to-buy equity loan because for the first five years the equity loan is interest-free. In year six, the interest on the equity loan \u2013 plus the monthly management fee of \u00a31 which is charged from day one of having the loan \u2013 is paid to Homes England and is separate from your main mortgage. The interest charged in year six is 1.75% of the original equity loan so, in your case \u2013 with an equity loan of \u00a3150,000 - you would pay \u00a32,625 in interest which works out at \u00a3218.75 a month. The interest rate rises by the increase in the Retail Prices Index plus 1%. Want expert help finding your new mortgage?
