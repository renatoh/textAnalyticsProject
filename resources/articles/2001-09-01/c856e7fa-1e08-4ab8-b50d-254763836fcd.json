The 100-strong party executive unanimously accepted a cautious resolution delaying any final decision on nominations to the proposed police board, pending satisfactory resolution of various matters involving both the board and the recently announced policing implementation plan. Although Trimble is known to favour nomination of members to the new board, which Dr Reid wants to be up and running by the end of the month, he has had to compromise with the UUP faction dominated by Jeffrey Donaldson, for the sake of party unity. Donaldson, increasingly seen within hardline sections of the party as heir-apparent to Trimble, favours an informal broad front on policing with Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, in an attempt to claw back what he considers to be fatal concessions to the SDLP and Sinn Fein. The common front tactic was first called for by DUP MP Gregory Campbell. Last week, UUP chairman James Cooper, a Trimble loyalist, moved promptly to denounce Campbell's call for a joint unionist strategy in opposing policing reforms by insisting that DUP motives were selfish. 'Unionist unity, in DUP terms,' he declared, 'means the destruction of the UUP and a return to deeply polarised politics.' 'There has been a lot of nonsense talked about the fact that, by refusing to nominate, we can possibly reverse many of the proposals in the implementation plan. The truth is that, with serious and significant unionist representation on the board, the board itself will be responsible for the speed and the way in which the implementation plan moves forward.' Clearly, Trimble, who was jostled and threatened, along with his wife, by DUP supporters at the Westminster election count earlier in the year, shares that view. As his supporters point out, Ulster Unionist acceptance of any alliance with the Democratic Unionists on the terms envisaged by Donaldson would make Trimble's position politically untenable and personally humiliating. 'It's absolutely not on,' a close colleague said yesterday. The result of the uneasy Ulster Unionist internal compromise, however, is that the SDLP, which has already accepted the police implementation plan, now finds itself isolated in the face of a determined Sinn Fein rejectionist tactic. Thus the policing debate has moved into pole position in the continuing impasse in Ulster politics. The extent to which Reid can manoeuvre to take account of the differing demands on what is supposedly a take-it-or-leave it document remains to be seen. But this week's sessions on policing are only part of the wider debate, running to a deadline of 23 September. On that date, if no agreement is reached by the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein on decommissioning and ministerial power, Reid will again have to face the invidious choice of ordering another suspension of the Assembly or plunging Northern Ireland into yet another election. The Northern Ireland Office view is that a new poll would favour the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein. The reality is that, according to senior republican sources, there is now little prospect of the IRA making any satisfactory response to the Ulster Unionists' demand for a timetabled response on decommissioning weapons within three months, never mind the required three weeks that is laid down in the legislation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
