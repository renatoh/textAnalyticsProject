Half-time elation had given way to that familiar emptiness and the 2-2 draw with Arsenal in the Carling Cup semi-final first leg last January felt like a defeat. Tottenham's exit was confirmed the following week when their rivals outplayed them at the Emirates Stadium en route to a 5-3 aggregate victory, but the events of that high-octane evening at the Lane had far-reaching implications. It was then that the Tottenham board began to see that Martin Jol could not guide them to the level they desired. It was when their worst fears about his inability to outwit the so-called big four crystallised. From that moment Jol's managerial reign began to unravel and, increasingly, it became a question of when rather than if the chairman Daniel Levy would fire the bullet. The shadow of Arsenal has loomed large over a succession of Tottenham managers and Jol's failings in that semi-final first leg triggered angst not only among the rank and file. Juande Ramos was brought in at the end of October to succeed where Jol fell short; tonight's Carling Cup semi-final first leg, at the Emirates, is his biggest test to date. Jol had entered that defining game with a poor record against the big four - only one victory, against Chelsea in the Premier League, in 19 meetings in all competitions. His pre-match rhetoric had been typically stirring. \"Winning is the only thing for my team,\" he said. \"What do we want - to be potential winners?\" Yet his detractors had begun to whisper that his tub-thumping motivational techniques could not compensate for his tactical shortcomings. Those people had more ammunition after the 90 minutes against Arsenal's second string. The tie had started exhilaratingly for Jol and Tottenham. With the crowd at fever pitch and Arsenal rocked back on their heels, they created a host of chances and Dimitar Berbatov provided them with the lead. Although the striker was forced off with a groin strain, Tottenham went 2-0 up on 21 minutes when Julio Baptista put through his own goal. Excitement coursed the stadium at half-time as Tottenham fans sensed a breakthrough win. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had other ideas. The Arsenal manager, unruffled in the eye of the storm, had already seen Cesc F\u00e1bregas begin to exert an influence in central midfield. With two substitutions early in the second half, Wenger wrested the initiative completely. He sent on Aleksandr Hleb for Abou Diaby at left midfield, giving him the licence to roam inside, and he watched the Belarussian produce a command performance. The making of Hleb as an Arsenal player can be traced to that cameo. Wenger then replaced J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re with Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9, asking the Ivorian to occupy the right of midfield and releasing Theo Walcott further forward. Ebou\u00e9 was also outstanding. Jol appeared powerless to prevent wave after wave of Arsenal attacks. The supporters behind him howled. Baptista pulled one back before he punished a Paul Robinson misjudgment to equalise. One of the criticisms levelled at Jol was that he could not alter the course of a match that had slipped from his grasp. That night, he was guilty as charged. Wenger had made him seem a novice. Jol earned a stay of execution with a 4-0 win at Fulham in the FA Cup in mid- February but when a leading club next presented a challenge, he once again faltered. Against Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge, with a 3-1 lead, he erred with his substitutions, taking off Berbatov and then Aaron Lennon to surrender the initiative. Chelsea rallied to 3-3 and they would win the replay. Jol also went down to Sevilla in the Uefa Cup quarter-final, after his side had led in the first leg. When he was dismissed Jol had won only once in his 29 matches against the big four. The Dutchman had claimed upon taking the Tottenham job that \"all the ingredients are in place\" to narrow the gap on Arsenal, and Ramos does not think that the club is too far away despite their continuing defensive vulnerability. \"Arsenal might be the leaders of the Premier League but a couple of weeks ago we showed we are very close to them,\" he said, reflecting upon Tottenham's 2-1 defeat at the Emirates, when Robbie Keane missed a penalty. \"There is tremendous equality between the teams at the moment.\" Ramos was hired for his tactical acumen and has shown flashes of inspiration, with boldness in his substitutions. If he could claim the scalp of Arsenal, it would be a significant step forward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
