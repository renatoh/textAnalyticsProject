When he is having one of his strops it is best to approach him with a minesweeper. After last year's Gold Cup, when Westerner was beaten by Godolphin's Papineau, the French owner growled: \"The dope-testing machine must be broken.\" According to his reputation he is Flat racing's worst loser since . . . well, since his father, Daniel Wildenstein, died in 2001. Yesterday, though, he blinked with something approaching pleasure, and his putty-podgy features almost looked as though they were going to break into a smile; but Monsieur Wildenstein, one senses, only smiles when he wishes to travel incognito. \"My family have waited a long time for this day,\" he said impassively. \"Father used to tell me about the Gold Cup when I was a little boy, and this is one of the races that we have wanted to win most. \"Westerner is a stronger horse than he was when he was beaten by Papineau last year, and the ground was also that bit softer, which helped.\" Wildenstein's unpopularity, however, was evident after the race. When a 7-4 favourite wins the Gold Cup the sky normally turns black with tossed toppers. Yesterday the cheering was mooted, and some booing could even be heard. \"I watched it on TV,\" he said, as if he had just tuned into a soap. \"I was worried when the pace was so slow. But this is six in a row for Westerner. He doesn't need earplugs any more.\" Nor did any of us. Even before his ungracious comments last year Wildenstein had upset racing folk by ignoring a warning that the earplugs worn by Westerner to keep him calm should not be withdrawn during the race, which can boost a horse's performance. The trainer Peter Walwyn described working for the Wildenstein family as the worst mistake of his life, adding: \"Alec was the one who fired the bullets.\" Literally, almost, for he once brandished a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 in front of his wife, Jocelyne, who had such an obsession for plastic surgery she was dubbed \"The Bride of Wildenstein\" by American tabloids. They are now divorced. Pat Eddery was once dismissed as a \"mere boy\" and when Walwyn stayed loyal to the jockey, Wildenstein withdrew his horses. Lester Piggott wrote in his autobiography: \"The Wildenstein family are inveterate bad losers.\" Last year Wilden stein described his jockey, Dominique Boeuf, as an \"asshole\" and sacked him. All of which explains why not everyone was cheering yesterday. \"Isn't it great news that that nice Mr Wildenstein has won at last,\" said someone with bitter sarcasm. Others passed the time during the reception by pawing through their cards and discussing their favourites for the next race. \"Great horse, that Westerner,\" said one. \"Pity about the owner.\" They can move Ascot to York but they cannot erase the memories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
