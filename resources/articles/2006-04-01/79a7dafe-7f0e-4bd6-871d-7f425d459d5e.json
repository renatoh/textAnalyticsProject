First there was her tabloid-alleged affair with David Beckham; then there was her televised flirtation with a pig and a pair of rubber gloves. But these days she has a more legitimate excuse - testing heart-rate monitors as part of her training for the London Marathon later this month. 'I had a pedometer, but that was no good. Heart-rate monitors, however, are much more reliable and useful. They need to invent an iPod with these features - and I'm sure they will, one day,' says Loos. 'I'm confident about the marathon. I go to the gym once or twice a week, but mainly it's running. I go past Buckingham Palace - often popping in for a cup of tea with the Queen,' she jokes. 'If I did it in three hours 45 minutes, I'd be happy. Then I could sit back, have a glass of champagne, and wait for my trainer to catch up.' Loos is taking TV-presenting lessons at drama school. 'I want to do more challenging stuff - I've set up a production company and we're going to do some documentaries.' She also has a passion for motorbikes and has just passed her test on a 1450cc Harley-Davidson - which would certainly make easier work of the 26.2-mile marathon course. Loos reviewed the five products with her personal trainer, Luis Vera, at the Club Kensington gym in west London. On Sunday 23 April, she will be tackling the marathon course in aid of the Red Cross (0870 170 7000, www.redcross.org.uk). 1. Polar RS200SD - John Lewis, \u00a3154.50 They say ... Perfect for anyone training for the London Marathon, this measures speed and distance as well as heart rate. Other features include a measure of calories burnt and total exercise done, a week-view memory file and 'crosstalk' prevention to avoid unwanted interference. ... And Rebecca says This is really cool, especially as it measures your speed and distance. Overall, this is expensive, but worth it, though the fact that the footpad batteries only last 20 hours is a pain. 2. Polar RS100 - John Lewis, \u00a369.50 They say ... Has all the primary features for an effective body workout. There's a warm-up routine and an 'OwnZone' feature that automatically recommends a heart-rate zone appropriate to your goals and physical condition. An alarm sounds if you move out of this zone. Water-resistant to 30 metres. ... And Rebecca says The best one for basic running training, with a clear display and all of the features you need. The 'hands-free' button, activated by moving the watch to the chest strap, changes the display. 3. York P30 - Argos, \u00a359.99 They say ... Flagship of the York range, this has a personalised calorie counter which - using a formula based on your age, weight, exercise intensity and fitness level - provides more accurate data than some other calorie counters. Other features include a heart-rate recovery timer and target-zone alarm. ... And Rebecca says The strap doesn't seem as comfortable as the others, and the display is quite difficult to read, though there is a backlight. This model is similar to Reebok's, but has a few more functions. 4. Reebok slimline 10 HRM - Argos, \u00a349.99 They say ... Reebok's ECG-accurate monitor has a high and low target zone, scan showing maximum, average and minimum heart rate, and includes a lightweight transmitter belt. Watch functions include a 10-hour stopwatch, calendar and daily alarm option. ... And Rebecca says Irritating and overpriced; I wouldn't wear this. The screen is very hard to read and it has awkward little buttons. Reebok doesn't specialise in heart-rate monitors - and it shows. 5. Oregon HR102 -JOHN LEWIS, \u00a324.95 They say ... This 'value for money' product is recommended to beginners. It keeps you within your personal ideal heart rate zone, with an alarm that sounds when you are outside this. The wireless chest strap gives an ECG-accurate reading. It also features a backlight, alarm, stopwatch, carrying case and bicycle mount. It is water resistant to 30 metres. ... And Rebecca says Great for someone just getting started with exercise. It's straightforward, has a very clear screen and is good value for money. The only monitor on test with a handlebar mount for the wristwatch included in the price. Top tips from John Lewis The best monitors use a wireless chest strap to transmit heart-rate information continuously to a wristwatch. Strapless monitors with finger sensors are also available; these give accurate, but not constant, readings. Pulse-monitoring watches tend to be unreliable. What kind of exercise are you into? Most heart-rate monitors are fine for running, but are not necessarily suited to rowing exercise (the strap may come off) or to swimming (the device may not be waterproof). Most heart-rate monitors are accurate, but only when the chest strap makes good contact with the skin. Ensure that the strap is suitable for you, and moisten the pads to improve the connection. Some monitors can 'cross-talk' with others in the same room. If you plan to exercise in a busy gym, consider a device that blocks signals from other chest straps. Do you want to store your fitness information? Some monitors are compatible with computers and mobile phones, allowing you to keep a training diary and analyse your progress. Some waterproof monitors have to be returned to the manufacturer for the batteries to be replaced. If you would find this a pain, buy a model which has 'self-changeable' batteries. Pedometers are so out of fashion - and can be inaccurate. But heart-rate monitors with running speed and distance functions are 96-97 per cent accurate. Women who find the products too bulky should consider a slimline wrist monitor.
