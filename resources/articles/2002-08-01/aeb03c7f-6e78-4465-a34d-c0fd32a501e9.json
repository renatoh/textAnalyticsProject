There isn't a trick to getting a bargain on baby food other than, perhaps, bulk-buying a pallet of it from a supermarket or cash-and-carry. Examine the list of ingredients on the label carefully. It is well known that baby food should not contain salt or large amounts of added sugar, but other additives should be avoided too. The order of ingredients is important, as they should be listed according to percentage by volume, highest to lowest. Watch out for large amounts of starch, water, gluten and thickeners, all of which can be used to bulk out the advertised principal ingredient. Organic baby food has seen an explosion in sales over the past decade, though there are strict controls on the use of ingredients grown with pesticides in all baby foods. Hipp, the most popular brand accounts for about 60% of organic baby-food sales, but dozens of other brands exist.
