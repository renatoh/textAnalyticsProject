On an ordinary pitch, with average bowling and poor batting, the quality has been lacking and at one stage the contest seemed likely to be over in two days. There have been consolations: Vikram Solanki's stylish obduracy, Liam Dawson's continued development and the hoary belligerence of Dominic Cork, who added one wicket yesterday to the four he collected in the first innings. Dawson, 19, has been voted Hampshire's most promising young player for the past two seasons. A strong right-handed batsmen who bowls slow left-arm, he could push Samit Patel for his ODI place if the Nottinghamshire man makes a hash of his calorie count. The game was in the balance when play resumed, with Hampshire 76-4 in reply to Worcestershire's 132. They slid to 116-7 before Dawson (66) and Cork (25) added 91 for the eighth wicket, although both players were dropped. Hampshire's lead of 84 looked decisive but Worcestershire's batting was so awful that at one stage they looked likely to be beaten by an innings. Graeme Hick's retirement has left a hole so big it is as if the club has been hit by a comet. When Worcestershire slumped to 53-7, they looked in danger of surpassing their previous lowest against Hampshire \u2013 68 at Dudley in 1961 when Derek Shackleton and Butch White took four wickets each on the way to their side's first championship title. Moeen Ali turned one straight to square-leg, Steve Davies pushed lamely to second slip and Gareth Batty played a stroke of such ugliness it should have had a brown paper bag placed over it. Solanki part saved the day, with some handsome strokes in his unbeaten 64 as he and Chris Whelan almost trebled the score. Whelan was out in the last over of the day and Worcestershire led by 66."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
