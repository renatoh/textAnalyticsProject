First, how you respond to the line \"We're talking about the quantum entanglement of cause and effect. Imagine the unspeakable beauty of the universe he sees!\" And second, how well you bear the searing disappointment of seeing Kiefer Sutherland do Concerned Dad acting as Martin Bohm, the father of autistic (OR IS HE?) son Jake, instead of being Alpha Male of his Generation, Universe and Galaxy Jack Bauer in 24. First things first. The \"quantum entanglement\" line is delivered by Professor Arthur DeWitt explaining that Jake is not autistic (YOU SEE!) but a supremely gifted individual who is obsessed with certain numbers and patterns because he can see the interconnectedness of all things. He represents, in fact, the next step in human evolution. Rather like the protagonists in Kring's last major TV drama series, of course, but hell, if a furrow's worth ploughing it's worth ploughing until the (audience) share falls off, I say. But whaddya know? The prof is right. The sprawling cast of characters to whom we are rapidly introduced, from terrorists in Baghdad to the fireman who could not save Jake's mother on 9/11, are all linked by the numbers (in tattoos and mobile phones, on lottery tickets and licence plates) revered by Jake. And, at the end of the extended opening episode, atop a cell tower in the pouring rain, Jake finally hugged his father. At which point you will need to consult your response to point two and either give yourself over entirely to this as yet no more than serviceable hokum or start scouring the globe in a desperate search for Jack Bauer's balls. Horizon: The Truth About Fat (BBC2) was presented by the surgeon and writer Gabriel Weston with the cool precision you would hope for from a woman in her line of work. It looked at the possible causes, beyond abundance of food plus bodies designed to store for scarcity equalling pork-o-rama, of the obesity crisis that is driving Weston, and just about every other NHS doctor, demented (I paraphrase, but not much), asking why, given that we all share the same biology and environment, there are still thinnifers among the fattypuffs. Two recently discovered hormones which control our feelings of hunger and fullness seem to be the main culprits. In some of us they work better than in others. That's just the luck of the draw. As is the other bugger, your genetic inheritance. Oh, and your mother's diet during pregnancy. It was all very interesting but \u2013 the flaw common to all medical programmes, which seem more terrified than most of overestimating the audience's intelligence \u2013 only as far as it went. We were still subjected to pointless padding \u2013 if I hear another set of twins in a genetics study giving me the details of their similarities and differences that in isolation mean nothing, I will cleave a director in twain and send him off to a medical research centre. And you don't need to show me a pig's carcass being hacked up to get at the visceral fat. Just tell me we have it too, I'll believe you and we can use the four minutes saved to examine something else, like whether any of the new causes of obesity mean that willpower is useless or, in order to counter known predispositions, more important than ever. Some answer to that, surely, should have been the conclusion instead of the reiteration of current advice \u2013 exercise, less poking of cake down throats \u2013 with which it closed. Rita Simons: My Daughter, Deafness and Me (BBC1), which followed EastEnders actor Simons as she considered whether or not to teach her daughter to sign and/or let her have a cochlear implant, also stopped just where it should have started. She came into conflict with members of the deaf community who thought she was denying her child access to her true culture but this fascinating \u2013 and rarely widely discussed \u2013 area was quickly abandoned. It did a disservice to the deaf community, who need time to explain their case if they are not to look to a predominantly hearing audience absurdly militant, and to Simons, who was a brilliant, fearless and articulate presenter-subject. When are we going to be able to use our red buttons to vote for the points we'd like a follow-up programme on, please, television multimedia, interactive nonsense/magic people, please?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
