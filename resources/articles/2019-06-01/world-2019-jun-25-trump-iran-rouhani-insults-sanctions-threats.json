The very personal exchange was reminiscent of similar verbal clashes between the US and North Korean leaders in late 2017, and underlined the volatility of US foreign policymaking in the present standoff in the Gulf. Trump has swung between dire threats and offers of talks without preconditions, while ramping up sanctions. The worsening confrontation became significantly more personal this week when the US imposed sanctions on Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and eight military commanders, and threatened measures against the foreign minister, Javad Zarif. On Tuesday, Rouhani responded by describing the US president as \u201cafflicted by a mental disorder\u201d and said the sanctions against Khamenei were \u201coutrageous and idiotic\u201d \u2013 especially as the 80-year-old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the US. The insult was an echo of Kim Jong-un\u2019s broadside against the US president in September 2017, when he called Trump a \u201cmentally deranged US dotard\u201d. The slanging match between Trump and Kim ultimately gave way to summitry and claims of mutual affection (with Trump even claiming they \u201cfell in love\u201d). The path to a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran, however, looks far more complicated. As it has frequently in the past, the reference to Trump\u2019s mental faculties triggered an emotional response, and a flurry of tweets. \u201cIran leadership doesn\u2019t understand the words \u2018nice\u2019 or \u2018compassion,\u2019 they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe U.S. has not forgotten Iran\u2019s use of IED\u2019s &amp; EFP\u2019s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more \u2026 Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.\u201d Trump\u2019s estimate of US fatalities is much higher than the Pentagon estimate of 600. Iran has been adamant it will not be pressured into concessions and will not negotiate with the US under the current oil, banking and trade embargo. The Trump administration has accompanied the buildup of economic pressure with offers to talk. In recent days, Trump has said that offer is without preconditions. However, there have been mixed messages over what any talks would be about. State department officials have insisted a wide-ranging list of 12 US demands, including withdrawal from Syria and cutting support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, would have to be met for sanctions to be lifted. Trump has repeatedly suggested that his sole concern is that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. Zarif on Tuesday restated Iran\u2019s insistence that it would never pursue a nuclear weapon, saying Islam prevented the country from doing so. Iran has previously said it is ideologically and religiously opposed to acquiring nuclear weapons and seeks nuclear power only for civilian purposes. But in the current unpredictable climate it is possible Trump could pick up Zarif\u2019s remarks as a signal to talk. Tehran has warned that on Thursday it will breach the limits on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set out in the 2015 nuclear deal. Without sanctions relief, it will take a further \u2013 potentially more significant \u2013 step on 8 July of raising the level at which it enriches uranium, above the 3.67% agreed in 2015. With those potential flashpoints looming, France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Rouhani by telephone on Tuesday. Macron and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, are expected to try to defuse tensions when they see Trump at the G20 summit in Osaka on Friday. Tehran said the US had spent weeks demanding that Iran match America\u2019s diplomacy, but was now trying to immobilise its chief diplomat, by sanctioning Zarif. \u201cImposing useless sanctions on Iran\u2019s supreme leader and the commander of Iran\u2019s diplomacy is the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,\u201d the foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said in a tweet on Tuesday. \u201cTrump\u2019s desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security.\u201d Speaking in Israel, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and \u201call that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door\u201d. Iran\u2019s decision to breach the nuclear deal places the EU in a dilemma: France, Germany and the UK are desperate to keep the deal alive but cannot find a route to de-escalate the crisis between Tehran and Washington. The three European countries issued a statement on the margins of the UN security council on Monday urging Iran to stay inside the deal. They also insisted they were working hard to implement their commitments to Iran \u2013 a reference to setting up financial mechanisms to help Tehran trade with Europe without the threat of US sanctions \u2013 and condemned recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned Iran not to breach the uranium enrichment limits, saying in the Commons: \u201cIt is absolutely essential they stick to that deal in its entirety for it to preserve and for us to have a nuclear-free Middle East.\u201d He also ruled out British involvement in military action. \u201cThe US is our closest ally. We talk to them the whole time but I cannot envisage any situation where they request, or we agree to, any moves to go to war.\u201d Analysts said the impact of the fresh US sanctions on an already heavily sanctioned country would be limited. \u201cThe newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,\u201d said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries comes in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denied responsibility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
