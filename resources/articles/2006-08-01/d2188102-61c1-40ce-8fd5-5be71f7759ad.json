It's based on its screenwriter Oscar Torres's childhood experiences of growing up in a mountain village in El Salvador during the ferocious civil war of 1980 to 1992 when 12-year-old boys were routinely forced by the national army to fight against the guerrillas. The period is vividly recreated and the point of view of a lad approaching that dangerous 12th birthday well sustained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
