Amid euphoric scenes in America on Sunday, Langer intimated that he would be interested in leading Europe, again, in 2006. However, his mindset would appear to have changed during the flight back to London, where Europe's triumphant team received a rapturous reception last night. \"I still think I'm going to stick to what I said,\" said Langer. \"I'm only going to do it once because I just think it's not right and fair to the many other guys who are waiting in line that deserve to do this too. \"I had my chance at it, I did it as well as I could and I enjoyed my time with these guys,\" he said. The laughter from the 10 players sat alongside Langer - Padraig Harrington and Luke Donald were absent - suggested they shared the German's sentiments. The German's likely decision to step down could pave the way for Colin Montgomerie to take on the role of captain in Ireland in two years' time, though Langer believes Europe's talisman should prolong his playing career. \"Monty's too young next time.\" It is a view that the 41-year-old Scot, who has endured a dramatic year following the break-up of his marriage, would appear to support. \"If I can perform the way I did this time I think I can help the team in some way,\" said Montgomerie. \"I would like to be part of it but that's a decision for me and whoever has to pick me next time.\" Langer also paid tribute to his players for the emphatic nature of their victory, which saw Europe overwhelm America on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. \"We couldn't dream of a better outcome than what happened because we beat them every single day,\" he said. \"They really couldn't match us and that just shows how strong this team is. We just had the most awesome week you could imagine.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
