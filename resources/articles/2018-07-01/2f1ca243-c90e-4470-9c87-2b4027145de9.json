Rush announced on Monday night that he would no longer participate in the company\u2019s production of Twelfth Night, which is due to begin in four months. On Monday, Rush said he was withdrawing from the role with \u201cthe greatest regret\u201d. \u201cDue to my current circumstances and medical advice, I must withdraw from the upcoming project of Twelfth Night,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that I would not be able to provide the necessary creative spirit and the professional stamina required for the project. \u201cI am certain that Simon Phillips, the director, will deliver an outstanding production and I wish all involved the very best in its success.\u201d The Oscar-winning actor is suing the Daily Telegraph for defamation over a series of articles published late last year which aired allegations the actor was involved in \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d during a Sydney Theatre Company production of King Lear three years ago. Rush has vehemently denied the allegations and the court has previously heard Rush\u2019s lawyers argue that he had suffered \u201ctremendous emotional and social hardship\u201d as a result of the articles and that he barely eats and is virtually housebound. The cast of Twelfth Night also includes Christie Whelan Browne, who has accused Craig McLachlan of sexual harassment. McLachlan is suing Whelan Browne, Fairfax and the ABC over reports that McLachlan allegedly bullied and indecently assaulted Whelan Browne and other cast members when they worked on The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan has also strenuously denied the allegations made against him. Melbourne Theatre Company artistic director, Brett Sheehy, said the company \u201crespects Geoffrey\u2019s decision\u201d. \u201cOut of respect for Geoffrey\u2019s privacy we will be making no further comment on this matter,\u201d he said. \u201cCasting announcements will be made in due course.\u2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
