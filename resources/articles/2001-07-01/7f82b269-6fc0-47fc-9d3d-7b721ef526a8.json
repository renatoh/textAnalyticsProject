The furry stars of ITV's Rainbow came under the hammer at the auctioneer's TV Generation sale, held at its Kensington salesroom, and fetched a whopping \u00a37,990 Christie's had anticipated a value of \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000 for Lot 108, which includes the original costumes for all three and a number of outfits from the show. But the final price is a bargain compared to the prices some toys have fetched in the past. Hornby models have fetched sums in the low thousands, while a well-preserved Marklin-produced train could raise between \u00a310,000 and \u00a330,000. The world record price for a single toy was recorded in America in 1991 when Christie's received a bid for \u00a3231,000 (\u00a3165,013) for a tin toy dating from about 1875. Why a lonely childhood could net you a fortune If all this has inspired you to check out the old toy chest in the loft, what should you be looking out for? According to Hugo Marsh, head of Christie's toy department, things that are still in their boxes are a good place to start. \"One of the most important factors in the value of a toy is a miserable childhood. We see a lot of people who were only allowed to look at their toys or only allowed to play with them on Sunday,\" he says. This has resulted in toys from the 1950s and 60s turning up in almost mint condition. \"These people have had a repressed childhood - and a wealthy adulthood as a result,\" he says. Any well-preserved plaything is likely to capture a collector's attention, but if you're going to make big money you need to unearth something that's in demand. \"The hardy perennials are toys inspired by the Thunderbirds and James Bond,\" says Marsh. \"Anything connected with the original hey-day in the 1960s. These films were well-merchandised in the first place and there were lots of good quality toys.\" Dinky toy replicas of the Thunderbirds go for anything from \u00a3125 without their boxes, while well-maintained versions can fetch hundreds more. Entertainment specialists Fleetwood Owen will auction the original puppets from the series of the Thunderbirds on July 31, so look out for more record prices. Will your collection of the Teletubbies make you rich? Not everyone is lucky enough to have an antique Lady Penelope in their loft, but there could be other hidden treasures. As a general rule of thumb, Marsh says a collector's item is unlikely to be less than 30 years of age. \"The European toy industry was at its peak before 1970,\" he says. \"The quantity and quality was better. Things are marketed much more cynically now - a film can make a lot from toys and merchandising which means there are more preserved.\" In contrast, he says, there were smaller production runs and a high degree of natural wastage prior to 1970, reducing the supply and increasing the current prices. With this in mind, Marsh is reluctant to predict the antiques of the future. More people are keeping toys in boxes with the hope of protecting their value, he says, a trend which is reducing potential demand. \"The value of current toys is unlikely to increase,\" he says, \"but the wild-card factor is nostalgia.\" Who can say what we'll miss in 20 years' time? Perhaps we'll look back on Teletubbies with the same misty eyes as we now look at Bungle and the gang. The answer, as with all collectors' items, is to buy what you like. That way, if your box-fresh Tinky Winky doesn't fetch enough for you to retire on, you can always rip off the packaging and relive your youth. Most of the big auction houses offer free valuations, so if you think you've unearthed a treasure, pop to your nearest showroom for an expert opinion.
