The program, Optimising Health and Learning, is a partnership between schools and health services which screens children who have recently arrived to Australia for health issues that may hamper their education. The president of the program, Rob Lindsay, said he helped to establish the pilot program in 2011 when he was deputy principal of Menai high school using seed funding of $25,000 from the National Australia Bank\u2019s school grants program. \u201cIt was so successful that in 2013 the project won the NSW premier\u2019s public sector award and the NSW health innovations award,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cDespite all this, government funding to secure the sustainability of the project has not been forthcoming and our funding will run out in June. \u201cWithout the project, between 1,000 and 1,200 refugee and vulnerable migrant children will be exited into mainstream high schools each year with an inhibited capacity to learn, because illnesses affecting their learning will not have been detected.\u201d As part of the program, registered nurses conduct health checks on children attending intensive English language centresin preparation for high school. About 90% of refugee children and 75% of the migrant children screened through the program had at least one condition that needed treatment, Lindsay said. \u201cThere\u2019s an urban myth out there that health screening of refugee and migrant children is done before or when they get to Australia, but to get a full, comprehensive health screening you have to be over 18,\u201d Lindsay said. On arrival in Australia students and their families faced language or education barriers to accessing health care, which meant vision and hearing problems, diseases, and iron and vitamin deficiencies went undetected, he said. The NSW health minister, Jillian Skinner, told Guardian Australia the government recognised the importance of programs for newly arrived refugees and asylum seekers, but stopped short of saying the Optimising Heath and Learning program would be funded. \u201cThe NSW ministry of health is continuing to work ... to determine how the Optimising Health and Learning Program can complement the refugee health service in relation to child refugees and asylum seekers,\u201d she said. Some health screening services are publicly available, but the engagement rate of refugees and vulnerable migrants was only 18%, compared with 100% of children targeted through the program, Lindsay said. He said after they received treatment, the learning ability and confidence of the students improved drastically. \u201cA couple of years ago I had some teachers come up to me to say one of their 15-year-old students wasn\u2019t learning, but it turned out he had vision problems and couldn\u2019t see what they were teaching,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cWe organised some glasses for him and he came up to me one day and told me he had been able to watch a movie for the first time. \u201cAnother child\u2019s teacher said he was out partying all night because he kept falling asleep in class. One day, I saw the child doubled over in pain. It turned out he had an undiagnosed spinal disease that kept him up all night in pain, and he couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d A cost analysis of the program conducted by the Centre for Health Economics in 2013 found about 7% of students screened had a hearing impairment significant enough to require a specialist, despite only 4% reporting any problems with their hearing. The report found many children were unaware they were unwell. Migrant students were significantly less likely than refugee students to have visited a GP since their arrival to Australia, the report found. Professor David Isaacs, who runs the refugee clinic at the Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead, said about 50% of children he saw in the clinic were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cThat can be stress related to what they witnessed or endured in their homeland, it can relate to a traumatic journey to Australia on a boat, it can relate to uncertainty about what their families face in future,\u201d Isaacs said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t deal with health problems related to stress, then it can have a lifelong effect on children and will impair their ability to learn, to relate to others and to contribute to society.\u201d He said the Optimising Heath and Learning program should \u201cabsolutely\u201d receive secure state government funding. \u201cIf we just assume everyone is all right once they arrive here then we are in for a rude shock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have traumatised people with unaddressed health problems, which is bad for them, and bad for society.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
