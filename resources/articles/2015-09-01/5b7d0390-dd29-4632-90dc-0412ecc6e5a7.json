Newcastle United\u2019s manager is candid when it comes to acknowledging that he does not know his best team or system yet. It is almost certainly not 4-1-4-1 \u2013 the formation experimented with against an impressive Watford \u2013 and particularly not with Jack Colback deployed in the midfield anchoring role that patently does not suit him. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have an identity yet,\u201d said McClaren, whose struggling side have scored only three Premier League goals and taken only two points. \u201cWe are still searching for our best team. We\u2019re also searching for the best identity within the personnel we\u2019ve got. We have to find a way of playing.\u201d At Middlesbrough he initially tried to play attacking, flowing football but the first four games were lost and he switched immediately to a much more defensive approach designed to grind out wins. Is history about to repeat itself? \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to look at,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cCan we be free flowing? Can we be this or that? It\u2019s about results. We have to be pragmatic.\u201d The problem is that tactics are only as good as the players deployed to carry them out and, despite spending \u00a350m this summer, Newcastle\u2019s squad remains imbalanced. Unless the injured Cheik Tiot\u00e9 can suddenly recapture his long-lost form when he returns, the squad lacks an all-important midfield enforcer. Deep down, McClaren must have suspected Colback was not quite right for the role but, bar taking the radical step of assigning it to Fabricio Coloccini, showing his age at centre-half, there was no real alternative. After three months in charge the depth of such structural squad flaws is fully dawning on the former England coach, even if he continues to believe that he has the nucleus of a good team. \u201cWe came into a new experience and thought: \u2018Phwoar, let\u2019s go\u2019 and then, suddenly it\u2019s: \u2018Woah, what\u2019s happening there?\u2019\u201d conceded McClaren. \u201cWe have to turn it round. But I still say this is a good squad, with good players. Not winning adds to the tension and pressure and fuels the criticism we\u2019re going to receive but to win, you need belief.\u201d Newcastle had none in a first half during which they simply surrendered to their newly promoted visitors. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores cleverly switched his formation to 4-4-2, ensuring that the excellent Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney bullied Coloccini and company throughout while persistently pulling their opponents out of shape. By half-time Ighalo had scored twice, taking his 2015 league tally to 20 in 24 games, and he could easily have had a couple more. A second-half improvement resulted in Daryl Janmaat \u2013 Newcastle\u2019s best player and, although a right-back, their biggest attacking threat \u2013 reducing the deficit but an equaliser would not quite come. \u201cWe knew they were under pressure,\u201d said Ighalo. \u201cWe knew not to be afraid. We pushed and pushed and there was a lot of space for us to do damage.\u201d Considering Flores arrived in Hertfordshire in June he deserves enormous credit for not only blending assorted new signings into a real team but being willing to compromise his purist inclinations and allowing Watford to indulge in a sometimes direct approach that makes the very most of their speed and athleticism \u2013 not to mention Ighalo and Deeney. With Papiss Ciss\u00e9 painfully out of sorts, McClaren would probably give an awful lot for an Ighalo. Not that he is entirely downcast. \u201cThere\u2019s enough in our dressing room,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough attitude and spirit not to panic and to stay calm. There\u2019s no crisis. We can turn it round.\u201d His ultimate solution promises to be intriguing. Man of the match Odion Ighalo (Watford)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
