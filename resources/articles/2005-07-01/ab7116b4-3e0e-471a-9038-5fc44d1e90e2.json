Chief executive Stuart Rose, however, insisted his recovery plan remained on track and the chain's chairman, Paul Myners, said he remained convinced that M&amp;S was right to rebuff Mr Green. \"Nothing that has happened since has caused us to think we made the wrong choice\", he told shareholders attending the retailer's annual meeting in Birmingham yesterday. But shareholders attacked payoffs handed to departing directors, the signing on fees paid to the new executive team and the credentials of Lord Burns, who has been hired to takeover from Mr Myners next year. The meeting, attended by only around 400 investors - compared with 3,000 last year at the height of the bid frenzy - was told of a fresh downturn in sales during the fourteen weeks to July 9. Like-for-like sales in the quarter were down 5.4%, with general merchandise - clothing, footwear and homewares - down a worse-than-expected 11.2%. It was the seventh consecutive quarter of falling sales for the UK's biggest clothing retailer. However, there was upturn in like-for-like food sales. The 0.7% improvement was the first positive figure for 18 months. Mr Rose admitted that \"at first reading they (the sales figures) look pretty poor\", but urged investors to focus on the improvements achieved and insisted his recovery plan is still on schedule. \"We are exactly on track to where I thought it would be. Last year the business was overstocked. Last year's sales were artificially inflated by markdowns\". This year, he said, M&amp;S is going into its summer sale with 40% less stock, and the sale - which gets under way today -is starting 18 days later than last year. He said the full price sales were down 2.4% - but that was an improving trend over the last nine months. His turnaround plan for this year, he reiterated, was \"never predicated on top line growth, but on better quality sales\". The retailer's shares climbed as the City was encouraged by Mr Rose's upbeat assessment of prospects, closing up 7.75p at 365.75p - still well below the 400p proposal from Philip Green. Mr Rose has been under increasing pressure to reach that 400p share level but has so far failed. Mr Green yesterday again insisted he had been right not to offer more.\"You can buy anything if you want to pay the wrong price,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme. \"I think some of the best deals in life are the ones you don't do. It wasn't the right price. And as time has proven the market and the economy have got much more difficult. My fears of us getting into trouble paying the wrong price have been well founded.\" Marks and Spencer's market share is still declining. At the end of May its share of the key womenswear market was 10.2%, down from 10.9% a year ago. The chief executive, however, said he believed the rate of decline was slowing and the chain's share of the food market has stabilised. Mr Rose added:. \"I wouldn't want to call the turn\", he said. \"We are still in the middle of a transition\". He told shareholders he had his \"fingers crossed\" for the rest of this year: \"Clearly the next two quarters are very important to us\". But he warned: \"The next six to nine months will be difficult\". Mr Myners, also chairman of Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian, was forced to defend the golden handshakes and options payouts totalling \u00a317m given to six departing directors axed after Mr Rose was installed to see off Mr Green's bid. Small shareholder Anthony Lynham criticised Mr Rose's \u00a31.25m signing-on fee and the \u00a3699,000 handed to former retail director Mark McKeon, who was axed after just nine months on the board. \"Are we signing football players?\" asked Mr Lynham. \"What did that man do in nine months for \u00a3700,000?\" Mr Myners said he found rewards for failure \"unpalatable\" and that the payments had \"stuck in his throat\". The chairman said the former management were like Marks &amp; Spencers'clothes last year: \"We had the wrong stock. We had to replace it\". Another shareholder questioned why M&amp;S was installing Lord Burns as its new chairman. \"There seems to be almost no upside from the shareholders point of view\", said Gavin Palmer, a board member of the UK shareholders' association. He queried why Lord Burns was to be paid twice Mr Myners' \u00a3200,000 salary: \"Is he twice as good?\" Mr Myners insisted he was \"a good man\". \u00b7Sainsbury's chairman Philip Hampton yesterday promised shareholders it would boost its dividend again, but could not say when, writes Cosima Marriner. Sainsbury's halved the divi from 15.69p a share to 7.8p this year after its profit fell 98%. Mr Hampton told shareholders at the annual meeting it was not an easy decision to cut the dividend, but it was \"absolutely the right one\". \"Once we're satisfied profitability is being restored in a sustainable way, we'll increase the divi,\" he said. Although Sainsbury's turnover rose 5% from \u00a315.5bn to \u00a316.4bn in the year to March, profits dropped from \u00a3610m to \u00a315m. Mr Hampton said the company had been \"drifting down\" in terms of sales and market share. In a move to kickstart sales and profit growth, shareholders approved a share plan for 1,000 Sainsbury's staff including chief executive Justin King and store managers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
