Initially she laughed it off. It wasn\u2019t an auspicious occasion: there was no ring and the pair were watching the Bathurst car race on TV. Danielle remembers saying: \u201c\u2018Ask me again if you\u2019re serious one day and I\u2019ll probably answer.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, I am serious.\u2019 I went, \u2018Oh. OK. Well, yes why not.\u2019\u201d Now, 28 years later, she laughs at the memory. \u201cIf we analyse it now, we think \u2018What the hell?\u2019 Like, it\u2019s crazy. If our daughter, who is 26, came home and said \u2018I\u2019m marrying someone I met four weeks ago\u2019, we would probably have said, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d But she also sensed he was the man for her from the start: \u201cWe were like best friends straight away. Just an amazing connection, so we never, well for me personally, I never ever questioned it. We just did it.\u201d The couple met in 1990 on a night out in Adelaide when she was 21 and he was 24. Initially one of her friends tried to chat Anthony up. \u201c[My friend] came back later and she said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, you need to meet this guy, he\u2019s just not interested in me at all, he\u2019s just staring at you\u2019,\u201d Danielle remembers. The two got chatting but it wasn\u2019t the usual pub banter. They covered religion, family \u2013 and education. They were both teachers, interested in the wellbeing and mental health of children. \u201cIt was really interesting to have [that] connection with someone rather than just trivial stuff,\u201d Anthony says. They spent the next three weekends together and then they were engaged. They were married a year later. They come from different family backgrounds and, although they shared an interest in education, most of their other interests were quite separate \u2013 and that was a good thing. \u201cWe worked that out pretty quickly that we could be quite different and have very different upbringings, but actually our values were very similar,\u201d Danielle says. Anthony says they understood that each needed to accomplish their own goals, with the support of the other. Daniele adds: \u201cWe were two separate people within a relationship, we didn\u2019t need to be the same and we didn\u2019t need to have the same views on everything.\u201d Money for instance can be \u201ca sore point\u201d. They have different approaches to money, which they put down to different upbringings: Anthony is more conservative, Danielle is less so. They know it\u2019s a sticking point for them although they\u2019re getting better at recognising situations that could cause conflict. \u201cThe more aware we are of each other\u2019s triggers with it, we can work around how to have a discussion around it and being sensitive to how the other person might respond to that,\u201d Danielle says. It comes down to trust, Anthony says. Whenever he\u2019s concerned about money, he\u2019s learnt to trust his wife. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ve complemented each other too, that sometimes I\u2019m a little bit more cautious, and Elle is more prepared to take risks.\u201d Initially they also had different approaches to raising children. This was put to the test when Danielle suffered from postnatal depression after the birth of their first child. \u201cI just remember that first six months being a real blur, but Anthony stepped up and seemed to handle everything,\u201d she says. Once she recovered, they talked deeply about parenting. \u201cWe talked about the type of people we wanted to raise, and what our hopes and dreams were for them. As much as we were busy, and we definitely got on autopilot for a lot of those years, we always continued to have those deep conversations and challenge each other when we felt like we were just parenting from our parents, like our past, our parental history, and not being conscious about what we should be doing right now for our kids.\u201d When it came to family responsibilities, they didn\u2019t rely on traditional roles. \u201cIt was just whoever was there had to get in and help out,\u201d Anthony says. They were both working full-time, so whether it was cooking, cleaning or painting the house, one of them stepped in. \u201cIt was defined by what was good for each other, and the kids at the time.\u201d The fact they had similar \u2013 and very demanding \u2013 jobs helped: both were teaching or working as school principals. \u201c[Teaching] is a very giving job and you can be really drained by the end of the day, or on the weekend, there\u2019s nothing left emotionally,\u201d Danielle says. \u201cWe had that empathy for each other, that you could come home completely shattered, and the other one would step up in those times and help out a bit more.\u201d There were challenges to being in the same profession. Each time they worked at the same school, they swore never again. \u201cWhen you work at the same school, you tend to come home and it\u2019s really hard to let it go. You continue those conversations about this and that after school. We had to really set some boundaries at times and say right, that\u2019s it. We can come home and debrief until six o\u2019clock and then we really need to switch off and try and have more family time.\u201d However, they had to rethink their lives a few years ago when Anthony had what he initially thought was a heart attack. He was a principal of a Catholic school in a small town, living hours away from his family and under enormous stress. It was a frightening moment for the couple, and although it turned out to be an acute anxiety attack, they knew they had to take a break. They\u2019d spent time in Bali and so they decided to get away from it all. But while they were away, Anthony had a horrifying recollection. During the meditational practice, memories of being abused as a small child came flooding back to him. He chokes up as he tells the story, his pain still evident today. \u201cIt was a massive shock to realise the abuse had happened, because it was a Catholic priest. We were a very religious family, and we didn\u2019t think anything like that could happen,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt really strange that I couldn\u2019t believe that my subconscious had kept that suppressed so much.\u201d He pauses to clear his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s been times that I\u2019ve been in the absolute depths of despair [and] Elle has been there, and it\u2019s given me the courage to get up and go again, because ultimately I had to do something about it myself \u2026 The love from Elle and the kids has helped that a lot. You really lose a lot of your identity, I\u2019ve associated my identity for 48 years as being a Catholic, and to be able to come to that and still have the relationship that we have has been pretty eye opening.\u201d After that initial recollection, more memories resurfaced, and the family pulled together to deal with the trauma. Anthony left his position and then, after a few years, with both children at university, the couple decided to move to Bali permanently, where they now live. \u201cBali for us had always been really healing, and it was actually a very healing place for me personally,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cAnd, it just seemed to be another one of those risks that I didn\u2019t really want to take but I think that Elle saw the opportunities here, and it\u2019s been pretty amazing. It\u2019s deepened our relationship even more, [even though] we\u2019ve had some really tough times while we\u2019ve been here, missing the kids, and missing family.\u201d Initially they taught in local schools but now they have set up a business together leading retreats and workshops on conscious parenting and creating conscious relationships. They\u2019re excited by the opportunities but they know to keep work and family life separate. Danielle says: \u201c[After] being in an industry or a profession that does encompass your whole being, we know that we need to set those boundaries, and so far so good.\u201d Anthony says throughout their relationship, whenever they\u2019ve found themselves in a lull, they\u2019ve looked for something new and different \u2013 something Danielle is very happy to come up with: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of gypsy at heart, so I like to move around and I like to try new things. Anthony likes stability, so sometimes I feel like I might be dragging him out of his comfort zone but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been a bad thing either, because I think you\u2019ve learnt a lot about yourself, and we grow together that way.\u201d They\u2019ve never tried to change the other: \u201cIt was more of an acceptance. Even if there was something that we didn\u2019t necessarily like about each other, there was a way of\u2026 talking about it, and facing it ,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cThere was always an understanding of mutual trust and respect of the fact that sometimes I needed to do something different, or Elle needed to do something [different] \u2026 there wasn\u2019t an expectation to change, there was an expectation of us working together.\u201d Their commitment to each other has remained unbreakable. Danielle says: \u201cThat commitment was never about [staying] together forever now because we\u2019re married. It was about this is a human being who\u2019s growing and evolving, and I\u2019m a human being who\u2019s growing and evolving and we can do that together.\u201d \u2022 We want to hear your stories about staying together.
