I have spent \u00a3300 on online bingo, without ever playing bingo in my life. Another \u00a3200 has been withdrawn at cash dispensers, then even worse - I have paid for two Tesco mobile top-ups. Impossible. The word Tesco is poison to me. On ethical grounds I have never spent a groat in there. I can only assume some robbers have copied my debit card. But what clots they are. The bingo money has all returned. Their winnings have gone straight back into my account. I cancel my card, I visit the bank, and while I'm sitting there describing the robbery, thinking everything's under control, up comes a mini-statement with another \u00a31,000 gone and I am cleaned out. I feel rather faint. The robbers managed to squander it just before I found them out, and while I was trudging round the sales trying to be frugal. \"We've had hundreds of people come in to report this sort of thing,\" says the bank person. But how do the robbers do it? They put something in the cash machine to copy your card, says he, and sit opposite in a car, cloning away. I shall never, ever use a stinking cash machine again. Whose silly idea was it to phase out cheque books and force us all to use beastly plastic? Next day, a letter from the bingo people arrives, thanking me for joining. How do they know my address? What a fright. Is it on the strip on my card? What else do they know? I ring the bank fraud person. They do it from internet shopping or telephone shopping, he says. Then they know your address, date of birth and possibly the colour of your knickers. What a nasty feeling this is. Somewhere, someone, at any time, could be frittering wads of your money, and you won't know a thing about it until you get your statement, weeks later. Who are these stinkers? They must be frightfully busy. They did it to Rosemary a few months ago, and to another friend, and to a woman I met last night at a play. She blames the waiters in restaurants who have hidden cloning equipment in their trousers, or who peer at your pin. What are we meant to do about it? Don't let your card out of your sight. Crouch over the pin machine with your whole body and snarl at waiters. Better still, never use a debit or credit card again, or a cash machine, or pay a bill, or book tickets, or holidays by phone. Rosemary and I plan to cut the dangerous debit cards up into tiny pieces and then melt them down so that the hordes of robbers poking through our rubbish don't find them. Then we can plod to the bank every week, draw out cash and use that. Or write cheques. \"We have a lot of cheque fraud too,\" says the bank fraud person. What a world. It seems to be packed with robbers. Even in the banks. Lloyds TSB is so worried about insider fraud that it plans to install software to protect against rascally employees. Blimey. My father was right. \"Beware of rogues and scoundrels who will always surround you,\" he once wrote, having been ripped off by three different work colleagues in succession. But one good thing. The bank says it will pay me back. They've paid back Rosemary already. Poor banks. How ever do they manage? Credit, debit and store card fraud was down 3% in 2006, but still cost them more than \u00a3400m. No wonder they're now trying to recoup a smidgen, by charging extra for the use of plastic cards abroad, just in time for the summer hols. Not so poor banks. Meanwhile, Rosemary is sticking to travellers' cheques. \"There must be a moral to this story,\" says she. But I can't think of one. Here's another trick to watch out for, when hiring a car. My friends the Fieldings hired one to collect their daughter and a mountain of books from her university at the end of term. \"You can return the van on Sunday night, and save on the congestion charge,\" said the salesperson. Silly Mrs Fielding thought he was doing her a favour. Two days later she gets a bill for \u00a3300 and a letter accusing her of damaging the car. This sum has been removed from her account. What damage? The Fieldings never saw any. Mrs Fielding is innocent. She rushes round to the car-hire place in a temper. Where is this damage? She wants to see the car. She can't - it's out with another customer. She can see it on Saturday. Oh ha ha, thinks Fielding. What a clever wheeze. Tell your customers to leave the car outside, then whack it with a sledge hammer, swear you found it like that in the morning, win \u00a3300 (ie keep the deposit), do not go to jail. Because while it was outside, it was still the customers' responsibility, and how can they prove they didn't do it? But who is to say the hire company didn't do it? Then more suspicious news. Mrs Fielding chats to a local shopkeeper about this business, and guess what? The same car-hire firm did it to him, too. Someone's fibbing, and it isn't the Fieldings. I've known them for years. They are truth itself. No moral in this story either. This week Michele saw The Great Theatre of the World, a 17th-century mystery play by Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, adapted by Adrian Mitchell. \"Desperate but very funny. Calderon's predictions about the environment were spot on, and the rich man goes to hell. If only.\" Michele also saw The Chase on TV: \"Stuffed with dramas and animals - perfect for taking your mind off banks.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
