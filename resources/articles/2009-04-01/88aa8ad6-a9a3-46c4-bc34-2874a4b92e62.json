That Blechacz is highly talented there is no doubt, but on the evidence of his latest London appearance he has still a good way to go before he can be mentioned in the same breath as his Polish compatriots such as Zimerman and Anderszewski. What is missing is a real musical personality, that priceless ability to give whatever he plays a distinctive stamp. Blechacz offers enthusiasm, energy and a decent technique; what he doesn't have is a beautiful piano sound or much variation in it, and nothing he played in this recital had any real sense of revelation. There is a likable warmth and directness to his playing, though, and the way he launched into Bach's Italian Concerto to begin had a disarmingly honest quality. The Bach was the most impressive item in the first half. The Mozart sonata that followed, K570 in B flat, was all a bit too well-mannered, and Szymanowski's beefy Variations in B flat minor, which began like lugubrious Brahms and ended like overwrought Chopin, struggled for coherence, though it would be unfair to entirely blame Blechacz. A sequence of Chopin occupied the second half. If the Op 62 nocturnes and Op 17 mazurkas at its centre were robbed of their magic by a particularly fidgety Wigmore audience, the A flat major Ballade and A flat Polonaise flanking them at least had some dramatic presence, though there was no real edge of excitement to either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
