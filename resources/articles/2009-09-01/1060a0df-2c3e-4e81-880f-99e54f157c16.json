They showed enough against Bolton to suggest that Paul Hart, the bookmakers' tip for the season's first sacking, is doing an admirable job in difficult circumstances. First, the combativeness shown in a robust game proved Portsmouth's manager has not allowed the players' spirit to sink amid predictions of certain relegation. Second, the air of negativity has, perversely, led to an adventurous playing style \u2013 towards the tail end of last term Portsmouth became a dull side who just about crawled to survival, but here they attacked with gusto. They are, of course, also a different side in the literal sense. Fratton Park has experienced more arrivals and departures than many airports, hence Hart fielded five debutants in the course of this game and only one player, Younes Kaboul, remained from the team that started their final match of last season. Which brings us to a third encouraging factor for Portsmouth: fans may grumble that the quality of the club's cut-price recruits is far below that of sold stars such as Glen Johnson, Peter Crouch and Niko Kranjcar, but some of the new players looked promising. Jamie O'Hara, on loan from Tottenham, was dynamic and inventive in the heart of midfield, his set-piece prowess a valuable bonus. It was from one of his corners that Kaboul headed a 25th-minute equaliser to Tamir Cohen's opening goal for the visitors. Subsequent O'Hara corners provoked further panic in the opposition area, and he also went close from a free-kick. Meanwhile, the \u00a34m forward Kevin-Prince Boateng at times looked lost at the tip of Portsmouth's midfield diamond but, when he did get on the ball, bristled with menace. A powerful run and shot in the first half was bettered in the 63rd minute by his team's second goal, pouncing from 12 yards after O'Hara's effort had been blocked. That equalised Matt Taylor's penalty, awarded in the 41st minute after another impressive Portsmouth debutant, Tal Ben Haim, had been harshly adjudged to have fouled Kevin Davies. Two more recent signings, Tommy Smith and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piquionne, were vibrant up front and with better finishing could have struck winners before Gary Cahill's decisive late header for Bolton. \"There was an awful lot of positives from that display,\" enthused Hart. \"I thought the new players did extremely well, especially considering we've only been together for two weeks. We can be very competitive.\" Even Bolton's performance offered hope for Portsmouth, since the key to the visitors' cohesion seemed to be the absence of an extravagant signing. Seemingly feeling obliged to deploy the \u00a310m striker Johan Elmander up front, Gary Megson had in recent weeks shunted Kevin Davies to the right-hand side of midfield but with Elmander injured for this match, Davies regained his preferred position and the Icelandic full-back Gretar Steinsson ventured into midfield, where he surprisingly emerged as the team's most creative force. So the unexpected can happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
