The South Africa international is refusing to accept the \u00a360,000-a-week contract extension that Everton offered before the end of last season and would become a free agent when his current deal expires next summer. Tottenham Hotspur have again been linked with the 28-year-old but Moyes insists he is under no pressure to sell the player he bought for \u00a32m from Borussia Dortmund. He is prepared to hold Pienaar to the final 12 months of his contract in the absence of a substantial offer or agreement with Everton. \"We have not had an offer for Steven and if anyone does make an offer they will need a sack-load of cash because I am not interested in selling,\" the Everton manager said. \"At the moment the board are not telling me to sell Steven Pienaar either. \"He was our player of the year last season and we don't want him to go. We have made him a really good offer but he's not accepting our offer. It's as simple as that. I don't know where it goes from there, but he knows and so do his people.\" Pienaar is seeking a deal in the region of Mikel Arteta's new \u00a375,000-a-week contract before following the Spaniard, Tim Cahill, Jack Rodwell, Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman in committing his future to Goodison Park this summer, and has admitted he will stay at the club if the money is right. \"I'm happy to sign a new one, but at my age it has to be right and fair,\" Pienaar said. \"The only difference I've had with the club has been over what's right. There's been a lot of speculation about a transfer but I've never once said that I want to leave Everton.\" Moyes would sell Yakubu Ayegbeni for around \u00a39m, but has only received a \u00a36m bid from West Ham United for the Nigerian striker so far, while there has been no contact from Celtic regarding the defender Joseph Yobo. James Vaughan is a target for Blackpool but they are unable to meet his current wages. The Everton manager admitted he attempted to sign Bellamy from Manchester City before his loan move to Cardiff City this week, although, with City unwilling to subsidise the striker's \u00a395,000-a-week salary to the same extent in the Premier League, a deal for the Welshman was beyond his means. \"We had a genuine interest but when I heard what the deal would cost I knew we wouldn't be able to do it,\" Moyes said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
