I'd like to see Emile Heskey and Trevor Sinclair making more driving runs into the box because I don't think we're getting enough bodies into the danger zone. As we saw against Nigeria, Michael Owen is often our only player in the area when balls are coming in from the flank. If England are going to have David Beckham out wide, they've got to make more use of the fact that he's one of the world's best crossers. Heskey regularly comes out to the left to link up play with Sinclair, and from there the ball is often switched to Beckham or Danny Mills on the right. Beckham likes to take no more than one or two touches before putting in a cross and can be relied on to swing over decent balls. The trouble is Owen is too often the only man in a goal-scoring position. He's usually at the near post and, if he misses the ball or it flies beyond him, there's no one there to follow things up. It is hard in this heat but I'd like to see Heskey power his way to the far post and Sinclair make determined runs into the area . Then, with Paul Scholes around the edge of the box for the ball that drops there, England have got four men in scoring positions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
