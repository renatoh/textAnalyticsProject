I wrote an analysis of Obama's bounce on Monday, trying to place it in a larger context. My conclusion was there can be little doubt that Obama received some bounce coming out of the Democratic national convention. I will not, however, be updating this piece daily with each and every piece of new polling information. The media and our society thrive on the constant updating of news, but the fact is that there's little else meaningful to add about the bounce at this point \u2013 until there's more data and we can get a clear read. Yes, there is evidence that Obama's bounce is continuing. Gallup has President Obama jumping out to his largest lead in its tracker since April. It also has his approval holding at 50%. But we can also find evidence that Obama's bounce is receding. The ABC/Washington Post poll had Obama's lead at six points among all voters on Friday. By Saturday and Sunday, Obama and Mitt Romney were \"about evenly matched among registered voters\". On the state level, things are just as frustrating. Public Policy Polling had Obama's Ohio lead at 5 points. That's higher than their previous poll, but only by 2 percentage points. They saw no bounce for Obama in North Carolina. SurveyUSA recorded an expanding Obama edge in Minnesota, but not in Washington. The overall picture can only be described as murky at this point. I only know that President Obama is likely in the lead. Beyond that, individual polls differ considerably in their snapshot of where this race stands. My advice has been and continues to be to allow the situation to settle. We won't know the ultimate effect of the conventions on the race for president until at least a week from both conventions. John McCain led in the polling average through 16 September 2008, before Obama overtook him for good \u2013 nearly two weeks after the end of the Republican national convention (which went second that year). That's why you won't find me pontificating on any definite effect of either convention until early next week or about 17 September. Only then will we begin to know who \"won the conventions\", and whether President Obama received a temporary bounce or sustained boost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
