BT shareholders are being given the right to buy an extra three shares for every 10 they own. The rights issue shares are priced at 300p each, a deep discount to yesterday's close of 450p and 47% less than when the move was announced. BT hopes to raise \u00a35.9bn. Why? BT has debts of \u00a330bn. In the last financial year it lost \u00a31bn before tax but has promised to cut debts by \u00a310bn by the year's end. Several investments and properties have been sold; costs of building mobile networks are to be shared. BT will be split in two: its fixed line business and BT Wireless, including Cellnet. What's in it for investors? The chance to pick up cheap BT shares. Shareholders must either take up their rights or end up owning proportionally fewer shares. Those who decline will have their \"rights\" sold and receive a cheque. What's the outlook for BT? Bulls say the shares have dropped too low, new chairman Sir Christopher Bland is starting to solve problems, disposals are helping, the demerger of BT Wireless is strategically sensible and the rights issue will offer stability. Bears saythe shares are likely to continue to slide in a market where telecoms stocks have fallen out of favour. What will the City do? Other telecoms firms are trying to sell shares to institutions, so it is a buyers' market. BT's biggest shareholders have given a reluctant thumbs-up. And small investors? Many of the 1.8m small shareholders remain undecided. Novice investors feel aggrieved by the loss of the shares' value and may not take up their rights. Others may give BT a second chance. How long do investors have to make up their minds? Almost no time at all. Acceptance forms must be with be with BT's registrars by 9.30am tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
