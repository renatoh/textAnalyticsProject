Hemingway spent two winters in the Montafon, lured by the cheap prices, the beauty of the mountains and - of course - the bars (the locals dubbed him the \"kirsch-drinking Christ\"). \"Skiing was not the way it is now,\" he later recalled. \"There were no ski patrols. Anything you ran down from, you had to climb up. That gave you legs that were fit to run down with.\" It is difficult to imagine what Hemingway would make of the Montafon valley now, with its multi-seater chairlifts served by conveyer belts, snow-making machines and floodlit toboggan runs. But beyond the technological improvements, much of what persuaded him to visit the area in 1924 and to return in 1925 is still luring visitors to the Montafon. A lower profile than the neighbouring resorts of Lech and St Anton has meant the Montafon remains relatively cheap and unspoilt by the high-rise building that goes with bigger resorts. The skiing offers plenty of variety, from the small resort of Golm to the much bigger Silvretta Nova ski area, and with a ski pass costing \u20ac163 it's a good 20% cheaper than many of the better known Austrian resorts. Although the Montafon is probably best suited to intermediates - the Silvretta Nova has just one black slope - there is plenty of off-piste skiing to be done and the area is particularly well known as a base for ski touring. The Montafon is also a family resort and it plays to its strengths with special family deals where kids ski for free in off-peak weeks. There is also the \"Activpark\", a giant leisure centre with a covered ice rink where you can check out your curling skills or watch ice hockey. A highlight - for small and big kids alike - has to be the floodlit toboggan run in the Silvretta Nova. With six kilometres of hairpin bends to zoom down, this is a far cry from most British sledging experiences. As you head up in a rickety chairlift clutching your wooden sledge, the route down looks somewhat challenging. But doing this at night is a definite advantage - the lights enable you to see where you're going, but not where you'd end up if you accidentally overshot one of those bends. As with beginner skiing, you'll have to resign yourself to getting overtaken by grinning 12-year-olds, and to getting snow in places you never imagined possible. But it's brilliant fun and not to be missed, and the post-sledging schnapps tastes all the better for the wait. Getting there As no British tour operators go to the Montafon, you'll have to make your own way there. Fortunately, this is now pretty straightforward not to mention cheap thanks to the Ryanair route from Stansted into Friedrichshafen, just over the German border and about an hour's drive away. Many hotels offer transfers or you can get the shuttle bus (airport-bus.at) to Bludenz station for \u20ac30 (single) or \u20ac57 (return). Where to stay The tourist office (0043 (0)5556 722530; montafon.at) can organise hotel and pension packages, with prices for a week's accommodation and six-day ski pass ranging from \u20ac280 for bed and breakfast to \u20ac469 for half-board accommodation in a hotel. At the top end of the scale the Hotel Roessle (00 43 5558 8333-0, posthotel-roessle.at) in Gaschurn offers easy access to the main Silvretta Nova ski area with lifts just five minutes' walk away. It also boasts an overnight stay by the great man himself - Hemingway's bed is proudly displayed on the second floor. You can see why he liked it - the walls are lined with mounted stags' heads and pictures of beefy, macho-looking Austrian mountaineers. Though who he spent the night with is less clear. Hemingway came to the Montafon on holiday with his wife but when the family that runs the hotel discovered a lost negligee and posted it on to his wife, she sent it back. The nightdress, it seems, was not hers. Where to eat You certainly won't go hungry - or thirsty - in the Montafon. The Silvretta Nova alone boasts eight restaurants with one, the Bella Nova (0043 (0) 5557 63000; silvrettanova.at), claiming to have the biggest ski-bar in Europe. It may not offer the glitz of some resorts, but there is something here to suit most tastes, from cosy log huts where you can nurse a coffee and a schnapps while you wait for the sun to come back out to open-air discos where you can swing your beer glass to the acquired taste that is Austrian live music. There are plenty of congenial places to go for authentic local food - no one comes to Austria to diet - in the villages dotted around the mountains. You won't struggle to find a decent fondue, but you'll get a particularly good one at the Gasthof Kreuz in Schruns (0043(0) 5556 72117), one of the two villages (the other is Tschagguns) that form the main centre of the valley. Homemade strudel is the speciality of the Muntanella restaurant in St Gallenkirch (0043 (0)55576230; muntanella.at), where owner Renate serves up many different varieties alongside the traditional apple. You can also admire her husband's impressive collection of beer bottles from around the world - though the kind served up in a glass at your table will probably be of more interest after a hard day on the slopes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
