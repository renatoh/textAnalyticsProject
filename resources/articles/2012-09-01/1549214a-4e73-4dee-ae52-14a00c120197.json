A 35-runner contest with an unpredictable draw advantage makes limited appeal as a betting event, but the GoingStick readings suggest that the stands' rail could prove the best place to be and Mijhaar is well positioned in that respect in stall 32. Far too keen for his own good at Royal Ascot, he excelled himself in finishing third in the circumstances and was then beaten through no fault of his own when clipping heels and all but coming down in the John Smith's Cup. Last time at Kempton, he was unable to get on terms after a slow start, but that contest should have put him spot-on for this and the big field and likely end-to-end gallop should help to curb his freegoing tendencies. There are few better trainer when it comes to laying one out for a big handicap than William Haggas and Mukhadram must be a live player, although the value in his price has long since departed. Newmarket 1.55 Having looked in trouble two furlongs out, Steeler rallied with some purpose to win at Goodwood last time and he is crying out for this move up to a mile. His previous second to Dundonnell should not be undervalued despite that horse's subsequent defeat at Doncaster. Market Rasen 2.10 Kept back for this contest since winning a similar valuable contest over course and distance in July, Local Hero may be able to confirm form with the second, third and fourth despite a rise in the weights. Newmarket 2.25 As a long-term prospect she is lacking a little scope, but the diminutive Maureen has the speed to account for these rivals. With better luck she would be going into this race with her unbeaten record still intact. Market Rasen 2.40 Second in this race 12 months ago, Buck Mulligan looks to have been laid out for a repeat bid. He shaped nicely over hurdles last time out. Newmarket 3.00 A good third behind Excelebration and Cityscape at Deauville last month, Elusive Kate is back against her own sex here. She should be able to deploy her usual positive tactics in this smallish field and has reportedly been working particularly well in recent weeks. Haydock 3.15 Beaten only three lengths in a red-hot contest off a higher mark on his last venture into handicaps, Elusivity could be worth chancing with a good apprentice booked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
