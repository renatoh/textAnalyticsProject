I\u2019m afraid you have to love, those lions aren\u2019t going to feed themselves. So that\u2019s it for another show \u2013 shall we do it all again next week? Kick off is at 6.50pm, so join me then. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you fancy giving me a wave \u2013 thank you as ever for joining in with your joyous comment box contributions. Have a great week, and keep dancing! Hx Emma is genuinely distraught. I think she might have been a little bit in love with Aljaz, and who can blame her? He may well be the nicest man on the planet, and I can also confijrm he smells DIVINE. All the judges vote to save Mike and Katya, which means Emma and Aljaz are leaving the Strictly dancefloor. I\u2019m always sad to see Aljaz go, but Emma\u2019s struggle with Latin was always going to make it hard for her to progress in the competition. With Will also leaving this week, at least Aljaz and Janette get to spend quality couple time together. Dance off time! Emma and Aljaz are up first, still dancing the the world\u2019s most ladylike Samba. A couple of sambucas would not have gone amiss \u2013 if anything this is even more lacklustre than last night. Time for Mike\u2019s Charleston \u2013 his feet still point inwards on the swivel and the lifts are still perilous, but none of these things seemed to matter last night so there\u2019s no reason to suspect they will now. So who else is safely through to pre-Blackpool? Alex and Kevin/Neil are safe, along with Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni and Saffron and AJ! Which means Emma and Aljaz are joining Mike and Katya in tonight\u2019s dance off. Based on last night\u2019s scores, it\u2019s likely that Emma will be heading back to scrubbing rhinos at Longleat and Mike will continue to prove harder to get rid of than a Scottish ten pound note in Norwich. Motsi\u2019s dress looks like the google result for \u2018sexy Halloween mummy costume\u2019. She is accompanied by some Aljaz/Luba barefoot contempo-waft, alongside a routine from Johannes and Graziano - the first time a same-sex individual pair has been featured on Strictly. It\u2019s a lovely thing to see, and will hopefully demonstrate to certain corners of the press that the world will not end if two men touch each other on the BBC\u2019s flagship show. Well that was gorgeous and uplifting. I know we were all sad about Johannes leaving last week, but in the immortal words of Maria Von Trapp, when god closes a door, somewhere he opens a window. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of singer/songwriter and Strictly stalwart Emili Sande, who is singing her single \u2018Shine\u2019. If you ever need a party game, try saying all of that with a mouthful of Maltesers. So who is safely through to next week? Chris and Karen are safe, along with Emma and Anton (OOOH) and Karim and Amy. First couple in the bottom two: MIKE AND KATYA. So the public saved Emma and Anton, no doubt due to the judges being a bit harsh on Emma for choreography that really wasn\u2019t her fault. Meanwhile Mike and Katya were 6th (out of 9) on the leaderboard, so it seems the public weren\u2019t nearly as keen on his Charleston as the judges were. Last night on Strictly: Karim and Amy smashing the Quickstep, a fun and charming Foxtrot from Alex and not-Neil, plus the usual array of overmarking and undermarking that gives us something to chunter about. I suspect we\u2019ll be saying goodbye to one of the Emmas this evening, but couldn\u2019t tell you which one. Not sure I want to watch either again, to be honest. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in yet another high-necked roasting bag, Claudia looking rather fabulous in sparkly red and white. Tonight\u2019s pro dance features a medley of Elton John songs, kicking off with Aljaz looking resplendent in a couple of dead swans. There\u2019s a LOT of polyester in this routine. And we\u2019re off! Every time I watch these credits I\u2019m surprised to see James Cracknell. Had completely forgotten he was on this show. Incidentally, if you missed the Countryfile Casual Weather earlier, it was the lovely Sarah Keith-Lucas in a frock that wouldn\u2019t look out of place at one of Emma Longleat\u2019s garden parties. Not so much as a casual cardigan, she clearly didn\u2019t get the memo. I miss the gentle meanderings of pre-Strictly Countryfile. Attenborough is amazing, but there\u2019s too much clifftop peril and furry death for Sunday teatime. I want chat about orchard management and pig husbandry in Sussex. Maybe a short interlude where people with beards weave stuff out of twigs. Craven hawking a calendar like he\u2019s got a target to hit before his annual performance review. Evening all, and welcome back for tonight\u2019s Strictly Results Show! Last night was another Strictly rollercoaster of twists and turns, from \u2018ooh that was worth a nine\u2019 to \u2018why was that worth a nine?\u2019. I\u2019ve given up trying to work out the judges\u2019 rationale, it seems to vary from week to week. That way madness lies, so I\u2019m inclined to just enjoy the ride. Tonight we another couple into the Strictly sunset \u2013 the leaderboard suggests it will be a battle of the Emmas, but it\u2019s been somewhat unpredictable of late. Kick off is at 7.15pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! I\u2019ll be back here at 7.15pm tomorrow for the Results Show, so join me then. Thank you as ever for joining in and being amazing, enjoy the rest of your Saturday and never return to a lit firework. Until tomorrow! Hx So that\u2019s it for the dancing, and the voting is open! Karim and Amy are at the top of the leader board, with Emma and Anton at the bottom \u2013 if you want further details, can confirm that everyone else was somewhere in between. My faves this evening were definitely Kelvin and Oti and Alex and Kevin, we could well be lining up for both Emmas in the dance-off tomorrow, who do you think will go? Scores: 7,7,8,8 \u2013 a total of 30 for Mike and Katya. I mean, sure. Why not. Shirley loved the energy, but there were a few mistakes. Bruno thought it was cheeky and charming and Mike sold it like a showman, but lots of errors. Craig agrees on the timing, but he loved the musical comedy. Motsi thought it lost energy but it was a lot of fun. This is a masterclass in Charleston slapstick and characterisation, which Mike is very good at. However it\u2019s stompy, lacks swivel, has turned in feet (DRINK), and has quite a few mistakes and timing issues. Who knows if the judges will notice? And finally this evening it\u2019s MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines\u2019 by the Ron Goodwin Orchestra. Has Mike really not done a Charleston yet? I feel like every week has been a Charleston. Scores: 5,6,5,6 \u2013 a total of 22 for Emma and Anton. Bit harsh, I think. Motsi wants Emma to keep pushing, she can see her potential. Shirley thought the timing was completely off \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if it was Emma\u2019s fault or Anton\u2019s choreography. Anton chunters on over Shirley, which won\u2019t win him any votes in the dance-off. Bruno thought it lacked perpetual Cuban motion but Emma gave it a good go. Craig wasn\u2019t keen on the free arm placement, but the leg extension and storytelling were great. Emma looks glorious with a fringe, it really suits her. Some nice foot placement and leg action in this Rumba, which is a good distraction from Anton\u2019s Bruce Forsyth sexy time face. A really good effort, quite enjoyed that. Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! This week they\u2019re dancing the Rumba to \u2018Woman In Love\u2019 by Barbra Streisand. Emma implied last week that this was going to be quite hot, which leaves me quite torn \u2013 I love a filthy Rumba, but not necessarily if it involves a snake-hipped Anton. Scores: 8, 9,9,8 \u2013 a total of 34 for Chris and Karen. I\u2019ve entered a parallel universe, and I do not like it. Loving the sparkly bucket hats, but that\u2019s really the highlight of this routine for me. It\u2019s great fun, but if you\u2019re going to dance street you need the moves. And if you don\u2019t have the moves, at least dance in time. It\u2019s a no from me. Craig thought that was sick, and I think he means it in a good way. Motsi thought it was Chris\u2019s best dance, and Shirley thought it was so entertaining, they looked like actual street dancers. Bruno thought they were almost right on time. Am I drunk? Couple\u2019s Choice alert, it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN: This week they\u2019re dancing a Street/Commercial routine to \u2018Let\u2019s Get Ready to Rhumble\u2019 by PJ and Duncan. A brief history lesson for those of your who don\u2019t remember 1994 - before Ant &amp; Dec were the biggest thing on TV, there was Byker Grove, baggy jeans, floppy hair and so many lyrics they were frightened to use \u2018em. I highly recommend the video on Youtube when you have a minute, it\u2019s the most 1990s thing you will ever see. Chris\u2019s mum and dad! DRINK! Chris\u2019s wife and adorable son! DRINK! Scores: 7,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 31 for Alex and Kevin. Bruno is loving to see how Alex is growing in confidence, but she needs to work on her musical phrasing. Craig thought we saw Alex for the first time this evening, and this accidental partnership is working wonders (poor Neil). Motsi loved the quality of the movement, Alex just needs to work on her consistency. Shirley is enjoying the artistry and footwork, I missed the end of that critique because I accidentally changed channels whilst reaching for an oven chip. Alex\u2019s red dress is one of the most fabulous I\u2019ve seen in a while, and this American Smooth has bags of cheeky charm and style. Sad that Neil can\u2019t dance this week, but Kevin is doing him proud and there\u2019s a lovely chemistry here considering they\u2019ve been thrown together since last week. It\u2019s a little untidy in places, but Alex is the Journey of the series for me \u2013 what a transformation. Next up it\u2019s ALEX AND KEVIN! Neil is still injured, so Kevin is stepping in for another week. Judging by the comments on Instagram, this appears to have upset a great many people who have far too much time on their hands. Anyway, this week Alex and Kevin are dancing the American Smooth to \u2018Ain\u2019t No Mountain High Enough\u2019 by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. I\u2019d have preferred the one about how the world is just a great big onion, but let\u2019s go with this for now. Scores: 6,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 27 for Saffron and AJ. Shirley thought it was a power-packed routine, but Saffron\u2019s hip rotation wasn\u2019t great and her feet were turned in (DRINK). Bruno is punch drunk (standard), and he\u2019s not sure those lifts were legal. There was some loss of balance and the timing wasn\u2019t on it in places \u2013 it was \u2018mental but fabulous\u2019. Craig agrees that it lacked fluidity, but it did have some dynamic moments. Motsi loved Saffron\u2019s risk taking and the beginning was amazing, but she needs to clean it up and keep the energy. I have no idea why this has a basketball theme, but let\u2019s go with it. Nice starting basket from AJ, but I\u2019m not sure that hoop is a regulation height. Saffron is in her element here \u2013 lots of sass and party energy, but it feels a bit laboured in places and the lifts look a bit clunky. The timing goes a bit awry towards the end, and Saffron suddenly looks quite out of her depth. A shame. It\u2019s time for SAFFRON AND AJ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Instruction\u2019 by Jax Jones featuring Demi Lovato and Stefflon Don. This is a stone cold banger with a proper carnival vibe, am very much hoping one of the Dave Arch singers goes all in on the Stefflon Don interlude. Scores: 8,9,8,9 \u2013 a total of 34 for Kelvin and Oti. Motsi loved how they captured the mood of the dance, it was outstanding. Shirley wanted it to be flatter, there was too much rise and fall for a Viennese (see? Ten years have not been wasted), but she loved the emotional elements. Bruno loved the storytelling and emotional tonality, it was light as a feather and soft as a caress. Craig agrees with Shirley \u2013 too much rise and fall, but the storytelling was super. God I love watching these two dance, it\u2019s always incredibly special. Kelvin has a beautiful lyrical quality to his dancing and Oti is a goddess. Might a bit too much rise and fall for a Viennese, but what the hell do I know. Goosebumps stuff right there. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Say Something\u2019 by A Great Big World and Christina Aguilera. This song is hauntingly beautiful, and I have high hopes for Kelvin and Oti giving us a Viennese to match. Tess has a chat with Will, who is gutted to be out of the competition. He\u2019s hoping to be fit for Tokyo 2020, a stark reminder that he might have waved goodbye to a Paralympic gold medal in pursuit of a Halloween-themed Jive. Fingers crossed it\u2019s nothing serious. Scores: 5,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 26 for Emma and Aljaz. Craig liked the energy, but technically it was a bit sloppy and messy in places. Motsi thought Emma\u2019s body coordination was good, and her personality kept it up. Shirley loved the closed hold throughout and she definitely saw some bounce, but Emma needs to work on her posture. Bruno would definitely come to Emma\u2019s party, and it was a great job of a very hard dance. We this starts with promise, and Emma has enviably swingy hair. There are some timing issues here, and some of the transitions are pretty clunky. There\u2019s no question that Emma\u2019s dancing has come on significantly this year, but it still feels a bit like she\u2019s dancing the Samba whilst trying to hold a 50p between her bum cheeks. Can someone loosen her corset? It\u2019s time for EMMA AND ALJAZ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Samba to \u2018I Don\u2019t Care\u2019 by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber. This was one of my fave songs of the summer, hopefully Emma will tackle it with a suitable level of party abandon. Scores: 8,9,9,8 \u2013 a total of 34 for Michelle and Giovanni. Bruno thought it was clean, clear and menacing, but Michelle could have extended the shapes more. Craig agrees \u2013 he wanted more extension in the shaping, but there was purpose and passion. Motsi loved the intensity between Michelle and Giovanni, it was a different interpretation and she liked it. Shirley loved that there was no flash and no trash, executed with exquisite timing. Think I need to watch that again. Michelle\u2019s outfit has got quite a lot going on, making it difficult to appreciate her shaping. Some nice flamenco elements in the middle, but it feels a bit tentative and needs more aggression and passion. Loved the routine, but I wanted a bit\u2026more? Next up it\u2019s MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019 by Queen. I loved their Foxtrot last week - despite them being in the slot of death tonight, I have every hope that this is going to be skirt-swishing Latin fierceness from start to finish. Gyles Brandreth is doing the Terms &amp; Conditions. It is a thing that happened. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Karim and Amy. Well, that sets quite a bar for this evening, doesn\u2019t it? Shirley thought it was a brilliant way to start the show \u2013 Karim\u2019s frame was exquisite and his footwork was off the chart. Bruno thought it was a Saville Row quickstep tailored to the highest standard, it was absolutely perfect. Craig thought there was occasional gapping, but it was clean, precise and had lovely swing and sway \u2013 totally stunning. Motsi thought Karim killed it, it was the best start ever. Well this is fun \u2013 apart from the tailoring being slightly alarming on the eyeballs, Karim is nailing this Quickstep \u2013 he has a lovely frame and his footwork is outstanding. Super stylish and classy, enjoyed that a lot. First up tonight it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Quickstep to \u2018Mr. Pinstripe Suit\u2019 by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. We already know that Karim has incredible footwork, and he\u2019s finally been given a song that is an appropriate fit for the dance. I have very high hopes for this being a ten-tastic start to tonight\u2019s dancing. Out come the judges! Shirley has had a hospital procedure this week, but great to see her still on the show and looking fabulous. And now the stars \u2013 Karim and Amy are clashing horribly. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in an electric blue sparkle pantsuit, like Sandy from Grease meets Avatar. Claudia in ill-fitting power shoulders. And we\u2019re off! We\u2019re halfway through, and it\u2019s all about positivity and purpose. So many training room poppies \u2013 DRINK! Look, I\u2019m part of an extensive military family and fully support the incredible work of the Royal British Legion, but if any of the poppies we see in the training room weren\u2019t pinned on by a production assistant and immediately removed once the cameras stopped rolling, I\u2019ll eat my poppy hat. Tonight\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo: a swig of leftover rugby lager for any occurrence of the following: Early mentions of Blackpool Incongruous training room poppies Previously unseen relatives Sickled feet A ten from Craig (in the immortal words of The Weeknd, I feel it coming) Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing Liveblog! We\u2019ve reached Week 7, which means we\u2019re about the crest the Strictly Hill and start freewheeling to the Grand Final on 14th December. The shambles of Halloween Week is but a distant memory, and all eyes are on the next big milestone \u2013 the Blackpool Tower Ballroom in two weeks\u2019 time. Are you excited? I\u2019m excited. Sadly we\u2019ve had to say goodbye to Will Bailey this week, who hasn\u2019t recovered from the knee injury he sustained in training last week. A real shame for him and Janette, but hopefully we\u2019ll see Will back for a Christmas special one year; he was a real highlight of this year\u2019s show. The most likely scenario is that the show will continue as normal, with just three couples in the Final; it\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in previous years when a celebrity has left. A quick update to Heidi\u2019s Hunches below \u2013 if there are only three couples in the final, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me one bit if it was Kelvin, Michelle and Karim; what\u2019s more interesting is whether Alex or Saffron can mount a series challenge and unseat one of the Big Three. I\u2019ve also moved Chris and Karen out of the danger zone \u2013 they\u2019ve got Couple\u2019s Choice this evening, which seems to be a get out of jail free card. Group 1: one eye on the final \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy Group 2: hot on their heel leads \u2013 Alex and Neil, Saffron and AJ Group 3: battling for Blackpool \u2013 Emma B and Anton, Chris and Karen Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 Mike and Katya, Emma W and Aljaz Kick off tonight is at 7pm, so grab snacks, booze and loved ones and make yourselves comfy. The comment box is open for your wit and wisdom, so get stuck in. See you then!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
