The Labour leader also rallied to the defence of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan \u2013 who had been on the receiving end of ferocious criticism from Trump \u2013 telling the crowds that he was disappointed that the mayor had been attacked during the festival of Eid. \u201cI\u2019m proud our city has a Muslim mayor \u2013 that we can chase down Islamophobia, antisemitism, any kind of racism in our society,\u201d the Labour leader said in defence of the London mayor, with whom he has often been at loggerheads on other issues. \u201cBecause racism divides, exploitation of minorities divides, brings about hatred, dislike, disdain and a horrible place for individuals to live in,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve created that sense of hatred, destroyed people\u2019s self-esteem by that form of racism, you haven\u2019t built a house, a school, trained a nurse, defended our natural world, [you have] just created a greater sense of hate and hatred that goes with it.\u201d Corbyn was speaking at Whitehall after crowds who had marched from Trafalgar Square were stopped by a police security line just short of Downing Street. The march continued to Parliament Square where the now familiar 20-foot high Trump blimp and a similarly sized robotic caricature of the president perched on a gold toilet took centre stage as part of protests. While the numbers taking part might not quite have reached the levels expected \u2013 pre-prepared placards lay in unclaimed piles in Trafalgar Square \u2013 organisers estimated that some 75,000 people had taken part. The Metropolitan police said that they would not be giving out figures. On the morning after the US president basked in the glow of a Buckingham Palace welcome, protesters from around the country slowly streamed into Trafalgar Square behind banners and placards covering the full gamut of causes mobilised in opposition to him, from climate crisis to abortion rights. When the march reached Whitehall, however, it was the leader of the opposition who elicited the loudest cheers when he addressed crowds who had been stopped by the police just short of Downing Street. \u201cI am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody,\u201d said Corbyn, an absent figure from the banquet that the Queen had hosted the night before, and which had also been boycotted by a number of political figures. \u201cI want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about the better and more peaceful world that we all want to live in.\u201d Without naming the Trumps \u2013 who he referred to as \u201cour visitors\u201d \u2013 the Labour leader urged them to: \u201cThink on, please, about a world that is aiming for peace and disarmament, that defeats racism and misogyny.\u201d The roars of approval were no doubt heard inside the Downing Street garden party being hosted at the same time by Philip May and Melania Trump. For some, Corbyn wasn\u2019t always on firm ground \u2013 eliciting shouts of \u201cget off the fence\u201d when he made a reference to Trump coming in the middle of \u201cthe debate\u201d the UK was having about its future relationship with the EU \u2013 but his speech nevertheless bookended what organisers had promised would be a noisy rejection of the US president\u2019s visit. If anything, the range of groups taking part were as diverse as previous mobilisations against Trump visits to the UK. In Trafalgar Square numbers had slowly been building up since shortly before 11am. Their numbers included Michael Hewitt, a retired clergyman from Bromley, who was wandering past the fountains holding a piece of white A4 paper with the message, \u201cToxic Trump out\u201d. \u201cI think his views are toxic, just toxic \u2013 how do you sum him up?\u201d Hewitt said. Asked what his message to Trump would be, he said: \u201cGet real, face reality of climate change and the interdependence of nations and stop being nationalistic. Patriotism is different from nationalism.\u201d Others included Saskia Vince, a 21-year-old geography student who had just returned from studying in the US and had made the journey from Surrey with her mother. \u201cI loved the country and the people and a protest like this definitely isn\u2019t about being anti-America. It\u2019s about Trump and the very dangerous things that he stands for,\u201d she said. While the square had not quite been filled, the carnival atmosphere promised by organisers was there and not even the onset of drizzle could dampen the enthusiasm of marchers who made off in the direction of parliament behind samba bands, whistles and loudspeakers. At Whitehall, the march was blocked as planned at the Women of World War II memorial, where a stage was erected for speakers who were listened to by protesters, curious tourists and the usual troops stationed behind historic addresses. \u201cAccording to Donald Trump, Meghan Markle is a nasty woman,\u201d said the general secretary of the TUC, Frances O\u2019Grady, activating pantomime boos from the crowd. \u201cWell, sisters, I am also a nasty woman! Sisters, you are nasty women, too. I\u2019ll tell you this, better to be a nasty woman than a dirty old man.\u201d Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP, elicited similar roars of approval when she told the protesters that Trump was not worthy of our respect or the office of president. \u201cWe know Britain is better than the Britain that has been pimping out the royal family for photo opportunities with Trump\u201d. By about 2.30pm, tens of thousands had gathered in Parliament Square for the second rally of the protest. Many stood on the green in the middle, listening to speakers from a small stage, while others \u2013 including the Trump baby blimp \u2013 paraded around them. Among the speakers was Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who said: \u201cWe are not going to allow you to be the representative of the United States that we believe in. A few days ago Donald Trump said that Meghan Markle was nasty. Well, frankly, I\u2019m with Meghan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
