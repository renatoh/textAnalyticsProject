It was the corporation\u2019s first live sport of any description for more than three months \u2013 unless you count the tactical missteps, managerial howlers, missed targets and frequent own goals that have characterised the government\u2019s daily press conferences. A Premier League match live on the BBC is in itself an exceptional circumstance, and this one the result of even more exceptional circumstances, prompting Lineker to immediately lead his two-man studio panel of Alan Shearer and Ian Wright in a discussion about how disappointing everything was. \u201cI just miss the fans,\u201d complained Wright. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different, Gary \u2013 it\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s football,\u201d added Shearer. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like training, but important training,\u201d surmised Lineker. It was all pleasingly frank, if not exactly encouraging. Lineker swiftly segued into a conversation about how poor much of the play has been in the opening fixtures of this strange simulacrum semi-season. The seven games completed by then had featured a combined total of two first-half goals \u2013 one of which had come in stoppage time, plus another that didn\u2019t count because the goalline technology failed \u2013 a trend of slow starting that Shearer bemoaned. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to have their dinner now and come back in 20 minutes,\u201d fretted Lineker. Inevitably the game that followed started brightly, with two splendid goals in the first 23 minutes. Much has been made of the fake crowd noise that has been added to broadcasts in an effort to make the experience of watching these behind-closed-doors matches as normal as possible. The announcer at the Vitality Stadium for the BBC\u2019s big match between Bournemouth and Crystal Palace presumably had the same idea in mind when he decided that before kick-off his choice of music \u2013 and occasionally his own voice \u2013 should be amplified to the normal match-day volume. This all particularly inconvenienced Alex Scott, who struggled make herself heard as she gamely reported from the ground. Every club has had to decide how to replace the thousands of vocal humans who normally populate their stands, the universal response being to display enormous banners bearing some of the phrases the humans might have been saying had they been present. These banners obscure empty seats but the discovery of the resumed season \u2013 one that perhaps could have been predicted \u2013 is that some of the things that add pleasingly to the atmosphere when they come from the mouths of fans are extraordinarily banal when written down. Take \u201cWe are Brighton, super Brighton from the south\u201d, for example, a song that is not only derivative but also geographically imprecise, and which was splashed behind a goal during the victory over Arsenal on BT Sport. Then there are slogans such as \u201cI\u2019m forever blowing bubbles\u201d, as seen in West Ham\u2019s defeat to Wolves on Sky, which lacked a little integrity when declared by inanimate, two\u2011dimensional and emphatically non\u2011bubble-blowing objects. There were a few genuine fans to be seen, with broadcasters able to cut to a panel of 16 supporters of each side, watching along from home, for instant reaction to key developments. Spotting the one whose feed is lagging a few seconds behind the others\u2019 and is looking po-faced rather than pleased has swiftly become one of the more entertaining distractions of our new-look game. Beyond the empty stands and enforced novelties, however, the sport has as always been split \u2013 not entirely fairly \u2013 between the dreary and the dreamy. It\u2019s not ideal, in short, but it\u2019s football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
