There was a perfect illustration of it on Thursday when England confirmed a starting lineup including Billy Vunipola and Ireland posted a team sheet lacking Conor Murray. If this was a game of snakes and ladders, England would be the side enjoying the more elevated perch. This is not to say Murray\u2019s replacement, Kieran Marmion, and Jared Payne, deputising for Rob Kearney, are not decent players, merely that England will feel quietly encouraged as they prepare to head over to join the St Patrick\u2019s Day throng in Dublin. With Vunipola back at No8 ahead of the benched Nathan Hughes, it will be harder for Ireland to gain the early physical ascendancy they need to rattle the tournament champions. Without the influential Murray, in addition, the Irish will lack one of their key tactical cogs just when they most need him. Little wonder Eddie Jones looked far chirpier than last week, despite a slightly less-slick final training session than his side have latterly been delivering. Even a potentially damp weather forecast cannot dilute the fact England are 80 minutes away from becoming the first side to claim successive Six Nations grand slams, as well as setting a world record for successive wins by a tier one nation. Jones, sensibly, has been selling this package to his players as the opportunity of a lifetime, daring his side to up their intensity and reach confidently for the loot rather than tiptoeing nervously around it. \u201cI think the team has embraced it,\u201d the Australian said. \u201cTo go from where we are to greatness will take another step of endeavour. It takes greater focus, it takes greater persistence, it takes greater emotional output. \u201cIt is like climbing up a mountain; every time you go to another level of the mountain the ground becomes more unstable, your ears hurt, your nose hurts. It is exactly the same when you are climbing the ladder of success; everything becomes a bit harder. \u201cAnd sometimes you have to just stop and say: \u2018Right, this is what is ahead of us.\u2019 Probably we weren\u2019t very good at that. In retrospect, that\u2019s my fault. We have now done that; I think the players have re\u2011equipped themselves for the challenges ahead.\u201d It was a persuasive pitch, all the more so for having struck a chord with players who, in the past, have contrived to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Danny Care, among those who know how it feels to see high hopes dashed in Dublin, reckons this is \u201cdefinitely the best team I have ever been a part of\u201d and believes England\u2019s shaky record of five defeats in their last six championship visits to Dublin is about to improve. \u201cYou look around the changing room and there are a lot of world-class players in a lot of positions,\u201d Care said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t get ahead of ourselves. Eddie has talked about success and failure and how quickly it can turn to failure. We know the pitfalls, we know how much the Irish dislike the English and how much they like spoiling the party. \u201cWe know all those things and we have to be good enough to deal with them. We\u2019re not thinking about records; all our focus is about winning a grand slam.\u201d On that front, Jones clearly hopes Watson\u2019s aerial prowess will help to neutralise Ireland\u2019s kicking game, with the predatory Jack Nowell ready to add fresh momentum later on. If Vunipola is still not quite match fit, the man described as \u201ca dumper truck with a head attached\u201d by his back-row colleague James Haskell seldom fails to make an impact. \u201cHe makes the dressing room a lot smaller,\u201d Jones added. \u201cHe has to get back on the horse and the horse has to be heavy enough to carry him. He not only adds his physical presence but he\u2019s got a wonderful character, so he\u2019ll add a lot to the team.\u201d Having disposed of Scotland 61\u201121, Jones is also determined his side do not take a step backwards now, with virtual immortality beckoning. \u201cIreland are in a very favourable position psychologically because they have nothing to fear. That makes us vulnerable. We have to work hard to get into the right mental state but we\u2019re capable of doing that. We are not \u2018most teams\u2019 \u2026 we are ready to take it to another level.\u201d Leaving nothing to chance, as ever, Jones has even enlisted the help this week of a former Chelsea goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon, who has been offering advice on how to track the arc of a high ball, traditionally a useful skill on a wet day in Dublin. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to be brilliant at the basics,\u201d Jones added. \u201cThat\u2019s how you win games of rugby, particularly away from home when the referee can be influenced by the crowd. You know the home team is going to lift in terms of their emotional intensity.\u201d England may have struggled in Dublin in the past but they have seldom been more focused. England side to face Ireland, Aviva Stadium, 5pm Saturday 18 March M Brown; A Watson, J Joseph, O Farrell, E Daly; G Ford, B Youngs; J Marler, D Hartley (capt), D Cole, J Launchbury, C Lawes, M Itoje, J Haskell, B Vunipola. Replacements J George, M Vunipola, K Sinckler, T Wood, N Hughes, D Care, B Te\u2019o, J Nowell. Howley hits back Rob Howley has defended Wales\u2019s selection policy since the 2015 World Cup which has largely stayed with tried and tested players rather than injecting new blood. The interim head coach has named an unchanged side for the second successive match, knowing victory against France in Paris tomorrow will take Wales into the top four of the world rankings if Ireland lose to England in Dublin. It would ensure Wales avoid New Zealand and England in May\u2019s World Cup draw. Wales have capped only three new players since the World Cup, the fewest of any major nation. \u201cThere is a queue of players who will be given an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the last nine years we have brought through a number at a young age but the World Cup draw is pretty important.\u201d France have made one change from the side who defeated Italy 40-18 in Rome, with S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina recalled to the second row after recovering from a back injury. Vern Cotter, who is overseeing his final match as the Scotland coach, he has made one change from the team crushed 61-21 by England at Twickenham.
