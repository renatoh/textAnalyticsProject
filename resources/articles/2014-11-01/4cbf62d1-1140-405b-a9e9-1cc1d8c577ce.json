Then they will transmit a signal to the probe instructing it to release a tiny lander craft, called Philae, and send it gliding down to the comet. The little lander will take seven hours to make its uncontrolled 20km descent. Then it will touch down on the boulder-strewn comet and \u2013 if all goes well and it avoids the boulders \u2013 it will begin a series of experiments designed to help answer a host of key scientific questions. How did the solar system form? Did comets bring water to Earth and form our oceans? Did they seed our world with organic chemicals that were the building blocks of life? Philae \u2013 which will become the first probe ever to land on a comet if all goes well on 12 November \u2013 is part of the most complex mission ever undertaken by the European Space Agency. It took 10 years to plan and build Rosetta, and a further 10 years to send it on an intricate route into deep space for its rendezvous with Comet 67P. Now it is set to carry out its riskiest, most intricate manoeuvre using a probe that has no rocket landing thrusters or guidance system. Philae will simply be pointed at its target and released into space. A target area of 1 sq km has been pinpointed on the comet\u2019s surface and Philae could land anywhere inside it, say mission controllers. \u201cYou plan for 20 years and then, in the end, you realise the probe you have worked on may touch down on a nice flat area and you are fine or it could move 10 metres to one side and hit a boulder and everything is lost,\u201d said Stephan Ulamec, manager of the Philae landing mission. \u201cTwenty years of my career \u2013 and those of my colleagues \u2013 will be boiled down to those few seconds. So, yes, it will certainly get emotional in the control room as we wait for a signal to say Philae has landed safely.\u201d Rosetta, with Philae on board, was launched from Kourou in French Guiana on 2 March 2004 and placed on a trajectory that involved three Earth fly-bys and one of Mars on its route to Comet 67P. It was not until Rosetta reached its journey\u2019s last stretch earlier this year that astronomers got their first idea of their target\u2019s appearance, its cameras revealing an object 2.5 miles in diameter that is made up of a large body with a neck of rock attached to a smaller head-like chunk. \u201cIt looks like a big rubber duck,\u201d said Rosetta Flight director Andrea Accomazzo. For the past three months, Rosetta has been sweeping round the comet, mapping its surface and analysing the gases and dust that are beginning to pour from its surface as it warms up as it nears the sun. \u201cThey have also revealed a world littered with boulders, cliffs, crags and areas of erosion,\u201d said Accomazzo. As a result, it has taken astronomers weeks of careful study to pick a landing area that seems relatively smooth and which has a sunny enough aspect to ensure Philae\u2019s solar cells remain well charged. \u201cOn all previous space missions that have involved landings on other worlds \u2013 on the Moon or Mars, for example \u2013 there have been precursor missions that have pinpointed good spots for touchdown,\u201d said Paolo Ferri, head of operations for Esa. \u201cThis is the first space mission where we have gone to a totally unknown place and have then had to work out where to land after we arrived.\u201d Rosetta staff and engineers remain confident of success but acknowledge there is a more than 20% chance the lander will strike a boulder or drop on to a steeply sloping slab of rock and flip over, leaving it unable to transmit signals to Rosetta and Earth. \u201cEssentially we are attempting a highly complex landing on an object we barely understand,\u201d said Mark McCaughrean, a senior science adviser at Esa. \u201cComet 67P weighs 10 billion tonnes and is the size of Mont Blanc. But if you were to drop it into an ocean it would float. It has the density of pinewood.\u201d The comet is also extraordinarily dark. \u201cIt only reflects 4% of the light it receives from the sun back into space,\u201d said McCaughrean. \u201cIt\u2019s as black as charcoal.\u201d Scientists are confident ice does lie below this charcoal coating \u2013 but are unsure of its exact depth. And this also poses problems. If Philae drops into a thick black layer of powder, its instruments and solar panels may become coated with dirt, limiting the craft\u2019s operations. Philae is also fitted with ice screws and harpoons that will automatically deployed when it touches down - because Comet 67P\u2019s gravity field is too weak to prevent the lander from rebounding into space. While the ice screws need a hard surface to drill into, the harpoons are designed to cope with both hard and soft material. Nevertheless, the landing is ambitious and risky: nothing like it has ever been attempted before. The scientists insist that Rosetta is already a resounding success, however. Even if Philae were to fail in some way next week, the mission is still destined to complete more than 80% of its objectives. \u201cWe have already done the really hard part in getting to a comet and have started studying it close up, something we will be doing for another year,\u201d said mission scientist Matt Taylor. \u201cA successful landing by Philae would be the icing on the cake, albeit a very dark, dusty, dirty cake.\u201d If Philae survives the hurdles that lie ahead, the lander will begin a swath of experiments aimed at unravelling the composition of comets, objects that are thought to be made up of primordial material left over from the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. A drill will carry samples from under the surface into the lander where these tiny pieces of comet will be tested by different devices. Ptolemy, designed by Professor Ian Wright of the Open University, consists of a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer that will analyse the ratios of the different isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and other elements found on Comet 67P. In this way it should be possible to determine the ratio of atoms of hydrogen to atoms of deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen) in the comet\u2019s ice. \u201cIf that is very similar to the ratio we find in water on Earth, that will be another piece of evidence to suggest comets provided Earth with its oceans,\u201d says Wright. Other instruments on Philae will include an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer that will study the chemical composition of sub-surface samples by irradiating them with x-rays and alpha particles while the Rosetta lander\u2019s magnetometer and plasma monitor will study the comet\u2019s magnetic field. At the same time instruments on Rosetta will study the plasma and dust being thrown off the comet as it travels close to the sun. Given that Rosetta\u2019s instruments are scheduled to operate for more than a year as the comet swings past the sun, the information they will provide will transform our knowledge about comets. However, this work \u2013 particularly that of Philae \u2013 is under considerable time constraints, Rosetta mission manager Fred Jansen pointed out. \u201cIf there are problems \u2013 for example with the lander\u2019s battery power levels \u2013 on 12 November we will halt its release, though that will mean a delay of two or three weeks before we can manoeuvre Rosetta back to the right point above the landing zone.\u201d And that in turn will have serious implications for the mission. Philae is not expected to survive on the surface of comet 67P beyond March. \u201cBy then, it will have got so hot on the comet, as it gets closer and closer to the sun, that Philae will no longer be able to operate,\u201d said Jansen. \u201cSo any delay means time will be lost for science. The clock is ticking all the time for this mission.\u201d At present, Comet 67P is beginning to warm up gently as it heads for its closest approach to the sun next summer. When Rosetta arrived three months ago, instruments showed about a third of a litre of water a second was evaporating from its surface. Now that rate has reached more than five litres a second, an increase that indicates the celestial fireworks that lie ahead. As 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko gets closer and closer to the sun, the rate at which ice below its surface sublimates will increase dramatically and will flow away from the comet, dragging dust and organics to produce great filaments of material which will form a glowing tail arcing behind it. \u201cThe comet is only losing a few litres of water a second at present,\u201d said McCaughrean. \u201cThat will increase to tonnes per second and by this time next year, after it has completed its journey past the sun, Comet 67P may well have lost about a metre of material from its entire surface.\u201d This whole operation will be witnessed by Rosetta, with backing from Philae. Among the signs that will be closely sought by researchers will be indications of the presence of amino acids that form the building blocks of life on Earth and which are thought likely to be found on comets. Other studies should reveal clues that will indicate one way or the other that water on Earth has cometary origins. \u201cThere is no doubt we are going to revolutionise our knowledge about comets,\u201d said mission expert Gerard Schwem. \u201cHowever, there is a limit to what these little instrument packages on Rosetta and Philae can do. \u201cThe real goal must be to bring comet material back to Earth so we can put it through the very best instruments in our laboratories. For me, that is still the ultimate goal. Really we have only just started this business of studying comets.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
