In a speech to the party's spring conference in Blackpool he also revealed that the chancellor, Gordon Brown, will join forces with him to defend the two planks of legislation in a key address on Monday on security. Ahead of what his officials described as \"one of the most important voting weeks in recent memory\", Mr Blair urged the Tories to think again about their opposition to ID cards and measures to ban the glorification of terrorism, saying that \"failure to act will only let extremists take control of the agenda\". He argued: \"These votes are not just crucial in themselves. They will send a signal one way or other of our intent on this issue.\" Mr Blair is cutting short a weekend trip to South Africa to be present for the votes on Monday and Wednesday. His remarks suggest that the government fears it may lose on ID cards on Monday even though it has made two major compromises on regularly reporting on the cost of the scheme and the need for fresh legislation if cards become compulsory. It is unusual for Mr Blair to devote so much of a set-piece speech, normally a chance to set out a long-term vision, to winning over his own side for a set of key Commons votes. The speech had originally been planned as a chance to set out the theme of people empowerment in the centenary year of Labour. He argued: \"The advent of biometric technology in a world of increased identity fraud, illegal immigration, organised crime and especially terrorism makes our proposals for ID cards not only sensible but vital for Britain's security in the 21st century.\" Turning to the terror laws, he said the violent cartoon protests illustrated the need for clearer and stronger legislation outlawing the glorification of terrorism. He admitted he was facing challenges from his backbenches not just on the new law barring indirect incitement to terrorism, but also his plans to proscribe groups glorifying terrorism. The same Tory-Labour backbench alliance was trying to prevent the police having summary powers to order internet providers that inflame extremism, he said. Mr Blair claimed: \"It simply beggars belief that we send such a signal at such a time. I profoundly disagree with the view of those who want to water down the laws against terrorism, that these laws infringe our civil liberty. Yes, freedom of speech is an ancient liberty. But it should be exercised with responsibility because if it is not another ancient liberty - the right to life - is put at risk. \"When moderate people do not take action in the face of extremism then less moderate people with their own version of extremism take control of the agenda\". The Tories have opposed the glorification laws, claiming they will restrict free speech, adding that adequate laws already exist in the statute book. The home secretary, Charles Clarke, explained the limited climbdown on identity cards.\"It is a concession because it's a different proposal than we originally had about the means of going compulsory. And it's designed to meet the concerns that some colleagues had but it's not a concession on the principle of going compulsory, which is at the core of the scheme.\" Labour backbencher Lynne Jones said she and colleagues were still opposed to the government being entitled to put an individual's identity on a national identity database from 2008 at the point at which they apply for a passport. But the Lords voted to ensure that entry on the register was only voluntary. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights campaign group Liberty, said no compulsion was acceptable, including for those renewing passports. \"If this scheme is so great people should be able to choose and vote with their feet.\" Three key days Monday: identity card bill Issue: use of compulsory rather than voluntary ID cards and use of a central database of biometric profiles of everybody in the UK, which is not kept in any other country or required by US for passports. Last rebellion: October 18 2005: 32 Labour MPs rebelled in six votes, government majority cut to 25 in worst case. Risk to government: moderate. Tuesday: smoking clauses of health bill Issue: replacement of policy for keeping smoking in bars which do not serve food and private clubs with smoking ban in all clubs and bars. Last rebellion: none, but government pre-empted one by promising free vote on options. Risk to government: high. Wednesday: terror bill Issue: ban on glorification of terrorism. House of Lords substituted the weaker phrase of \"indirect incitement to terrorism\". Last rebellion: November 2 2005. Goverment majority cut to one.Support wide-ranging, including ex-ministers Kate Hoey, Clare Short, Jim Cousins, Peter Kilfoyle.
