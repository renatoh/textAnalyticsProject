Then he threw the national curriculum after them. It was just a bit of drama, of course, and he had to retrieve them all after the staff training day was over. Otherwise Ofsted, who visited last month and found the school improving fast, would have had very stern things to say. Haworth was trying to illustrate his view that our knowledge-driven, exam-focused education system does not cater adequately for the needs of the fast-developing adolescent brains of the pupils he teaches. \"Our national agenda is really knowledge-driven,\" he says. \"I want to put that to one side, to make young people confident learners so they can come at problems and offer solutions to them.\" Siding with science Teachers in the UK have expressed this frustration for years. But now Haworth and his colleagues are spurred on by the knowledge that science is on their side. A new report from a major international research project has issued a challenge to the content-heavy, exam-based orthodoxy that has dominated UK education. The report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is the result of nine years' work by neuroscientists. Using new magnetic resonance imaging technology, scientists can watch the physical processes by which we learn. \"At neural network level it's now possible to observe much better than it was before, so, for instance, we can document different sorts of learning processes by measuring the blood flow in the brain,\" says Bruno della Chiesa, leader of the Learning Sciences and Brain Research project. So we now know, for example, that dyslexia is frequently associated with atypical features in the left side of the brain, and that children are born with a pre-wired ability to become numerate. In the future, it may be possible to use brain-imaging to map windows of opportunity, when people's brains are particularly receptive to different types of knowledge - language or numeracy, for example. We also know that our brains continue to develop for much longer than previously thought. But the biggest message is that our education system is not necessarily offering children what their developing brains need. We know for certain what good teachers have often said: learning is more profound when it is active rather than passive, and that is that it is vital for education to be tailored to individual pupils' needs. Learning for its own sake \"Every education system on the planet is driven by exams, assessment and so forth,\" della Chiesa says. \"But what we know from our research is that the way our exams are conducted is not brain-friendly, because the brain just doesn't store information that is learned the night before in order for it to be spat out in an exam.\" The other key message, he says, is that motivation and a positive attitude are crucial for learning - it is now possible to measure how fear and discomfort can impair a child's ability to learn. It is also possible to see the different neural circuits the brain uses for \"extrinsic\" learning - which is motivated by a concrete goal such as a good mark - and \"intrinsic\" learning, which brings its own reward. Haworth is trying to put some of this into practice. In a series of non-curriculum days for years seven, eight and nine, the schools pupils have been given projects that are aimed at allowing them to develop this intrinsic ability to enjoy learning for its own sake. The exercises also build up their analytical and problem-solving skills as well as encouraging teamwork. One was a Pirates of the Caribbean day, where pupils were \"stranded\" on an island. They had to earn gold coins by solving a series of maths-related problems, and buy materials to help them escape. Grace Gill, 13, was one of the participants. It worked well for her, she said. \"Because you were doing it, rather than just listening, you remembered what you learned more than if you were just in a classroom, being told.\" The exercise had wider social benefits too, she added: \"At one point, I did find it difficult because there were two people in my group who were quite disruptive. But we gave them jobs to do and said just to try their best, and in the end they really enjoyed it. And it was good because they sort of saw us as geeks before, but because of this they realised we could work well together.\" Our Lady's initiative came after Haworth attended a course organised by the 21st Century Learning Initiative, which aims to help teachers understand how children's brains develop. The organisation has worked with the OECD researchers. Schools in the area were encouraged to get involved by Mick Waters, who was then chief education officer for the City of Manchester. An enthusiast for active learning, he is now spreading the word as director of curriculum for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. He does not see why national curriculum content should inhibit schools from taking on board the messages of the OECD research. \"It's true to say there are many schools which feel inhibited by the chequered flag of key stage results and GCSE exams,\" he said. \"But they do know education is about going beyond that and seeing what children will be doing in 10 or 15 years' time. Instead of stretching children to fit the curriculum, how do you make the exam system wrap around the children?\" Science or tradition He said the QCA was working to encourage schools to see education as more than just targets. \"I understand the dilemma, but over the last couple of years we have done a lot of work with schools, talking to them about how to engage with the bigger picture. One of our problems in education is that we constantly have to balance our images of traditional success with the possibilities in our evolving knowledge of scientific development,\" he said. But the president of the 21st Century Learning Initiative, John Abbott, a former secondary head, is less upbeat about the level of freedom schools have to make use of this emerging science of the brain. \"What we have got is whole generations of people helping children to pass exams,\" he said. \"But to really fire children's imaginations you need teachers who don't give them answers but give them questions. There's a dictum in primary education: when a child asks a really good question, don't answer it. Give them the information to work it out, so they can think: 'By God, I've got it!' That's how the brain works.\" \u00b7 Understanding the Brain: The Birth of a Learning Science is published by the OECD.
