Sunderland's manager was not impressed to learn that the Republic of Ireland international had infuriated both his team-mates and the national coach, Giovanni Trapattoni, by lashing out at the latter's decision to leave him on the substitutes' bench during his country's 2-1 World Cup qualifying win in Kazakhstan last week. McClean's decision to express his disappointment through expletive-laden tweets was followed by a sincere apology but O'Neill had stern words with the winger when he returned to Sunderland on Thursday. The former Derry City player was told that, at 23 years old, the time had come to grasp the meaning of responsibility. \"James has been acting rather strangely,\" said O'Neill, who is expected to fine McClean for breaching the club's rules on use of social networking sites before suggesting that he also removes himself from Facebook. \"It's good when the player not only wants to play but he also wants to manage the team as well,\" added Sunderland's manager. \"James is rather young for that at the moment. I think Mr Trapattoni has got a couple of years on him and a couple of titles, too. I think he's entitled to pick the team. \"James has even admitted himself he has been rather foolish. He has taken himself off Twitter but he might have a situation with Facebook as well. He has a bit of a problem and we will have to rectify it. Not only that but some of his language [on Twitter] was pretty poor and we will have to deal with that. \"James has got to learn about his choice of language, he can't be swearing on these things. He should have a bit more sense \u2013 and he has to abide by the set of rules we have here.\" McClean previously incurred O'Neill's anger after some inflammatory tweets about his decision to represent the Republic rather than Northern Ireland. \"James has got a lot to really learn,\" said Sunderland's manager. \"He has got to temper everything and he has got to rein in, he really has to rein in. He has to show some responsibility now.\" By way of rounding off a bad start to September, McClean failed the theory section of his driving test on Wednesday. \"He has obviously been affected,\" said O'Neill, who plucked the young Irishman from Sunderland's reserves last December and watched him proceed to terrify Premier League defenders. \"James has failed his theory as well. He's having a tough time but he must just settle down. He has a really good career in front of him. \"It's been a pretty meteoric rise, from Christmas time, on the pitch for him and James has had very few setbacks. He's not had injuries, which I wouldn't wish on him, but that means he has not had to do any fighting really, so his appreciation of things will be less than that of some players. \"That will definitely come and for all the things I have said about him he is sensible enough to start to realise this is a great game we are in and he has a great chance. He has to settle down.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
