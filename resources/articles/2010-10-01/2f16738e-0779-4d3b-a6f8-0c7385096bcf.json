No surrender from the management of the London Fire Brigade. And so here we are, hurtling towards the walk-out that will see fire crews taking industrial action from 1 November, including bonfire night. Everyone looks to Brian Coleman, the ebullient chair of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, to bring his leadership to bear. Thus far it's not going very well. Why don't you meet and sort it out, 9am tomorrow morning, said Channel 4's Jon Snow, seeking to mediate between Coleman and the FBU's Matt Wrack. \"I'll meet tonight,\" scoffed Coleman, insisting he was not exceeding his powers. They talked some more and decided on the morning: 9am arrived; Coleman didn't. It was never his remit to negotiate, the authority says. Of course the replacement private crews hired by Coleman's authority from AssetCo were initially called into action last Saturday, when some complained of harassment and intimidation from strikers. Tensions are high. No doubt some incidents took place. But striking crews wonder if any complaints came from the AssetCo crew who, they claim, needed help connecting a hose while dealing with an incident in east London. And, they say, help in finding the hydrant. And what, says the union, about the AssetCo people who needed our help breaking into a property during an emergency call later in the day? Have they been complaining? The authority says the strikers exaggerate their contributions. Here's hoping. \u2022 For this is a big break for AssetCo, which has long voiced ambitions to make deals with other fire services around the country. A big result for AssetCo boss John Shannon, who is known to have developed a good relationship with Brian Coleman. Prior to the authority and AssetCo striking the \u00a312m contract, Shannon sent Coleman a hamper. Thrice he bought the chairman dinner. By contrast, the official register shows that all Coleman received from the FBU was a complimentary book on firefighting in the blitz. \u2022 Yes, there's a harsh new world out there, and the changes at the Department for Education are coming thick and fast. There are updated signs in reception with the latest name, (who even remembers the Department for Children, Schools and Families), and the pink chairs are now a memory, replaced by sober black. And the television monitors usually show Rupert Murdoch's Sky News, instead of BBC News 24, which was favoured before the election. Strange, that. Hard to explain it. Tough times for everyone, but still the world turns and still people remain determined to travel to all four corners of it. So there will be little by way of belt-tightening as more than 100 tourism ministers make their way to London for the World Travel Market, on 8 November. Such is the lure of a speech by our tourism minister John Penrose. But it may also have something to do with the lavish banquet scheduled to take place in the crypt of St Paul's. It's being laid on by the Madrid-based super-quango, the World Tourism Organisation, an agency of the UN. There's a lot to talk about. And ministers have gotta eat. More fly-on-the-wall footage reaches us from Hastings jobcentre, where managers struggling to cope in the Con-Dem world have removed the toilet brushes from staff bathrooms \u2013 apparently on grounds of cost. Faced with any problems arising from the change of protocol, they now must call Trillium, the private company that owns and manages most of DWP's infrastructure and which received around \u00a37bn for its services last year. They'll send an operative right away. These things are best left to specialists. And finally, everyone loves to be liked, but is maverick, outspoken Tory Roger Helmer failing to pick up on a barely concealed message? \"Just received a small gift from the Czech embassy,\" tweeted the MEP for the East Midlands. \"Chocolates, plus a uranium pellet. Honest. They have a nuclear programme.\" Oh Roger. Have you never heard of Alexander Litvinenko? Don't eat the chocolates. And put the wretched pellet somewhere safe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
