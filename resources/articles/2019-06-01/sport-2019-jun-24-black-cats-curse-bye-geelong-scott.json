For the AFL, there is nothing as quixotic as the Curse of the Bambino, the \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d in Boston Red Sox folklore, when then owner Harry Frazee traded Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees after the 1918 season to finance a Broadway musical. Nor is there anything as exotic as the curse placed on the Socceroos after they failed to pay an African witch doctor for services rendered during the 1970 World Cup qualifiers. The closest the AFL comes is the Norm Smith Curse, originating from when Smith was sacked in 1965, a year after Melbourne won their 12th (and last) VFL flag. Ron Barassi, who defected from Melbourne to Carlton in 1964, is in the minutes as saying that the Demons have never fully recovered from it. Although we did briefly enjoy the Kennett Curse, which lasted a mere five years after the Hawthorn president went on the ABC\u2019s Offsiders after the Hawks upset win in the 2008 grand final and said: \u201cWhat they don\u2019t have, I think, is the quality of some of our players; they don\u2019t have the psychological drive we have. We\u2019ve beaten Geelong when it matters.\u201d But the Kennett Curse is something of a misnomer, when you consider the context of \u201cwhen it matters\u201d, with the only game of consequence in the Hawks\u2019 11-game losing streak being the 2011 qualifying final, before the \u201ccurse\u201d ended with a win in the 2013 preliminary final. But is a sporting curse nothing more than post hoc ergo propter hoc \u2013 an excuse pulled from the figment of our collective imagination to reconcile an intolerable truth? In his essay \u201cOf Superstition and Enthusiasm\u201d the 18th century philosopher David Hume suggests superstitious beliefs are the manifestation of feeble-minded people. In a world where Channel 7\u2019s Roaming Brian is celebrated, where Fox Footy\u2019s Bounce celebrates 350 episodes and in an intellectual climate that rewards \u201csatirist\u201d Titus O\u2019Reily a comparison with the late John Clarke, you suspect Hume would hardly be surprised that the Curse of the Bye is a thing, following Geelong\u2019s upset loss to Port Adelaide on Saturday night, having lost the previous seven instalments of coming off the bye. Geelong coach Chris Scott however, believes it is real. \u201cWhat we have got is a problem in the moment, post-bye,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things we have looked at, it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re ignoring it - it\u2019s a fact \u2026 How relevant it is to the rest of our season is another question (but) it won\u2019t stop us being forensic in our analysis of it.\u201d In terms of forensics, Scott was probably closer to the mark when he said the Cats were \u201cjust beaten by a better team tonight\u201d. And Port Adelaide \u2013 who doubled-down at the selection table (granted, not the best term to use in AFL circles at this time) and dropped Paddy Ryder, Justin Westhoff and Sam Powell-Pepper \u2013 were by far the better team, more than their 11-point win suggests. Playing as a stand-alone ruckman, Scott Lycett played his best game for the Power, with 41 hit-outs to go alongside 24 possessions (18 of them contested). \u201cIt was good to see Scotty play the way he played as a ruckman, but our plan all year was to have one ruckman and another one who can play forward and chop out in the ruck, and tonight that was Dougal (Howard),\u201d said Port Adelaide coach, Ken Hinkley. Howard also \u201cchopped out\u201d with an off-the-ball right jab to the breadbasket of Cats veteran Harry Taylor. But where Geelong really got cursed was winning the hard ball. Port Adelaide had 36 more contested possessions than their highly rated opponents and won the stoppage clearances 41-28 (and overall clearances 52-36). Between them, Robbie Gray, Travis Boak and Lycett combined for more than a quarter of the Power\u2019s contested possessions and more than half of their clearances. Tall shutdown defender and Alipate Carlile legatee Tom Clurey didn\u2019t post big numbers but was every bit as impressive in keeping Geelong\u2019s Tom Hawkins\u2019 goalless. Saturday night\u2019s win at the Adelaide Oval \u2013 after a month that has seen them play in Launceston, China and Perth \u2013 moves Port Adelaide back into the top eight with a 7-6 record and the belief that they can match it with any team in the competition. They also have Charlie Dixon, who played his first game for the year after breaking his leg in last year\u2019s round 21 loss to West Coast. Cats fans will hardly be upset though, they\u2019re still sitting a game (and significant percentage) clear at the top of the ladder. Besides, the only curse you need to worry about in today\u2019s AFL is the imbecilic one that\u2019ll have a behavioural awareness officer eject you from Marvel Stadium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
