Capable of little more exertion that putting the kettle on during the ad breaks in Today with Des and Mel, the clich\u00e9 shows less interest than an Anfield crowd. And, like watching Liverpool, just uttering the words can trigger a mysterious involuntary yawn reflex. So imagine the Fiver's surprise this morning when the Battle of Britain leapt up from the sofa and careered around the sitting room with its arms outstretched a la Jan-Aage Fjortoft, singing the theme from the Dambusters! Why, it must mean that Celtic are playing Liverpool in the quarter-finals of Euro Vase! After his team bored Auxerre to sleep in the Cradle of Dreams last night, Gerard Houllier now has the chance to pit his entire wit against his future successor (probably) Martin O'Neill. Ged was too excited at the prospect to speak today so he left Liverpool's record scorer in Europe Mickey Owen to do it for him. \"A tie against Celtic is a dream for us,\" sighed Mick. \"I remember playing there when I was 17 in 1997, I scored and I will remember that game for the rest of my life,\" he remembered, the minutest details just spilling non-stop from his memory. \"I hope we can experience that atmosphere again.\" Celtic skipper Paul Lambert is just as caught up in the excitement. \"The quarter-final is there now and we have another round to go before the final,\" he said, displaying a perfect understanding of the rudiments of cup competition. \"We haven't won anything - all we've done is made it really exciting,\" he added with creditable conviction. \"It's a magic game and it will be great. It's an exciting time for the club,\" he said, before turning to Owen and adding pointedly, \"and we are still involved in everything going.\" Ach, did he have to rub it in? * * * * * * * * * * * * SURPRISE, SURPRISE: A FERGIE RANT It was a day like any other at Manchester United's Cliff complex, but for Sir Alex Ferguson 1998 was about to take a turn for the worst. Tucking into his breakfast - gruel, cold - Fergie caught sight of David Beckham's new limited-edition, top-of-the-range, bling-bling Bentley pulling into view. The big boss watched as a length of ruby red shag pile rolled out from the back door and the future captain of England stepped imperiously into view. And that's when Fergie rubbed his ageing eyes in disbelief, for there, in the cold light of day, stood his prize asset in what appeared to be a skirt! And a floral-print skirt at that! \"It's a saronnnng!\" whined Dave, as Fergie craned his neck for closer inspection. But his mind was already made up and this merely confirmed what he'd known all along: Londoners are just a bunch of flash buggers. All of them. Today, finally, after holding his purple tongue for too long, Fergie has finally been able to let the world know how he feels. Asked to contribute to Sky One's fawning tribute to the stars of the Premiership - this week starring Teddy Sheringham - Ferguson forgot he owed the ferret-faced forward a debt of gratitude for saving his Big Cup bacon in Barcelona, and instead launched a scathing attack on the good people of London Tahn. \"The Londoners are different, you know,\" he harrumphed. \"I think it's something in the water down there, so at times Sheringham can be a little bit flash. I think it's the make-up of the London people, to be honest.\" Once Sheringham swapped London for Manchester, however, he was cured. Just as the Guvnor' had been. \"Incey was a bit flash, too, but once he got settled in he was all right.\" Let's be honest, Dave Becks was a sitting duck for Fergie to blast. Husband to a pin-thin pop princess and father to several moronically-monikered offspring, Becks has sold his soul to Hellokay!! and buddied up with celebs like Elton John and some bloke named Dolce. The latter being a designer, rather than Joe, that tetchy Italian pop star. \"Beckham's a Londoner,\" reasoned Fergie, sparking up a ciggie stub he'd found on the sole of his shoe. \"He's a bit flash at times.\" If it wasn't such a touchy subject, the Fiver would suggest Fergie knocks his big shot down a peg or two, Govan style. But it is, so we won't. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It was quite embarrassing putting the players on so late because I thought there was still 15 minutes to go\" - Hibernian boss Bobby Williamson on his attempt to alter the outcome of a 3-0 defeat at Dundee, by introducing substitutes Freddy Arpinon and Derek Townsley with ten seconds of the match left. * * * * * * * * * * * * ANOTHER CLASSIC EARWORM \"What about the theme from Animal Hospital?\" Ed * * * * * * * * * * * * TALKING HORSES This Sunday's meeting at the Millennium Racecourse in Cardiff sees the 43rd running of the League Cup, and the two entrants are being put through their paces in preparation for the big race. Ruud van Nistelrooy has been out on the gallops and has returned to the stables with a lovely healthy shine on his coat, while The Amazing Mr Em has been rewarded with a nosebag full of sugarcubes after managing to canter for a whole furlong without sliding along on his teeth. Ruud's trainer, Sir Alex Ferguson, is supremely confident of seeing his horse cross the finishing line in front. So confident, in fact, that he's likely to make wholesale changes to the way he deployed his stable boys during the week. \"In the end, Roy Keane could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on it was so easy for him in central defence,\" said Ferguson, making references to a game against Juventus which we're frankly struggling to crowbar into our laboured equine analogy. But despite this glowing form guide, Ferguson is likely to ask Mikael Silvestre and John O'Shea to do all the sweeping up come the day of the big race. But while Ferguson is the picture of contentment, Mr Em's owner Gerard Houllier has troubles of the mind. Ruddy-faced stable-hand Stephane Henchoz, who always handles himself well on the big occasion, has fitness concerns and may have to take some time off. There's also bad news regarding Vladimir Smicer and Djimi Traore; they're fit and raring to be involved. None of this has unduly affected the market, though, with Ruud currently 10-11f to romp home and Mr Em 11-4 (odds supplied by M Owen Turf Accountants). * * * * * * * * * * * * RUMOURS Despite offering to take a pay-cut to secure a new deal, Steffen Freund is no longer wanted by Spurs. Southampton, Charlton and Everton have been alerted to the availability of the-player-signed-from-Peterborough-who's-not-Simon-Davies: Matthew Etherington. Tomas Repka has pleaded with Paolo Di Canio to kiss and make up with Glenn Roeder, or at least say sorry. If he doesn't, Celtic or Portsmouth may give him a new home. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Graeme Souness claims he would not be upset should Blackburn fail to qualify for the Euro Vase next season, claiming his team have suffered enough through cavorting with the Big Cup's weaker cousin. \"We have suffered this year from being in the [Euro Vase] and getting to the semi-finals of the Worthington Cup,\" he moaned. Ashley Cole is set to be out of action for six weeks following an operation - ruling him out of England's Euro 2004 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Turkey. Charlton manager Alan Curbishley's reward for taking the Addicks to sixth in the table is the shiny Barclaycard Manager of the Month gong for February. Reading defender John Mackie has been banned for three matches and fined \u00a31,500 by the FA after admitting making racist remarks to Sheffield United striker Carl Asaba in a match last December. Rangers manager Alex McLeish has insisted that banning self-styled love machine Lorenzo Amoruso for four matches for spitting on Ayr United's James Grady would be an unjust punishment. \"We will back Lorenzo to the hilt on that,\" he said. \"He is a big player for Rangers. Any punishment imposed would hurt the club rather than Lorenzo.\" Rir Sobby Bobson plans to give Jonathan Woodgate his debut in Saturday's game against Chelsea. \"He is ready, without a doubt, mentally, physically, clinically,\" Bobson said, emphatically. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV 1: World Football (4pm) Given that we sit around and mope all day about our own problems, it's a little rich of us to expect to be able to solve yours. Still, after a week's intensive counselling, we thought we could sign off both Karma Steve and Warehouse Steve. But we were wrong. Sky Sports 1: Soccer AM's All Sports Show (6pm &amp; 2am) So it's a good job that Nicholas Harteley from Perth, Australia, is on hand to help. Warehouse Steve, you will recall, was being woken up with the dawn horn, so to speak. \"Can I suggest that you campaign for a change in the law?\" says Nicholas. The Full SP (7pm &amp; 3.30am) \"It may sound a bit far fetched, but over here we have Federal (Australia wide) regulations that state that your vehicle must be equipped with a horn, and state (Western Australian) regulations that prohibit you from using it. Which may sound like madness, but it makes for quiet streets.\" Live Football League (7.30pm) His advice for Karma Steve is somewhat more practical. Readers, he's offering a new life in a new land! \"I am a recruitment consultant and I could probably find Steve a job out here. Premier League Preview Show (3am) \"That way, providing he is happy to drive a V8 ute, earn lots of money, call everyone mate, and have sunglasses permanently attached to his head he could probably find himself an 18-year-old Holly Valance look-a-like who 'wasn't just interested in his money'.\" Sky Sports 2: Soccer AM's All Sports Show (12am) \"I am not sure that this would restore his karma, but she might look better than his last girlfriend, and being used to Australian men, may not work out how poor a boyfriend he is, thereby removing any chance that she might dump him whilst he is in a meeting.\" Problems solved! Football League (3.30am) So now, something for the weekend. Tom Bird says: \"My wife and I are selling our house. I have since realised that this is a pain in the backside and should be avoided at all costs. However I now find myself in a small, but annoyingly unavoidable, predicament. BBC Radio 5 Live: Sport On Five with Ian Payne (7pm) \"Every Saturday my wife insists on both of us cleaning the house incessantly from top to bottom, in the vain hope that this will increase the chances of us selling the house. As Mike (our lodger) and I have tried to explain to her, no one buys a house on the basis of how clean it is, but she always pulls out the line that 'women do', and that as Mike and I are not women (we're definitely not), we are wrong. Talksport: Football First (7pm) \"Up until last week I had managed to avoid these little Saturday morning chores by playing golf with my mates. This was working fine, until last week when I ruptured some muscle in my forearm. (Yes, playing golf, before you get smutty.) So now what? Am I doomed to a life of domestic hell?\" Newstalk 106: Off The Ball With Ger Gilroy (7pm) Well, readers? You heard the man. All he wants to do is play golf and let his missus do all the work. Is that so wrong? Send us your solutions, and if you have pressing problems of your own, then Dear Fiver is here to help and the.boss@theguardian.com s your sounding board."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
