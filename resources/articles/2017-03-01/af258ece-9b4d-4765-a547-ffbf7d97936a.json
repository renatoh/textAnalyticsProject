You can read the match report here or check out Kevin Mitchell\u2019s comment below. \u201cWhat can I say? This has been a fairytale week once again,\u201d Federer says. \u201cI came here for the first time 17 years ago. To be the champion again, I can\u2019t tell you what it means to me.\u201d \u201cI would like to congratulate Roger,\u201d a tearful Wawrinka says. \u201cHe\u2019s laughing, he\u2019s an asshole but it\u2019s OK.\u201d Fighting back tears, Wawrinka adds: \u201cI\u2019ve lost some tough ones against you, but when you played the final in Australia, I was your biggest fan. So congratulations on your comeback and congratulations on today.\u201d Roger Federer\u2019s dream season continues. He\u2019s now beaten Wawrinka for the Indian Wells title to move to 13-1 on the year and 6-0 against oppoents in the top 10. That\u2019s his best showing to start the year since 2004 when he went 18-0 and finished No1. Second set: Wawrinka 4-6, 5-7 Federer At 15-love, Wawrinka nets a shot from the baseline for 15-all. He sends Federer scampering from end to end on the next point with a series of angles shots before Federer errs, but Wawrinka misfires on the next point for 30-all and now Federer is within two points of the title. Federer is all over Wawrinka\u2019s serve but Stan muscles his way back into the rally and wins the point for 40-30. But now Wawrinka sends a forehand from the baseline sailing for deuce. And now Wawrinka dumps a backhand into the net and Federer has a championship point! The crowd swells and then quiets. Wawrinka\u2019s serve graces the netcord: let, first service. Then a fault. Fed jumpes on a second serve, sends Wawrinka scampering and closes out the point with a routine volley winner! Second set: *Wawrinka 4-6, 5-6 Federer (*denotes next server) At 30-love, Federer nets a backhand early in a baseline rally. Wawrinka then pounces on a second serve and forces Federer into an error from the baseline for 30-all. A chance here for Stan? Federer faults and he\u2019ll have a big opportunity on a second serve at 30-all. But Federer dials in a service winner and wins the next point to hold for 6-5. Now Wawrinka will serve to force a tiebreak while Federer will try to break to win the title. Second set: Wawrinka 4-6, 5-5 Federer* (*denotes next server) At 15-love, a lovely backhand winner followed by an ace makes it 40-love. That\u2019s 10 consecutive points on Wawrinka\u2019s serve. Federer answers with a forehand winner followed by a double fault which Wawrinka challenges unsuccessfully, but a service winner gives Stan the hold. Second set: *Wawrinka 4-6, 4-5 Federer (*denotes next server) Three quick points for Federer and followed by an angled winner off a serve-and-volley to cap a love hold in just over a minute. Now Wawrinka will serve to stay in the match. Second set: Wawrinka 4-6, 4-4 Federer* (*denotes next server) Wawrinka answers with an easy hold of his own. We\u2019re moving right along here: 18 games played in just over one hour. Second set: *Wawrinka 4-6, 3-4 Federer (*denotes next server) Another routine service game for Federer. Both players are serving well, but the difference between the countrymen is on second-serve points. Federer is 23 of 30 on the first serve (77%) compared to 23 of 31 for Wawrinka (74%); but he\u2019s 11 of 17 on second serve (65%) compared to 8 of 22 for Stan (36%). Second set: Wawrinka 4-6, 3-3 Federer* (*denotes next server) At 40-15, Wawrinka overcooks a forehand from the baseline. Then Federer hits a winner for deuce and suddenly the first Hugely Important Point of the match is upon us. A service break here would no doubt put Federer within touching distance of the title. Wawrinka alleviates the tension with a thunderous ace, then follows it up with a service winner for the crucial hold. Second set: *Wawrinka 4-6, 2-3 Federer (*denotes next server) Wawrinka with a glimmer of a chance as Federer falls behind 15-30 after his first double fault of the match. But he rattles off two quick points before pushing Wawrinka nearly off the court with a blistering second serve and winning the point easily for the hold. So much for that. The break consolidated, Wawrinka will serve at 2-3. Second set: Wawrinka 4-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes next server) Wawrinka quickly falls behind love-30 and Federer has a half-chance here to move level. Wawrinka mistimes his approach but Federer dumps his passing shot into the net for 15-30. A gift for Stan as Federer had all the room in the world to set up triple break point. Nevertheless, Federer wins the next point and will have two looks at a break point. He needs only one, passing Wawrinka with a forehand for the break to get back on serve in the second. Second set: *Wawrinka 4-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes next server) At love-15, a gorgeous touch volley winner by Federer, who is now 8-of-10 on net approaches (compared to 0-of-1 for Wawrinka). I mean, seriously. He then rattles off three quick points for a drama-free hold and he\u2019s on the board in the second set. Second set: Wawrinka 4-6, 2-0* Federer (*denotes next server) At 40-30, a backhand gets away from Wawrinka and Federer has taken it to deuce. What a crushing blow if Stan fails to consolidate the break here. A backhand winner by Federer paints the baseline and now he will have a chance to break right back. Wawrinka sends a shot from the baseline long and appears to have been broken ... but he challenges it and it was in! Deuce. Now another winner by Federer on a net approach and he\u2019ll have a second look at a break point. A divine volley from Federer, but Wawrinka attacks Federer\u2019s backhand on the next point and saves it for deuce. Federer goes for a cross-court forehand winner but misses by inches and Wawrinka wins the next point for the hard-won hold to back up the break. This is high-level stuff from two top operators, perhaps the two finest hard-court players in the sport at this moment in time. Second set: Wawrinka 4-6, *1-0 Federer (*denotes next server) What a start for Wawrinka, who wins the first three points on Federer\u2019s serve and now has three break-point chances. At love-40, this is only the second break point that Federer has faced in the entire tournament. He saves the first, then the second when he wrong-foots Wawrinka from the baseline. But he sends a backhand from the baseline long and after 42 consecutive holds of serve at Indian Wells, Federer has finally been broken. What a recovery for Wawrinka after being broken to end the first set. First set: Wawrinka 4-6 Federer Federer wins a point to put Wawrinka in a love-15 hole, but Stan answers with an ace out wide \u2013 his third of the afternoon \u2013 for 15-all. Wawrinka hits a winner for 30-15, but Federer gets the best of a baseline rally for 30-all and he\u2019s two points from the set. Interesting. Wawrinka appeared to hit an ace but opted not to challenge it. Wawrinka goes long on a running forehand from the baseline and Federer has his first break-point chance of the day \u2013 and it\u2019s a set point. Then Wawrinka sends another forehand long from the baseline on the longest rally of the match and he\u2019s broken to lose the first set! \u201cIt\u2019s dumbfounding why Stan wouldn\u2019t challenge that when he had three challenges left in such a huge moment,\u201d Patrick McEnroe says in the booth, noting that Federer appeared to gesture that the ball was in. \u201cCould it be that he has too much respect for Roger Federer?\u201d First set: *Wawrinka 4-5 Federer (*denotes next server) Wawrinka gets it to 30-all for the first glimmer of hope on Federer\u2019s serve, but it\u2019s quickly denied as Federer wins two quick points. Now Wawrinka will serve to stay in the first set. First set: Wawrinka 4-4 Federer* (*denotes next server) At 15-love, Wawrinka delivers a beautifully placed flip lob on an approach to win a point. What a gorgeously wrought shot. He then rattles off two quick points for the love hold. First set: *Wawrinka 3-4 Federer (*denotes next server) Another love hold for Federer, who continues to push the lightning-quick pace. He\u2019s lost only two points on his serve, none on his second serve. First set: Wawrinka 3-3 Federer* (*denotes next server) Another easy hold for Wawrinka, who\u2019s dealing on his serve \u2013 albeit far better on the first serve (9 of 10) than second (3 of 8). First set: *Wawrinka 2-3 Federer (*denotes next server) A third straight crisp service game for Federer, who\u2019s now won 12 of 14 points on his serve. Five games in 12 minutes has set quite a pace for this final. First set: Wawrinka 2-2 Federer* (*denotes next server) A stress-free hold for Wawrinka, who survived that tricky end of the court serving into the setting sun with no apparent distress. He\u2019s been made to work a bit harder on his service games but no moments of real danger yet. First set: *Wawrinka 1-2 Federer (*denotes next server) Another immaculate service game from Federer: a love hold in barely over a minute capped by his first ace of the match. He\u2019s won eight of nine points on his serve and now the pressure is on Wawrinka once more. First set: Wawrinka 1-1 Federer* (*denotes next server) At 30-all, Wawrinka dials in a 134mph ace down the middle, then follows with a 137mph serve that Federer can\u2019t return in play. First set: *Wawrinka 0-1 Federer (*denotes next server) A breeze of a service game for Federer, who sprints ahead to a 40-love lead after a serve-and-volley on the opening point. He loses a point on an unforced but closes it out on the next point. Two picturesque backhand winners in the game. Remember: he has not been broken yet in this tournament and has faced just one break point. The conditions on court: 94F with a 6mph breeze. Not much longer now. Federer has won the coin toss and elects to serve. The players are warming up now and should be under way within the next few minutes. The players have emerged from the tunnel and are on the court. Federer noted during the on-camera interview with ESPN\u2019s Brad Gilbert that it\u2019s only the second time he\u2019s met Wawrinka in a final and he\u2019s yet to beat his countryman at this stage of a tournament. That\u2019s a generous way to cast his 19-3 advantage in the all-time head-to-head, but no less honest. Elena Vesnina has just finished off Svetlana Kuznetsova for the women\u2019s title. On 8 February of last year, she was ranked No122. Tomorrow, she will move to a career-high No13. Federer and Wawrinka will be on court imminently and we\u2019ll be under way shortly. At last! Here\u2019s a look at the statistics for both Federer and Wawrinka at Indian Wells entering the final. (Stats in italics indicate tournament leader.)

Which means we\u2019re at least 40 minutes away from the men\u2019s final. Some more odds and ends, courtesy of the ATP\u2019s crack media relations staff: Federer is trying to win his fifth Indian Wells title (to move level with Djokovic for most ever), 25th Masters 1000 championship and 90th overall title in his career He won titles here in 2004-06 and 2012 and reached the final in 2014-15 At 35, Federer is trying to become the oldest player to win a Masters 1000 title; Andre Agassi was 34yrs, 3mos when he won in Cincinnati in 2004 Federer\u2019s last Masters 1000 title came in Cincinnati in 2015, two weeks after he turned 34. He won that tournament without getting broken once in 49 service games. He\u2019s held all 37 service games at this tournament so far, facing only one break point (against Nadal in the fourth round) He is 12-1 on the season, including 5-0 against opponents ranked in the top 10. That\u2019s his best showing to start the year since 2004 when he went 18-0 and finished No1 Federer will move from No10 to no worse than No7 in Monday\u2019s rankings; he\u2019ll climb to No6 if he wins today Federer owns a 19-3 advantage in the head-to-head series with Wawrinka, including a commanding 14-0 edge on hard courts. He won their most recent meeting in a five-set Australian Open semi-final in January and their two previous meetings at Indian Wells in the 2011 quarters and 2013 fourth round. Wawrinka\u2019s lone win over Federer in a final came in the 2014 Monte-Carlo Masters. Three of the Big Four \u2013 all but Murray \u2013 have accounted for 12 of the past 13 Indian Wells title. The lone exception? When Ivan Ljubicic, who currently is Federer\u2019s coach, won the title in 2010. Hello and welcome to the Indian Wells final between Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer. Today\u2019s all-Swiss showdown marks the first final between two countrymen at the Masters event since Andre Agassi defeated Pete Sampras in 2001. The third-seeded Wawrinka is playing in his first final at the Palm Springs tournament, while the ninth-seeded Federer enters the seventh final of his career here without having dropped a set or even lost a service game. This is the oldest combined final in tournament history between Federer (35yrs 7mos) and Wawrinka (31yrs 11mos) \u2013 and the winner will become the oldest champion in tournament history by surpassing Jimmy Connors, who was 31yrs, 5mos when he won here in 1984. Bryan will be here shortly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
