Rishi Sunak said the prime minister was \u201cengaging positively\u201d with medical staff as he gave an update on Johnson\u2019s condition at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. He said Johnson was receiving \u201cexcellent care\u201d, adding: \u201cThe latest from the hospital is the prime minister remains in intensive care where his condition is improving. \u201cI can also tell you that he has been sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team. \u201cThe prime minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend, and my thoughts are with him and his family.\u201d Sunak was later pressed on whether Johnson had received enough medical support while he was unwell, and if it was true he was only told to go to hospital following a Zoom call with his GP on Sunday. The chancellor said: \u201cI think the prime minister has received excellent care and advice at every step of the process. At the end of the day, we are all trying our best, none of us are superhuman and impervious to getting sick during this process and that\u2019s what makes this thing so awful ... as I\u2019ve observed and seen, the care has been excellent.\u201d He said politicians and officials had been \u201cdoing their best to follow the guidelines\u201d following concerns that high numbers of those working on the coronavirus response in Westminster have been struck down with the disease. Insisting the government was still functioning well, he said: \u201cThere is a good update on the prime minister\u2019s condition and those who have been away many are now returning to work. But whether people are away or social distancing or in the same place, the business of government throughout all of this has gone on at pace.\u201d Johnson has been in St Thomas\u2019 hospital since Sunday night, when he was first admitted to the care of a team led by the respiratory expert Dr Richard Leach. He was moved to intensive care on Monday night after his condition deteriorated. No 10 said he had not been placed on a ventilator at any point and did not have pneumonia. They did not reveal further details, such as whether Johnson had any type of secondary infection. The prime minister was said to be \u201cresponding to treatment\u201d in an update on Wednesday lunchtime. No 10 has been receiving medical updates from doctors at St Thomas\u2019 but Johnson is now not doing any work at all. He was working on his red box of government papers even after being admitted to hospital, up until when he was admitted to intensive care. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said he was able to be in contact with No 10 if necessary. However, he has not spoken to Dominic Raab, who is deputising for him, since going into hospital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
