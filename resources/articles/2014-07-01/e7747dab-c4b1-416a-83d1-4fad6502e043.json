He has admitted, though, that the Croatia defender could become the latest player to leave St Mary\u2019s this summer. Southampton\u2019s new manager was determined to quell the uncertainty surrounding the club after the sales of Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert to Liverpool and Luke Shaw to Manchester United and is determined not to see his newly inherited squad ripped apart. Lovren last week said his head was already at Anfield and expressed anger that Southampton have rejected Liverpool\u2019s \u00a320m bid for him. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in Holland that the young players don\u2019t have the patience to wait for a bigger club,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of football. They had a great season and they play wonderful games. I know Liverpool got a lot of money now after the [Su\u00e1rez] transfer and normally they will spend that money and they will buy some players and maybe they will buy one player of Southampton. \u201cOK, that\u2019s a normal question. But as a manager of Southampton I have to do everything to keep the best players. Again the final decision is of the board of the club.\u201d Koeman, who has signed Dusan Tadic from FC Twente as a replacement for Lallana, is confident of completing an \u00a38m deal for the Feyenoord striker Graziano Pelle but he was displeased with Lovren for speaking out. He has ordered the 25-year-old to join the squad on Sunday for their tour of Belgium and has planned further talks with him. \u201cI spoke to Les Reed [Southampton\u2019s director of football] and two times to Dejan,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cHe was very clear. I said I want to keep Dejan in the team. I respect all the meanings but we have to do what the best is for the club. \u201cHe has a contract, he has to come back this Sunday but I don\u2019t know what will happen after this. First of all we like to keep all that info in the club, not the press. That was not a good thing of his side. You like to have all the players happy; happy to be at Southampton. If there is a different opinion, we will speak about that and make a decision. \u201cI hope he will come back. He has to come back on Sunday. Four or five days ago he said it\u2019s a difficult situation and he will have another talk to the club and his agent but he knows he has to come back because he is still a player of Southampton.\u201d Koeman maintained Southampton were not a selling club and said that the \u00a357m recouped for Lallana, Lambert and Shaw should be enough. However Lovren is intent on leaving and Morgan Schneiderlin is a target for Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cThat\u2019s the situation,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cWe are not a selling club. The players have contracts. We don\u2019t sell any more players and we will keep to that. But we know what happens in football. We sold three players. That\u2019s good enough. Enough money. Now we will keep the rest. \u201cThat\u2019s true, you want all the players happy and wanting to play. But if someone is unhappy, they can come to me and we talk. First we have to keep these players. That\u2019s the job of the board. There is money to keep the quality and to bring new players in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
