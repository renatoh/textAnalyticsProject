Age Concern was publishing a report - Penalised for being ill - in which it claims to expose the \"hardship\" that older people suffer under current social security rules. Director General Gordon Lishman said the state pension for a single person is cut by \u00a328.30 a week for a hospital stay of six weeks or longer. He said: \"Older people who have paid a lifetime of contributions are shocked to discover the basic state pension comes with this small print at a time when they are sick. \"It is high time for these outmoded and unjust rules to go. Hospital down-rating must be abolished if the Government is to meet its commitments to giving pensioners a better deal.\" At any one time, more than 30,000 sick older people are enduring cuts to their pension and sometimes other benefits, he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
