My leaving was in no way health related.\" Yet, if the 56-year-old's departure from Liverpool is not a direct result of the acute aortic dissection which necessitated major heart surgery in October 2001, the downturn in his reign on Merseyside may stem from that trauma. Running on the emotion of their manager's return to the dug-out, Houllier's side had finished second and reached the Champions League quarter-finals that season. The downturn since has been dramatic. An assessment of where Houllier's reign on Merseyside stuttered and stalled will always return to the fateful summer of 2002. Back then, the Frenchman was adjusting to a very different life after his illness. His intensity was dimmed, but he still knew this was an opportunity to consolidate a second-place finish in the league, the club's highest position since 1991. There were players available with whom to take that next step. Blackburn officials had privately admitted that they would be in no position to resist a bid of around \u00a312m for their precocious Irish winger Damien Duff, the man to add width and whip to Liverpool's play. Ajax's creative fulcrum Rafael van der Vaart was available, if for an apparently inflated \u00a38m. Houllier and his board were aware of both yet the manager baulked at the valuations. El Hadji Diouf, Bruno Cheyrou and Salif Diao arrived for a combined \u00a318m and Liverpool lost ground. That decision still haunts Anfield. Where Liverpool needed to add players who made the difference, they bought inadequate squad members and the initiative was lost. The subsequent desire to re-define the team's style merely suggested his recuperation had offered him too much time to think. The judgment that year was poor yet, in many ways, Houllier was already a changed man. His initial success in re-invigorating an ailing club had been achieved through tireless work. Whether it was scouting, coaching, promoting or researching, the Frenchman was immersed in all things Liverpool, flanked by the trusted Patrice Bergues. The latter's departure back to Lens in the summer of 2001 was a blow, though working around the clock was also taking its toll on Houllier. That summer he attended the Confederations Cup in Japan and went on a pre-season tour of Thailand. In hindsight, he admits he felt the strain that unremitting workload was putting on his body and mind, culminating in the illness which almost cost him his life later that year. Ever since his return to the dug-out, his focus has changed. That is not to say that Houllier can no longer achieve successes elsewhere. But, when Liverpool had to take the biggest step of all to become challengers, he was still adjusting to a new everyday life. The key footballing decisions he made backfired. Failure, of course, is always relative. \"People will look at his time as a golden period for the club,\" said Jamie Carragher back in February. Two seasons of under-achievement instinctively taints the memory, but history will remember G\u00e9rard Houllier's reign in a kinder light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
