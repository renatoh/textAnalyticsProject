The national chief correspondent Hedley Thomas, media columnist Mark Day and then media editor Darren Davidson all contributed to the pile-on, which amounted to no fewer than seven articles undermining The Bribe Factory. In his first story, \u201cExtortionist calls shots for Fairfax\u201d, Thomas praised the scoop but mused that the story exposed the \u201cpotential moral hazard for journalists and media outlets\u201d in using leaked emails from sources who may be extortionists themselves. Thomas\u2019s report was based on information from a London-based public relations firm, Tancredi, hired by Unaoil. Tancredi\u2019s operatives were so pleased with the Thomas story they sent it to media outlets, including the BBC, according to emails seen by Beast. Unaoil, through the Australian lawyer Rebekah Giles from Kennedys, bombarded Fairfax with legal threats. Giles claimed the Fairfax story was based on a source who may have been involved in a criminal enterprise to extort millions from the Ahsani family. In the media section, Davidson reported Fairfax was going to be sued for injurious falsehood and damages that could reach \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d. Day found another line of attack, writing that the story was boring and no one would read it. \u201cI doubt that more than 1 per cent of Fairfax\u2019s readers cared more than a tinker\u2019s cuss about the story,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt that the oil bribery story put on a single extra sale for the SMH or Age print editions.\u201d While Baker and McKenzie held the line, the attacks from the Oz planted seeds of doubt in the Fairfax executive about the safety of the story. It may have taken three years, but McKenzie and Baker were vindicated this week when the Ahsanis pleaded guilty to bribery charges involving multi-million-dollar corruption across nine countries over 17 years. Thomas told Beast his stories were not attacks on the scoop but a fresh angle on a complex story. \u201cAs far as I could discern back then, the Age had a riveting series about a family business which appeared rife with corruption,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI had an interesting and untold side story about a strange extortionist who may well have been playing both sides of the fence. I wish I\u2019d had the Age\u2019s original story \u2013 and now they\u2019ve been completely vindicated. Great result.\u201d But McKenzie and Baker see the Oz coverage a little differently. They told Beast it was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d that some Australian journalists had attacked their story. Bevan\u2019s beef The ABC\u2019s Matt Bevan was also unhappy with the Australian this week, after it published a letter which he said alleged he sympathised with terrorists. The letter, referring to Bevan\u2019s reporting on RN\u2019s Breakfast program about the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, said \u201cthe national broadcaster sides with those who seek to harm our Christian way of life\u201d. Bevan told Beast he would not be pursuing the matter further. Tragic tale A story that dominated parts of Melbourne\u2019s media for several weeks came to a tragic end on Monday, when 23-year-old court clerk Ashleigh Petrie died after being hit by a car in the early hours of the morning. Petrie found herself in the spotlight after the Herald Sun published an exclusive story about her engagement to a 68-year-old magistrate, Rodney Higgins. The Herald Sun reported on 9 October that an email had been sent out warning staff about inappropriate relationships with judicial officers, and that complaints had been made on the Sale and Bairnsdale court circuit about Petrie regularly entering Higgins\u2019s chambers and trying to use his reserved car space. The story also used extensive quotes and numerous pictures from Petrie\u2019s social media accounts illustrating the couple\u2019s romance. The Daily Mail, Channel Seven Melbourne and the Age all followed up the story over several days.

The Herald Sun editor, Damon Johnston, wrote to staff in a herogram about reporter Shannon Deery\u2019s work on 11 October, after the paper had run two front-page stories, two page-five leads, a page-three lead and multiple online reports. \u201cChief court reporter Shannon Deery reminded us all this week about the importance of owning a round,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe online reports attracted 93,000 subscriber page views and 30 [subscriptions]. To put that into perspective, a story is considered a digital success if it gets 2,500 page views or 1 sub.\u201d The paper kept up its coverage, reporting that the opposition had written to the Judicial Commission of Victoria, asking it to investigate Higgins\u2019s suitability. Columnists jumped in to criticise the age gap. \u201cI can\u2019t help thinking Petrie is trading off having an older partner with physical or social limitations in exchange for a certain lifestyle,\u201d Susie O\u2019Brien wrote. The day before Petrie\u2019s death, the Age repeated some of the more salacious details reported by its rival. Johnston told Beast the Herald Sun was saddened by Petrie\u2019s death and \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d were with her family and friends. \u201cRegarding your inquiries, early last month, several senior legal figures and sources within Victoria\u2019s magistrates\u2019 court system raised concerns with the Herald Sun about the relationship between magistrate Rodney Higgins and clerk Ms Petrie,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe paper was told that there were concerns among lawyers and court staff [which] had been raised with chief magistrate Peter Lauritsen, citing a perceived power imbalance between the pair.\u201d All quiet at the rock When we heard the Australian Financial Review editor, Michael Stutchbury, had taken time off work to fly to the Northern Territory to climb Uluru, we can\u2019t say we were surprised. But we did call to ask the 62-year-old about it. Stutchbury told Beast he did plan to climb the rock a few weeks ago with one of his sons but when they arrived at the base it was closed. \u201cI am one of the quiet Australians,\u201d he said. Killing season It\u2019s that time of year when shows get axed and stars get dropped and this week was no exception. Macquarie Media announced its sports radio stations in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane would be \u201cpaused and reviewed\u201d \u2013 a bizarre term which reminded us of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin\u2019s 2014 announcement that they would \u201cconsciously uncouple\u201d. SBS and NITV announced the Marngrook Footy Show had been axed, prompting Marngrook founder and producer Grant Hansen to say it was a \u201creally crazy decision\u201d. But it was the departure of Fox Sports reporter Neroli Meadows that shocked fans and the media industry alike. Meadows was a popular presenter on Fox Footy, where she hosted On The Mark and AFL Tonight. After 10 years with Fox Sports, Meadows was blindsided to be told her contract would not be renewed. Foxtel\u2019s chief executive, Patrick Delaney, told MediaWeek that Foxtel had a good record on promoting and hiring women, but would not be drawn on the details. Meadows was a rare beast on Fox Sports because not only was she a woman but she was a journalist who conducted masterful interviews with sports stars. \u201cWe have plenty of women on the network and from time to time people go,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have jobs for life.\u201d But it\u2019s not all bad news for some media personalities. As we tipped in September, the Australian\u2019s NSW political editor, Andrew Clennell, is joining Sky News as political editor, following the departure of David Speers for the ABC. Kieran Gilbert has been promoted to chief news anchor. Goodbye to Sky Another victim of the killing season is Sky News\u2019s executive producer of talk, Greg Byrnes, the man who was responsible for putting the far-right extremist Blair Cottrell on air last year. Byrnes was pulled into a meeting with human resources manager Lynette Jones and Sky News boss Mark Calvert. Sources say Byrnes was given more than a year\u2019s pay and told his role had been restructured. Byrnes lasted just over a year after he approved Cottrell\u2019s appearance for a one-on-one discussion about immigration with presenter Adam Giles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
