Certainly do not give him mouth-to-mouth after retrieving him with a broom handle. If you do, you might leave DNA in his mouth, have it connected to an unsolved murder and end up on the run. Such a fate befalls some poor woman who comes to Boyd and the gang's attention along with a charred cadaver, a dental assistant, a living fossil and single-nucleotide polymorphism. Am I Normal? 9pm, BBC2 Gordon Brown's favourite clinical psychologist, Dr Tanya Byron, investigates whether addiction is illness or a choice. While some shouty American author is in no doubt that it's the latter - and addicts are weak and self-indulgent - others to whom the poised Byron speaks suggest otherwise, - and they have evidence to back it. Or at least lots of brain scans. Here, Byron also questions if behaviours, such as shopping, can become addictive like substances, such as heroin, and examines unorthodox treatments that may rid addicts of their cravings. The Fixer 9pm, ITV1 After starting with such promise, The Fixer hasn't quite lived up to it. In essence, it's the same story every week: Lenny issues order to Mercer, Mercer scowls, Callum clowns, Rose does her washing up and Mercer's sister appears, grinning like a ninny. As the series concludes with an underwhelming story devoid of any tension, Mercer at least manages to crack a smile while the baddie-of-the-week snarls sayings such as: \"The world is corrupt and violent. The human race feeds on itself.\" Someone hasn't had their coffee this morning. Quest for the Lost Ark 9pm, Channel 4 Just as the existence of extra-terrestrial life is unlikely to be revealed exclusively by Horizon, so the discovery of the Ark of the Covenant will probably be announced with a bit more fanfare than a Channel 4 documentary. Don't tell Tudor Parfitt, though. Having traipsed the world and scoured ancient tomes, the writer and academic is convinced that he has found the legendary artefact. \"If I'm right, it will change everything anyone has ever believed about the fabled lost Ark of the Covenant.\" Big if, that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
