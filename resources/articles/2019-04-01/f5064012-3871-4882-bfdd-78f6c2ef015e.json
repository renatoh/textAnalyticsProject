The Xbox One S All-Digital Edition is functionally and visually identical to the existing Xbox One S console, apart from the absence of a disc drive. It\u2019s aimed at \u201cdigital natives\u201d, according to Microsoft\u2019s Jeff Gattis \u2013 primarily teens who grew up without the discs and cartridges that older games relied upon. It is out on 7 May, and will cost \u00a3199 in the UK and $249 in the US, significantly cheaper than the other Xbox One models. It will come with Minecraft, Forza Horizon 3 and Sea of Thieves pre-installed on it s1TB hard drive, and a discounted subscription to Xbox Game Pass, which offers a library of more than 100 games for a monthly fee. The disc-less model is not intended to replace disc-based Xbox Ones, Gattis insists, despite a huge market shift towards subscription services and downloadable games in the past few years. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to push customers toward digital; it\u2019s about meeting the needs of customers that are digital natives that prefer digital-based media,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not able to talk about future generations [of Xbox consoles]: for now this is a choice that buyers can make, and the market can take things where it wants to take it.\u201d The Xbox One S Digital-Only Edition is only the second video game console to rely entirely on game downloads instead of discs or cartridges: the first was Sony\u2019s portable PSP Go, released in 2009. Microsoft has been working on a next-generation Xbox console for some years now, and is widely expected to announce it at this year\u2019s E3 video game expo in June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
