But despite warning before the match that \u201cthey want us to fail\u201d, this time there was no repetition of the events that marred their previous game here, with both sets of players standing arm-in-arm before kick-off in a welcome show of solidarity against racism. After a week during which Millwall\u2019s reputation has once more been placed in the dock, there was a real sense of relief as applause rather than booing broke out among the 2,000 supporters \u2013 a feeling that returned later when the substitute Jon Bodvarsson\u2019s equaliser rescued a point for Gary Rowett\u2019s side after Ilias Chair\u2019s stunning goal for Queens Park Rangers. \u201cThey responded to the message that we were trying to portray, which is what we all want,\u201d Rowett said. \u201cNone of us want racism or discrimination in society and football is a very powerful tool for trying to fight it. \u201cWhat we tried to do today was almost create a line between the knee being the only gesture and another form of a gesture, which the fans got behind. I\u2019m sure that there were people looking on in the football world who were hoping that there was more negativity but I\u2019m proud of the club and the fans for at least trying to make this a positive thing. I hear a lot of statements and comments but what we haven\u2019t seen is enough action from the authorities about this.\u201d Rowett\u2019s QPR counterpart, Mark Warburton, said: \u201cMillwall deserve a lot of credit.\u201d The fallout from the defeat by Derby on Saturday led to the anti\u2011racism charity Kick it Out\u2019s logo replacing Millwall\u2019s usual shirt sponsor for the evening, as well as the joint gesture with their opponents before the start. The club have also launched their own initiative called United for Change and underlined the importance of this match in an email that was sent to all supporters in attendance describing it as \u201cone of the most important days in Millwall\u2019s history\u201d. The email read: \u201cThe eyes of the world are on this football club tonight \u2013 your club \u2013 and they want us to fail. Together as one, we will not let that happen.\u201d Aside from one small section at the front of the Barry Kitchener stand who were quickly drowned out by applause and heckles of \u201cshut up\u201d when several of QPR\u2019s players took a knee, thankfully they did not let them down. Many of those who were present on Saturday were again in attendance, with the club having prioritised tickets on a rotation basis for around 2,800 who paid for their season tickets in advance back in March. One who did not want to be named suggested that the crowd\u2019s reaction before the game against Derby had not been about players taking the knee and blamed it on Colin Kazim-Richards\u2019 decision to raise his fist in a black power salute. \u201cThat\u2019s what kicked it off,\u201d he said. Millwall\u2019s Mahlon Romeo \u2013 the son of Soul II Soul\u2019s Jazzie B \u2013 heavily criticised fans for their reaction, saying he felt \u201cpersonally disrespected\u201d. But having led the home side out instead of the captain, Alex Pearce, he was one of the best performers in the first half, along the right flank as they enjoyed the majority of possession but failed to take advantage. Mason Bennett\u2019s cross 10 minutes before the interval was the closest Millwall came to breaking the deadlock but Jed Wallace could not quite stretch far enough to get the vital touch, while the referee waved away appeals for a penalty after Shaun Hutchinson went down in the box \u2013 much to the annoyance of the home fans. Their mood was not improved eight minutes into the second half, when Chair took aim from outside the box and curled an exquisite shot into the net to give QPR the lead, with the Moroccan and Bright Osayi-Samuel both taking a knee and raising their fists in celebration. The Scotland striker Lyndon Dykes should have made it 2-0 soon afterwards but his shot was well saved by Bartosz Bialkowski and the Poland goalkeeper had to be at his best to deny both Osayi-Samuel and Dominic Ball. They would regret spurning those chances as Bodvarsson \u2013 one of three substitutes thrown on by Rowett with almost half an hour still to play \u2013 equalised with a heavily deflected shot. Matt Smith, who joined Millwall last summer from QPR, looked the player most likely to find a winning goal as both teams pressed forward late on. But on an occasion like this, a draw felt like the most appropriate result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
