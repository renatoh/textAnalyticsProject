Set 349 to win after a sloppy performance in the opening innings, centuries from Joe Root (107) and Jos Buttler (103) were not enough to get England over the line as Sarfaraz Ahmed\u2019s side ended a run of 11 straight defeats and sent their passionate supporters into raptures. Morgan\u2019s pre-tournament favourites next meet a dangerous Bangladesh side in Cardiff on Saturday with one win and one defeat to show for their efforts so far. The captain said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was that bad a day but fielding-wise it was. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from one of our best performances [against South Africa] to, not extremely bad, but one that has cost us maybe 20 runs and that is a lot in one-day cricket. \u201cFielding is an attitude thing. It\u2019s a matter of taking our stand-off attitude today and getting it back to our positive attitude where we go for everything and create that fearless nature.\u201d While for England it represented their first unsuccessful run chase on home soil since September 2015, Pakistan\u2019s victory once again underlined their mercurial nature after a hammering by West Indies in their opener on Friday. Mohammad Hafeez, named man of the match after top-scoring for his side with 84 and claiming a wicket with his off-breaks, said: \u201cWe were all very confident. We practised yesterday very well and we had a good meeting together. It\u2019s a total team effort, I believe. We all know the capabilities we have and we believe in that.\u201d There were stoppages during the doomed run chase as both Root and Buttler spoke to the umpires about the condition of the ball. England had been warned about throwing the ball into the ground during Pakistan\u2019s innings and Morgan claimed the pair were simply checking the same standards were being applied. Morgan said: \u201cJos was just intrigued to see the ball. When the ball is hit against the LED [advertising] boards it does scuff it up quite a lot so he was just interested to see if one side was rougher than the other, natural or unnatural.\u201d Root added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get involved. If I go into it I will say something that will get me into trouble.\u201d Despite that coy response, Root was forthcoming about the tournament situation. \u201cMaybe we had left ourselves a little bit too much to do at the back end, but the most important thing now for us as a group is not to panic. \u201cThe temptation is to get a little bit tense, but one of our great strengths as a side is sticking to the way we go about things and be as smart as possible. \u201cAnd the beauty of this format is that I do believe the best four teams over the tournament will qualify for the semi-finals and we\u2019ve got to make sure we play some good cricket in our remaining games. \u201cOne thing this side doesn\u2019t do very often is make the same mistake twice and I\u2019m sure the guys will make sure it\u2019s a very different performance against Bangladesh.\u201d Morgan meanwhile was confident he will escape censure for a slow over-rate, despite the first innings ending 19 minutes after the cut-off point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
