The man was wading across a waterway near Palumpa, a Daly river region community about 370km south-west of Darwin, when he was attacked by the two-metre animal. CareFlight Top End said the man had been treated at the Palumpa medical clinic for bites to the chest and arm before he was flown to Darwin in a stable condition. \u201cCareFlight\u2019s doctor and nurse provided further treatment and ongoing care in the helicopter,\u201d it said. The Daly river region has a high concentration of crocodiles. In 2015, when flooding forced the mass evacuation of some communities, crocodiles were reportedly seen swimming around town, and had been rumoured to have taken a couple of dogs. In January a man was killed by a 3.5-metre crocodile at the notorious Cahill\u2019s Crossing causeway between Kakadu national park and Arnhem Land. Northern Territory police said the 47-year-old man had been attempting to wade across the flooded causeway \u2013 which was open only for high-clearance four-wheel-drives \u2013 when he was attacked. In October, rangers and traditional owners called for greater safety measures at Cahill\u2019s Crossing after a woman was filmed shooing away a four-metre crocodile with her thong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
