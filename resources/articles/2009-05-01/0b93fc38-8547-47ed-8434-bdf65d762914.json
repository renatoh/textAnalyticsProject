They won the grand slam in the Six Nations, they set a world-record crowd for a game below international level \u2013 82,208 \u2013 when Munster and Leinster met at Croke Park in the Heineken Cup semi-final, and they filled more places in the original Lions squad, including the post of captain, than any other country. All it needs now is for Leinster to rise to one more occasion, the Heineken Cup final on Saturday at Murrayfield, and Ireland's time will be complete. Almost. Paul O'Connell could yet lead the tourists to a series win in South Africa. First things first. Leinster, the dames of the game, the Dublin pretty boys, have hardened up. Three years ago they danced all over Toulouse away, only to be crushed by Munster in the next round. Not just crushed in one act; back and forth went Munster over a team flattened into Rizla paper. This season, Leinster exacted a spectacular revenge, fronting up and giving Munster a taste, and then some, of their own mincemeat. And then they ran them off their feet. This was revenge with a twist and a flourish. This was Leo Cullen rising to the occasion in the second row against Lions elect, Brian O'Driscoll rising higher than anyone in the European game, and props like Cian Healy and Stan Wright preparing the base for the age beyond O'Driscoll. This could have been a one-off, an inspired uprising against their tormentors. But Leinster had already revealed a steely core in their 6-5 victory away at Harlequins in the quarter-final. This was a serious workout for the defence that will have to hold firm against the Leicester Tigers at Murrayfield. Part of high-tensile Leinster has been imported. Rocky Elsom has brought some unflinching Australian irreverence to the back row, the perfect complement to the athletic Jamie Heaslip at No8 and Shane Jennings, a No7 who rediscovered his best form when it mattered against Munster. Most of it is home-grown, the culmination of career-long missions by O'Driscoll, Gordon D'Arcy, Shane Horgan, Girvan Dempsey and Malcolm O'Kelly. Then there is the new, the stellar Luke Fitzgerald and the tyro Johnny Sexton, who came on to replace Felipe Contepomi in the semi and seized his chance ravenously. Leinster look confident, well balanced and driven to succeed. This final business is novel, but they seem to be approaching their latest showdown without trepidation. Ireland's season could reach its glorious conclusion on Saturday. And yet. It was not the fault of the eastern quarter of the country that Tom\u00e1s O'Leary was injured, or that Alan Quinlan had a moment of madness \u2013 a decade spent etching a reputation and prising an opening for himself ruined in the instant it took to scrape a hand across Cullen's face \u2013 but Munster's woes are dents in the Irish cycle. Fellow Irishmen, Leinster, delivered the blows but the exposure of all of Munster's Lions \u2013 more than from any other single club, region or province \u2013 as human suggests that rugby may not be quite so Irish after all. On the day, for example, when Ireland were scrapping to an enthralling victory over Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to seal the grand slam, England were setting about Scotland at Twickenham and prompting their manager, Martin Johnson, to make the observation that not many teams would fancy playing his team now. England had lumbered into the Six Nations but were sprinting across the line. And so it is with Johnson's old club, Leicester. For much of the season they have been good but not special. Now they are very tasty, liberated by their coach, Richard Cockerill, and his assistants, Paul Burke and Matt O'Connor and busy to the end of the season, with two grand finals. Michael Cheika, coach of Leinster, has been forced, by injury to Contepomi, to give Sexton his break. Cockerill took the disgruntled journeyman Sam Vesty and gave him licence to run the team. Vesty has been immense, wide of vision, accurate in execution and strong on the break. He posed more questions in one semi against Bath than Leicester as a team mustered between September and Christmas. Julien Dupuy and Aaron Mauger, the French scrum-half and the Kiwi centre, were fired by the example of their outside-half. Geordan Murphy too at full-back, his personal re-ignition coinciding with the captaincy being handed to him. Ben Woods, Craig Newby and Jordan Crane may be more predictable than Leinster's back row, but as slaves to directness they supplement the front five rather than support the outside backs. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with the Tigers pack. Ben Kay is back to his form of six years ago at the lineout, while Martin Castrogiovanni and Marco Ayerza seem to take particular pleasure in grinding the life out of opposing props. Then there is Tom Croft in the second row. If the back row go head-down for contact Croft offers something imaginative in front of them. It is said he may not be hard as teak in the swampier areas of play but when you can run and jump as fast and as high as Croft you can skim over pond-life. To reach this point, Leicester have spread their wings. To their grit they have added sparkle. Leinster have taken the sandpaper to their gloss and come up with a more matt finish. Two teams with so many letters in common have drawn together in style. Far from cancelling each other out, the similarities could produce a storm of invention, a final to remember, with Leicester contributing to the view that England, not Ireland, are finishing the season in style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
