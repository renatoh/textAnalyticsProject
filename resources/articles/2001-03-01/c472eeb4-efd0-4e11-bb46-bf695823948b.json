Business and the travelling public are crying out for a clean, reliable and above all safe underground system. They deserve to have it now - they've waited long enough - but instead they stand by helplessly, forced to await the outcome of seemingly endless political machinations. You may be surprised - but I don't blame the government. It has bent so far backwards to accommodate the London mayor that it is in danger of somersaulting. The concessions: a special share with veto rights over the way the infrastructure companies operate; the right to approve their key staff; and the ability to change the way in which they do their work. The companies bidding to transform the tube are probably already wondering why they should take all the financial risks when so much of their operational flexibility and management control is being taken away - and who can blame them? Government, despite the obvious risks of undermining any future public-private financing projects, wants to get a deal done quickly. But despite the extensive concessions that the government appears to be able to live with, the mayor's office still asks for more. We are not impervious to the rhetoric, but if there really is a better way than PPP, why has the mayor's office singularly failed to come forward with a detailed workable alternative capable of immediate implementation at no risk to the UK taxpayer? Like it or not, PPP has been designed specifically to bring about the huge investment programme that the underground so desperately needs, coupling private money to private sector know-how and project management. It will deliver more than \u00a313bn of new investment and maintenance. And the private finance will provide an upfront injection of cash, so customers will start to see improvements very quickly. CBI headquarters is actually over the tube at Tottenham Court Road. Anyone who has struggled to gain access to the Central or Northern lines during rush hour can have no doubt that safety must be paramount. PPP puts safety first. The government has already agreed to underwrite any new spending needed to upgrade safety. And its independent watchdog, under the leadership of Bill Callaghan, will oversee the safety improvement programme. The tube will continue to be publicly owned and run but the PPP transfers risk of cost overruns to the private sector. It may be painful to admit, but the public sector does not have a great track record when it comes to delivering large infrastructure projects on time and to budget. The dome is a perfect illustration but perhaps more relevant is the Jubilee line extension. There were numerous cost overruns and the taxpayers picked up the bill. Under PPP private sector companies would use their management skills and expertise to prevent delays and overruns - if they didn't they would have to pay the price. It is a powerful incentive that shouldn't be underestimated; nor should it be undermined by the giving away of so much management control. I don't want to stand on the sidelines while the tube continues to deteriorate. Another two years of overcrowded, unreliable and dirty trains is just not acceptable to business and not fair to Londoners. Cancelling the PPP would set back improvements by at least that time; London deserves better - and how long would its reputation as the world's number one financial centre last if the PPP collapses and the transport situation goes from bad to worse? Frankfurt and New York are already knock ing on the door and would be delighted to take our place. We have already spent too long on negotiations, which have failed to deliver. What business and passengers really care about now is getting the job done - and quickly. PPPs can and do work, and with the right contract details we will all benefit from safer, more comfortable and reliable travel. Imagine a London transport system as good as anywhere in Europe, with better trains, new stations, new signalling and track. If the government moves to preferred bidder status without further delay it could soon be the reality. I spend much of my time banging the drum for British businesses overseas, telling foreign governments just how good British businesses are. In the last few months I have been in Prague, Poland, Chile and India where dis cussions on British involvement in massive infrastructure projects were at the top of the agenda. What messages must our domestic wrangle on this key transport issue send to those and other countries on the verge of engaging British expertise? We have a lead on the rest of the world in this area - do we really want to see that sacrificed on the altar of politics? I am not interested in hidden political agendas. All I ask is that, in the interests of everyone who takes pride in our capital city, something has to be done now. The government has gone far enough - too far in the eyes of many. It is time to see if the mayor really puts London first. Digby Jones is director-general of the CBI. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
