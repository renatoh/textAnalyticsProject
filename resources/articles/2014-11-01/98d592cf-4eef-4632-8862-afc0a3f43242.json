Just under 4% of backroom staff positions, including the roles of physiotherapist, goalkeeping coach, technical director, under-21s manager and academy director, were filled by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) employees when the PFA took its most recent snapshot of the game early last year. As the Football League prepares to commence its review on Thursday into the under-representation of BAME managers and coaches, the PFA\u2019s research suggests that the problem is more far-reaching than acknowledged. The snapshot, covering the Premier League and Football League, has been sent to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the PFA will make the full research public in due course. The FA board member Heather Rabbatts said the governing body is drawing up plans for a talent identification programme to bring BAME coaches into the Club England setup and provide increased opportunities for mentoring and professional development. While almost 30% of players in the top four divisions are BAME, just 2% of managers \u2013 Chris Powell at Huddersfield and Keith Curle at Carlisle \u2013 are from such backgrounds, despite BAME candidates making up 18% of those taking coaching courses . \u201cThe refrain I hear from black coaches is: \u2018We\u2019ve got the qualifications but we can\u2019t get the experience,\u2019\u201d said Rabbatts. \u201cI\u2019m working on how we can develop a scheme for supporting black coaches within the Club England structure, and I hope to be able to say more about that in the very near future.\u201d The FA\u2019s chairman, Greg Dyke, has publicly backed a call for the Rooney rule but the governing body has yet to embrace such an initiative actively. Rabbatts believes that providing opportunity within the St George\u2019s Park setup will make a difference. \u201cIt\u2019s giving them the experience of on the job training. We\u2019ll be making further announcements shortly but it\u2019s clearly an important part of what the FA can do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
