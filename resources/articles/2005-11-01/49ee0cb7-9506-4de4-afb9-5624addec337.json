I had read about its ancient mystical properties and planned to propose to my beloved - a crystal-wearing hippy - at the site. It would cost \u00a315 to get a taxi there from Salisbury and \u00a357 to stay in a local hotel, intriguingly titled a 'Travelodge', that was within walking distance of the monument. I had a vague, romantic idea of the sun setting over a log cabin perched on the downs within sight of Stonehenge. Milly and I would be lying in each other's arms, the ring I'd bought sitting on her finger. Suffice to say, 'walking distance' meant a 45-minute hike alongside a freeway. And the Travelodge was a soulless flytrap for depressed travelling salesmen. Our room, inevitably, was right next to the deafening road. Hoping to salvage something from the situation, I inquired about the possibility of room service while Milly shifted uneasily from one foot to another on the stained, grey carpet. The old hag behind the counter shook her head and muttered something about a 'Little Chef' while pointing to an adjoining building. This restaurant was like Wendy's but six times as expensive and without the charm or class. Still, there was our visit to Stonehenge itself the following day - at least that would make up for everything. We got up early and made our way on foot towards the ruin. After about half an hour it started to rain. The kind of life-sapping rain you only get in the UK. Milly fell over in the mud, and somewhere on the journey lost one of her 'life' crystals. We spent an hour retracing our steps until we'd located it. When we eventually got to the site, things took a turn for the worse. It's just a load of stones between a fork in the road. I mean it's impressive, kind of, but once you've looked at it from six different views there's nothing else to do. I couldn't quite summon the guts to propose next to a freeway while being gawped at by bored tourists. We made our way back to the Travelodge in silence. As soon as we got back to the hotel we had a horrendous argument that was followed by a tortuous dinner. Milly had putrid maple syrup pancakes because she didn't like the vegetarian option, and my burger was so greasy and tasteless I didn't realise I'd eaten most of the fat-drenched napkin it had been resting on. Milly laughed cruelly and said it was the perfect metaphor for our relationship (which, incidentally, I still don't understand). We broke up when we got back to Newark airport a few days later. \u00b7 This is an edited extract from The Idler Book of Crap Holidays, published by Bantam Books (\u00a9 Idle Ltd 2005) \u00b7 Have you had a crap holiday?
