Ski firms said the price difference would be even more noticeable when holidaymakers buy food and drink in resorts. Countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Norway, which are not in the Eurozone, are expected to do well this season. An Inghams spokeswoman said prices in Europe were up to 5 per cent more this winter. Based on an average holiday spend of \u00a3700, that means \u00a335 per person, compared with 4 per cent less in North America. 'We are talking about a 10 per cent difference in the base price, plus it will be a lot cheaper once people are in the North American resorts,' she said. 'There is going to be a bigger growth over that side of the globe this year.' Airtours, which features Canadian resorts, said this year's price drop followed on from lower costs across the Atlantic in the last few years as skiing there becomes more popular - last year, the company had late deals for as little as \u00a3199. 'It is not just the ski resorts that are tipped to do well,' said a spokeswoman. 'Florida is being tipped as an absolute bargain for next summer.' Key dates such as New Year and school holidays are already filling up fast, said Stuart McLeod, managing director of the Specialist Holidays Group, which operates Crystal Holidays and Thomson Ski. 'There's not much left,' he said. He estimated that prices in Europe would be about \u00a330 more than last winter. However, he added that while the weak dollar had made both Canadian and American resorts more affordable, some skiers would still be deterred by the higher cost of flying across the Atlantic. The Canadian resort of Whistler is expected to continue to do well in the next few years, particularly in the run-up to its hosting of the Winter Olympics in 2010. Overall ski bookings for this winter are up 15 per cent, partially due to good snow conditions last season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
