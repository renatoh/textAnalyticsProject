No one was hurt in the collapse in Stratford, east London, at around 5.30pm, but 47 people were evacuated from houses nearby. The homes were left teetering on the edge of the hole. They are built close to where the new Channel Tunnel Rail link is being dug linking Ashford, Kent, with the new terminal at St Pancras. Police closed streets around the site to allow the fire brigade, engineers and safety officers from the local council to get near to inspect. A spokeswoman for the fire brigade said the hole measured 25 metres by 60 metres. The spokeswoman said the structural collapse was to do with the works on the Channel Tunnel but all workers were accounted for and there were no injuries reported. A spokesman for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link project said an investigation into the groundslip was under way. He added that it was too early to say whether the \u00a35.2 billion project, stage two of the rail link, would be delayed by the incident. The tunnel is being dug by a giant boring machine excavating an eight metre diameter hole, working 24 hours a day. The section currently being built runs from Stratford to Ilford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
