At 25 Brook Street lived George Frideric Handel, while the top half of No 23 was the abode of Jimi Hendrix \u2013 an auspicious alignment confirmed by two blue plaques on these adjoining Mayfair houses. Both men had come to a city that swung in their time, and both made a habit of injecting showy virtuosity into familiar formats \u2013 think of all those ornamented arias in Handel's case, or the sexing-up of steady 12-bar blues in Hendrix's Red House. Maybe that is pushing the comparison, but there is no disputing that the two share a certain flamboyance. And thanks to the Hendrix in Britain exhibition at the Handel House museum \u2013 which is opening to mark the 40th anniversary of the guitarist's death \u2013 you now have the chance to wander between Jimi's garish jackets and Handelian harpsichords, and to compare the canopy of Georgian four-posters with the draperies that hung above swinging-60s beds. As part of the commemoration, Jimi's pokey but pricey flat is being briefly opened. That space ordinarily serves as the office for the Handel House, but back in the day it was where Hendrix claimed to have spotted a bewigged man trying to reach him in the mirror. It is best not to ask what he had been smoking, or whether Noel Redding had crept up on him, and revere this as the moment when great neighbours became good friends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
