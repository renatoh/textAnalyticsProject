Three years on, this follow-up is just as remarkable. At first listen the polished production threatens to push Spektor into MOR Katie Melua territory, but her uncanny ability to write melodies that are simultaneously familiar and challenging, coupled with lyrics that are idiosyncratic yet everyday (from an expose of atheism to an aria on a lost wallet) make this a richly rewarding album."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
