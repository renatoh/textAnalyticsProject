Royal and security files; the proceedings of the Profumo inquiry; the Peter Wright \u201cSpycatcher\u201d case; most defence records; Anglo-Irish negotiations; documents on \u201cMark Thatcher and the Omanis\u201d and Soviet relations have all been retained by Downing Street. The reluctance to make material available to researchers and the public at the National Archives in Kew coincides with the transition from a 30-year to a 20-year release rule introduced by Gordon Brown. The last Labour prime minister had declared in 2007: \u201cIt is time to look again at whether historical records can be made available for public inspection much more swiftly than under the current arrangements.\u201d Allowing more recent material to be released may, however, be encouraging the normally retired civil servants who \u201cweed\u201d the files, taking out material still deemed to be excessively sensitive, to adopt a more cautious approach. At the same time release dates of files have become increasingly uncoordinated as Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office documents have been delayed by the need to concentrate on the migrated colonial archives hidden at Hanslope Park in Buckinghamshire. The latest batch of Cabinet Office and Prem (prime minster\u2019s) files mainly cover 1986 to 1988 but many date back further. Among the list of files published by the National Archives, there are 45 containing transcripts of evidence from Lord Denning\u2019s 1963 inquiry into the Profumo affair. They are closed for the somewhat arbitrary period of 84 years and therefore due for release in 2047. There are also 32 Cabinet Office files on the Peter Wright Spycatcher case from 1986 and 1987, most of which are said to be \u201ctemporarily\u201d retained by the department. Files listed as Prime Minister: Cementation contract: Mark Thatcher and the Omanis, Prime Minister: Mark Thatcher and the Omanis: other allegations against Mark Thatcher and Prime Minister: Request by electronic data system to employ Mark Thatcher have all been retained. Also missing from Kew are: Royal Family: Procedures for members of the Royal Family taking up jobs and other commercial appointments; Proposals relating to the papers concerning the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936; Royal Family: Career of Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Visits by the Queen to the security services. Commenting on the Mark Thatcher files, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cA small number of records have been retained because they contain personal data about individuals and sensitive information relating to other countries. This is in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, called for the Mark Thatcher files to be released. He said: \u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant and this decision is ludicrous. If certain sections still compromise national security or foreign relations after all this time, they should be redacted. Given the topic, it seems more likely that this is a move to avoid embarrassment. \u201cThere is no legitimate reason for these papers to not be in the public domain and I urge the Cabinet Office to think again.\u201d A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cThere\u2019s been no change in policy regarding the files that are being retained. Files are being released more regularly. There is always a small number of files that will be withheld in line with the Public Records Act.\u201d That allows material relating to security and other areas to be retained. Nonetheless, some surprises have come to light through papers released to the National Archives in Kew: \u2022 The former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson had proposed visits to the Soviet Union vetoed several times by Thatcher\u2019s administration. In October 1982, Lady Marcia Falkender, his former private secretary, wrote to No 10 asking if he might visit on behalf of the GB-USSR Association, of which he was president. A letter on behalf of the foreign secretary, Francis Pym, discouraged his travel plans on the grounds that it would send a signal that \u201cBritain no longer took so serious a view of [the Soviet] actions in Afghanistan and also of their complicity in the maintenance of martial law in Poland. As you know the government\u2019s policy remains no high level political contacts except where these are deemed particularly advantageous.\u201d Four years later, Wilson ran into different objections when he proposed visiting Russia in late 1986. The Foreign Office informed Downing Street of the plans. The FCO letter objected to the trip because the company involved in hotel construction he was planning to accompany had a poor commercial reputation. The second reason given was that: \u201cLord Wilson\u2019s own failing memory and increasing tendency (demonstrated during his last visit in 1983) to indulge in irrelevant and repetitive reminiscences \u2026 It is rather sad that we should be put in this position which we should much prefer to avoid; but Lord Wilson shows no sign of calling a halt to his overseas travel.\u201d Wilson died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 1995. \u2022 Thatcher\u2019s press secretary, Bernard Ingham, advised the lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, about the dangers of of allowing the media to talk to judges. Writing in March 1988, he explained: \u201cThe issue needs to be handled very carefully indeed because there could scarcely be a worse time for adopting a more liberal approach. The media become more rather than less trivial, sensational, inaccurate and irresponsible. Consequently the attached note is austere. It is, as you will see, based on the belief that judges have far more to lose from familiarity with the media.\u201d \u2022 Thatcher expressed concern in one cold war file in 1988 about the dangers to British pilots if Soviet air defences deployed lasers to blind pilots, noting on one memo: \u201cI hope it has by this time found effective protection?\u201d Charles Powell, her foreign affairs adviser, sent her a reassuring memo informing her that work on protective goggles had been going on since 1982 and laser eye protection would soon be available for RAF air crew. \u2022 Thatcher\u2019s government nearly broke down because so many ministers went off on their travels during her first summer in power. A memo circulated in May 1980 to senior ministers across Whitehall by Clive Whitmore, the principal private secretary at No 10, mingled entreaties with the firm smack of authority. \u201cBefore these [holiday] plans get too advanced,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cthe prime minister has asked me to draw her colleagues\u2019 attention to the need to ensure that government business can continue to be discharged efficiently during the recess. \u201cIt often proved difficult,\u201d he added, \u201cin the summer and early autumn of last year to hold cabinet or main cabinet committee meetings because so many ministers were away from London.\u201d Whenever ministers left the capital and the journey back took more than an hour and a half, they were required to record their absence and contact details on a form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
