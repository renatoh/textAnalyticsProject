It was on 14 March 2002 that the Scot replaced Walter Smith as manager following a 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Middlesbrough and with the club heading for another relegation struggle. Seven years on, and following last Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final victory over Middlesbrough, Everton will have their first experience of Wembley for 14 years against Manchester United in the semi-finals and remain on course to qualify for Europe for a fourth time under the 45-year-old. The turnaround helps explain why Everton made Moyes the highest paid employee in the club's history when he signed a new five-year contract worth \u00a316.9m last October. And he believes there would be greater reward at Goodison had the club the resources to compete with the Champions League regulars. \"If this was back in years gone by and the money was equal, I would see Everton as one of the top clubs,\" said Moyes, who marks his anniversary at home to Stoke City tomorrow . \"The difference why Everton are not one of the top clubs at this moment in time is more to do with finance than the team or the manager. \"I have got to hope we can get it right back where it has been in the past. I don't know if that is possible because finances play such a part in the game. The other clubs have a greater chance to improve their squad by buying bigger players from all over the world. Everyone has made a point about how well the club is doing. It is nice in March but it would be better for me if they were still saying the same things in May.\" Despite the financial frustrations, Moyes credits the backing of the chairman, Bill Kenwright, and the club's board as pivotal to Everton's transformation under his tutelage. And he believes Everton are a model of how to progress as a club without the transfer budgets of the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafael Ben\u00edtez. \"I can say I feel brilliant about seven years in this job, because these days you don't normally get that length of time,\" added Moyes. \"I've enjoyed it. If I were to describe it, I would say it's been slow, steady progress, and that's because I have had the confidence and backing of the people here to put this in place. \"I'm most proud of qualifying for the Champions League, but it is our consistency over the six seasons that pleases me most. In my first full season if we'd won our last game at home then we'd have qualified for the Uefa Cup, and that would have meant Europe four times out of six. \"In my third game we lost at Newcastle 6-2. Bobby Robson said it was my welcome to the Premiership, but since then we have progressed to become a top-six club while they have had I don't know how many managers over that time. \"They know their problems more than me, but I hope what we have achieved here suggests managers should be given more time, that the slapdash approach to appointments doesn't work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
