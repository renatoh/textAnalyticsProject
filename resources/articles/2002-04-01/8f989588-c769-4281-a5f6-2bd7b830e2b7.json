He has been taking legal advice from Michael Beloff QC, who often hears cases on behalf of the Lausanne-based court and believes Baxter will have a good chance of winning back his medal taken away last month. Beloff will probably represent him at the hearing this summer. The IOC disqualified Baxter after he tested positive for the stimulant methamphetamine following his third place in the slalom in Salt Lake City. He claims he was unaware that the American version of a nasal decongestant he used before the race in February contained the substance. \"I'm convinced that the IOC has got this wrong and I am fighting to regain the ranking points and bronze medal I won on merit in Salt Lake,\" Baxter said. He will also restate his call to the IOC to conduct a split analysis, which he hopes will prove the methamphetamine is not the performance- enhancing version of the drug. Baxter's sponsors continue to show sympathy. Peugeot have given him a new 406 Coupe and Drambuie are paying him the bonus he was due in his contract for an Olympic medal. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
