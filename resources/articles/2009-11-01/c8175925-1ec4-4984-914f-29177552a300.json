While there is much to admire about the Russian's precise all-court game, it is virtually impossible to warm to him. He is the wasp at a picnic, the cloud on a sunny day. In a decade he will be forgotten; the man who reached for the grand slam top table but never managed to find a chair. Yet when he rushed through the opening set of his ATP World Tour Finals semi-final against Roger Federer in under half an hour, it suddenly seemed that a major upset was about to unfold. While it took some time for that upset to arrive, it eventually did, with Davydenko winning 6-2, 4-6, 7-5. None of the world's top four players will contest the final with Davydenko meeting Juan-Mart\u00edn Del Potro of Argentina who defeated Sweden's Robin Soderling 6-7, 6-3, 7-6 last night. The Russian could have been excused for beginning the match with a Kremlin-sized inferiority complex having lost all his previous 12 games against the world No1, as well as having had to play the late match on Friday evening, giving him only 15 hours to recover, while Federer had the advantage of an extra day's rest. \"Maybe I start to play better and him not so good,\" said Davydenko after his group stage win over Soderling the previous evening, and it certainly looked that way in the opening set when the Swiss served particularly poorly, and rushed his forehand. An uneasy hush settled over the O2 Arena. But this was Federer; arguably the greatest player ever. Surely the six-times Wimbledon champion was not about to lose. When he won the second set, improving his serve and forehand radically, and finally beginning to move with the power and grace of a champion, there seemed no obvious reason to suppose he would let matters slip again. With a 5-4 lead in the final set he was just two points away from victory, but Davydenko held firm \u2013 just. \"As the match wore on I felt better and better but I just could not get it done, though the level of the match wasn't the greatest,\" said Federer, with just a smidgeon of bad grace. Davydenko was runner-up last year in Shanghai to Novak Djokovic, though even then he was better known for the longest inquiry ever held into match fixing in tennis. He lost to Martin Vassallo Arguello at the Polish Open in Sopot in August 2007, retiring injured at 6-2, 3-6, 1-2 in a second-round match that attracted nearly \u00a33.5m in wagers on Betfair. The ATP cleared Davydenko of any wrongdoing after their investigation found no evidence of a violation, though the Russian's lawyer claimed it cost the player thousands of pounds in lost endorsements. After losing his opening round-robin match against Djokovic he went on to beat Rafael Nadal, and was clearly in excellent form, although he finished his match against the Spaniard limping slightly. There was even talk of him pulling out before his final match against Soderling, which he had to win. \"It was just a tight muscle, nothing really,\" he explained. Federer might have wished to the contrary. This was his chance to win the title for a record-equalling fifth time, placing him alongside Pete Sampras and Ivan Lendl. \"It's disappointing. I missed out at the start again,\" he said. Last year in Shanghai he was dumped out in the round-robin stage by Andy Murray \u2013 the first time in the end-of-season tournament, restricted to the best eight players in the world, that he had failed to reach the semi-finals or better since his debut in 2002. That was when awkward questions began to be asked about his future at the highest level, Federer having been beaten in the final of the French Open and Wimbledon by Nadal last year. These questions were notched up an extra level at the beginning of this year when the Spaniard defeated him again in the Australian Open final. Was this the changing of the guard at the top \u2013 were the new order taking over? The answer was no. Nadal's invincibility on clay fragmented when Federer won the French Open and then, in Nadal's absence, Wimbledon. Earlier this week he sealed the No1 ranking for the fifth time in the past six years. Better not write him off just yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
