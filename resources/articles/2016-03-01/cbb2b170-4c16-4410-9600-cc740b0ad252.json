In the straw poll that traditionally finishes the three-day conservative event \u2013 which is famed as much as a hook-up spot for college kids as it as a measuring stick of the grassroots \u2013 Ted Cruz won with 40%. The Texas senator was followed by Marco Rubio at 30% and Trump with 15%. It did not help that Trump canceled on the event in order to hold a rally in a place that his campaign spelled \u201cWitchita, Kanasas\u201d. The Republican frontrunner objected to taking any questions during his scheduled appearance there. Cruz and Rubio received rapturous receptions from the crowd at CPAC, as the room filled to capacity for their speeches. Cruz in particular was received well, the conservative firebrand being repeatedly interrupted by applause. But he and Rubio were clearly favorites at an event where Donald Trump\u2019s name was booed almost as frequently as Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Kyle Foley, a first-time attendee from Orlando, Florida, was wearing a Rubio sticker. He told the Guardian he \u201creally liked [the Florida senator] as a person. Nothing I blatantly disagree with.\u201d In contrast, he said: \u201cI have every issue with Trump. He\u2019s a liar on basically everything.\u201d As one staffer for a presidential campaign told the Guardian, there were \u201ca lot of Cruz supporters and a lot of Rubio supporters\u201d present while Trump pointedly \u201cdidn\u2019t show up\u201d. But disapproval of Trump wasn\u2019t just based on that. Trump\u2019s appeal on the stump is a rejection of the conservative establishment \u2013 CPAC is the personification of it, or at least those who seek to join it. The event is filled with GOP operatives and college students who aspire to become GOP operatives. Every year, many of the attendees are young Republicans who hope to find their first job out of college or a potential first lady. The conference has a furious and not very furtive singles scene. For these young Republicans, both Cruz and Rubio have appeal. Trump, who exit polls show is disproportionately supported by the older and less educated, is still the candidate of the masses. He may be winning states but among establishment Republicans and those who wish to be establishment Republicans, he has a lot of work to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
