Guardiola\u2019s team are clear favourites to win a third Premier League title, with City and United each having only six matches left. Yet having seen his team lose their previous three games \u2013 away and home to Liverpool in the Champions League, and in the league to United \u2013 the manager cited the example of Real Madrid in 2003\u201104, when they led Valencia by a point but suffered six defeats in the final seven matches to finish fourth in La Liga, behind Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s then side. City are at Tottenham Hotspur for Saturday\u2019s late fixture. A victory, combined with a United defeat against West Brom on Sunday would secure the title but it was put to Guardiola that if City lose and United beat West Bromwich Albion and Bournemouth before his side play again they may start to feel the pressure. In this scenario United would have cut the deficit to seven points having played a match more. Guardiola said: \u201cIt can happen. Football is full of emotions but what we have to try to do is focus and win our games against Tottenham, Swansea and after that the other ones. So we know that. \u201cI am not the most calm, because that is not the right word, but it\u2019s the fact that since November or December [people say] we are already champions \u2013 when I saw the pundits and the people in November, they say it\u2019s already done. The players have shown every day, in every game [since then] that it\u2019s not done, because if it was they wouldn\u2019t play the way they play. \u201cBut in one week we lost three games. That happened. So we have to play tomorrow and after that we see the result from United. But it doesn\u2019t depend on the United result, it\u2019s in our hands, it\u2019s up to us to win our games, and we are able to win [the] two games [needed]. We handled the pressure \u2013 the good, the bad situations \u2013 the whole season.\u201d Regarding how pressure is more intense when trying to seal the title, Guardiola said: \u201cThat will be good for our future, you have to handle that. You have to learn that because, at the end, if we were not able to do it and United win the league, all we can say is \u2018congratulations\u2019 to United, reflect on what we have done badly in the last month and move forward. But in football it can happen.\u201d Guardiola countered any notion that such a scenario is unlikely. \u201cOf course it can happen, I assure you. Real Madrid, years ago, lost six games and didn\u2019t win the league. So of course it can happen, no doubts about that.\u201d He also cited how the Cleveland Cavaliers overturned a 3-1 deficit in the 2016 NBA finals to record a 4-3 victory, the first time that had happened in basketball\u2019s pre-eminent club competition. \u201cThey know that [the players]. It\u2019s not necessary to say it to them. Of course it can happen. In football, in sports. In the NBA finals one team recovered from 3-1 down. Cavaliers won against Golden State Warriors 4-3. They won three games in a row, so in sports, it can always happen. But it\u2019s in our hands, we don\u2019t depend on anyone else, and that\u2019s a good advantage. We have six games. We have to win two, or one and draw two games. If we lose, we\u2019re going to do it in a similar way to the way we played against United and Liverpool. I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re going to do it in that way, and after that we\u2019ll see. \u201cWhen the opponent is good, we will congratulate our opponents on beating us, and after learn from that for the next game.\u201d While Guardiola admitted Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s ability to play again this season is in the balance because of a knee problem, the Spaniard said the 32-year-old David Silva may appear less next year. \u201cNext season, David maybe he will not play every game, that\u2019s why the squad has to be big. David played more because he was absent for a while, due his [ill] son\u2019s situation, that\u2019s why he had maybe more energy in the legs [recently].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
