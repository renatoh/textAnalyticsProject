Until we meet again. Here is Aaron Bower\u2019s match report. Solskjaer: \u201cWe\u2019ve responded well after the Watford one [loss]. \u201cFirst half we laid the foundations and in the second half we defended superbly. \u201cI think Fred has improved a lot. He is a confident and tenacious midfielder.\u201d On Williams: \u201cHe is never fazed, he can go forward, he can defend. You will never be afraid to put someone like Brandon in.\u201d Classic Mourinho ... Goals. Maguire describes it as a \u201cgood win\u201d. He goes on to discuss how inconsistent United have been this season. Rashford says United could have been more clinical and the team really had to grind it out. He adds the result will do a lot for the team. Daniel James was my Man of the Match. Williams, Rashford and Fred also had good games. Nice to see United grind out a result, to be honest. United were certainly the better team and deserved the win against a Burnley team who offered very little. James is the man breaking once again, he slips in Rashford, who rounds the goalkeeper, then falls over and just about slips the ball into the net to seal the win. 90+4 mins: A corner to Burnley. Pope is up. It is sent deep and cleared, then pumped back in to the back post, resulting in cries for a penalty after an alleged handball. Nothing is given. 90+2 mins: Fred drives United forward, spreading the play to Shaw on the left-hand side of the area, only to see the sub pass a dreadful cross which is blocked and cleared. Williams is booked for diving after being taken out by Bardsley. A woeful decision by Dean. 90 mins: Five minutes added on. 89 mins: Burnley are keen to whack the ball into the box now but United are happy to take it. The attack breaks down when McNeil clips Williams. Shaw is on for Martial as United look to shut up the shop until New Year. 87 mins: Rashford is down clutching his face after being caught by Tarkowski\u2019s hand. It certainly isn\u2019t a foul, though, and the forward will be fine. Brady is Burnley\u2019s final change, replacing Cork. Will this make the difference? 85 mins: Taylor pleads for a corner and his cross is blocked by Young, claiming it hit the United man last but it actually clipped the Burnley full-back but going out. 83 mins: Pope whacks a free-kick long for the Burnley forwards to battle for but it comes straight back at the Clarets, with James breaking down the pitch and the ball ending up with Martial one-on-one with Pope, who comes out quickly to narrow the angle and is sends the Frenchman backwards. Burnley regroup and crowd out United in the end, but the visitors should now be out of sight. 81 mins: Taylor cleans out Young when challenging for a header after the United man beats him to it - the Burnley man avoids a second booking. 79 mins: Williams breaks out of defence and dribbles up field, passing the baton onto Rashford who runs into Tarkowski in the box and the Burnley defender clears. A little treat about Pellegrini being sacked. 76 mins: Cork is caught by Maguire on the edge of the area after some rare neat work from the Burnley attackers. Gudmundsson lines up the free-kick from 20 yards but he sends it marginally over. 75 mins: The BT Sport \u2018All Dayer\u2019 on January 1st makes it sound like a pub crawl, is that what they are going for? 73 mins: James needs lengthy treatment and in the end hobbles off to the side. Meanwhile, Lingard has replaced Pereira. 71 mins: Burnley are now playing at a respectable tempo and look dangerous on the ball. Taylor is the latest man to go in the book for fouling James, who is once again too quick for a defender and is caught on the ankle and is left on the deck. 69 mins: Wood wins a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left wing after being bundled over by Lindelof. McNeill swings it but the defence head it clear, conveniently to the least threatening player on the pitch, Phil Bardsley, who inexplicably hits a lovely drive which De Gea has to push wide. Gudmundsson has replaced Barnes as the dice are rolled. 67 mins: Rashford looks to send a pass through to Martial in the area but he collides on the edge of the box with Bardsley. It looks innocuous to me but I am sure VAR will look at it. Bardsley just does not see him coming. Nothing is given. 65 mins: Barnes chests down a long pass from Bardsley but the assistant inexplicably rules him to be offside and that is the end of that chapter. Down the other end, Rashford drives into the box but Rodriguez helps out Bardsley and they force the ball behind for a corner, which culminates with Matic dragging a shot wide. 63 mins: Dyche is speaking to his backroom staff about more changes. It must be Gudmundsson next ... 61 mins: With the world reeling from the news Pellegrini is out of work, Pereira takes centre stage once more by barging Taylor over. Mee goes into the book for a reckless challenge on James. Mee catches him around the knee as James does him for pace. Not a great effort from the Burnley skipper. 59 mins: McNeil gets the fans going with some dynamic wing play but his cross is blocked behind by Young. Westwood swings it in but Lindelof heads it out. It comes back to McNeil who drags his shot wide from inside the area. Rodriguez on for Hendrick. Ps West Ham have sacked Pellegrini. 57 mins: Taylor bends in a dangerous cross but Maguire reads it and heads clear, landing at Hendrick\u2019s feet but he can only lift it well over the bar. Looks like Rodriguez is coming on. 55 mins: Pereira drives towards the box, flicks it through to Martial who hits a clean shot from 18 yards out only to see Pope use his feet to repel the effort, proving his ankle is fine in the process. 53 mins: Burnley might need to do some business in the window, as this lot look devoid of ideas. Maybe a right winger would be a good idea if Lennon isn\u2019t firing. Speaking of which, McNeil seems to have moved to the right. 51 mins: NO GOAL! A cross is fired into the box, Martial controls it but is then adjudged to have fouled Tarkowski, so the Frenchman smashing the ball in from six yards proves fruitless. 49 mins: Rashford tries to get the better of Tarkowski in the area but the defender does well and diverts the ball out for a corner. Hendrick receives the ball 25 yards from goal and instead of slipping in Bardsley in on the overlap, he whacks a shot high and wide, much to the home fans\u2019 chagrin. Joe Harvey offers: \u201cIt seems like the threat of Joe Hart is better than any magic spray. You think Dyche would have Pope out there short of a gaping leg wound, and even then.\u201d 47 mins: Burnley are showing some early promise that they will up the tempo in this half after a pretty sedate opening 45 minutes. Here we go again! Pope is back out for the second half. His ankle must be fine. I genuinely can\u2019t imagine how bad Philip Schofield is at football in real life. The night gets worse for Justin Kavanagh: \u201cFor one moment there, I thought it was divine intervention that Pope was about to be subbed off and Saint Joseph would get a run-out with a big point to prove. But it\u2019s a Hartless game.\u201d How can Burnley change things? Gudmundsson would be good to add a bit more pace down the flank, as it things are a touch pedestrian with Hendrick there. Half-time reading: It has not been a Christmas cracker. Both teams have played at a pretty lethargic pace but United have certainly been the better side and merit their lead. Burnley have barely threatened the centre-backs despite their hustling strikers and really need to come up with something else after the break. 45 mins: Three minutes to be added on. A shambles from Taylor on the touchline as he is dispossessed by Pereira, who quickly sends in a cross to Martial. The Frenchman gets the ball out of his feet and slots home from close range. Burnley only have themselves to blame. 42 mins: Hart has gone to sit back down. In other goalkeeping news: De Gea whacks the ball straight out of play. The resulting long throw ends up with Barnes in the area but he smashes his shot high and wide. 40 mins: Hart is readying himself to come on. Pope is up once more and looks like he will try to carry on. Poor Joe Hart. 38 mins: Fred is dictating things in the middle of the park, his latest work puts in Williams on the left, his cross flashes along the six-yard line but Mee does well to put Martial off and it goes away. Pope rolls his ankle repositioning himself for the cross and his game could be over. Hart on? 36 mins: Sean King is thinking of January: \u201cLots of talk of talk of Maddison, Sancho and Haland to Utd, but stick Grealish and Adama Traore in this side and United would be immense going forward.\u201d Who will United get? 34 mins: HOW HAS THAT NOT GONE IN?! Williams arrives on the overlap and lifts a cross over everyone to James at the back post, his original shot bounces out to Martial six yards from goal and he smashes it at goal, only to have it cleared off the line from Bardsley. Incredible stuff from the Burnley full-back. 32 mins: Burnley finally create an attack which looks like it is going somewhere until Bardsley completely fails to find Westwood five yards away from him. United then break and it ends up with Rashford on the right who drives a cross from the byline straight at Mee who finds himself in the perfect position to stop the cross. 30 mins: Rashford thwacks another free-kick form 35 yards, which clips off the top of the wall and heads over the bar. The corner is headed clear by Bardsley, who then checks to make sure his hair is still in place. 28 mins: Mee catches Martial on the heel, probably just remind him that he\u2019s there. Maguire and Mee have a long argument about it, which results in a smirk from the Burnley skipper and telling the United man to get back in his box. 26 mins: Wood kicks Maguire in the face, as you do. There is no malice from Wood, just an honest attempt to get the ball. Burnley are keeping it tight here and just waiting for a set-piece to put United under pressure. 24 mins: Williams is fouled once more, this time by former United full-back Bardsley who catches him quite late while trying to get into the box. Pereira whips the free-kick in from the left but it is headed clear with minimal fuss. Justin Kavanagh says: \u201cAs it\u2019s Christmas, I\u2019ve a fiver bet on Burnley keeping this game scoreless, based on the faithful\u2019s belief (though not mine) that the Pope is infallible. Judging by his first few touches, I haven\u2019t a prayer!\u201d We want goals! 22 mins: Burnley earn a corner off Fred which never was and the Brazilian gets very angry with the referee. United will not want face many corners tonight, especially ones that are not merited. Luckily for all involved it comes to nothing. 20 mins: United break on Burnley at pace, culminating in Rashford getting the ball on the edge of the box and whacking a shot against the foot of the post and wide. 18 mins: Needless to say, United look more creative as Burnley just aim it up to the two big men. Williams does well to get away from Wood, who earns his revenge by somehow removing the defender\u2019s boot. Burnley hit a long free-kick into the box which Tarkowski knocks down for someone to attack but it ends up with De Gea. 16 mins: A one-two between James and Rashford releases the former to get away from Taylor, who brings him down just before he reaches the area. It is a cynical challenge but he does not get a booking. Fred whacks the free-kick well over. 14 mins: Tarkowski pulls down Fred around 35 yards from goal. Rashford lines it up and hits it wonderfully with power and precision, forcing Pope to dive to his left to palm away the swerving ball at around hip height. 12 mins: Barnes has spent half the game in the air trying to flick the ball on to someone or other and the rest moaning to the referee about getting pushed in the back while jumping. Mike Dean, naturally, is having none of it. Probably because both sides played two days ago, the pace of the match can only be described as slow. 10 mins: Rashford shouts in pain after being caught by Westwood. It does not look too bad but Rashford does take a kick on the top of his foot. The forward has looked United\u2019s main threat thus far, so they will want him at 100 per cent. 8 mins: Great work by Taylor on the left wing sees the full-back beat two men and chip a cross to the back post but his opposite number, Williams, is there to flick it clear before a claret shirt can get their head on it. 6 mins: Pope runs 20 yards out of his goal, takes a poor touch and is almost closed down by Martial but just about gets his clearance away. Young is on the deck after getting a little push in the back from Barnes. The United full-back hits the ground hard and looks in pain. After treatment he seems fine to continue. 4 mins: Rashford lifts a ball over the top for Pereira to chase but he is beaten to it by Pope, who decides to push it onto the midfielder, who knocks it out for a goal kick, rather than catch it. Whatever his intention, it worked. 2 mins: Burnley are looking to put the balls into the channels and Barnes has already earned a free-kick from Maguire. A positive start from the hosts. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The players are out on the pitch and Turf Moor is looking packed. Hopefully the teams will put on a show. I have a feeling it is not warm in Burnley. But the Burnley team are all in short sleeves apart from Hendrick. No shortage of things going on here ... Matic, Pereira and Fred is possibly the least terrifying midfield three United have put out in the Premier League. On BT Sport Marcus Rashford is taking Robin van Persie around Manchester and has been explaining the homeless issue there. As someone from the city, he is absolutely right to raise awareness of how bad the situation has become. He\u2019s a good egg. I always get a little tinge of sadness when I see Joe Hart on a bench; he was so good for Man City for so long and since then has, metaphorically, fallen off a cliff. Stats ... A busy time for the Pope. Have United recovered? Anyway ... when will we stop talking about the actual football and turn our thoughts to VAR? I will go for the 17th minute No surprises in the Burnley team. They will be even more excited looking at the United side. I suspect McNeil will be happier to face Young than Wan Bissaka. January transfer plans ... No Pogba, so they have dusted off Matic for the game. His last league appearance came in September. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Taylor, Tarkowski, Mee, Cork, Hendrick, Westwood, McNeil, Barnes, Wood Subs: Hart, Lowton, Gudmundsson, Drinkwater, Brady, Rodriguez, Long Manchester United: De Gea, Young, Lindelof, Maguire, Williams, Fred, Matic, Pereira, James, Martial, Rashford Subs: Romero, Jones, Mata, Lingard, Shaw, Greenwood, Wan-Bissaka. Good evening! Sean Dyche\u2019s Burnley sit happily in mid-table and are not even looking over their shoulder, so will be very content with life. The squad and style are pretty much set and they will certainly make life difficult for a Manchester United team on a high after thrashing Newcastle. Scott McTominay will be missing for United having knacked his knee on Boxing Day and it will be interesting to see how much the team misses him, especially up against a side as well-drilled as Burnley. The Clarets will be ready to rough up United\u2019s back four, even resting Ashley Barnes for the Everton defeat in order to ensure he would be raring to go against Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof. The lack of McTominay should have meant a Premier League start for Paul Pogba after a couple of promising cameos in the last two games and he is someone United need if they are to challenge for the top four but he is absent again, it would seem. Burnley\u2019s back four impressed against Everton until the killer blow from Dominic Calvert-Lewin so will be looking to go one better against Rashford and Martial. Anyway, it should be a cracker at Turf Moor. Kick-off: 7.45pm (GMT)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
