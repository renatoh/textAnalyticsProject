The fight will mark Klitschko\u2019s first bout on American soil in seven years. Klitschko (63-3, 54 KOs), the lineal champion who holds three of the four major alphabet titles, will be making his 18th defense \u2014 second only to Joe Louis (25) and Larry Holmes (20) among heavyweights. Unbeaten since a 2004 loss to Lamon Brewster, Klitschko\u2019s last outing was a fifth-round knockout of mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev in November. Jennings (19-0, 10 KOs) scaled the heavyweight ladder with a pair of HBO-televised wins against undefeated contenders Artur Szpilka and Mike Perez in 2014. Until August, the 30-year-old balanced his boxing career with a full-time day job as a mechanic in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s facilities department. \u201cThis is the moment I have been waiting for,\u201d Jennings said in a statement. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to bring the belts home.\u201d Klitschko currently holds the IBF, WBA and WBO belts. The WBC title \u2014 vacated by Vitali Klitschko when he retired in 2013 \u2014 now belongs to Deontay Wilder, who outpointed Bermane Stiverne on Saturday in Las Vegas. A Klitschko-Wilder fight to fully unify the heavyweight championship for the first time since Lennox Lewis in 2000 now looms, but the 38-year-old Ukranian will need to get past Jennings first. Long speculated to take place at Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center, it was confirmed on Tuesday the fight will take place at Madison Square Garden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
