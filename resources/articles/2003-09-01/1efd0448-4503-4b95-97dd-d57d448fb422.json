The Republican-controlled Senate has blocked the regulations passed three months ago by the federal communications commission. Under the proposed changes, TV networks would be allowed to own local stations up to a collective reach of 45% of the national audience, an increase from the present level of 35%. Other rules would permit companies to own a newspaper, a television station and several radio stations in a single market, and to own two local television stations in more local markets. That means Mr Murdoch, for example, would find it easier to extend his newspaper portfolio in the US, which currently consists of the New York Post tabloid. And he could buy another TV station in the nine cities where Fox already owns two - New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, Minneapolis, Dallas, Phoenix, Orlando and Houston. Today's 55-40 knockback in the Senate comes ahead of a similar vote in the House of Representatives, and if necessary, President Bush could use his veto to uphold the measures. In parallel with the political action, media giants such as Viacom, Disney and General Electric face a court battle against media advocacy groups who believe the proposed changes would endanger diversity and localism in US media. A Philadelphia court yesterday upheld its judgement that the rules could not be implemented yet, denying media companies an attempt to take their case to the Washington appeals court. The FCC, led by Republican Michael Powell, son of secretary of state Colin, sparked outrage when it voted 3-2 in favour of the changes in June, with vocal opposition coming from either side of the political divide and from a range of lobby groups, including the National Rifle Association. But the networks say they need to acquire more local stations to compete more efficiently with cable and satellite television services. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
