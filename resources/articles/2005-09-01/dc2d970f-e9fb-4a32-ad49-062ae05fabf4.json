As the founder of Daiei, he revolutionised the Japanese retail industry, drawing people from traditional, locally run stores with cheap, US-style superstores. He secured his firm's dominance with ambitious buyouts of ailing competitors when hostile takeovers were almost unknown in Japan. He started in retail after the second world war, helping his father to sell medicine in Kobe, and opened his first pharmacy in Osaka in 1957."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
