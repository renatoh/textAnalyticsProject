Chris Delay: We were all at the Imperial College in London together, and me, Mark and Johnny were all doing computing. Tom was doing electrical engineering. When university was coming to an end, Uplink [2001] was ready, and we all started thinking about what to do with it. TG: How did you fare selling the game independently? CD: We did OK, actually, and were quite pleased with it. It was our first company, and we did all right, but we didn't really make enough to fund the next game. The turning point came when PC Gamer reviewed Uplink. Before then, no one had really heard of us. TG: Is it true you all still work from home? CD: Yeah, that's true. We've always done it that way, mainly because we haven't been able to afford an office. We just have laptops and meet through Skype. But it's not much of an issue, because there aren't that many developers at Introversion. Of the original directors, it was only me who did the development work on the games. The other two thirds were business and PR. So, there was no real reason for us to liaise on a daily basis, because our own areas don't cross that much. We speak several times a week on Skype and usually meet once a month or so in London, where we have big, day-long, 12-hour meetings. TG: Darwinia [2005], Uplink, and now DEFCON [2006] were released on Valve's digital distribution system, Steam. How has this helped sales? CD: Steam sold as many copies of Darwinia in its first month than we'd sold all the time we'd been running. They have a massive, established audience, so it's a great way to get your game out to a lot of people very quickly. TG: Is online distribution the future for small companies like Introversion? CD: Definitely. I think for a company like ours, retail really is a loser's game. TG: Wouldn't it be easier to be attached to a major publisher? CD: Sure, but Introversion's sort of \"unspoken mission\" has always been to make really creative games, which means not making deals with big publishers. This way, we can maintain our own creative integrity. A lot of UK game development companies have joined with big publishers to get bigger and more established. The problem with that, though, is that they lose the flexibilities that allowed them to try out the crazy ideas that made them so creative to start with. With Darwinia, we had 18 months of experimentation before we had a real game. And that experimentation really helped to make it very unusual. It would also bankrupt most big game developers. TG: Your games are known for their inorganic, minimalist aesthetic. Why? CD: We don't want to do things that look rubbish; we just don't necessarily want to do things that are photorealistic. TG: Do you think that abandoning the \"photorealism race\" makes your games more timeless? CD: Absolutely. As a case in point, Uplink still sells now on our website. It actually frequently sells more than Darwinia. TG: DEFCON, your latest title, takes this aesthetic even further: the entire game is based on a single world map. Did this make the game's development cycle less fraught than Darwinia's? CD: Oh, yes. Initially, I actually wanted to make the whole game in one day. I was going to do a massive, 24-hour coding session. I was optimistic because there's no content in DEFCON; it's the exact opposite of realism; it's total abstraction. We didn't even draw the world map - there was world map data freely available with all the city data in the world. So, it was just a matter of sorting that data off the internet, and then [rendering] the map into DEFCON's lovely, low-quality vector style. TG: But it didn't end up taking a day to build, did it? CD: No. I did it for a few days, realising it was going to take a bit longer, but after seven days, actually, I had a fully working prototype and multiplayer - you could play it over a local area network. But this was back in 2003. We were still developing Darwinia, and I'd become a bit bored with it. The total time it took was probably about a year from start to finish, and that included about five months of testing. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
