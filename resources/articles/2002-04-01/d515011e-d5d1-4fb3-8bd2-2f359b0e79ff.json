The news comes hard on the heels of revelations that the team are threatened with the loss of their Honda engine supply deal for 2003, which could punch a further \u00a320m hole in the operating budget. In a move that mirrors David Richards's recent reduction in staffing levels at British American Racing, the other Honda factory-backed team, Jordan will slash 15% of the workforce. The team lost Benson &amp; Hedges as title sponsor at the start of this season and though the cigarette company remains a co-sponsor it is believed Jordan lost about \u00a310m of income through the change. Those to go include the joint managing director, the highly regarded Trevor Foster, who directed Jordan during the team's best season in 1999 when they were third in the constructors' championship behind Ferrari and McLaren-Mercedes. Also leaving with immediate effect is Tim Holloway, the head of engineering. The team principal Eddie Jordan is to take more day-to-day control of sporting and commercial matters, and the former McLaren aerodynamicist Henri Durand and the director of race and test engineering Gary Anderson will control the technical side. \"Jordan has always been at its best when lean and efficient,\" said Eddie Jordan. \"Once you sense complacency creeping in, or costs becoming exorbitant, a prudent business needs to take action. \"We have an incredible group of people at Jordan who work tirelessly to achieve on-track success. These changes will generate a more efficient structure at a time when our focus is on the performance and reliability of our cars.\" It is thought the team's recent poor form has galvanised Eddie Jordan into action. \"He has no intention of letting his team go down the pan like Alain Prost's,\" said one insider. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
