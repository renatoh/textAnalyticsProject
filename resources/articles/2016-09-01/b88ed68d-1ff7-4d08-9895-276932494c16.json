With injury sidelining Fabio Borini until late December and the newly recruited free agent Victor Anichebe still some way from match fitness, Jermain Defoe is Moyes\u2019 only fit forward for Monday\u2019s home game against Everton . Although too diplomatic to criticise Ellis Short, Sunderland\u2019s owner, the manager is disappointed not to have a better stocked armoury to aid the task of turning his latest club into the \u201cnew Everton\u201d. Moyes is wary about \u201cbanging on too much\u201d about the 11 years he spent at Goodison Park but comparisons between the two similarly sized clubs are irresistible and Everton remain the template for what the former Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager hopes to achieve at the Stadium of Light. \u201cWe had a great team at Goodison but we were missing a centre-forward. We couldn\u2019t get the finances to buy one in my last couple of years,\u201d said Moyes, who has Sunderland\u2019s record \u00a313.5m signing Didier Ndong available for selection after the Gabon midfielder, signed from Lorient, solved visa problems. \u201cI might be exaggerating but I think, with a top centre-forward, we would have been close to winning the league; we were that good.\u201d Not that he was minded to hurl any toys from prams. \u201cI have to be fair,\u201d he said. \u201cBill Kenwright [Everton\u2019s chairman] was always trying to help me and every penny he had he gave me. I don\u2019t have any complaints. It was also a brilliant education. It\u2019s good to have a bit of money but it\u2019s also sometimes good to realise you\u2019ve got to get out on to the training ground and teach players, build them into a team.\u201d With Sunderland accruing consistent financial losses and Short singed by several bewildering buys imported by a series of managers, the American financier hopes Moyes can perform a similar feat on Wearside. \u201cI see Everton as a very similar club to Sunderland,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cWhen I first joined it felt like avoiding relegation every season was good enough. So we started to change that. I had a budget of \u00a35m a year but we got there in the end. We consistently finished in the top eight. \u201cSunderland aren\u2019t going to be the biggest spenders, just like Everton weren\u2019t. It\u2019s going to be tough and take time \u2013 at least three or four transfer windows \u2013 but I want, in my own way, to do a Leicester here. It might not mean winning the Premier League but finishing in a high position.\u201d Most of Moyes\u2019s predecessors \u2013 Moyes is Sunderland\u2019s seventh manager in five years \u2013 bought into the mantra that players do not want to live in the north-east but he disagrees, attributing the club\u2019s lack of pulling power to persistent instability and underachievement. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s geography,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that players want to play in good teams at good clubs. We had some players who I thought would sign this summer but they didn\u2019t want to come here. It wasn\u2019t just to do with money and I was a bit disappointed but we have to build a good team people want to join. \u201cAt the moment Sunderland has got everything except league position. If we\u2019re winning regularly players will fancy coming here. I don\u2019t know if people believe that at the moment so I have to be the one to change it.\u201d Sunderland (4-2-3-1, probable): Pickford; Manquillo, Kon\u00e9, Djilobodji, Van Aanholt; Kirchhoff; Januzaj, Pienaar, Rodwell, Gooch; Defoe. Everton (4-2-3-1, probable): Stekelenburg; Coleman, Williams, Jagielka, Baines; Gueye, Barry; Mirallas, Barkley, Bolasie; Lukaku."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
