The case has been passed on to her governing body, USA Track and Field, and it will be dealt with by the American anti-doping agency. If the sprinter is found guilty she will lose the gold medals she won in the 100m and 200m in last month's World Championships in Paris and the $120,000 (\u00a376,000) prize money she would have received because she will be disqualified from the competition. White claimed she took modafinil to combat the sleeping disorder narcolepsy and insisted she did not declare it to the IAAF because it was not on the list of banned substances. She tested positive after the 100m. The IAAF has since announced that because modafinil is a minor stimulant she will incur a public warning and disqualification but no ban if found guilty of the offence. On Friday White won the 100m in the Golden League meeting in Brussels and this weekend she is due to compete in the World Athletics Final in Monte Carlo where, ironically, the IAAF has its headquarters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
