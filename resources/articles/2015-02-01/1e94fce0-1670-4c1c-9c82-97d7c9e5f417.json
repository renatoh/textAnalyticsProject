In his first television interview since Mitt Romney pulled out of the race for the GOP\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination, Walker, 47, suggested Americans \u201cdon\u2019t want to go back in time, they don\u2019t want to repeat what we\u2019ve had in the past\u201d. On the face of it the remark was a dig at the former first lady, senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. But it was also, it seemed, aimed Bush, the former Florida governor who is seeking to follow his brother and father into the White House. Walker received a significant boost on Saturday when he topped a poll of Iowa Republicans carried out by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg. Reaping the benefits of a successful speech to Iowa conservatives the preceding weekend, Walker leapfrogged more established candidates and secured 15% of the vote \u2013 up from 4% in October. The result put him effectively neck-and-neck with Rand Paul, who did not attend the Iowa Freedom Summit but still managed to secure 14% support among Republicans in Iowa, which hosts the first caucus in the party\u2019s nomination season. Just 8% of respondents said Bush would be their first choice for president. With a year to go before the Iowa caucus, very little should be gleaned from the tea leaves of opinion polls. At this stage, surveys are an indication of name recognition as much as popularity, and the roller-coaster nomination process virtually guarantees that candidates who go up will come back down. But the poll does, nonetheless, give early momentum to Walker, whom strategists have long-tipped as a dark horse in a crowded field of presidential aspirants. Romney, announcing his departure from the race on Friday, said he expected the successful nominee to be a less well-known figure in the party who is is \u201cjust getting started\u201d. Asked on ABC\u2019s This Week Sunday morning show if he took that to be reference to himself, Walker replied: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to take on a name from the past, which is likely to be former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, I think for the party we need a name from the future.\u201d Walker gave every impression he thought that name should be his. \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you one thing,\u201d he said when pressed on whether he would run. \u201cAfter three elections for governor in four years in a state that hasn\u2019t gone Republican since 1984 for president, I wouldn\u2019t bet against me on anything.\u201d His remarks about Clinton being a candidate from the past were carefully worded to include a reference to the Republican primary contest. In other words, a swipe at Bush, 61, who was elected governor of Florida in 1999 and who, like Clinton, his associated with a dynasty from the past. \u201cI think the biggest thing I hear from Americans applies both in the primary contest and I think in the general,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is I think people want to look to the future. They don\u2019t want to go back in time, they don\u2019t want to repeat what we\u2019ve had in the past. We need a candidate not of the 20th century, but of the 21st century.\u201d That playbook \u2013 knocking both Clinton and Bush with the same punch \u2013 is expected to be repeated by other Republican hopefuls. Paul, the most strategically inventive candidate in the Republican field, adopted a similar strategy when he released a \u201csecret tape\u201d about a fictional phone-call between Clinton and Bush. Unlike Paul, who has been willing to take libertarian positions he knows are not popular with his party, Walker is more of a cookie-cutter politician, whose early success has been attributed to his appeal to both conservative and moderate Republicans. But the luxury of appealing to all corners of the the ideologically divided GOP will not last throughout the nomination process, which forces candidates to stake out their territory, including over complex areas of foreign policy. Walker showed his vulnerability on that front when pressed hard by ABC host Martha Raddatz over his policy on Syria. After bumbling an answer about the need for an \u201caggressive\u201d stance toward Islamic extremists, Walker added: \u201cWe have to look at other surgical methods. And ultimately, we have to be prepared to put boots on the ground if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d \u201cBoots on the ground in Syria?\u201d Raddatz replied, sensing a foreign policy blunder. \u201cUS boots on the ground in Syria?\u201d Walker backtracked. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is an immediate plan,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think anywhere in the world \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d In an attempt to defend his national security credentials, Walker also spoke of \u201crisk assessments given to me by the FBI and my adjutant general\u201d in his role as governor of Wisconsin. Walker is following a well-traveled path for Republican presidential candidates who want to improve their foreign policy credentials \u2013 meeting former secretary of state Henry Kissinger and arranging a visit to London. Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal visited London last month, while New Jersey governor Chris Christie arrived in the British capital for a similar trip on Sunday. Christie, well known for his love of sports teams including the Dallas Cowboys, kicked off his visit by attending Arsenal\u2019s 5-0 Premier League win over Aston Villa at the Emirates Stadium. Florida senator Marco Rubio, who visited London last year and believes himself to be among the most knowledgeable foreign policy experts exploring a presidential run, recently mocked the string of governors taking foreign trips. \u201cTaking a trip to some foreign city for two days doesn\u2019t make you Henry Kissinger either,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve got to spend some time on these issues that are important issues for the country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
