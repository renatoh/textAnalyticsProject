People flee such countries in the hope of finding a better life in safer societies, such as Britain. That they may encounter a system which grimly echoes the one they fled shames us. Today, The Observer reveals the scandal of a senior immigration official accused of seeking sex from an asylum seeker in exchange for help to win her case. James Dawute selected a young woman who had come to Lunar House, the immigration service headquarters in Croydon, in desperate need of help. A teenager who had suffered terrible abuse in her native Zimbabwe found that her quest for asylum might lead to a sleazy hotel-room encounter with a civil servant. Mr Dawute has been suspended pending a Home Office investigation. That will be the second such investigation this year. In March, a report into allegations that immigration officials were demanding 'sex for visas' concluded that no such racket existed. But it also revealed a culture of bad practice, in which undertrained, under-supervised staff bypassed security procedures and treated applicants with contempt. Most worrying, it indicated that front-line staff had little understanding of what constitutes inappropriate, even corrupt, conduct. The report made tame procedural recommendations that appear to have been of little consequence. The Observer's revelations will make grim reading for the Home Secretary whose department is already groaning under a weight of scandal. Last week, David Roberts, the civil servant responsible for removing illegal immigrants from the UK, shocked MPs by admitting he had 'not the faintest idea' of the numbers concerned. Mr Roberts's remark was disturbing and yet refreshing in its candour. By definition, illegal immigrants evade identification and so cannot be counted. His failure to conjure a statistic affronted the government's love of numerical targets as the benchmark of progress. But it also stoked public fear of an invisible horde of foreign interlopers. The problem that needs urgently to be addressed is not the number of Britain's illegal workers - although there are too many - but the crisis of confidence in the state's ability to manage its borders. Insecurity about the immigration system breeds racism towards those who come through it. Xenophobia is everywhere in the debate on these issues. Mistrust of outsiders is encouraged when politicians and the media routinely fail to distinguish between immigrants, who come to the UK to work or study, and asylum seekers, who come for sanctuary. We have sound economic reasons to welcome a managed intake of foreign labour and moral reasons, not to mention treaty obligations, to take in genuine refugees. But the arguments for a liberal migration policy cannot even be heard unless all are seen to be conscientiously vetted. That is the purpose of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and it is clearly unfit. The 'caseworkers' who process applications are poorly paid and poorly qualified. They are recruited from the bottom of the Civil Service chain. Their output - the number of cases they process - is monitored but their treatment of applicants is not assessed. Promotion, as elsewhere in the Civil Service, depends more on length than on quality of service. In a culture where asylum seekers and immigrants are usually portrayed as likely abusers of the system, it is not surprising that the system sometimes ends up abusing them. Thanks to the exceptional courage of one young woman, a terrible dereliction of duty has been exposed at Lunar House. When this episode is matched to prior revelations, the case for sweeping institutional change becomes unarguable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
