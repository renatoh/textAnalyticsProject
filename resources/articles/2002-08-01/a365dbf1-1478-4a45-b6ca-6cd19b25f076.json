The Cumbrians emerged from a weekend of punch-ups, squabbles and allegations of racial abuse with their new chairman John Courtenay likely to face an FA disrepute charge. Trouble flared as Carlisle won 1-0 at Lincoln City in the Third Division on Saturday, a match that saw four players sent off and a touchline brawl between Courtenay, the United striker Richie Foran and a home steward on the final whistle. The Lincoln chairman Rob Bradley intends to report Courtenay to the FA for causing \"mischief\". After celebrating a fluffed attempt at an equaliser, the Irish businessman had to be escorted from the directors' box. Courtenay insists that a Sincil Bank steward then threatened to punch him and Foran, provoking the bundle that ended with the trio toppling over an advertising hoarding by the players' tunnel. Adding to the sense of farce, the United manager Roddy Collins - brother of the former world super-middleweight boxing champion Steve - accused the referee Paul Robinson of being the \"worst I have seen in my life\", Lincoln City as being a \"disgrace\" and their supporters of subjecting his Irish players to a torrent of racist abuse. \"If City try to report us they will end up in trouble because I will say exactly what happened,\" said Courtenay, whose arrival in Cumbria was supposed to prompt more tranquil times after a decade of turmoil under Knighton. \"They are the ones who used physical force, not us, but it was a scuffle, just a storm in a teacup. \"A bloke grabbed Richie and tried to pull him. Richie fell on the barrier and I ended up falling on him. A steward was threatening me, but didn't actually hit me. I can't be bothered to report them, but if they want to be childish, they can.\" \"They treated John despicably,\" added Collins, who only returned to Cumbria in the summer after Knighton sold the club and had seen Foran, the matchwinner Trevor Molloy and Brian Shelley all sent off along with Lincoln's Simon Weaver. \"John went to give Richie a bit of protection and they started on him - it was unbelievable - and the racial abuse we received from a section of the crowd was not nice. It doesn't bother me, but it is not nice for the young kids. \"As for the referee, he was an absolute disgrace. I hope that was not an anti-Irish thing because that would be very sad. He sent three of my players off and gave a dubious penalty to them. The only thing missing was putting on a Lincoln jersey. \"The whole set-up at Lincoln was a joke. It was the worst situation I have been in as a manager and the worst advert for football I have ever seen, but justice was done in the end.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
