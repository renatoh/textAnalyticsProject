The historical fascination, however, is that this quartet (with pianist Red Garland, bassist Oscar Pettiford, and drummer Philly Joe Jones) was formed at the time when the trumpeter had just got off heroin, and shortly before his legendary \"comeback\" performance at the Newport Jazz festival and the formation of his great 1950s quintet, including Garland, Jones and John Coltrane. Garland's bright, jangly piano sound and percussively chordal approach is a major strength after the trumpeter's nimble, though occasionally rather impassive, improvisations. But Pettiford, normally a powerhouse, sounds ponderous, and even the explosive Jones seems subdued, despite an inviting classic like A Night in Tunisia. It's a completist's item only."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
