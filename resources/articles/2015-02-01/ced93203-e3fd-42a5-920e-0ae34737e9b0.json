Gatland, who moved to Wales from his native New Zealand at the end of 2007, is the longest serving head coach of a tier-one nation. He signed that contract extension in December 2013 to take him through to a third World Cup and while he has no intention of resigning because of the impending change at the top, he said the new chief executive may have a different outlook. Asked if Lewis\u2019s departure would have any impact on his role as head coach, he replied: \u201cYes, it probably does.\u201d He initially declined to elaborate on the remark but later added: \u201cOften those decisions aren\u2019t in your hands, are they? \u201cI have signed until 2019 and I have made my commitment to Welsh rugby. You hope that can continue. Professional sport is all about performance, it is all about results, and sometimes it is about other people making decisions for you. \u201cThe support Roger has given the national side since I have been here has been outstanding. There\u2019s no doubt we have got some of the best rugby facilities in the world. When we have gone to Roger to ask for things for the team, whether it\u2019s been staff or facilities, he has done it for us. He\u2019s going to leave Welsh rugby in a very healthy state for the challenges that lie ahead so somebody who comes in can continue his good work.\u201d Gatland\u2019s immediate priority is masterminding a fourth consecutive victory over France this weekend. He has dropped four players from the side that defeated Scotland for the trip to Paris having confined himself to changes because of injury after the opening night defeat to England. Gatland has left out two of his 2013 Lions, the wing Alex Cuthbert and the hooker Richard Hibbard. Cuthbert makes way for George North \u2013 who was not selected for Murrayfield having taken two knocks on the head against England \u2013 while Hibbard, after poor line-out returns this year, is replaced by Scott Baldwin, who played in the November victory over South Africa. North, at 22, will become the youngest player to reach the 50-cap mark having played in three Tests for the Lions. Luke Charteris comes in for Jake Ball in the second row to give Baldwin a taller target to aim at and the tight-head prop Samson Lee, who was concussed against England and did not recover in time to face Scotland, replaces Aaron Jarvis. Victory would put Wales back in the title race with the top two, Ireland and England, meeting in Dublin on Sunday. \u201cWe need to rely on a couple of other results but if we defeat France and then Ireland beat England, they come to Cardiff next,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cIf we win that game, it would give us the opportunity to go into the final weekend to win the championship. We were disappointed at how we played in the second half against England but this team responds to pressure and I feel we do improve during campaigns. I think France will be under pressure to play a bit of rugby having been relatively conservative.\u201d Sam Warburton will lead Wales for the 33rd time, equalling Ryan Jones\u2019s national record. \u201cIt has crept up on me quite quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was never a motivation because the most important thing for me has always been playing for Wales. My focus is on ensuring we win because it is so important. Anything else that comes we will enjoy at the end of the Six Nations.\u201d Warburton said that the players were fully behind Gatland, adding: \u201cIf you look at his CV, Premierships and European Cups at club level and success with Wales and the Lions, he has got a winning formula in his game plan. Gats always has the backing of all the players and we have a lot of faith in the coaching staff.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
