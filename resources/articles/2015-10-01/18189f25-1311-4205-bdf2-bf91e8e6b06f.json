Guardian Australia understands the Clinton camp approached Gillard to be part of the video, which was shot in New York this month. In the video, Gillard praises the former secretary of state\u2019s commitment to girls\u2019 education. \u201cHillary Clinton understood in her heart how important it was for girls to get an opportunity, but she also understood in her head that if we want to build peaceful, economically prosperous nations, then we have to educate girls,\u201d Gillard says. \u201cShe was determined to see that women take their place as economic partners in their community, and take their place as political leaders in their community.\u201d Gillard also praises the \u201ccalibre\u201d of Clinton\u2019s intellect in engaging with the Asia-Pacific region. She was a \u201cshaper of conversations, and that\u2019s going to be remembered for many, many long years to come as a diplomatic breakthrough for the US\u201d, Gillard says. Clinton\u2019s time as US secretary of state coincided with Gillard\u2019s prime ministership. Clinton publicly praised Gillard\u2019s efforts to call out sexism and Gillard offered Clinton advice on doing the same. Since leaving politics, Gillard has taken up a role with the Global Partnership on Education, an organisation that aims at increasing access to basic education for disadvantaged children. She has often spoken about the benefits of boosting literacy and numeracy rates for girls, last month telling an audience at the University of Adelaide, where she is an honorary professor, that it is \u201cmorally just and right to educate girls\u201d. While still prime minister, Gillard chaired the UN millennium development goals advocacy group. Clinton is widely considered the frontrunner in the Democratic race, blitzing last week\u2019s candidates debate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
