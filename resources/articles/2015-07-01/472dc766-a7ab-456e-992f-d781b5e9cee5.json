This advice may well hold true, but if the mother in question is Sophie Hunter, wife of Benedict Cumberbatch, then it is best not to refer to her new maternal status. Although fans gathered on Valentine\u2019s Day to catch a glimpse of her Isle of Wight wedding to the star of Sherlock, and paparazzi have swooped this month for shots of the couple\u2019s first outings since the birth of their son, for Hunter, 37, it is definitely business as usual. And that business is avant-garde opera, and not being the other half of one of the most popular actors of the age. \u201cAt the moment my focus is on opera and classical music,\u201d said Hunter this weekend. The director and former performer is about to stage a unique immersive production of Benjamin Britten\u2019s baroque-style cantata Phaedra, based on a translation of Racine\u2019s tragedy and set near a deserted castle in Northern Ireland as part of Happy Days, the Samuel Beckett festival in Enniskillen. The time around the birth of her first baby has been filled, she said, with work: \u201cIt has been a combination of music rehearsals in London and hard graft building in Enniskillen prior to the performance. It\u2019s a very technical piece and it\u2019s on a large scale, so the entire creative team are setting up camp in an equestrian arena to build it.\u201d At the end of the month her audience will travel down winding paths to the arena in the grounds of Necarne castle to hear mezzo-soprano Ruby Philogene sing with the Ulster Orchestra, accompanied by film and light projections. The director, who brought out an album of French-language songs in 2005 as well as acting in television shows such as Midsomer Murders and Torchwood, comes from a well-heeled English background. Her grandfather was General Sir Michael James Gow, Aide-de-Camp General to the Queen in the early 80s, and her maternal great-great-grandfather was the first world war politician JEB Seely, Baron Mottistone. Born in London, she studied at Oxford University after attending the prestigious St Paul\u2019s girls school. But perhaps a family taste for adventure is evident in her father\u2019s decision to swap a career in insurance for the life of a professional card player, teaching bridge at London\u2019s Groucho Club, among other venues. Her own appetite for the wilder shores of art is now also clear. After training under mime artist Jacques Lecoq in Paris, she had a long relationship with the experimental sculptor Conrad Shawcross. Later this year she is to mount an equally adventurous production of another Britten work, The Turn of the Screw, working again with Staples at Snape Maltings for Aldeburgh Music. \u201cThis time we are working with Aurora Orchestra,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s another case of bringing a team of collaborators together from film, fine art, theatre and opera. We are writing the experience out there so we are heading out for a research residency at Snape. Until then it\u2019s model boxes, meetings, poring over the music and the text and getting increasingly excited at the prospect of another Britten adventure.\u201d Her interest in avant-garde entertainment dates back to her modern languages degree. \u201cGoing on to train with Lecoq in Paris meant I discovered European theatre at a formative moment growing up. Seeing the work of directors like Romeo Castellucci, Ivo van Hove, Thomas Ostermeier, and Simon McBurney and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Complicit\u00e9, was, and continues to be, hugely important to me. To my mind these are artists who are forging new languages of performance and storytelling, and their constant reinvention is very inspiring.\u201d Her own recent work in New York \u201cin the context of a truly experimental and independent \u2018downtown\u2019 theatre scene\u201d confirmed her path, she said. \u201cNew York was incredibly fulfilling and exciting.\u201d Hunter sees no real distinction between her niche work in opera and the kind of commercial success that her husband enjoys in films such as The Imitation Game or in next month\u2019s production of Hamlet at the Barbican, for which all but \u201con the day\u201d tickets sold out quickly. \u201cMy job now is to make work, to tell stories,\u201d Hunter said. But the director is not complacent about working in an area which usually escapes public attention. It is her mission to broaden both the world of opera and the public perception of it. \u201cThere is still a critical need for a new audience and for new ways of thinking about the presentation and accessibility of opera and the concerts. The work I am making with [music director] Andrew Staples aims to shake up the status quo a bit. Taking the work out of the opera house and the concert hall is just the beginning.\u201d Hunter\u2019s directorial debut in 2007 was at the Barbican Pit where she co-directed the avant-garde play The Terrific Electric. Since then she has directed a revival of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s Ghosts and created a piece of performance art titled Lucretia and based on Benjamin Britten\u2019s opera The Rape of Lucretia. Her production of the experimental play 69\u00b0 South, also known as Shackleton Project, premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and toured north America. She and Cumberbatch met acting together on the set of Susan Luciani\u2019s 2009 thriller Burlesque Fairytales, set in a 1930s theatre.
