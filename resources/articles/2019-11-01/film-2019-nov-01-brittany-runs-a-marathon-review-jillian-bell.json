Now here\u2019s a movie that could make her a star. Paul Downs Colaizzo\u2019s New York-set indie comedy gives Bell the platform for a lovely authentic performance as a woman who takes up running to lose weight and get fit. It\u2019s a film with charm and sweetness but a twinge of anxiety, a little gravitational pull to darker places. Bell is Brittany, a 28-year-old with issues recognisable from Amy Schumer\u2019s Trainwreck: binge-drinking, picking up the wrong guys, generally failing to sort out her life. When she tries to wheedle prescription drugs out of her GP, he instead warns that her BMI is in the obese range. \u201cYou totally missed the point of those Dove ads,\u201d she quips. Anyone who\u2019s ever pulled out a pair of saggy tracksuit bottoms from the back of the wardrobe for a tentative run will wince in recognition at Brittany\u2019s first attempt to reach the end of the block. But she sticks with it \u2013 and the movie twists in ways that make it feel fairly honest and emotionally complex, if a bit fussy plot-wise. Brittany\u2019s new sense of purpose threatens her friendship with her super-skinny roommate, who, as Brittany points out, enjoys having a funny fat sidekick. There\u2019s also a painful scene in which Brittany fat-shames another woman and realises how much she has internalised years of unkind comments. Brittany Runs a Marathon is very funny in places. And writer-director Colaizzo \u2013 who based the script on his real-life best friend \u2013 deserves credit for not sprinting to a thin-equals-happy ending. But the film doesn\u2019t quite hold its nerve; it goes a bit conventional romcom at the end. Still, that doesn\u2019t stop it being properly enjoyable. Take the scene where a woman turns Brittany down for job looking after her kids: \u201cYou have a great personality but we\u2019re looking for a nanny who\u2019ll fade into the background.\u201d As for Bell, she proves herself a natural film star. \u2022 Brittany Runs a Marathon is released in Australia on 31 October and in the UK on 1 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
