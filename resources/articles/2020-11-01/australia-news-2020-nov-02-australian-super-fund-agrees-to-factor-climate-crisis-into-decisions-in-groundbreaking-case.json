The settlement between the Retail Employees Superannuation Trust and Mark McVeigh, reached as a trial was due to start on Monday, requires the fund to ensure its actions are consistent with \u201cnet zero carbon footprint\u201d by 2050. The case was described as the first legal test of whether the requirement that super funds must keep members informed applied to climate-related risks, including an expected fall in demand for fossil fuels and a rise in damage to infrastructure due to extreme weather linked to rising global temperatures. As part of the settlement, the fund committed to disclose its full portfolio holdings, conduct climate scenario analysis to inform its investment strategy and advocate for the companies it invests in to comply with the goals of the Paris agreement. In a statement, it acknowledged that climate change could lead to catastrophic economic and social consequences, and was an important concern of its members. \u201cClimate change is a material, direct and current financial risk to the superannuation fund across many risk categories, including investment, market, reputational, strategic, governance and third-party risks,\u201d the fund said. McVeigh said the settlement was \u201cgroundbreaking recognition\u201d of the risk that the climate crisis poses to the economy and society, and would give the trust\u2019s nearly 2 million members assurance that their retirement savings would be invested responsibly. He said he hoped it would trigger similar commitments across the super fund industry. \u201cWith almost $3tn under management, [the industry] has the potential to make or break our climate response,\u201d he said. McVeigh\u2019s lawyer, David Barnden, of Equity Generation Lawyers, said it was the first time a major Australian super fund had agreed to settle a case about the financial risk of climate change and what it needed to do to protect its members. \u201cThe implications of this case are far-reaching for investors and for the climate,\u201d Barnden said. \u201cIt is clear the buck stops with board members and managing climate risk cannot be delegated away.\u201d McVeigh launched the action in the federal court in 2018 , shortly after he graduated from the University of Queensland with a degree in ecology. His case claimed under the Corporations Act the fund must seek information about climate risks and comply with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TFCD), a global body that aims to highlight companies\u2019 exposure to risks related to the climate crisis. The settlement includes an agreement from the fund that it would measure, monitor and report outcomes in line with the task force\u2019s recommendations. Barnden is also representing a 23-year-old university student who has accused the Australian government of misleading investors in sovereign bonds by failing to disclose the financial risk caused by the climate crisis. He is running a separate class action on behalf of young people from across the world which is trying to stop an extension of Whitehaven\u2019s Vickery coalmine in north-west NSW."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
