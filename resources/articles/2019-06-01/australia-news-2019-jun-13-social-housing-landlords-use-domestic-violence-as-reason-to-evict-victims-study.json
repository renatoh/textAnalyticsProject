In one shocking case, a disabled woman was evicted despite a tribunal noting she had been assaulted by her partner two weeks before the hearing. Researchers from two universities analysed lease terminations data, nearly 100 state tribunal and court decisions, as well as case studies from housing providers to assess the impact on the nation\u2019s most vulnerable tenants. They found women in social housing bore the brunt of \u201chard expectations\u201d to \u201ccontrol the misconduct of male partners and children\u201d who were either abusive, or had committed petty crimes, according to the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (Ahuri) study, released on Thursday. Social housing tenants were far more likely to face termination applications than those in the private market. In Victoria and NSW, public housing authorities applied to state tribunals to terminate around 5,000 leases each year, data collected by the researchers showed. Chris Martin, a social housing expert at the University New South Wales, said the most concerning cases uncovered were those where domestic violence was \u201cframed as a nuisance for which the tenant is responsible\u201d because of \u201cblunt instrument\u201d laws. \u2018Distressing\u2019, \u2018wretched\u2019 evictions In a 2017 case, Victoria\u2019s public housing authority evicted a woman with an acquired brain injury and a cognitive disorder from her home of nine years. The woman appealed, telling a tribunal much of the \u201cevidence presented related to her partner \u2026 over whom she had no control\u201d. She told the tribunal he had hit her \u201ctwo weeks\u201d before the hearing. But the department successfully argued the \u201cyelling, screaming, making loud noises, fighting and using threatening and abusive language\u201d represented a \u201cnuisance\u201d breach. The tribunal noted disruptive behaviour on behalf of the tenant, but also upheld breaches where she was the victim of abuse. That included an incident where her partner was \u201cmaking threats of violence towards the tenant\u201d. Martin said the case would have been \u201cdistressing\u201d for all involved, including the housing officers. In another \u201cwretched case\u201d, NSW authorities evicted an Indigenous single mother whose boyfriend was accused of making 20 small ($10-$20) marijuana deals in the backyard. The woman, a survivor of domestic violence from a previous relationship, was not charged, co-operated with police and ended the relationship. But a tribunal said it was powerless to exercise discretion, and having found an \u201cillegal use\u201d of the premise, evicted the mother and her children. Landlords can terminate leases when tenants have breached what are called \u201cprescribed terms\u201d, such as \u201cnuisance\u201d or \u201cillegal use\u201d. In most states, tenants must not \u201cpermit\u201d offences by others, including visitors, and are given \u201cthree strikes\u201d. Women were regularly held responsible for a partner\u2019s behaviour, one advocate said, \u201cbecause providers often sign up only one person as the named tenant, and often women are the ones filling out the paperwork\u201d. Leo Patterson Ross, a spokesman for the National Association of Tenant Organisations, said providers should take a \u201cgood hard look\u201d at whether polices to support violence survivors \u201ctranslate into practice on the ground\u201d. Children evicted into homelessness Other findings included that tenants had their alcohol and drug treatments disrupted by a zero-tolerance approach to substance abuse breaches, while children were usually only a \u201cmarginal consideration\u201d in the cases reviewed. \u201cChildren are evicted into homelessness as a result along with their parents,\u201d said Martin, who called for \u201cthe best interests of the child\u201d to become a \u201cparamount factor\u201d in terminations proceedings. Nearly half of the cases reviewed by the researchers involved people abusing drugs or alcohol, and social housing landlords \u2013 particularly those run by the government \u2013 almost uniformly took a zero-tolerance approach. New laws in Victoria let tenants apply to a tribunal to invalidate lease terminations within 30 days where domestic violence is a factor, though Martin said the process would still be problematic for vulnerable people. Changes in NSW protect tenants from being held responsible for property damage that occurred during domestic violence, though \u201cother breaches (e.g. nuisance) caused by a perpetrator may still be grounds for termination\u201d, the report said. Generally, public housing authorities took a tougher approach than community housing providers, which are run by non-profits. One Victorian community housing landlord exhibited an \u201centhusiastic\u201d framing of domestic violence as a \u201cbreach of tenancy agreements\u201d, while WA\u2019s public housing authority was accused of taking a \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d approach, the study said. Martin said tribunals and courts nationwide should have more power to exercise discretion and consider domestic violence factors in decisions. In WA, tenants can now ask a court to have a domestic violence perpetrator removed from a lease, among other reforms passed recently. Helen Nys, of the WA Department of Communities, said tenants were not \u201cheld responsible for incidents in which they were victims of domestic violence\u201d. \u201cWhere both the victim and perpetrator of domestic violence are legal tenants, the department will consider the appropriate action under the new provisions of the RTA,\u201d she said. A spokeswoman for NSW\u2019s FACS department said it would review the report and consider its recommendations. The government had programs and measures in place to \u201ccombat domestic and family violence and deal with its consequences\u201d, she said. A Victorian DHHS spokesman said evictions were considered an \u201coption of last resort\u201d and that family violence victims were helped by being transferred to new or temporary accomodation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
