Liverpool trail Manchester United by seven points before their early clash at Anfield on Saturday having won once in seven matches in all competitions, albeit while producing stronger performances than results would suggest. Klopp\u2019s prospects of delivering a first league championship to Liverpool since 1990 have also not been helped by the financial power and early\u2011season form shown by the two Manchester clubs. But having returned Champions League football to Anfield in his first full season in charge, Klopp remains convinced Liverpool \u201care on a good way\u201d and can compete with wealthier rivals. He would not be Liverpool manager, he insisted, if he suspected otherwise. \u201cIn the moment when I think we cannot be successful, and there is only consolation, I go,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWhy should I be here as some kind of caretaker until the world creates a manager who can be more successful? That makes no sense. I am really convinced. Other managers have different ways to do it, other clubs have different ways to do it. We have our way. I don\u2019t think I am the perfect manager, I only think I am the perfect fit for this club. And I feel already much more responsible than maybe I should. I don\u2019t even think about going from my side or saying \u2018That\u2019s it\u2019. I really think we are on the right way. \u201cDoing things like this [spending money] makes it more likely. Yes, we need to be a little bit luckier but to do that you have to carry on working. I know we are on a good way. If we could start again now by bringing me in, I would still have the same fire and the same passion, absolutely no problem. I know people don\u2019t want to wait. We cannot change this. If you don\u2019t want to wait, don\u2019t wait. It\u2019s like, if you have a really good situation in your private life, then enjoy it. But if your neighbour has a better situation, does that mean you can\u2019t enjoy your own situation? \u2018But he\u2019s got one more car, he gets to go on one extra holiday.\u2019 It\u2019s not about others. It\u2019s about us becoming happy.\u201d Klopp admitted he did not open a bottle of champagne to toast his two-year anniversary as Liverpool manager last Sunday as he is \u201cnot overly happy\u201d with the team\u2019s results. Though he cautioned: \u201cIf they [Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool\u2019s owner] sacked me now, there would not be a lot of managers who would do the job better than I do. I don\u2019t think I am perfect but, as long as 98% of Liverpudlians are behind us, then we are on the right way and we will succeed.\u201d In 24 months at Liverpool the two\u2011times Bundesliga winner has spent \u00a3148m on new players and recouped \u00a3116m. His opposite number at United, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, has spent \u00a3306m and recouped \u00a341m in 17 months at Old Trafford. Yet Klopp insists the financial disparity is not reflected in Liverpool\u2019s quality or ambition. He said: \u201cCan we dominate them for the next 20 years without spending the same amount of money? Probably not. But can we still be there? Yes, of course we can and we want to force this. \u201cWe want to be consistent, constantly at our high level and improve it. Even when we lose a player in the future we want to bring in other players. That\u2019s the benefit of a long-term project. I know the owners are not in doubt about me, about us, about anything. It\u2019s really OK but of course we know we have to deliver. \u201cAt Newcastle I was close [to losing it after the 1-1 draw]. It was too much for me for a second. It felt unfair after the game. We were the better side, we had more chances. They had one chance and scored. A journalist asked me: \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a fair result?\u2019 I said \u2019What do you think?\u2019 When he said \u2018Yes\u2019, I was close to saying, \u2018Come on, get up!\u2019 As a human being I\u2019m not proud of this. When I went out, I thought, \u2018Come on, go back, shake hands. It\u2019s not his fault ...\u2019 But it\u2019s how the world is. They aren\u2019t interested. It\u2019s about results. Deliver: we know that.\u201d Klopp predicted United \u201cwill not be as passive\u201d as they were in the goalless draw at Anfield last season. He also admitted Liverpool\u2019s collective confidence suffered more than it should have done after the 5-0 defeat at Manchester City on 9 September when Sadio Man\u00e9, who will miss the next six weeks with a hamstring injury, was sent off. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cWe want a situation to create confidence. Against City we were the better team before we had 10 men and then they scored five and something like 40 goals in the next two weeks. We took the knock and thought, \u2018Shit, we conceded five,\u2019 but it was not that bad. We were the better side in all the games after that and did not win, except at Leicester. The big challenge is stay confident and play football. I am ready for this and the boys are ready for this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
