The arrival of the Kirov Opera for a fortnight's residency promises some recompense; the company has brought six Verdi productions as well as the Requiem and launched its season last night with Un Ballo in Maschera. Launched, though, is a rather upbeat description of what turned out to be a desperately disappointing occasion. If the great Verdi tradition of the Kirov that has been hyped so much in anticipation of this visit really does survive in St Petersburg, it certainly was not on show in this opening production. The staging by Andrei Konchalovsky is just five months old, but could date back 50 years. The massive and expensive-looking sets by Ezio Frigerio (costumes by his usual partner Franca Squarciapino) are leadenly naturalistic: the Kirov opts for the Boston location of the opera, which Verdi and his librettist hurriedly cobbled together when they realised that Un Ballo in Maschera in its original Swedish setting, culminating in the murder of Gustav III, would never get past the censors, so the sets are littered with the hulks of sailing boats in the first two acts, gloomy interiors and a tawdry ballroom in the third. The direction of the principals is risible; this is opera as the art of coarse acting, in which the chorus sways in time to the music at the slightest provocation, a soloist indicates his anguish by clutching desperately at his heart, and no one can think of dying without rolling at least halfway across the stage. It is gruesomely terrible, and for once in a Kirov show even the standard of the singing fails to redeem the dramatic shortcomings. With the exception of the ever reliable Larissa Diadkova as Ulrica there were no outstanding voices on parade; the tenor Ivan Momirov was Riccardo (aka Gustav), announced as suffering from flu before curtain up, and chopping his phrases so brutally there was no doubt something was wrong; Sergei Murzaev was a sonorous but dull Renato (Ankarstrom), Olga Sergeeva a tremulous Amelia, while the intensely winsome Oscar, Svetlana Trofonova, should have been told by somebody that she was supposed to be playing a boy. Valery Gergiev's conducting was sometimes electrifying, but more often routine. The audience cheered to the echo, but if you had paid \u00a3175 for a stalls seat the last thing you would want to admit was that this was second rate. Further performance tonight.
