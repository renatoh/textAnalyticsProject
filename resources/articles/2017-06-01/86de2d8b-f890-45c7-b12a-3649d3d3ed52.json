Eighteen of America\u2019s leading technology executives \u2013 including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet \u2013 convened at the White House Monday for the summit. \u201cGovernment needs to catch up with the technology revolution,\u201d said Trump. \u201cAmerica should be the global leader in government technology just as we are in every other aspect, and we are going to start our big edge again in technology \u2013 such an important industry.\u201d The tech leaders spent four hours meeting officials including vice-president Mike Pence, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross before meeting with the president. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, was also present. They discussed modernizing the government\u2019s technological infrastructure, cutting fraud and government costs and improving services for taxpayers. The White House believes these measures could save up to $1tn over 10 years. \u201cTogether we will unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before,\u201d said White House senior adviser and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, before the sessions started. Kushner highlighted some astonishing examples of outdated federal IT infrastructure, including the fact that the defense department still uses 8in floppy disks on some of its legacy systems. He also mentioned that civilian agencies maintain more than 1.6m email addresses per month using on-premise servers at an average cost of $20-per-user per month. Switching to cloud-based email services could reduce these costs down to $3-per-user per month, he said. \u201cOur goal here is simple: we are here to improve the day to day lives of the average citizen. That\u2019s a core promise and we are keeping it,\u201d said Kushner. \u201cWe will foster a new set of startups focused on gov-tech, and be a global leader in the field making government more transparent and responsive to citizens\u2019 needs.\u201d Code for America founder Jennifer Pahlka, who served as deputy chief technology officer under the Obama administration and attended the meeting, said that Kushner \u201csaid the right words\u201d but that the strategy built on Obama-era plans. \u201cBecause they have the benefit of a congress that\u2019s friendly to this administration they have the ability to pursue some regulation changes that some of my colleagues who worked on under Obama wanted,\u201d she said. However, the impact of modernizing the delivery of public services will be limited if the budgets for the underlying services are slashed by the Trump administration. She cited the \u201cvery deep cuts\u201d to Medicaid as an example. \u201cSome of the budget cuts are inconsistent with the idea of making the government work better for all Americans equally,\u201d she said. The tech CEOs were also pushing their own agendas, according to Recode. Bezos, for example, called on the government to take advantage of the type of commercial technology that Amazon sells. Palantir CEO Alex Karp said that big data analysis, the kind Palantir offers, could help stop fraudulent federal spending. Apple\u2019s Tim Cook wanted coding to be made a requirement in schools. This was the first meeting of the American Technology Council since the president announced its creation in an executive order signed on 11 May. Within the order, which builds on plans laid out by the Obama administration, Trump announced the creation of the council, whose mission is to \u201ccoordinate the vision strategy and direction for the federal government\u2019s use of information technology and the delivery of services through information technology\u201d. The council was given 90 days to come up with a plan to transition antiquated, fragmented systems across government to either \u201cone or more consolidated network architectures\u201d or \u201cshared IT services, including email, cloud and cybersecurity services\u201d. Other members of the council include: Ajay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard; Safra Catz, co-CEO of Oracle; Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir; Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel; Ginni Rometty, CEO of IBM; and Peter Thiel. The council is led by Chris Liddell, a top aide to Trump and the former chief financial officer of Microsoft. Notably absent from the meeting was Facebook \u2013 neither Mark Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg were able to attend due to \u201cscheduling conflicts\u201d. It was the only one out of the top-five most valuable companies in the US to not have a representative at the meeting. The meeting comes at a time when a number of people in the tech world have chosen to distance themselves from Trump after he withdrew from the Paris climate accord. Elon Musk, founder and CEO of Tesla and Space X, announced on Twitter: \u201cAm departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\u201d Before that Uber\u2019s embattled CEO Travis Kalanick left Trump\u2019s business advisory council after the company faced criticism for working closely with the Trump administration and for its response to the White House\u2019s travel ban affecting people from seven Muslim majority countries. In January, the social media meme #DeleteUber exploded online after the ride-sharing company was accused of exploiting the travel ban for commercial gain. In protest at the travel ban the New York Taxi Workers Alliance called on its members to avoid JFK airport. However, Uber flouted the strike although removed surge pricing from journeys to and from the airport. It was far from Uber\u2019s most egregious undertakings, but enough to give arch rival Lyft a 7% boost in users. Uber apologized for the misunderstanding and Kalanick sent a memo to all of Uber\u2019s staff. \u201cThere are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
