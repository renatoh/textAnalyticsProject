Just look at Neymar\u2019s dad", "bodyText": "The football world was rocked last week by the news that the Brazilian player Neymar has been sold to Paris Saint-Germain for a head-exploding sum of \u00a3198m, a figure almost eight times larger than the GDP of the island nation of Tuvalu. Had he been writing today, the poet John Donne may have had to update his assertion that \u201cno man is an island\u201d to the slightly less catchy \u201cno man is an island, but a man might be worth more than an island if he can kick a ball into a net well enough\u201d. On Saturday morning, pictures were circulating of the cheque that sealed the deal. Perhaps the biggest shock of this whole thing is that PSG paid by cheque. I genuinely didn\u2019t know that people still used cheques. I had simply assumed that they would do a Bacs transfer. I thought the chequebook had gone the way of the CD, the landline and the concept of liberal democracy; outmoded and unnecessary in the fast-paced Trumpian dystopia of 2017. To compound my confusion, the cheque they used is just a normal-size cheque. If you\u2019re going to smash a transfer record at least have the decency to get one of those enormous novelty cheques like we used to have in the 1990s. Where is your sense of spectacle, PSG? The deal has been expedited by Neymar\u2019s adviser, who, as has been reported in various news outlets, is \u201ccoincidentally his father\u201d. I would suggest that there is no coincidence involved here at all. I\u2019d argue it was very much deliberate. I\u2019m not sure Neymars Snr and Jnr arrived at work and saw the other one and exclaimed: \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought it was another Neymar \u2013 small world!\u201d Neymar Snr and others, including the agent Pini Zahavi, stand to make around \u00a334m from the deal. Inspired by this, my father suggested he become my adviser. I suggested that the numbers might not be as astronomical. Professional footballers tend to operate in a different financial realm to critically acclaimed (a phrase used out of politeness, instead of the more accurate \u201clargely unknown\u201d) standups. He refused to let the matter lie, saying that in order to \u201cbe like Neymar, you have to think like Neymar\u201d. I informed him of what I was being paid for writing this article. He went away and calculated his percentage, before returning and suggesting that maybe now was \u201cnot the right time for a career change\u201d for him, but that we should \u201cstay in touch\u201d. The reality is that football hasn\u2019t gone mad. It made that journey several years ago and there is no sign of the bubble bursting. For many of us, football is both a source of frustration and absolute euphoria. Knowing his transfer is evidence that the game is a bloated monstrosity sadly will not detract from the simple pleasure of Neymar\u2019s seemingly effortless, elegant genius. We cannot bear to look, but we cannot bear to turn away. The size of the global audiences for these gifted island nations is still growing. Until that changes, expect more giant cheques to be written. In the meantime, I\u2019m off to find my dad and see if he\u2019ll reconsider being my adviser. After all, if it\u2019s good enough for the Neymars, it\u2019s good enough for the Kumars.
