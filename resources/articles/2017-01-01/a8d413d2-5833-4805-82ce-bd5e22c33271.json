The second was on Monday when, at his last official White House function, he welcomed the Chicago Cubs baseball team, winners of the World Series for the first time in 108 years. The comparison was less trivial than first appeared. Obama noted that he has hosted more than 50 winning teams from baseball, basketball, American football and soccer during his eight years in office. He has always appeared to relish the break from the heavy burdens of managing the economy and foreign policy. They have typically been jovial occasions, exercises in charm and soft power, and a tacit acknowledgement that more people watch the Super Bowl than any presidential debate. At a time when democratic norms are under extraordinary stress, sport remains intact in the social fabric. Obama spoke in the East Room, which was packed with hundreds of people, many wearing Cubs baseball caps, shirts and jackets. \u201cIt is worth remembering,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause sometimes people wonder, \u2018Well, why are you spending time on sports when there\u2019s other stuff going on?\u2019 that throughout our history sports has had this power to bring us together even when the country\u2019s divided. \u201cSports has changed attitudes and culture in ways that seem subtle but ultimately made us think differently about ourselves and who we were. It is a game and a celebration but there is a direct line between Jackie Robinson and me standing here.\u201d Robinson broke the colour barrier in 1947 by becoming the first black player in Major League Baseball, playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers. With the Cubs players and staff behind him, the president continued: \u201cI was in my home town of Chicago on Tuesday for my farewell address and I said, \u2018Sometimes it\u2019s not enough just to change laws, you\u2019ve gotta change hearts,\u2019 and sports has a way sometimes of changing hearts in a way that politics or business doesn\u2019t. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just a matter of us being able to escape and relax from the difficulties of our days, but sometimes it also speaks to something better in us. \u201cAnd when you see this group of folks of different shades and different backgrounds coming from different communities and neighbourhoods all across the country and then playing as one team and playing the right way and celebrating each other and being joyous in that, that tells us a little something about what America is and what America can be.\u201d It was therefore fitting to celebrate the Cubs in the White House a day after the anniversary of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s birth, he said. The Cubs won their first World Series title since 1908 by defeating the Cleveland Indians in November. Within hours, Obama asked the team on Twitter if they wanted to visit before his term ended. Cheers of \u201cLet\u2019s Go Cubbies!\u201d broke out when the team walked in. Just four days before he packs his bags and moves out of the White House to make way for Donald Trump, Obama appeared at ease and even lighthearted. There were quips about \u201cthe audacity of hope\u201d and \u201cyes, we can\u201d as he went into standup comedian mode. He even turned satirical at the expense of the Democratic National Committee while praising the Cubs general manager, Theo Epstein. \u201cTheo, as you know, his job is to quench droughts. Eighty-six years in Boston\u201d \u2013 when the Red Sox won the World Series in 2004 \u2013 \u201c108 in Chicago, he takes the reins of an organisation that\u2019s wandering in the wilderness, he delivers them to the promised land. I\u2019ve talked to him about being DNC chair.\u201d There was laughter and applause. \u201cBut he\u2019s decided, wisely, to stick to baseball.\u201d The audience included Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, and ex-chief strategist David Axelrod, who was wearing a \u201cMake Chicago Great Again\u201d T-shirt under his suit jacket, and Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, a Trump supporter who will become his deputy secretary of commerce. It was, of course, apt that Obama\u2019s farewell should involve a team from Chicago. Less conveniently, the president supports the rival Chicago White Sox. His wife Michelle is a lifelong Cub. Obama said the first lady had not come to a single event celebrating a championship team at the White House, until Monday. She shook hands with the players and told them how much the Cubs winning meant to her. \u201cShe remembers coming home from school,\u201d Obama said, \u201cand her dad would be watching the Cubs game and the bond and the family, the meaning that the Cubs had for her in terms of connecting with her father, and why it meant so much to her. \u201cI almost choked up listening to it and it spoke, I think, to how people feel about this organisation and it\u2019s been passed on, generation after generation, and it\u2019s more than just sports.\u201d Obama also noted that the last time the Cubs won the World Series, Teddy Roosevelt was president. Roosevelt\u2019s portrait gazed down from the East Room wall. Epstein offered Obama a \u201cmidnight pardon\u201d for his allegiance to the White Sox and welcomed him into the Cubs family. First baseman Anthony Rizzo gave the president two \u201c44\u201d jerseys with Obama\u2019s name on them. The Cubs also gave him a \u201c44\u201d from the Wrigley Field scoreboard and a \u201cW\u201d flag signed by the team. Epstein said he hoped the flag would fly at the Obama Presidential Library when it is built in Chicago. \u201cLet me just say first of all,\u201d Obama said, charitably embracing his inner Cub: \u201cBest swag I\u2019ve gotten as president.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
