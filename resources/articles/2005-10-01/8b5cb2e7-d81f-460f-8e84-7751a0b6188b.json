This was possibly a relief because, when Beckham arrived here two years ago, it caused such a stir that Juan Carlos Ferrero, the Spaniard who was then No1 in the world, had to fiddle around at the back of the court for several minutes before being able to continue his match. In the short time since then Nadal has become a bigger hero than Ferrero and the 18-year-old French Open champion will attain special status here if he goes on to win Spain's most important tournament despite medical advice which suggested a risk to his fitness. Nadal looked livelier last night during a 6-2, 6-4 win over Tommy Robredo, his movement more relaxed than against Victor Hanescu, although the narrow black strips were still there around those troublesome knees. \"My knees hurt a little bit in the morning but once I had got going they were better than yesterday. I feel stronger,\" said Nadal. \"Of course I didn't mind David Beckham missed my match. I spoke to him afterwards, just as I spoke to him in the dressing room after the match on Wednesday night.\" Beckham, the scorer of a crucial goal in the Champions League two days ago arrived only in time to see the two South Americans, Guillermo Coria and Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez. Nadal today plays Radek Stepanek, the conqueror of Tim Henman. Meanwhile Andy Roddick followed his rant at the umpire Lars Graff, for correctly refusing to overrule a line decision during the American's unexpected 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 defeat by Ivo Karlovic with a call for tennis to use Hawk-Eye for tight calls. \"We have technology of cameras at every single angle. Let's take the human element out. Umpires get nervous just like we do. So, if it's there, why not use it?\" Roddick asked. \"Plus it would be fun. Can you imagine if you had a flag in your bag that you could throw for an instant replay once or twice a set? It would add a whole 'nother element of excitement to it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
