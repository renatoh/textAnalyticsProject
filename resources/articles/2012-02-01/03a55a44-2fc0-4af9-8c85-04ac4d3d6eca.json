The Ireland full-back, who was fit to take part in training on Tuesday after recovering from a groin strain, said Ireland were more confident than they were when the match should have been played because they are now travelling to the French capital buoyed by victory over Italy rather than deflated by their opening round defeat against Wales. \"We're in a much better place than maybe we were two or three weeks ago,\" Kearney, a 2009 Lion, said. \"Tries win games and to score five of them against Italy was really pleasing. We're starting to get more clinical in the green zone area of play, and while we were too guilty of playing too much in our own half, it was pleasing that when we did get into the right areas we took our opportunities.\" Kearney said Ireland would not react to their poor record in Paris by trying too hard. \"I don't think we need to do something special,\" he went on. \"That's where we fall down sometimes when we play in France. We look at our record and it doesn't fill us with confidence, so maybe we feel as though we have to try something different there. \"Where we have always fallen down in France is that we've had a very poor start, giving up a big lead 20-30 minutes into the game. When you're playing a team of the calibre of France you can't do that and expect to win. We have to start strongly on Sunday.\" Scotland face Ireland in Dublin a week on Saturday. Their full-back Rory Lamont, who suffered a broken leg against France on Sunday, has been ruled out for the rest of the season after undergoing surgery. Dan Parks, the Scotland fly-half who retired from international rugby earlier this month, is joining Connacht from Cardiff Blues in the summer after signing a two-year contract. Continuing the exodus of players from the Welsh regions is the former Wales hooker Rhys Thomas, who is joining Wasps. The South Africa prop Tendai Mtawarira is in hospital having tests after being admitted with a heart complaint. The Sharks team doctor, Ewoudt van der Linde, said: \"The condition is hereditary and is not too serious. There is a new procedure where the heart is treated with lasers and we expect the Beast to be ready for South Africa's first international in June.\" Sale expect to know within two weeks whether Danny Cipriani, the former England fly-half who is playing for Melbourne Rebels, will be joining them next season. The wing Mark Cueto said: \"The club have made some fantastic signings and they are looking at bringing in a couple more. Cips is one of them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
