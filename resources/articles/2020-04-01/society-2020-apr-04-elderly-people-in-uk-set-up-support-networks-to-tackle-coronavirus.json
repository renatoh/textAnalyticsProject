Jean Coops, 85, from London, was asked by her vicar to keep in touch with some elderly parishioners from her local church, aged between 75 and 91. \u201cI have a list of six people to keep in touch with but I expect the list will grow in the next few weeks as the lockdown drags on and the elderly feel more vulnerable and isolated,\u201d she said. \u201cI ring everyone on my list once every few days. I ask how they are and whether there\u2019s anything they need \u2014 although of course, there\u2019s nothing I can really do because I\u2019m as old as they are and so can\u2019t go and do shopping for them.\u201d Coops said once she had called the people on her list a couple of times, they began ringing her back to check she was OK too. \u201cSo we\u2019ve become a mutual support group,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s rather nice and cheering, us older people all looking out for each other.\u201d Dr Geoff Foot, also in his 80s, emails a joke out to his network of friends every morning. \u201cI do it to motivate and cheer them up a bit. It seems to be working as I now have a bank of about 40 jokes ready to send out over the coming weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these jokes have been supplied by members and so, in a sense, I\u2019m acting as a focal point for distribution.\u201d Brian, 93, a car enthusiast in Birmingham, suggested that 18 of his friends, aged 88 to 103, set up a telephone rota. \u201cWe\u2019re all linked by our love of cars and have been going to events together for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cI suggested we set up a system, so we all speak to at least one other person in our group each day. We\u2019re all facing different stresses. Some of us are elderly carers and others are alone, with no family to keep in touch. \u201cAll we can do is keep each other cheerful and, if someone isn\u2019t answering their phone, will alert the emergency services.\u201d Nicola, 97, from Glasgow responded to a leaflet posted through her door from a local group of volunteers offering support, by ringing the group and asking if she could be a dedicated telephone support worker. \u201cI just wanted to do something to help,\u201d she said. \u201cI also understand the anxieties and fears of the older members of our community at a visceral level because I\u2019m old too. I live alone, I am scared about the future and worry that I\u2019m not going to have enough food and medication to see me through..\u201d Bob, 76, in Newcastle asked his local volunteer group if he could help with the logistics of dispensing aid to all the elderly people in the community. \u201cI\u2019ve spent hours drawing up online spreadsheets, working out who needs what and who can do it. I was pretty good on the computer before, but this has really made me into a computer whizz,\u201d he said. Geraldine and George, 87 and 89 respectively, have set up an email group and Zoom quiz for their group of similarly aged friends. \u201cGeraldine and I now spend our week collecting together lists of uplifting news stories from around the world. Then we email it out on Fridays,\u201d said George. \u201cWe then spend the weekend writing a quiz for our friends and then we all hold a Zoom meeting on Mondays and pretend we\u2019re in our local, having a pub quiz. We even joke about whose turn it is to go to the bar and buy the next round.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
