The individuals received alerts saying they were among more than 100 human rights campaigners whose phones were believed to have been hacked using malware sold by NSO Group, an Israeli cyberweapons company. WhatsApp launched an unprecedented lawsuit against the surveillance company earlier this week, claiming it had discovered more than 1,400 of its users were targeted by NSO technology in a two-week period in May. Filed in a Californian court, the lawsuit described the alleged attacks as an \u201cunmistakeable pattern of abuse\u201d that violated US law. Two pro-democracy campaigners from Morocco who received the WhatsApp warnings said any use of the sophisticated malware, known as Pegasus, against them would be a serious violation of their rights. \u201cI am a big proponent of democratisation in the Middle East in general and in Morocco in particular,\u201d said Aboubakr Jama\u00ef, a campaigner and former journalist who lives in France. \u201cThe Moroccan regime is certainly less nefarious than, say, the Syrian regime, but it\u2019s nonetheless an authoritarian regime who can use some despicable means against its opponents, as it did.\u201d Jama\u00ef, who has gained international recognition for his groundbreaking work as a publisher who faced jail for his journalism, said he was contemplating his own separate legal action against NSO, and would consider a possible class-action suit with other alleged victims. Abdellatif El Hamamouchi, a 22-year-old human rights activist in Rabat who has been campaigning for justice for the jailed newspaper editor Taoufik Bouachrine, also received the alert. Hamamouchi said: \u201cI already strongly believed that I was under surveillance from the Moroccan authorities, but it surprised me that these attacks were coming from abroad, and they involved an Israeli company. The action taken by WhatsApp against NSO is a positive thing. \u201cI have not heard from NSO since I was informed about this, but I would regard any explanation they could give as worthless.\u201d At least six Rwandan dissidents have also come forward with claims they were targeted by Pegasus, according to interviews with the Financial Times. Among them was Faustin Rukundo, a British citizen who is a member of a Rwandan opposition group and lives in exile and in fear of Rwanda\u2019s security services. In India, 17 people, including human rights activists, scholars and journalists, are said to have confirmed to Scroll.in that they were targeted by spyware on WhatsApp. NSO has said it will contest \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d the WhatsApp lawsuit, but declined to comment further. It has insisted it cannot comment on its customers, or the people who have received alerts from WhatsApp. The company said it investigated all serious allegations against it and had recently adopted a new human rights policy. \u201cThe sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists. It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe consider any other use of our products than to prevent serious crime and terrorism a misuse, which is contractually prohibited. We take action if we detect any misuse.\u201d However, NSO has faced a chorus of criticism because of the alleged abuse of its technology. It is widely reported to have sold its spyware to authoritarian regimes including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The WhatsApp lawsuit also claims human rights activists and lawyers were not the only intended victims of the cyber-attacks, with unnamed diplomats and senior government officials also targeted. Although WhatsApp declined to provide more details about the claims, Reuters reported on Thursday that the targeted officials were from \u201cmultiple\u201d US-allied countries. Pressure on NSO grew on Friday when the Israeli security cabinet minister, Ze\u2019ev Elkin, insisted the government had nothing to do with the company. In an interview on Tel Aviv radio, he described NSO \u201cas a private player\u201d and said if anyone had done anything wrong, \u201cthen the justice system here and in other countries will throw the book at them\u201d. The Indian government has called on WhatsApp to submit a detailed report by next week on claims that many Indians were targeted. Some NSO employees complained on social media after Facebook \u2013 which owns WhatsApp \u2013 appeared to have shut down accounts of employees at the cyberweapons company. One referred to Facebook as \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest privacy violator\u201d. \u201cFacebook, you never cease to amaze me,\u201d wrote one executive in a publicly available post on LinkedIn, which was liked by several other NSO employees. \u201cYesterday, both of my personal Facebook and Instagram profiles were intentionally disabled by the world\u2019s greatest privacy violator in the history of mankind, aka Facebook.\u201d NSO declined to comment on the remarks. Facebook also declined to comment, but pointed to the WhatsApp lawsuit, which urged the court to order \u201ca permanent injunction enjoining and restraining (NSO) and their agents, servants, employees from accessing or attempting to access WhatsApp\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s service, platform and computer systems.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
