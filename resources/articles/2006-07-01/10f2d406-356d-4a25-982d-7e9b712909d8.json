Yet buried within this 40-minute mismatch of breathy, slow-burn folk-chanson and dated electronica - the worn-vinyl beats beloved of yesteryear's samplers; the squelches, rumbles and other digestive noises Bj\u00f6rk raised to an artistic apogee on the wonderful Homogenic - is one terrific song and a few near misses. The chorus of The Last Trick rises on a thermal of triumphant wistfulness of which Madeleine Peyroux would be proud; the woodwind-driven This Momentous Day struggles inside a cacophonous metal arrangement; and such fragments as the micro-song Yes and the fade-out to Sleep all frustratingly suggest an engagingly dreamy songthrush who should be freed from an ill-fitting cage of her own misguided construction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
