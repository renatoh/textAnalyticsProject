Lee, Altrincham\u2019s manager, and his son Jordan, a ball-playing midfielder, have already helped slay League One opposition this season, with a 1-0 win over Barnsley in the first round at Moss Lane. Altrincham may be a part-time operation who started the weekend 18th in the Vanarama National League but no professional club wants to hear their name drawn as their next FA Cup opponent. Barnsley became league victim No17 thanks to a combination of the right attitude and a willingness to keep to the style demanded by the manager. This is the strategy Colchester, who are in transition after the manager Tony Humes departed 10 days ago, will have to negate on Sunday too. As Sinnott Jr says: \u201cYou stick to your game-plan, you go about your business the way the gaffer tells you to, how he wants you to play. You always up your game, especially against a league team, and you need that bit of luck like I felt we had in the first round.\u201d The \u201cgaffer\u201d is Jordan\u2019s father, of course. He signed for him in February after leaving Huddersfield Town, for whom he was a substitute in the league twice, while also making six loan appearances at Altrincham and 10 with Bury. Both father and son are careful to keep their football relationship professional. Jordan had to win through a trial before Sinnott decided to take him to the Robins on a permanent basis. \u201cHe treated me like any other player that was coming in and looking to sign for the club,\u201d Sinnott Jr says. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it or want it any other way.\u201d His father concurs: \u201cHe\u2019s just another player. He wouldn\u2019t be at this club if he couldn\u2019t do a job because that\u2019s on my head then \u2013 I\u2019m very straight on the line in how I manage. Yes, he carries the same surname as the gaffer, but when he first came to the club I referred to him as No26 because it has to be that way. It\u2019s harder for him because everyone judges him.\u201d There is, though, scope for banter. The 21-year-old Sinnott Jr shares the same moniker his father acquired during his playing days as a tough defender. \u201cI joined Huddersfield when I was 15 and one of my coaches slaughtered me with my dad\u2019s nickname \u2013 from that I got \u2018Sinbad\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cMy old man keeps hammering me, saying: \u2018Get your own nickname\u2019.\u201d Altrincham may be only eight points above the Conference relegation zone but their first-round victims, Barnsley, are bottom of League One, and Colchester only two points better off. Sinnott Jr is taking nothing for granted, however.\u201cIt will be a tough game, with them being a league side, I think it\u2019ll be very similar to Barnsley,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir league form is not far off. We\u2019ll be the underdogs again and hopefully we can cause another upset. I don\u2019t see why not. If we play the ball like we can, getting it down, passing it and hopefully cause them a few problems, you never know with the Cup. Anything can happen, like it did in the last round.\u201d And as it did on the 16 previous occasions before then when Altrincham shocked league opponents. Tranmere were the first, in 1921-22. Then came Rochdale (65-66), Hartlepool (73-74), Scunthorpe (74-75), Crewe and Rotherham (79-80), Scunthorpe (80-81), Sheffield United and York (81-82), Rochdale (82-83), Blackpool (84-85 and 85-86), Birmingham (85-86), Lincoln (88-89), Chester (92-93), and Wigan (94-95). It is a remarkable string of scalps. From 1979 to 1982 Altrincham reached the third round four times. In 1975 and 1979 third-round replays were forced with Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. Yet before last month\u2019s win over Barnsley 21 years had passed since their last giant-killing, when the Latics were knocked out with a 1-0 win, so the Sinnotts can be proud of helping the club to end the wait. At Colchester the manager will again tap into this heritage. \u201cYes, but we won\u2019t go overboard with it. The previous one [giantkilling] was in the mid-90s which shows how prolific the club was because they still hold the record for knocking out league clubs,\u201d he says. Sinnott amassed 613 appearances in all competitions in an 18-year professional career with Bradford, Huddersfield and Watford among others, and played all 90 minutes of Watford\u2019s 2-0 FA Cup final defeat by Everton in 1984, though memories of that May day are hazy. \u201cYou have snippets of it \u2013 snippets of the build-up, not so much the action,\u201d Sinnott says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a tape of the game \u2013 a couple of things stand out. When you walk up the tunnel of the old Wembley, it was quite a fair tunnel, and you couldn\u2019t see the pitch until halfway. And when we walked out half an hour before I felt more nervous than I did for the actual game.\u201d He will, similarly, be encouraging his side to be brave against the U\u2019s on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the players to make sure they go for it. Give it a go, in the right controlled manner. We\u2019re not going to be like the Californian gold rush, try to score five or six goals. They\u2019ve done it against Barnsley,\u201d he says. \u201cThis club is no lover of reputations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
