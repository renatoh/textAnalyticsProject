West Ham, who are three points above the bottom three before Friday\u2019s crucial home game against Watford, have fallen well short in their ambition of breaking into the elite since leaving Upton Park in 2016 and Moyes believes they must be prepared to build patiently if they stay up. The manager\u2019s view is that starts with hard graft, warning that the club have too often been viewed as a soft touch by opposing sides. \u201cThe key is for us is to make sure we are a Premier League club and see if we can continue that,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cOf all the things that I heard in lockdown the most interesting came from the Archbishop of York. He said: \u2018Promise less and deliver more.\u2019 That has to be a little bit of West Ham. \u201cWe have to make sure we deliver. We cannot keep promising that we will finish in the high, high positions. We need to build the club. We suddenly can\u2019t go from this position to way up the Premier League. I hope we can but we need to be careful that we don\u2019t promise too much, which we can\u2019t deliver.\u201d Moyes, who returned for a second stint at West Ham after replacing Manuel Pellegrini in December, faced Watford when he began his first spell in November 2017. Watford won 2-0 and Moyes was alarmed when Marko Arnautovic, who left West Ham last summer, went off with an injury. \u201cThe biggest memory is that Marko Arnautovic came off with a sore finger,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought: \u2018My goodness, what is this I have got here?\u2019 I want to get away from a West Ham team that is soft. I want them to be harder and tougher as we are in a relegation battle.\u201d Moyes admitted he viewed West Ham as easy prey when he managed Everton, though he argued the current side are capable of mixing flair with grit. The former Manchester United and Sunderland manager was asked about the so-called West Ham Way \u2013 an idea supporters celebrate with chants of \u201cWest Ham United, we play on the floor\u201d \u2013 and insisted he was committed to an expansive approach. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an awful lot of good football players,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cThat is the way I am going and that is the way we tend to play. When I said \u2018hard\u2019 it was getting away from the inconsistent West Ham; the flaky West Ham. I want us to get away from being a team where you think you can roll them over and catch them on an off day. I want more consistency.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
