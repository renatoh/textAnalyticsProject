Four decades on, the brightly coloured 3D puzzle is gaining cult status once more, this time among a younger generation, who are sharing videos of themselves solving it on social media \u2013 and even competing in \u201cspeedcubing\u201d events. Now two British teenagers are set to take part in the final of the Rubik\u2019s Cube world cup, which takes place virtually this week. They\u2019ll be attempting to beat the current record holder Yusheng Du who can solve the puzzle in a jaw-dropping 3.47 seconds. One of the two hopefuls is 18-year-old Chris Mills, who has become one of the UK\u2019s top speedcubers \u2013 the name given to those who can solve the Rubik\u2019s Cube at lightning speed. His record while competing is seven seconds although at home near Eastbourne he can do it in 3.98 seconds. Asked what the appeal was, especially when there are so many other distractions for teenagers, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s great because I can do it whenever and wherever I am. If I\u2019ve got no internet, I can do this instead. Once you start, you notice yourself getting faster and faster. That\u2019s very satisfying. To keep beating my record is what has kept me going for six years.\u201d Mills has also become part of a growing community that shares tips over Facebook and WhatsApp. This is how he met George Scholey, also 18, whom he will be competing against. Scholey, who is studying at Queen Mary University, is from Northampton and like Mills has been solving Rubik\u2019s Cubes since he was a young teen. His biggest concern is nerves. \u201cI do get nervous because everyone is watching. My hands start shaking and obviously, it\u2019s all down to this dexterity so you can\u2019t really let that slide.\u201d Scholey believes the Rubik\u2019s Cube is making a cult comeback among young people thanks to Youtube and Netflix documentary The Speed Cubers, which followed Max Park and Feliks Zemdegs as they prepared for last year\u2019s championship. Films of TikTok users solving the puzzle have also become popular, and Jurassic World actor Chris Pratt impressed his Instagram followers and made news when he managed to complete the cube in under a minute during lockdown. He later admitted he had been practising for a year. The pandemic could also have played a part in boosting its popularity among the young, according to the puzzle\u2019s maker. Rubik\u2019s chief executive, Christoph Bettin said views and content on social media have increased significantly during lockdown and sales have risen by double digits in all major markets. It is estimated that the Rubik\u2019s Cube is played by more than a billion people, and 480 million units of Rubik\u2019s Cubes and merchandise are expected to be sold globally this year alone, Bettin added. He said: \u201cFace-to-face events are on hold for reasons of safety and social distancing \u2026 and this change in circumstance has seen a massive growth of interest in puzzles and games, together with increased nostalgia. \u201cIn addition, there has been exceptional interest in solving the cube during lockdown as the popularity in puzzles generally has soared.\u201d Ern\u0151 Rubik, the cube\u2019s inventor, told the Observer the reason it\u2019s still so popular 40 years on is that it \u201cspeaks to the noblest, universally shared human characteristics: curiosity, playfulness, problem-solving and intelligence\u201d. He added: \u201cNo matter your social background, colour of your skin or gender, the cube encapsulates the puzzle of us all. Young people, in particular, seem to be captivated with solving the cube at speed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
