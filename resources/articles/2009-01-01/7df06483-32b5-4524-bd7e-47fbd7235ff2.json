The Irish duo of Kevin Doyle and Noel Hunt scored within a minute of each other, adding to Chris Armstrong's first-half goal and then Leroy Lita marked his return from his loan spell at Norwich City with his first goal at the Madejski Stadium since February, 2007. Three forwards on the mark had the Reading manager luxuriating in his conundrum: \"It's no headache, I can assure you of that. [There is] Shane Long as well, who has been the best substitute for us for years,\" said Coppell. \"It's a nice position to be in. It's uncomfortable for the four strikers, which is what you want. Doyle and Noel Hunt know that they're under pressure, the boys are behind them \u2013 Leroy wants to play, Shane wants to play.\" The manager's four strikers have 35 goals between them this season. But it was a full-back, Armstrong, who broke the deadlock on 38 minutes, his clean left-foot volley from an acute angle beating Scott Loach at his near post. Watford had plenty of possession in the first half but lacked width going forward \u2013 proof perhaps that, despite starting his coaching career at Reading, Watford's manager Brendan Rodgers learned his trade under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea. Watford withstood the Royals' a barrage early in the second half but, as in the first half they were hobbled by their lack of width and a paucity of numbers in their opponents' penalty area when the ball made its rare and fleeting visits. Noel Hunt, however, was in the box when his brother Stephen crossed from a wide position and he dispatched Jimmy Kebe's nod down with an excellent swivel and shot. A minute later it was 3-0, Doyle scoring the easiest of his 17 goals this season, tapping in from a yard after Loach and Cork left a Liam Rosenior cross for each other. Lita's 88th-minute goal completed the rout. \"There were many aspects I was pleased with,\" said Rodgers, who had no triumphant return to the club whose academy he used to direct. \"I'm obviously disapopointed to concede five minutes before half-time because I thought we had played well and dominated possession and in the second half we had a crazy one-minute spell that killed the game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
