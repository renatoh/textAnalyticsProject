In an interview with 3AW on Friday, Turnbull was asked whether he agreed with Stan Grant that we should edit statues, like the Hyde Park statue of James Cook. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cI am an admirer of Stan\u2019s but he is dead wrong here. \u201cTrying to edit our history is wrong. All of those statues, all of those monuments, are part of our history and we should respect them and preserve them \u2013 and by all means, put up other monuments, other statues and signs and sights that explain our history.\u201d The prime minister said efforts to change the date of Australia Day, and to edit statues, was a fringe preoccupation. \u201cI don\u2019t think this has got much momentum, this is very much the Labor, Green, left sort of fringe.\u201d \u201cThe vast majority of Australians are as horrified as you and I are that we would go round rewriting history, editing statues, changing the inscriptions on statues, deleting Australia Day \u2013 I mean what are these people thinking? \u201cThis is the greatest country in the world. We should be so proud of Australia and its history and on Australia Day, we celebrate all of our achievements\u201d. Turnbull said every Australia Day ceremony started with a welcome to country, and an acknowledgement of Indigenous people, and ended \u201cwith a baby in the arms of a migrant mother becoming an Australian citizen\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t rewrite history by editing stuff out.\u201d \u201cIf you want to write a new chapter in our history, if you want to challenge assumptions in the past, by all means do so, but we can\u2019t get into this Stalinist exercise of trying to wipe out or obliterate or blank out parts of our history.\u201d Conservative commentators, such as Alan Jones, have been stoking a culture war backlash against the debate over whether it is appropriate to celebrate Australia Day on 26 January, and the debate over whether statues and inscriptions accurately represent Australia\u2019s history. Earlier in the week, the former prime minister Tony Abbott used a radio interview to declare that if Bill Shorten was elected prime minister, he would tear down statues from the colonial era. Turnbull was also asked on 3AW on Friday about an old story about Abbott missing a vote on Labor\u2019s stimulus package during the global financial crisis because he was intoxicated \u2013 a story which has surfaced again because Abbott confirmed it in an ABC documentary about life inside parliament house. The prime minister was opposition leader when Abbott missed the vote. Turnbull confirmed that the whips had been sent to find Abbott during the vote and \u201ccouldn\u2019t rouse him\u201d. He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Abbott\u2019s behaviour because it had been an important vote. He also suggested Abbott\u2019s behaviour was unusual. \u201cI can\u2019t remember anyone else missing a vote because they were too drunk.\u201d Turnbull was also asked whether he supported banning the burqa in the wake of Pauline Hanson\u2019s stunt in the Senate. The prime minister said he was not a fan of the full face covering, because it was a means of oppressing women, but he said the Commonwealth didn\u2019t have the power to ban the garment. He was also asked about the implications of the current high court action involving the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and other Nationals ministers. Turnbull acknowledged the high court may force the government into a byelection in the seat of New England if Joyce was ruled ineligible, but he played down that likelihood. He also said he was confident the government would run for a full term."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
