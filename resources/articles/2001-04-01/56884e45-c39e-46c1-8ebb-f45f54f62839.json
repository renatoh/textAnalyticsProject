Millwall dealt with theirs in the first half-hour and Steve Claridge dealt with his in the next. After taking a seven-point lead in February, Millwall stumbled through March as though they had shied at promotion. Now they look like the champions elect. \"That was a wonderful performance,\" said the Rotherham manager Ronnie Moore. \"Nobody in this division can touch them.\" Some supporters had questioned Mark McGhee's transfer moves. They wanted a midfield leader to stiffen a young unit that had lost some confidence, or a long-term striking partner for Neil Harris, not ageing stop gaps. But Claridge, 35 tomorrow and short of match fitness, has provided all the confidence, composure, willingness and ability they required. \"He's just lifted the whole place,\" said McGhee. \"There's no doubt he's the reason we've played so well the last two games.\" The last time McGhee signed Claridge on deadline day, for Wolves three years ago, the striker scored no goals in five games and was then packed off to Portsmouth. It looks like working out better this time. Claridge picked up two goals and two man-of-the-match awards on Saturday, and though he has two years left on his contract he has no intention of returning to Portsmouth. \"I love it here,\" he said. \"It's proper. It's proper football. It's my sort of club.\" Rotherham, for some reason, looked as though they would rather be elsewhere. They turned up only 50 minutes before kick-off and then absented themselves whenever a cross came over. \"I wonder if one or two didn't have the bottle for it,\" said Moore. Central defence has been a problem. In the three games since David Artell, a composed, powerful and mobile 20-year-old, was injured, Rotherham have conceded 11 goals. \"We've got five 6ft 2in lads out there,\" Moore pointed out, \"yet they still conceded three goals from set pieces.\" Artell's return on Saturday did not help, but a visit to shot-shy Swansea on Saturday might. This race keeps turning round and there are a few fences left yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
