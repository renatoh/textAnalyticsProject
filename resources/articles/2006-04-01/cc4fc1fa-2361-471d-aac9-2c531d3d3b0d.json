Well, Biarritz became French champions and they are top of the table again this season, but that was not what the scrum-half meant. He was thinking Heineken Cup. In 2004 Biarritz got to the semi-final, only to be beaten by Toulouse. Last year in Paris they met Stade Fran\u00e7ais in what should have been a showpiece of French rugby. The Parc, one of the great atmospheric homes of rugby, was packed on a beautiful spring day. The setting might have been perfect but Stade and Biarritz conspired to produce a stinker. Brian Liebenberg kicked the game to death as a spectacle and Biarritz led going into the last moments, only for Christophe Dominici to squirm over for a try that put the Parisians into the final. Hence that Yachvili sentiment which might well have been echoed in the Munster dressing room on endless European occasions. Munster are the side that have never been beaten at home at Thomond Park, have made two finals, five semi-finals and endless quarter-finals but have never held the cup. In 2000 Northampton pipped them in the final at Twickenham by a point and two years later Leicester won 15-9 in Cardiff. This weekend Biarritz and Munster must think their time has come. Biarritz are at \"home\" in the land of the Basques, if not at their own pretty but too small Parc des Sports Aguil\u00e9ra. The Estadio Anoeta just over the Spanish border in San Sebasti\u00e1n will be heaving with nearly 32,000 spectators, most of them dressed in the red, white and green of the Basque flag. Biarritz have played two Heineken fixtures in this, one of the newest of European rugby venues, and won both. Munster, although \"away\" to Leinster, will be at Lansdowne road, the oldest surviving international rugby stadium, where they beat Perpignan in the quarter-finals and nearly 48,000 are expected at the match. However, while the head says both favourites are right to fancy their chances and the odds are stacked in their favour, the heart pulls another way. First Bath, who flirted with relegation from the Premiership until they beat Bristol last weekend. In four months as head coach Brian Ashton has developed a team for the one-off match. They may have struggled in the league but in the Heineken quarter-final, when they went down to 13 men for the last 10 minutes, they found the resolve to hang on to a slender lead and then, against Bristol, they produced 40 minutes of the most compelling rugby I have seen this season. This week, while Ashton continued to be linked with a return to England, Olly Barkley joined the list recommending him to Twickenham as a coach who could give the backs \"a few fresh ideas\". What Ashton has done in such a short time at Bath is imbue his team with the belief necessary to create the try of the season which was scored by Zak Feaunati after a move that began five yards from the Bath line. The key was keeping the ball alive whenever possible, off-loading either before or in the tackle and constantly switching the point of attack. Eighty minutes of that might be too much to ask but Biarritz, the most Anglo-Saxon of the big clubs in France, will have seen the video and must be wondering whether their third semi-final will be as unlucky as the first two. Munster will also have watched a couple of video nasties: Leinster's final pool game, against Bath, and their quarter-final in Toulouse. Biarritz beat Toulouse a couple of weeks ago but that was nothing compared with the drubbing Leinster gave them. In both the Bath and Toulouse matches Felipe Contepomi ran riot. Leinster's coach Michael Cheika, who is also new to his job, has clearly decided the Argentinian trainee surgeon must have carte blanche. If he operates half as well on Sunday - and Munster do not use their undoubted forward power - I think my heart is in safe hands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
