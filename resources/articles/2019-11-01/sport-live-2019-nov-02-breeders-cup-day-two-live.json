Mongolian Groom has been put down as his injuries meant that he could not be saved. After what had been to that point an excellent and injury-free two days of racing, it is a truly miserable way to end the meeting and one that is likely to reverberate for days, weeks and potentially months to come. The only name that is likely to be widely remembered from this Breeders\u2019 Cup is that of the horse that did not cross the line. Grim news. This is Greg Wood at Santa Anita, signing off. No further news on Mongolian Groom for almost an hour now. He remains under observation at Santa Anita\u2019s equine hospital and it could be some time before there is anything more to report. The Paulick Report website reports that X-rays show Mongolian Groom has fractures in the lower part of his cannon-bone and the upper part of his pastern, and quotes veterinary surgeon Dr Al Ruggles. In the interview room, one of the owners of Vino Rosso is pointing out that the horse spent the first couple of years of his life alongside Justify, last year\u2019s Triple Crown winner, at the farm of breeder John Gunther. Some crop, that. Latest news on Mongolian Groom from a Santa Anita spokesperson: Mongolian Groom was pulled up at the top of the stretch ... with a serious injury to his left hind ankle. The injury is serious and at this point they [veterinary staff] are trying to work with connections on what treatment options they would like to pursue. Fearing the worst for Mongolian Groom. It had been an injury-free meeting until the final furlong of the final race, what a desperate way to conclude if the news is as bad as it seems. There are chants of \u201cVi-no, Vi-no\u201d in the winner\u2019s enclosure as Todd Pletcher\u2019s 13th runner in the Classic proves to be the one that gives him a first success. Mongolian Groom appeared to suffer a leg injury and has been taken straight to the track\u2019s hospital for assessment. McKinzie was sat in ideal position turning in but Vino Rosso came up with an irresistible charge down the stretch to put the race to bed half a furlong from the line. Higher Power, Elate and Math Wizard filled the next three places. A hugely exciting race but there is, possibly, the post-script no-one wanted. Mongolian Groom appeared to break down in the stretch and was taken away in the ambulance. More news as it arrives. 1 VINO ROSSO, 2 McKinzie, 3 Higher Power A stretch duel and then it goes the way of Vino Rosso! McKinzie second, Higher Power third. McKinzie in front but here comes Vino Rosso Three are clear at the moment, McKinzie included Favourite going ominously well McKinzie running free, half-checked by the leader but sits second War Of Will leads early McKinzie broke well, Code Of Honor held up Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic! The runners are going behind. A big cheer as the track announcer says that it\u2019s post time for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic! I\u2019d take a picture to show you how beautiful the San Gabriel mountains look in the sunset, but no photo could do them justice. Three minutes to the off in the Classic. Almost $4m in the win pool, and more than $1m for the place. McKinzie is showing at 5-2 on the tote, with Code Of Honor 7-2. Vino Rosso is 9-2, Yoshida is 5-1, Elate and Higher Power are both 9-1. Six of the 11, in other words, at shorter than 10-1. So, as the sun sinks lower in the Californian sky and the runners start to come out onto the track, it\u2019s time to make your pick in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic. My 1-2-3: Code Of Honor, Elate, McKinzie. And don\u2019t forget Higher Power in a remarkably open Classic. He was below his best last time out but would have every chance on his win in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar. The mare Elate is another live runner. She has finished close behind Blue Prize and Midnight Bisou, the 1-2 in teh Distaff, on her last two starts and also won the Delaware Handicap at Del Mar earlier this year. Spurned by Baffert, Mike Smith is now on Yoshida, a regular in the big Grade 1 events and fourth at Churchill 12 months ago. He was within two lengths of McKinzie at Saratoga but is without a top-flight win since last year\u2019s Woodward. Vino Rosso was first past the post in the Jockey Club Gold Cup but (rightly, I think) lost the race to Code Of Honor in the stewards\u2019 room. But he\u2019s a big runner too, and has Grade 1 winning form over track and trip earlier this year. I reckon Code Of Honor will give McKinzie plenty to think about. The runner-up in the Kentucky Derby has won three times since, including the Travers at Saratoga and the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont. Post time for the Classic is in 36 minutes so that\u2019s plenty of time for some video form ahead of the biggest race of the day. McKinzie is the favourite, and was due to be ridden by Big Money Mike Smith until Bob Baffert jocked him off in favour of Joel Rosario a month ago. He has done most of his racing at shorter trips than today\u2019s 10 furlongs, and was only 12th of 14 when fancied for the Classic 12 months ago. His form has been a bit in and out this year too, but at his best - in the Whitney at Saratoga, for instance - he definitely looks like the one to beat. They have just shown Zenyatta\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic in 2009 on the big screen. In a game of Desert Island Races, it\u2019s the one I\u2019d hold onto if the other seven were swept away. The moment when she loomed up in the straight after looking a lost cause going past the Clubhouse first time was astonishing, thrilling and magical all at once. Just one race to go now at Breeders\u2019 Cup 2019 and while the Europeans will be returning home with just the one winner, it\u2019s been everything that the organisers could have hoped for so far in terms of the safety and welfare of the participants. There\u2019s a fair old gap until the big race - it\u2019s scheduled for 64 minutes after the turf to give NBC a good, long run at it. Old Persian was a big disappointment, he took a strong hold early on and was one of the first horses beaten. That was a performance worthy of a Horse Of The Year award from Bricks And Mortar, not least after the series of reverses for favourites at the meeting so far. Ryan Moore had to check at a vital stage in the stretch but it\u2019s very hard to argue that he might have beaten the favourite. 1 BRICKS AND MORTAR, 2 United, 3 Anthony Van Dyck Ryan Moore niggling on the Derby winner, then he\u2019s blocked in his run as Bricks and Mortar charges, and he\u2019s got there, Bricks And Mortar gets up to win! The big three are all well positioned to challenge Outsider Acclimate leads them out down the back, Bricks and Mortar fourth, Old Persian is seventh coming down the straight for the first time, Anthony Van Dyck settled against the rail in fifth Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf! Arklow getting worked up in the stalls Irad Ortiz and Bricks And Mortar will be coming out of stall nine, alongside Old Persian and William Buick in 10. Anthony Van Dyck and Ryan More are in five, and they\u2019re going in. This is what the Europeans have to contend with: Bricks And Mortar taking the Manhattan at Belmont Park in New York. Anthony Van Dyck, Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s last chance of a winner to match Joseph\u2019s, is a 6-1 chance. Old Persian is 7-2 to extend Charlie Appleby\u2019s remarkable record at the Breeders\u2019 Cup. The runners are out on the track for the Turf. Bricks And Mortar, on a six-race winning streak to here, is the hot favourite. Midnight Bisou was on a six-race winning streak. So was Sistercharlie. Some punters are starting to sense a pattern here ... We\u2019re now heading towards the climax of the meeting: the Turf in 10 minutes\u2019 time and then the Classic. Here\u2019s the replay of the Distaff: As expected, Smith is taking plenty of flak on social media. In his defence, Midnight Bisou did not break all that well and had to face plenty of kickback against the rail. But even so, it did not look good. Blue Prize has run her last race and now retires to the paddocks. Midnight Bisou, however, will be kept in training at five, presumably with the Distaff at Keeneland next year as the long-term target. For the second time today, Big Money Mike Smith has become Lose Money Mike Smith for the backers, again finishing fast but too late on one of the shortest-priced favourites at the meeting. Midnight Bisou had three lengths to make up just to reach the fourth-placed horse turning for home. She did her best, but faced an impossible task to run down the winner. Smith is the winning-most jockey in Breeders\u2019 Cup history, but that will not count for much with favourite-backers right now. 1 BLUE PRIZE, 2 Midnight Bisou, 3 Serengeti Empress Chasing but not catching, Blue Prize wins with Midnight Bisou only second. Another big favourite beaten. Blue Prize in front, Midnight Bisou chasing Here she comes but too late? Midnight Bisou has work to do Paradise Woods also close up Midnight Bisou against the rail in seventh, Serengeti Empress still leads, halfway down the back Serengeti Empress quickly away, Mo See Cal chasing, Midnight BIsou mid division Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Distaff! Midnight Bisou was third behind Monomoy Girl in last year\u2019s Distaff but she has taken her form to a new level at four. Dunbar Road, a Grade 1 winner at Saratoga in the summer, and Blue Prize, who beat her in the Spinster last time, are the only other horses at single figure odds. This is all about Midnight Bisou, who will be a huge contender for Horse Of The Year if she can get the win here. It has been a tricky meeting for the punters overall but Mitole was a popular winner of the Sprint earlier, for this backer in particular. Here\u2019s Uni\u2019s win in the Mile via Twitter: Two heavy favourites have been beaten already today in Sistercharlie and Omaha Beach. Now here comes another: Midnight Bisou, market leader for the Distaff. She\u2019s showing at 4-5 to complete an unbeaten eight-race season having started her campaign on 27 January at Sam Houston Park. This is her most recent win, in the Beldame Stakes at Belmont Park. Rosario lost a lot of ground making his challenge as he did, but there was never going to be anything getting in his way in the stretch. He was tracking Circus Maximus until the turn out of the back but left him standing on his charge for glory. Circus Maximus was only a nose behind Without Parole in fourth but that\u2019s another sweep of the places for the Americans. Uni made a huge move around the outside on the turn for home and ended up five wide entering the the stretch as a result, but it turned out to be a winning decision by Joel Rosario. He was in front with about half a furlong to run and was going away again at the line. 1 UNI, 2 Got Stormy, 3 Without Parole Big outside move by Uni, Frankie getting swamped, Uni goes on to win, with Got Stormy next Circus Maximus about sixth on theoutside El Tormenta next, Frankie setting a good clip Frankie gets across to lead from 13 on Hey Gaman Approaching the stalls ... starting to load ... Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Mile! If one of the other runners here sound familiar, by the way, it should. Without Parole won last year\u2019s St James\u2019s Palace Stakes for John Gosden and started the season in Newmarket before a switch to Chad Brown\u2019s US stable. Four minutes to post in the Mile. Joseph O\u2019Brien has a slice of history already, now his dad Aidan will try to add another. I\u2019ve not had time to check, but I think the chances of there having been a father and son saddling winners on the same day at the Breeders\u2019 Cup before are somewhat remote. They are in the paddock for the Mile. In the meantime, here\u2019s Joseph O\u2019Brien winning the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf on St Nicholas Abbey as an 18-year-old. What\u2019s really scary is that he\u2019s only 26 now. Yesterday was tough for the Europeans but Iridessa\u2019s has instilled a bit more confidence and there are several runners with a chance in the Mile, up next in 20 minutes. Circus Maximus, a Royal Ascot winner, is the obvious team leader but Space Traveller and Danny Tudhope are worth a second look - I tipped them, as it happens - while the popular grey Lord Glitters and James\u2019s Tate\u2019s Hey Gaman, with Frankie aboard, are not just here to make up the numbers. Leading the home side is Get Stormy from the Mark Casse stable. He\u2019s the narrow 5-2 favourite on the tote at the moment with Circus Maximus next at 7-2. Space Traveller is currently 25-1 by the way if you have access to the US pools. Just as he did in the Amsterdam, Shancelot absolutely blitzed through the opening quarter and he still looked good for the win turning in. But Ricardo Santana had got it just right on Mitole and as the leader started to tire, he ran him down to win with something to spare. He just couldn\u2019t dominate the whole of a Grade 1 field as he did at Grade 2 level. 1 MITOLE, 2 Shancelot, 3 Whitmore Can he keep it up? they\u2019re turning in, Shancelot still here comes Mitole, getting to him a sub 22 second quarter Shancelot is burning along Catalina Cruiser slowly away, Shancelot quickly in front Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Sprint! Joseph O\u2019Brien is presumably heading straight on to Melbourne tonight, but you wouldn\u2019t put it past him to call in at Cork on the way ... Impressive stuff, but then you see Shancelot\u2019s win in the Grade Two Amsterdam Stakes and all you can say is wow. They were strung out like washing after two furlongs as Shancelot set outstanding fractions, but at no stage did he ever look like stopping in front. He\u2019s not backed it up since but has been beaten only narrowly, including by Omaha Beach here at Santa Anita. A return to that form would make him very hard to beat and he\u2019s favourite at 9-5. Give the Amsterdam a watch: The runners for the Sprint have come into the paddock amid all the excitement. It\u2019s a shame that Imperial Hint is out but this is still a really interesting renewal of this race, with three big contenders in Catalina Cruiser, Shancelot and Mitole. Mitole has been beaten only once in nine starts, when second to Imperial Hint in a race at Saratoga that was run in record time. This is his excellent win in the Forego Stakes: Joseph O\u2019Brien is in the interview room, talking about Iridessa: We thought she was a legitimate contender. We had a good draw and Wayne gave her a fantastic ride, it\u2019s a special day And here, while I\u2019ve got a moment, is the vid of Spun To Run\u2019s defeat of Omaha Beach earlier on. O\u2019Brien and Lordan will be in the interview room soon. In the meantime, here\u2019s the replay of her victory via the Breeders\u2019 Cup Twitter feed: Some day for Joseph O\u2019Brien, who has now had winners at Flemington in Australia, Down Royal in Ireland and Santa Anita in California. That was a fantastic ride by Wayne Lordan. He knew, of course, that Mirth would come back to the field but he would not have been human if a few doubts hadn\u2019t started to creep in as they left the back stretch. He then timed his run to perfection in the stretch, having made sure he was right on Vasilika\u2019s tail turning in. He then had just enough left to edge past Flavien Prat for the win at 13-1. 1 IRIDESSA 2 Vasilika 3 Sistercharlie Iridess wins for Joseph O\u2019Brien and Wayne Lordan, O\u2019Brien is the second person - after Freddy Head - to both ride and train a Breeders\u2019 Cup winner. Iridessa is in front, closing stages ... she goes past locked with Vasilika Castle Lady goes after her, the lead is shrinking Mirth eight lengths clear going down the back, Vasilika still in pursuit Mirth is a clear leader from Vasilika Iridessa third going past the stands, Sistercharlie fifth Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf! Sistercharlie is even money. Vasillika is second choice at 5-1, Billesdon Brook - a 1,000 Guineas winner, no less - is 18-1 and Iridessa is 14-1. Frankie has got some backers though, despite a wide draw, and Fanny Logan is showing at around 7-1. Two minutes to post time! Another interesting runner, meanwhile, is Dan Ward\u2019s Vasilika, in more ways than one. Until recently, she was trained by Hall of Famer Jerry Hollendorfer, who was banned from Santa Anita in June after a fourth horse in his care suffered a fatal injury while racing since the start of the year. Janet Hollendorfer, his wife, is one of Vasilika\u2019s co-owners and there could be some fireworks in the interview room if she prevails. Iridessa\u2019s Group One wins include the Matron Stakes: Sistercharlie is showing at 4-5 on the tote and she will be a very tough nut to crack. Here she is winning the Beverly D Stakes earlier this year: Frankie Dettori has been discussing his ride on Fanny Logan with Nick Luck, 25 years after his first Breeders\u2019 Cup win in the same colours on Barathea. That really wasn\u2019t Mike Smith\u2019s finest hour, though praise is also due to Irad Ortiz jnr who rode a perfect race from the front, taking charge from an early stage and getting his opponents to dance to his tune. Another hot favourite goes down, and another coming up. Sistercharlie defends her crown in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf in 17 minutes\u2019 time, vs European challengers Iridessa, Billesdon Brook, Just Wonderful and Fanny Logan. As expected, Mike Smith\u2019s effort there did not find favour with many of Omaha Beach\u2019s punters. Most tweets are unsuitable for a family audience, this is one of the few without at least half a dozen very rude words. Talking of Twitter, here\u2019s a take on Covfefe\u2019s win earlier: Twitter, I sense, is not going to be kind to \u201cBig Money\u201d Mike Smith after that ride on Omaha Beach. The pace is holding up very well at Santa Anita this afternoon. Spun To Run is another all-the-way winner, sent straight into a lead he never looked likely to surrender by Irad Ortiz jnr. It was soft lead too - they covered the half-mile in 46.51sec - and Mike Smith gave him too much rope on Omaha Beach. He closed from the home turn but he was always going to run out of track. 1 SPUN TO RUN, 2 Omaha Beach, 3 Blue Chipper He\u2019s going to come up short, Spun To Run hangs on, Omaha Beach second Spun To Run still in front, here comes the favourite Omaha Beach still plenty to do but starting to make progress Blue Chipper is second Omaha Beach mid division, five lengths off the lead Spun To Run leads into the first turn Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Dirt Mile! This race starts right in front of the stand, can\u2019t beat the sound of the gates crashing open. One minute to post time. The punters are not convinced by that form, however, and are very much siding with Omaha Beach. He could well be the first, perhaps only, odds-on shot on the card and is currently showing at 4-5. The main challengers to Omaha Beach are expected to be Improbable and Mr Money, who both ran in the Pennsylvania Derby earlier in the year, finishing fourth and second respectively. Omaha Beach had been off the track for six months, however, when he returned to action with a victory in the Santa Anita Sprint Championship. That gives him the unusual record coming into today\u2019s race of having won his last two starts, both Grade 1 events, at nine furlongs and then six furlongs. There is a British-trained runner in the race in Jane Chapple-Hyam\u2019s Ambassadorial with Jamie Spencer in the plate. He\u2019s the only European runner on the dirt at the meeting, and a big outsider at 60-1. The favourite is Omaha Beach, who was also favourite for the Kentucky Derby earlier in the year until he was scratched three days before the race due to a breathing problem. He was the favourite for the Derby after winning the Arkansas Derby: More on the Turf Sprint as it arrives, but now it\u2019s getting towards time for what is without doubt the most entertaining/intriguing/bizarre* name for a race on the card all night: the Big Ass Fans Dirt Mile. (*delete according to taste). The new sponsors of the Dirt Mile make fans. Very big fans, in fact. And their logo is an Ass. Hence, Big Ass Fans. Another winner on the tight turf track here that made most or all of the running. Belvoir Bay was a 15-1 shot but never seemed likely to be reeled in after somehow managing to get to the lead from his wide draw in stall 12. Eddie Haskell beat only one home, Totally Boss was away well enough from his inside draw but last and beaten with two furlongs to run. Stormy Liberal was in fourth turning in but soon faded. 1 BELVOIR BAY, 2 Om, 3 Shekky Shebaz But they\u2019re not going to get there, Belvoir Bay makes all Belvoir Bay leads at the turn, here comes Shekky Shebaz and Om Totally Boss is last Belvoir Bay prominent, Shekky Shebaz close up Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Sprint! They are out on the track for the Turf Sprint, six minutes to post time. Shekky Shebaz is popular with the local players, he was 12-1 on the morning line but is currently 5-1 here. He took the Lucky Coin Stakes at Saratoga. Totally Boss is also fancied, along with Imprimis, the first of Frankie Dettori\u2019s rides today. Here\u2019s Totally Boss winning at Kentucky Downs, in a race that also includes the super-busy Stormy Liberal and Imprimis, who can be seen getting little luck in running on the way to finishing fourth. Next up here is the Turf Sprint, in which the admirably durable Stormy Liberal will attempt to complete a hat-trick of wins having taken the same event at both Del Mar and Churchill Downs over the last two years. He\u2019s not the favourite, though (current 13-1, in fact). Eddie Haskell was the morning-line favourite at 9-2 and can be seen here finishing second in the Eddie D Stakes, with Stormy Liberal in third. Covfefe was sent off at 3-2 and won by three-quarters of a length. Spiced Perfection was fourth, and Come Dancing was sixth. A very smooth success for Joel Rosario on Brad Cox\u2019s three-year-old, pretty much Plan A all the way. He was settled in third down the back, took over on the home turn and stayed on well as only Bellafina of the market leaders managed to raise a challenge. 1 COVFEFE, 2 Bellafina, 3 Dawn The Destroyer Covfefe leads, Bellafina chasing in the stretch Covfefe best placed of the market leaders turning in Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Sprint! Covfefe was the favourite on the morning line but it looks like Come Dancing will go off as favourite, though only narrowly. One minute to post time for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Sprint. It would be stretching things to say that my tips for yesterday\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup races covered themselves in glory. Unabashed, however, I present my picks for today\u2019s nine races, which will no doubt include one or more reasons for deep embarrassment in six hours\u2019 time. 18.55 Covfefe 19.33 Totally Boss 20.10 Omaha Beach 20.54 Iridessa (nb) 21.36 Shancelot 22.20 Space Traveller 23.00 Midnight Bisou 23.40 Old Persian (nap) 0.44 Code Of Honour Come Dancing is the early favourite for the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint (this isn\u2019t really Donald Trump territory, after all). She\u2019s 7-5 on the tote, with Covfefe on 5-2 and Spiced Perfection on 7-1. Bellafina, trained by British-born Simon Callaghan, also finding backers. She\u2019s 5-1, and can be seen here winning the Santa Anita Oaks. A truly immense American flag is currently being carried out onto the track, ready for the rendition of the Star Spangled Banner without which no sporting occasion here is complete. And finally, Spiced Perfection landing the Thoroughbred Club of America Stakes, a Grade 2. And here\u2019s Come Dancing, winning - somewhat appropriately - the Grade 1 Ballerina Stakes. The final race before the Breeders\u2019 Cup events is due off in 10 minutes. It\u2019s the Twilight Derby, which I\u2019m fairly certain used to be at the end of the card as the name suggests, but now it\u2019s run at 11am local time. Go figure, as they say. After that, it\u2019s on to the nine Breeders\u2019 Cup races, kicking off with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint. The races will come up thick and fast once we get going, so here\u2019s some video form to peruse as the minutes count down to post time. The market leaders for this race - which, somewhat confusingly for Europeans, is run over seven furlongs - are Covfefe - named after one of Donald Trump\u2019s bizarre Twitter bloopers - Come Dancing and Spiced Perfection. First up, Covfefe, getting the better of a fantastic stretch duel with Serengeti Empress at Saratoga. Hello and welcome to Santa Anita in Arcadia, Los Angeles, for day two of the 2019 Breeders\u2019 Cup (or welcome back, if you were here on Friday as Europe\u2019s challenge for the juvenile events was comprehensively dismissed by the American-trained two-year-olds). That was a disappointing way for the travelling contingent to start the weekend, but Saturday\u2019s card is where the real riches and glory lie and there are European runners with big chances in three of the four turf events. Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner, attempts to win his first race since in the Turf where Old Persian is also strongly fancied, and Circus Maximus, the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes winner, is the probable favourite for the Mile. And there are also five ultra-competitive races on the main track which will have fans of dirt racing queuing up at the betting windows in the hope of retrieving just a little of what they left behind on Friday. There were some unexpected results here yesterday to say the least, above all in the feature event, the Juvenile, where all three of the eight horses that were showing at single-figure odds at the off finished out of the frame. The \u201call-sources handle\u201d for yesterday\u2019s 10-race card, including five Breeders\u2019 Cup events, was a new record for the first day of the meeting at $56.5m [\u00a346m], so somebody definitely went home happy. Form-followers, though, will hope that the racing redistributes wealth a little more even-handedly this afternoon. The first three Breeders\u2019 Cup races are all-American affairs after Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s two entries in the Turf Sprint (19.33) failed to make it onto the plane. The action starts at 18.55GMT with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint - and rolls all the way to one of the most open renewals of the Classic that I can remember at 00.44GMT. McKinzie, Vino Rosso, Code Of Honor, Yoshida and Elate are all priced up at between 4-1 and 7-1 by Britain\u2019s bookmakers and the fans here at Santa Anita may face an equally tricky task in separating them when the time comes around seven hours from now. The best news after yesterday\u2019s opening card was that all the runners returned safe and well after their races. This Breeders\u2019 Cup is being staged under unprecedented scrutiny after the much-publicised deaths of 36 horses at this track while either racing or training since the start of the year. The track has initiated a number of reforms in an attempt to address the issue and, so far, the rate of fatal injuries has dropped sharply since racing resumed here after the summer break at the end of September. Management and fans will still approach today\u2019s action with some apprehension, however, as there is a low level of inherent risk in horse racing and no amount of effort will ever get the injury rate down to zero. Around 997 of every 1,000 starters here do not suffer a fatal injury, but an incident-free Breeders\u2019 Cup would certainly help to underline the point. And even then, there are still deep structural issues in American racing which need to be addressed, as this excellent analysis by Mark Irby of Animal Wellness Action points out. Santa Anita\u2019s new regime on veterinary inspections of all runners has had a significant impact on the European challenge today, as both Fleeting (Filly &amp; Mare Turf) and Suedois (Mile) have been ruled out after being found to be slightly lame when inspected this morning. Other non-runners from the original declarations are Thais, the probable pace-maker in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, who was ruled out by vets a couple of days ago, and Imperial Hint, who was scratched from the Sprint after his morning inspection. The main card at the Breeders\u2019 Cup is one of the best racing days of the year, the action gets underway in just over an hour and there will be video form and more for all the races in this space as the day goes on.
