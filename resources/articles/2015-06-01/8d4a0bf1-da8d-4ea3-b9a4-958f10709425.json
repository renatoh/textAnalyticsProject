The Rev Melvin Tinker, vicar of St John in Newland in Hull, said he was outraged to hear that Canon Michael Smith of York Minster would be giving a blessing to York Pride on Saturday. Speaking on Minster FM, he said: \u201cWould he say serial adulterers should be welcome in the church? Should he say that people who are engaged in paedophilia should be involved in the church?\u201d Tinker was repeatedly asked by an interviewer if he was likening homosexuality to paedophilia. He responded: \u201cWe are talking about moral categories here, and if homosexual sex falls into the immoral category, then it is in the same category as any other immoral action.\u201d When reminded that homosexuality is legal, he said: \u201cAt one time of course homosexual genital activity was illegal.\u201d Tinker accused Smith of \u201cflaunting the scriptures under the banner of equality\u201d. He said: \u201cWhat we are talking about is whether certain actions are right or wrong in God\u2019s eyes, as he has revealed it in scripture, and also according to natural law as well.\u201d Greg Stephenson, chair of York Pride, said it was disappointing that such comments are being made in 2015, adding. \u201cIt just reinforces why Pride events are so important. There\u2019s more to them than just a big party. It\u2019s to highlight that these kind of comments and views are still out there and that they need changing.\u201d About 400 rainbow flags will go up across York as part of Saturday\u2019s march, which organisers hope will attract as many as 5,000 people. York Minster, which will drape a 15-metre rainbow flag across its steps, has issued a statement saying that it plans to show its support for the LGBT community. \u201cAs in previous years, York Pride will begin its parade from outside the west end of York Minster, and for the second year running we are joining other groups in the city of York in showing our support for a section of the community that frequently experiences discrimination and hostility,\u201d it read. \u201cYork Minster\u2019s invitation to everyone to discover God\u2019s love through our welcome, worship, learning and work is extended to the entire community \u2013 both inside and outside of the minster. The Church of England is actively encouraging conversations around human sexuality and it is better to have those conversations with friends.\u201d A local group, LGBT Christian Fellowship for Hull and East Riding, issued a statement saying that Tinker did not represent all Christians. It said: \u201cAlthough we have a long way to go, that\u2019s not actually the view of people in the pews.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
