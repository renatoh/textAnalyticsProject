Trabzonspor were 4-0 down at home when the incident took place and their fans had been throwing projectiles on to the field. Then one fan jumped on to the pitch and pushed the official, Volkan Bayarslan, to the ground. He then punched Bayarslan while he was on the ground. The game was immediately called off with both sets of players and officials running off the field. Fenerbahce are likely to be awarded a win for the game meaning the points difference between themselves and Besiktas, the Super Lig leaders, will be reduced to three with four weeks to go. This article was amended on 25 April 2015. The points difference between Fenerbahce and Besiktas will be reduced to three, not one, as originally stated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
