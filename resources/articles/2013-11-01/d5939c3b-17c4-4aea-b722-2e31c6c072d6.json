Just hours after the Co-operative Bank admitted it was losing current accounts because of concerns over its future as an ethical institution amid the intervention of hedge funds and the scandal over former chairman Paul Flowers, it emerged that the US hedge fund Aurelius had sold its position in the bank's bonds. Aurelius \u2013 best known for forcing Argentina to pay out on its debts \u2013 had bought up Co-op bonds as they collapsed in value following the downgrade of the bank to junk status in May. Since then the bonds have risen in value and have now been sold on to another hedge fund, London-based Perry Capital. Perry pledged to continue backing the crucial restructuring of the bank just hours before Friday's deadline to vote on the deal. The so-called LT2 group of hedge funds, which included Aurelius and has forced the changes on the Co-op Group, made no reference to the crucial change in its membership when it reiterated its support for the restructuring on Thursday morning. If bondholders vote to back the restructuring of the bank, the wider Co-op Group, which includes supermarkets and funeral homes, will end up with just a 30% stake in the bank that bears its name. The deadline for votes is 4.30pm on Friday. The Co-op, in an unscheduled announcement outlining technical changes to the terms offered to LT2, insisted that its savers \u2013 whom it relies on to finance its business \u2013 were not moving their cash out of the bank and its deposit base remained stable. Flowers is on bail until January after being arrested following a Mail on Sunday report that showed a video of the 63-year-old Methodist minister handing over cash to apparently buy drugs. Even before Flowers' arrest there was concern that the intervention of hedge funds in the Co-op fundraising could make it difficult for the bank to maintain its ethical stance. \"These recent events, together with the competitive landscape in which the bank operates, the introduction of seven-day account switching and the associated increased competitor marketing activity at a time when the bank has been constrained in its ability to undertake its own marketing activity, may be a contributing factor to an increase the bank has seen in the switching out of current accounts,\" Co-op said. The wording is tougher than that in the prospectus sent to bondholders on 4 November to back the restructuring when it referred to a \"material reduction\" in the number of people moving their accounts to the bank since the seven-day switching service was introduced in September. At that time it said corporate customers had taken away \u00a31.4bn worth of deposits since the ratings downgrade in May. The admission by the Co-op bank came as its regulator, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, said the regulatory approval granted to enable Flowers to become chairman in 2010 was \"before his time\". Bailey, who took over the top regulation job in the summer of 2011, said he had required the Co-op bank board to be strengthened and had set out hurdles for the bank to meet if it was to be granted approval for the takeover of 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. That deal, called Verde, collapsed this year. Bailey insisted he did not \"know the whole story\" about what had happened or about any potential intervention from politicians keen to see the Co-op take over the Lloyds' branches. He added: \"The real important thing today is not to deal with Reverend Flowers's antics but to deal with stabilisation and restructuring of the bank.\" Lord Myners, City minister during the 2008 banking crisis, called for institutional investors to be represented when bank directors are appointed. \"We need a fundamental change in accountability and alignment within the board room. Shareholders had got off scot-free when it came to culpability for bank failures and the cost to the economy,\" Myners said. Lloyds looks to lord The Conservative peer Lord Blackwell is the leading candidate to become the next chairman of the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group. The former head of Sir John Major's policy unit, and a serial non-executive director, already has a seat on the bank's board and chairs its insurance arm Scottish Widows. He previously sat on the board of Standard Life and retailers Dixons and was once a partner at the management consultants McKinsey. The bank, whose chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, received a \u00a32.3m bonus last week because of the rally in its shares, has been seeking a successor to Sir Win Bischoff who wants to retire at next year's annual meeting. The government began to sell its stake in Lloyds in September and now owns a 32% shareholding, which is expected to fall further before the general election through a sell-off to retail investors. Lloyds would not comment on its next chairman on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
