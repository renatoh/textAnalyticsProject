A shadow cabinet meeting last week, billed as key in deciding Labour\u2019s position, failed to reach an agreement after Corbyn said he wanted to consult unions and others further before making a decision, going against the view of several shadow ministers. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he was among those who wanted a more openly pro-referendum and pro-remain approach. \u201cI\u2019ve said publicly I would vote remain, I\u2019d campaign for remain. Jeremy then said we need to consult our executive committee members,\u201d McDonnell said. Before the shadow cabinet meeting, McDonnell said, he thought \u201cwe were going to move further\u201d. He continued: \u201cThe unions asked for a bit more time \u2013 fair enough, I don\u2019t mind that. The type of leader that Jeremy is is a consensus-builder, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to do: bring people together, have those consultations, those discussions, and bring people together.\u201d Asked whether he had privately described Labour\u2019s Brexit policy as a \u201cslow-motion car crash\u201d, McDonnell declined to comment, but also did not reject the idea that this was his view. He said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been trying to say is we need to move now, and Jeremy said a month ago, we\u2019re going to put this issue back to the people \u2013 I fully agree.\u201d Some Labour sources have said the delays were in part prompted by pressure from McCluskey\u2019s union, Unite, and people in Corbyn\u2019s office such as his chief of staff, Karie Murphy, a close friend of McCluskey. But speaking later on Sunday to BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, McCluskey argued that there was no need to rush, and that Corbyn would not be pushed into a decision even if shadow ministers wanted the party to seek a second referendum, in which it would back remain. \u201cThat\u2019s perfectly legitimate for them to express that view,\u201d McCluskey said. \u201cWhat Jeremy Corbyn is doing \u2013 and that\u2019s why Jeremy Corbyn is such a strong leader \u2013 he\u2019s not being bulled into any position by anybody.\u201d McCluskey said that while he vehemently opposed a no-deal Brexit, he believed the most nationally unifying policy could be for Labour to win a general election and negotiate an economically robust form of Brexit. He criticised what he said was unnecessary pressure to make a decision: \u201cThere seems to be a panic to rush in order to establish a different position from one the Labour party has had for a couple of years now, which is respecting the result of the 2016 referendum and trying to negotiate a deal which would unite the nation. \u201cUnfortunately we have had a prime minister who has made huge mistakes and a government which has been incapable of delivering Brexit. And we have had a well-funded remain lobby that has turned the nation into a toxic situation.\u201d He said: \u201cThe reality is there is no panic to do anything. We\u2019ve got a policy conference coming up in less than 12 weeks. Let Jeremy Corbyn consult. \u201cMy message to Labour MPs and to our Labour members is: Jeremy\u2019s done OK so far, so let\u2019s trust him to consult and see what emerges.\u201d Elsewhere in his Sky interview, McDonnell, who was wearing a badge with the logo of the green direct action protest group Extinction Rebellion, defended Labour\u2019s plan to consider delisting from the stock exchange companies who cause excess environmental damage. Extinction Rebellion had \u201cput climate change at the top of our agenda, so it\u2019s the priority for the next Labour government, basically\u201d, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to ensure that there\u2019s proper regulation of activity. We\u2019ve got to have a just transition from a fossil fuel economy to a net zero economy as soon as we can,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cBut also, if there are companies that aren\u2019t fulfilling their environmental responsibilities, undermining everything that we do, putting our planet at risk, there has to be some sanctions as well, and that\u2019s regulation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
