I saw poverty first hand, I saw people living in slums. Postwar Britain in the 60s was pretty grim. That shapes you.\" As a result, Gerada adds, \"I've grown up with a sense of social conscience and a sense that if one really, really works hard, you can change people's lives. Clearly that sounds patronising, but you can.\" Colleagues say she calls herself a socialist doctor. She says: \"I would describe myself as someone who was brought up in a socialist environment with the belief that if you work hard enough you can reap the reward personally \u2013 I earn a good living \u2013 but at the same time you cannot walk past people who have nothing.\" She has a particular interest in reducing the stark health inequalities that blight British society, and which studies show are no less narrow now than at the time of the great depression. The Hurley Group of GP practices across London, with which she is a partner, specialises in providing high-quality healthcare to poor, urban populations and hard-to-reach groups, including the homeless, drug users and migrants. But, she adds: \"I'm not an evangelical; I'm not a missionary. But I wouldn't be a GP if I had views that were any different.\" Gerada's new role as the leader of Britain's 40,000 family doctors means she is now a key member of the medical establishment. Feisty, articulate and committed to what she sees as the NHS's core principles, she has more influence than power, but will quickly become well known through regular media appearances. However, the 51-year-old London GP's new-found prominence is unlikely to suit Andrew Lansley, the health secretary. Where the doctor she is replacing, Professor Steve Field, was enthusiastic about the government's controversial NHS reforms, she is passionately critical. Unease about the potential impact of the shake-up is growing among doctors, and Gerada's views may mean that she becomes a sort of unofficial leader of the opposition to it. When Lansley unveiled his NHS reform white paper in July most health organisations gave it a cautious welcome, with opposition at the time only coming from predictable quarters such as the health unions Unite and Unison. Some NHS stakeholders did not publicly air concerns for fear of getting onto the wrong side of Lansley so early on in his stint at the Department of Health, while others needed time to think through the implications of such a radical and wide-ranging document \u2013 what Gerada calls \"a revolution\". But five months on there is, broadly speaking, a consensus among key medical organisations such as the British Medical Association (BMA), the King's Fund thinktank and the NHS Confederation that while they back Lansley's plan to put GPs in England in charge of the \u00a380bn a year job of commissioning their patients' healthcare, he is going too far, too fast. They say he should pause, listen to his critics and try less earth-shattering changes than foisting on the NHS in England what some say is the biggest shake-up in its 62-year history. She congratulates Lansley for his \"bravery\" in handing doctors control of commissioning, adding: \"I have no doubt in my mind that GPs will rise to the challenge. \"If you asked GPs to run a fish-farm they would run it well,\" she says. \"But I'm concerned about the pace of change in the white paper and the fact that we're changing everything \u2013 dismantling primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs), and putting GPs in charge of \u00a380bn worth of resources, and moving public health over to local authorities \u2013 all at the same time, and all at a time of deficit.\" She is also worried about the NHS having to spend what the British Medical Journal estimated to be \u00a32bn to \u00a33bn in transition costs changing over to a new system of local consortia of GPs by 2013, and about even some GPs being taken away from face-to-face contact with patients to run the new organisations. She wants Lansley to listen to doctors, health experts and patient groups and do things differently. Gerada's outspoken comments are another sign of the mounting concern among senior medical figures. BMA leaders recently warned that Lansley's plans could lead to the fragmentation of the NHS, for example. Lansley, though, is unlikely to pay much heed. A bill to enact the white paper's radical proposals is expected next month. Fears for the future"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
