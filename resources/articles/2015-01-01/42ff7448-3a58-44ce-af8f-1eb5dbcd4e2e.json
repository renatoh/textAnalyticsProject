Students at the all-female liberal arts school Mount Holyoke College have decided to break with a decade-long tradition of putting the play on at Valentine\u2019s Day, arguing that it does not do enough to include transgender people and people of colour. \u201cAt its core, the show offers an extremely narrow perspective on what it means to be a woman,\u201d an email circulated circulated among members of the college\u2019s Project Theatre group states. The note, obtained by the student news website Campus Reform, continues: \u201cGender is a wide and varied experience, one that cannot simply be reduced to biological or anatomical distinctions, and many of us who have participated in the show have grown increasingly uncomfortable presenting material that is inherently reductionist and exclusive.\u201d The Project Theatre chair, Erin Murphy, a 22-year-old senior theatre student at the college, confirmed to the Guardian the email\u2019s authenticity but declined to forward a copy. The play, which premiered in 1996, is now performed all over the world on 14 February to raise awareness of gender-based violence. \u201cI would like to believe that the play is outdated and irrelevant but sadly it isn\u2019t,\u201d Ensler said. \u201cI travel the planet, I\u2019ve just come from many countries and the United States where 51% of the population has vaginas and aren\u2019t able to have agency over those vaginas. We know that one out of every three women will be raped or beaten in her lifetime \u2013 so we know we have a long way to go before vaginas are liberated.\u201d Ensler told the Guardian that while she stood with the students at Mount Holyoke to fight transphobia, she disagreed that the play was in any way transphobic. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to know that I never intended to write a play about what it means to be a woman, that was not what the Vagina Monologues ever intended to be,\u201d Ensler said. \u201cIt was a play about what it means to have a vagina. It never said, for example, the definition of a woman is someone who has a vagina \u2026 I think that\u2019s a really important distinction.\u201d Ensler added: \u201cWhen we use language, we have to be very careful what we say.\u201d The Vagina Monologues is updated to include a new monologue every year. In 2005 Ensler added a new piece, entitled \u201cThey Beat the Girl Out of My Boy\u201d, written entirely from the perspective of a trans person. It has remained an optional piece for inclusion since it was written. \u201cI don\u2019t think inclusion comes from refusing to acknowledge our distinctive experiences or trying to erase them. It comes from listening to our differences and of the right for everyone to talk about their reality \u2013 free from oppression and silencing,\u201d Ensler said. \u201cI think we have to create a space for the over 3 billion women who have vaginas to talk about our vaginas \u2013 the oppressions, and suffering and secrets and pleasures they have \u2013 without it being seen as dominance and transphobia,\u201d Ensler added. \u201cAt the same time I say, as the Mount Holyoke students are saying, that we can\u2019t define gender or womanhood based on anatomy and genitalia, right?\u201d Ensler drew attention to the fact that the play has been designed to include actors of colour. \u201cThousands and thousands of women of colour [have] performed the Vagina Monologues for the last 20 years,\u201d Ensler said, adding that the off-Broadway production featured a woman of colour in each cast for four years straight. Murphy told the Guardian that Project Theatre had performed \u201cThey Beat The Girl Out Of My Boy\u201d in 2010 but have not performed it since. \u201cWe felt that the play didn\u2019t reflect all of the voices of the Mount Holyoke community; as such we decided to create our own,\u201d Murphy said. Mount Holyoke College has recently changed its admissions policy to allow trans people identifying as women to apply for entry. \u201cIn our discussions among the board, we felt that the monologues in the current core that we perform offered one perspective on the experiences of people of colour, women of colour in society \u2013 we totally totally recognise the validity in that. But we felt it was maybe time to hear some other perspectives,\u201d added Murphy. Ensler said: \u201cI celebrate people writing their own plays that unveil and undress sexuality and the dimensions of gender. I think there should be more and more and more plays written about that.\u201d Mara Kieslingis, the founding executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said it was difficult to come down on either side of the debate about the play\u2019s relevance. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can expect any play to be anything other than the writer\u2019s point of view. I do not know if the Vagina Monologues is an exception,\u201d said Kieslingis. \u201cBut colleges also have an obligation to be open, accepting and inclusive to all students.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
