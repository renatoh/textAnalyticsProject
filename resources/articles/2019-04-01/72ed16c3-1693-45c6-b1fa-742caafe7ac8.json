Thanks all for your company and comments \u2013 ta-ra. Ferdinand isn\u2019t sure about Pogba, saying that if you keep him you need to build around him, but that he might want to leave. He says he\u2019d keep Pogba, while Hargreaves says Pogba took too many touches today, but is very effective when playing quickly. Hargreaves says that United need someone to play in front of the back four - Fred played there today and is a ballplayer. Ferdinand notes that when the top players are moving, United might not be first choice, though says if he was a player, he\u2019d be thinking that he might catalyse the comeback. Solskjaer says United started well and that Messi was the difference. He also says that Barca are at the level United need to reach and that they can, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do. \u201cWe want to play these games next season, and we\u2019ve a massive week coming up with Everton, City and Chelsea.\u201d Gulp. What\u2019s happened to United over the last few weeks doesn\u2019t tell us that Solskjaer isn\u2019t the man for the job. To expect championship form for half a season would be ridiculous; United only played this game, and are only in the hunt for top four, because of the work Solskjaer\u2019s done. The job is a big one, and though three brilliant signings could get them close in the league, they\u2019re miles off a team that anyone can deem satisfactory. He also says that United need to try and get back in the top four. More news as i get it. Jesse Lingard says United dominated but didn\u2019t take their chances. He seems absolutely gutted, which is kind of nice in that he turned up expecting to win - the mentality is right, even if the talent isn\u2019t. I love how much Rio Ferdinand loves football. he\u2019s currnely cooing over De Jong and De Ligt. I guess United can take some solace in Ajax\u2019s exploits. Though they do have two generational players in De Ligt and De Jong, they\u2019re also proof that with clever management, the right tactics and a proper mentality, you can do amazing things. Rio Ferdinand agrees that Liverpool have a better shot against Barcelona, but also notes that they don\u2019t have Messi. There\u2019s a bit more to it than that - Dembele will be fitter by then, and Barca\u2019s midfielders are so classy - but if Barca go through it\u2019ll be because Messi takes them through. If anyone fancies a longread about why Solskjaer was a good choice for United manager, and why he\u2019ll probably fail anyway, here, by amazing coincidence, is one. Here\u2019s Danny Taylor\u2019s match report: Ajax have beaten Juventus! What a semi it\u2019ll be against City or Spurs! Read Paul Doyle on that, here. As for United, they\u2019ve still got a chance of making next season\u2019s competition, but will probably have to beat Everton on Sunday. Assuming they lose to City next midweek, they\u2019ll already need Arsenal to drop points in two games and to win all their others. In the longer term, they just need better players - the question is whether the board will pay for them. The evidence of the last 14 years says not, in which case it\u2019s a case of getting the permitted purchases right with no margin for error, and waiting for the younger players to be ready. So what\u2019s next? Well, for Barca, the most likely assignment is a tie with Liverpool, and I\u2019ve no idea how that might go. If Messi turns up, he can ruin any team, but Liverpool\u2019s midfield will make it harder than United\u2019s could simply by virtue of their running power. And their front three are obviously much better than United\u2019s, though the first leg being in Catalunya will help Barca if they can get themselves a lead. They\u2019re still playing in Turin, but Juve need two goals in what\u2019s left of injury-time if they\u2019re to beat Ajax. Barcelona were far, far too good for United tonight. United might\u2019ve made it a more interesting night had they taken their chances in the opening minutes, but once Messi picked the ball up and spirited home that first goal, it was a matter, not of how but how many. He is unfathomably, humiliatingly, inspirationally, epochally wonderful, and we are honoured to be living in his time. This is fairly conclusive. 90+1 min Barcelona barge forward with Vidal, who pokes across to box and Suarez opens his legs to find Messi, seeking his hat-trick; he smashes a shot, but it\u2019s straight at De Gea, who prangs away with an uppercutting arm. 90 min There\u2019ll be two additional minutes. 90 min Here come United! Dalot charges down the right and leaps into a lovely, curling cross at which Sanchez dives, near post; he makes great contact too, and Ter Stegen is off the other way, expecting the ball to Lukaku in the middle. But he does brilliantly to right himself, getting a strong hand to push away. 89 min Suarez, still without a European goal this season, ducks inside Fred then outside - that\u2019s lovely feet - then digs out a chip that sails over the bar. 89 min \u201cWould have been a different story if it was Dundee United at Camp Nou in a European quarter final,\u201d remembers Simon McMahon. \u201cThe past is indeed a foreign country.\u201d Funny you should mention that; I think it was me who said... 87 min \u201cI actually do agree with you on Phil,\u2019 returns Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cWhen he was switched on, he\u2019d harry the opposition, tackle, make interceptions etc. Problem was, you couldn\u2019t count on him to do that every match. Even 3 out of 4 isn\u2019t good enough at this level.\u201d It\u2019s not just that, I don\u2019t think - if you\u2019re going to play on the wing for Barcelona, you need pace and the ability to go on the outside. If you\u2019re going to play in midfield, then you need to be involved all the time. 84 min Barca are sort of looking for a fourth, but not with any edge. United will consider themselves lucky to get out of this with a 3-0, if indeed they do. 82 min \u201cMuch in the way Fergie decided to cut Ince from his first great team after that Barca hammering in 94,\u201d tweets Patrick O\u2019Brien, \u201cdo you reckon Ole might dish out the same treatment to Pogba this summer?\u201d It\u2019s a tricky one, this. On the one hand, if United want to improve, getting rid of their most talented player sounds like a bad move. Buuuuut, Pogba is 26 now, so the player we see is the player he is, and as far as I can see, he\u2019ll only ever be an adornment. In a better team, that\u2019s useful to have - hell, in a crap team it\u2019s still worth a fair few goals and assists a season. But I wonder if it\u2019s possible to balance a midfield with him in it, because he does a number 10\u2019s amount of work without delivering a number 10\u2019s numbers. 81 min And another change for Barca: Coutinho accepts the applause as he leaves, but probably wondering how much of it is actually for Dembele, replacing him. 80 min United get serious: Sanchez replaced Lingard. Now you\u2019ll see something. 79 min Busquets gives it away - I feel honoured to type those words, not many have - and Lingard pounces, driving a curler that\u2019s not that far over the bar. United are coming back into this. 77 min Smalling has the audacity to tackle Suarez, and when the ref fails to give a foul, Suarez is booked for hectoring him. 76 min Ah, I missed Mr O\u2019Hearn\u2019s first tweet, which reads thusly: \u201cMeanwhile, around the globe, sportswriters search their Thesaurus for original ways of expressing \u2018inevitably\u2019, \u2018meekly\u2019 and \u2018surrendered\u2019.\u201d I\u2019m not so sure about that one - I think United have done their best, it\u2019s just that their best is nowhere near good enough. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve not competed hard and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve given up, I just think the game reflects the class imbalance. 75 min Another change for Barca: Vidal replaces Arthur, who\u2019s been excellent tonight. 74 min Suarez arse-wiggles forward, so Fred hitchkicks into a tackle, winning the ball. Suarez reckons it\u2019s a foul, so picks the ball up, and is penalised for handball. He accepts this with typical grace. 73 min \u201cYour comment on Phil Coutinho reminds me of the late NFL coach Buddy Ryan,\u201d tweets Hubert O\u2019Hearn, \u201cwho griped about one of his wide receivers Cris Carter, \u2018All he does is score touchdowns\u2019.\u201d At the elite level, it\u2019s not enough to hammer in a few pearlers, especially in a flowing game like football. Coutinho has a lot of work to do, I\u2019d say, as the only real future for him at Barca is in the midfield three. Oh, and Lukaku replaces Rashford, who\u2019s being saved. 71 min Change for Barca: Semedo replaces Sergi Roberto. 70 min Well! Ajax have scored again in Turin, thorugh De Ligt! Juve now need to score twice! And the Nou Camp crowd absolutely love it. 68 min \u201cMartial\u2019s a weird one,\u201d emails Matt Dony. \u201cThey bought him before the transfer market went (even more) crazy, so the \u00a335m+ fee seemed absolutely hilarious. Then I watched him play as they eased him into the team, and stopped laughing. Especially against Liverpool. Now, it just seems kinda funny again.\u201d He\u2019s got a lot of the raw materials, but doesn\u2019t seem to have the drive and competitive mania that you need. I should say, people think that stuff is easy, and a given - \u201cIf I had the technical skill, I\u2019d run like mad in every game\u201d - but it\u2019s nonsense. Fighters go in the ring having skived in training, which tells you that people skive at anything, and mentality is a skill. Sport is simple, but humans are complicated. 67 min There\u2019s stuff going on in the Premier League: Cardiff are 2-0 up away to Brighton, who are about to close the gap between the clubs to two points, a game in hand, and an easier run-in. 66 min Phil Jones has removed his bandage. Barca are in trouble now. 65 min Change for United: Dalot replaces Martial, who has done a lot of nothing once again. 64 min My word, there\u2019s a long time to go in this game. Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric, as Nas once said. Anyway, Busquets lifts a ball into the box, Messi can;\u2019t quite get at it, but it bounces down and he flips into an overhead that flies just past the far post. 64 min I\u2019m pretty sure United would shake hands on 4-0 here. They should be so lucky. You don\u2019t even need me to describe this! Messi, under no pressure, clips a ball out to Jordi Alba who feeds back inside to Coutinho, 25 yards out, left of centre. He looks up, the unfurls a curler that he places past De Gea and into the roof of the net for another superb goal. And he celebrates with his fingers in his ears and such, but the thing is, everyone knows he can do that - the problem is what, if anything, else he does. 60 min \u201cFrom your MBM,\u201d tweets Sam Jones, \u201cI get the distinct impression that Jones may need to find a darkened room in which to rock back and forth later tonight.\u201d He\u2019s actually not had a terrible game, but what can you do? If I may namedrop, Kevin Pietersen once told me that when England were flayed by Sehwag and Tendulkar in that amazing Test, in the middle of being gutted he realised how lucky he was to be stood at mid off in such close proximity to such unbelievable brilliance. So there\u2019s that. 57 min A long ball down the middle looks like it\u2019s finding Rashford, but he can\u2019t quite arrange his limbs, or there\u2019s too much on it, and Barca break. Suarez finds Messi, gliding towards the United back four, and he opens his body to feed in Coutinho ... but Lindelof rips himself in half stretching to intercept. 55 min Talking of Martial, for how much longer should United persevere with him? He has lovely skill when running with the ball and is a decent finisher too, but likes to receive possession standing still, hardly ever runs in behind, and almost never gambles when a team-mate shoots, to get himself a tap-in. And the thing is, these aren\u2019t difficult problems to solve, requiring will not skill. If he\u2019s not sorted it by now, why will he sort it in the future? 54 min Young curls to the back post, but the ball is too high for Smalling, who can only head up into the air. 54 min Martial runs at Sergi Roberto, who doesn\u2019t know which way to turn as his man weaves inside and outside, eventually glad to concede a corner. 53 min Messi flights his cross into De Gea\u2019s arms. 52 min Jones was that kid who\u2019d take deodorant on his arm til you worried it was gonna burn away. Again, he goes out to meet Messi, sees him go by, and eventually McTominay administers the foul, close to the right corner flag. 49 min In a way, United could use a hiding here - hear me out. The Glazers aren in the crowd, and could do with seeing just how far United are from contending for this trophy. There are other ways to close the gap beyond spending money - good coaching, clever tactics and promoting youth - but that\u2019s not going to be enough. United need to buy two serious midfielders and a right-winger to contend domestically, and if they plan to take on the best, they need a centre-back as well. 48 min Lovely from Barca, Coutinho to Alba, who could pick out Suarez in the middle but instead cuts back for Messi; he opens his body to try a left-footed curler ... De Gea has it covered, but Young extends a leg to deflect behind. The corner comes to nowt. 47 min When Barca went 3-1 up in the 2011 final, with 21 minutes still to go, Rooney asked their players to take it easy. I wonder if anyone fancies doing likewise tonight. 46 min Off we go again... Right then, the players are back... \u201cJust seen the first goal,\u201d tweets Gary Naylor. \u201cFred has to obstruct him and take the yellow once Messi is on his left foot 30 yards from goal doesn\u2019t he? It\u2019s what Fernandinho would have done.\u201d In retrospect, he has to do anything he can, but it happened so quickly that I\u2019m not sure he could\u2019ve done given his body position. Fernandinho has the muscle memory, so is a different case. Half-time email: \u201cAll is not lost for United,\u201d reckons Charles Antaki. \u201cThey have a secret agent in the Barcelona side, i.e. Philippe Coutinho, who is doing exceptionally well at contributing virtually nothing, and giving the ball away in a charitable manner. Apparently he\u2019s looking for a new club in the summer.\u201d I think Barca said yesterday that he\u2019s definitely staying, but I\u2019m not altogether surprised that he\u2019s struggling. First of all, he\u2019s not a winger - least of all in a side who like to stretch the pitch - and he\u2019s a player who can win you a game but won\u2019t really help you control it. if he\u2019s not sticking in brilliant finishes from around the edge of the box, he\u2019s not generally doing that much. I\u2019ve no idea how United approach the second half. Trying to keep the score down isn\u2019t good for business, especially if it doesn\u2019t work out, but trying to fight back is asking for trouble. Exciting! United gave it a brave go in the early stages and has Rashford scored not hit the bar, who knows. Ok, we all do - Barca have Messi, and in the context of this tie - in the context of most ties - that\u2019s enough. 45+1 min Messimessimessimessimessimessimessimessimessimessimessimessimessimessimessi! He comes short and as the ball\u2019s played into him, he feints left then turns right, diddling Jones, before megging him for the lols and zoning forward to find Jordi Alba on his outside. The ensuing cross is a beauty, low and hard for Sergi Roberto at the back post, and he slides in to shoot, but somehow De Gea, making up ground from the other side of his goal, dives to keep it out. That was glorious from all concerned. 45 +1 min There\u2019ll be two added minutes, both of them consumed by Barcelona toying with United and ball. 45 min \u201cUnited\u2019s light rose away shirt looks like watered-down Palermo to me,\u201d reckons Peter Oh. \u201cAnyway, about the scoreline. Bar\u00e7a are sitting pretty now, ain\u2019t they?\u201d The kit looks like when Tracy in Jossy\u2019s Giants washed their white away kit with her hockey bibs. 44 min Rashford smashes into the wall. And before you ask me for predictions of equivalent soothsaying, tomorrow is Wednesday. 43 min Pogba scythes through midfield and Rakitic slides him down; free-kick United, 25 yards out, just left of the D. Rashford looks like he\u2019s having it, so presumably will smash into the wall.. 41 min Barca win a free-kick down the right 30 yards from goal, and Messi picks out Rakitic at the near post, running from out to in; no one bothers to go with him, but he can only guide a header straight at De Gea. That\u2019s a spectacular save, by the standard. 41 min \u201cYou say Messi is better on grass,\u201d tweets Michael Hann, \u201cbut to paraphrase a now-disgraced American athlete, has he ever smoked AstroTurf?\u201d I think he\u2019s more a 3G man, man. 40 min Slightly better from United, Rashford finding space down the left after a few consecutive passes and nicking away from Rakitic to drive a low cross, but Lenglet is there to clear. 38 min United\u2019s first attack in sometime and Pogba, who seems to lost his goals from range in the elan black-hole that is post-Fergie United, dribbles an effort straight at Ter Stegen. 37 min There\u2019s a tie brewing in Turin! Van de Beek has equalised for Ajax, who now need to score once to force Juve to score twice! 36 min Pogba tries to force the issue, close to halfway but inside his own half, and takes a succession of hacks at Arthur. Gosh, he really showed everyone. 35 min Messi fancies a shot - he wants to put De Gea under pressure again, I shouldn\u2019t wonder - and who\u2019s about to argue with him? But he wafts over the bar, and United try to do something, anything. 34 min Barca are enjoying this, popping the ball about as United struggle to stop them. Fred pulls Rakitic back, then catches the back of his heel, and Barca have a free-kick about 40 yards out, dead centre. 33 min United have not had decent possession for quite sometime. While we wait for Barca to score again, what on earth is wrong with David de Gea? His kicking has gone, he\u2019s never dominated his box less, and he\u2019s making more errors than once. His reactions are still immense, but this has not been a good season for him. 31 min Another one to crtl c, ctrl v: Ronaldo has scored for Juventus against Ajax, putting them 2-1 up on aggregate. His record in the knockout stages of this competition is absolutely obscene - though Messi is obviously better on grass, you can make a strong case that he is better on paper. 30 min It\u2019s been bothering me, who Messi reminds me of. Not anymore. 28 min A quiet period, which is the respite United needed. 26 min Jordi Alba has started the game brilliantly, and Lindelof is struggling to handle him and Coutinho with no help. He breaks down the left again and finds Rakitic, who clips into the box; Messi is first to the ball and nicks it away in a trice before panelling a shot over the bar. 24 min Barca are playing a back three now, with Busquets between Lenglet and Pique - at least when United have the ball. Which isn\u2019t that often, at the moment. 23 min \u201cThe most remarkable thing about Larsson\u2019s spellat Man United,\u201d emails Simon McMahon, is that it was IN 2007!!! Time really does speed up the older you get. Soon I\u2019ll be eating breakfast every five minutes.\u201d This sounds like an excellent ruse, and well worth wearing a suit to go to the newsagent. 22 min \u201cThe \u2018Walking\u2019 in \u2018Walking to Glory\u2019 sounds like a schoolchild\u2019s go at translating \u2018Caminando\u2019,\u201d advises Charles Antaki, \u201cbut to be fair, caminar can mean to walk, but also, presumably more appropriately, moving or, better marching. Here endeth the evening class Spanish lesson, misremembered from a very long time ago.\u201d Er, I think this one might just be over. McTominay and Fred do well to unload Coutinho, but the ball breaks for Messi, who eyes up Jones and quickly swerves away, as you would, before hitting a pretty tame right-footer over which De Gea somehow dives, allowing it to squirm under him and in. This could get, er, messy. 18 min United now need to score twice, as they were always going to have to. The problem is that they\u2019ve not finished conceding. He is so, so, so, so, so good. Deep inside his own half and close to the touchline, Young hangs onto the ball for what seems like 10 minutes then eventually loses it and Messi pounces then megs Fred, of course he does, then Jones sells himself, of course he does, and suddenly Messi\u2019s central and with a clear sight of goal. Naturally, he measures a perfect, low, curling finish into the far corner for a perfectly routine piece of association football by his ludicrous standard. 15 min Alba goes down the left and swings over a fine cross; Suarez is just adjusting his position at the back post to cushion home the opener and race off celebrating, parading his magnificence in front of all his friends, when Jones pokes out a head to send the ball away. Excellent de-fence. 14 min United are in this game, Rashford screeching at Pique and making an angle for a shot, only to slip in the process of applying it. Ter Stegem saves easily, but United are finding space without much difficulty here. 12 min We restart with a drop-ball in the United box - I\u2019 not sure how Rakitic has got away with that - and it goes behind for a goalkick. The ref goes to look at the screen, sees what happened, and reverses his decision. Given for Fred\u2019s foul on Rakitic, but that\u2019s never one \u201cfor me\u201d. Fred gets in front of his man, stands his ground and moves the ball away, as Rakitic vaults over him. I think we\u2019ll see this overturned, which is funny because the ref was so pleased with himself when he awarded it, contemptuously shaking his head when the United players appealed. 10 min In defence, United\u2019s first line has Lingard in the middle and Rashford on the right. But the pattern of things has changed slightly, Barca pushing and United looking to break; Pogba has to clear another corner, and... 8 min Alba makes his first foray forward and wins a corner off Jones. United get it away and Sergi Roberto crosses from the right, but Smalling is up to chuck a go-go gadget neck which gets rid well. 7 min \u201cMissed all the build up,\u201d emails Matt Dony, \u201cjust caught the first couple of minutes. Barcelona are in pink, yeah?\u201d This really is very strange. United are pushing the pace, and not only that, but playing with some quality. 6 min Martial and Lingard link, the latter scurrying into the box after a bouncing ball, and forcing three defenders to hack about til one of them sees it away. And back come United! 5 min \u201cALDI\u2019s interesting new beer is a hitherto unsuspected 6.8%,\u201d says Geoff Wignall, \u201cand I\u2019ve been up since 5:00a.m; wanna fight? (He says from the safety of central Portugal).\u201d Hold me back, hold me back. 4 min ... Young hits the first man, ctrl c, ctrl v. 4 min This is a fine start from United, and Rashford wins a corner down the right... 3 min United come again and this time McTominay breaks through the middle, but can\u2019t quite gather Rashford\u2019s pass into his stride. If he had, he was in. 2 min Jones is playing centre-back, with Lindelof on the right, and here comes Coutinho down the left; Smalling dhalsims into a fine sliding tackle. 1 min Marcus Rashford hits the bar! United enjoy some nice possession, moving the ball with tempo, and Pogba flips a ball around the corner for Rashford! He\u2019s in behind, but doesn\u2019t have a great angle, so jabs a dink over Ter Stegen and onto the face of the bar! 1 min United are all over them! 1 min United get us away. For those watching in black and white, they\u2019re wearing the pink shirts. Ashley Young and Leo Messi shake hands, then hug. I can only assume Young promised a mate he\u2019d achieve that. Uefa gets lots wrong, but: Ce sont les meilleures \u00e9quipes Es sind die allerbesten Mannschaften The main event Die Meister Die Besten Les grandes \u00e9quipes The champions Une grande r\u00e9union Eine grosse sportliche Veranstaltung The main event Die Meister Die Besten Les grandes \u00e9quipes The champions Ils sont les meilleurs Sie sind die Besten These are the champions \u201cWALKING TO GLORY\u201d reads a banner behind the goal, which seems like a lot of trouble to go to for what is, let\u2019s be real, a slogan that\u2019s mediocre at best and dying to be misread at worst. Here they come! The noise is pretty aight. The Barca anthem starts up and the flags start going. Things are warming up, and the players are in the tunnel, Phil Jones with a bandage around his head, presumably to stop brain seeping out. They\u2019ve been absolutely blasting the tunes at Camp Nou \u2013 someone had the brainwave to put on Eye of the Tiger, bound to end in disappointment when Raymond van Barneveld didn\u2019t show. Tangentially, I saw the weirdest pre-match entertainment I\u2019ve ever seen at Camp Nou, and this was it \u2013 feel free to send in your favourites too. \u201cDid Saha\u2019s increasing injury problems not do more to disrupt his partnership with Rooney in 06/07 than on-loan Henrik?\u201d asks Booboo76. Those didn\u2019t help. But if you look through January and February 2007, you\u2019ll see Larsson starting, Saha on the bench, goals drying up and performances deteriorating. \u201cYou could have a fight about whether Sergi Roberto is more defensive than Semedo,\u201d emails Charles Antaki. \u201cRoberto has more experience playing in the middle (and indeed everywhere else) for the team (and for the national team), while Semedo, though faster, seems naturally glued to the touchline. Both do crosses, to be sure, but Roberto can also come in a bit, and can score a goal or two. (Inevitably, watch as he never leaves his half, and scores an own goal).\u201d I could have a fight about anything. Who wants a straightener? Rio Ferdinand says he hopes Solskjaer is lying about an open game, and trying to psyche Barca out. I\u2019m inclined to agree, because if United try to get out in midfield, they\u2019re getting passed around. Ole speaks: \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to get it started ... be disciplined, work harder than ever, ride our luck ... but we need more quality than last Wednesday ... express ourselves.\u201d He also reckons United have a better chance in an open game and says United can\u2019t sit back and wait for errors - \u201cwe need to go a little bit at them\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve picked a team we think can solve most of the problems they can set us, but we can\u2019t afford to have five at the back.\u201d \u201cCamp Nou &amp; OT are the same size,\u201d chides Christopher Smith, \u201cat least per Wikipedia (which also currently has the stadium being demolished by Ole and the boys tonight, mind you).\u201d My favourite 80s prog-country band, by far. I guess the size of the ground make it look bigger, same way, to paraphrase John Toshack, time passes more slowly in the Bernabeu. Tangentially, I\u2019d forgotten until yesterday that before the 99 final, Bayern successfully lobbied to have the pitch narrowed. If only they\u2019d applied that same attention to detail to their finishing. Rio Ferdinand reckons United can take their time in this game, and I agree. Even if they go one down, well, the likelihood is they need to score twice anyway. And they\u2019re capable of that, but they\u2019ll need to play a lot better than they did last week, where they just lacked the class and cohesion around the box. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve been practising some set-piece moves, but they also need to improve their give and goes. or should that be gives and go, I don\u2019t know. OK, go on. Let\u2019s cast our footballing Game of Thrones. I can think of about 1063 Joffreys. Owen Hargreaves took United\u2019s first leg defeat hard. Henrik Larsson is on the pitch with Des Kelly, so an unpopular opinion: he was an absolutely useless signing for United. He scored only one crucial goal, and because Fergie was so smug about the situation, he disturbed the Rooney-Saha partnership and that team was never as electrifying again. Barcelona haven\u2019t lost a European home game in six years, and in that time they\u2019ve never conceded more than once. In fairness, though, they\u2019ve never come up against your Freds and your Lingards. \u201cJust seen the lineups,\u201d emails my colleague Paul Doyle.\u201d Out of interest, what\u2019s United\u2019s biggest ever defeat in Europe?\u201d I can answer that! I can answer that! The lost 5-0 to Sporting Clube in the 63-64 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, having won the first leg 4-1. As it happens, I think the line-up is more or less United\u2019s strongest in the circumstances. I might\u2019ve played Dalot at right-back and gone with five defenders, leaving out Martial. But we\u2019re rearranging the deckchairs, I suppose. On BT, they\u2019re rhapsodising Scott McTominio. Hargreaves says that he had a good game for Bayern against Madrid in the 01 semi, and that made his career; he reckons the same has just happened to McTominio. And he\u2019s a funny one. Last season, I concede, I saw almost nothing in him - it looked like Mourinho was trying to replace Pogba with the worst possible player to wind him up the maximum extent. But he\u2019s played with much more dynamism and authority recently, to suggest that he can at least be a squad player. For United to be relying on him tonight, though, should shame every other midfielder at the club. \u201cFCB could take MUFC to the cleaners here tonight,\u201d predicts John McEnerney. \u201cFirst leg they showed their class in possession this evening they\u2019ll show their teeth and boy what a set of gnashers they have! They\u2019ll come bursting out of the gates and hit United early &amp; then take them apart! 4-0 or 5.\u201d I\u2019m not sure about that. I\u2019d expect Barca to be circumspect early on because they\u2019ve no need to force the issue and won\u2019t want to expose their defence. Obviously they\u2019re much better than United, but I\u2019d expect them to ease to a 2-0. A back-four featuring Alas Smalling and Jones, plus Ashley Young, in the year 2019 C.E. \u2013 absolutely remarkable. \u201cA refreshing absence of half-and-half scarves in the preamble photo, I must say,\u201d emails Peter Oh. \u201cI imagine that Marcus Rashford will be particularly motivated to impress. Which side, I\u2019m not sure. In any case, it should be an entertaining game and I look forward to following it on your Mes Que Un Blog.\u201d A Euro away is probably the place that they\u2019re least unacceptable. I\u2019m not sure the game will be so entertaining, though - that doesn\u2019t especially suit either side. United have had a win already - Coutinho starting instead of Dembele is to their advantage. I\u2019ve a feeling he might like a look at United\u2019s full-backs; heyzoos, I\u2019ve a feeling I\u2019d like a look at United\u2019s full-backs. Just the one change from the first leg for Barcelona, and it\u2019s a defensive one: Sergi Roberto is in for Nelson Semedo. As for United, Jones comes in at right-back with Young moving left to cover the suspended Shaw; I\u2019m a little surprised Dalot isn\u2019t playing, because Coutinho isn\u2019t much into running back and Jordi Alba leaves space in behind. In front of them, the midfield is the same, with McTominao set to dominate once more while, up front, Lingard and Martial are in - in theory that makes sense, because both have pace and skill, but in reality is a gamble, because both are in rotten nick - and Lukaku drops out. That is unsurprising, because when the ball goes forward, it\u2019ll need to stick, and if a chance comes, it\u2019ll need taking. Barcelona (a matter of principle 4-3-3): Ter Stegen; Sergi Roberto, Piqu\u00e9, Lenglet, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Arthur; Messi, Su\u00e1rez y Coutinho. Subs: Cillessen, Semedo, Umtitti, Alena, Vidal, Malcolm, Dembele. Manchester United (a theoretical 4-3-3): De Gea; Jones, Lindel\u00f6f, Smalling, Young; McTominay, Pogba, Fred; Lingard, Martial, Rashford. Subs: Romero, Dalot, Matic, Mata, Pereira, Sanchez, Lukaku. For Manchester United fans, the last few months have been the most uplifting since Alex Ferguson retired and winter came. A low bar, admittedly, but nonetheless: where once there was Jos\u00e9, now there is hop\u00e9. But is there really? If you think this has a happy ending, then you haven\u2019t been paying attention. Never before has there been a season which, at this late stage, retains the capacity for such multifarious awfulness \u2013 verily, the night is dark and full of terrors. And, at the end of it, Manchester City might win a domestic treble, something Manchester United have never managed; or they might win the actual treble something Manchester United have managed; or they might win absolutely everything. Alternatively, Liverpool might win their first league in 29 years, perhaps thanks to a helping hand from United; or Liverpool might win their first league in 29 years, perhaps thanks to a helping hand from United, then add to it a sixth European Cup; or Liverpool might share every trophy with City, a sweep culminating in a European Cup final that, for United fans, will forever be known as the Battle of the Bastards. And yet, the question begs: do United even want to win tonight? A silly question, you might think, but stick with me. What happens if their reward for so doing is a pumping from Liverpool, who then go on to reclaim Ol Big Ears? Or what happens if they somehow sneak by Liverpool as well, only to be brutally murdered by quadruple-chasing City in the final, their very own red wedding. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. Of course, these are all worstest case scenarios. More likely, United subside gently this evening and then hope that Ronaldo and Messi can, between them, limit the season to a straight, upstanding worst. The Nou Camp pitch is wide, and it\u2019s hard to see how United can cover all of it, at the same time as keeping Messi, Suarez and Dembele quiet, at the same time as finding a goal or two for themselves. But, at 1-0, they\u2019re not entirely out of things - leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe. The thing is, that though Barca are good, they\u2019re not that good - the same issues that make them unreliable insurance also render them slightly vulnerable Their defence is far from the tightest, their midfield is slow, and in Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford, United have players able to trouble any team \u2013 on a good day. Today will need to be their best day. Dracarys! Kick-off: 8pm BST"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
