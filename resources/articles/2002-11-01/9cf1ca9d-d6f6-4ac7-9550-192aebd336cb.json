The midfielder, who scored the goal which beat Holland and took the Republic to the Far East, said: \"We're all shocked - it's a sad day for Irish football. \"I've spoken to a couple of the other lads (including team-mate Kevin Kilbane) and we're shocked.\" McAteer, recovering from a groin operation, also thought the media played a major part in McCarthy's decision. He continued on Sky Sports News: \"The power of the pen is mighty in this day and age - the majority of journalists never wanted him to have the job and they have given him a tough time. \"They took any chance they had to stick the knife in his back. Tonight they will be happy but there are a lot of unhappy players. \"We're a small nation. I went to the World Cup in 1994 with Ireland and the media hype around the team was not that great compared to England or Spain. \"This summer was the same, but once the Roy Keane thing happened the world's media was on us and the questions were coming left, right and centre. \"Mick never kicked him out, Roy took the decision and it's unfair Mick's going to take the stick for it.\" He added: \"Look at the Ireland team - we've got a handful of world-class players, players such as Damian Duff and Robbie Keane. \"The rest - me included - are not world-class but we all muck in together. Mick got us to the World Cup and that's the pinnacle of our careers. \"Irish football is healthier than it has been for years.\"l"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
