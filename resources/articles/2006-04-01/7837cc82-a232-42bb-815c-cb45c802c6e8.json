They were walking back home along a country lane when their attacker struck. Josie remembered that a car zoomed past them forcing them to step aside. A man, armed with a claw hammer, got out of the car, and demanded money from Dr Russell. She urged Josie to run, but he caught her. He then tore up one of the girls' swimming towels and tied up all three of them. The man, Michael Stone, blindfolded the family and then battered them with the hammer in a 15-minute ordeal in the copse near Chillenden. Megan and Dr Russell were killed. Josie endured at least 15 blows to her head. He left her for dead, and she stayed tied to a tree for more than eight hours before being found. Remarkably, despite her severe head injuries, Josie survived. It was months before she could speak coherently again. But after almost a year of coaxing interviews, police were able to draw out of her a detailed account of the attack. The case caused widespread revulsion, as the media and public demanded to know why Stone - who was finally convicted of murdering Dr Russell and Megan - had been allowed to roam free despite having a psychopathic personality disorder. Reportedly, he had been left free to commit his terrible crimes because his disorder was considered by the authorities to be untreatable and therefore he could not be detained under the Mental Health Act. Jack Straw, who was then home secretary, launched a vehement attack on psychiatrists, claiming they were refusing to handle \"untreatable\" patients. Angry psychiatrists responded by accusing the politicians of grandstanding when the state of the law was to blame. Stone's sister, Barbara, claimed that her brother had \"been very seriously let down by health and social services\". She has said: \"If he'd had the care he needed he wouldn't be behind bars now.\" Robert Francis QC was commissioned by the authorities in 1999 to investigate how Stone was being looked after just before he committed the murders. As well as having a long history of mental illness, he was a heroin addict and had a lengthy record of violent crime, which included armed robbery, stabbings and muggings. The Guardian understands that the suppressed report paints a graphic picture of just what a frightening figure Stone presented. Since the age of 17, he had been saying he would kill someone; he kept a rottweiler - and a sword to defend himself from the dog. A \"procession of professionals\" had made statements that included: \"The most dangerous man I have ever dealt with\"; \"Will commit violent crimes in the future\"; \"Will probably stab and murder someone\"; \"Society needs protecting from him.\" In 1992, four years before the Russell murders, Stone told doctors he felt like \"killing children in the woods\". The next year he heard \"voices telling me to stab someone\". He said: \"I could easily put a hammer in someone's head.\" In the days before his medication was due, he was on record as saying that he wanted to \"lash out\". But one doctor thought anti-psychotic drugs were causing his instability rather than mitigating it. Stone abused, lied to and threatened doctors. He threatened violent robberies to obtain painkillers and other drugs, and registered with various doctors under different names. It is understood that the report concludes that there had been \"failure by all agencies\" involved. No key worker was appointed to handle Stone and those involved tried to divert responsibility to others. The prison where Stone had previously served a sentence was \"lax and unaccountable\" and had made no follow-up arrangements because Stone refused to say where he was living. One doctor is described in the report as \"ignorant\" and \"substandard\". Stone, now 45, tried hard to overturn his conviction. He was found guilty in 1998 of the two murders and the attempted murder of Josie, but appealed and the conviction was quashed in 2001. A retrial later that year again found him guilty of the crimes, and his second appeal failed last year. Meanwhile, Josie and her father, Shaun, moved from Kent to a village in north Wales. Initially she struggled at school. At the age of 11, because of the attack, she had not managed to get beyond the reading age of a five-year-old. Now, at 18, she has passed eight GCSEs and is halfway through her college course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
