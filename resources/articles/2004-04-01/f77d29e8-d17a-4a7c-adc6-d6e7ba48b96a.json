Ian Davidson, who is also chairman of Labour Against the Euro, today signalled that he intends to launch a new parliamentary campaign group called Labour Against A Superstate. In doing so he puts himself squarely against the Labour leadership, which has spent the past 12 months denying the need for a referendum on the treaty. Both main opposition parties are calling for a referendum, although from radically different standpoints. The Tories would urge a \"no\" vote, while Charles Kennedy's party is in favour of accepting the constitution, but wants the British people to give it their approval first. The draft constitution was resurrected at last month's European summit in Brussels with leaders agreeing to set a deadline of June 17 for a deal. Mr Davidson would not say how many Labour MP and peers may join his group, but insisted it had \"much wider support than you'd expect\". He said the group - the first news of which was announced in the Sun newspaper, which is also campaigning for a referendum - would be launched formally in the next few weeks. He added: \"All we have on our side is the facts, the truth and the people. As with the euro, we will want to win the argument and win people over.\" Although the group would also admit pro-constitution Labour representatives who merely saw the need for a referendum, Mr Davidson himself said he would vote \"no\" if the question was put to a vote. \"Our main objection is that the constitution would hand more powers and influence to Brussels,\" he said. \"People in Britain signed up in a referendum to joining a single market. They did not sign up to handing over substantial powers to Brussels to create a superstate.\" Mr Davidson said the EU must deal with its corruption and financial problems as well as showing it can adequately use the powers it already has before being given more power under a constitution. He insisted the group was not anti-Europe. \"We support Britain's continued membership of the EU and we want to work with our fellow Europeans,\" he said. \"None of us is looking for British withdrawal.\" The Glasgow Pollock MP said the group would not have a huge membership. But he said that did not mean it would not have widespread support. \"We are the ones putting our heads above the parapet,\" he said. \"But there will be much larger numbers of people encouraging us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
