It is thought that the organising committee will announce details of the deal shortly, possibly by the end of the month. Lloyds TSB and EDF Energy are already signed up to the top-level sponsorship programme, which is crucial to the organising committee's chances of meeting its target of \u00a32bn in revenue, and a third major player will be revealed imminently. In a further sign that the commercial programme is proceeding well, the London organising committee hopes to have at least two further top-line partners by the end of the year, leaving just three to fill. London have announced they are seeking sponsors in eight categories and, with banking and utilities already taken, vacancies remain in the sportswear, airline, automotive, telecoms, oil and gas, and clothing and homeware categories. The chief executive, Paul Deighton, intends to have all eight signed up by the time the Beijing Olympics start next summer, making London the first city to have its commercial programme so well advanced four years before the Games. London have been pleased with the interest in the opportunity, and maintain that the sponsorship represents value for money even though at roughly $100m (\u00a350m) a London-specific sponsorship costs around the same as a global deal with the International Olympic Committee. Darling of the Games In a clear indication of the government's Olympic priorities the chancellor of the exchequer, Alistair Darling, has replaced Jack Straw as chairman of the cabinet committee that monitors the project. Straw, now the justice minister, chaired \"Miscellaneous 25\" from the inception of the bid until Tony Blair's departure from No10 but, with concerns over the Games budget dominating government thinking, Gordon Brown has asked his successor at No11 to take control. Kent get Twenty20 vision The Twenty20 champions, Kent, are expected to be invited to join a Twenty20 champions' league proposed by the Indian cricket board. The BCCI was backed by the ECB and New Zealand this week to push ahead with a venture it hopes will take the sting from the breakaway one-day league being set up by the Indian broadcaster Zee TV. The BCCI is so grateful for ECB backing that it is said to have endorsed the deputy chairman Mike Soper's campaign for the ECB chair. With Somerset's chairman, Giles Clarke, thought to be ahead, Soper could do with assistance but it is doubtful that county chairmen would be swayed by an overseas board in an election that swings on parochial concerns. Rugby image problem The row between the International Rugby Board and the international media shows no signs of abating on the eve of the World Cup. The IRB has accused news organisations of spreading misinformation in a row over the use of images, while many journalists have been instructed not to sign accreditation documents. The IRB claims it is protecting its broadcast partners but the news media accuse it of trying to monetise every scrap of content. The IRB certainly had no qualms about cashing in on England's success in 2003, when it upped the price for footage of Jonny Wilkinson's winning drop-goal from \u00a31,100 to \u00a36,500 overnight. FA casts a wide net The Football Association will advertise the post of independent chairman on Sunday as the search for Geoff Thompson's successor gathers momentum. Headhunters Odgers have been retained to find candidates with the right blend of business experience and political acumen but it is hoped the ad may bring in some unexpected candidates. Insiders claim there is not yet a preferred candidate but it is likely the FA will look outside football for a figure who has true independence from the game. A combination of business pedigree and grassroots affiliation - the formula that helped Ed Warner become chairman of UK Athletics - may be a winning one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
