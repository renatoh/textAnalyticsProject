Photograph: Dennis Gottlieb/Getty In today's G2 chefs and other experts share their top barbecue tips. From beery marinades to plank-cooked fish, there are some really unusual ideas to fire the imagination. I was particularly taken with the image of the British Barbecue champions spritzing their meat with organic apple juice to keep it moist - it's the attention to detail that marks out a winner ... A bit of preparation can certainly pay dividends. Burgers are all very well (in fact, they can be delicious), but nothing in my experience can top the time I roasted a boned leg of lamb. We'd doused it in a yoghurt-based marinade for two days, and we served it wrapped in flat bread with a good dollop of salsa verde, made the day before to let the flavours develop. It was definitely worth the effort. There's a difference, though, between making an extra effort and pointless messing about. Essentially, our lamb dish was still the standard barbecue formula: meat + bread + sauce. I think the essence of barbecuing is simplicity - but the Gastro Alfresco team beg to differ. They're championing \"Gastro Grilling\" over barbecuing, and swordfish over sausages. Isn't this just fixing something that isn't broken? Anyone who has cooked their own freshly caught mackerel after a fishing trip will have experienced that glorious 'back to nature' feeling that a good barbecue should engender. Surely a plentiful species like mackerel, line-caught in British waters, is a more appetising option than swordfish of questionable sustainability, or this year's fashionable BBQ ingredient, far-flung king prawns? Dessert is also made simple on the barbecue: last week we grilled some pineapple slices until they were super-sweet and caramelised, and ate them unadorned. In fact, one of my most memorable desserts was eaten around a barbecue on a camping holiday with friends. Someone produced a few squishy bananas from the bottom of their rucksack, and someone else selflessly sacrificed a Mars bar. We stuffed each banana with a slice or two of chocolate, and warmed them in their skins on the dying embers. Gooey banana and molten chocolate, eaten with the fingers: no spun-sugar concoction could be better. So what do you cook on the barbecue? A six-course gourmet feast or a few burnt bangers? Some local rare-breed pork chops or an exotic ostrich steak? Maybe you've got some great tips to rival our experts, or maybe the weather has made you forego al fresco eating altogether? Britain - officially Europe's 'biggest BBQ nation', apparently - needs to know."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
