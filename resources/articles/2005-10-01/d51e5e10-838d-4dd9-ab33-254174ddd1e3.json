With the economy growing at its slowest pace for more than a decade, and the Treasury's rosy forecasts out by a mile, Gordon Brown's claim to have beaten boom and bust and transformed Britain's economy looks increasingly shaky. The Chancellor's admission in Washington last week that his March forecasts for GDP growth were far too optimistic intensified doubts about his credibility. Brown had vehemently defended the Treasury's forecast of 3 to 3.5 per cent growth against IMF criticism just five months earlier; but the Treasury now reckons that 2 per cent looks ambitious. Brown blamed high oil prices, and the sorry state of the eurozone economies. But much of the slowdown is home-grown. Britain's consumers, who have spent their cash heroically through the past five years and helped to keep the economy afloat, seem to have decided it's time for a touch of prudence - once a favourite mantra of Brown himself. Government figures show the 'savings ratio' - the proportion of their post-tax income households don't spend - has risen sharply since late last year, from 4.1 per cent to 5 per cent. In other words, consumers are blowing less cash in the shops and putting more away. There are plenty of explanations for that. Perhaps scare stories about paltry pensions have persuaded people to save more. The end of the long housing market boom no doubt hasn't helped either; and high oil prices have almost certainly made things worse. More expensive petrol and higher heating bills leave people less to spend on other things. Whatever the cause, retailers are having their toughest time for at least 22 years, according to a CBI survey. A consumer slowdown upsets the high street giants and hurts a whole swathe of industries, from advertisers to hairdressers. But it needn't send the economy into freefall, if other businesses take up the running: by selling goods to countries where consumers are more enthusiastic, for example, or by splashing out on new plants and equipment. The problem for the economy, and for Brown's scorecard, is that this isn't happening. Britain's businesses have repeatedly failed to benefit from the strength of growth elsewhere in the world. And despite his exhortations for firms to rise to the 'China challenge', the Chancellor is increasingly being blamed for the failure of the corporate sector to take over where consumers have left off. 'The IMF's view is that the world economy this year and next will grow at 4.5 per cent, which is staggering. That suggests that if we're slowing, it's a domestic problem - it's a failure of policy,' says Vince Cable, the Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman. 'What's happened to Gordon Brown is that after eight years of success, the cracks are showing.' The Tories, too, are keen to paint Brown as a Chancellor out of touch with the modern challenges faced by businesses. Shadow chancellor George Osborne points to the fact that Britain has slipped in the world competitiveness league, and described Labour's policies as 'like the silt going down the river, and slowing it down'. Danny Gabay, of consultancy Fathom, says the household spending splurge that has kept the economy afloat has masked Brown's failure to tackle many of the shortcomings of Britain's industrial sector, the major task he set himself when he handed interest rate policy over to the Bank of England. 'Over-reliance on the consumer has flattered to deceive,' he says. 'There are two separate issues. The cyclical slowdown is the Bank of England's responsibility. Where Gordon Brown is much more vulnerable is that because he has given the cycle over to the Bank, then the supply-side is his responsibility; and in eight years, there's scant evidence that much has happened there.' Productivity, which Brown made the Treasury's raison d'etre, grew at its slowest rate for 14 years in the second quarter. Businesses have become increasingly sceptical. Firms are profoundly grateful for the gift of economic stability he gave them when he made the Bank independent; but they blame him for making it harder to run a profitable business in 21st-century Britain. 'When the Chancellor says we have avoided boom and bust, that is admittedly true,' says Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI. 'The macroeconomic side of things, business would say it was very pleased with. But profitability is under severe pressure.' He blames the 'profit squeeze' partly on the flood of low-cost goods from China and India, but partly on Brown's policies. 'Companies in the US haven't got the tax burden we have,' he says. 'They don't face as much regulation.' He says promises of a 'bonfire' of regulation must be acted on urgently. 'There's a feeling that there's still been too much red tape coming through; too much micro-management,' agrees the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, David Frost, who says his members, especially in manufacturing, are 'clearly nervous' about the current slowdown. There are also criticisms from the other end of the corporate food chain. 'We welcome low interest rates,' says Stephen Alambritis, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses. 'On the downside, it's the tendency to regulate.' In the City, too, where Brown and Blair worked hard to overcome the money men's suspicion of a Labour administration, the Chancellor's sparkle has gradually diminished, especially since he abandoned the tight Tory spending plans of his first two years. 'For the first three to four years, people were saying, \"He's doing very well - he's Mr Prudent,\"says Ruth Lea, of the Thatcherite think-tank the Centre for Policy Studies. 'But since the floodgates opened on spending in 2000, and the deterioration of the public finances since 2002, that's very much changed his reputation.' Tax rises are now a less pressing fear than they were before the election. Because of some statistical fancy-footwork from Treasury number-crunchers, the looming 'black hole' in the public finances has moved into the next economic cycle, a couple of years away. 'Will Brown put taxes up in the next year or couple of years? I would put money on it that he won't,' says Lea. But this summer's latest rejigging of the measurement of his 'golden rule' raised tricky questions about whether it is really an economic straitjacket or just a political tool. Most analysts still believe that eventually, either public spending will have to be cut, or taxes will have to rise, by up to \u00a310bn a year. Few economists believe that the current downturn is the start of a serious shakeout - and even fewer are mentioning the word 'recession'. But the squeals of business will make it easier for Brown's opponents to paint him as dirigiste and out of touch; and when the reckoning in the public finances finally arrives, someone will have to pay the price. It's a measure of the nervousness in the Treasury that cynics in the Brown camp believe one reason for Blair's tight grip on power is the faint hope that the slowdown will undermine the Chancellor's claim to have transformed the economy. Most economists think the the tide of the Brown boom has already turned. 'Some of Brown's urgency isn't just impatience,' says Gabay. 'He's thinking, \"I've got to get in there, before it's too late\".'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
