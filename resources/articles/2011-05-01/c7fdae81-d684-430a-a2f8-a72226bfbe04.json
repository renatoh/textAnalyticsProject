Opened in 2010, rooms feature crisp white linens, parquet floors, and high-end amenities such as iPads and a thoughtfully chosen selection of gourmet snacks in the minibar. Request one of the \"City K\" rooms with a king size bed. \u2022 96 quai de Jemmapes, 10th, +33 1 8362 5550, lecitizenhotel.com. M\u00e9tro: Jacques Bonsergent. Doubles from \u20ac179 H\u00f4tel Mansart Even blas\u00e9 Parisians will be impressed with your ritzy address just off the posh place Vend\u00f4me. Rooms lean toward the spacious side for a hotel in this price range, with d\u00e9cor classically Parisian and elegant in some rooms and more luxuriously contemporary in others if you're willing to splash out a bit more cash. Oil paintings, antique furnishings and Toile de Jouy fabrics are paired with mod cons such as free Wi-Fi and air conditioning in each room. \u2022 5 rue des Capucines, 1st, +33 1 4261 5028, paris-hotel-mansart.com. M\u00e9tro: Op\u00e9ra. Doubles from \u20ac145 Hostellerie du Marais Ancient wooden beams, exposed stone walls and a decidedly medieval style prevail in the old fashioned lobby, but the rooms in this recently renovated boutique hotel in the Marais district feature a contemporary new design with air conditioning, flatscreen TVs, and sleek fixtures. The juxtaposition suits the neighbourhood's unique mix of upscale shops, art galleries and 17th-century aristocratic mansions. Book a room on the top floor for views over Paris rooftops (and less traffic noise). \u2022 30 rue de Turenne, 3rd, +33 1 4272 7347, hostelleriedumarais.com. M\u00e9tro: Chemin Vert. Doubles from \u20ac112 Castex H\u00f4tel Also in the Marais, the Castex makes the most of its 17th-century setting of old tile floors, wood beamed ceilings and exposed stone walls with wrought iron decorative flourishes and solid dark wood furnishings. The result is surprisingly minimalist without feeling sparse, and cosy without feeling stuffy. As in many budget hotels, what you gain in historical cachet you lose in space, but the central Paris location just a block from the Bastille M\u00e9tro and easy walking distance to Notre Dame and the place des Vosges will do wonders to help you forget the cramped shower stall. \u2022 5 rue Castex, 4th, +33 1 4272 3152, castexhotelparis.com. M\u00e9tro: Bastille. Doubles from \u20ac160 H\u00f4tel Amour One of the first designer budget hotels is still going strong in the South Pigalle (aka \"SoPi\") district, with its unique artist-decorated rooms that focus more on style than useless amenities (you'll find Kiehl's toiletries but no television or telephone). Young musicians, club promoters and trendsetters hang out in the lobby's brasserie and large private garden terrace. Private parties are encouraged in the biggest room, with an extended balcony overlooking the terrace and a stocked wet bar. \u2022 8 rue Navarin, 9th, +33 1 4878 3180, hotelamourparis.fr. M\u00e9tro: Pigalle.

Rooms have air conditioning, flatscreen TVs and free Wi-Fi. Breakfast (complimentary in 2011) is served in a bright dining room off the lobby. Located right between the charming Mus\u00e9e de la Vie Romantique and the Atelier Gustave Moreau, the hotel is also convenient for Les Grands Magasins department stores on the Boulevard Haussmann and the nightlife of Montmartre. \u2022 29, rue La Bruy\u00e8re, 9th, +33 1 4874 8790, astotel.com/uk/hotel-monterosa-paris.php. M\u00e9tro: Saint-Georges. Doubles from \u20ac189 Taylor Hotel It may not seem like the prettiest neighbourhood at first sight, but this charming and spotless little hotel is right between two of the city's up-and-coming districts, the north Marais and the Canal St Martin, with easy access to the Gare de l'Est, Gare du Nord and main M\u00e9tro stations. The pastel fabrics and whitewashed wooden furnishings make for a welcoming, feminine atmosphere. Parquet flooring, fluffy bathrobes and free Wi-Fi found in each room. Book the lover's theme package in the Bubble Room (as in bubbly) for a sexy tryst \u2026 with accessories. \u2022 6 rue Taylor, 10th, +33 1 4240 1101, paris-hotel-taylor.com. M\u00e9tro: Jacques Bonsergent. Doubles from \u20ac86, four-person suites from \u20ac162 Color Design H\u00f4tel Budget doesn't have to mean bland. This hotel takes colour therapy seriously, with each floor featuring a different palette to fit your mood. Rooms are decorated with a neutral base of pale grey and white, accented by splashes of bright colour and intricate mosaic-tiled bathrooms. Air conditioning and Wi-Fi are included, with iPods on request. Located just behind the Bastille Opera house within an easy walk to the Marais and Aligre market, the hotel is also convenient for anyone heading in or out of Paris by train at the Gare de Lyon station. \u2022 35 rue des Citeaux, 12th, +33 1 4307 7728, colordesignhotel.parishotels.it. M\u00e9tro: Ledru-Rollin. Doubles from \u20ac137 L'Adresse Rooms in chocolate velour, black stone, or silver satin give this hotel a contemporary, sexy vibe. Leather, suede, and snakeskin fabrics mix with chrome, marble and dark wood. Extras include an iPhone charger, iPod docking, flatscreen TVs and Nespresso machines, with entrance to the local gym included in the room rate. And despite its address on the edge of town, you'll find it conveniently located just a block from the Palais des Congr\u00e8s and the Line 1 M\u00e9tro, two stops from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elys\u00e9es. \u2022 22 rue de D\u00e9barcad\u00e8re, 17th, +33 1 5805 0888, ladresse-hotel.com. M\u00e9tro: Porte Maillot. Doubles from \u20ac180 Mama Shelter The outlying location of this rule-breaking budget design hotel only adds to its stylish, counterculture reputation. Rooms are decorated by Philippe Starck in a funky minimalist style with iMacs, microwaves, free movies on demand and high quality bedding. All rooms have the same amenities \u2013 you pay extra for size or balcony space. The hotel's gourmet restaurant, pizzeria, cocktail bar and rooftop summer terrace attract Paris's alternative fashion and music crowd, giving Mama Shelter tons of street cred. It's also convenient for Roissy-CDG airport and the east Parisian nightlife scene. If the taxi fares are equally as frightening as public transport, rent one of the hotel's scooters or Smart Cars. \u2022 109 rue de Bagnolet, 20th, +33 1 4348 4848, mamashelter.com.
