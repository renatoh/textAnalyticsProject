Thanks for reading. Auf wiedersehen! And last but not least, from Turf Moor: The match report from Spurs v Sheffield United: And our take from St James\u2019: And here\u2019s our live coverage of England\u2019s Lionesses\u2019 big game at Wembley, where none other than Germany are the visitors. D\u00fcnnpfiff time for Phil Neville? Here\u2019s our match report from St Mary\u2019s: More important lessons in German. \u201cAs an Austrian I cannot accept those awful German synonyms for squits,\u201d writes Jan Krcmar. \u201cHasenh\u00fcttl would not say D\u00fcnnpfiff, but Scheisserei. That would be like claiming that cockneys greet each other by saying \u2018a\u2019rite lad\u2019. Hasenh\u00fcttl would not say any of the words you typed, because he is not a Piefke (German).\u201d Today\u2019s very tasty teatime game is Leicester against Arsenal, which can be followed here: AFC Wimbledon 1-1 Doncaster Rovers Accrington Stanley 0-1 Crewe Alexandra Blackpool 4-1 Morecambe Bolton Wanderers 0-1 Plymouth Argyle Cambridge United 1-1 Exeter City Carshalton Athletic 1-4 Boston United Cheltenham Town 1-1 Swindon Town Colchester United 0-2 Coventry City Crawley Town 4-1 Scunthorpe United Ebbsfleet United 2-3 Notts County Forest Green Rovers 4-0 Billericay Grimsby Town 1-1 Newport County Ipswich Town 1-1 Lincoln City Maidenhead United 1-3 Rotherham United Maidstone United 1-0 Torquay United Mansfield Town 1-0 Chorley Milton Keynes Dons 0-1 Port Vale Nantwich Town 0-1 AFC Fylde Oxford City 1-5 Solihull Moors Salford City 1-1 Burton Albion Shrewsbury Town 1-1 Bradford City Stevenage 1-1 Peterborough United Stourbridge 2-2 Eastleigh Tranmere Rovers 2-2 Wycombe Wanderers Walsall 2-2 Darlington Birmingham City 0-1 Fulham Leeds United 2-1 Blackburn Rovers Reading 3-0 Luton Town Barnsley 2-4 Stoke City Hull City 0-1 West Brom Millwall 2-1 Charlton Athletic Preston North End 3-1 Huddersfield Town Queens Park Rangers 2-2 Middlesbrough Sheffield Wednesday 2-2 Swansea City Wigan Athletic 0-3 Brentford Second v third ends in a stalemate. Stow remain unbeaten in the league. And that\u2019s full time across the country. Full updates to follow \u2026 More highbrow correspondence: \u201cIf West Ham smartarses want to use \u2018wherefore\u2019 correctly,\u201d writes Russell Richardson, \u201csurely they ought to say \u2018Roberto, Roberto, wherefore art thou Roberto\u2019, which is a good question, actually.\u201d Good point well made. More German lessons, as Oliver Bandmann skids into the conversation: \u201cCould I be very anal and insist on CAPITAL letters at the beginning of Flitzkacke, Duennpfiff, Duenschiss, please? May I also quote the Germany defender Andreas Brehme: \u2018Haste Scheisse am Fuss, haste Scheisse am Fuss\u2019 (\u2018If you have shit sticking to your foot, you have shit sticking to your foot\u2019). You may indeed. I wonder if Jorge Valdano speaks German. Two wins on the trot for Steve Bruce! Rafael who? \u0141ukasz, \u0141ukasz, wherefore art thou, \u0141ukasz? (And yes, smartarses, I know it doesn\u2019t actually mean where) Bravo, Blades. The story of the season so far. Flitzekacke! \u2026 but it comes to nowt. D\u00fcnnpfiff! Stoppage-time at St Mary\u2019s, and James Ward-Prowse stands over a deal ball \u2026 Nick Godwin adds his voice to the ever-thinning contingent of VAR advocates: \u201cFractions count \u2013 the difference between gold and silver can be a millimetre. It\u2019s a sport. Gone are the days when everyone EXCEPT the ref, knew it was offside.\u201d Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s first week on the Stoke job is going swimmingly, by the way: they\u2019re now 4-1 up at Barnsley, Sam Clucas adding to his earlier halfway-line effort with another long-rang belter. Give that man a coconut. Back to our German class. Tony Webb writes: \u201cSpelling and that - OK, it\u2019s a fair cop. To make amends I am happy to add both flitzkacke / flitzekacke and d\u00fcnnpfiff to your growing collection of German words meaning the squits.\u201d Splendid. I\u2019ve found one. A VAR proponent! \u201cI\u2019m in favour of VAR,\u201d writes Joseph Harvey. \u201cCompletely got rid of foul play and violent conduct in the World Cup, and for that alone is worth it. Remember when Alli punched someone during play? That doesn\u2019t happen anymore. VAR could be improved, but on the whole the game is better (and more just, which is important to the players) with it than without it.\u201d The Blades get a hard-earned equaliser, George Baldock\u2019s cross sneaking in. They don\u2019t get to celebrate mind, thanks to the joylessness of an interminable VAR check. But they\u2019re level. AFC Wimbledon 1-1 Doncaster Accrington Stanley 0-1 Crewe Blackpool 3-1 Morecambe Bolton Wanderers 0-1 Plymouth Argyle Cambridge United 0-1 Exeter City Carshalton Athletic 0-2 Boston United Cheltenham Town 0-0 Swindon Town Colchester United 0-2 Coventry City Crawley Town 1-0 Scunthorpe United Ebbsfleet United 1-2 Notts County Forest Green Rovers 4-0 Billericay Grimsby Town 1-0 Newport County Ipswich Town 0-1 Lincoln City Maidenhead United 1-0 Rotherham United Maidstone United 1-0 Torquay United Mansfield Town 0-0 Chorley Milton Keynes Dons 0-1 Port Vale Nantwich Town 0-1 AFC Fylde Oxford City 0-5 Solihull Moors Salford Cit 0-0 Burton Albion Shrewsbury Town 1-1 Bradford City Stevenage 1-0 Peterborough United Stourbridge 2-1 Eastleigh Tranmere Rovers 2-2 Wycombe Wanderers Walsall 0-1 Darlington Hassenh\u00fcttl geht der Arsch auf Grundeis! Richarlison makes a tricky chance look easy, volleying home his fifth goal of the season, and things suddenly look very grim for the Saints. Twenty minutes for them to find a reply. A flurry of Var-related emails following the shenanigans at White Hart Lane. I\u2019ll spare you the specifics, but safe to say everyone is on the same page. The question is: is literally anyone in favour any more? A note to Fifa: there\u2019s no shame in just calling it all a failed experiment. Birmingham City 0-1 Fulham Leeds United 2-1 Blackburn Rovers Reading 2-0 Luton Town Barnsley 1-2 Stoke City Hull City 0-1 West Brom Millwall 1-1 Charlton Athletic Preston 3-0 Huddersfield Town Queens Park Rangers 2-1 Middlesbrough Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Swansea City Wigan Athletic 0-1 Brentford That Roberto own-goal, by the way: not good. Not good at all. Sheffield United\u2019s equaliser is disallowed three minutes (and countless carefully-measured green lines) after it was scored, McGoldrick judged offside. But it\u2019s fractional to the point of nonexistent. Cue outrage. The visitors have been superb, by all accounts. A third goal in four days goal for Son, who punishes an Enda Stevens mistake, collecting a loose pass to drive past Henderson and into the net. A turnaround on Tyneside. Ciaran Clark with a messy finish but Steve Bruce won\u2019t mind. Two-one Oh dear god. Roberto, at fault for both Burnley\u2019s first two goals, has just punched a third into his own net. Perfect hattrick. Don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you. A hopeful Wales fan writes: \u201cBit of a long shot but if there are any Welsh fans in eastern Anatolia overlanding from Wales to Baku for next weeks qualifier fancy a beer in Erzurum tonight?\u201d If so, tweet @Dic_Penderyn. More correspondence from Berlin. Kristof responds: \u201cI have to correct Tony, it\u2019s spelled d\u00fcnnschiss. You could also say flotter otto (\u2018brisk otto\u2019) while we\u2019re at it.\u201d This is getting very anal. And Ralf Hassenh\u00fcttl will be gerade d\u00fcnnschei\u00df a little bit less now, Danny Ings converting Sofiane Boufal\u2019s cross to level things up. \u201cAnyone know know what the story is with Michael Keane?\u201d asks Dean Kinsella. \u201cDoesn\u2019t appear to be injured. Has he fallen that far from grace?\u201d I believe so - he\u2019s on the bench today, and has been in shoddy form this term. More German lessons, this time from Tony Webb in Berlin: \u201cThe word you are looking for is D\u00fcnnschei\u00df \u2013 literally \u2018thin s***\u2019, ie Ralf hat gerade d\u00fcnnschei\u00df = \u2018Ralf is s****ing himself at the moment\u2019\u201d Many thanks.

Half-time whistles sound up and down the country. Comprehensive updates to follow \u2026 This time Wood does double his side\u2019s lead \u2013 and another horrid West Ham error, Balbuena gifting the ball to McNeil, who lays it on a plate for his striker. Moments after Allan Saint-Maximin rattles the bar, his teammate brings the hosts level with a header upheld bar VAR.

Chris Woods meet a glorious cross with an equally glorious header to double the hosts\u2019 lead. Nope: VAR rules it out. Offside. West Brom had dropped to lowly third for a while there, with Preston and Leeds both winning. But they\u2019ve reclaimed top spot or the time being: Jake Livermore opens the scoring at Hull. Leeds lead against Blackburn, Patrick Bamford converting from the spot to notch his first goal since August. (Relative) giant-killing news, Solihull Moors lead at Oxford City, and Ebbsfleet against Notts County. Stoke are ahead at Barnsley, Sam Clucas channelling his inner David Beckham/Dejan Stankovic/Charlie Adam to score from the halfway line and get Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s tenure off to a splendid start. Sam Hutchinson has put Millwall in front against Charlton, Jayden Stockley has scored for Preston against Huddersfield, Reading lead Luton thanks to Michael Morrison and Wigan are behind to a goal from Brentford\u2019s Bryan Mbeumo. Oh, and Britt Assombalonga has just broken the deadlock for Middlesbrough at QPR. Goalless everywhere else. Darlington of the National League are ahead at Walsall. A (relative) giant-killing on the cards? \u2018We\u2019d say Hassenh\u00fcttl geht der Arsch auf Grundeis,\u201d writes Kristof K\u00fcnssler-McIlwain from Berlin, \u201cwhich means he\u2019s shaking in his boots a.k.a. squeaky bum time.\u201d Not quite a compound noun, but it\u2019ll do. Danke. Surrealist cartoonists: a lot more prescient than you\u2019d think: A Bournemouth set-piece Straight Off The Training Ground\u2122 leaves the Liverpool loanee with a simple finish. Lovely stuff. Over to you, Brucey. We mentioned West Ham\u2019s dodgy keeper Roberto before that game \u2013 or rather, Michael Allen did \u2013 and sure enough, it\u2019s taken just the 12 minutes for him to cost his side a goal. A flap from a corner leads to Ashley Barnes tapping in. Get well soon, \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski. Both keepers in action already at St James\u2019, Dubravka saving a point-blank Fraser shot, and Ramsdale stopping from Willems. Presented without comment: The Toffees are in front at St Mary\u2019s, Tom Davies sneaking in from a corner to nod home unmarked. Is there a German compound noun for a loudly squeaking manager\u2019s bum? Games are under way across the country, including at Catons Lane, where its second against third in the Essex Senior League Premier Division, Saffron Walden Town hosting the mighty Walthamstow FC, whose heroic promotion charge could take a further boost with a victory. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be updated on that one too. And here\u2019s the full report on Derby\u2019s derby defeat: Sunderland and Gillingham have drawn in the FA Cup, which means this clanger from Jon McLaughlin has cost his side a replay. Eeek. Pre-kickoff reading: a lovely interview with Peter Reid that manages to live up to its quite magnificent headline Here\u2019s our reporter\u2019s take on Chelsea\u2019s defeat of Crystal Palace: Meanwhile, JR emails from Illinois (not Dallas?) with the following philosophical riddle: \u201cIf Cenk Tosun is the answer, what\u2019s the question?\u201d Indeed. Although I increasingly suspect that that answer for Everton is less \u201cCenk Tosun\u201d and more \u201ca new manager\u201d. And if we\u2019re asking questions, then what about this one: where the hell\u2019s Moise Kean? \u201cHow can Roberto guy start another game for West Ham?\u201d asks a despairing Michael Allan via email. \u201cHe will cost them the game again today just like the last two weeks!\u201d You may very well be right, Michael, but I suspect the answer to your question is that the third-choice keeper is [checks notes] David Martin, whose career highlights involve four years at Liverpool (zero appearances) and 11 outings across two seasons at Millwall. But Roberto certainly has something of a reputation to salvage in wake of his recent displays. Buena suerte, amigo. And it\u2019s full-time at the City Ground, where bragging rights have been formally issued to Nottingham Forest. One-nil. All over at Stamford Bridge \u2013 Chelsea go second. And that\u2019s six league wins in a row, although I\u2019d ward against them getting too giddy given the vanquished opponents have been Palace, Watford, Burnley, Newcastle, Southampton and Brighton. Still, you can only beat what\u2019s put in front of you. Man City away next. Some interesting selections amid all that. Mauricio Pochettino, having hit on a winning formula against Red Star in midweek, has promptly gone and changed both his full-backs (although he\u2019s kept the midfield and frontline as was), while Cenk Tosun comes into the Everton side after his late equaliser last weekend, in place of Alex Iwobi, whose misplaced pass cost his side a goal. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d be dubious of any manager who finds a place for Theo Walcott in his side but not Iwobi. But what do I know. Another goal at Stamford Bridge, where Christian Pulisic, in from the cold and on a hot streak, puts Lampard\u2019s Lambs two up. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Barnes, Wood West Ham United: Roberto, Fredericks, Diop, Balbuena, Cresswell, Rice, Noble, Fornals, Snodgrass, Felipe Anderson, Haller Southampton: McCarthy; Bednarek, Stephens, Vestergaard, C\u00e9dric; Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Armstrong, Djenepo; Ings, Redmond Everton: Pickford; Sidib\u00e9, Mina, Holgate, Digne; Schneiderlin, Davies, Walcott, G Sigurdsson; Richarlison, Tosun Newcastle: D\u00fabravka; Yedlin, Fern\u00e1ndez, Lascelles, Clark, Willems; Hayden, Shelvey; Saint-Maximin, Joelinton, Almir\u00f3n Bournemouth: Ramsdale; Smith, S Cook, Ak\u00e9, Rico; H Wilson, L Cook, Billing, Fraser; C Wilson, King Team news ahoy. Tottenham: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Dier, Sanchez, Davies, Sissoko, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Dele, Son, Kane Sheffield United: Henderson, Baldock, Stevens, Fleck, O\u2019Connell, Basham, Lundstram, Egan, Norwood, McGoldrick, Mousset. Chelsea v Crystal Palace, of course, can be followed more closely here: Scratch that. Forest are ahead. Lewis Grabban pounces on a Jayden Bogle mistake to open the scoring. In already-kicked-off news, the East Midlands derby between Nottingham Forest and Derby County is goalless, while Chelsea have just gone ahead against Crystal Palace, Tammy Abraham slotting home with aplomb. Plenty of time to go in both games. Afternoon all and welcome to a very busy Saturday afternoon indeed. In the Premier League, four frighteningly out-of-form teams combine for two games \u2013 Southampton v Everton and Burnley v West Ham \u2013 that many fans will be watching through their fingers. Keep your eyes on St Mary\u2019s in particular, where a heavy defeat for either side could well result in a desk being cleared on Monday morning. Elsewhere there\u2019s a clash of styles at St James\u2019 Park, where Eddie Howe\u2019s entertainers take on Steve Bruce\u2019s thrill-killers \u2013 Bournemouth able to climb to fifth a win \u2013 and a quietly intriguing meeting in north London, where newly promoted minnows will very much fancy their chances at the home of last season\u2019s Champions League finalists. Funny old game. In the Championship, West Brom travel to Hull looking to maintain their position at the summit, though a failure to win could see them leapfrogged by one or all of Preston, Leeds and Swansea. And Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s first in charge of rock-bottom Stoke is against \u2026 second-bottom Barnsley. Lovely stuff. Oh, and to offset all that garish glamour, there\u2019s a full 27 [twenty-seven] FA Cup ties to boot, with Nantwich Town, AFC Fylde and Solihull Moors all in action.
