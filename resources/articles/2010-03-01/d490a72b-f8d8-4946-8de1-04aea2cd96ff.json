The return of the Basque playmaker has directly coincided with an upswing in form that has seen them win nine of their past 10 home games in all competitions and a record seven in a row in the Premier League. Supporters of Landon Donovan, who has returned to Los Angeles Galaxy after a loan spell that was more successful and which ended less painfully than David Beckham's at Milan, might also point to the American's contribution. Nevertheless, this was a harder-fought victory than most at Goodison Park this year and was triggered by the dismissal of Gretar Steinsson, who was judged to have pushed Yakubu as the Nigerian striker ran clear on goal. Arteta curled the resulting free-kick deliciously around the wall and into the corner of Jussi Jaaskelainen's net. Owen Coyle considered that contact between defender and forward had been \"minimal\", but what angered the Bolton manager was that Arteta moved the ball forward before taking the kick. \"He is a world-class player and he is allowed to move the ball four yards from where the offence took place,\" Coyle said. \"Even with his quality, I would suggest he is more dangerous the closer he gets to goal.\" The Bolton manager raised a quizzical eyebrow when it was put to him that Tim Cahill might also have been dismissed for using his hands to knock the ball out of Jaaskelainen's gloves after the Australian had already been booked. Steinsson's was the third red card Bolton had received in four games and, for a side who had not managed a league goal on Merseyside in five years, it was too much. Thereafter, Everton hit the frame of the goal twice before Leon Osman pulled the ball back past three white shirts at the near post for Steven Pienaar to finish off the match. It was perhaps a touch unkind of the Everton manager, David Moyes, to say Bolton carried little attacking threat. The first half began with Everton striker Victor Anichebe being carried off on a stretcher after he was kneed in the ribs with less than 15 minutes gone. Bolton then conjured the move of the match, begun and finished by Kevin Davies and featuring a couple of delightful touches from Lee Chung-yong and Jack Wilshire. They were not as good as Everton, but then these days not many are at Goodison Park \u2013 even in matches when they grind rather than glide to victory. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT SIMON PAUL, NSNO.co.uk If we could repeat our home form away from Goodison Park we'd be unstoppable. Bolton started well and didn't let us play our football. It was getting frustrating, and the referee, Alan Wiley, didn't help with his inconsistent decisions for both teams, although to be fair he got the sending-off right. It's great to have Arteta back \u2013 with him and Pienaar in the midfield we've got real creativity. Johnny Heitinga was my man of the match, he refused to be bullied and stood up to Kevin Davies's elbows very well. It makes you wonder what we could have achieved if we'd started the season playing like this. The fan's player ratings Howard 7; Neville 8, Jagielka 5, Distin 6, Baines 8; Heitinga 9; Arteta 9, Cahill 6 (Saha 62 7), Pienaar 7; Anichebe n/a (Bilyaletdinov 15 6) Yakubu 5 (Osman 76 7) ADAM ORR, Observer reader The sending-off was the key moment, especially as they scored straight from the free-kick and that was game over. I was at the opposite end but it seemed a fair decision, Steinsson was the last man and he pulled him down. I would've liked us to try to create more chances, especially in the second half when we sat back. Portsmouth and Wigan have done us a favour with their wins over Hull and Burnley \u2013 I can't see us getting dragged into a relegation scrap now. Owen Coyle has done a good job so far, he's given players like Knight and Muamba confidence and is a better man-manager than Megson was.
