They must have known it would give their fans palpitations \u2013 and it's not the last of the surprises either. Of course, Maiden are at their most effective when they stick to their galloping bass and duelling guitars formula (as in The Alchemist), but it's the wild deviations (the lush prog of the sublime Starblind; the genuinely affecting \"ballad\" Coming Home) that are truly compelling. However, with four songs alone clocking in at 40 minutes, The Final Frontier becomes less an exercise in experimentation than old-fashioned endurance, and the hushed-intro-bombastic-chorus dynamic begins to grate a little. A shame, because with a bit of judicious editing and a couple more excursions to the edges of their comfort zone, this could have been something special."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
