The code, based on a similar scheme in Venice where a \"decorum squad\" patrols St Mark's Square, will invite groups to partake in \"good clean fun\" while respecting the beach and other people's property. It is to be displayed in bars, hotels and sent out with bookings. Peter Callow, from Blackpool council, said he was sure the code of conduct would have a positive effect on visitor numbers. \"I am absolutely determined to clean up this town and confirm its fun and family image,\" he said. \"But from the outset let me say loud and clear that stag and hen parties are very welcome in Blackpool providing they respect others and keep their enjoyment clean. \"This code sets a tone and standard for the town. It's all about reassuring people that they can come to Blackpool and thoroughly enjoy themselves without the threat of unacceptable behaviour.\" Police in the resort will be able to direct anyone over the age of 16 to leave an area should there be trouble and they would not be able to return for 48 hours. Dave Daley, president of the National Association of Licensed House Managers and a Blackpool licensee, said while groups inside pubs had to abide by the rules, the problems started when they were outside. \"We don't want to spoil the fun or chase people away, but when you're walking the streets with children, some of these groups are getting a bit too close to the bone,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
