A supply station was being stocked with cases of water bottles, towels, hard hats and in one case some sanitary pads and a bible. Barricades had been turned into makeshift ladders, helping protesters to climb over the road divider from one side to the other. The centre of Hong Kong was a no-go zone for traffic. Taxi drivers had given up for the day and gone home. Among the protesters opposing the extradition bill that would make it easier to hand suspects over to China there was a sense of unity, purpose and urgency. \u2018We will keep fighting\u2019 Justin Lai and Carie Ching were helping to supply protesters with water and food, underneath one of the walkways at Admiralty. They said they were there \u201cto say no to the policy\u201d. They were aware debate over the extradition bill was called off on Wednesday, but said it was not enough. \u201cThey didn\u2019t cancel the discussion they just delay,\u201d said Ching. \u201cWe will keep fighting,\u201d said Lai. \u2018People feel like this is the last battle\u2019 One young woman, who did not want to be named, sat under an umbrella and on top of a mess of barricades and road barriers that separated police and protesters. \u201cI feel like the police are being really calm but you would never know what they\u2019re going to do next,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have experienced something like this before, the umbrella revolution, and we want to prepare as much as possible \u2026 to protect ourselves.\u201d Like many others, the delaying of Wednesday\u2019s debate on the extradition bill created hope but not enough to convince her to leave. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re intimidating them. We\u2019re just waiting for a miracle \u2026 a lot of people feel like this is the last battle and we have to fight it. I just wish the government would listen. The government should work for the people, not the other way around.\u201d \u2018We don\u2019t trust China\u2019 One protester, a 55-year-old lab technician who gave his name only as Chan, said: \u201cI am here for Hong Kong, for our next generation. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust China. Rules and laws can be arbitrarily applied and we can see this in Hong Kong already,\u201d he says, citing the recent disqualifications of pro-democracy politicians and jailing of the leaders of the 2014 Occupy Central movement. He said if the law was passed he would convert his savings to US dollars and seek to move abroad. \u2018We don\u2019t want to get violent\u2019 Brian Chan, 23, a university graduate, was pepper sprayed by police and treated at a makeshift first-aid station. His arms were red from an allergic reaction. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get violent and it\u2019s wrong, but if the government keeps ignoring us we can\u2019t rule out escalating our actions.\u201d He declined to elaborate. \u2018Law could easily be used for political purposes\u2019 Grace Chan, 30, who has a two-year-old child, said: \u201cI don\u2019t want my kid to grow up in a place where we have no sense of security. Although they say the law is for going after fugitives, it can be so easily used for political purpose.\u201d \u2018Why did they use tear gas?\u2019 Later, as police began to attack the protesters with rubber bullets and tear gas, Ada, 48, said she was \u201cshocked and upset\u201d. She was on a walkway above the site where police fired the shots. \u201cI had no idea they would keep firing tear gas as people were retreating already. Why did they do that?\u201d Two young men in their 20s said they were hit by tear gas and were now leaving. One said: \u201cI am not sure if I\u2019ll come back. The situation is too bad now.\u201d \u2018The law is a very wrong thing\u2019 \u201cThe government just wants to scare the young people [by shooting tear gas],\u201d said 80-year-old Wong Shan. \u201cThe government really shouldn\u2019t do this to peaceful protesters. Some police were even holding rifles. Unlike the 1967 riot, nobody is wrecking shops. They are just voicing their opinions. The law is a very wrong thing.\u201d \u201cHong Kong has become a dangerous place,\u201d said Freeman Yim, 36, a construction worker. \u201cYou can just imagine what Hong Kong will become once the law comes in. Everyone has come out, whatever sector they belong to. But the government doesn\u2019t listen. We cannot put up with this any more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
