The central relationship here is between Law and Chillingworth, an admirer of Mark Turner who shares the American's ability to generate intensity without hectoring. The album feels like a split between a coolly relaxed regular-jazz feel and a more rhythmically edgy contemporary approach. Law sounds distantly Metheny-like on the fast Kanda Jhati, unleashing fast, climbing figures and fluent double time off a staccato theme. The soft chording and diffuse melody of For Silver and the twisting sax theme of Laurvin Glaslowe spark remarkable improvisations that sideline the tunes, but the jazz-swinging Stract has Chillingworth in Lee Konitz mood, and A Bar In Nigeria is racing postbop that showcases the soloists and the A-list rhythm section alike. This would be an exciting band to hear live."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
