All that patient gestation comes through in Freestone\u2019s music now, a lean, mobile, unplugged and spontaneous agenda for just her tenor sax, occasional violin and voice, and quick-witted bass and drums from regulars Dave Manington and Tim Giles. The Canary Islands \u201csea of clouds\u201d mountain vistas \u2013 El Mar de Nubes \u2013 inspired the spaciousness, intensity, and fluid intuitions of Freestone\u2019s third album for her sax-led trio, a lineup for which the bar has been dauntingly set by legends including Sonny Rollins, Ornette Coleman, Sam Rivers and Joe Henderson. The title track foregrounds Freestone\u2019s rich, pliable tenor tone, yarn-spinner\u2019s pacing and expressive dynamics. Pieces such as the springy, staccato Hiding Jekyll and La Nochevieja mix tight hooks, free jazz and conversational call-and-response. El Camino opens as swooningly lyrical before Giles\u2019 gathering groove spurs Freestone\u2019s imaginative building of long-lined improvisations with minimal emphasis-signalling, and Los Indianos suggests a cross between a Sonny Rollins calypso and Ornette Coleman-esque freefall. If her vocal version of Shenandoah is unsteady, Freestone\u2019s two tenor sax interpretations of the song draw on her formidable tonal range, piper-like elisions, and balance of delicacy and bite. The Tori Freestone Trio\u2019s evolution forges on. Also out this month Israeli piano trio Shalosh\u2019s virtuosic Onwards and Upwards vivaciously taps the Bad Plus, Ahmad Jamal, the hooks and rock crescendos of Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson Trio and more. On Harp vs Harp, blues-leaning harmonica star Gr\u00e9goire Maret and guitar-like Colombian jazz harpist Edmar Casta\u00f1eda stir breezy, Pat Methenyesque swingers (Metheny is a Maret fan), ardent ballads, and a deep-toned slow tango for Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s vocalist wife Andrea Tierra. UK pianist Liam Noble\u2019s terrific The Long Game is a rhythmically wily, electronics-steeped adventure with Polar Bear\u2019s Tom Herbert and Seb Rochford on bass and drums. There are John Scofield-like synthed guitar sounds over solemn funk, abstract wanderings, canny Rochford-prodded rock and Latin grooves. And French vocalist Le\u0457la Martial\u2019s Warm Canto, an enthralling, experimental, playful one-off, explores her palette of western and non-western sounds, and influences from Bj\u00f6rk to Bobby McFerrin and her freethinking vocal compatriot Camille."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
