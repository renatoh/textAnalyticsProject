Pas de la Casa (200/220cm) and Soldeu (110/200cm) are in fine, flaky fettle under blue skies. Otherwise in 'Old Europe' the mild weather means slushy lower slopes. Conditions are just dandy in the 'Axis of Skivilles' resorts of California, Colorado and Utah - as the elements continued to drop their WMD (Winter of Much Distinction) from the sky. Beaver Creek (163/201cm) and Breckenridge (160/223cm), Colorado are the pick. Canadian resorts Fernie (100/254cm) and Whistler (70/200cm), British Columbia, have been refreshed and offer some good off-piste powder. But wrap up - temperatures are well below average at the moment, with Calgary enjoying minus 30C. Deal of the week Inghams (020 8780 8800) offers seven nights' skiing in Zermatt or Verbier (the resort is allocated on arrival) from \u00a3299. Price includes flights, transfers and chalet board (breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner). Departing 22 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
