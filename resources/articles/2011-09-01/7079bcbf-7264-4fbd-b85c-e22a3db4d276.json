The nearest neighbour is a quarter of a mile away. It's really quiet, with an amazing view \u2013 can't see a pylon, can't see a road. Blockbuster's an event in our house, when the little blue envelope comes in. We have 14 horses. It's a nebulous world, in television and acting, it's all made up. So to sit on a tangible horse and worry about your tangible arse falling off is a good release. I've come off, but Chester and I have an understanding. I don't ask much of him and he lets me stay on. If Men Behaving Badly came back, I think it might be a bit seedy. People in their 50s with the thinking of teenagers. It would be hard to do people's memory justice. And, you know, the others haven't aged as well as me. Men Behaving Badly taught people my name, as opposed to, \"Aren't you that bloke from The Bill?\" I've never been in The Bill. I haven't done Casualty, either. I should let them know. Doc Martin could be a guest surgeon. I'm 50 in November. It feels quite significant, quite grown-up, inescapable. The idea of being a young 50 sounds like you're trying to kid yourself, like a Harley-Davidson or something. I've bought a dressage horse instead. With my hand on my heart, it's awful to lose your father [Clunes's father died when he was eight], but in the world of difficult childhoods, it doesn't really register. I haven't been fostered, or neglected, or brought up by an addict. I just lost my dad, which was as horrid as it was. I was close to my mum. I was with her when she died three years ago, which I was grateful for. I was grateful for her that she wasn't alone. I was grateful for me because I didn't have unfinished business with her. My granny used to do Meals on Wheels and decorate the church at Easter. I think the charitable gene just needs opportunities. We have a fair on our farm every year \u2013 a gymkhana, and a dog show and a funfair and a heavy-horse show. It was my idea. Be careful what you wish for \u2013 it's a monster. I am going to Madagascar, which is an ambition. Probably the oldest one I have; possibly the only one I have. As a child, I was drawn to the notion of Madagascar. I'm finally going there to make a programme \u2013 pretty much every animal there is indigenous because it separated so long ago. Am I as grumpy as Doc Martin? If people are annoying, then I get annoyed. But I have a sunny disposition. I'll go around trying to make everyone like me, unless they don't deserve to like me. Or if they let it be known that they don't like me, well, what can I do with that? I can't work with that. If you work in the theatre, you walk on stage and you think, at least three people can't stand me in this room. Their wives drag them along, that's who the theatre's full of. You end up playing to them, just out of spite \u2013 you've got two hours of this, mate. Next time she says we're going to the theatre, just say no. Martin Clunes is a patron of Macmillan Cancer Support. The World's Biggest Coffee Morning is on 30 September (macmillan.org.uk/coffee; 0845 070 1315). Doc Martin is on ITV1 on Mondays"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
