The team were 4-1 down and defending so ineptly that the end for the manager seemed inevitable. By the finish Roeder's job appeared safe again - at least until after Manchester United visit on Sunday. Booed off at the interval, West Ham were applauded at the end. They did not overturn that three-goal deficit - though they made enough chances - and are in serious trouble, sitting in the bottom three and still without a home win. Yet the spirit of their second-half display, aided by panicky Leeds defending that borrowed from West Ham's earlier efforts, has surely earned Roeder a reprieve. While Terry Venables must be grateful to West Ham's initial ineptitude and some enterprising Leeds attacking in the first half for easing the pressure on him, Roeder should thank Paolo di Canio more than anyone. The Italian does not know whether he has a future at Upton Park but that hardly prevents him giving everything to the cause. The striker ended with two goals, frequently bamboozled Leeds and set the example by refusing to give in. None of the West Ham side performed in a second 45 minutes they dominated as if they want to see Roeder dismissed and the manager insisted he does not fear the sack. He knows, though, that his team must tighten up. \"If our defending - or non-defending - is like it was in the first half we are going to be in serious trouble again,\" he said. \"I'm very angry. We just gifted Leeds four goals and it's very difficult to legislate for such poor defending. But [my players] didn't collapse. They could have, and maybe some teams would have, but I think they showed how much they care.\" The change of mood in the stands from angry to appreciative has at least temporarily saved Roeder, who has no intention of quitting, but serious questions still need to be asked. Not least of the defending that enabled Leeds to score four first-half goals and might have seen them get four more. Rarely, if ever, can a Premiership team have defended so poorly. Roeder described the defending as \"diabolical\" and \"woeful\". Christian Dailly was at fault for two goals, one with a dreadful backpass. Tomas Repka was so hapless, and in danger of being sent off after receiving a booking for his part in a running battle with Mark Viduka, that he was taken off at half-time. West Ham struggled to cope with Harry Kewell flitting around behind the awkward Viduka and were frequently stretched in wide areas. The home team's vulnerability on balls whipped into the box was embarrassing. By half-time Kewell had scored twice and Viduka once after Nick Barmby's opener. Roeder must take some of the blame for poor organisation and questionable selection. West Ham's marking was shambolic at set pieces, which led directly to one goal and contributed to another. They looked more solid after the interval with S\u00e9bastien Schemmel at right-back and Dailly shifted into the centre. Moreover, Roeder's decision to start with Joe Cole and Michael Carrick in central midfield proved unwise. They were outmuscled and West Ham were helped by a 50th-minute injury to Steve Lomas, which enabled Edouard Ciss\u00e9 to bring greater strength to the middle and pushed Cole into a wide right role where he was more effective. Much improved as West Ham were in the second half, their display needs to be seen in the context of a team who had nothing to lose. They remain unable to start games at Upton Park with the gusto they show once behind. It was the same story at home to Everton, who held on to win 1-0 last month. Then, as here, they hit too many long balls to begin with. Venables was smiling afterwards but his team creaked under pressure and looked unlikely to attain the European place Leeds desperately want for financial reasons. Yet Viduka and Kewell, criticised of late, showed in the first half that they can be a handful. Kewell set up Barmby's opener after Dailly had failed to head clear, headed in Ian Harte's corner to restore Leeds's lead after Di Canio had equalised, and volleyed a third from Harte's cross. The fourth arrived when Dailly's backpass left David James in trouble and the keeper's clearance cannoned off Viduka to leave the striker with an open net. Inspired by Di Canio, West Ham fought back and Leeds barely had a chance after the interval. The Italian won a penalty for a tackle by Gary Kelly which he converted and West Ham gained real hope when Trevor Sinclair headed in a Schemmel corner. But the chances they made after that were not taken. Roeder remains on shaky ground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
