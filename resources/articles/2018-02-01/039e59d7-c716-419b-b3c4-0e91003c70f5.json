The White House has claimed ignorance of allegations of spousal abuse against Porter, who was promoted to become a close aide to the president, until the moment photos of one of his ex-wives, Colbie Holderness, were published last week showing her with a badly bruised eye. But Wray testified before Congress that the FBI had submitted a completed background investigation on Porter to the White House in July 2017 and later supplied two follow-up reports. \u201cWe administratively closed the file in January\u201d of 2018, Wray said, setting a date months before the White House officials said they knew about the allegations. In the face of heated questioning Tuesday, press secretary Sarah Sanders denied there was a contradiction between the White House story and the FBI story. Sanders acknowledged that the White House had received a report from the FBI on a completed background investigation into Porter, but she claimed that at the time of Porter\u2019s resignation that report was stuck in the White House personnel office. \u201cThe White House personnel security office, staffed by career officials,\u201d Sanders said, \u201chad not made a final recommendation for adjudication to the White House.\u201d She drew a distinction between that office and the work done by agents, saying: \u201cThe FBI portion was closed.\u201d \u201cThe White House personnel security office,\u201d she continued, \u201chad not finished their investigation.\u201d Challenged on whether White House chief of staff John Kelly really had no inkling of the allegations against Porter, Sanders said \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding\u201d. After the first report last week, Kelly initially defended Porter\u2019s character as \u201ca man of true integrity and honor\u201d. He later claimed to be \u201cshocked\u201d by further revelations, but his contradictory and shifting explanations raised questions about what he and other White House officials knew of Porter\u2019s background. The changing White House statements also raised questions about Kelly\u2019s future and another shake-up in the president\u2019s inner circle, which has had historic turnover. Over the weekend, one senior aide to the president, Kellyanne Conway, insisted Trump continues to have confidence in Kelly. The White House deputy press secretary, Raj Shah, last week blamed what he said was an incomplete FBI inquiry for the failure to identify the alleged abuser. \u201cIn the case of Rob Porter, we relied on the background check investigative process,\u201d Shah said on 8 February, in his first-ever turn at the Brady briefing room lectern. \u201cThat process hadn\u2019t been completed, so we were relying on the information that we had.\u201d Wray contradicted that account Tuesday. On Saturday, the president sent a tweet that some read as a defense of Porter. \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cSome are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused \u2013 life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d At least 20 such women have accused Trump personally of sexual misconduct. He has said they are lying. Wray was also asked about the president\u2019s assertion on Twitter that the reputation of the FBI is in tatters. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of opinions about our agency,\u201d Wray said. He encouraged \u201cfolks not to get to hung up\u201d on what he called social media \u201cnoise\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
