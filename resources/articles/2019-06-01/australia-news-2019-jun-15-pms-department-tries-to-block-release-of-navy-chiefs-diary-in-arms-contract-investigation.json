The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick is attempting to uncover the circumstances that led the government to hand a $4bn patrol boat contract to the German shipbuilder Luerssen, instead of Austal, a local company, which said it could do the work for less. The defence department had resisted Patrick\u2019s attempts to secure the diaries of the navy chief and defence\u2019s head of capability acquisition and sustainment. Last month, the department was found to have misused exemptions to freedom of information law when rejecting Patrick\u2019s request for the diaries. The information commissioner ordered it to release the documents, and the department confirmed to Guardian Australia that it planned to do so. But this week, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet intervened to keep the diaries secret. It will take the case to the administrative appeals tribunal on behalf of the government. Patrick believes the government is trying to prevent him from setting a precedent that would provide greater transparency around the diaries of senior government officials. The defence department had previously tried to use exemptions that prevented material from being released if it revealed the deliberations of the cabinet. The information commissioner, Angelene Falk, had found that the diaries contained only dates of cabinet meetings, which could not be taken to reveal the content of cabinet discussions. \u201cThe information merely records the appointments that have been scheduled for a particular day and do not contain any further information as to what was considered or discussed in those meetings,\u201d Falk found. Patrick said the government wanted to avoid letting that precedent stand. \u201cThey\u2019re not worried about the chief of navy\u2019s appointments,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worry is about that precedent, and the claim they\u2019ve made is about cabinet dates.\u201d The PM\u2019s department said it was seeking a review of the decision as an \u201caffected third party\u201d. A spokesman said the diaries contained \u201ccabinet-in-confidence material\u201d. \u201cAccordingly, the department, as the custodian of cabinet information and processes, is an affected third party and has exercised this right of review,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cAs the matter is currently with the AAT, it is not appropriate to comment further.\u201d Patrick said the government could be spending thousands simply to keep dates secret. \u201cWhat\u2019s the cost of a date?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn another AAT FOI matter I\u2019m involved in, they\u2019ve spent more than $150,000 on legal fees. It is going to cost a significant amount of money to try to protect a date in circumstances where I already know the week, and have a pretty good idea of the day.\u201d The most recent data available on FOI law in Australia shows a worrying trend against transparency. FOI refusals are at their highest level since records began in 2010-11, spiking recently because of high rates at the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility. The total fees and charges imposed by Australian government agencies has declined significantly since peaking in 2010-11, but the costs of FOI can still be prohibitive, particularly for individuals or smaller non-profit organisations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
