For the national team, it marked the end of a six-and-a-half year absence in which, after countless delays, a new \u00a3800m stadium was constructed. For old Goldenballs, as Beckham is known to his wife, it was the end of an 11-month exile which began when he resigned the captaincy of the team and then discovered, to his surprise and disappointment, that he was being left out of the team altogether. Beckham tends to write his own scripts, and no Hollywood screenwriter could have bettered the moment, just over an hour into last night's friendly match against Brazil, when his free kick was headed home by John Terry, his successor as captain, to give England a 1-0 lead. In front of an excited crowd of almost 90,000, including Victoria Beckham and two of the couple's sons, the presence of the former hero ensured that there would be no instant replay of the boiling rage with which England's own supporters greeted an unconvincing win over Andorra two months ago. His return from Spain at the age of 32 seemed to be enough to lift the spirits on a gala night when Brazil, the five-times world champions, provided suitable opposition. Even Steve McClaren, the much reviled head coach, was accorded a polite reception. Wisely, Beckham had kept his own counsel during the six days between the announcement of McClaren's decision to recall him to the squad and last night's match. Probably calculating that there would be quite enough coverage anyway, he did not make himself available to the media. That coverage ranged from heated arguments over his continuing value as a footballer to the rumour that he is to receive a knighthood in Tony Blair's resignation honours list. The latter suggestion, a move which would transform his wife, a former Spice Girl, into Lady Beckham, raised the predictable howls of outrage from those who remember that no such honour was bestowed on the late Bobby Moore, the exemplary captain of England's 1966 World Cup winners. Moore's statue stands outside the new Wembley, a belated recompense to his memory and, in some eyes, a permanent reproach to the players of the present generation, who have so often failed to live up to the feverish expectations of their supporters. Beckham's return coincided with England's desperate need for maximum points from a series of matches in which their qualification for the finals of the Euro 2008 championship will be decided. Under his captaincy, and the management of Sven-Goran Eriksson, the squad were eliminated at the quarter-final stages of two World Cups and one European championship. With Terry now wearing the captain's armband, last night Beckham was back in the team strictly on his footballing merits, only a few weeks before he and his family fly to California, where he will earn a projected \u00a3128m from a four-year contract with Los Angeles Galaxy. And so Beckham, whose captaincy began after the abandonment of the old Wembley, pulled on an England shirt for the 95th time, renewing his dreams of reaching his century in what will surely be a coda to his long and often controversial career. While he remained a discreet presence for most of an even-tempered match, he proved that he still has the ability to provide a foundation for a team that remains, unlike the new stadium, a work in progress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
