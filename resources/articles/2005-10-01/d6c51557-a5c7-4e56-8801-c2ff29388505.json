Bertha McDougall, a former primary school teacher, set up the victims' lobby group Forgotten Families after her husband Lindsay McDougall, an RUC reservist, was shot dead in Belfast city centre in 1981. She will head a forum for victims of the Troubles, looking at services, grants and funding. While unionists welcomed the appointment, Sinn Fein said Mrs McDougall must show she can empathise with all victims, including victims of \"state killings\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
