Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who was murdered and dismembered by a hit squad in his country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul last year, was one of the latter. I met him just once, about 15 years ago, when I was foreign editor of the Observer and he was a spokesman for the Saudi embassy in London. A big bear of a man, Khashoggi was still in favour then with those in power in Riyadh, despite having been fired from several media posts as he trod a fine line between loyalist and critic. As Jonathan Rugman documents in his powerful account of the Washington Post columnist\u2019s grisly killing, Khashoggi was aware of the boundaries he was testing. But with the ascent of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (blamed by many for the murder) as the country\u2019s vindictive new power behind the throne, all the rules changed. Khashoggi was butchered, in Rugman\u2019s telling, not because he posed a particular threat, but because he wouldn\u2019t kiss the ring. \u201cPerhaps the best way of explaining [Khashoggi\u2019s] murder,\u201d he writes, \u201cis to put it down to the paranoia of one man [Bin Salman], who could not tolerate direct criticism from a fellow Saudi he regarded as a traitor residing far too close to the heart of American power.\u201d The Killing in the Consulate is a chilling book, not least in its account of those in the Saudi regime blandly plotting Kashoggi\u2019s assassination. The story may be familiar, but Rugman, foreign correspondent at Channel 4 News, supplies telling new detail and context, transforming it into a dark fable of unaccountable power. Skilfully weaving together the story of Khashoggi\u2019s mounting disillusionment with Saudi Arabia under the new crown prince, it is also an indictment of the sordid realpolitik of the response to his murder, led by the cowardly President Trump. Khashoggi emerges as a complicated figure, both in his professional and personal life. Attracted to the Muslim Brotherhood as a young man, he later became well known in the Arab media for his early interviews with Osama bin Laden. His friends and contacts included princes, intellectuals, businessmen and Islamists, leading some to distrust him as a court insider or even a spy, a suggestion he denied. Simply, when confronted with Bin Salman\u2019s campaign of repression, Khashoggi wanted the freedom to criticise as well as encourage. Despite initially being feted as a bold young reformer \u2013 for allowing women to drive and opening up cinemas \u2013 the new crown prince\u2019s vision was about \u201cprivileges, not rights\u201d. No one could be seen to eclipse him. Rival royals were rounded up, imprisoned and stripped of billions of dollars. Women\u2019s rights activists, who had campaigned for an end to the ban on driving, were arrested on the eve of the prohibition being lifted, tortured and put on trial. Other critics arrested included Khashoggi\u2019s friend the economist Essam al-Zamil, a key turning point for the journalist. As became clear after Khashoggi\u2019s murder, a coterie of thugs around Bin Salman, notably his \u201cmedia adviser\u201d Saud al-Qahtani, played prominent roles in each of the outrages. And Khashoggi, exiled in the US, was also in his sights. An isolated and lonely figure, who had been systematically cut off from friends and family and sources of income, he was an easy target for those plotting to harm him. And when Khashoggi visited the consulate to pick up the divorce papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancee, he disappeared inside, never to reappear. When called upon to explain, the Saudis repeatedly changed their story, first suggesting he had left the building by a back door; then, that he had been killed during an argument. Finally, it was acknowledged that he had been murdered by officials who had exceeded their authority. Perhaps most shocking is the sense of impunity in Riyadh. \u201cTime heals,\u201d a senior Saudi royal told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cAnd when the verdict is out, when justice is done, when a few heads get chopped off, [foreign investment] will come back.\u201d \u2022 The Killing in the Consulate by Jonathan Rugman is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a320).
