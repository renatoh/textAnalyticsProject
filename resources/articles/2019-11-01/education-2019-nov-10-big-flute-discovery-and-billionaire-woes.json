Mike Hoskin Hinton St George, Somerset \u2022 My son\u2019s bassoon fell out of the open back door of a minibus transporting members of the National Youth Choir across Westminster Bridge many years ago (Letters, 6 November). It was recovered by a kind person, who reported finding \u201ca big flute\u201d in the road.

Adrian Greeman Tooting, London \u2022 Sad to see turtle doves heading for extinction (Report, 8 November). I haven\u2019t seen many milkmaids or leaping lords recently so I\u2019m worried about my Christmas list.
