I think it's a load of crap, mostly. The most sensitive and coveted workplaces in the world -- the White House, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, top-secret nuclear facilities, highly disciplined terrorist cells -- all surely feature more or less the same admixture of doers and coasters, innovators and time-card punchers, as every workplace. That's life. I will admit, however, that I'm shooting in the dark here a little. Matt Yglesias puts it this way: If you think of a talented and ambitious businessman, after all, you have to remember that you're talking about a guy who, unlike normal people, mainly focuses his life on earning as much money as possible. That's a weird state of mind in many ways. But it's a good thing there are some folks like that around, because one good way to earn a ton of money is to invent a product that lots of people find useful when sold at a profitable price. None of my best friends are talented and ambitious businesspeople, but most of my favorite stuff is made by firms managed by such people. It occurs to me that I don't actually know anyone whose main goal in life is to make money. I mean, I guess I've met a few, but they're Martians to me. I only actually know people who do work that they find intellectually interesting or rewarding in some other way. This is not to say that people whose main goal is to make money aren't also interested or rewarded by their work. And I'm sure that's true of most Wall Streeters. But I reckon that, back in college, when they declared their major and started thinking about a career, it wasn't so much that arbitrage, say, fascinated them on an intellectual level. I think they mostly just wanted to be well-off and figured a business degree would make them such. I know not a single person like that. I know some guys from back in West Virginia who went into business, but they didn't do it get rich. They did it to become middle-class, or upper-middle-class, and provide for their families but still have time to drink beer with the fellas and play golf. That's different. American society is deeply segregated, it occurs to me, along the lines of those who want to be rich and those who want other things instead. Our paths almost never cross by intention. I want to keep it that way, and I'm sure they do, too. Hence the caveat, which is, I may have no idea how these people think. I think wanting that badly to be rich is really a messed up way to approach the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
