So minimal is it, in fact, that you're liable to check the disc's still spinning at times. The busiest early occurrences are mainly free-improv, and conventional jazzers will find little with which they're familiar until halfway through this 70-minute set. Still, Parish's 13 tracks do have a developing shape, the detail in Stronen's meticulous percussion is constantly arresting, and the mingling of short motifs with open playing is very subtly done. In the early improv sections Ljungkvist's clarinet brings a continuity to the lurching restlessness of the conversations. Daddycation, especially, is captivating, all long reed outbreaths moistened with melody. For his part, Stenson sounds as if he's exploring Concerto D'Aranjuez on Quartz, where the pianist's melodic fluency is complemented by a rocking two-chord vamp. In Motion, meanwhile, is a fragile tapestry of percussion sound building over hustling drums, and the closing Nu has an exuberant, almost South African feel. Ultimately, Parish is a marginal exercise, but Food supporters, improv fans and Stenson acolytes will find much to admire herein."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
