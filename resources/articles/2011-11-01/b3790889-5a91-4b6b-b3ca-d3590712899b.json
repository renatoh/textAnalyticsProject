As unions prepare for a national strike on 30 November involving up to 3 million public-sector workers, ministers are preparing to give ground in the highly contentious area of transferring pensions from the public to the private sector. But Whitehall sources have made it clear that any concessions will be conditional on unions signing up to the central plank of the government's changes. This is that workers' contributions will have to increase and pensions will be based on career average earnings, not final salaries. Ministers will impose a deal at the end of the year if \"hardliners\", mainly in the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), force other union leaders to reject an agreement. If ministers impose a deal, they could withdraw two concessions offered earlier this month. These were a more generous accrual rate \u2013 the percentage of salary earned as a pension every year \u2013 and a seven-year delay in the full introduction of the changes. One Whitehall source said: \"We are in the right place. Ministers are confident that most of the trade union leaders are keen to reach a deal. But they are being dragged down by hardliners such as the Public and Commercial Services Union. The old saying 'that the convoy moves at the pace of the slowest vehicle' applies here.\" The source added: \"We have to have a deal by the end of the year. If we don't have a deal by then, we will impose one. Ministers are minded to go back to the initial offer, and withdraw what was offered this month, if there is no deal. But there has been no final decision.\" Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, has told the FT that as part of an agreement with the unions, they would be allowed a token 15-minute strike on 30 November with the government not docking strikers' pay. We are willing to accomodate some kind of token action, he said. Whitehall sources say there is no more money on the table. But ministers are prepared to give ground on the \"Fair Deal\" \u2013 the system for protecting the pension rights of public-sector workers whose jobs are transferred compulsorily to the private sector. One senior Whitehall source said: \"We have some flexibility. There will be no more money. But we can look at extending things like the Fair Deal.\" Lord Hutton of Furness, the former Labour work and pensions secretary who drew up the blueprint for pension reforms on behalf of the coalition, warned in June that ministers were in danger of going too far in this area. Union leaders fear that ministers are planning to use a Treasury consulation on the Fair Deal to allow private companies to drop public sector pensions when they take over a service. \"We have to avoid a new race to the bottom here,\" Hutton said. In his interim report, published in October last year, Hutton indicated that the Fair Deal should be kept in some form. \"Ultimately, it is for the government to consider carefully the best way of moving forward with Fair Deal in a way that delivers its wider objective of encouraging a broader range of public service providers while remaining consistent with good employment practices,\" his report said. The Fair Deal was introduced in 1999 to encourage workers to co-operate with the greater involvement of the private sector in public services. It says that pension provision must be \"broadly comparable\" if staff are transferred compulsorily from the public to the private sector. The government was minded, when the Treasury consultation on the Fair Deal ended in June, to loosen the rules, which ministers fear act as a barrier to companies and charities bidding for contracts in the public sector. Whitehall sources say a decision will be made when the final shape of the negotiations becomes clear. \"You can't make a decision until you know where you have ended up on pensions,\" one source said. \"What we decide on the Fair Deal is conditional on an agreement.\" The government and most union leaders are said to be on reasonable terms after Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, made what was dubbed the final offer on 2 November. Ministers are irritated with the strike but do not regard it as a deal breaker. One Whitehall source said: \"The strikes would be wrong. But they will not break the deal. The deadline is the end of the year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
