APT has asked the federal court to rule that the part of a determination made on 27 March by health minister Greg Hunt that ordered foreign-registered cruise ships to leave Australian waters \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable\u201d is invalid. The company is trying to stop the government forcing its ship, the Caledonian Sky \u2013 a relatively small Bahamas-flagged cruise ship that is currently in Darwin\u2019s harbour \u2013 from Australian waters. However, at a brief hearing held by videolink on Tuesday morning, judge Angus Stewart said that an order of the type sought by APT \u201cpotentially affects all foreign cruise vessels in Australian territory and not only the particular vessel otherwise directly affected by this case\u201d. He asked APT to notify the attorney general of the lawsuit and said it would be heard at noon on Wednesday, possibly by the full bench of the court. Border Force commissioner Michael Outram has given an undertaking to the court not to remove the Caledonian Sky or its crew from Australia until 5pm on Thursday. Speaking in Canberra, Outram said Border Force was \u201cworking through\u201d the APT case. \u201cBut let me make clear the government\u2019s policy intent here is that all cruise ships that are in Australian waters that are not flagged or registered in Australia are to depart Australian waters and we\u2019re working to achieve that outcome,\u201d he said. Asked whether the case could have wider implications, he said that \u201cevery ship\u2019s individual\u201d. \u201cBut what I would I say is this: all of the ships we\u2019re focused [on] here are either registered in or flagged in another country\u201d. APT has been contacted for comment. While the Caledonian Sky has capacity for just 114 passengers, several much larger cruise ships that can each accommodate thousands of people remain in Australian waters, including the virus-riddled Ruby Princess. Cruise ships are generally registered in tax havens including Panama, Malta and the Bahamas, rather than high-tax jurisdictions such as Australia \u2013 a decision that has now come back to bite the industry. Outram said he had considered applications by cruise operators who wanted to keep their ships in Australian waters and rejected them all. He said that when Hunt made his determination there were 20 cruise ships in Australian waters. \u201cThirteen of those 20 have left, or are in the process of leaving today, Australian ports and seas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by Thursday we expect a further four to have departed.\u201d He said this removed about 13,500 workers from Australian waters who, if they had become sick, would have been \u201ca big strain on the Australian health system\u201d. Luxury liner the Queen Elizabeth was expected to leave Brisbane on Tuesday for an unknown destination even though it has no cases of coronavirus and has been sitting off Gladstone for more than two weeks. The only Australian member of the crew, Gordon Dedman, who plays the trumpet in the ships\u2019 Royal Court Theatre orchestra said he had been told to prepare to disembark, as the ship\u2019s owners Cunard did not know where the ship would go and it was uncertain whether he could be easily returned to Australia. There are more than 900 crew on board including from the Philippines, India, the UK, US and Canada. \u201cI would rather stay,\u201d Dedman said. \u201cI know this is a safe environment, because no one on board has coronavirus and we\u2019ve been in isolation for more than two weeks.\u201d \u201cIt seems we are all being tarred with one brush. Australia\u2019s name will be rubbish in the cruise at the end of this crisis,\u201d he said. He said Cunard, part of the Carnival group, has been \u201cfantastic\u201d to the crew. The Queen Elizabeth arrived in Sydney on 15 March after a short cruise to Tasmania and Melbourne. Before that it had been to Papua New Guinea. That same day, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a ban on cruise ships. Dedman said the crew were permitted off the ship by health authorities and boarded again at 2am before travelling to Gladstone, where the ship has been moored since. On 19 March the Ruby Princess returned from New Zealand, with several sick passengers on board. There is now a criminal investigation into how the ship was allowed to disembark more than 2,700 passengers in Sydney before test results for three passengers came back. The incident has led to more than 600 cases of Covid-19 in Australia and several deaths. The Queen Elizabeth, along with all other cruise liners, has now been ordered out of Australian waters and is in Brisbane refuelling and taking on supplies before departing for an unknown destination. The ship is flagged out of Bermuda but has Southhampton in the UK as its home port. Dedman said he faces 14 days isolation in Brisbane, and possibly further isolation when he crosses back into NSW to return home. When he is not playing in cruise ship bands he runs bushcraft survival courses for the Army Reserve in northern Australia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
