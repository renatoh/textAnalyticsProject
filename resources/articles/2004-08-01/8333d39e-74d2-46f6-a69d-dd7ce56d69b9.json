On The Archive Hour (Saturday, Radio 4), we heard that the listener- sponsored station, set up in California in 1949, has an impressive track record of \"going where the silence is\". In 1958, a discussion on homosexuality broke broadcasting taboos; an hour-long slot was given over to an interview with Che Guevara; and throughout the 1950s blacklisted artists were promoted. Every contentious issue was tackled, and producers deliberately brought together commentators from very different political persuasions. In 1954, rather marvellously in theory, the studio was given over to four marijuana smokers who were asked to \"record themselves talking about the pleasures\" of smoking dope. \"Clearly stoned\" when they arrived, they talked and talked about it, and talked some more. A brave move, but not the most gripping radio. Kate Adie sounded wild and free as she spoke of her Private Passions (Sunday, Radio 3). Always the epitome of poise in her news reports for television and radio, she was rather more unpredictable as a guest. Her comments involved surprisingly intense peals of laughter, a weird smoochy affectation to her voice, and then quite alarming clippiness. On Shostakovich, she wondered \"whenever it slides into that jazz tone, he's going 'hehehehehehehehe', cocking a snook\". Nobody could make the concept of snook-cocking sound more icily terrifying. There was some revelation behind all the verbal oddity. I liked Adie recalling how as a student she would reach for the baroque, musically, during boyfriend troubles. \"So you sat in your room with the gas fire,\" she said, \"reading bits of ancient Norse poetry ... and still thinking, 'Shall I go round?' And you put on the baroque, and that was it.\" On Book Club (Sunday, Radio 4), Dame Muriel Spark was also addictively posh, and regularly wicked, in a discussion of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. The audience asked the usual questions, and some unusual ones. \"Do you really think Miss Brodie may have been an unconscious lesbian,\" a man asked, sounding as if the thought had long troubled him. Spark saw her chance to sparkle. \"I don't quite know what an unconscious lesbian is,\" she purred, to the crowd's delight. Spark, who moved away from Edinburgh in the 1930s, sounded as if she had never left. \"I feel very much an Edinburgh person,\" she said, \"it's a state of mind.\" In case this was all too warm and kindly, Spark also shared her thoughts, when asked, on the character of Sandy Stranger. \"I think a nasty little bitch,\" she said, with feeling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
