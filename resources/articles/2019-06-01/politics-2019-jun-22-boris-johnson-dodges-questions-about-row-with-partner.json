The former foreign secretary, whose campaign has been rocked by the Guardian\u2019s revelation that police were called to his partner\u2019s flat in the early hours of Friday morning, was asked about the incident at least half a dozen times but declined to address it. Pressed by the broadcaster Iain Dale, who accused him of \u201ccompletely avoiding my question\u201d during the hustings in Birmingham, Johnson said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they want to hear about that kind of thing, unless I am wrong. I think what they want to hear is what my plans are for the country and our party.\u201d Dale, who has himself stood as a Conservative parliamentary candidate, said: \u201cIf the police are called to your home, it makes it everyone\u2019s business. You are running for the office of not just leader of the Conservative party but prime minister. Therefore a lot of people who do admire your politics do call into question your character and I do think it is incumbent on you to answer that question.\u201d The Tory MP conceded people were entitled to ask about his character, but then went on a tangent and failed to address the incident. Asked whether a person\u2019s private life had any bearing on a person\u2019s ability to be prime minister, Johnson said: \u201cMost people would really rather judge my ambitions and my character and my programme by what I deliver in office.\u201d When Dale tried to again question Johnson, who is still the frontrunner to be the next prime minister, the crowd began jeering but the Tory MP raised his arms telling the audience \u201cdon\u2019t boo the great man\u201d. Asked again whether a person\u2019s private life had any bearing on their ability to be prime minister, as members of the audience shouted \u201cno\u201d, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve tried to give my answer pretty exhaustively. I think what people want to know is whether I have the determination and the courage to deliver on the commitments that I\u2019m making and it will need a lot of grit right now and I think people are entitled to think about this.\u201d Asked a final time whether he was going to comment on the incident, Johnson \u2013 a former journalist \u2013 said: \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty obvious from the foregoing, Iain. But I\u2019ve sat where you sat, I understand the responsibilities that you have.\u201d Dale said: \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t have spent the first five minutes on it had you answered the first question.\u201d Before being questioned, the politician\u2019s campaign video was played and he made a short speech during which he made no mention of the police call-out, instead referencing the Tory party\u2019s poor showing in polls, telling the audience: \u201cThe hour is darkest before the dawn.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s disclosure of the row between Johnson and Symonds increased scrutiny on the politician\u2019s bid to enter No 10 as the country\u2019s next prime minister. A neighbour said they had heard a woman screaming followed by slamming and banging. On a recording made by the neighbour, heard by the Guardian, Symonds can be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. The couple can be heard rowing about spilt red wine, with Symonds telling him: \u201cYou just don\u2019t care for anything because you\u2019re spoilt. You have no care for money or anything.\u201d At one stage, Johnson can be heard telling Symonds to \u201cget off my fucking laptop\u201d before there is a loud crashing noise. The neighbour said that after becoming concerned they knocked on the door but received no response, before eventually calling 999. In response to the Guardian\u2019s revelations about the row, Tory MP Mark Garnier \u2013 who is part of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s campaign team \u2013 said Johnson had \u201cfucked up\u201d at the outset of the leadership contest. Garnier, a former minister for international trade, said before the hustings on Saturday: \u201cOn the one hand you think, this is bollocks, people have arguments. My wife and I have ding dongs every now and then like all couples \u2013 although the line \u2018get off my fucking laptop\u2019 does make you wonder if she was checking his browsing history \u2013 I\u2019m just putting that out there. \u201cThe other side of this is that he has fucked up on the very first evening. My good-natured instinct is that we would not want to capitalise on this, of course not. But you have to say this is the type of attention that Boris attracts. He has the capacity to be front-page news for this kind of thing. \u201cObviously I know Boris well, and I would be perfectly happy with him being prime minister, I just think Jeremy would be better. I don\u2019t want to get into an argy-bargy about his character, we want to win this on policy.\u201d Asked if Johnson\u2019s victory in the leadership no longer seemed a foregone conclusion, Garnier replied: \u201cI believe this may be like a general election, where no one expects the Tories to win then everyone turns out to be a shy Tory. I expect that there are many more \u2018shy Hunts\u2019 than you imagine. I\u2019m optimistic. \u201cIf I do have a direct criticism on Boris he has to come out and do some debates. Hiding away is to his advantage. By the time he appears people will have sent their postal votes in. He thinks he can get away without scrutiny and then when he gets in they might think: \u2018My God!\u2019 I think that where the campaign is peculiar is that the postal votes are going out soon. I think we need to see the full Boris and the full Jeremy in glorious technicolor.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
