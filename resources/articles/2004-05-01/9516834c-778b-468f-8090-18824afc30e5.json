Arsenal parading the championship trophy through north London has meant only one thing in the Giggs household. \"There's no telly been on and no papers,\" he says. \"No way. I mean, you just don't want to see that sort of thing.\" Giggs may not have the febrile temper or the impenetrable stare of Sir Alex Ferguson or Roy Keane but that is not to say he does not share their passion for Manchester United. To him, the idea of watching an open-top bus parade through the streets of Islington is up there with having your teeth pulled without anaesthetic. Some say he has gone stale at Old Trafford, that with enough medals to fill a furniture van he no longer smoulders with the same sort of determination, but those people do not know the real Giggs. Keane says there is nobody at Old Trafford, not even himself, who trains with more dedication and, despite what may have been read elsewhere, Ferguson simply would not contemplate selling a player who, at his exhilarating best, deserves to be ranked among the world's most penetrative attackers. Neither would Giggs consider leaving, something he was willing to make perfectly clear before tomorrow's FA Cup final. Earlier in his career he expressed a vague desire to play in Italy - something that has been thrown back at him ever since - but severing his ties with England's biggest club is not an option. He is 30 now, the club's longest-serving player, and his dedication shines through as he pores over a turbulent season at Old Trafford. \"I suppose it will hurt most when you've got away in the summer. You're sitting on the beach, analysing what went wrong, turning it over in your mind,\" he says. \"It's hard to see someone else with that trophy, do you understand? That's why I couldn't bear to watch any of their title celebrations. Fair play to them, to go through a season undefeated is an unbelievable feat but I still believe we're a better side than them. They've not beaten us for a long time and we seem to be going through one of those stages that, whenever we face them, we get one up on them. It just comes down to consistency and theirs has been greater than ours.\" Returning the Cup to Old Trafford would go some way to consoling Giggs, who has also had to contend with Wales missing out on Euro 2004, but he is also acutely aware that, if they were to lose to Millwall, his self-imposed media blackout would have to last for weeks rather than days. \"I don't even want to think about it happening. It's been a disappointing season and, if you don't win anything at Manchester United, people want to know why. When you don't win the championship there are always questions asked - tough questions - so it's vital we don't slip up here. \"Personally I can't wait. It's in Cardiff, which makes it more special for me, and if I'm being honest I never liked playing at Wembley anyway. The atmosphere was great, walking out of the tunnel and all that stuff, but the pitch was so sticky you couldn't dribble with the ball.\" The bad news for Millwall is that the Millennium Stadium ranks among Giggs' favourite venues and he is determined to end the season with a flourish. \"I played a lot better at the start of the season than the way I finished. I was happy with my form until Christmas but since then it's been really patchy. I've been here a long time and the gaffer probably bollocks me the most. But he knows he will always get a reaction from me on the field and that's what he wants. \"You can bollock some players and they will go into a shell, whereas others will think: 'Right, I'll show you.' Sometimes you get someone shouting back - maybe at half-time when all the tension is there - but not often. To be honest, though, I'm my own biggest critic anyway. I know when I'm not doing well. But I've also got huge belief in my own ability.\" Giggs has already had one weekend with the television remote control locked away and he does not intend to have another. Ryan Giggs' FA Cup finals v Chelsea 1994 After holding off United for 50 minutes Glenn Hoddle's side conceded two penalties and Alex Ferguson's men went on to win 4-0 for their first Double. Giggs' tenacity down the left set up the first penalty. v Everton 1995 Paul Rideout's header gave Everton a 1-0 win. Giggs came off the bench and produced a number of incisive crosses that almost earned an equaliser. v Liverpool 1996 In a match notorious for the white suits worn by the Liverpool players, Eric Cantona secured United's 1-0 win in an otherwise drab contest. Giggs was generally unimposing. v Newcastle 1999 Giggs' moment of glory came in the semi-final with his astonishing winner against Arsenal. In the final he provided some quality touches in an easy 2-0 victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
