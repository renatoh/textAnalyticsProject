By the 70th minute, Jens Lehmann was doing roly-polys to keep warm, such was the lack of anything approaching a serious threat to the German keeper. When the man of the match in these parts is not the sublime Thierry Henry and can be replaced by a player with the promise of Robin van Persie, as was the case of Alexander Hleb, then all would seem particularly tickety-boo in this part of North London. Yet, although they coasted it, there must be concerns over the rather brittle Arsenal rearguard. It will have to repel far better opponents than this insipid, rather negative Charlton side. Despite the clean sheet, Arsene Wenger must surely pray for a fit and focused Sol Campbell to return if his side are to secure Champions League football for next season. The idea of simple football deserted the visitors in the opening minutes and never returned. A long ball from Kolo Toure created indecision in Charlton's defence. This became the game's pattern. Emmanuel Adebayor drew a save and then had a far better chance. Jonathan Spector slipped while attempting a casual pass and the striker advanced on Thomas Myhre's goal - accompanied by a great Highbury roar. But the man from Togo dallied, then dallied some more and Spector made the recovering tackle. Whenever Arsenal's attacking play broke down, Charlton's clearing ball inevitably went over the top to the isolated Darren Bent, who was constantly caught offside. Then Arsenal scored. Jerome Thomas attempted a trick, but was dispossessed inside the Arsenal half. Hleb raced away with the ball and found Adebayor, who fed Thierry Henry inside the box. He seemed to have overrun it, but managed a superb cutback to Robert Pires, who could hardly miss. Henry turned provider again after 20 minutes, his swinging cross finding Adebayor, whose leap and header went close. It seems Wenger now has a more direct dimension when needed. Charlton had five players across midfield, which is negative unless there are men breaking regularly from that area. When Jason Euell did push up to support Darren Bent, he found some indecision in the home defence. This, though, may have been the product of lapsed concentration because of the lack of any real threat from Charlton. It was easy for Arsenal. Henry put a free-kick over the bar, then a challenge on Hleb inside the penalty area brought a furious Wenger to the technical area when Dermot Gallagher failed to blow his whistle. Hleb was the opening period's best performer, haring down the right wing, offering an outlet and pass that continually scared the fragile Charlton defence. Arsenal's second goal was a product of another Charlton howler, this time from Hermann Hreidarsson. The defender dwelled and allowed in Adebayor, who produced a convincing finish with the outside of his boot. Assurance, though, was a quality seemingly lacking from Henry's words before the kick-off regarding his future. 'There have been more stories about in the papers this week,' he had said. 'There are no quotes from me, no quotes from Barcelona, no quotes from anyone. If the papers want to speculate, they will. But my position remains exactly the same. Nothing has changed in the past couple of weeks.' Arsenal fans, though, may wonder what that position is. To concerned supporters, it may now be one that causes serious contemplation that their skipper's prevarication over a new contract means he is positioning himself for a diplomatic exit. Here is what the Frenchman said before Arsenal's 7-0 drubbing of Middlesbrough in mid-January: 'I thought the fans deserved to know where I was standing. It was important to tell them that I want to stay here.' In two months, the outright statement that he wishes to stay has vanished. Still, at 28 and in his seventh season at Highbury, he could hardly be faulted. Neither, of course, could Henry's or, indeed, his team's football. Five minutes after the break and a rout was threatened. Again it was Hleb who was in position to hurt Charlton. His emphatic strike from close range was just reward for a sparkling display. When he went off in the 67th minute, he received deserved applause. What of Charlton? Other than a chance for Thomas early on, Alan Curbishley's side were spectators for most of the second half. They lacked not just ideas, but also fight. Thomas should have scored following a mistake from a slumbering Phillipe Senderos, who still appears shaky at the more dangerous moments. The Charlton man may have been surprised to receive the opportunity when the Swiss defender failed to head clear but, from close range, he should have caused Lehmann to work harder. Henry, surely not for the last time, now played as if offering an exhibition. In this company at least, the game appears sumptuously easy for him. Most impressively, maybe, of all his attributes is that if not trying to score he becomes pivotal to the team effort. Here he operated supremely. How Arsenal must hope he is still around to do it at the new stadium next season. Man of the match - Alexander Hleb Now it can be seen why the Belarussian was signed. Teemed with menace and a joie de vivre that mark out the best Arsene Wenger players. The Frenchman must surely hope the man from Minsk can turn it on against Juventus when it is Champions League time again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
