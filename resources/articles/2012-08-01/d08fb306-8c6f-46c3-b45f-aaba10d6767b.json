When he was manager of West Bromwich Albion his side played an attack-minded 4-2-3-1 system, but he was sacked 18 months ago because the side conceded too many goals, among reports that little time was spent working on team shape in training. In stark contrast, Di Matteo won the Champions League last season by assembling an extremely defensive side that benefited from admirable organisation. His first league game as coach since signing a two-year deal offered no definitive answer to the tactics he will employ in 2012-13. After Chelsea raced into a 2-0 lead in only seven minutes, the onus was on Wigan to make the running for the rest of the game. The home side dominated possession, which says something about Di Matteo's approach. Other managers looking to shut down a match would have insisted upon ball retention to frustrate the opposition and slow the tempo, but Chelsea were more reactive, happy to drop deep towards their own goal. They attempted half as many passes in the final third as Wigan, and had only six shots. In the first half, however, we glimpsed a new Chelsea, a side that offered intelligent movement and interchanging of positions. Juan Mata started the game on the right of a 4-2-3-1, with Eden Hazard in the central attacking role behind Fernando Torres, and Ryan Bertrand on the left. Whereas Bertrand stuck to his flank, Mata and Hazard constantly switched positions, and Chelsea's creative threat stemmed from this area \u2013 Wigan's left-sided centre-back Iv\u00e1n Ramis was at fault for both goals on his debut. Chelsea dragged Wigan's three defenders out of position expertly in the first half, and last weekend's Community Shield match, against a Manchester City side who also played a back three, was good preparation for this test. It was intriguing that Mata and Hazard were positioned towards the right of the pitch in the first place. Bertrand was only playing because Ramires was ill, otherwise it would have been the same side that started the Community Shield. That alteration necessitated others changing roles \u2013 Ramires would have played on the right, whereas Bertrand is left-sided, but Hazard and Mata had no problems adapting. That is a key feature of the new Chelsea \u2013 versatile attackers. Hazard, Mata and new signing Marko Marin can all play on the left, the right or through the middle. The substitute Oscar can play on the right or in a central role, while rumoured target Victor Moses, an opponent in this match, offers similar flexibility. In addition to making Chelsea's line-ups difficult to predict, it will consistently offer greater lateral movement, as showcased by Mata and Hazard here. Rarely have Chelsea offered that quality \u2013 since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's reign, they've attacked directly, battering the opposition directly through sheer force. Just as Didier Drogba was suited to that strategy, Torres should be more at home with technically gifted team-mates. His own movement will depend on the location of Chelsea's creative talents. In this game, he started runs from the left of the pitch, so Hazard and Mata, from centre-right positions, could angle through-balls to meet his darts towards goal. He did not score, but he did receive service, which is promising considering Chelsea played the majority of the game cautiously. Despite significant summer signings, Torres remains Chelsea's most expensive asset, and with Daniel Sturridge the only competition for his place in the starting line-up, his role is crucial. As a player who thrives on space and through-balls, he will continue to appreciate the movement and invention of Mata and Hazard \u2013 whichever positions they're playing in. Arsenal should have more all-round attacking threat Martin O'Neill invariably instructs his sides to defend very deep when visiting the Emirates Stadium, so he must have been delighted to see Arsenal start with a front three of Theo Walcott, Lukas Podolski and Gervinho \u2013 who all base their game around pace. With no space to exploit in behind the Sunderland defence, this attacking trio was largely ineffective. Gervinho was the most involved player \u2013 his 20 attempted dribbles were the most in a Premier League game since Cristiano Ronaldo twice recorded this statistic in 2005/06, although the Ivorian's end product was inconsistent. Defending deep against Arsenal has long been the default strategy for opponents, but it was odd that Arsenal encountered this problem again. Never before has Arsene Wenger had so many tall, traditional centre-forwards, with Olivier Giroud, Nicklas Bendtner, Marouane Chamakh and Park Chu-Young to choose from \u2013 although Giroud wasn't 100% fit, and the other three may all leave before the end of the transfer window. Still, it was notable that when Podolski was replaced by Giroud, who offered a more physical threat inside the penalty box, Sunderland defended higher up the pitch to push him away from goal. That resulted in more space in behind, and Giroud had the game's best chance after a clever through-ball from Santi Cazorla. The combination of pace and height makes it much more difficult for the opposition to get their defensive line correct, and Arsenal have the attacking options to offer more of an all-round threat this season. Pardew experiments with new formation Alan Pardew showcased Newcastle's tactical flexibility in the second half against Tottenham, starting with a straight 4-4-2 system with Demba Ba upfront alongside Papiss Cisse, before switching to a 4-3-3 in the second half. He was able to make the change without using substitutions \u2013 Ba moved out to the left, from where he scored a fine opener, Hatem Ben Arfa moved higher up on the right, while Jonas Gutierrez moved from a left-wing position to the centre of midfield. Newcastle weren't comfortable winners, but it was an improvement from their first-half performance, when Tottenham had twice hit the woodwork. The purchase of Vernon Anita only furthers Newcastle's tactical options, as he can play in either full-back position, as a wide midfielder or in a holding role. Pardew showed great intelligence to vary Newcastle's system last year to incorporate Cisse, and it will be interesting to see how often he uses both formations within the same game this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
