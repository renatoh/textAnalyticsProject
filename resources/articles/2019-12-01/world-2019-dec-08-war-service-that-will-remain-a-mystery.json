He served in Holland, Belgium and France, and was evacuated at Dunkirk. For the rest of his life he suffered the after-effects, now labelled PTSD, and was never free of bouts of depression and insomnia/nightmares. How I wish I had understood what had happened to him. It was only while watching the BBC\u2019s World on Fire that the full horror of it all struck me. Above all, the sound of non-stop gunfire, shelling, shrieks, and the burning.
