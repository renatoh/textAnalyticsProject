You have to present an alternative", "bodyText": "Some time between Nigel Farage\u2019s plane crash (2010) and the publication of his memoir, The Purple Revolution (2015), I met him on a radio panel, a soft-chat, Sunday evening format where he talked about his testicle swelling to the size of a lemon when he was 21. Truthfully, I wasn\u2019t really listening until he got to the bit about the lemon, so thought this related to the plane crash, and I got told off by the producer afterwards for not taking testicular cancer seriously. By far the greater mistake was not taking Farage seriously. At this point, he didn\u2019t really register as a political force. Ukip, much talked about in the 00s, had been sidelined by the austerity agenda, on which he didn\u2019t have a lot to say. Yet he was considered clubbable, easy on the ear, a reliable and likable controversialist, and maintained a media presence on that basis. Across the whole spectrum of opinion, from those who agreed with him some of the time to those who loathed everything he stood for, the same underestimation was made: just how far he would go to harness any underlying rage he perceived, and how well-grounded his perception was. It was clear as the Brexit result was announced that he would not stop there: in common with Donald Trump\u2019s triumph, his victory speech was marked by the splenetic drum beat of \u201cthis is just the beginning\u201d. So even though there is no obvious logical connection between opposing Brussels and rejecting lockdown to quell a virus \u2013 the aim of his new Reform UK party \u2013 there is an emotional one. It was remarked by allies of Farage last month that he had identified a section of 2019 Conservative voters, perhaps even a third of them, who were already dissatisfied on three counts. These are described by Patrick O\u2019Flynn in the Spectator as \u201can apparent failure to stand up for British history and culture; opposition among libertarian-inclined people to lockdown measures and the continuing chaotic immigration system\u201d. There are mistakes we don\u2019t need to make twice or, indeed, for the 75th time. Pointing out what is really meant by \u201cBritish culture\u201d \u2013 a mash-up of \u201cblitz spirit\u201d, colonial greatness (all the cash, none of the cruelty), women who knew their place, and Victoria sponge \u2013 is all just a trashy pastiche conjured by people who, even if this era had existed, weren\u2019t born in time for it, is not worth your breath. Farage and his new party, just like the others, thrive on scorn. The more they are held in contempt by reasonable opinion, the more legitimate their rage against the elites. It\u2019s a jiu-jitsu move which, again, makes total emotional sense. Noting that many of Farage\u2019s supporters are older voters, the very people lockdown is designed to protect, will not help: there is a kamikaze spirit to this political force, which doesn\u2019t just disregard GDP, unemployment, seven-mile lorry queues and ICU numbers, but actively thrives on the negatives; laughing in the face of pain is proof of its courage, sincerity and passion. Finally, on that \u201cchaotic immigration\u201d, making humanitarian arguments is perhaps the greatest mistake of all. This has certainly been the most profound shock of our current politics: that cruelty, once it finds its political expression, cannot be fought on its own terms. If you get to the point where a five-year-old and an eight-year-old can drown in the English Channel, and a vigilante vowing to patrol the seas for migrants \u2013 for clarity: not to help them, but to hinder \u2013 is represented on BBC news as a voice of salt-of-the-earth Brits, the infinite preciousness of every human life is not going to cut it in this debate. The answer is the same here as it is anywhere; how do you argue with climate deniers? How do you argue with the alt-right? How do you argue with racists and incels, and QAnon? You don\u2019t: all you can do is build an alternative. The consequence of underestimating Nigel Farage originally has been a mad compensatory scramble to understand him and his movement, recognise the grievance, represent its concerns, pay due respect to its authenticity. On the lockdown issue particularly, you could seek common ground with Reform UK (whose name change from the Brexit party, incidentally, was registered over a week ago \u2013 could Boris Johnson have been the last person in the country to see this lockdown coming?). The libertarian arguments might be bilge, but elements of the case make more sense: that lockdowns can never work without competent test-and-trace systems working alongside them, that the toll on mental health is too great. It is in the nature of reasonable, adult discourse to seek common ground and build on it. But consensus is not what the Farage spirit seeks. As soon as you\u2019ve found it, he\u2019ll be haring off to the next demand, that all EU citizens be sent home, or that gunboats line the Channel, or whatever fresh hell it might be. The job of vanquishing Farage, this time, is neither in hand-wringing about his callousness, nor in celebrating a lockdown that nobody is looking forward to, but in building a plan for what comes next. The Conservatives, as a party of vision or direction, are a spent force: they will be buffeted by whichever wind is the strongest. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
