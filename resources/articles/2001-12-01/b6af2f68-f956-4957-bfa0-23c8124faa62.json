It published results of a survey of doctors' opinions showing four out of 10 GPs in their 20s and 30s want to reduce their hours of work within the next five years and more than half are planning to retire early. Doctors' leaders were surprised to find that more than three-quarters of GPs under 30 were women. Less than a fifth had children, but most would be expecting to start raising families in their 30s - taking maternity leave and perhaps switching to part-time working during the children's early years. John Chisholm, chairman of the BMA's general practitioners' committee which conducted the survey, said: \"We are already critically short of family doctors. For patients, the result is consultations that are too short and sometimes longer waiting times than are desirable. \"The detailed analysis of our survey results by age demonstrates that matters are likely to get worse. The newest recruits to general practice are not intending to follow the same full-time career path as their older colleagues.\" The BMA told the government last year that it would have to recruit at least 10,000 extra family doctors in England to achieve the goals in the NHS plan, including higher standards of primary care and more minor surgery in GP clinics. Ministers said the most they were likely to manage by 2004 was an extra 2,000. The latest survey of GP vacancies showed 2,464 unfilled posts in April, compared with 1,214 a year before. A BMA spokeswoman said: \"The figures from this survey suggest we will need thousands more GPs than we estimated previously.\" Among GPs under 30, 76.5% were women, compared with 59.7% of those aged 30-34, 43.7% of those aged 35-44, 29.8% of those aged 45-54 and 20.3% of those aged 55-64. Among GPs under 30, 19.6% had at least one child, compared with 58.2% aged 30-34 and 85.1% aged 35-44. \"This suggests GPs are having children, albeit later than other sections of the population,\" she said. \"They will either stop work or reduce their working commitment for a while. Both men and women GPs may want to work part-time.\" The figures came from an age analysis of a survey of 23,521 GPs in October. It found enthusiasm among younger GPs was higher, with a third of GPs in their 20s reporting low morale, compared with more than 70% of those over 45. Younger GPs were less likely to favour single-handed practices and more likely to want to work for a salary instead of as a self-employed contractor to the NHS. But young and old were united in their belief in the health service. More than 85% of those who completed the survey thought the majority of general practice should continue to remain within the NHS. Asked if they would prefer to work in the NHS rather than the private sector if pay, conditions and workload were similar, almost nine out of 10 said they would. Dr Chisholm said the result of negotiations on a new GP contract should be ready to submit to doctors in April. Some changes might require primary legislation, but that should not be used as an excuse for delay in implementing the bulk of the deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
