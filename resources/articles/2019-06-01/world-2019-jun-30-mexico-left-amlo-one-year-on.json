So instead of hobnobbing with other G20 leaders in Japan, the president known popularly as \u201cAmlo\u201d was in Mexico City, preparing to address thousands of supporters in the city\u2019s central square on Monday. During last year\u2019s election campaign, L\u00f3pez Obrador drew comparisons with Donald Trump for his appeal to ordinary people, his disdain for elites and critical media. And like Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador hasn\u2019t stopped campaigning since he took office. Throughout the past year, L\u00f3pez Obrador has criss-crossed the country with a string of public appearances in which he has promised jobs, development and infrastructure projects. Unlike Trump, however, L\u00f3pez Obrador has remained broadly popular, with an approval rating hovering at around 70%. Analysts attribute his enduring appeal to his success at upending a political system which most voters perceived as riddled with corruption privileges and rigged against the interests of ordinary Mexicans. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking the levers of power away from those that have always screwed over everyone else and making sure that political power will not be used against the people,\u201d said Federico Est\u00e9vez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s win was hailed as a turning point for Mexico\u2019s left, as the famously frugal president took the discourse of a fairer country to the presidential palace when he took office on office 1 December 2018. But although L\u00f3pez Obrador declared neoliberalism \u201cdead\u201d in Mexico, his austerity turned out to be more than personal: he has slashed social spending and fired thousands of civil servants. And under the relentless attacks from Donald Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador has steadfastly refused to rise to the bait: he agreed to crack down on migration enforcement to avert US tariffs on Mexican exports, and his government beat Canada and the US to sign off first on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, which replaced Nafta. Meanwhile he has deployed the army for security duties and aligned with evangelical pastors to push a \u201cmoral agenda\u201d for Mexico. \u201cL\u00f3pez Obrador is looking ever more conservative in classic terms. He doesn\u2019t raise taxes and he doesn\u2019t raise spending,\u201d Est\u00e9vez said. \u201cHe\u2019s a left-wing populist on distributive issues, but he\u2019s conservative on social issues.\u201d Like Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador often lambasts the media for hostile criticism, and critical reporters often become the targets of social media pile-ons by the president\u2019s supporters. The president communicates through gestures: he rides in a modest family car, takes commercial flights and drops in unexpectedly to eat at roadside restaurants. \u201cI never met a president before,\u201d said Gregorio Chabl\u00e9, a Mayan man who snapped a photo of L\u00f3pez Obrador lunching a seafood joint in his hometown south of Playa del Carmen. Later that day, he brought his friends and family to a L\u00f3pez Obrador rally and slipped the president a thank you note. Chabl\u00e9 was thankful for L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s programs of stipends for young people, seniors \u2013 including his mother \u2013 and the disabled. His brother now receives \u00a3105 ($133) every two months to care for his daughter Down\u2019s syndrome. But as L\u00f3pez Obrador ramps up stipend payments, he has cut social spending and sent the savings to Pemex, the state oil company, according to analysts. He has also pushed a suite of mega-projects, including railways and a massive refinery \u2013 starting construction before finishing environmental impact studies and consultations with indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, in response to the violent crime which continues to convulse the country. L\u00f3pez Obrador has formed a new militarized police force, but the critics saw peril in handing over public security duties to the military \u2013 an institution the Mexican left has long distrusted. \u201cWe never imagined the army would take on this role ... or the state would be slimmed so much,\u201d said Emiliano Ruiz Parra, a journalist who covered L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s first unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2006. \u201cI never imagined L\u00f3pez Obrador would pursue these kinds of policies.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
