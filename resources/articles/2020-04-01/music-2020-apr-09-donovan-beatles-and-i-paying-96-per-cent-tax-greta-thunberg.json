You don\u2019t have to be a boomer to remember Mellow Yellow, although it may help if you want to remember his famous stand-off with Bob Dylan in Don\u2019t Look Back, a really poignant moment of the old folk against the new (Dylan, new folk in this narrative, is actually older by four years, Donovan is keen to stress). Now 73 and living in Ireland, he has wild grey hair and a gentle, thoughtful face; he looks, in real life, like an atmospheric black-and-white photo of a folk singer. His conversation is as wild as his hair, completely ungoverned by conventions such as sticking to the point or answering the bloody question. His mind comes into focus every now and then, when he wants to tell me what to write, how to write it and how to ask a question. I have actually since considered some remote therapy to try and figure out why this annoyed me so much. Anyway, he is out of retirement with Eco-Song, a tribute album to Greta Thunberg that he has recorded with his wife, Linda. No, wait, it\u2019s not a tribute album; it\u2019s an album of songs from across his career with an eco theme, waiting to be turned into a \u201cstage opera\u201d. He and Linda want to take it to schools, to universities, want the youth performing it up and down the land. They have a plot strung around the songs \u2013 four young students in Cork, meeting up on a Friday night, after a climate strike \u2013 but, for the time being, the songs have been released as a standalone CD. A month ago, in an entirely different world, he was planning to take it on tour. We met before the lockdown in a London hotel; the coronavirus crisis was serious enough then that we bumped elbows as I came in, unserious enough that we forgot not to shake hands at the end, serious enough that his roadie immediately handed him some hand sanitiser. Donovan wanted to explain why he and Linda have dedicated themselves to Thunberg. It starts in quite an unlikely place, this explanation \u2013 with Mary Shelley, who first sounded the alarm about the dangers of science while all the great poets were silent (\u201cShe was the wife of the poet Shelley, we know that now,\u201d he says, in a tone of aching significance, though surely we knew that then). \u201cAnd her monster, science, is now raging throughout the earth.\u201d OK \u2026 \u201cIt was a young woman who sounded the alarm back then. And I rang the bell, 50 years ago, in 1968, alone among my song-poet peers.\u201d I think he means the bell for nuclear disarmament. His lyrics, from the start, often had a pacifist edge, along with social conscience; he performed at benefit gigs for striking shipbuilders, contributed two songs to Ken Loach\u2019s Poor Cow (which was to domestic violence what Cathy Come Home was to homelessness). Mellow Yellow may be the song that floats to the top of the memory, but \u201celectrical banana / is gonna be a sudden craze\u201d is by no means the summit of his lyrical endeavour. \u201cWe actually invaded pop culture with meaningful lyrics,\u201d he says. He was very anti-nuclear \u2013 and still is \u2013 but I could get no further detail on which bell he is talking about, that he rang and none of the other song-poets did. Never mind that now. \u201cAnd then, 50 years later, in 2018, a wee lass called Greta rings the bell again. At first, she\u2019s alone. Linda and I waited to see if her generation would have their own songwriters. But they had none.\u201d (I would love to drill into this large statement, that there are no songwriters in Generation Z. But Donovan expressly forbade any questions until the tea had arrived.) \u201cRebellions and movements need songs. And Linda and I found it extremely significant that it was Mary, not the poets, and it\u2019s again a young woman, it\u2019s Greta, pointing to the disaster approaching.\u201d The male domination of science and industry has meant that there\u2019s no nurture, anywhere, nature has been raped and pillaged by the male sensibility. It\u2019s always a woman who sounds the alarm \u2013 although, in this timeline, Donovan appears to be an honorary one. Ah, tea. So, about this eco-mission \u2026 In fact, it is a bit of a stretch to talk about \u201cretirement\u201d, since it is only five years ago that he was releasing a greatest hits album to celebrate 50 years since his first release, and even more years of being Donovan, \u201ca kid with a guitar, and a song, and a hat, and a harmonica, the traditional troubadour, minstrel, bard, in the old Gaelic tradition\u201d. He grew up in Glasgow, of Scottish and Irish descent, in a song-filled house that was also alive with his photographer father\u2019s unpublished poetry. He has had periods of intense introspection, deepening his relationship with transcendental meditation with sundry Beatles, mainly George Harrison, and periods of hightailing it to Bhutan and Nepal to meet Buddhists in exile, but since he got his first contract in 1964, he has never really stopped releasing music. It\u2019s the mission, he explains. He has to go wherever the mission takes him. Nevertheless, you\u2019d call the 60s his heyday, the decade of Epistle to Dippy and The Hurdy Gurdy Man, often playing on his own, doors swinging open wherever he went. Anyway, the tea is here and I am allowed to ask a question, except: \u201cFirst I\u2019m going to read you something. It takes four minutes. I\u2019ve measured it. It\u2019s the mission that has brought Donovan and Linda back in the saddle. If you want me to expand, I can. \u2018Tell me more,\u2019 you should say.\u201d He then reads me the speech, which is essentially a longer version of what he had already told me about the young-women-plus-Donovan bell-ringers before the tea. As the encounter turns into something more like a recognisable conversation, he circles again and again back to the start of his career, meeting Linda, losing her, finding her again. He is the most fantastic name-dropper, but if you ask him for any more detail \u2026 \u201cAh, celebrities,\u201d he says, knowingly. \u201cYou want to hear about the celebrities.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it, how that connects with \u2026\u201d he\u2019ll begin, before haring off to the absolutely least connected thing. He is delightful and maddening, although maddening can get the upper hand. Sod it, let\u2019s start where he wants to start \u2013 at the beginning, with his unholy talent. While the Beatles were doing their famous 10,000 hours gigging in Hamburg, he didn\u2019t need to do all that (although he did play Hamburg once, in 1965 \u2013 \u201cIt was like a Popeye cartoon: the street was like madness, sailors and tourists and police. Halfway through singing my first song, the wall behind me collapsed and the club behind broke into mine, and everybody was fighting\u201d). \u201cI realised television was for me; I picked it up very quickly. Everything \u2013 jazz, blues, folk, pop music, literature, feminism, ecology \u2013 I just absorbed it like a sponge, and I was prepared, because I had had poetry of noble thought read to me as a child.\u201d He was recording a demo in London when Brian Jones, the founder of the Rolling Stones, walked in. \u201cHe knew that I was something that was going to happen, and he said to Ready, Steady, Go [like a 60s Top of the Pops, only bohemian]: \u2018If you don\u2019t have him on, you\u2019re going to be sorry.\u2019\u201d He thus got his first TV performance before he had even released a single, and slips into the third person, awestruck. \u201cAnd suddenly, he connected with millions of people. How did he do that? And the cameraman loved it, and the directors loved it, and the producers loved it. How did I learn it so early? Because, what I\u2019m about to sing to you, you already know.\u201d The Gaelic singer-songwriter tradition is actually four: \u201cpoetry, music, theatre and radical thought\u201d. Or perhaps it was astrological: \u201cI\u2019m a Taurus, and the Taurus\u2019s area is the throat, and I\u2019m very highly skilled with vocalising. I can really impress and project a very special feeling.\u201d And then he veers into reincarnation: \u201cDid I learn this before I was born? Or is it a continuum, that you are actually not a person, but a force, you are an energy, and this energy is manifesting itself in a character called Donovan, but I don\u2019t own it, it\u2019s part of a tradition?\u201d That night on Ready, Steady, Go was fateful for another reason \u2013 he met a woman called Linda Lawrence in the green room, \u201call dressed in black, pure, white, blanched face, a bohemian girl. My dream.\u201d They were both just 18, but things were already quite complicated. She wanted to marry Brian Jones, with whom she had a child. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t his first girlfriend \u2013 he had two or three kids already. He was like the god Pan; he was spreading kids around every six months.\u201d That\u2019s one way of putting it, I guess. Jones drowned in a swimming pool at the sadly young age of 27 in 1969, although not before he had counselled Linda that, even though \u201cwhere he was going, she couldn\u2019t follow\u201d, she should choose someone other than Donovan as her next partner, someone mature. Whether heeding this or for some other reason, she went to Los Angeles on her own (later moving her young son over to the US to be with her), and Donovan, bereft, went to Japan. Because, \u201ccan you believe that in 1969 the government were taxing the Beatles and I and others 96%?\u201d Why, yes, I can believe it, because I recall a whiny Beatles song about it. \u201cTaxman,\u201d he croons momentarily. \u201cBut still, we were rich. I don\u2019t think we ever saw any real money, because we were moving so fast and doing exactly what we wanted to do. We never had a purse.\u201d Ah, hippies; too cool to have a wallet, never so cool as to forget about money altogether. \u201cAs long as I didn\u2019t put my foot on UK soil, I didn\u2019t have to pay any income tax. It wasn\u2019t the money, it was the principle.\u201d The Japanese tour was flat, not for audiences, but for Donovan, who was miserable. It wasn\u2019t drugs and he wasn\u2019t overly crazy on alcohol, he just had a broken heart and it\u2019s hard to stay interested in your mission through one of those. \u201cWithout the mission, I wasn\u2019t in good shape,\u201d he says. \u201cGypsy Dave was always with me.\u201d Gypsy Dave crops up a lot when he talks. He was there at the start, apparently, when they were sleeping rough in Liverpool (\u201cWell, on benches in graveyards, with a sleeping bag; but that was the rough. The smooth was in St Ives, sleeping on a beach under the stars\u201d). Dave makes sage remarks throughout the Linda separation (\u201cThere are plenty more fish in the sea\u201d), but it remains hard, maybe because of his handle, to remember that he was a real person, the sculptor and songwriter Gyp Mills, rather than a kind of spirit animal. Anyway, it was Dave who insisted that he couldn\u2019t keep on gigging in Japan when his heart wasn\u2019t in it, that he had to go home. \u201cMy agent, Vic Lewis, said: \u2018As soon as you put your foot on [the British airline] BOAC in Tokyo, you\u2019re on British soil \u2013 the whole tax plan is out of the window. I was about to earn more than any British artist had ever earned on a year dropout \u2013 $7m. Today it would probably be a lot more. Vic was on his knees in the airport, because he stood to get 10%.\u201d I quite like this tableau, the mystic bard shuffling sadly on to a plane, foregoing his ancient principle of opposing a supertax, as his agent prostrates himself on the ground for his lost 700 grand. Where\u2019s Hans Holbein when you need him? So he was home, and Linda had come back to England, too, after life in the US got too dicey. The drug dealers were moving in, and he takes an interesting detour through the end of the psychedelic dream. \u201cThe drugs were quite safe to begin with, but as the 60s progressed, it was becoming big business, and a lot of our songs were singing about it. So it became like we were the ones who were commercially promoting it.\u201d The pair reunited in 1970 in a touching scene involving a cow. \u201cWe walked up to the woods, me with my guitar, and we sat in the field, and we didn\u2019t say anything. Until I said: \u2018Do you want to get married now?\u2019 And she said: \u2018I still feel the same.\u2019 And I started singing a song, and a cow came up and licked Linda\u2019s face while I was singing. I\u2019d never heard of anything like that happening. And you can\u2019t make that up.\u201d It must be a Taurus thing. If his first decade of fame was all about love found and lost, its eventual resolution liberated both Donovan and Linda to delve into the deeper significance of the human condition \u2013 transcendental meditation. \u201cMe, David Lynch, Paul McCartney, but don\u2019t focus on me, focus on what the teaching says. This might be part of your article.\u201d O \u2026 K. \u201cThere are three levels of consciousness, waking, sleeping and dreaming, and we move between the three of them. But there is a fourth level, superconscious transcendental vision.\u201d If you never access that, you never truly relax, and this \u2013 in a roundabout but mainly non-verbal way, explains why the world is in such a mess and we stockpile nuclear weapons. \u201cYet why have we not already destroyed ourselves? Why has it not already happened?\u201d Go on then, wise guy\u2026 \u201cWell, it\u2019s extraordinary in itself.\u201d On the plus side, everything you need to know is already inside you \u2013 you just need to access it. Will our self-awareness come too late to halt the climate crisis? \u201cGreta says \u2018no\u2019. Her generation is saying \u2018no\u2019. It is an extraordinary mission, and the mission is eco. And I think that\u2019s it.\u201d Encounter completed. I don\u2019t know what Greta Thunberg is going to make of this intervention. But I hope Donovan\u2019s tour goes ahead in the future, if only because I am hoping for a future in which all tours go ahead. \u2022 Donovan\u2019s album Eco-Song is available to download at donovan.ie. The rescheduled show at Cadogan Hall, London, will take place on 12 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
