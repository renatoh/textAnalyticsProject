The EADS board blamed a row amongst its four supporting governments \u2014 Britain, France, Germany and Spain \u2014 over the national share of production of the new A350 long-haul jet for its decision. It is understood that France demanded the lion's share of work on new technology to be installed in the planes. Louis Gallois, Airbus chief executive, was due to present Power8, his restructuring plan, to unions and the media in Toulouse on Tuesday. It envisages the loss of up to 10,000 jobs, including some 2,000 in Britain, and the sale or closure of three or four of Airbus's 16 European plants. But Mr Gallois, is understood to have clashed with his German counterpart, Tom Enders, over whether his plan would deliver annual savings of \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.35bn) a year by 2010 \u2014 and over the concentration of technological workload in France. Britain, which is still seeking a place on the EADS board, insists that it retains 20% of the workload and it is understood that Alistair Darling, industry secretary, thought he had achieved a restatement of earlier commitments in talks with Mr Gallois last week. Spain traditionally has a 10% workload and France and Germany 35% each. The two British plants\u2014 Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol \u2014 employ just under 13,000 and have been guaranteed arole in designing and building wings for the Airbus fleet. But design work on new composite, carbon-fibre wings for the A350 is to be completed in a German plant. Mr Gallois, sources close to the EADS board said, had presented a balanced programme of job-cuts designed to achieve his target of saving \u20ac5bn between now and 2010 and \u20ac2bn a year thereafter. His plan also aims to reduce the period required to develop a new plane by two years to five-and-a-half years, cut overhead costs by 30% and raise productivity by 20%. Many of the job losses would occur among back office and contracting staff while two German plants \u2014 Varel and Nordenham \u2014 and M\u00e9aulte and, possibly, Saint-Nazaire in France would be sold or closed. He said EADS needed to \"very quickly find a solution that overcomes national issues\" and insisted that his proposals were \"balanced, both from an industrial and technological point of view, and which serve our objective of economic competitiveness.\" His main aim is to offset the crippling effect of the weak dollar on Airbus finances. He added: \"I wish that they [the proposals] can lead to the consensus we urgently need. Airbus cannot delay any longer implementing Power8. Quite naturally, employees are eager to know how the future of their company together with their own future is being shaped.\" But it is understood that Mr Enders led a posse of German directors questioning whether the Gallois plans would deliver the promised savings and insisting that they be so watertight they would not have to be revised in a year's time. Mr Enders also demanded that future technological work be shared out proportionately to national interests, criticising his French counterpart for concentrating this in France. German union leaders expressed fears that their plants' share of work on the A350 would be a nominal 35% in volume but 10% in real terms. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
