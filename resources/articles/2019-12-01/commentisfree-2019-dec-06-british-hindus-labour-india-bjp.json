Mine is of a young man on a ship in 1959. He had \u00a35 in his pocket and a sweetheart who could only join him a few years later, once he had worked and saved enough to make them a home. The less romantic story is of racism and violence. First there was the horrific brutality between fellow Hindus and Muslim neighbours that my parents witnessed before they left India. Then they were attacked by far-right skinheads as they pushed me in my pram in north London. Still they believed in the power of democracy, of votes inspired and earned with ideas and policies; not those bought or demanded on the basis of faith, race or hate. A classic racist smear on members of any minority ethnic community is that we are somehow not to be trusted because of allegiances to foreign powers. We remember Norman Tebbit\u2019s infamous \u201ccricket test\u201d aimed at Commonwealth migrants and their kids. Jewish people the world over are painfully aware of stereotypes about their politics in general, or views on any particular action by any Israeli government of the day. And after last Friday\u2019s appalling murders at London Bridge, innocent British Muslims will once more fear guilt by association and even reprisals. So how irresponsible for any group with self-proclaimed primary allegiance to politics elsewhere in the world to feed such smears and conspiracies by actively intervening in an election here in the UK. I am talking about a sinister campaign that uses WhatsApp messages demanding that Britons of Indian-Hindu extraction vote Conservative on the basis that Labour members such as me are \u201ctraitors to their ancestral land, to their family and friends in India and to their cultural heritage\u201d. The Times of India reports that an organisation called the Overseas Friends of the BJP (Bharatiya Janata party) has identified 48 Labour-Tory marginal seats in which to campaign, spread fear and sow division. In July this year, Canadian officials reported the very same group spreading misinformation to influence Canada\u2019s October election. Labour is accused of being pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu. This is simply not true. Human rights cannot be the preserve of any one group. They belong to everyone, everywhere, including in conflict-ridden Kashmir. Labour has unequivocally condemned terrorism in that region, and called for India and Pakistan to come to peaceful resolution and respect human rights. This has also been the consistent, publicly stated policy of the Conservative government. It is particularly bizarre that some of the messages circulating include Islamophobic rants by Katie Hopkins. When my father received his \u201cpaki-bashing\u201d while trying to protect me and my mum in 1969, the fascists forgot to check whether he was Indian or Pakistani. I doubt the far-right thugs of today are any more discriminating. To add insult to injury, the Tory candidate in my late parents\u2019 constituency of Harrow East seems to be up to his neck in this cynical attempt at divide and rule by faith. People in Harrow have already spoken out. Bob Blackman is neither Hindu nor Muslim but employs this far-right playbook at the expense of others so as to weigh their votes without counting the long-term cost of fanning the flames of racial tension. It is awful to admit, because I miss my parents every day, but it is a small consolation that they did not live to see this behaviour in the place they crossed the world for and where they invested their entire adult lives. So before this election, I am returning to my childhood home to ask people to vote Labour \u2013 not on sectarian lines but for the schools, hospitals, universities and housing that all families deserve. I will ask them to vote to halt a climate emergency that knows neither national nor religious borders. And to vote for personal and community security and for peace. I will remind them that burning towers and hostile environments protect no community over another. I\u2019ll never urge people to vote on grounds of faith or race. And if I meet some Conservative voters, I will not call them \u201ctraitors\u201d of race or class, but attempt to engage on the policies that might best advance their families, communities, our country and the planet. If some say the odds are against us and the cynical status quo too much like a law of physics, I will ask them to lend us their votes and imaginations for this one momentous general election. This far-right playbook is neither Conservative nor \u201cone nation\u201d. It is taking its inspiration from the worst foreign politics more than any migrant ever did. This divisive nightmare has to end. \u2022 Shami Chakrabarti is shadow attorney general for England and Wales"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
