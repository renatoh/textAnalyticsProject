Shares in the troubled financial services group, which also carries out debt collection, ended the day 18% lower at 63p after it revealed it needed to take an extra charge of as much as \u00a322m because customers were failing to repay their loans. The shares have halved in a year. The charge, combined with new regulations from the Financial Services Authority (FSA), means that the bank has a shortfall of \u00a313m in the amount of capital it must keep to appease the regulator. It is likely to report a loss for 2007. The bank, which has had failed takeover approaches from two suitors, will shrink its business by reducing the number of loans it grants until it can rectify the situation with the FSA. Talks begin this week. Robin Ashton, chief executive for just five weeks, was keen to distance the group's problems from those at Northern Rock, which ran out of cash when it could no longer borrow on the financial markets. \"We have facilities from banks and fixed term deposits. The liquidity position is as strong as it has ever been,\" he said. Ashton said the group was looking at a number of options which include: the FSA rethinking its capital requirements; raising capital through a share issue or subordinated debt; or sales of parts of the business. \"All those options will be put to the FSA,\" Ashton said. The FSA is implementing new regulations today, known as Basel II. They are being introduced internationally and mean the amount of capital banks need to keep as a cushion is assessed on the basis of the risks they run. The \u00a322m increase in the impairment charge has been caused by its consumer credit arm, where the bank has been implementing a radical restructuring. This has included halving the number of branches to 52. Ashton, who was chief executive of larger rival Provident Financial until 2006, said the need for larger provisions was not caused by changes in the wider economy but because of problems specific to London Scottish Bank. The smaller number of branches was disrupting the collection of debts, some of which is done by agents visiting customers in their homes. Ashton stressed that other parts of the London Scottish Bank business were thriving - notably its debt collection arm Robinson Way, which contributes more than 50% of profits. The previous management had already begun a programme to restructure the troubled consumer credit business and expand Robinson Way and the London Scottish Mortgages operation. It sold off its leasing business and its head office, boosting its coffers by \u00a342m this year. The business is now likely to make a loss of around \u00a35m for the year to end-October. Until yesterday, analysts had been expecting \u00a317m of profits before a one-off charge relating to the company's broking arm. The group has found itself short of regulatory capital after the FSA demanded it adopt an interim individual capital guidance, which specifies the amount of capital it must hold. The interim ICG requires the group to hold \"significantly more regulatory capital\" than the previous international regime, known as Basel I. Explainer: Home credit firms The credit crunch should allow businesses like that run by London Scottish Bank to thrive as customers find it more difficult to borrow from traditional high street lenders. Provident Financial, the biggest doorstep lender, has revealed that it has experienced an uplift in loan applications since the high street banks began to tighten their lending criteria owing to the ongoing credit crisis. The home credit industry is the place rejected applicants can turn. Home credit firms - or doorstep lenders - lend to customers with poor credit histories and low incomes but charge higher rates of interest, sometimes as high as 100% a year. It is a business that has been investigated by the competition commission, which reckoned borrowers were ripped off by up to \u00a3100m a year - although the watchdog failed to put a cap on the rate lenders can charge. For London Scottish Bank, though, the credit crunch has not fuelled business. New chief executive Robin Ashton believes its problems are caused by a decision to halve its branch network. This led to difficulties in collecting loan repayments. On the other hand, its debt collection business, Robinson Way is racing ahead because of the credit crisis. The Bank has also been hit by a demand from the Financial Services Authority (FSA) for more capital to back its business. New rules require the FSA to base its capital requirements on the risks associated with a company's business. Something has clearly made the regulator attach more risk to London Scottish Bank."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
