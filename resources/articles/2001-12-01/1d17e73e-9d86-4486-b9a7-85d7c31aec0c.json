Stevens, runner-up twice in the UK and once the world championships, achieved little last season except for a run to the world semi-finals at the Crucible in Sheffield. His father, who had invariably travelled with him to tournaments even from his junior days, died unexpectedly in February and the 24-year-old Welshman has found it difficult to recover his former drive and feel for the game. Having trailed 5-1, White failed to capitalise on two good chances to close to 5-6, Stevens eventually taking the 11th frame on the black. After Stevens had gone three up with four to play with a break of 93, White salvaged the next frame from 0-49 and then added another to reduce his arrears to 7-8. Stevens, who has acquired a history of losing from well in front, was by now under pressure but kept White scoreless in the 16th frame to snuff out a spirited late rally by the Londoner. Ronnie O'Sullivan, who recently confirmed that he is taking Prozac to help control his clinical depression, encountered only token resistance in seizing an 8-0 overnight lead over Dave Finbow, the world No47 from Worcester. Finbow is also on medication for an \"anxiety disorder\" and even after guaranteeing himself \u00a311,500 with two wins here remained adamant that he intends to retire to Spain at the end of the season and \"get a proper job\". He had \"had enough of playing\". Perhaps the presence of television cameras raised the pressure to a level with which Finbow could not cope. \"There are times when I've got no control over my cue whatsoever,\" he had confessed, and yesterday was one of them as he totalled only 90 points, with a highest break of 16, as the world champion O'Sullivan swept through the eight frames in 82 minutes, concluding with an imperious break of 130. Stephen Hendry, who won in Malta last week and hopes this week to equal Steve Davis's six UK titles, had a break of 127 in transforming an overnight 6-2 lead to a 9-2 victory over Mark Davis, the world No60. Hendry, the 32-year-old fifth seed, said: \"There were some scrappy frames yesterday but overall I felt pretty good. It's not quite like the good old days but it was nice to win the three frames as quickly as I did. \"I'm playing with lots of confidence and while I'm not saying I'll win the tournament, I've as good a chance as anyone.\" The eighth seed Stephen Lee ended the challenge of Finland's Robin Hull with a 9-4 win, matching the highest televised break of 136 and then beating it. The 27-year-old from Trowbridge put himself in pole position for the \u00a310,000 top- break prize by rattling in a 137 to round off his success. \"I felt a lot better today because I was more adjusted to the table and the arena,\" said Lee, the winner of the LG Cup in Preston earlier this season. \"The booths in which we played in the last round were a bit too extreme, but I put in quite a bit of practice after yesterday's session and scored a lot more freely.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
