Thus, Robert A Caro explains how and why Lyndon Johnson led the US senate to enact America's first civil-rights laws of the 20th century. This huge volume, the third of Caro's exhaustive four-part study of Johnson, paints a vivid and stunningly accurate picture of how business is done in the United States senate. We see Johnson - \"the greatest one on one salesman that ever lived\" - working behind the scenes, first to obtain power over his colleagues as majority leader, and then to use that power. Caro's Johnson lives up to the public's worst fears of what makes politicians tick. Beholden to Texas oil and gas interests, he takes on an incorruptible government regulator during the Truman administration. Using tactics that Joe McCarthy later popularised, Johnson first destroys the reputation of Leland Olds, an FDR democrat determined to prevent the power industry from gouging consumers, and then leads the senate in defeating Olds' nomination to the federal power commission. We see those same oil and gas companies delivering brown paper bags filled with hundred-dollar bills to Johnson's cronies in order to buy the senators' support for deregulation, and then bankrolling Johnson's political career. We see Johnson, as head of a senate investigation into American military preparedness, far more interested in his own publicity than in examining the procurement of weapons systems. When Johnson finally reaches his objective - he appears on the cover of Newsweek as America's \"Watchdog in Chief\" - he seems to lose interest in the subject. We wince at Johnson's cruelty to his secretary, his staff (they take dictation while he sits on the toilet) and even his family. Asked if he consults his wife about politics, he replies: \"I have a nigger maid and I talk things over with her too.\" We wince again as we see Johnson's shameless flattery of the speaker of the house of representatives, Sam Rayburn, kissing him on the top of his head, calling him \"my beloved\". To win over Richard Russell, the senate's most powerful and respected figure, Johnson suddenly discovers an interest in baseball, Russell's favourite pastime. And when the objects of his flattery, Russell and Rayburn (to both he says \"you are like a father to me\"), become regulars at his house for meals on Sunday, he has to make sure one is out of the house before the other arrives. Caro's Johnson gives new meaning to the phrase \"sucking up and pissing down\". But he is also determined, the \"hardest working man\" in American politics. And he has a gift for reading men. There is no place where that gift is more important than the US senate. Caro explains how Johnson lay low when he arrived in the senate in 1948, and learned. He learned the senate procedures, which allow a minority of senators to filibuster and thus kill legislation. He learned from Russell and the other southern senators, the barons who controlled the powerful committees that authorised and appropriated funds. He learned from pages (senate messengers) about the vanities, the frailties, and the weaknesses of his colleagues. And he read the men of the senate, one by one, selling himself as their friend, their political adviser, their sounding board, their Mr Fix-it. He also found a way to bridge the chasm between the southern conservatives in the Democratic party and the northern liberals, convincing each side that he was with them, that he \"shared their pain\". It all paid off. By 1954, Johnson was majority leader of a Democratic senate. And he was the most powerful majority leader in the senate's history. Johnson himself is quoted saying: \"I do understand power, whatever else may be said about me. I know where to look for it, and how to use it.\" And the senate under Johnson was, for the first time, no longer just the fiefdom of southern barons running their own committees and filibustering legislation that dared to touch on the sacred subject of segregation. Johnson knitted the committees together. He bent the barons to his will, sometimes with their acquiescence and sometimes despite themselves. He exercised power. He was \"master of the senate\". Once he had attained power, was Johnson's crucial role in passing civil-rights legislation a result of his ambition or his compassion? To this crucial question, Caro gives us no answer. Perhaps there is none. Johnson was determined to be president. He knew that he would never obtain the Democratic nomination if he were perceived in the north as a segregationist, if he didn't achieve something concrete for civil rights, if he didn't prove that he could deliver for the liberals. So his indispensable role in passing civil-rights legislation in 1957 was clearly driven by his burning desire for the presidency in 1960. But it was more than that. Caro also proves that Johnson was in a different category from the southern racists. Men such as Mississippi's senator James Eastland, who described blacks in Montgomery as \"slimy, juicy, unbearably stinking niggers... African flesh-eaters\", who called on whites to use \"guns, bows, and arrows, slingshots and knives... in pursuit of dead niggers\". (Still, Johnson did ensure that Eastland became chairman of the powerful senate judiciary committee where he could bury legislation to help end discrimination.) \"I never had any bigotry in me,\" Johnson assured liberal senators and the many journalists, such as Washington Post publisher Phil Graham, whom he courted and converted. But Caro also reveals a Johnson who could talk the talk of the southern caucus, who could convince true segregationists that he was on their side. The LBJ that comes through most clearly, though, is a man of compassion. A senator from Texas, yes. A leader of the southern bloc of senators who killed all the civil-rights legislation proposed by the Truman and the first Eisenhower administrations, yes. But more importantly, Johnson was a man who grew up poor, who picked cotton as a boy, who in his time had worked on backbreaking roadgangs, who was a school teacher for the poor, who helped Mexican-Americans and blacks during the Roosevelt administration, and who believed that blacks were not racially inferior but disadvantaged by circumstance and discrimination. And then, the brutal man, the man of power, the tool of oil and gas interests, accomplished something. He changed the history of the civil-rights movement. He showed that the democratic system works, that injustices could be overcome through the passage of laws. The American democratic system didn't work as quickly as it should have, slowed down as it was by the threat of a southern filibuster. But it did work, because the circumstances demanded it, and because a man of power made it work. Indeed, Caro straddles the great divide between historians who subscribe to the great men theory of history and those who believe change is a function of larger social and political forces. Caro explains how the Montgomery bus boycott, the rise of Martin Luther King, and the revulsion throughout America at southern tactics to suppress blacks, all combined to put enormous pressure on Washington to act. But then, one man put to use the skills he had honed during a decade in the senate. He cajoled, he compromised, he threatened, he promised, he told one side one thing and the other side another, he blustered, and then he won the critical votes on the floor of the senate that enabled passage of the 1957 civil-rights bill. Caro's account of this epic battle on the senate floor spans almost 200 pages. We see pragmatism and principle joining together with the political power of one man to pass the stripped-down voting-rights bill, the first piece of civil-rights legislation enacted in 82 years. Despite the relative weakness of the final law, most of America's civil-rights leaders supported the result, realising, as Johnson said in his unique way, that the senate had \"lost its virginity\" and more legislation would follow. And a few years later, when Johnson finally became president, the crucial legislation, the great Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, were passed, and helped end racial discrimination in America. It is hard to dispute Caro's conclusion that \"it was Lyndon Johnson, among all the white government officials in 20th-century America, who did the most to help America's black men and women in their fight for equality and justice. It was he who was, among all those officials, their greatest champion. And it was in 1957 - in that fight for the Civil Rights Act of 1957 - that Lyndon Johnson's capacity to one day be that champion was first foreshadowed.\" \u00b7 James P Rubin, Visiting Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics, was assistant US secretary of state from 1997-2000"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
