And yet Liz has, it would seem, got herself a clone. Perhaps Posh Spice ripping off the Liz look comes as no surprise; but Jade Goody (right)? According to the Daily Mirror, it would seem that she too has begun to resemble La Hurley. How? Well, aside from her svelte new figure, Jade, like Posh, has developed a Liz-style love of designer shades and glossy brunette locks (avec swishy fringe), and - stop the press - she, like Liz, has a son! If Jade's transformation continues, perhaps next we will see her in the front row at Versace - or better still, Jade and Jeff will start dining with Elton and David en France? The mind boggles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
