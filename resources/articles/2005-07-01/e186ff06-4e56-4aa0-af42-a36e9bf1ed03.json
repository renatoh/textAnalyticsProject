In some places the police will stop you; in others they don't care. Venice was one of the most successful places I went to in terms of busking, largely because the police are strict and, as a consequence, there was little competition. I simply set up beside the Africans selling handbags. They always have lookouts. Whenever they began to quickly pack up, I did the same. I would sit at the side of the road with my guitar, a policeman would walk past a few minutes later - then after I would start playing again. I didn't have much luck in Verona, but Ravenna was excellent - holidaying Italians are very generous - and I never had any trouble in Tuscany, except in Florence.
