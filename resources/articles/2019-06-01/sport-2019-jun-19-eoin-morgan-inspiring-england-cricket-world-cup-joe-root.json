Root happily provided support to Morgan during England\u2019s one-sided victory at Old Trafford on Tuesday, scoring 88 from 82 balls in classic fashion and contrasting style to the jaw-dropping 71-ball 148 that belied the captain\u2019s recent back spasms. Asked if he thought Morgan had such an innings in him, Root replied: \u201cYes. Definitely. A lot of the time he will play in that manner, very selflessly, potentially going a little bit too hard, because he wants to set the example. He\u2019s always been capable of doing it. It\u2019s great to see him doing it on this stage, in a World Cup. I\u2019m trying to find the right word to describe his innings. It was just phenomenal really, unbelievable ball striking and it completely took the game away.\u201d Root contributed 43 to the pair\u2019s third-wicket stand of 189 and felt his role in that situation was simply to get his partner back on strike, something he did 17 times during their 16.5 overs together at the crease. Root is the keystone to England\u2019s batting unit \u2013 their top-scorer so far in the competition with 367 runs \u2013 and he fancies Morgan\u2019s savage innings can truly inspire the team before Friday\u2019s meeting with Sri Lanka at Headingley. He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not even like Old Trafford is a small ground. It\u2019s a fantastic achievement, especially for someone with a dodgy back. It makes you wonder how bad it actually was. But it\u2019s a really good sign for the group having the captain in that sort of form. It gives the dressing room a huge amount of confidence.\u201d It is not only Morgan\u2019s bat that has England upbeat at present. The pace of Jofra Archer and Mark Wood continues to trouble opponents, with the pair not only sharing 21 wickets at this World Cup but also offering significant physical threat. This was underlined by the bouncer that struck Afghanistan\u2019s top-scorer, Hashmatullah Shahidi, on the head and broke his helmet. As well as raising questions about the ICC\u2019s concussion protocol \u2013 Shahidi said he defied doctors orders by batting on, hoping not to worry his mother watching on TV back home \u2013 it demonstrated Morgan\u2019s ruthless side in asking Wood to send down another bouncer immediately. Wood, who was affected by the blow but duly delivered on his captain\u2019s orders, was keen to stress that once a batsman resumes, the tactic is entirely fair game. \u201cI was concerned when I first hit him, it was a bit of a bad blow,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it\u2019s out of my hands really, you have to let the medical staff do their thing. I checked he was all right, said \u2018Are you OK\u2019, then it was back into game mode. \u201cMorgy wanted me to fire another few down. That\u2019s what the captain wants, you listen to orders and now that he\u2019s all right, it\u2019s game time again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
