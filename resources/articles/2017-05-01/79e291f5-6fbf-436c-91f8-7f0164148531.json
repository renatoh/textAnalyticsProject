Since finishing a disappointing seventh over 1500m at the Rio Olympic Games Muir has set five British and two European records at distances ranging from 1,000m to 5,000m. She believes Budd\u2019s time of 4min 17.57sec will be the next one to fall when she tackles the race at the Anniversary Games at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in July. \u201cZola\u2019s definitely one of the icons of British distance running and I know she\u2019s got a very quick time,\u201d Muir said. \u201cIf I was to break it, it would be great.\u201d Unsurprisingly she has no plans to emulate Budd by going barefoot. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m quite up for that one,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cMy lucky spikes are doing well so far, so I think I\u2019ll keep them on.\u201d Muir confirmed her intention to double up in the 1500m and 5,000m at the world championships, although her priority will be the shorter distance. Her main challengers over 1500m are again likely to be the Kenyan Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon and the Ethiopian Genzebe Dibaba, who won gold and silver in Rio, but Muir believes her rivals will look at her differently now she has run so many fast times and won double European Indoor gold in Belgrade over 1500m and 3,000m in March. \u201cBefore, I think they might not have taken me as seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cBut certainly now I\u2019ve run very quick times, I think we respect each other and they certainly recognise I\u2019m a threat. \u201cIt gives you a huge confidence boost standing on the line. Before I\u2019d be thinking: \u2018She can run this, she can run that, she\u2019s won that.\u2019 Now I\u2019m standing there thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve run 3:55 and got two gold medals.\u2019 It\u2019s great having that confidence on the start and knowing this is where I belong.\u201d Muir is likely to be one of the biggest home draws of the championships after her stunning performances in Belgrade but she feels she can deal with the pressure. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me that a couple of years ago, I probably would have been quite worried about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was pressure and I didn\u2019t deal with it very well. I got very nervous. Now I see pressure more as support.\u201d That support was evident when she arrived home in Scotland after her successes in Belgrade. \u201cIt was brilliant,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were media waiting for me in Glasgow Airport and people knew who I was on the bus and the train. It was lovely.\u201d Since her double gold at the European Indoors she has been on an altitude training camp in Font Romeu in the Pyrenees while also juggling work placements for her veterinary course at Glasgow University. With her first outdoor race of the season \u2013 at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene in three weeks \u2013 approaching she is now focusing on her training in Flagstaff, Arizona. There will not be any easing up when she celebrates her 24th birthday next week. \u201cIt\u2019s on a Tuesday so that means double circuits,\u201d she said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be too enjoyable. A little cake will be nice but I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be alcohol with Eugene on the horizon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
