This Mondeo of the outdoor circuit accordingly books acts who are miles from the cutting edge, embodied by headliners such as James and Reef. Arguably, Friday's main act, Pulp, are also no longer what they were, but landing them was a definite coup, bringing a touch of metropolitan cool to the suburbs. The lack of A-list allure was balanced by an attention to comfort that some would say has no place at a rock festival. Those people are wrong: how better to celebrate another ponderous set by Heathcliffian brooders Tindersticks than by drinking proper coffee, paying a visit to the Ritz of portaloos and browsing the herb stall selling pots of sage and mint? And it's easier to overlook the fact that festival openers Fuzz Light Years are several tunes short of a Blondie album when you don't have to track down the appropriate stage via a trail of noodles and pee. Though Saturday featured the Wurzels and Lonnie Donegan, Friday was the best value for one-day visitors. The Bollywood Brass Band were more Dixieland than Bollywood but entertaining anyway, and London newcomer Peppercorn is one of the more promising members of the not quite soul, not quite jazz sisterhood. Pulp, meanwhile, were worth the price of admission alone. There is an appealing symmetry about a band who made their name writing about the minutiae of suburbia playing Guildford, and a re-energised Jarvis Cocker seemed to have found his spiritual home. The man may live in vogueish Hoxton, but his heart resides just off the A3, and he showed the right spirit by admitting he'd worn a jumper \"because it looked like it was going to rain\". Same old Jarvis, then, the blip of This Is Hardcore now behind him. If new songs such as The Night Minnie Timperley Died sounded familiar, it's because Pulp have been smart enough not to diverge much from their tragicomic template. Common People got a minor electronic makeover but inevitably lapsed into an orgiastic singalong, while Sorted for Es and Whizz (played to easily the least stoned audience Pulp have ever encountered) remains the world's greatest song about listening to music in the middle of a field. All this and a pot of mint - what more could you want?"}, "isHosted": false}}}
