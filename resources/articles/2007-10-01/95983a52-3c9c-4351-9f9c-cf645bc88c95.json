Pity it's not the right kind of fear ...", "bodyText": "Dr Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College, knows what children need: more fear in their daily lives. They need to face physical hardship and personal deprivation, he told the New Culture Forum - a centre-right thinktank. Quite right, Doctor. It would be fabulous if they could all be footballing, all-night trekking, tree and mountain climbing, netballing and outward bounding, but we just don't have the space or the playing fields in towns, or any time in the curriculum, and whatever fearsome activities are still left to us have been foiled by health and safety regulations. Even conkers must be covered in bubble wrap before play. But don't worry. The modern urban child still has loads of fear in its daily life. It's just a different sort of fear. It still involves some of Seldon's requirements: risk, endurance and lack of comfort. Some of it is traditional - the sort that my friend Fielding experienced when he was a boy: the fear of getting your head stuffed down the toilet by bigger boys, and getting beaten up. Some of it is more 21st century. Fielding and I have spotted this type during our years at the chalkface. There's the fear of getting to school: leaving the home, dashing past the hooded gangs, knives and galloping pitbulls, then on to the buses and trains, crushed, sweating, stuck in jams, overwhelmed by the fear of bombs, or lateness and a bollocking from teacher and detention; then off the bus, dodging the happy-slappers, the horrid bigger boys/girls in the playground; then making it by the skin of your teeth to the classroom and sitting quaking at the cyber-bullies and all the other horrible things you've read about in the tabloids, which probably don't happen all that often, but might. And fear of Sats. At least this fear is free. Seldon's costs over \u00a325,000 a year for boarders at Wellington. But it's probably worth it. How we all long for the lovely, invigorating, fresh-air, challenging, better class of fear that he is advocating. But is that really fear? For most children it's excitement and adventure. What really frightened my friend Rosemary was her ghastly maths teacher. \"Until Rosemary stops snivelling in the back row I shall stop this class,\" he used to say. Poor Rosemary had already failed maths O-level five times. \"Oh the humiliation and the terror,\" she says. \"That was real fear. Don't talk to me about my schooldays. What are the virtues of fear? Is it meant to be character-building?\" Rosemary clearly hadn't experienced the sort of fear Seldon is after. But if we still can't fit the right sort of fear into the modern child's schooldays, he is prepared to contemplate the revival of call-up. Sometimes even I long for national service, to get those lazy little toads off the streets, into uniform, and slogging across harsh terrain in extremes of temperature, weighed down by tons of equipment and screamed at by sergeant majors in an adventurous and challenging way, but then I think of Deepcut barracks, and change my mind. So perhaps the thinktank ought to think again. Perhaps children don't really need more fear in their lives, but less, just more open space and less national curriculum - which Seldon's pupils probably have at Wellington. I was saddened by the story of Margaret Lymer and her daughter Eleanor Hamilton, who are to be fined \u00a330 for taking out eight dogs at once for a walkie. Five dogs belong to them, three belong to a disabled friend. These women are saints to help out a friend in need, but Kingsclere council in Hampshire rather foolishly regards them as a nuisance, because joggers say they have been bitten. Why trust a jogger? My dogs have been slandered by joggers, who falsely accused them of biting, when all they had done was have a look. And what's the bet that none of those council wallahs have even looked at this troupe on their walkies? Because if they had, they'd have seen that the best behaved dogs are in large packs with dog walkers. As I spend the bulk of my life walking dogs, I see this phenomenon daily. There are the professional dog walkers with their packs of eight to 10 dogs, all perfectly behaved, because a) they are carefully selected. No dog walker will take on a badly behaved dog. And b) according to that famous American dog-whisperer on telly, dogs learn to behave well by being in a pack. It is only inadequates like myself, who don't know what they're doing, who tend to have one or two renegade dogs. We have to go tagging along with the calm, effective mass dog-walkers to learn dog-control. I know. I do it twice a week. Yesterday was the Department of Work and Pensions Generation Xperience UK Older People's Day, another effort by our government to perk up the image of persons over 50. Again? How many more times? We are the new 30s and happier than ever before. We are fuelling a boom in the leisure market. We can even use email. Why bother to tell everybody? They won't believe it until they get there. Then some of them may have a good time and some of them won't, just like any other age, and even if they do, how long will it last? For some of us, 70 is the new 90, and 90 is usually fairly crap. My mother didn't like it. Meanwhile, I rather like 65. For now. This week Michele read When Did You Last See Your Father? by Blake Morrison: \"Loved it. Much too good to describe here in one line.\" She watched It's a Free World by Ken Loach: \"Gripping but depressing, with an outstanding cast, as usual, and new actor Kierston Wareing brilliant as the fledgling entrepreneur turning inevitably into a monster.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
