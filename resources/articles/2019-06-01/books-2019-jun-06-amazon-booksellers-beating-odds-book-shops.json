The bookshops Amazon couldn't kill", "bodyText": "Books and bookshops are on the up. Sales of printed books have risen for the fourth successive year; sales of ebooks are falling; and, perhaps most encouraging of all, despite two recent high-profile store closures, the number of independent bookshops is growing again after decades of decline. Books \u2013 and readers who want to experience bookshops, rather than buy from Amazon \u2013 are not dead. The physical world lives on. But what about booksellers? I\u2019ve spent the past few weeks talking to a number of them: some responded to a callout on the Guardian\u2019s website; others I approached directly. Most of the independents who responded are positive, although some are having to diversify to stay afloat. One has opened a tea room, while another I spoke to has closed her shop but plans to start selling children\u2019s books from a boat. A would-be bookseller in Olney, Buckinghamshire, has bought a bus and hopes to sell children\u2019s books from that. Shops are expensive to run, so bibliophiles are using their ingenuity. The chain booksellers I spoke to were far less positive about their working lives. Waterstones has been doing well in recent years under the stewardship of James Daunt, bucking the predictions of those who said Amazon would kill it off. But recent arguments over pay and conditions have cast a long shadow, with a petition from staff to management calling for the introduction of a living wage and an open letter from 1,300 authors backing them. Daunt, in response to the petition, said of his booksellers: \u201cWe reward them as well as we can with pay, but we mainly reward them with a stimulating job.\u201d Still against all odds \u2013 book prices that have barely gone up in 20 years; the war waged by Amazon; price-cutting by the supermarkets; the lure of mobile devices \u2013 books and bookshops are fighting back. As the high street crumbles and life becomes ever more depersonalised, we should surely celebrate their resilience. Rachael Rogan, 41, owner of Rogan\u2019s Books in Bedford Before she opened her bookshop in 2015, Rachael Rogan had never worked in books. She was a marketing executive specialising in preparing corporate bids for contracts. The turning point in her life came in her mid-30s when she was diagnosed with stage four cancer. \u201cI managed to beat it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it does leave you with an \u2018I\u2019m going to do something I really care about\u2019 attitude to life.\u201d She had two small children and decided the thing she really cared about was children\u2019s books. She launched a children\u2019s book festival and then, with the encouragement of members of the local community who pointed her to an empty shop space and pre-bought book vouchers to cash in once her shop was open, she took the plunge. \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful to see everybody come together and support it,\u201d she says. The rent is \u00a315,000 and that doesn\u2019t leave much for anything else. Rogan barely takes any salary \u2013 \u201cI have a very understanding husband,\u201d she says \u2013 and volunteers help her in the shop. This is bookshop as community service. \u201cBooks aren\u2019t an industry where you\u2019ve got a great profit margin,\u201d she says. You work 15-hour days and you don\u2019t get paid. It has to be a love. Rogan chooses books with her community in mind. \u201cI want every child to be able to walk in the shop and see themselves on the shelf \u2013 a child who is going through a family breakup, a child who has multiple sclerosis, a child who is autistic, a child who is going through some kind of gender identity issue \u2013 because it will make them feel included and it will make them feel like they\u2019re important. I would always do that over selling a million copies of the latest commercial hit.\u201d She says that locals send her emails with a link to Amazon asking her to order a book. When she tells them they could buy it cheaper if they ordered it themselves, she says they tell her: \u201cAmazon doesn\u2019t play with my kids; Amazon doesn\u2019t bring authors to Bedford; Amazon doesn\u2019t recommend books when my child is going through hell and needs something to lift them up.\u201d Julie Danskin, 30, manager of Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh Julie Danskin has been running Golden Hare Books for the past three years and says the store is \u201cone of the most rewarding, challenging and downright joyful experiences of my life. Together with a small team of booksellers and a dedicated owner we have grown our bookshop from a struggling business to a thriving one.\u201d When she took over the shop, she says, \u201cit was always very beautiful, but it felt like you weren\u2019t supposed to touch things and it didn\u2019t do that many events. We decided we needed to be a pillar of the community.\u201d The shop moved from a more touristy area to Stockbridge in the north of the city, which is populated by \u201clots of young families\u201d. Now, instead of relying on passing trade, it has been able to bed itself into a community. \u201cWe do a mixture of events in the bookshop,\u201d says Danskin, \u201cwhich have a very intimate, informal, sitting-room feel, and external events.\u201d The joy of bookselling, says Danskin, is making a connection with customers who may often be making a considerable emotional investment in the books they are buying. \u201cYou can really get to know people,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people come in and they are in incredibly vulnerable places in their life.\u201d Danskin worked at Waterstones for a year and rejects the argument that bookshops cannot pay a living wage. \u201cIf you\u2019re owned by a hedge fund [as Waterstones is], paying a living wage is likely to be the last of your priorities,\u201d she says. \u201cWe pay a living wage and are turning a profit. As far as I\u2019m concerned, if we don\u2019t have a good team that are being remunerated properly, then we are doing something terribly wrong.\u201d Ben Maddox, 25, bookseller at Waterstones in London Ben Maddox has worked for Waterstones for 18 months at two different branches \u2013 one in central London and one in the suburbs \u2013 but also filling in elsewhere as required. He works a 37-and-a-half-hour week, is expected to work weekends and bank holidays with no extra pay, and gets paid \u00a31,180 a month after tax. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit grating,\u201d he says, \u201cknowing you can earn more in other retail industries where you don\u2019t need any specialist knowledge, aren\u2019t expected to pull as many overtime hours and where there won\u2019t be huge events that require extra skills that won\u2019t have been part of your training.\u201d Maddox complains about the \u201cfaux friendliness\u201d of Waterstones. When he has been sent to cover in other stores at short notice, he says it was far from clear whether he could charge expenses for the extra travelling. He can \u2013 but he had to work that out for himself. \u201cIt is very vague,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes you feel as if you are the weird one for asking.\u201d He is keen to point out that it isn\u2019t all bad. \u201cDay to day, it can be tons of fun,\u201d he says. \u201cMore than a lot of other retail roles could be, because you\u2019ve got customers coming in who are interested in the things they are buying.\u201d But he doubts whether he will stay at Waterstones and hopes to make it as a screenwriter. \u201cEveryone has Waterstones has their \u2018slash\u2019,\u201d he says, \u201cthe other thing they love. You get a lot of writers, actors and artists.\u201d Joanna Chambers, 70, owner of Broadleaf Books in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire Secondhand bookshops have had a tough time over the past couple of decades as online suppliers have taken off, but Joanna Chambers\u2019s shop in the small south Wales town of Abergavenny is managing to stay afloat. What\u2019s the secret? \u201cI\u2019m not on the main street and my rent is fairly low,\u201d she explains. \u201cI pick all the books myself and they are not books you\u2019d see in the average shop. They may be secondhand, but they\u2019re not falling apart. I try to make the whole shop look a bit different from anywhere else.\u201d She sells books online, too, but the shop is her real joy, and she says customers appreciate it. \u201cThe shop does better than online. People love the look and smell of it.\u201d And the glorious serendipity, of course; the chance to find books you never knew you wanted. Chambers reckons she has more than 10,000 in stock, and buys most of them locally, often from the estates of people who have died. Chambers came to bookselling in her 50s. She got the bug when she helped a friend who had a book stall in Abergavenny. She then ran a bookshop as part of an unsuccessful experiment to turn nearby Blaenavon into a books town. That ended in miserable failure. \u201cI had to start again from scratch,\u201d she says. But seven years ago, she set up Broadleaf Books, and this time the formula has worked. \u201cI make enough money to keep the thing going,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be a bit bonkers to sell secondhand books. You have to have a passion.\u201d Chambers has no intention of giving up. \u201cI\u2019ll probably die in the chair,\u201d she says with a laugh. Khadija Osman, 24, manager of Round Table Books in Brixton, south London Round Table Books in Brixton Market has been open for less than a week when I visit. You can smell the newness. The bookshop is the sister company of publisher Knights Of, which produces titles with a focus on diversity and seeks to \u201copen windows into as many worlds as possible\u201d. Last year, Knights Of ran a pop-up bookshop in Brixton, and it proved so popular it hasturned it into a permanent store, supported by a crowdfunding campaign that raised \u00a330,000 and a grant of \u00a315,000 from Penguin Random House. The manager, Khadija Osman, graduated from university \u2013 she studied creative writing at Essex \u2013 last year. She has spent the previous six months working at Forbidden Planet \u2013 she is a fan of comic books and describes herself as a \u201cbig kid\u201d who loves material aimed at children \u2013 and says she has always wanted to run a bookshop. Osman, who grew up in a Somalian Muslim community in east London, says the shop will seek to champion writers from BAME backgrounds and stock a diverse range of books. It also plans to run storytelling events and writing workshops for local children. \u201cWe have to keep pushing the fact that it\u2019s a fun thing, not a box-ticking exercise,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a children\u2019s bookshop, first and foremost.\u201d Arlene Greene, 52, merchandiser for a branch of Tesco in Northern Ireland Arlene Greene has worked for Tesco in Northern Ireland for 14 years. She originally worked for an outside company that supplied books, CDs and DVDs to supermarkets, but that company has been sold several times \u2013 \u201cWe are a commodity apparently,\u201d she says \u2013 and now she is employed directly by Tesco. She sees herself as the store\u2019s \u201cbook lady\u201d and says she is one of an \u201carmy of minimum-wage workers, mostly middle-aged women\u201d who check stock and look after the book displays. Greene makes the point that Northern Ireland has very few independent bookshops; she says the emphasis has tended to be on secondhand books. That presents an opportunity to supermarkets, and she believes they are providing a worthwhile service. \u201cSupermarkets are affordable to the masses,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can be ruthless, but the fact that supermarkets sell books at least means the ordinary person on low pay can afford to buy a book when they want to. They\u2019re just the top sellers, but at least we are still getting kids\u2019 books out there at a reasonable price. That\u2019s the important part of the story.\u201d What the book ladies aren\u2019t allowed to do any longer is choose which books are sold. When the company was an independent supplier, they were given an input, but what to stock is now entirely a head-office decision, with the emphasis strictly on what will sell in large quantities. Greene finds this frustrating. \u201cWhen Milkman by Anna Burns came out, it would have been nice to have showcased a prize-winner that came from Belfast,\u201d she says. \u201cWe never received one copy. It wasn\u2019t seen as a big enough seller for our market.\u201d What she did get was endless copies of EL James. \u201cThey\u2019re rubbish,\u201d she says, \u201cabsolute rubbish, but I had to put it on every stand to get rid of it.\u201d Lesley Sheringham, 70, owns the independent bookshop Arthur Probsthain in central London The Arthur Probsthain bookshop was established by Lesley Sheringham\u2019s great-uncle in 1903. Based opposite the British Museum in central London and with a smaller outlet nearby at Soas University of London, it specialises in books on Asia, Africa and the Middle East. It is famous, much loved and in danger of going under \u2013 or perhaps morphing into something else \u2013 in the face of online competition. Sheringham has worked in the shop, which is still family owned, for 50 years. \u201cMost of the bookshops in this part of London have closed,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we\u2019re still hanging on. We had a very large stock of secondhand books built up over the years, but they are mostly sold on the internet now.\u201d They have reduced the stock held in the shop and opened a tea room instead. \u201cThe tea room is really supporting the bookshop now,\u201d she says. What Arthur Probsthain, who was a distinguished orientalist, would have made of it is a moot point. \u201cBookshops have to try different things, but it\u2019s been very tough,\u201d says Sheringham. \u201cIt\u2019s changed so much in the past 10 years. We don\u2019t get the shop trade any more. Old customers come in and say: \u2018What\u2019s happened to all your books?\u2019 But they haven\u2019t been here for 10 years.\u201d The museum is the building opposite is her point; this has to function as a shop. Trudy Elliott, 26, bookseller at Waterstones in north-west England Trudy Elliott has been at Waterstones for a year. It was her first job after graduating; she studied graphic design but realised she preferred books. \u201cEveryone who works there loves books,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re all very passionate about the industry and about sharing books we love.\u201d That\u2019s the upside, but there is a sizeable (or, rather, not very sizeable) downside \u2013 the pay. \u201cIt\u2019s very low paid,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve just been promoted to senior bookseller and I get \u00a38.70 an hour. If I get promoted again [to lead bookseller], I\u2019ll be on \u00a39.39. That\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at as a bookseller. After that you have to go into management. There\u2019s a mythical \u2018expert bookseller\u2019 level, but nobody seems to know what it is or what it\u2019s pegged at.\u201d She rounds on the argument of Waterstones\u2019 managing director Daunt that working for the company is inherently \u201cstimulating\u201d, as if that justifies the pay levels. \u201cHe was right when he called it stimulating,\u201d she says, \u201cbut, unfortunately, a stimulating job doesn\u2019t pay the rent.\u201d Elliott has other gripes, too. \u201cIt is exceptionally difficult to get a full-time position at Waterstones,\u201d she says; her contract is for 30 hours a week. \u201cThere are also problems with rota scheduling, taking annual leave and communication from head office to the shops. Waterstones expects full flexibility from staff, even those on 12-hour contracts who need to work other jobs to afford rent and bills. \u201cStaff morale at Waterstones is very low.\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a feeling that we are disposable to the company; it doesn\u2019t appreciate or invest in its staff. We are still fighting our cause, though, and are looking at unionising and getting a stronger collective voice.\u201d Nia Owen, 57, owner of Caban in Cardiff Nia Owen started her predominantly Welsh-language bookshop Caban in the trendy Portcanna area of Cardiff in 2002. She opened it primarily for her two sons, both of whom have autism. \u201cMy elder son [now 25] is quite able,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s very fond of books and because of his autism he\u2019s very organised. His headmistress, in a passing comment, said to me: \u2018He should work in a library or a bookshop.\u2019\u201d So Owen decided to provide him with that opportunity, giving up her job as a neuro-physiotherapist. She says it cost her \u00a310,000 to get started and that she got the shop off the ground in six weeks. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have many books,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much of anything. But we had goodwill. We sort of played shop, and I think that has worked. People come in, they\u2019re very loyal, they\u2019re very regular and if they haven\u2019t got any money I tell them to take something and pay next time they\u2019re coming past.\u201d Owen, who grew up in a Welsh-speaking family in North Wales, sells Welsh-language books and English-language books with a Welsh connection. She has some paid helpers and other volunteers. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a co-operative,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause everybody wants it to succeed. People come in sometimes just to talk. They tell us everything. I think we\u2019ve replaced vicars and doctors.\u201d Gareth Thomas, 40, secondhand bookseller who has a stall beneath Waterloo Bridge in London Gareth Thomas has been selling secondhand books as part of the Southbank Centre Book Market for 15 years. He started helping out on a stall when he was still at university, where he studied music technology, then took over one of the pitches \u2013 there are nine stallholders in all \u2013 when a licence became available. He is quietly sitting next to his stall \u2013 long trestle tables covered in books and comics \u2013 when I arrive, while a couple of prospective buyers idly flick through his offerings. It is a blustery Tuesday and only the hardiest three of the nine stallholders have arrived to set up. Some of the others only appear at weekends \u2013 the busiest days \u2013 or on weekdays in the summer, when the riverside pavements are thronged. Thomas pays the Southbank Centre \u00a33,500 for his licence and targets a turnover of \u00a340,000. His bestsellers are Penguin first editions \u2013 all neatly wrapped in plastic wrappers \u2013 and ancient hardback novels that he says appeal to tourists. He also has a sideline in US comics and yellowing copies of the Beano. \u201cI try to get stuff you\u2019re not likely to find in charity shops,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you just have lots of copies of Dan Brown or chic-lit, people say: \u2018I can buy that for a pound in a charity shop. Why should I pay \u00a33 down here?\u2019\u201d I ask if he always intended to devote his time to selling secondhand books while gazing at the Thames. \u201cNo,\u201d he admits. \u201cI had my sights set on being a famous music producer when I left university and this was just a stopgap.\u201d But he says it suits him. While it can be \u201ca bit hand to mouth, except in the summer\u201d, he\u2019s his own boss; he can turn up when he feels like \u2013 he recently became a father and has enjoyed having time to spend with his son - and his overheads are low. . Robert Kane, 30, runs a \u2018book bar\u2019 at a fringe theatre in Belfast Robert Kane is an actor and musician who works for Accidental Theatre in Belfast. As with most in fringe theatre, he has to multitask: not just performing but fixing lights, props, toilets, everything. But there is one extracurricular part of the job that, as a keen reader, he loves: helping to run the theatre\u2019s book bar. The book bar was born of a passion for booze rather than literature. In its original premises, Accidental didn\u2019t have a licence to sell alcohol, so customers had to buy a book to get a complimentary drink. It does now have a licence for some of its shows, but the tradition continues. To get an alcoholic drink you have to become an instant book lover. Kane admits the system initially baffles some theatregoers, but most quickly grasp it and even start to enjoy it. \u201cIt\u2019s magical,\u201d he says. \u201cThe book buying has taken on a life of its own. People end up spending more time looking for a book than talking to the people they\u2019ve come to the theatre with.\u201d He reckons about 80% of customers keep the books they have chosen; the other 20%, more interested in the booze than the bard, leave them to be recycled. \u201cIt\u2019s very seldom that people are only interested in the drink and take the first thing that comes to hand,\u201d he says. \u201cMost look for something they really want.\u201d Some get so immersed in choosing a book that they don\u2019t leave time to collect the drink. \u201cSometimes, the five-minute bell sounds and they\u2019re still looking,\u201d he says. They are allowed to pick a provisional book, get their drink and come back later to continue their search. Kane thinks the slightly bizarre convention is perfect for a fringe theatre. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s playful and sets us apart from other venues, addressing the fact that we are fringe and slightly absurdist.\u201d The theatre\u2019s patrons donate books and a couple of local bookshops also give it books they no longer want. \u201cWhat is on our shelves is a game of roulette,\u201d says Kane, \u201cas our selection is entirely based on what is donated.\u201d The bar has about 800 books, which are constantly refreshed, rather like the audience.
