The 68-year-old veteran of the banking world is the father of Nat Rothschild, the head of the US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital, which has emerged alongside the Children's Investment fund (TCI) at the head of opposition to Deutsche B\u00f6rse's plan. Atticus holds about a 5% stake in Deutsche B\u00f6rse, while TCI holds about 7.5%. The rebels are planning to try to oust the supervisory board of the German exchange as well as the chairman, Rolf Breuer, and the chief executive, Werner Seifert. They want to halt any bid in favour of the return of almost \u00a3350m of cash to shareholders. At the weekend it emerged that Reto Francioni, a former colleague of Mr Seifert's who now heads the Swiss stock exchange, is the rebel's preferred candidate for the chief executive post if their plan succeeds. Opposition to Deutsche B\u00f6rse making a full offer for the LSE appears to be mounting. Merrill Lynch's investment arm, which holds about a 3% stake, has joined a growing list of dissenting Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders in voicing its opposition to a deal. Shareholders accounting for roughly 38% of Deutsche B\u00f6rse have so far expressed concerns about any LSE takeover. The company's own advisers, however, point out that its long-term German shareholders are more supportive of the two exchanges merging. A spokesman for Deutsche B\u00f6rse was sanguine about the nomination of Lord Rothschild, saying only \"we just note this as yet another development\". Deutsche B\u00f6rse does not seem to be bowed by the rising objection to its plans. The company is waiting for the Office of Fair Trading to decide whether or not to call for a competition inquiry into any proposed deal, before revising its indicative 530p per share, \u00a31.35bn offer. The OFT's decision is expected next month. Euronext, the European exchange and potential rival bidder, is also biding its time before making any formal offer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
