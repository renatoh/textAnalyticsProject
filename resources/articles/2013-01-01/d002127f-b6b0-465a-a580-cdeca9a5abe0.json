Michael McGoldrick is a celebrated multi-instrumentalist who has worked with everyone from Kate Rusby to the Transatlantic Sessions, and is one of a dozen musicians providing the backing here. He carefully ensures that Sweeney still dominates with her light, fluid and often swooping fiddle work. For much of the set, she segues between traditional jigs, reels and sturdy tunes written by herself or McGoldrick, but there are surprises, from a West Virginia lament to a bluegrass waltz, an Indian-influenced mood piece and a delicate treatment of Nick Drake's A Place to Be featuring Sweeney's suitably fragile vocals. A gently classy debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
