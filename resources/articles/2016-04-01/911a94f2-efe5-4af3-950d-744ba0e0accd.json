Currently 1.1 million children in the UK are being treated for asthma. But a growing body of international research suggests that many children diagnosed with asthma do not actually have the condition, raising concerns about the impact of unnecessary treatments. In a leading article published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, Professor Andrew Bush and Dr Louise Fleming of Imperial College, London, argue that overdiagnosis of asthma is exposing patients to the potentially harmful side effects of medications they do not need, including growth suppression and a higher risk of respiratory infections. They write: \u201cIs there any other chronic disease in the world in which children are committed to potentially hazardous, long-term therapy without every effort being made objectively to document the diagnosis?\u201d What\u2019s more, they argue, overdiagnosis is costly and risks trivialising the condition, with inhalers now \u201calmost a fashion accessory.\u201d \u201cAsthma is a killing disease and it needs to be taken seriously,\u201d Bush told the Guardian. It is an issue of growing concern. In January 2015 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) warned that up to 30% of adults diagnosed as having asthma may not have the condition, while earlier this year a Dutch study from Julius Healthcare Centers and University Medical Center Utrecht, found that more than half of a group of 652 children had been diagnosed as having asthma when it was unlikely that they had the condition. Bush believes the need for doctors to use objective tests to confirm diagnoses, often based on symptoms such as wheezing, is urgent. \u201cIt is a case of attitudes of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that is going to cause the health service to have to spend millions - it will probably save resources if inhalers weren\u2019t given to those who didn\u2019t need them.\u201d Nice is attempting to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and monitoring of the condition. The draft guidelines clearly instruct doctors not to \u201cuse symptoms alone without an objective test to diagnose asthma,\u201d with measurements of airflow obstruction and airway inflammation among the tests advised for adults and young people. Two of these tests, quality-assured spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, are currently being field-tested by Nice. \u201cAccurate diagnosis of asthma has been a significant problem which means that people may be wrongly diagnosed or cases might be missed in others,\u201d said Professor Mark Baker, director of clinical practice at Nice. \u201cWe are in the process of developing a guideline that will give clarity and set out the most clinical and cost-effective ways to diagnose and monitor asthma in children, young people and adults. Some of the recommendations are now being trialled in primary care to provide evidence on whether or not the guideline can be introduced into the NHS effectively and efficiently.\u201d It\u2019s a move welcomed by Bush. \u201cWhat they are trying to do is to say if you make a diagnosis of asthma, you should make every effort to back this up with simple objective tests,\u201d he said. But Bush and Fleming believe Nice could go further, arguing that children under the age of five should also be diagnosed on the basis of objective tests, and that more robust therapeutic trials are needed. Moreover, they point out, many children outgrow symptoms of asthma. \u201cNo matter who as made the diagnosis, always consider whether it was actually correct in the first place, or whether it is still relevant,\u201d they write. But Bush is also quick to warn that patients should not consider abandoning their inhalers. \u201cIf you have asthma these are life-saving, fantastic medications, and if you have asthma it is really important that you take them.\u201d Commenting on the article, Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at Asthma UK, said: \u201cThis illustrates the challenges that GPs face every day, because there currently isn\u2019t one definitive way of easily diagnosing asthma. It\u2019s astonishing in the 21st century that there isn\u2019t a test your child can take to tell if they definitely have asthma.\u201d The problems, she added, are complex. \u201cAsthma isn\u2019t one condition but many, with different causes and triggered by different things at different ages. Asthma symptoms also change throughout someone\u2019s life or even week by week and day by day. This complexity means that it is both over and underdiagnosed, in children and in adults, so people don\u2019t get the care they need to manage their asthma effectively. We urgently need more investment in asthma research to get to a definitive test to ensure people get the right diagnosis.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
