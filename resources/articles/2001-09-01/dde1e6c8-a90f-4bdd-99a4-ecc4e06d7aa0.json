He was also associated with two of America's most popular comedy series. He became a writer on the sitcom Cheers, about the regulars who drank in a Boston pub, which ran from 1982 to 1993. Then, he was the creator and executive producer, alongside partners Peter Casey and David Lee, of the outstanding series, Frasier, about a dysfunctional Seattle radio psychiatrist. Frasier, which was first broadcast in 1993 and is still running, evolved when the producers of Cheers approached Angell and his two partners to write a spin-off series about a character from Cheers, the psychiatrist Frasier Crane. It became a huge success, although Angell had known it was a gamble. \"The track records on spin-offs are all terrible,\" he said later, \"so we were fearful.\" Angell, who died on his way to Los Angeles for the now postponed Emmy awards ceremonies, won an unprecedented number of Emmies. With his two partners in Grub Street Productions, the company they had founded in 1985, Angell won his record-breaking fifth consecutive Emmy for an outstanding comedy series in the 1997-98 Frasier. Other hit comedies, Hill Street Blues, LA Law and Cheers, had all won four consecutive Emmies. When, in 1997, he went up to collect the award, he said: \"On my way up here I heard somebody say: \"Oh God! Not them again!'\" It was decided to set Frasier in Seattle because it was just about as far away from Boston as possible - so none of the other characters could drop in on a visit. Frasier, played by Kelsey Grammer, the uptight, pompous radio psychiatrist, is pitched against his brother Niles, also a psychiatrist. The series was tended lovingly by Angell, his partners and team of writers, forging a series that melded a traditional sitcom with a surreal edge. There were some classic gags. In the first series, Frasier tells his radio audience: \"Six months ago I was living in Boston. My wife had left me, which was very painful, then she came back to me, which was excruciating.\" The Guardian's critic Nancy Banks-Smith alluded to its style in 1994 when she described one episode in which \"a critic had simply written [of Frasier] - and one admires the sinewy economy of his style - 'I hate Frasier Crane.' Frasier responded in spades. 'What trenchant criticism! Move aside Voltaire!'\" Frasier picked up an award in its first season: an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. And there were many more to come. Angell also won a Golden Globe, the critics' award, and the prestigious Peabody broadcasting prize, and with his partners amassed 37 Emmy nominations and 24 Emmy awards. In 1990, before Frasier, Grub Street Productions had produced another hit comedy series, Wings, which lasted until 1997. It was set at the waiting room and lunch counter of a small airport near Boston, and the jokes and joshing among the \"gang\" in the show was like Cheers in pilots' leather jackets. It, too, brought good ratings to NBC, the network Angell always worked for. A much later new show, Encore! Encore!, based on the story of an opera singer who has lost his voice and returns to his family's Californian vineyard, was not, however, a winner. Grub Street Productions disbanded in 1999 after Lee moved on; Angell and Casey began working on film projects. Success for Angell, however, had not come easily - or quickly. He had moved to LA from Boston in 1977 and very soon sold his first script to the producers of the forgotten Annie Flynn series. Five years then passed, during which he did dozens of temporary jobs, before sellinganother script to the top hit show, Archie Bunker's Place, about a prejudiced working-class oaf, borrowed from the British series, Till Death Us Do Part. Then in 1983 he joined the Cheers team as a staff writer. He was born in the small town of West Barrington, Rhode Island, and after high school attended Providence College, a Roman Catholic university in the state which was founded by Dominicans. He graduated in English literature. Angell was a lifelong devout Catholic, although he did not parade it before his Hollywood friends. After graduation he joined the US army and served at the Pentagon until 1972. He then moved to Boston and worked as a methods analyst at an engineering company and then at an insurance firm in Rhode Island. But he always wanted to write, and finally uprooted himself and moved to Hollywood. Angell was killed with his wife Lynn, a volunteer librarian in a home for abused children. They were building a holiday home in Cape Cod. Angell's brother Kenneth was a Catholic bishop in Vermont. \u0095 David Angell, television comedy writer, born 1947; died September 11 2001."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
