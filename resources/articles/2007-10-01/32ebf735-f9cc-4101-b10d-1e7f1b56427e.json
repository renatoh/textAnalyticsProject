The children's secretary was reiterating what Gordon Brown had said in his first conference speech as prime minister the day before: that every child in England will have dedicated time every week with a personal tutor. \"If you want world-class education for all, it is personalised one-to-one help throughout their school life that can make the difference,\" said Balls. And his department is putting its money where its mouth is by spending pounds 144m over three years to help struggling primary school children reach the accepted minimum standard in reading, writing and arithmetic by the age of 11. After all, the government has missed its target of 85% of pupils reaching level 4 in English thanks mainly to poor results in writing. That is why the Every Child a Reader programme is soon to be joined by Every Child a Writer, promised Balls. These schemes will provide intensive support and one-to-one tuition to those falling behind, \"So that every child can leave primary school with the three Rs,\" added Balls. One-to-one tutoring is part of \"personalised learning\" - something, Brown told conference-goers, that would be \"available to all, not one-size-fits-all, but responding to individual needs\". To some in the teaching profession, that sounds like the educational clone of the NHS patients' charter: fine in sentiment, but prickly in practice. Teachers sceptical \"When I hear these things from the government, I tend to take them with a pinch of salt, because much of what they say never happens or is rubbish,\" says Sarah Every (not her real name), an English teacher at a secondary school in Greater Manchester. Every has first-hand experience of providing one-to-one tutoring as she manages her school's key stage 3 intervention - \"which is basically personal tuition\". Teachers are sceptical about the seriousness of the government in rolling out personal tuition across the board. After all, the policy is a little wishy-washy when it comes down to extra money, who will do the tutoring and how it will fit within what the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) research last week suggested is the most proscribed national curriculum in Europe. Yet John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), says the foundations are there to make it achievable. \"Most secondary schools have a good system of personal tutoring, in which the old-style pastoral tutor is now playing a full role in the academic development of the child, helping with target-setting and focusing on studies,\" he says. \"That is how most schools will want to put this into action.\" Except in a couple of cases, one-to-one tutoring has \"never been on the agenda\" at Cator Park school in London, where Oliver Taylor teaches science, but the increase in support staff makes it feasible. \"For basic literacy and numeracy in years 7 and 8, in my school, you are talking about 10 students in year 7 needing such one-to-ones. Ten students for an hour each week is doable.\" If the government is serious about maximising the educational benefit of personal tutoring, then it should also target the middle ground. \"Students whose work has plateaued are sometimes ignored,\" says Every. \"They need attention too and perhaps a bit more of a push. One-to-one would help.\" Who is going to provide this extra tuition could be a bone of contention. Ed Balls suggests teaching assistants, of whom there are now more than 120,000 in English secondary schools, could be involved. And so they should and already are, says ASCL's John Dunford: \"One-to-one tutoring does not always need to be done by qualified teachers.\" Yet this worries Every, who points to the policy allowing support staff to invigilate exams. \"The kids see the teaching assistant as a helper so they play up,\" she says. \"Instead of having an exam atmosphere, it is an atmosphere of chaos.\" Personal tuition is only part of personalised learning, the pros and cons of which schools including Monkseaton in Whitley Bay are discovering. Students, as well as teachers, are involved in accessing their educational needs through computerised self-assessment. Also class material and lesson notes are available when and wherever they want, via the IT system. \"All that means is you can identify particular needs and try to address them,\" says Paul Kelley, the headteacher. \"But it doesn't work unless you have the answer to the question, and one-to-one tutoring can't provide that except in small bits.\" Hazy ideas If the government's vision for personalised learning is rather hazy, equally unclear is how state schools will find space in the week for the five hours of sport and the extra time Brown and Balls want spent on the arts and music. Of course, teachers recognise the need for more creative time and physical education. But this is a tall deal considering that 10,000 or more playing fields were sold off under the Conservatives between 1979 and 1997, that the school timetable is already crammed and that teachers are under huge pressure to meet standards. Many find that there simply isn't enough grass to exercise on or hours in the day. \"We have to prioritise,\" says Every. \"For example, year 8 in my school are going to be taken out of their Friday morning lessons, such as French, in order to do more reading. This is because they can't access the language curriculum properly if they can't access basic literacy.\" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority recommends that English, maths and science account for at least three hours each a week at key stage 3, and many schools, including Taylor's, devote five hours to each, which already leaves less time for all the other subjects. \"You would have to take one hour away from each of the core subjects to fulfil the five hours of sport target,\" Taylor says. That is something the government of Balls's 3Rs would never allow. Clearly Balls is not talking solely about the timetable curriculum. \"We have to be clear here - lined up with this is the extended schools policy and that is not at all clear at the moment,\" says Dunford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
