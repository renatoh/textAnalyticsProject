Unfortunately, prejudices still exist within football. Fifa is working hard to tackle them.\" 2) Gordon Taylor \u2013 who defended his PFA members in 2010 for refusing to take part in an anti-homophobia campaign video because: \"It would be unfair to ask individuals to back a campaign like this in case they got targeted by crowds. It's a macho environment.\" 3) The Sun \u2013 worried it would still take \"almost superhuman bravery\" for a current player to follow Hitzlsperger's lead due to the threat of jibes from a \"moronic minority\". \u2022 2011: The Sun on the Beckhams inviting Louis Spence to their party: \"Bender it like Beckham\". New year honours: best message Sepp: starting 2014 with a call for more transparency in football, and with legal action to ban a cartoon book about his life at Fifa. Lawyers, who won a temporary injunction last month, say the cartoons would destroy their client's \"good reputation\". The case is in court this week. Best fresh starts 1) South American confederation Conmebol: ready to fight the year's first allegations of \"corrupt financial management\" after top Uruguayan clubs combined to sue them. 2) African confederation Caf welcoming back old faces for a gala night, including Nigerian ex-executive Amos Adamu, back from a three-year bribery ban, and Benin's Anjorin Moucharafou, back from two spells on remand denying embezzlement. Best new year gong A CBE for Karren Brady \u2013 who backed public sector spending cuts at September's Tory conference due to Labour \"all but bankrupting the country\", six months after securing \u00a3150m of public money to refit West Ham's new ground. Best leadership Bolton chairman Phil Gartside: committing to lead the club to a new \"self-sustainable future\" and end over-reliance on benefactor Eddie Davies's \u00a3151m loans. \u2022 Gartside's previous best vision: 2001, with the club \u00a330m in debt: \"One of our directors, Eddie Davies, has loaned the club \u00a32m and given us tremendous support. Eddie is a Farnworth lad and a lifelong Wanderers' fan who now lives in the Isle of Man and he has put more money into Bolton Wanderers than any other person in the history of the club. But we can't constantly rely on that sort of generosity. We have to run the business properly.\" Plus: best resolution 11 Dec: Bologna president Albano Guaraldi, denying that fan pressure to start the new year by sacking coach Stefano Pioli was getting to him. \"I deny all such speculation. Pioli is of great value to us. Maybe he'll even have a contract extension.\" 7 Jan: Maybe he won't.

Claim of the week Paraguay: Olympia player Sebasti\u00e1n Ariosa, alleging his club sacked him by telegram for having cancer. \"This was not the time nor the way to do it. Doctors say I'll play again.\" Paraguay's PFA say the move was \"inhumane\"; Olympia say Ariosa is \"simply suspended during the healing process\". Best perspective Brazil: Marilia coach Luis dos Reis, looking for the positives after a friendly against Tup\u00e3 was abandoned over a \"kung-fu style\" brawl. \"We regret it, but it hardly matters. Games such as this are good for rapport. I'm a satisfied coach.\" Most upbeat Ghana: Prophet Kweku Mensah Otabil, \"relaxed\" over reports he faces arrest on allegations that he tried to extract $20,000 from Ghana's FA in return for not cursing their World Cup campaign. \"What, police want to arrest me? Ghana police? I am not bothered at all.\" Movie news Brazil: Clayton Nunes, director of 2014 World Cup-themed porn film Copa do Sexo, on the creative challenge. \"We're banned from using official products or logos, or lookalikes. It is so hard to avoid Fifa's attention.\" Best pitch invasion Portugal: Braga fan Maria Am\u00e9lia da Silva Morais, 77, on why she invaded Mar\u00edtimo's pitch last month: \"I behaved badly, but I'll always fight for Braga. I'm a woman with no parents, no husband, no children: my loves are Braga and the church. I've never missed a game, and I never will \u2013 even if I'm ill I just take a blanket. Only a stroke could stop me. You know what I'm made of? I am made of iron.\" Plus: love news Turkey: Kayserispor's Pablo Mouche, denying links with model Vicky Xipolitakis after leaving model Vitto Saravia. Xipolitakis says she's staying focused this year. \"I'm only eyeing ugly men who amuse me. Why should I seek out beauties? I'm the beauty here.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
