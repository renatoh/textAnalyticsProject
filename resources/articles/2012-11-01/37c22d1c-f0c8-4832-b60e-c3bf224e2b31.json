Do not read on if you haven't seen episodes three and four \u2013 and please do not post spoilers if you've seen further into the series Catch up on the episodes one and two blog Toast! Bring me toast! And sushi! It's apparently hungry work on the campaign trail, although I can't help feeling that Kamper should be eating some vegetables rather than just various warm bread products. Admittedly, it could be worse: he could have fallen for Denmark's hotdog obsession. (Mmmm \u2026 P\u00f8lser). Anyway, enough drooling. There's a great deal to get through this evening \u2013 not least because, according to the kidnapper's speedy timetable, we're now moving into the endgame with the Zeuthens and their kidnapped daughter. It remains to be seen quite how that will tie in with a television schedule that means we have six more hours of this series to come. Your thoughts, please, below. The investigation: what do we know \u2022 The debt the kidnapper wants repaying is not monetary. He is motivated by the case of 13-year-old Louise Jelby, an orphan presumed to have killed herself. \u2022 Jelby was found in a West Jutland harbour by the three seamen on the Medea; the rope from the heavy concrete block she was tied to was stuck in the propeller of the boat they were then serving on. \u2022 Both the investigator and the pathologist said they were leaned on by the deputy public prosecutor to support a verdict of suicide, despite signs of murder and possible sexual abuse. \u2022 All three are now dead; along with the three seamen. \u2022 Victor Macijevski turned up unannounced to see Peter Schultz. The deputy public prosecutor said it was about witness expenses; his secretary said Macijevski wanted to change his statement because of his conscience. \u2022 A month after the case was closed, a man, Danish, 40ish, asked the investigator to reopen it. He had been working on a drilling platform (hence the time lapse). \u2022 It's unclear whether Schultz had contact with the justice minister, Mogens Rank. Rank spoke at a professional meeting Shultz attended, but PET say there was no contact. Schultz attended a ministry of justice event, but Mogens was apparently not there. \u2022 Mogens was friends with Robert Zeuthen's father and went hunting and sailing with him. \u2022 Before the kidnap, the ministry of justice and PET were sent the Bill of Indictment - an anti-capitalist dossier that contained various threats. It was emailed from the Medea. \u2022 The kidnapper's most recent \u2013 and he says final \u2013 demand is an exchange of Robert Zeuthen for his daughter. \u2022 Emilie appears to be being held by someone who knows her well. \u2022 Juncker found where Emilie has been being held, thanks to her signals (window writing + lightswitch). Will the kidnapper return to the same spot? The police I thought for a moment that Borch was going to be Lund's latest dead partner, following the pair's chase round the almost comically creepy pathology building, last tiled in about 1970, where the lighting is specially arranged to create large pools of shadow. (At one point, I almost expected the kidnapper to get up off a trolley and blunder his way over to Lund in the manner of the undead.) Instead, Lund faltered: unable to shoot the kidnapper in case he, in turn, shot Borch \u2013 much to the fury of everyone else, who has presumably forgetten that her recent close colleagues are now deceased. While I have no desire to see Lund \"saved\" by true love \u2013 if Forbrydelsen III goes all Sex and the City at the end, I'll be furious \u2013 both writing and acting as Lund tried to vocalise why she couldn't shoot were beautifully done: \"You were in the way.\" In any case, Lund is having to deal with more than a couple of stressful situations: not least working with a man she jilted if not at the altar, then certainly at the doorstep. But she is trying \u2013 I particularly liked the way she interpreted Borch's suggestion that she should take \"a gift\" when she visited Mark and Eva, as take \"a pizza\". Admittedly, Lund almost sent Eva into labour, but she let her stay without a second's thought. Mark, meanwhile, forever moaning about his mother's selfishness, turned up unannounced at her office, was rude to her, and then flounced off when she had to take a call that might save a child's life. Hmm. I felt quite sad for Lund when Eva told her: \"Mark was so happy. He said he wanted a family because he'd never had one and he didn't want to end up like you.\" And again when Mark told her he'd \"fucked it up, just like you\". Although I suspect they are more similar than he would like to admit: I laughed at Eva's description of Mark's mind \"being elsewhere\"; two minutes later Lund was absorbed in her paperwork. Back on duty, dear Juncker remains a step behind the kidnapper, but those steps are getting tinier and tinier. Brix, as is usual, seems to be fluctuating wildly between believing 100% in Lund (questioning the investigator, being persuaded into taking Robert Zeuthen) and not backing her at all (taking the phone off her). But then Sarah does do bonkers things, such as abandon a cash handover in favour of a hunch about the pathologist. Even if she does turn out to be right. The politicians The police have yet to start grappling with the question: on whose orders was Schulz working, and to what end. But it looks likely that when they do, they'll have at least a sniff around the justice minister, Rank, who has been expertly styled as a thoroughly bad piece of work. So bad, in fact, that Kamper has made it clear he'll fire him post-election. Personally, I wouldn't have thought firing someone in advance a particularly smart choice, but then Kristian presumably knows what he's doing/ has locked all his files and destroyed all incriminating evidence. In any case, after the slightly unfathomable political finale to last weeks' episodes, we now have our political mystery established: somebody has been protecting the murderer of Louise Jelby, and somebody else has been leaking about that protection. That second someone may be Jens Lebech, ex-husband of Rosa, who has asked Kamper for what might be the most awkward meeting in history: \"You might be shagging my ex, but your whole government is rotten to the core.\" I can't wait. Further to my comment of last week: Karen may not be boffing Kamper, but, according to Stoffer, she has been in love with him for some time. (If it wasn't for the finance minister, I might wonder whether all the female characters around the prime minister in this series weren't there just for romantic intrigue.) Kamper's family life remains opaque. We seem to be being led to believe that his son died or disappeared, and that there are parallels with Emilie, which is why he is so involved with the case. Certainly there's something there: not only has he shut up the family home, but it is notable that he keeps his brother so close. The Family and Firm First let's talk about Reinhardt. His loyalty to Robert makes me oddly suspicious: conniving with him so Robert could leave for the police station, shutting the doors on Carsten, telling his boss what he wanted to hear when it came to Maja. Robert trusts him absolutely \u2013 in fact, there seems to be no one else. I wonder if Robert's father also trusted Reinhardt absolutely and he knows family secrets that predate Robert's time on the throne? Could they be at the bottom of this debt? Certainly Reinhardt doesn't seem to be digging into affairs very quickly or very thoroughly, despite the urgency of the case. I fear he knows something unsavoury. Those shots of Robert \u2013 face composed, blank, suit neatly buttoned despite being covered with mud \u2013 put him in stark contrast with Maja, panicky and fraught as she realises the hunt is getting ever more desperate. And yet it's Robert who runs from the car and towards the campervan, ready to take on whatever he might meet, and Robert who puts himself into the car for the kidnapper's evil exchange. Notable, too, that he sent the US hostage-negotiators away and prepared to hand over as much cash as was necessary. But for all that, he seems strangely ineffectual when it comes to examining his own company for clues as to who has taken Emilie. Notes and observations \u2022 There were many echoes of The Bridge this evening, I thought: particularly in terms of the pathologist's death, and the Bill of Indictment. \u2022 Odd that a courthouse would have so little CCTV. \u2022 Interesting discussions on last week's blog about Medea \u2013 and how the ship's name might have a larger significance. If so, I'm not quite sure how, but your interpretations very welcome. \u2022 \"Congratulations.\" It takes Lund a lot of awkward conversation before she finds the right words for Eva and Mark. \u2022 The flat heels and proper jumper were back on show this week. Lund has dug out her alternative police uniform. \u2022 It took me a minute or two to realise the negotiators were speaking English, and I wasn't understanding via the medium of subtitles. \u2022 Would the British government be so happy for the payment of a massive ransom to a kidnapper I wonder? They were up to over \u00a310m. \u2022 More references to the financial crisis this week with evictees living on campsites, and \"Mudtown\". \u2022 Anyone else have a moment of BBC4 crime drama confusion with a reference to \"that redheaded lawyer\"? Although frankly, Josephine would make mincemeat of everyone here. \u2022 In the comments last week @Kariebookish gave us some nice Danish context for the Kristian/Rosa relationship. \"Poul Nyrup Rasmussen - PM in the 1990s - ended up marrying the leader of the coalition party. He serenaded her live on TV.\" \u2022 @TheNorthRemembers gave us a link to a Radio 4 podcast about the Oresund bridge joining Denmark and Sweden. \u2022 @Gubl4kii spotted that Lund is still driving \"the same old Ford Focus car ZP 26 127!\" \u2022 And I suppose this was inevitable: (via @HenrikD, @roseutd) \u2022 We're going to be leaving comments open for a month, rather than a week, which I hope helps those watching on catch-up.
