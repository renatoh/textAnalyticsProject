Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbekistan national, appears to have been inspired by violent Isis videos depicting beheadings and shootings, according to prosecutors. He allegedly left behind a note in the truck used in the attack that suggested support of Isis. On Wednesday afternoon, the FBI briefly announced it was looking to question a second Uzbek man, but withdrew the bulletin shortly after, saying they had found him. Officials confirmed that Saipov had entered the US in 2010 through the diversity visa program, also known as the green card lottery. Donald Trump has called for the program to be eliminated \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Investigators said Saipov picked Halloween for the attack on a bike lane because he knew more people would be out on the streets. It was the deadliest terrorist act in New York City since 9/11. Eight people were killed and 11 others, including two children, were seriously injured. Five Argentinian friends on holiday in Manhattan are among the dead. The Belgian who was killed was identified as Ann-Laure Decadt, 31, the mother of a three-year-old and a three-month-old son, who had traveled with her relatives to New York from a rural town in Belgium. Her husband and children had not traveled with her. The only New Yorker killed in the attack was 23-year-old Nicholas Cleves, a software engineer and web developer who lived in Manhattan. The other American killed was 32-year-old Darren Drake, who grew up in new Milford, New Jersey, his father said. Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cWe must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!\u201d He later tweeted \u201cthoughts, condolences and prayers\u201d. Law enforcement officials have told reporters that as the suspect got out of the truck, he was heard yelling \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d, the Arabic phrase for \u201cGod is great\u201d. The suspect, who was carrying a paintball gun and a pellet gun, was shot in the stomach by a New York police department officer, but survived. On Tuesday, Governor Andrew Cuomo called it a \u201clone wolf\u201d attack, and authorities said there was no ongoing threat or evidence of a wider plot. The attack occurred a few blocks from the new World Trade Center building at the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack in 2001. The incident happened near Stuyvesant high school, a prestigious Manhattan public school. The vehicle involved in the attack was a Home Depot rental truck. The vehicle also hit a school bus, injuring two adults and two children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
