Well-scrubbed child: \"What Lassie? Granny has fallen down the mine shaft again? We'd better get help!\" Scene 2 Lassie in phone box dials 999. Well-scrubbed police officer: Hi Lassie. Granny in the mine shaft? We'll be right there. Scene 3 Enter Lassie with Granny in mouth. All pat Lassie. Lassie, the world's favourite collie, is coming panting back, more than 60 years after she (although she was usually a he) made her screen debut. The latest canine stars (there are three of them) are not part of the dynasty that began in 1945 when Elizabeth Taylor co-starred in Lassie Come Home. But the plot will be the same because the new movie, costing \u00a36.9m and due out at Christmas, will be a remake of the original movie. On the eve of the second world war, the Carraclough family, who live in a Yorkshire mining town, fall on hard times and are forced to sell their dog to the Duke of Rudling. Lassie bunks out of the duke's Scottish castle and heads for home. For the usual movie business reason (money), a film set in England and Scotland is being made in Ireland and on the Isle of Man. Not everyone is delighted. Colliewoode Productions, formed by two American Lassie lovers who believe in the purity of the ancestral line, say it is deeply saddened that a \"line dog\" will not be featured in a major film \"for the first time in Lassie history\". \"The three dogs who play Lassie come from America and they had to be put into quarantine six months in advance of filming,\" said Ed Guiney, the producer. The male dogs - Carter, Mason and Dakota - all about two years old, are trained on set by the company Birds And Animals, which also worked on the Harry Potter films. They will be working with Peter O'Toole, who plays the Duke of Rudling. There have been 11 Lassie films, the first eight made by MGM. But after The Painted Hills (1951), MGM felt Lassie was a failing attraction and sold the television rights. Various Lassie dogs then starred on the box for 19 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
