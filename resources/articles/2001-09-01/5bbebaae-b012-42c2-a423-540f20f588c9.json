Choice of airlines will be influenced by people's perception of the level of risk to their flight. Several senior industry experts, who preferred not to be named, forecast that many travellers are likely to avoid all US carriers because of the risk of them being targeted for further terrorist attacks. It was significant that last week's hijackers chose American and United Airlines flights. American Airlines has been the world's largest carrier since it bought the impoverished TWA earlier this year. And it leapfrogged United to get to the top spot, so these breaches of security send the dual message that even the biggest, strongest carriers are not impregnable, and therefore all other US airlines are as much if not more vulnerable. The other large US carriers such as Delta, Northwest Airlines, Continental, South West and US Airways also face passenger desertion - but smaller airlines will suffer too. UK carriers British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and BMI British Midland are likely to see demand for their transatlantic services, once they resume, decimated. To a lesser extent, passengers may be reluctant to travel on the rest of their networks for fear of being a terrorist target on the basis of Britain's traditional strong support for US foreign policy. Airlines such as Air France and Lufthansa could suffer as high-profile representatives of major Nato member countries operating out of major European financial centres Paris and, particularly, Frankfurt. Sabena's home base of Brussels is also Nato's European headquarters. And the experts forecast that UK citizens will be reluctant to travel on airlines and to places where they could either be individual targets on the basis of their nationality, or become caught up in any conflicts arising from last week's events. Airlines likely to be less popular as a result include: Emirates, Egyptair, Kuwait Airlines, British Mediterranean, Middle East Airlines, Air India, Malaysian Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
