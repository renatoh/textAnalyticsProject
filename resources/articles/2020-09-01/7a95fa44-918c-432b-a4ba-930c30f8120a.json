Fox 11 Los Angeles obtained recordings of communications between the aircraft and the tower as the pilots approached the airport. \u201cTower, American 1997, we just passed a guy in a jetpack,\u201d a pilot said. \u201cAmerican 1997, OK, thank you, were they off to your left side or your right side?\u201d the controller asked. \u201cOff the left side at maybe 300 yards or so at our altitude,\u201d the pilot said. Another pilot also reported a sighting. \u201cWe just saw the guy pass by us in the jetpack,\u201d he said. The controller then advised another aircraft flight crew to use caution. \u201cPerson in a jetpack reported 300 yards south of the LA final at about 3,000ft, 10-mile final,\u201d the controller said. An FBI spokeswoman, Laura Eimiller, told the LA Times that the agency was also investigating the incident. \u201cThe FBI is aware of the reports by pilots on Sunday and is working to determine what occurred,\u201d the agency said in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
