But, as time went on, people started to realise that she was the real thing. So, yeah, she eventually did get the correct reputation, but at first it was just blown out of the water by the headline-grabbing marriage.\u201d He has a point. Before she met and married him, in March 1969, Linda Eastman was an award-winning photographer. Born in 1941 and raised in a suburb of New York, she had studied under Hazel Archer \u2013 who taught the artist Robert Rauschenberg, among others \u2013 and was the first woman to shoot a Rolling Stone cover, featuring Eric Clapton. Her speciality was capturing pop stars in unguarded moments: a tearful Aretha Franklin; Jimi Hendrix mid-yawn; Janis Joplin backstage, her bottle of Southern Comfort already drained. But marriage to a Beatle tended to overshadow your own work and reputation, as Yoko Ono discovered. It wasn\u2019t until years later that her talent was reappraised: 1976\u2019s unassumingly titled book Linda\u2019s Pictures was the first in a series of collections of her work. If anything, her reputation has grown since her death in 1998 \u2013 The Linda McCartney Retrospective, at Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow, is just the latest global exhibition of her work. It was curated by McCartney, along with their daughters, Mary and Stella; here, he picks six of his favourite photographs. \u201cAs you can probably tell,\u201d he says, after an exhaustive account of one of the McCartneys\u2019 family holidays in Orkney in the early 70s, \u201cI like talking about this stuff.\u201d BB King, 1968 \u201cThis was taken before I got to know her. Linda was the resident photographer at the [music venue] Fillmore East in New York. She would go to the Fillmore, or other events, and there would be other photographers there, who would say to her: \u2018Who\u2019s this? Who\u2019s this guy playing?\u2019 and she would know. She loved the music so much, she listened to it all the time, so she just knew: this is the Grateful Dead, this is BB King, this is Buddy Guy, this is Janis Joplin, you know? That always comes to mind when I see this picture; I imagine her crouched down, by the stage, taking photos of BB King. \u201cShe was a great believer in the happy accident. Where other people might have said: \u2018Well, this is blurred, we can\u2019t use this one, we\u2019ll go and look for the sharper photographs,\u2019 she went with it. I love this picture \u2013 his guitar looks like an instrument from the future, a space-age thing. It just looks to me like his music sounds: exciting blues. A friend of ours, Brian Clarke, made a stained-glass window of this image, which is fabulous: I\u2019ve got it in my studio.\u201d The Beatles, 1967 \u201cThis is the press launch for Sergeant Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band, at Brian Epstein\u2019s house in Belgravia \u2013 24 Chapel Street [in London]. We were lining up for various photographers and Linda was one of them. I think it was the second time I\u2019d met her. She\u2019d come to England to do the photos for a book, Rock And Other Four-Letter Words, by a writer called J Marks. She photographed the Animals, the Yardbirds, a lot of British acts for the book, and she was invited along to this. \u201cOne of the great things about Linda was she knew when to click. The photographers she admired were people who got those off-the-cuff moments \u2013 Walker Evans, [Henri] Cartier-Bresson, [Jacques Henri] Lartigue \u2013 where what they\u2019re doing is a form of reportage that actually moved into art. If you think about the famous Cartier-Bresson photo of the guy jumping over a puddle [Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, 1932] \u2013 it\u2019s all about capturing that split-second. Linda could instinctively feel a moment happening. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened here. John and I have gone [posh voice]: \u2018Hello, old chap, how are you?\u2019 \u2018Nice to meet you, jolly good!\u2019 You\u2019ve got John being funny, me in stitches at him and George and Ringo both loving it. It shows the relationship between us all. \u201cLinda put you at your ease. Some photographers, you\u2019re very aware that you\u2019re having a picture taken. But she had such a relaxed attitude that she\u2019d get a picture of Jimi Hendrix, but he\u2019d be yawning in it. He felt comfortable enough to yawn, she felt confident enough to take a picture of him yawning, knowing he wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d John and Paul, 1968 \u201cThis is me and John, in Abbey Road. It wasn\u2019t too long before the breakup of the Beatles; this would be the end of our relationship and, at the end, when the breakup happened, it was kind of sour \u2013 very difficult to deal with. The rumour started going around that John and I didn\u2019t get on well, we were arch-rivals, that it was very heavy and ugly. The strange thing is you sometimes get to believe something, if it\u2019s said enough times. So I used to think: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s a pity, you know, we didn\u2019t get on that well.\u2019 \u201cSo this picture is a blessing for me. It\u2019s like, this is how we were: this is why we related, or else we couldn\u2019t have collaborated for all that time. It sums up what our relationship was like the minute we were actually working on a song, and most of the time we were together, really. I\u2019m just writing something out \u2013 possibly it\u2019s a medley or something; it might be for Abbey Road \u2013 and it\u2019s lovely, because John is very happily in on the process, and agreeing with me, and we\u2019re laughing about something. Just seeing the joy between us here really helped me, because it reminds me that the idea we weren\u2019t friends is rubbish. We were lifelong friends, our relationship was super-special. \u201cThat applied to all the Beatles, even when we were pissed off with each other from time to time. People used to remind me: that\u2019s families, that happens. Mates disagree. As soon as we started working on music, we gelled, we just enjoyed the noise we made together, we enjoyed playing with each other. We\u2019d worked together for over 10,000 hours over the years, and that old spirit automatically kicked in. Any disputes were got over very quickly.\u201d My Love, 1978 \u201cThis was taken in London in 1978. I love it because it\u2019s a historic piece, because the cars and everything date it, but it\u2019s also a really good portrait of me. \u201cTechnically, I still don\u2019t get this one, because there\u2019s me in the rear-view mirror and I\u2019m in focus, but the houses are in focus and the bus is in focus as well. So I don\u2019t get how that worked. It\u2019s not a montage, it\u2019s a straight photo. And the other thing is that I\u2019m driving, and I think Linda is taking the picture with one of our babies on her lap \u2013 if you look, there\u2019s a very faint reflection in the windscreen. Talk about multi-tasking. \u201cOne of the things about Linda, when you talk about how people seem at ease in her photos, is that it was her lifestyle. We\u2019d say: \u2018Let\u2019s go out of London,\u2019 so I\u2019d just drive, we\u2019d get out of London and I\u2019d say: \u2018Where do you want to go?\u2019 She\u2019d say: \u2018Just anywhere.\u2019 After a while, you\u2019d end up in areas you didn\u2019t know, going: \u2018Ooh, I\u2019m getting a bit lost here,\u2019 and she\u2019d say: \u2018Great.\u2019 You were in places you\u2019d never been, you were seeing things you hadn\u2019t intended to see, all of which was rich stuff for her photography. I remember I wrote the song Two of Us about that \u2013 \u2018Two of us riding nowhere / Spending someone\u2019s hard-earned pay.\u2019 That was one of those excursions, when we were first going out together, this great idea of getting lost. Until I met Linda, I panicked when I got lost, you know?\u201d Mother and child, 1969 \u201cLinda took a lot of pictures of ordinary people that to her seemed extraordinary. This was when we were in Greece on holiday. We wouldn\u2019t go to the big places; we\u2019d just go to a little beach. That was very much my relationship with Linda. She\u2019d had a reasonably strict upbringing, what with her father being a lawyer, but then she\u2019d started to smell freedom when she went to university in Arizona. She loved riding, she had a horse out there that her friend\u2019s parents let her ride \u2026 it was the dangerous seeds of freedom. And when she met me, I\u2019d been like a robot, having to go on tour, make a record, go on tour, do this \u2013 and I\u2019d had it up to here. So we started to have a life where we didn\u2019t have any plans. We\u2019d go to Greece, book a hotel and just bum around. That feeling, that sniffing freedom, it went all the way through her photography and my music [on 1970\u2019s McCartney and 1971\u2019s Ram]. \u201cOne day, we were just on the beach, having a swim, but she\u2019s seen this mother and child, and it\u2019s an interesting moment, so she\u2019s just grabbed her camera and snapped it. She wouldn\u2019t have used a whole reel on it; it could even be the only shot. Because she\u2019d had to do things quickly, she\u2019d just worked on the hoof, without an assistant. She didn\u2019t use light meters often \u2013 she guessed \u2013 so she just went out with a pocket stuffed with film, camera around her neck and that would be it. There\u2019s something fascinating about this moment she\u2019s caught, the way the kid is looking into the camera eerily, the mum with this incredible bathing hat on. I could look at it for hours.\u201d Paul, 1968 \u201cThis was at the airport in Los Angeles. I had to do something record-related \u2013 I think it was a convention that Capitol, our American record label, were having \u2013 and she happened to be in LA, so she could hang out with me. She\u2019d turn up at the hotel and we\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, what are we going to do today? Shall we do something? Well, let\u2019s just stay in,\u2019 and we\u2019d just do nothing, basically. We loved that freedom. It was an important thing in a relationship, that neither of us minded doing nothing much. \u201cSo this is us parting after our little trip. I was going back to England and she was catching another flight, going back to New York: I think I was there with a guy called Magic Alex [Mardas, the Beatles\u2019 notorious \u201celectronics wizard\u201d, whose various schemes reputedly cost the band about \u00a35m in today\u2019s money without yielding any results]. While we were waiting, she would just have her camera there, lift it up, click, get the shot, put it down again. So I\u2019m goofing; I\u2019ve pulled my jacket up and sort of masked my face. I\u2019m going back to England, back to the Beatles, and I\u2019m hiding: \u2018No photos please!\u2019 It was just a joyous little moment before we went our separate ways. But, you know, luckily, we hooked up again and, er \u2026 made a go of it!\u201d The Linda McCartney Retrospective is at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow, from 5 July to 12 January 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
