She is, after all, a businesswoman, a fundraiser for underprivileged children in Africa, and notoriously difficult to take seriously whenever she is asked to go over well\u2011tilled ground about her game, her injuries or her opponents. So it was little surprise when the defending champion and betting and seedings favourite, who is in sight of her 13th slam (just behind her friend, Tiger Woods, in golf), gushed like a royal nanny yesterday as she contemplated the prospect of maybe meeting the Queen when she descends on Wimbledon for the first time in 33 years on Thursday. The Queen, who apparently does not much care for tennis, is nonetheless casting a regal shadow over this tournament, with obsequiousness reaching fever pitch even before she steps into the Royal Box. This was a gift for Williams. Let's talk about ... how to curtsy. \"Well, I definitely don't think I should take a bow, so I'll probably curtsy [smiling]. I've been working on my curtsy. It's a little extreme, so I'm going to have to tone it down a bit. I have a lot of arm movement. It's very extreme. I get really low.\" Not quite as low as some of the questioning, but she hardly takes that seriously anyway. After fielding inquiries about the USA embarrassing England at the World Cup \u2013 \"Man, my heart skipped several beats\" \u2013 she conceded that she is, actually, here to play some tennis. \"I don't feel pressure. You know, I'm here to win Wimbledon like the other [127] people in the draw. That's kind of how I look at it. Whether I come out with a win or whether I don't, it's just an opportunity for me to be here.\" Such flippancy is hard to accept. Since coming back from a sabbatical, taken to fix a knee problem after winning the Australian Open, Williams has worked as hard as anyone to find the dominance that has intimidated all but the very best for more than a decade. She did not look quite right on clay in Rome, nor in Paris. Now it is grass and she expects to be lifted by the surroundings, the atmosphere and the chance to pull clear of the Belgians, Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters, not to mention the second seed, her sister Venus. Asked about the comebacks of Henin and Clijsters, she said: \"It's cool they're back in the draw. It's fine. I answer this question every week, so ... look at my other transcripts.\" It is that sort of offhand response that wins her few friends but she feels no need to play the game anymore. If there is a deep-rooted belief that she never has won the unquestioning respect of the tennis tribe, it surfaces in moments like these, in between the pat answers and the sometimes strained laughter. And, as much as she really does love Wimbledon, she finds it difficult to fall into line with the fawning over the tournament. These are her moments of candour, mixed in with the game-playing verbals. Asked what was different about her preparation here, she said: \"I don't know. I approach every match the same, really, whether I'm here, whether I'm at, you know, a tournament in North Carolina or South Carolina. I just kind of look at it all the same. You go here and you do the best that you can and you try to just go for it.\" It is unlikely her first-round opponent, Michelle Larcher De Brito, will be able to do much about her serene progress other than go down shrieking with the loudest squeal in the game. The rest of the field will be on a razor edge, hoping they have caught Williams still struggling through her mini-comeback. And the crowd? They might reserve a good chunk of empathy for a more unlikely winner: the straight\u2011talking girl from Milan and the new French Open champion, Francesca Schiavone, who is 29 and getting delightfully younger by the day. Maria Sharapova has to be suspect because of her injuries; Sam Stosur's game is not best suited to grass. The odds are the same name will be on the Venus Rosewater Dish as has been the case every year but one this millennium: Williams. And, most probably, it will be Serena."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
