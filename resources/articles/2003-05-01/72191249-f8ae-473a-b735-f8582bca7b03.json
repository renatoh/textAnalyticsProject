Less than a week after their epic victory over Leeds in the Challenge Cup final, they came from 8-0 behind to snatch their sixth successive Super League win in the most dramatic circumstances, when Leon Pryce collected a delicate chip from James Lowes to score his second try with less than four minutes remaining. Defeat was cruel on a young Wigan side who could not be faulted for effort with Craig Smith and Brian Carney both picking up injuires, but at the moment the force is with the Bulls. Bradford's coach Brian Noble judged that the Bulls' Cardiff hangover had cleared sufficiently to name an unchanged starting 13, with Richard Moore replacing Karl Pratt on the bench in the only change from their cup final squad. However, Wigan caught them cold with a wonderful try inside the first minute. Nick Graham, the new signing from Sydney, started the move with his first touch for the club and another Australian, Jamie Ainscough, finished it with his first touch in more than a month. Danny Tickle was unable to convert but landed a penalty midway through the first half when Lowes impeded Paul Johnson at a ruck, and Wigan's defence, picking up where it had left off against St Helens on Good Friday, did the rest to secure a 6-0 half-time lead. Tickle extended Wigan's lead by a further two points when a clever kick by Sean O'Loughlin earned a penalty early in the second half. But with 20 minutes remaining, Bradford were level. Pryce was the key figure, first stepping and sliding through some weak Wigan defence to score on the left, and then releasing an overhead pass that Paul Deacon did superbly to flick on to Lesley Vainikolo, who touched down in the left corner. However Deacon was unable to convert either try. \u00b7 St Helens romped to a 38-0 win at Halifax last night with Anthony Stewart scoring a hat trick, and Kieron Cunningham making his first appearance since suffering a dislocated elbow last November.
