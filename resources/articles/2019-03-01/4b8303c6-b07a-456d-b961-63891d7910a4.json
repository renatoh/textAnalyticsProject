Back in 2007 it was a toss-up between him and Gary Megson for the job but Milan Mandaric and his board eventually decided that, at 34 years old, the then-Chelsea reserve coach was marginally too big a risk in a cutthroat Championship. \u201cTwelve years later I\u2019m enriched by all my experiences, good and bad, but I\u2019ve always tried to remain committed in my life as a coach and always positive,\u201d he said, holding court at the Midlands club that is now belatedly his home. \u201cThe word you sometimes get is \u2018deluded\u2019, they use, but for me I\u2019ve always been very positive.\u201d It seemed a very specific choice of word, and minds immediately shot to the popular \u2018Deluded Brendan\u2019 Twitter account that has lampooned Rodgers\u2019s perceived quixotism since his time at Liverpool. Was he referring to a particular usage? \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m saying that in general life people will say that because you\u2019re positive, you\u2019re deluded.\u201d Yet there was nothing obviously air-headed about leaving Celtic, where a truly incorrigible dreamer might have stayed to keep records tumbling. Leicester\u2019s league position tells nothing of a three-year period that has taken in unimaginable highs and tragic lows; it is a club that needs stability, a consistent identity, while aiming to scale the heights again and his choice to accept their offer was carefully calculated. \u201cIf I was making the decision normally, with my heart, I\u2019d never leave Celtic,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life was great. I loved the city, I loved the people, I loved the club. I had a wonderful life. If you think of all those things, you\u2019d never move. \u201cBut I\u2019m in a career where certain challenges will come up. And I felt that after nearly three years at Celtic, where we won seven trophies and created a mindset that was about winning, and did it in the way I would have liked, I had to make a decision. And, unfortunately, it was probably not the right timing. However, you have to make the decision.\u201d Leicester face another of his former employers, Watford, on Sunday. This \u201cfeels the right club \u2026 as if I\u2019ve been here longer\u201d he said, and it was eye-opening to hear his perception of what, since the title win in 2016, has changed. \u201cI think what\u2019s happened here was all very natural,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see it in sport, you see it in business. A lot of it is subconscious. You think of the journey this club was on, from being in League One to getting promoted, then staying up by the skin of your teeth. Then bang, you win the league. \u201cThen at the end of the season you go on a world tour, and it\u2019s great, everyone\u2019s lauding you because of what you\u2019ve done. Then you travel to Hull and lose 2-1 in your first game [of the 2016-17 season]. After nine or 10 games everyone\u2019s wondering: \u2018what\u2019s happening here?\u2019 There\u2019s a little bit of complacency; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intentional. You don\u2019t quite run the same; where you pressed for 10 metres, you\u2019re now only pressing eight. It\u2019s just gradual, but everyone still expects. But now it\u2019s a chance to press the reset button; to come in with a clear vision, a more realistic look at where we\u2019re at.\u201d On Wednesday, his first day at the club but supposedly one of rest for the squad, he kept his door open for meetings and saw Kasper Schmeichel, among others, take up the invitation. This group has, as Claudio Ranieri and Claude Puel found, a reputation for being particularly strong-willed but it is a dynamic Rodgers believes will serve him well. \u201cI will very much lead them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you tend to find with [this type of player] is that they are the players that actually really care about doing well. When something is not right they will have an opinion. I am so happy to have that type of player here because they are ambitious. They want it to work well. As long as you give them purpose and are clear on how you want to work then I think they will thrive on that.\u201d He enjoys communicating with a generation he accepts are \u201cthe most self-interested they have ever been\u201d, believing their hunger to maximise their careers melds with his commitment to improving them. A group of lavish young talents including James Maddison, Wilfred Ndidi, Harvey Barnes and Ben Chilwell will be asked to play with a greater intensity than they displayed under Puel, although Rodgers knows the physicality that permits such an approach cannot be developed overnight. He hopes to show, too, that his own outlook has evolved since what was \u201ca tough end for us\u201d at Liverpool in 2015. \u201cYou are always developing,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Celtic it\u2019s very unique. People won\u2019t understand it unless you know it. You have to win every single game. That\u2019s why if you\u2019re playing PSG, Barcelona, Alloa or Partick Thistle you have to prepare like it\u2019s a cup final. I\u2019ve come into the Premier League now a better coach.\u201d A dozen years since that sliding-doors moment with Mandaric and Megson, he has the chance to channel that positivity into something unmistakable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
