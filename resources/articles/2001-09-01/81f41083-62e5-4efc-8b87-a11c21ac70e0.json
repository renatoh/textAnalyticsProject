The first official inquiry into the crisis-ridden company, carried out by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries, the professional body for the insurance industry, chronicles persistent failure to spot growing liabilities, inadequate reserving and provisioning, and management practices which prevented \"whistle-blowers\" from drawing attention to the firm's impending problems. It says that at several points during the 1980s action could have been taken to stave off the crisis, which has hit 1m policyholders. It reveals that in 1994, following a decline in annuity rates, Equitable was preparing a communication to policyholders which may have highlighted its liabilities, but then withdrew it when annuity rates rose again. Another fall in annuity rates in the late 1990s was the crucial factor which drove Equitable into crisis - it made the annuity guarantees built into pre-1988 contracts highly valuable, and Equitable did not have enough reserves to cover the cost of payment. Equitable also persistently underestimated the number of policyholders who might take up the annuity guarantee, it says. The report steps back from naming individual managers at fault. \"We had no power to accuse, or excuse, any individual, nor would we wish to have been given that power,\" said the inquiry, chaired by former Clerical Medical chief execu tive Roger Corley. Instead, it recommends a major overhaul in the ability of actuaries to run insurance companies with only limited external supervision. It proposes that the role of chief executive and appointed actuary, which in Equitable's case was the same person, should in future be split. It will also insist on the publication of an annual \"financial condition report\" to keep insurance firms under peer group scrutiny. Equitable Life, now under new management, said: \"We are surprised that the enquiry has shied away from discussing culpability. The new board has instructed lawyers Herbert Smith to examine the conduct of all those associated with the problems the society is facing. \"The primary recommendation for an external peer review merely appears to trans fer responsibility from one actuary to another. It is difficult to see how this provides greater protection for policyholders.We will ensure that there is no whitewash at Equitable Life.\" In a rare piece of good news for Equitable policyholders, chief executive Charles Thomson revealed that the fire sale of equities that followed its closure to new business in December has protected it from the worst of the recent market fall. When the crisis first struck, Equitable had nearly 70% of its \u00a334bn funds in equities, but cut the figure to 50%, buying bonds instead so that it could meet its liabilities. As the sale took place when shares were 20-30% higher than today, Equitable may have one of the best one-year performance records in the sector."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
