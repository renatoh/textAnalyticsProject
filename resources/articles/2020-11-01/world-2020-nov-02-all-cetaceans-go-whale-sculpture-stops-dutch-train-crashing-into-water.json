The metro driver was reportedly able to free himself from the train without injury after the incident shortly after midnight on Monday morning. There were no passengers onboard. Maarten Struijs, who made the sculpture of two tails emerging from water beneath the elevated metro line, said he was surprised the sculpture had held together. He said: \u201cI could never have imagined it that way, but it saved the operator\u2019s life. The damage is an afterthought. \u201cI am amazed that it is so strong. When plastic has stood for 20 years, you don\u2019t expect it to hold up a metro train.\u201d The artwork was erected in 2002 by the De Akkers station in Spijkenisse on the outskirts of Rotterdam, in the Dutch province of South Holland. It is made of reinforced polyester. Its original name was Whale Tails \u2013 but within hours of the train incident the local authority renamed it Saved by a Whale\u2019s Tale. The emergency services were seeking to secure the scene on Monday. \u201cGiven the complexity, this will take some time,\u201d a spokesman for the Rotterdam-Rijnmond safety region said. \u201cIt will be quite an exercise to get that thing off and get it safe.\u201d It was as yet unclear what caused the train to overrun the station. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2020 to explain that the whale sculpture began life with a name different from the one hastily bestowed by the local authority after the train incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
