But perhaps this line has never more aptly applied than last week during Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s tirade against Bill Shorten. Yes, Turnbull\u2019s attack was nothing more than sound and fury. It was quite furious, a side of the prime minister we have seen before (election night) and hear whispers about \u2013 but rarely is that fury on such public display. Turnbull\u2019s attack was laden with personal smear and insult. It signified nothing of substance. But Macbeth\u2019s lament is even more relevant to Turnbull. Macbeth utters these words as he realises his demise is near. He is reflecting that his great acts \u2013 namely, murdering King Duncan and taking his throne \u2013 are meaningless. His own reign, and indeed his life, is about to come to an end. In that moment, Macbeth possesses the self-awareness to see that his seizure of leadership has failed. Duncan\u2019s son \u2013 coincidentally, for our purposes, named Malcolm \u2013 is about to storm the castle and take back the crown. Macbeth sees clearly that all he has said and done will amount to little. He seems to grasp that he was probably not suited to the (literal) cut and thrust of leadership. Life\u2019s but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. Turnbull may not yet possess Macbeth\u2019s clear-eyed understanding of his fate but he is going to share it soon, and he is starting to hear the drumbeat of the advancing armies. What else can explain the sudden attack on Shorten? For the best part of the past year, even during the election campaign, Turnbull adopted a benign posture towards the Labor leader. In the adversarial, robust nature of Australian politics, Turnbull\u2019s inattention to his opponent was weird. Perhaps Turnbull saw Shorten as unworthy of his contempt, so beneath his intellectual level and innate charm as to not merit attack. Of course, Shorten and the Labor opposition are not the only army coming for Turnbull. One Nation is making significant inroads into the Coalition base, building on the four Senate seats gained under Turnbull\u2019s double-dissolution election. The Liberal senator Cory Bernardi is a Liberal no more, jumping ship to form a new party, Australian Conservatives. The rump of conservative MPs left \u2013 Tony Abbott, Eric Abetz and George Christensen, to name a few \u2013 are emboldened and empowered by their ability to attract media and restrict Turnbull\u2019s choices. Newspoll is on a downward spiral, the budget deficit is on an upward spiral, and the Western Australian Liberals are preferencing One Nation above their Coalition partners, the Nationals, in the upper house in next month\u2019s state election. Turnbull has been mocked and ridiculed by the Republican president of the United States. On top of it all, a whole host of conservative commentators \u2013 from Andrew Bolt to Peta Credlin to Judith Sloan and Rowan Dean \u2013 continually broadcast Turnbull\u2019s failings. Shorten is just the one Turnbull can attack, and attack he did. Who can blame him for lashing out? His castle is crumbling. The Australian right is fracturing between social conservatives, ideologues, identity politicians, economic irrationalism and small-L liberalism. The times do not suit Turnbull. Like Macbeth, he lacks the personal qualities required for great leadership. Greeted like a god when he took the prime ministership, Turnbull has proven mightily mortal and flawed. Last week he took the only path left: fight, attack, try to defend. Macbeth, aware of his looming demise, clings to the belief that he is invincible and takes up arms to defend his throne. He even commits murder in his own defence. Still, for Macbeth, it is futile. He is beheaded and Prince Malcolm is restored to the throne. No doubt Turnbull would prefer to see himself as his namesake in the play \u2013 the deposed leader who, in 2015, removed the interloper Abbott and claimed the position that is his birthright. Alas, that is not where history will cast him. Instead, the only question that seems to remain: who will play Prince Malcolm in Australia\u2019s unfolding political tragedy? Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time, and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! We await the next act."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
