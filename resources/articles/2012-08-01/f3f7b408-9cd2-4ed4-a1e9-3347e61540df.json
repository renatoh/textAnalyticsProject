The Premier League champions had hoped to tie up a deal for the 23-year-old midfielder this week as Roberto Mancini tries to bolster his squad before the transfer window deadline. However, the Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins revealed on Monday that the two clubs have yet to agree a deal. Sinclair was left out of the Swans squad for Saturday's home game with West Ham United and has told the club he will not sign a new contract. That had given Mancini hope that a deal could be reached. The City manager said on Sunday that new signings were crucial for his team to retain their title. But Jenkins told BBC Wales: \"We haven't actually agreed any deal with Man City at the moment. I would have thought if they really wanted to sign Scott Sinclair they would have dealt with it a little bit better than they have. But that's their business. \"But it has dragged on too long and I hope one way or another it will be concluded in the next couple of days.\" Jenkins said manager Michael Laudrup is hoping to further strengthen his squad before Friday's deadline. Swansea have brought in the Spaniards Chico and Michu, the latter scoring three times in his first two games, as well as the Dutchman Jonathan de Guzman and the South Korean Ki Sung-yeung this summer, while the midfielder Joe Allen left to join former manager Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool. \"Hopefully, over the next few days, we'll get a couple more signings in and we can put the transfer window behind us at the end of the month,\" Jenkins added. \"Our proposed signing of a couple of players is not dependent on Scott's transfer out. I think it's more about numbers and making sure we have the right number in the squad.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
