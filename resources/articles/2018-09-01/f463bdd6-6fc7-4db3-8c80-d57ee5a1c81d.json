From the moment Steven Gerrard was appointed as Rangers manager, his duel with Brendan Rodgers was a source of fascination. On Sunday, Celtic versus Rangers, to all intents and purposes, becomes Rodgers versus Gerrard. Brendan versus Stevie G. The true dynamic of the relationship between this pair, as manager and captain at Liverpool, has never been fully explained. Snippets from Gerrard\u2019s autobiography suggest friction, but perhaps occasional friction is inevitable given the environment. Gerrard was by far the more significant figure at Liverpool but a player whose exit coincided with Rodgers\u2019 spell in charge. Amid a ferocious atmosphere in Glasgow\u2019s east end, the two will be professionally reacquainted. \u201cI think everybody wants there to be a problem,\u201d says Gerrard. \u201cI think they want a UFC match on the side. There\u2019s no problem, it [our relationship] is fine. \u201cI know a lot about him and his tactics. I know how he wants to play but Brendan is a clever coach and always has something up his sleeve. The reason why I respect him as a coach is that he always had something different. I think it would be very naive of me to expect what we see a lot of from the Celtic team. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he tried something different to try and catch us cold. That\u2019s what he would do as Liverpool manager.\u201d Experience and an obvious steeliness means Gerrard would never be intimidated by the ferocity of Glasgow\u2019s derby. He raises an eyebrow when asked whether the rivalry between Liverpool and Everton retains its friendly billing. \u201cIt\u2019s hatred,\u201d says the 38-year-old. \u201cHalf of Merseyside liked me, half never have and never will. That\u2019s life. Having been to a few Old Firm games, I knew what I was coming in to. So it hasn\u2019t blown me away but when you\u2019re in it, it does feel that bit warmer and intense. It\u2019s very similar to Liverpool. The demands and the expectations are the same. \u201cI think to a certain extent all the rivalries are the same but because Scotland has these two huge football clubs then it does get magnified that bit more and because of the history of the two clubs and the fact they are in heavy competition. I don\u2019t sit in my house because of it. I try to live my life as normally as I can.\u201d The on-field scenario here is a fascinating one. Gerrard denies any sense he has bought himself leeway by leading Rangers \u2013 by virtue of 12 unbeaten matches \u2013 back to the group phase of the Europa League, but Thursday evening\u2019s aggregate success in Russia was an early, significant point. Beyond the fevered excitement attached to Gerrard and Rangers, there is evidence he actually knows what he is doing. Yet, and exertions across the continent partly explain this, should Rangers lose to their oldest foes the domestic points tally would sit at five from a possible 12. In that circumstance, Rangers would already trail Celtic by four. Celtic reached beyond all expectations when they completed a second domestic clean sweep in a row in May but the club has suddenly become fraught. Rodgers\u2019s frustrations with his board of directors with regard to transfers had been clear even before last week when he found himself in open dispute with a key asset, Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, over an exit or otherwise for the France Under\u201121s striker, who eventually joined Lyon amid acrimony on Friday. That Celtic are in the Europa League is also viewed as a major comedown after back-to-back seasons in the Champions League. \u201cI love a challenge,\u201d Gerrard adds. \u201cI understand this challenge as a whole but with Brendan being up here and being successful it made the challenge tougher. It hasn\u2019t put me off and I\u2019ll work as hard as I can to try and upset the situation. \u201cI wanted to do the job no matter who was in charge of Celtic. For me it\u2019s not about me trying to topple Brendan, it\u2019s Rangers trying to compete with Celtic again because I don\u2019t think they have been competitive enough over the last couple of years. My job initially is to try to close the gap and make this team competitive, not just with Celtic but also with the other top teams in the league, and try to make these fans happy again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
