Replacing the Andrew Neil-fronted politics series This Week, the series will maintain many of the pod\u2019s features as well as presenters Chris Mason, Laura Kuenssberg, Adam Fleming and Katya Adler. You can read our behind-the-scenes piece about the podcast here. The first annual Windrush Day, celebrating the contribution made by the Windrush generation and its descendants, takes place this Saturday. To coincide with the event, legendary children\u2019s TV presenter Baroness Floella Benjamin is releasing a new podcast mini-series that recounts her experience as one of those who made the long journey to Britain, and the hostility she faced when she arrived. The first episode of From the Heart with Floella Benjamin is available from Saturday. The London Podcast Festival has unveiled the first wave of acts for its 2019 edition. Among those performing live this year are veteran podder Adam Buxton, actor and Trolled podcast presenter Tracy Ann Oberman and Years and Years actor Russell Tovey.

Tickets for the festival , which runs from 6th-15th September at Kings Place, can be bought here. Gwilym Mumford Picks of the week Revisionist History \u201cI\u2019m back, baby!\u201d Malcolm Gladwell returns with a new season of his popular podcast re-interpreting events from the past. In the opening episode, he\u2019s taking a law school admissions test to see if he can beat his assistant\u2019s score. With anxiety nightmares kicking in, he\u2019ll need more than a clear plastic bag full of trail mix to get through it. Gladwell sounds like he\u2019s messing about, but can\u2019t hide his massive intelligence. Future episodes include a special about Jesuit thinking and the question of why Pat Boone isn\u2019t in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Hannah Verdier Man in the Window Any true-crime story is in safe hands with Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Paige St John, who narrates this podcast about the Golden State Killer. Even the trailer sets up the doom nicely, via a vignette about a teenager breaking off her engagement with a Vietnam war veteran who throws the ring away in a rage. Over the first few episodes, what starts out as the case of a 70s-style peeping tom or cat burglar soon takes a sinister turn and the crimes start to pile up. It\u2019s properly chilling. HV Guardian Pick: Brexit Means\u2026 As the Tory leadership campaign heats up enough to make Rory Stewart remove his tie, Britain\u2019s exit from the EU continues to play a starring role. But being front and centre doesn\u2019t seem to be bringing any more clarity. Some of the contenders claim \u2013 despite the EU saying otherwise \u2013 that they can bring back a new deal, while others believe they can push through May\u2019s thrice-failed offering. All of which sounds very machismo. But is there any chance that whoever succeeds May will be able to actually deliver Brexit? And if so, what will that look like? Jon Henley et al attempt to answer in this month\u2019s episode of Brexit Means. Max Sanderson"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
