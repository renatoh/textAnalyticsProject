There has been no word yet on whether the furlough will be furloughed furlong or if it will just be a short-term outage. Like the virus that inspired it, it does not seem like long ago that nobody had even heard of the furlough, but having gained a foothold in the population it has swept the nation with haste. The Premier League has not been immune, with hundreds of normally-productive employees at Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich now in isolation away from their clubs. Liverpool\u2019s fans were the first to successfully fight off the infection, discovering that it is possible to combat even aggressive cases of furlough using the commonly-available medicine of public outrage. \u201cWe believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week, and are truly sorry for that,\u201d said Liverpool\u2019s chief executive, Peter Moore, in an open letter to fans. The Reds will thus continue to pay their employees using the cash bloating their own bank accounts, while other owners of top-flight clubs have concluded that they would do anything (furlough), but they won\u2019t do that. Tottenham Hotspur Supporters\u2019 Trust is continuing to apply a similar remedy to their own club\u2019s case of furlough, nearly a week after it exhibited its first symptoms despite pre-tax profits in the year to 30 June 2018 at a wild \u00a3138.9m. \u201cWe have been saying consistently \u2013 pause and rethink,\u201d they said on Twitter. \u201cWe are now saying it clearly and in public \u2013 do not further damage the club\u2019s reputation, listen to your fans.\u201d Former Spurs striker Gary Lineker also took to social media in an attempted to resuscitate the club\u2019s moral compass, but so far it remains unresponsive. It remains to be seen whether they and other wealthy clubs infected with furlough suffer long-term side-effects, should potential customers decide to impose some financial self-isolation upon them by steering well clear as a result.

You\u2019re not responsible, you\u2019re bang out of order. I\u2019d be looking to get him out the club to be honest. That ain\u2019t right. You end up believing all the hype and feeling you can control the world and do anything you like\u201d \u2013 Ian Holloway, who loves a party as much as the next man, lets rip on Kyle Walker after the England defender broke quarantine rules by hosting a party with two sex workers.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cSuedehead [Monday\u2019s Fiver letters]? Oh, please. The early \u201870s skinhead cut was about a 2, and the suedehead cut was about a 4 (and it was much more about the clothes, anyway). The Cheltenham players in the pictures have just shaved their heads. A sacrifice, true, but in the early 70s we\u2019d just have assumed they were in the Army\u201d \u2013 Joe Mercer. \u201cMy least favourite game (Friday\u2019s Fiver letters)? England 2-3 Netherlands, a Wednesday night in 2012. Travelled down from Manchester, then a tube over to Wembley only for the driver, two or three stops away, to say the line was cancelled. Forced to walk to Wembley which was a speck in the distance, missed the first hour only to finally get in and watch England lose. Then do the reverse trip home. Shudders\u201d \u2013 Paul Jordan. \u201cEmpathy abounds with my fellow 1,056 readers. However, given the current climate, the chance to revisit the 1997 Division One play-off final [between Crystal Palace and Sheffield United], after staring at my knees for 89 minutes due to excess of Tin and then finally looking up in the 89th minute to witness David Hopkin condemning us to another year of ignominy, I would gladly give either arm for\u201d \u2013 Paul Barlow. \u201cCan I extend my never-ending sympathy for the West Ham fans who trekked north in 1990 to watch their team in the Milk Cup semi-final first leg. It was at Oldham. That was bad enough but the weather was typically Oldham. They reached the ground soaking wet because of the lack of public transport (it hasn\u2019t changed) and then stood on the Rochdale Road End which had no roof (that\u2019s changed). It rained for the full 90 minutes. What could go wrong? The Hammers were only facing Oldham. Six-nil to the Latics! Oh we laughed in the Chaddy End, especially me; an ex-patriot Londoner and Chelsea fan. OK, so it was one of my best matches but I can do empathy\u201d \u2013 Peter Holford.
