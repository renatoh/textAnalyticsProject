Then they came for pasta, rice and tinned food. A week or so later, there was a shortage of napkins, paper towels and tissues. On 22 March there was a run on bottle shops, as shoppers, thinking outlets might close under new laws, stockpiled alcohol. In the confusion as to whether bottle shops were an essential service, trolleys were stacked with spirits, wine and cases of beer. \u201cCan report there is now panic buying at Dan Murphy\u2019s. Every car space in our local branch is full, everyone is loading up. We\u2019re going to be one trashed socially isolated nation for a while,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter. Commsec reported spending was up more than 20% in the week ending 20 March, compared with the same time last year; and in the week to March 27, spending at liquor stores in Australia was up 86%. Although that rise was off-set by the closure of bars, restaurants and pubs, that week Australians still spent 34% more on alcohol than at the same period the previous year. Now we\u2019re all sitting at home drinking our stockpiled alcohol and having parties on apps, but experts are warning that as well as the pandemic, we\u2019re facing another public health crisis \u2013 heavy drinking. Peter, a 59-year-old marketing manager from Sydney\u2019s upper north shore, was one of those stockpiling alcohol on the weekend of 22 March. His wife brought three cases of champagne, while he bought \u201ctwo lots of wine \u2013 three crates [12 bottles] both times \u2013 and it\u2019s time to refresh those\u201d. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been working from home, I\u2019ve been slipping into bad ways. I\u2019m not concerned about it yet \u2013 but it\u2019s not a good habit,\u201d says Peter, who has been in lockdown for two weeks. Before quarantine, he only drank on weekends, but now he says, \u201cWe\u2019re both [Peter and his wife] working from home and we\u2019ve been drinking every day starting at 5.30pm. Right now, there\u2019s no consequences \u2013 no one notices if you get a bit wooly the next day, and other people are in the same boat. There\u2019s a lot of drinking memes going round. I am not at all surprised that \u2026 sales are going through the roof,\u201d he says. Professor Michael Farrell, director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales Sydney, says the scenes broadcast from crowded bottle shops in late March showed \u201cthere\u2019s been an assault on bottle shops \u2013 and it\u2019s very clear that sales have gone up. The vulnerability is for people who are already on the margins of heavy drinking. They have had their constraints removed from them.\u201d These constraints, removed by staying at home, include being able to drink during the day, or being hungover without being detected by employers. But he says people are also drinking because of \u201cthe anxiety about the complex social situation we are in. People are worried about their jobs, finances and getting ill. They are stockpiling alcohol \u2013 it\u2019s a social storm\u201d. Chris Raine, founder of Hello Sunday Morning, a movement that aims to help people reduce or quit drinking via an accountability app and online counselling, has noticed an \u201cuptick\u201d in the service since people started self-isolating. \u201cRegistrations have doubled,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite scary to be honest \u2013 it\u2019s a perfect storm because you have a culture that does rely on alcohol to de-stress and deal with anxiety and now those stresses and anxieties have gone through the roof as a result of the virus.\u201d Raine worries that under these conditions, \u201cit creates a situation where people are habituated to drinking daily\u201d. This unusual situation creates the possibility of a cascade effect, says Raine. Weekend drinkers become weekday drinkers; social drinkers become daily drinkers; and those struggling with sobriety, who have relied on the face-to-face assistance of groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (now using Zoom because of physical distancing rules), will relapse. Farrell agrees, saying people \u201care left socially isolated \u2013 so the normal help is gone\u201d. He hopes apps such as Daybreak (set up by Raine\u2019s Hello Sunday Morning team) will bridge the gap created by the suspension of face-to-face support groups and counselling. \u201cOne of the things you can do is promote telephone services for counselling people \u2013 it\u2019s not very hard to switch into that,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you can use apps to get support while isolating. Prevention programs will come later down the line.\u201d Farrell says right now \u201cthe only thing you could do [to halt the problem] potentially is to ration sales\u201d. Currently the industry\u2019s self-imposed ration limit is fairly generous, says Farrell. On 1 April, large alcohol retailers in most states (except Western Australia where there are already measures in force) signed up for a voluntary code that limits the amount of liquor customers can buy in one transaction. Beer, cider and premixed spirits are limited to two cases, and wine to 12 bottles per customer, while cask wine and bottled spirits are limited to two items each. Any further restrictions, such as closing bottle shops, might be too much to bear, says Farrell, as \u201cthere is enough social control at the moment\u201d. Instead, \u201cwe should focus people on learning physical and mental health hygiene and good regimes around exercise and food. People should have a number of days where they forgo alcohol\u201d. When Raine saw \u201cthe rush on buying alcohol\u201d, he says, \u201cMy gut reaction was \u2018typical\u2019 and \u2018understandable\u2019 but then digging into it, it\u2019s how Australians see alcohol as an essential service \u2013 almost culturally seeing alcohol as an essential medicine.\u201d Raine acknowledges that if the bottle shops were not deemed an essential service and shut down, the results would be disastrous. \u201cYou\u2019d have tens of thousands of people going into involuntary detox and not having the health system able to cope. I wish people didn\u2019t culturally depend on alcohol the way they do.\u201d For people like Peter, entering his third week in social isolation, this is the week to start tracking his drinking. \u201cThere\u2019s moments where it\u2019s appropriate to say \u2018bugger it\u2019 and get drunk, but you can\u2019t maintain that throughout the crisis.\u201d Friday night was going to be Peter\u2019s first Zoom drinks with friends, but the following week he decided to go back to drinking only two nights a week, on weekends. \u201cIt\u2019s very novel territory \u2013 it\u2019s hard,\u201d says Raine. \u201cBut all difficult things bear the fruit of opportunity. And we can grow and become more resilient.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
