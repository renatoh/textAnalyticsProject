The proposals, which will be announced on Tuesday and will come into force by next June, will also aim to give workers a voice at boardroom level. But the plans fall short of the corporate governance revolution promised last year by Theresa May. A new corporate governance code will include stipulations for listed companies to assign a non-executive director to represent employees, create an employee advisory council or nominate a director from the workforce. However, this would be under a so-called \u201ccomply or explain\u201d basis, meaning companies could opt not to undertake any of the measures if they explain why they are not doing so. That represents a substantial change from May\u2019s original pledge on the subject. When running for the leadership of the Conservative party last year she suggested she would oblige big companies to have their workforce represented on boards. But in a speech to the business lobby group the CBI later in the year, May signalled she would backtrack on the idea that this should be mandatory, saying it was \u201ca question of finding the model that works\u201d. Listed companies which have faced regular shareholder opposition over top-level pay will also be included on a new public register. There will also be a voluntary set of guidelines for large private companies. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy billed the changes as a \u201cworld-leading package of corporate governance reforms\u201d and the package has won the support of the Institute of Directors (IoD) and the CBI. The requirement will mean that about 900 large listed companies will need to annually publish and justify the ratio of pay between their chief executive and the firm\u2019s average UK worker, BEIS said. But the plans were criticised by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and trade unions. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, described them as \u201ca feeble proposal, spelling business as usual for boardrooms across Britain\u201d. She said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s pledge to put workers on company boards has been watered down beyond all recognition. This now amounts to little more than a box-ticking exercise.\u201d During the general election Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, won support by focusing heavily on pay disparities, suggesting a possible pay cap that would limit the highest paid member of staff to 20 times the average worker for companies with public sector contracts. On Monday MonRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, described the government\u2019s proposals as \u201cjust more crony capitalism\u201d and questioned why the register of companies that face shareholder revolts would be maintained by the Investment Association, a City trade body. She said: \u201cThe Tory plan is a fraud, watering down a promise to increase workers\u2019 voices to a lone representative on the board of directors or a separate employee advisory council. Each of these will be easily outvoted or ignored. \u201cThe Tories seem to believe fixing Britain\u2019s broken system of corporate governance, which not only leads to scandals like BHS, extreme executive pay, but also growing inequality and stagnating wages, is just a matter of changing one or two nameplates around the boardroom table.\u201d Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader and former business secretary, said the executive pay register would contribute little because the information was already available and that the new code would be voluntary for large private companies. \u201cThe overblown rhetoric from Theresa May is completely at odds with the weakness of the new rules,\u201d he said. The plans will also oblige large listed companies \u201cto publicly explain how their directors take employees\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 interests into account\u201d and to make public policies on responsible business. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said: \u201cOne of Britain\u2019s biggest assets in competing in the global economy is our deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place in which to do business. Our legal system, our framework of company law and our standards of corporate governance have long been admired around the world. \u201cWe have maintained such a reputation by keeping our corporate governance framework under review. Today\u2019s reforms will build on our strong reputation and ensure our largest companies are more transparent and accountable to their employees and shareholders.\u201d Stephen Martin, the head of the IoD, said his organisation welcomed \u201cthe pragmatic approach the government is taking to improve how company boards work\u201d. He said Clark was \u201ctaking a sensible approach on giving workers a bigger say, by allowing companies to choose the best way to implement the new rules\u201d. Paul Drechsler, the CBI president, said: \u201cWe know that how companies act and behave determines the way people think about business. Companies take this seriously and we look forward to working closely with the government to ensure the UK maintains its reputation as a global leader in this field and as a primary location for international investment. \u201cThe CBI is very clear that the unacceptable behaviour of a few does not reflect the high standards and responsible behaviour of the vast majority of companies.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
