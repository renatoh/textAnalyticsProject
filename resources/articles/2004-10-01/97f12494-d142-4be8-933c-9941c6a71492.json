Tall, dark, dashing and laconic, he was a true hero of his time, a second world war fighter-bomber pilot who represented Victoria at Australian rules football and became the greatest all-rounder Test cricket had ever seen. A fast bowler who could also deliver testing off-spin and a powerful and aggressive bat, he was chosen at No6 in Australia's \"team of the century\". \"He was the finest all-rounder I came into contact with,\" said the 92-year-old former Australia captain Bill Brown yesterday. \" .\" \"He could do anything,\" said Neil Harvey, a team-mate in the all-conquering Australian team that toured England in 1948. \"He changed games quicker than anyone I knew. He was a freak. You talk about his hitting, but if he'd had the modern-day bats they'd have never found the balls he hit.\" \"He was very good to me and I learned more from him than anyone else,\" said Richie Benaud, the commentator who played with Miller for Australia and New South Wales. \"He had more charisma than any other cricketer or sportsman I've seen.\" Miller relished sport without allowing it overwhelming importance - a perspective that may have owed something to surviving the war. Pressure, he once told Michael Parkinson, was \"having a Messerschmitt up your arse\". He was a playboy who canoodled with Princess Margaret, among others, then became a devoted family man. And he was a music lover who on returning from a mission in his Mosquito took an unauthorised detour over Bonn in order to look upon Ludwig van Beethoven's birthplace. \"Outstanding as he was at cricket,\" wrote the commentator and Guardian correspondent John Arlott, \"the game was for him only a part of living life as a man might do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
