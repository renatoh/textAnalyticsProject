I need the hat-trick!\u201d shouts Aitch, fully aware he could ask almost anything of his teenage Glasgow fans. They scream as if they\u2019ve just hit the drop on a rollercoaster. The Manchester rapper is rounding out an unbelievable 12 months. Aitch \u2013 AKA Harrison Armstrong \u2013 turns 20 next week and has had three top 10 hits this year, including Taste (Make It Shake) which reached No 2. Despite the sharp rise to fame, he looks at ease. Strolling up and down the stage, twirling a finger as he raps, Aitch\u2019s deceptively laid-back bars are crammed with 0161 area code in-jokes and sharp tongue-twisters, bringing bags of character to nondescript trap beats. DJ Win, head of the Northern Quarterz talent agency that represents Aitch, bounces next to him, whipping his shirt over his head. Aitch preaches his work ethic on breakthrough track Straight Rhymez \u2013 \u201cDad says there\u2019s not a lift up to success\u201d \u2013 but mostly his tracks are full of teenage innuendo, detailing conquests (\u201cEat it like a Creme Egg,\u201d he smirks on Weekday) with the hopeful tone of a Christmas wishlist. Croydon rapper ZieZie joins him for their pleasingly naff single French Kisses and stays for Buss Down, a breezy number prefaced with a silly skit about getting the bus to Glasgow. He describes his 2018 freestyle for the Daily Duppy series as \u201ctaking it old-school\u201d, cracking a grin as he nails it \u2013 little surprise that last year feels a lifetime ago for the rapper \u2013 and he jumps straight into his \u201cManny\u201d-repping verse on Stormzy and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Take Me Back to London remix. Taste (Make It Shake) would have been an easy and triumphant closer, but instead he opts for the low-key single Wait, suggesting that for Aitch, it\u2019s all still to play for: \u201cI won\u2019t let it go to waste, trust me.\u201d \u2022 At Concorde 2, Brighton, 10 December. Then touring until 19 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
