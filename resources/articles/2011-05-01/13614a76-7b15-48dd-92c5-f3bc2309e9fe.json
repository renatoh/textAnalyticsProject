Is sending an invite to professional Islamic controversialist Anjem Choudary one of them? The organisers of the festival How the Light Gets In, which runs parallel to Hay next week, are about to find out. For many advantages accrue from putting Choudary \u2013 proponent of sharia law in Britain and once an acolyte of the notorious Omar Bakri \u2013 on two panels debating female equality and terrorism, as the festival organisers plan to do. The prospect of a memorable confrontation between Choudary and others. And lots of publicity. But there are downsides. You make enemies; in this case opposition has been triggered by angry sorts within Ukip who have been busy writing to the event's sponsors, including the Independent, demanding Choudary be disinvited. But it doesn't end with Ukip, for the little Englanders have made noise enough to bring the event to the attention of English Defence League types, who indicate that they too might fancy a typically boisterous day out in Herefordshire. Both Choudary and festival director Hilary Lawson insist they are keen to go ahead, but organisers must now assess with police the potential for public disorder. \"At this stage, we believe our original decision was the right one,\" Lawson told us. Will it go ahead? A lot can happen in a week. \u2022 The free speech card is a pretty strong one, and quite understandably the organisers are playing it. Unsurprising nevertheless that some might make a fuss at Choudary being given his place among the thinkers and philosophers. When activists took to the streets the other day to bemoan the shooting of Osama bin Laden, Choudary was the noisiest of them. But then, as the irrepressible Choudary told us yesterday, many all over the world join him in lamenting Bin Laden's passing, not least the al-Qaida leader's relatives who continue to insist the killing was illegal. Eric Holder, Obama's attorney general, says it was perfectly legal, and last week justified the shooting on the basis that under the laws of war, the slaying of the enemy commander is quite permissible. Is that true, we asked Geoffrey Robertson QC. No, he said. \"Only when the commander is in the field. Other than that, it's legal language creep.\" Some commanders bestride the battlefield. Others opt for a blanket and the telly. \u2022 Still, the administration's interpretation of the laws of war does take us into interesting territory. For Newt Gingrich, now a Republican nominee for the presidency, has described Mr WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, as an enemy combatant, as has his party colleague Sarah Palin. Does that not make the man who leaked the secrets a prime candidate for the sort of justice meted out to Bin Laden? Mr Wiki looks secure in that stately home near Norwich it is true, but then Bin Laden once seemed unreachable. Lahore or rural Norfolk: to navy seals with guns, they are about the same. \u2022 A terrible time, meanwhile, for the LSE; think of those embarrassing links with Colonel Gaddafi and the resignation of much loved director Howard Davies. Little wonder that the high-ups saw fit to equip staff with a little red pamphlet telling them what to do in an emergency. At the back it lists government websites to which one might usefully turn. Someone thought the www.preparingforemergencies.co.uk was one of them. It isn't. \"In an effort to worry the public and convince them to vote for us again next year, and because George Bush asked us to, this website includes the common sense advice found in the Preparing for Emergencies booklet,\" it says. It's a spoof. Amusing, but in extremis, hardly helpful. \u2022 Finally, will Bob Dylan be given the freedom of Haringey to mark his 70th birthday on 24 May? For Dylan, according to the local trades council, has had a long association with the north London borough, through his links with Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics. At one stage, proponents say, Bob was \"reputed to be thinking of relocating to Crouch End\". It didn't happen, but it could have, and if it had, he would have been a local resident. Lucky man. A Grammy, and now this. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 May 2011. The original referred to Lahore or rural Suffolk. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
