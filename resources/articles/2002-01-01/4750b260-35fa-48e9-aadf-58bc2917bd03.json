The Pillar Chase at Cheltenham on January 26 and the Aon Chase at Newbury two weeks later are obvious targets, but Marlborough will need to impress wherever he goes if he is to advance significantly in the ante-post betting. After an unbeaten campaign last season culminating in Sandown's Tote Gold Trophy - the so-called substitute Gold Cup - Marlborough was seen as a prime candidate for the real thing back at Cheltenham in March. Horses that stay at home are easily forgotten, however, and there are now eight names ahead of Marlborough's in the ante-post lists. \"He did plenty of work on our grass gallops and went very, very well,\" the Lambourn-based Henderson said yesterday, and if anyone can get a horse ready for Cheltenham after one, or at most two, runs, he is the man. \"What he had [a trapped epiglottis] was one of those rare and frustrating things that hopefully doesn't recur. He hasn't really missed a day and he could have either one or two races before the Festival. He was always going to go there fresh because he's not a horse we need to do a lot of work with.\" At this stage, the Gold Cup looks as tricky as any of the meeting's handicaps, and as Phil Smith, the British Horseracing Board's senior jumps handicapper, pointed out yesterday, one could easily back six horses in the race and still not have the winner. At the best prices currently available it is 7-1 the field, with no fewer than 11 horses at 16-1 or less. Smith was speaking at a lunch in London to promote the Singer &amp; Friedlander National Trial at Uttoxeter on February 2, where Stan Clarke, the course's chairman, also outlined the latest plans for his novice chaser, Barton. Though he holds an entry in races at both Ascot and Warwick this weekend, it seems likely that Barton will run instead in the Dipper Novice Chase at Newcastle the same afternoon. Barton's target at the Festival seems less certain - Clarke's suggestion that he may be entered in the Champion Hurdle was surely tongue-in-cheek - but the Arkle Trophy might just be an option for a horse currently a 12-1 chance for the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Chase. The BHB's senior members gather at Portman Square today for their first board meeting of 2002, a year which could redefine racing in Britain. A decisive moment in the struggle with the bookmakers is fast approaching and Peter Savill, the board chairman, last night used a speech to the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association to warn any waverers in his own ranks to think again. \"I must warn you,\" he said, \"that the betting industry has already targeted one or two people whom they believe will come to their rescue, people who have, in subtle ways, already indicated that they are willing to wave the white flag as their knees turn to jelly at the thought of standing firm. \"I have a message for those few. Do not even think of subverting the democratic process as has happened in the past.\" The Lingfield stewards were at the centre of controversy yesterday when they demoted Dispol Evita from first place in the card's second-last race, a one-mile seller. The 4-5 favourite looked a comfortable half-length winner in the hands of Martin Dwyer from Battle Line despite interfering with Jimmy Fortune's mount inside the final furlong. The stewards ruled that while the interference was accidental it had improved Dispol Evita's placing and so declared Battle Line the 10-1 winner. Dwyer, who was not found guilty of any riding offence, said: \"I am disappointed. The rule, as I understand it, is that if they are going to take a race off a horse they have to be certain that the horse that was interfered with would have beaten it. \"My horse was by far the best horse in the race. I only won half-a-length because she also ran on Saturday and I didn't want to give her a hard time. I could have won five or six lengths had I really got into her.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
