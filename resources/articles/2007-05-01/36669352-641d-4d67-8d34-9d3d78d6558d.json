The Championship ambitions of a side who 10 years ago were busy being solid if unspectacular in the Conference may have seemed far-fetched even before last night's damning home defeat by Forest. Now they appear little more than make-believe after the visitors, whose feted history is a mirror reverse of Yeovil's, took full advantage of two penalty decisions. The Forest midfielder James Perch had a hand in both of them, winning the first after 22 minutes and scoring the second in the 90th after Terrell Forbes had brought down Jack Lester. Yeovil were close to equalising many times in between but came up against a goalkeeper, Paul Smith, in defiant mood. The Yeovil manager, Russell Slade, felt the initial award by the referee, Nigel Miller, was at best harsh. \"I had to look at the first penalty twice but Nigel Miller didn't,\" he said. \"I don't know how we can get on the front foot next week any more than we did tonight but that is what we have to do. We have to regroup and come up with a game plan and be positive. Whatever happens we need to score first. That's absolutely crucial.\" Forest's manager, Colin Calderwood, pretended there was something left in this tie. \"There's a lot to work on in terms of not letting Yeovil upset the odds, because obviously the odds are stacked in our favour. We will be ready but we'll not expect anything other than a really tough game.\" Yeovil's determination to pour forward from the off had almost brought reward when, in the eighth minute, Arron Davies timed his run through the centre circle to coincide with Lee Morris's swivelled pass and it took a smart save from Smith to deny him. But the home side's commitment to committing men forward created space for Forest's midfielders and the Glovers were duly punished when Nathan Jones's clumsy lunge on Perch allowed Kris Commons to sidefoot the spot-kick into the right corner of Steve Mildenhall's goal. Perhaps buoyed by a sense of injustice the home side came back with determination after half-time. Headers from Wayne Gray and Marcus Stewart went narrowly wide before the former saw a nod back across goal palmed to safety by Smith. Stewart then hit the post with another header but moments later came the hammer blow at the other end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
