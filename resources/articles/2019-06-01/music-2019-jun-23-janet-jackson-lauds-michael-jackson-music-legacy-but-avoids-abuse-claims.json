Two men, James Safechuck and Wade Robson, made detailed allegations of sexual abuse by Michael Jackson in a documentary, Leaving Neverland. The singer died 10 years ago this month. Janet Jackson, 53, supported her brother throughout the child sexual abuse allegations, which he denied before his death. The two siblings also sang a duet on the 1995 hit Scream, a track that retaliated against media coverage of the claims, which had first emerged two years earlier. When asked about her brother\u2019s legacy in an interview with the Sunday Times magazine, she said: \u201cIt will continue. I love it when I see kids emulating him, when adults still listen to his music. \u201cIt just lets you know the impact that my family has had on the world. I hope I\u2019m not sounding arrogant in any way. I\u2019m just stating what is. It\u2019s really all God\u2019s doing, and I\u2019m just thankful for that.\u201d Members of the Jackson family, including Michael\u2019s brothers Tito and Marlon and his nephew Taj, resolutely denied the allegations made in Leaving Neverland, which was directed by Dan Reed. They drew a mixed reaction from the singer\u2019s friends and fans, some of whom claimed the programme, which aired in the UK on Channel 4, was \u201call about the money\u201d. Discussing growing up in one of the world\u2019s most famous families, Janet said her father, Joseph, had insisted his children had music careers and refused to allow her to study business law because he saw musical talent in her. \u201cWhen parents see something in their children, I guess they guide them in that direction,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re talking about children who grew up in that urban area. Music was a way to keep us off the streets. \u201cMy father saw a way out for his children. A better life. And thank God for that.\u201d Janet Jackson went on to sell millions of records and become one of the most successful female solo acts of all time. She will make her Glastonbury festival debut next weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
