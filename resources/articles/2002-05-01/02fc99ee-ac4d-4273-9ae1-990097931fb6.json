Woods' victory came at the third extra hole after Montgomerie hit his second shot out of the bunker into a lake, as the two men went up the 18th hole for the fourth time in a row. Earlier, Woods and Montgomerie had finished tied on 20-under-par 268, with Justin Rose, who was seeking his fourth victory of the season, a shot further back. Despite a sleepless night caused by his back injury, Montgomerie managed to birdie the first two holes to stretch his advantage from one to three. The 38-year-old Scot added another on the next, but defending champion Woods holed a 20-foot eagle putt and was back to only one behind when Montgomerie bogeyed the short fifth. Each of them then parred the following four holes to turn in 34, leaving Montgomerie 19 under par and the world number one 18 under. The two continued to trade birdies and the lead on the back nine, with Woods holing from eight feet to force a sudden death play-off. Woods had a 14-foot chance to win on the first hole of the play-off and thought he had it, but the ball lipped out. The second extra hole did not settle it either, with both players making par after missing the green to the right. But on the third play-off hole, the match was finally settled when Montgomerie, having hit his drive into a fairway bunker, went from there into the lake short of the 18th green. He double-bogeyed and Woods got up and down for par to win the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open for the third time in four years. For Montgomerie, though, there was the satisfaction that he had stretched the world No 1 to the limit - and had done so with a back problem which he said would have led to his withdrawal if he had not been in contention. Montgomerie had been on the driving range nearly two hours before the final round - but that was not the good sign it might at first have appeared. \"It's not good,\" he said, \"and I'm here early because I've been advised to keep moving rather than sit still. \"I didn't sleep. I spent the night pacing the room because I was worried about it tightening right up. \"If I was two under I wouldn't be here, but all I can do is give it my best. I'm just patting the ball, though, and losing distance because of it. I've taken so many pain-killing tablets by now that my body is rattling. \"I've been given an ice pack to put on my back between shots and I'm allowed one five-minute time-out during the round, but I'm in trouble basically,\" he added, before going out and testing Woods to the limit.
