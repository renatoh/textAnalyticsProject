Richards, the chairman of Prodrive and the sportscar maker Aston Martin and a former head of the Benetton and BAR teams, was giving a keynote address before Sunday's Bahrain grand prix. \"From next year this region will have six world-class racing circuits,\" he said. \"It shows that the Gulf has become a significant focal point for the motor-sport industry. The business model of a stand-alone circuit is gone forever,\" added Richards, who fronted a group that bought Aston Martin from Ford last year with Kuwait's Investment Dar taking a 50% stake. \"This area of the world is looking at motor sport as a proper sustainable business plan and we should all pay attention.\" Bahrain became formula one's first Middle Eastern circuit in 2004 and Abu Dhabi will host a race next year. Dubai also has a modern circuit and Qatar plans to upgrade its Losail track, which hosted a night MotoGP race last month, to formula one standard. Abu Dhabi has linked its circuit with a Ferrari World amusement park, Bahrain is planning a technology centre at Sakhir, and Dubai's Autodrome is part of the Emirate's MotorCity development. Abu Dhabi's government-owned Mubadala Development Company has a 5% stake in Ferrari and sponsors the team with Etihad Airways of the United Arab Emirates. McLaren are 30% owned by Bahrain's Mumtalakat Holding Company. In the build-up to Sunday's grand prix, Nelson Piquet Jr has admitted his first season in formula one, with Renault, has been tougher than he expected. \"Without a doubt, formula one is a lot harder than I imagined,\" said the Brazilian, who is looking to win his first points at the third attempt. He was Renault's test driver last year and is partnering Fernando Alonso this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
