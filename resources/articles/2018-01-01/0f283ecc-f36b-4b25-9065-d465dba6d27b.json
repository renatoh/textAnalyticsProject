This week came the news that before the 2016 election, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison were making claims about the impact of the Labor party\u2019s negative gearing policy that directly contradicted advice from the Treasury. This was followed on Thursday by Fairfax revealing that the New South Wales government had ignored the advice of its own treasury department that negative gearing was pushing up house prices. Negative gearing is the economic equivalent of a migrant crime story \u2013 something conservative political parties believe they can use to scare voters despite little or no relation to facts. And the facts certainly show that the ALP\u2019s policy of limiting negative gearing to new housing and halving the capital gains discount will produce little to be scared about. Those who will most be affected, according to the treasury department, come from the top 20% \u2013 and that might give some insight into why conservative political parties and media organisations cling to the policy. To be honest, it was always pretty obvious that what Turnbull was saying about the ALP\u2019s housing policy would have made some pretty powerful fertiliser. The prime minister, for example, in April that year referred to the ALP\u2019s policy as a \u201chousing tax\u201d that was \u201ca big sledgehammer they are taking to the property market\u201d that would \u201cdevalue every home, every property, in Australia\u201d. Yep. Every home. Every property. And while at the time it was clear his assertions lacked rigor, we now know he too knew this. A briefing document, first produced under FOI to the ABC this week, revealed that the Treasury had advised the government that the ALP\u2019s housing policy might merely cause \u201csome downward pressure on property prices\u201d in the short term and that in the long term it could have \u201ca relatively modest downward impact\u201d on prices. That the Treasury was advising the government of this should not be a shock, and neither is discovering that the prime minister and treasurer were scaremongering and ignoring advice. Such news is merely \u2013 to use a favourite expression of the prime minister\u2019s \u2013 a penetrating glimpse of the obvious. Turnbull also suggested Labor\u2019s policy would affect commercial property despite the Treasury saying it wouldn\u2019t. Whereas the prime minister told the Australian public that \u201cwhat Labor clearly wants is for there to be less investment in Australia because they are jacking up the tax on investment\u201d, the Treasury advised that \u201cin fact the impact of the policy on investments in other asset classes, such as shares, may see investment in owner-occupier housing increase\u201d. That the prime minister and treasurer have been found to ignore advice is a worry, but it is pleasing to discover that at least their idiotic ramblings on the issue were not based on advice from the Treasury. Most likely the next step for the government \u2013 one already earmarked by conservative media outlets such as the Australian \u2013 will be to argue that the advice shows the ALP\u2019s policy is pointless because it won\u2019t have a big impact. No doubt they will shift to the impact on rents and argue that while it may not smash house prices it will (to quote the prime minister from his April 2016 doorstop) \u201cdrive up rents\u201d. Fortunately, here we don\u2019t need to wait on another FOI request of Treasury advice, because we already have such advice based on evidence. In the 1980s, when the Hawke government did remove negative gearing, the impact on rental prices was decidedly mixed \u2013 they increased in Sydney and Perth but stayed flat elsewhere. And the release of the 1987 cabinet papers four years ago revealed that the Treasury then advised the Hawke government that the increase in rental prices in Sydney and Perth was because \u201clocal influences rather than tax measures dominate in metropolitan rental markets\u201d. Essentially, before the removal of negative gearing in 1985, there was a shortage of rental accommodation in Sydney and Perth, and that was why rents rose in just those two cities. But I doubt such facts will matter \u2013 they certainly haven\u2019t bothered the prime minister or treasurer so far. Neither will, I suspect, a study presented at a Reserve Bank conference, which found that the removal of negative gearing (something the ALP is not even proposing) would \u201clead to an overall welfare gain of 1.5% for the Australian economy in which 76% of households become better off\u201d. That study, which argues increases in rent could be more than offset by increased government transfers coming from more tax revenue, suggest the winners of removing negative gearing would be \u201crenters and owner-occupiers\u201d but \u201clandlords, especially young with high earning landlords, lose\u201d. This is in agreement with the Treasury\u2019s assessment that \u201cnegative gearing benefits high income families\u201d and that the capital gains tax discount \u201coverwhelmingly benefits high income families\u201d. Once again, this is not new \u2013 given the publicly available tax data to argue that anything else requires one to be relatively unconcerned about facts. And facts are not the government\u2019s strong suit on this issue. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist \u2022 On 15 January 2018 this column was amended.
