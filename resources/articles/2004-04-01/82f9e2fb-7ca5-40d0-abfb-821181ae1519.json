In 1999, when he won his second US Masters title, it was there that a confrontation with Greg Norman in the final round kept him in the hunt for victory. And yesterday it was at the same hole that Olazabal felt the stirring of old glory once again. An hour later he was going into the scorer's hut two shots off the lead and anticipating an interesting weekend. Olazabal is now 38 and has won only four tournaments in the last five years. But Augusta National, where he came second in 1991, won for the first time in 1994, finished fourth two years ago and has seven other top-20 finishes in his 16 previous appearances, is his happiest hunting ground. \"I think there's something about the place that gets him fired up,\" Davis Love III, one of his playing partners, said after yesterday's round. \"He knows that he has a chance here as soon as he pulls through the gates.\" On Thursday the Spaniard compiled an efficient but unspectacular round of 71. But one of his three birdies, significantly, was at the 13th, the last hole of the trio collectively known as Amen Corner. Yesterday he was trundling along at level par when he came to the par-five 13th, christened Azalea for the profusion of blooms lining Rae's Creek, which runs along its left-hand boundary. No other hole offers Augusta's patrons such a panorama of golf, requiring as it does a mighty drive, a brave approach and a delicate putting touch, all unfolding within the gaze of a vast gallery. \"It was a quiet round for me today until that hole,\" Olazabal said. \"I hit driver and three-iron, two lovely shots, and gave myself an eagle chance from 35 or 40ft. I made that and I made another nice putt at 14, and hit a lovely shot at 15, and that was my round.\" The eagle - his third at the hole in 60 rounds at Augusta National - and two birdies took him to five under par for the tournament, zipping him up the leaderboard. He flirted with another birdie at the short 16th, when his 15ft putt from the fringe of the green took a big right to left break and curled away just below the hole. Off the 17th tee he completely mishit his drive, the ball whirring past the gallery at head height like a bird with a broken wing. Narrowly missing the Eisenhower Tree, a Georgia pine which habitually got in the way of the late US president's tee shot, it landed below a smaller pine a few yards further up the hill. Fretting about the overhanging branches, Olazabal took his two-iron and contrived a beautiful recovery, smacking a low shot 220 yards to the green and two-putting for par from 25ft. His drive at the mountainous 18th was again less than full blooded, and his second shot from a difficult position found the heart of the bunker to the right of the green. \"It's a tough hole,\" he said. \"And when you're standing there with a four-iron in your hand and an elevated green up ahead, it's even tougher.\" He splashed out to 10ft but his putt kissed the lip of the hole to deny him a closing par and pull him back to four under for the tournament. At the BellSouth Classic in Atlanta last week, where he finished in a tie for 45th place, Olazabal had not seemed confident about his chances in the Masters. \"I don't feel much different now to how I felt last week,\" he said last night. \"Parts of the game are pretty much the same. The putting has not been great, apart from the two or three putts that I made today. The driving has been average. I managed to hit more fairways than not but the quality of the shots off the tee is not what it should be for this course.\" Nor does he feel the course suits him as well as it did. \"The years are going by and the course is changing a lot,\" he said. \"I think now you need to be a really long hitter of the ball to do well around here. But apart from that, a real knowledge of the course is a great point in favour of a player.\" He certainly seemed at home yesterday and ready to take advantage of it. \"He's very relentless,\" Davis Love concluded. \"It doesn't really matter what kind of shots he hits or where his ball is, he still gets after it and never gives up. That certainly is fun to watch. You can really appreciate a guy who is that focused. And he was very, very focused today.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
