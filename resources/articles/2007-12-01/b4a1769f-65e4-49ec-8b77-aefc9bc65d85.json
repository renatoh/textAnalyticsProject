This wide-eyed skip across America resembles nothing so much as Dorothy's journey along the Yellow Brick Road, as Frei meets a string of unlikely characters in a bewildering world. \"We're off,\" he declares, \"to see the media revolution at work!\" Or, if you prefer, \"to spend some quality time with the sans- culottes who are smashing the icons\". Will and Rob are two youngish New Yorkers who produce an online video briefing called Political Lunch; \"Pundit Mom\" blogs about weighty issues from her kitchen on the outskirts of Washington DC. Will and Rob's largest-ever audience was 10,000 viewers, but Frei is both delighted and terrified at the threat they and their peers pose to traditional, resource-intensive media. \"Somewhere,\" as the old-school broadcaster Dan Rather puts it, \"there need to be professional journalists who spend their time trying to separate brass tacks from bullfeathers.\" You can almost hear Frei nodding along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
