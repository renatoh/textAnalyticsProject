Fratton Park, with the most primitive facilities in the Premiership, is a place for stoics and football archaeologists. But this is the new home for two of the most celebrated Gunners of them all, Tony Adams, Portsmouth's new assistant manager, and Sol Campbell, who purred with nonchalant authority in the middle of their defence here on Saturday. And it was another Highbury old boy, Nwankwo Kanu, whose goals placed the club on top of the Premiership on that evening. This is a side that should not be fighting relegation this season. When asked what Campbell thought about Portsmouth's prehistoric shower facilities, manager Harry Redknapp replied: \"I said to Sol, 'I can remember you playing at Hackney Marshes - what are you worried about?' Patrik Berger, Teddy Sheringham and Paul Merson were all used to the best but they all got on with it and roughed it. It's all part of the attraction of being here.\" The pairing of Campbell and Linvoy Primus in the middle of defence, with Glen Johnson, on loan from Chelsea, at right-back, in front of a new goalkeeper, David James, gave Portsmouth easy command against a disappointing Blackburn side. Redknapp is a dextrous handler of big-name players and Campbell could go down as one of his most important signings. \"Top class,\" was how he described him on Saturday night. \"I've know him since he was 15. He's an East Ham boy and I've followed his career. I know all about Sol, how he started as a striker. \"He was great today and he hasn't come here for the money. He walked away from a contract at Arsenal - for whatever reason - worth God knows how many millions. He wants to play. I told him 'You'll love it here. The fans will love you. Come and enjoy your football. \"Today must have given him a big lift. No matter what you've done in the game, if you get 20,000 people singing your name and making him feel welcome, it's got to be good for him. \"When you look at the load of crap they brought in last pre-season, we've bought some quality. You need experience. People go on about older players but look at what Lawrie McMenemy did up the road [at Southampton] when they had a good side. He brought in proper players, who had been there, like Alan Ball.\" The contribution of Adams is more difficult to assess but according to Redknapp he will be more than a back-four coach. \"At first that's what I asked him to do but I don't think he likes to be pigeon-holed. He works with me and Joe [Jordan] and we all do our bit.\" Adams messed up at Wycombe, not least when he refused to concede that the club would be relegated even when it was a mathematical certainty. Redknapp feels he deserves another chance: \"A lot of great players get written off early. They have one crack at management and then get cast aside because they've gone to the wrong club. \"Bobby Moore did that. He went to Southend and suddenly they said Bobby couldn't be a manager. How could they? He never got a chance to manage a club where he had a real chance. I was at Oxford City with Bobby. He could have been the best manager West Ham had ever had if he's been given the job. \"Here's a chance for Tony to bounce back. I'd love him to become the manager here one day.\" It was one of the more familiar names at Fratton Park who put Portsmouth ahead in the 26th minute, Svetoslav Todorov sweeping in the cross from Benjani Mwaruwari, whose own fumblings in front of goal evoked uneasy memories of last season. Todorov made way for Kanu 15 minutes into the second half and the Nigerian scored two minutes later, nodding home a Sean Davis cross at the far post. Another headed goal by Kanu, seven minutes from the end, this time from a Gary O'Neil cross, settled the matter. He should have had a hat-trick, but he missed his penalty and headed the rebound tamely wide. He said afterwards: \"Sol and Tony and me all know each other from our old club and it makes it easy for us. It's not like everything is new. I wanted to go and play in Germany or Spain but Harry came knocking, so I said yes.\" \"Kanu was brilliant,\" Blackburn's Benni McCarthy said afterwards. \"He's been around the block for quite a while but is still a quality striker.\" Blackburn, who had Lucas Neill and Andy Todd sent off, did not seem to have a quality striker of their own. Last season the pace and finishing of Craig Bellamy made up for a number of ordinary displays and the striker, now at Liverpool, will be difficult to replace.
