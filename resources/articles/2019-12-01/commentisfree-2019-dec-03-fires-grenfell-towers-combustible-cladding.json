As we walked towards the burnt-out wreckage of The Cube in Bolton, it took me straight back to Grenfell Tower the morning after the fire that killed my niece and 71 others. Two and a half years since Grenfell, it is a silent scandal how little has changed. The images of the cladding crackling and dripping from the Bolton student block is a shameful reminder that thousands of homes are still not safe. There have been eight significant residential fires since Grenfell. And today tens of thousands of people are still living in buildings wrapped in dangerous combustible materials. It\u2019s on our homes, our hospitals, our care homes and our schools. It still keeps me awake at night worrying that what happened to my family could happen to another. That\u2019s why Grenfell United, the pressure group for survivors and the bereaved, has written a letter to party leaders that we never wanted to write. We have told them that unless action is taken it is our firm belief that a serious fire in the UK will occur in a building wrapped in combustible materials, leading to loss of life. Edward Daffarn, also a Grenfell United member, made a similarly stark warning on his co-authored Grenfell Action blog six months before the fire. It was not listened to. This time I pray our words will not be ignored. We are still fighting the indifference that led to the Grenfell tragedy. For the past two years we\u2019ve heard from successive government ministers that local authorities should step in, or building owners or developers. All this means is that little gets done, and that residents remain living in fear. The truth is that residents are in far greater danger than the government has wanted to admit. It\u2019s not just about the type of cladding that was on Grenfell: other types are dangerous too. Focus has been on buildings over 18 metres high, but that height is arbitrary. The Cube was just under 18 metres. Addressing the problem starts with being honest about how many buildings are affected, and so far the government hasn\u2019t even been able to do that. But there is a way forward. Residents\u2019 groups, including UK Cladding Action Group and Manchester Cladiators, point to lessons from Australia. When there was a cladding fire in Melbourne, the government took control, set up a national taskforce, prioritised every building at risk, and has even brought in a new development levy so the construction industry bears some of the costs. None of these things have happened in Britain. If the government\u2019s main job is to keep citizens safe, taking responsibility for the cladding scandal must be top of the list. That another Grenfell could happen under the next government should keep any prime minister awake at night. We were made many promises in the aftermath of Grenfell. The most important promise is that we will see justice. Seeing the Hillsborough families devastatingly let down by the criminal justice system last week, we are all too aware of the long journey to justice ahead of us and the flawed system we face. The Hillsborough families have fought with incredible dignity, courage and determination for more than three decades. We walk in their footsteps. Justice for Grenfell can come in three ways: through the inquiry seeking the truth; through the criminal prosecutions seeking charges; or through change led by the government. We have already waited for two and a half years with countless undelivered promises. It\u2019s time for justice to start. A new government must lead the change. There are many wrongs to right from Grenfell but they all start with listening to residents and making sure warnings are not ignored. It means ending this culture of indifference and complacency. Next year my twin girls will apply to university. When I pack them off, I want to know they will be safe in their halls. I want to know that people across the country are safe \u2013 because residents have been listened to and our warnings heeded. I want to know I will never again smell the acrid burning of toxic materials. We owe it to the 72 people who died in the Grenfell fire to make sure it never happens again. \u2022 Sandra Ruiz is a member of the Grenfell United action group"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
