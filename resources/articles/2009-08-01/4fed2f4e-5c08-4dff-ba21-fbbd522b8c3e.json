Mark Hughes, the City manager, remains determined to supplement the capture of Kolo Tour\u00e9 from Arsenal with that of Everton's Joleon Lescott or another centre-half from his list of targets, which includes Matthew Upson of West Ham United. Hughes tried and failed earlier in the summer to sign John Terry from Chelsea, and Dunne, four times City's player of the season, fears the writing is on the wall. But Trapattoni, Dunne's manager at international level with the Republic of Ireland, believes the 29-year-old will emerge after the closure of the transfer window with his place at Eastlands intact. Trapattoni has a vested interest in hoping this is the case; he wants all his players to enjoy regular football with their clubs as he attempts to guide Ireland to the World Cup finals in South Africa next summer. \"City is not my job, it's the job of Mark Hughes, the coach, my friend, and it's a tough job to choose the positions,\" said Trapattoni. \"But for me, there are too many offensive players. I think Richard is strong, he plays well. He will get stronger and I am sure he will keep his place in the team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
