It was conceived by an odd but stable couple. Donald Dewar and John Smith met at Glasgow University, their passion moulded in the students' union and brought to maturity in the intense struggles of Labour's wilderness years. They rejected displays of nationalist fervour, but shared the certainty that Scotland's particular legal, cultural and educational traditions deserved recognition within the UK state. It was a sophisticated faith, moulded by long years of experience in Scottish and Westminster politics. Each was convinced that a democratic deficit existed in the UK constitution and that measured reform could fill it without posing any threat to the union. Smith's death left Dewar with an awesome responsibility; one he discharged with customary courage and ruthless attention to detail. Scotland got her parliament, and Dewar guided its first faltering steps. But then, three months ago, Dewar died too and Scotland was bereft. His absence hurts not because Dewar was universally loved; he was not. But because his was the mind that squared the circle. From the binary paradigm in which the solution was either independence or the unreformed status quo, Dewar created a synthesis that was, theoretically, greater than the sum of its parts. Now, in his place is Henry McLeish. If he really understands the Dewar legacy, he has not shown it. He appears weak and uncertain; a man whose awkward command of the English language has made his opening weeks as first minister difficult, at times humiliating. He can hardly be looking forward to the new year's introductory session of first minister's questions today, particularly because his cavalier suggestion that his Scottish executive deserves to be renamed a government has earned him a rebuke from Downing Street, and contempt from Scottish Labour MPs at Westminster. Critics have suggested Dewar was unsure about how to use his creation, citing the first year of devolved government, which often looked dithering and incompetent. Dewar must shoulder some blame for that. He had not expended sufficient intellectual energy on how devolution might improve Scotland. That was not his agenda. Dewar was intensely proud of Scotland. For him the constitutional project was about filling a perceived gap in the nature of British government. He rejected the view that his parliament and executive should reform Scottish institutions radically and he was widely criticised for his conservatism. Dewar was partially right. Not about the institutions: Scottish schools are failing and the legal system is institutionally corrupt; Scotland is socially reactionary, still terrified of the moral authority of the Catholic church and cringingly subservient to the power of vested interests in local government and public sector trades unions. But Dewar knew that a programme of radical reform might stir the nationalist sentiments he had opposed for four decades. Just 12 weeks after his death, his fears are already materialising. Devolution has not failed, but it has stalled. A recent publication, The State and the Nations: the first year of devolution in the United Kingdom, makes the case with acute accuracy. Edited by Professor Robert Hazell, director of the constitution unit at University College London, it argues that devolution is \"running on the spot\", that there is frustration in Scotland about the lack of progress, and that the public response has been to demand more powers for the Scottish parliament rather than subject it to a \"lingering death\". Compiled before Dewar died, this assessment would be even more pessimistic if it was commissioned today. Dewar believed he could overcome the instinct that would change devolution into independence. He did not underestimate it, but he understood it. So far the response to nationalism of his successor, McLeish, has been to flirt with it in the most dangerous way. McLeish's early weeks in office have been troubled. He is already known as a man less comfortable in his use of English than John Prescott and George W Bush. His assassination of grammar and syntax has given birth to a new phrase - the McLeich\u00e9. His claim in the Scottish parliament that \"there is only one party in this coalition\" reveals a blinkered tribalism. But McLeish's early sins of inexperience run deeper than clumsiness with words and allies. The leader nobody wanted is betraying Dewar's unionist legacy and some observers fear he cannot avoid what his predecessor would have considered disaster. Certainly, Dewar thought him mediocre and condemned McLeish brutally when he dared to suggest he might make a competent deputy leader of the Scottish Labour party. McLeish deserves little sympathy. He is a cynical machine-politician who compensates for his apparent lack of talent by nurturing ambitions for which he is unsuitable. He knew he would not have won three votes if he had contested the leadership against Dewar. Only when Dewar was dead could he launch his bid for the top. The Scottish Labour party does not deserve to be forgiven for allowing him to get away with it. Neither does the cabinet in London, which chose convenience over principle despite powerful advice not to. And now King Henry (as the newly fawning Daily Record has christened him) is methodically betraying Dewar's legacy. It is not that he is a nationalist. Just that he is ambitious and lacks the cleverness to present devolution as anything other than a half-way house to independence. And he has allowed his ministers to do the same. The Scottish executive is presenting itself as a national government. Jack McConnell, McLeish's defeated opponent in the leadership race, is promising to travel Europe speaking up for Scottish interests - as if devolved Scotland cannot depend on the UK Foreign Office to perform this role (as Dewar intended it should). Ministers in the Scottish executive regard Dublin as a second home and the first minister has also developed a taste for diplomatic travel. He was in Rome last month, performing for all the world like a national leader. His rhetoric is founded on the assumption that devolved government must identify uniquely \"Scottish solutions\" to \"Scottish problems\" - as if poor health, derelict housing, comprehensive education and violent crime are distinctly Scottish problems. McLeish rejects Dewar's confidence that radical reform should be implemented in partnership with London. He wants to go it alone, but appears to lack the ideas or courage to do it well. The SNP and the Scottish Tories are salivating. Dewar knew that too much talk of separate identity was fatal to his project. He perceived devolution as a primarily administrative solution. McLeish appears to want more independence. He has speculated about seeking more powers for the Scottish parliament, but there is insufficient proof that it has learned to use the ones it already has. He has expanded the number of ministers in the Scottish executive to a mind-boggling 22. How can it take so many to perform the roles just four performed pre-devolution? Isn't this a puerile pretence that Scotland's government is equal to the UK one? McLeish shows no indication of understanding the Dewar legacy. Yes, Scottish Labour won the two elections in Glasgow Anniesland occasioned by Dewar's death and just held Falkirk West in the face of a strong nationalist challenge, but it did so on the basis of the lowest turn-out in postwar Scottish history and by a crude refusal to debate with any of its opponents. Dewar was beginning to come to terms with the chasm which had opened up between devolutionary dream and devolutionary reality. His answer was brave, if depressing: to reduce expectation. He rejected the notion that his Scottish executive should win Scottish hearts and minds with a dramatic legislative programme. His programme for the second year of devolution was criticised by colleagues as lacklustre and unimaginitive. It was both. Dewar himself was neither, but he saw the consequences of attempting too much. Every step Scotland took to erect new differences with the rest of Britain risked reinforcing the nationalist case. Dewar would use his influence in London to promote good ideas. He would export thinking from Edinburgh to London. He would not talk up difference in order to bolster his own status. He did not need to. McLeish, meanwhile, is one of a generation of Scottish politicians who see their future in Scotland, not Britain. He did not serve in a British cabinet. McLeish's supporters in London believe he is parochial and bland enough to be compliant. Perhaps. But his first weeks in office and the crude briefing against Dewar by ministers in his new executive (they describe revising Dewar's incrementalism as \"Dumping the crap\") suggest something less pleasant - a man who would never have been appointed to a UK cabinet post who is nevertheless ambitious to create a power base of his own. Unionists who, like Smith and Dewar, supported the reversal of Scotland's democratic deficit hope McLeish will prove us wrong. He still has the time. But he will not do it by speaking the language of nationalism. Much as it may disappoint the flop of mediocrities who have decided to pursue power in Edinburgh, the Scottish executive was not created to be a national government. It was designed to administer a region of the UK and to strengthen the state by doing it well. That was not an impossible ideal but it did require a subtle mind to grasp it. With Dewar and Smith both dead there appear to be few such minds active in Labour politics - north or south of Hadrian's wall. McLeish has started by parading difference as valuable in its own right. Dewar would have called that playing with loaded pistols for no constructive purpose. \u0095 Tim Luckhurst is a former editor of the Scotsman.
