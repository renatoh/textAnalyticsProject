Retailing, hospitality and leisure make up around one-sixth of the economy\u2019s output and anybody working in one of those sectors is more at risk of losing their job, of being furloughed and of not having their government-supported wages topped up by their employers. The latest survey of earnings and hours worked from the Office for National Statistics illustrates starkly why so many of Britain\u2019s most vulnerable workers are fearful of a second lockdown, particularly if the restrictions drag on for more than a month. While 11% of all employees were furloughed on reduced pay in April \u2013 the month that registered the biggest contraction in the economy \u2013 that figure rose to 39% for those working in accommodation and food services. What\u2019s more, around half of the lowest-paid workers (paid \u00a38.72 an hour or less) were furloughed on reduced pay \u2013 compared with fewer than one in 20 higher-paid workers (paid \u00a315.87 an hour or more). So while the government\u2019s furlough scheme paid 80% of wages up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month, and was at least as generous as most comparable schemes in other countries, there was still a major income hit for those workers whose employers could not afford to make good the other 20%. As a result, around 2 million furloughed workers were being paid less than the \u00a38.72 an hour minimum wage. Clearly, a low-paid worker furloughed on 80% of their wages is a lot better off than someone who loses their job altogether, but life is still going to be a struggle. Older, higher-paid workers might have savings that they can draw upon, but the 21-year-old earning the minimum wage in a hotel is unlikely to have this option. The TUC has said Rishi Sunak should fix the furlough scheme to ensure that nobody ends up earning less than the minimum wage. Given the Treasury\u2019s reluctance to target particular sectors, it is highly improbable that the chancellor will go down this road. Sunak could, however, announce that he intends to increase welfare payments when they are next uprated in April, rather than take away the temporary \u00a320-a-week one-year boost to universal credit, which is the current default position for the government. Larry Elliott Is Nio the new Chinese Tesla? What\u2019s the most popular stock among small investors and day traders? Tesla? Amazon? Apple? Microsoft? According to trading platform eToro \u2013 which claims to have 16 million users globally \u2013 those are four out of the five most traded. But sitting at the very top among traders\u2019 affections is a small Chinese company the vast majority of people have never heard of. The company is called Nio, a six-year-old startup based in the city of Hefei in the eastern province of Anhui, which earlier this year needed a rescue financing package to tide it over during the coronavirus pandemic. Yet today the company is valued at $45bn (\u00a334bn) \u2013 more than Tesco and NatWest put together\u2013 and since March has given investors an extraordinary 1,400% return. No wonder day traders have been falling over themselves to buy. So what is Nio doing that has speculators so frantically bidding up the price? The magic word is \u201cEV\u201d. That stands for electric vehicle, and punters reckon Nio is China\u2019s answer to Tesla. Nio did not sell its first car until 2018, and even now is managing to sell only 5,000 a month in China, a country where more than 2m vehicles are sold every month. Yet Nio\u2019s stock market capitalisation (it is listed on the New York stock exchange) makes it far more valuable than Ford Motor Corporation, which last year produced 5.5m vehicles. Nio is also in the RobinHood 100, the hotlist of stocks on the hugely popular no-commission US trading platform. Speculators lap up stories that Nio is working on a 150 kWh battery that will let its cars go 559 miles on a single charge. Yet Nio still doesn\u2019t even have its own manufacturing plant, partnering with the Chinese state company JAC instead. Adam Vettese, analyst at eToro, says: \u201cNio\u2019s rise in the past year has been nothing short of phenomenal, particularly given the fact it was perilously close to running out of cash at the start of the year.\u201d Maybe Nio is the next Tesla. But it doesn\u2019t yet sell outside China, its technology is unlikely to be ahead of Tesla, let alone competitors in Germany, South Korea and Japan. China has said it wants new energy vehicles (NEVs) to account for 25% of car sales by 2025, up from around 5% currently. Nio may be among them, but there are plenty of domestic competitors that could brush it aside. Normally financial commentators are asked to recommend \u201cbuy\u201d, \u201csell\u201d or \u201chold\u201d. In Nio\u2019s case, \u201ctake your profits\u201d are the words that come to mind.
