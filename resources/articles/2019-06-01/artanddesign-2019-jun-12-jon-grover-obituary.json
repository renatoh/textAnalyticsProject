He was born in Eastbourne, East Sussex, to Jim, a salesman, and his wife, Georgina (nee Leitch). As a result of our father\u2019s work, the family moved around a great deal and Jon attended schools in Eastbourne, and Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where he participated and excelled in a range of sports, and Darlington, County Durham. He studied at St Martin\u2019s College of Art in London during an exciting period when it was located in Charing Cross Road. Jon took full advantage of the creative and social scene there during the 1970s. His early career was spent selling advertising space \u2013 Jon would call it \u201cadvertising concepts\u201d \u2013 for glossy magazines, including the first editions of Wedding Day; he then moved to designing and writing copy for corporate brochures, including for Olympic Holidays. Jon was always ambitious and driven and at different times he established his own design companies; the nature of the industry meant some were more successful than others. During a particularly buoyant period, he and his partners bought a large former bank building in south London and, as he described it to me at the time, spent \u201cshedloads\u201d of money converting the bank into offices, design studios, a photographic dark room and a spacious area for drinks and entertaining clients. Throughout his career he moved between employment as an account director in advertising and design companies, and working for himself with a small team of trusted colleagues. In addition to his creative skills he had an encyclopedic knowledge of song lyrics, music and literature; he had an understanding of and opinion on a wide range of subjects, including culture, politics and sport. He is survived by Nicola Wilde, his partner of 21 years, his three children, Joel, Kieren and Laura, from his marriage to Tina (nee Leonard), which ended in divorce, seven grandchildren and by me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
