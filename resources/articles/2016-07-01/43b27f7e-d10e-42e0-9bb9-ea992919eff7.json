United made a second offer on Wednesday, their first offer of \u00a387m plus add-ons having been rejected on Tuesday during a meeting with Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and the Juventus directors Giuseppe Marotta and Fabio Paratici as well as the player\u2019s agent, Mino Raiola. The deal now hinges on Juventus\u2019 demand that United pay the whole fee to Raiola, believed to be around 20%, a staggering \u00a318.4m. United had already agreed to pay their half of the agent\u2019s fee but Juve are now saying that if the deal is to be concluded United must pay the whole fee. Juventus had originally said that they would only let the player go for \u00a3100m but will now accept \u00a392m if United pay Raiola\u2019s fee. United have also agreed to buy Pogba\u2019s commercial rights and pay him an extra \u00a34.2m a season, taking his earnings to \u00a3290,000 a week. There were reports on Wednesday night that Real Madrid had been in contact with Juventus in order to try to hijack the deal but United and Raiola are confident that the player will sign for the Premier League club. The Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, said earlier this week that he was \u201chappy with the squad I have got and it\u2019s difficult to improve on it,\u201d before adding: \u201cDo I like Pogba? Of course, he\u2019s a very good player and every club wants the best players but right now he\u2019s at Juve and we have a large squad already.\u201d United are currently in China preparing for their first of two games while on tour, against Borussia Dortmund, on Friday. They then face Manchester City three days later. The United manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, has already made three additions to his squad with Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The latter has not travelled with United to China and is instead enjoying an extended break after a long season with Paris St-Germain and Euro 2016 with Sweden. The 34-year-old is expected to make his United debut against the Turkish side Galatasaray in Gothenburg on 30 July, by which time Mourinho will hope that the Pogba deal has been concluded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
