Jumping has veterans who come back year after year. Flat racing is too much of a business to allow sentiment to get in the way. But it will be impossible to resist at Ascot tomorrow, when the minds of many spectators will drift back to a time when every big race seemed to be painted in two shades of blue. Godolphin and the Coolmore Stud have the first and second favourites for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, renewing a rivalry that dates back into the last century. Remember Grandera touching off Hawk Wing in the Irish Champion Stakes? And Galileo's double-header with Fantastic Light in the summer of 2001? But while the punters and racegoers focus on Delegator, in Godolpin's royal blue, against Rip Van Winkle, in the dark silks of Coolmore, Sheikh Mohammed and John Magnier, the two colts' ultimate owners, may be looking at a wider picture. They will not see racehorses, but future \u2013 probably imminent \u2013 stallions, whose value can go down as well as up. The prize money tomorrow \u2013 about \u00a3150,000 to the winner \u2013 is all but irrelevant when set against a stallion's potential earnings over, say, a 20-year career. Once, a top breeding prospect would have been syndicated into 40 shares, entitling the holders to one \"cover\" each year. The aggressively commercial approach pioneered by Coolmore over the last three decades, though, means that stallions can cover as many as 200 mares per year. \"The operation at Coolmore is phenomenally businesslike,\" Dr Steve Harrison, whose company Thoroughbred Genetics researches the science of breeding, said yesterday. \"It was unlike anything else in the stud world until Darley [Sheikh Mohammed's operation] came along. \"Coolmore has a very commercial attitude and has always seemed to be ahead when it comes to the business side. If you take a stallion like Danehill Dancer, for example, for a while it looked as though he might not be top class, but suddenly he seems to have really clicked. He's been given a diversity of mares who were all reasonable classy and it's really paid off.\" The potential returns from stallion fees are eye-watering. Coolmore does not publish the stud fee for Galileo \u2013 if you need to ask, he's probably not for you \u2013 but the website of Darley Stud, Sheikh Mohammed's main breeding arm, lists Cape Cross, their current star sire, as standing for \u20ac35,000 (\u00a332,000). That, though, is likely increase sharply next year thanks to the exploits of his outstanding son, Sea The Stars, this season. While some fees are secret the number of times a stallion covers a mare eachseason is recorded by Weatherbys,racing's civil service. Their \"Return of Mares\" shows that Galileo, Coolmore's star operator, covered 195 mares in 2006, 196 the following year, and 209 the year after that. Even if you assume that his fee is \u00a350,000, which in Galileo's case is probably conservative, that equates to average earnings of \u00a310m \u2013 every year. All he expects in return is food, water and somewhere to sleep (heaven knows he must need it). Coolmore has two more stallions \u2013 Danehill Dancer and Montjeu \u2013 with private fees, though their output is not quite as prodigious as Galileo's, with average returns of 152 and 112 covers per year respectively between 2006 and 2008. Cape Cross, meanwhile, covered 139, 166 and 172 mares in that three-year period. Such are the potential returns when the two superpowers in European racing and breeding go head-to-head at Ascot tomorrow. Neither Sheikh Mohammed nor Magnier really needs the money, of course, and neither is ever likely to go bust. Delegator versus Rip Van Winkle is just another skirmish in a struggle that neither side will ever win completely. But money is power, in racing as elsewhere, and no one who plays the game at the top level wants to feel that they are on the back foot. Victory for one side or the other tomorrow could mark a sudden shift in the duel's momentum. As Harrison says: \"Coolmore has often seemed to be ahead of Darley in business terms, even though they may not have the same depth of resources, but never forget that one race can turn a season.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
