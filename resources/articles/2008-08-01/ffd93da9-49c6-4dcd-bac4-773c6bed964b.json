So all power to director and designer Dan Marsden, who demonstrates real flair and ambition with this piece exploring the relationship between the women who work in lap-dancing clubs and their punters. From the moment you set off up the seedy red-lit staircase to the room above, nothing is quite what it seems in this promenade performance. Just as the women who wriggle around the poles or strut along the walkway are selling illusions, so is this show. There are moments when you cannot quite believe your eyes because it seems as if the walls have moved. The technique of disorientating the audience and creating an immersive environment is one that will be familiar to anyone who has seen a Punchdrunk show. Marsden and co-director, Rose Lewenstein, handle this aspect with real aplomb. What is lacking is the content to match the aesthetic. The show makes its points quickly and then merely repeats them. It never quite negotiates the thin line between critiqueing the gentlemen and strippers of the title and actually making them seem quite sexy. The writing's lack of muscle is scarcely camouflaged by the show's multimedia overkill: a live DJ, choreographed sequences and film, as well as a last-minute and totally spurious nod towards circus skills. It is a pity because this is an ambitious and in many ways a very confident work, which not only creates a complete world, but is also worlds away from the typical Edinburgh black-box show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
