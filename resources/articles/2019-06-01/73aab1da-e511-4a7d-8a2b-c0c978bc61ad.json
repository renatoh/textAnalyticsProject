And, you know, there was a lot of critics talking about us. But we\u2019re back. So suck on that one\u201d. If ever a game could constitute a retort as bullish as the one issued by Australia\u2019s victorious captain, it was this. While the critics were determined to use Sunday\u2019s defeat to Italy as grounds to recourse to off-field politics and controversies, the Matildas were determined to use the devastation of that loss as grounds upon which to assert their strength of character. In a game backdropped by swirling media narratives and the Mediterranean heat, neither Kerr nor her teammates could countenance a group stage elimination with a defeat today. Brazil, of course, are a well-known foe. But with three wins in their previous four encounters, the South Americans are a team the Matildas know how to beat. Finding themselves back in an underdog position by needing a result and then staring down the barrel of a two-goal deficit ensured what was always going to be a spiky encounter also hit the psychological reset button for the Matildas\u2019 World Cup campaign. Changes in personnel no doubt helped. The return of Elise Kellond-Knight to the starting XI restored a sense of poise and fluidity to the side, who in their previous fixture looked increasingly uncomfortable with the pressure. At the Stade de la Mosson, they heeded assistant coach Mel Andreatta\u2019s directive \u201cto apply our principles across the 90 minutes of the game\u201d and \u201cbelieve we can execute each of those principles in every moment of the game\u201d. But the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o weren\u2019t going to make it easy for the Matildas. That would be too simple. A suckerpunch penalty came after Kellond-Knight grabbed Let\u00edcia Santos\u2019 shirt and Marta buried her effort from the spot. Then a second goal. A sense of deja vu from Sunday threatened to imbue the evening; Cristiane netted again and a team in blue and white had delivered two goals. And yet. Moments suggested that all was not lost. Vital interventions from goalkeeper Lydia Williams frustrated Brazil\u2019s attack, and Caitlin Foord\u2019s scrambled finish seconds before the half-time whistle ensured that the Matildas could return to the changing rooms with the flicker of a result in sight. Brazil\u2019s decision at the break to withdraw skipper Marta (no doubt with the knock-out stages in mind and Formiga (already set to miss Brazil\u2019s clash with Italy after picking up her second yellow card of the tournament), led to a subtle subduing. The swagger which had characterised the period in which the South Americans held the lead ebbed as the second half settled in. Fewer were the surging midfield runs, less threatening the crosses from wide. The pendulum of momentum began to swing the Matildas\u2019 way. In a similar way, so too did the contribution of Kerr. It was her presence, rather than outright goals, in this fixture that proved vital. Chloe Logarzo\u2019s equaliser in the shadows of half-time was aimed at her, and she was again in the mix when the ball came off Monica for the winner. Never will Kerr have been more pleased to make such a contribution without adding a physical, decisive touch. While the Matildas looked vulnerable to the threat of Debinha down the flanks and Marta\u2019s string-pulling at quick turnovers in the middle, this was tempered by the fact that, in contrast to Sunday, they looked a side increasingly confident in nullifying opposition attacks. While defence might remain a concern, that they have demonstrated the force of will to pull back a two-goal deficit \u2013 becoming only the second team in the Women\u2019s World Cup history to do so \u2013 signals a turning point in their campaign and a progression from their opening fixture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
