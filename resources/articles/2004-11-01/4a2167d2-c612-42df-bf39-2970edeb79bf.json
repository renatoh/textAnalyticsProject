PC Roper: Is what sorry? We're entitled to search you right, it's being taped in the interview now. All right. Everything that's being said in this car is being taped at this present time, all right. Suspect: Right. PC Roper: So has my mate told you you're under arrest. 'Cos that vehicle's stolen in a burglary, so obviously he's told you that? Suspect: Yeah, he mentioned it. PC Roper: When you're under arrest we are entitled, by force if required, to search you obviously to make sure there's nothing on you that can harm me or yourself. Suspect: Right. PC Roper: So that's what I need, to see what's in your pockets. So you could just give us your driving licence as a kick off. (Pause) PC Roper: It's on tape Ian. PC Broadhurst: Yeah, sound. Suspect: I actually don't have my driver's licence. PC Roper: So where are you from, are you from Leeds? Suspect: Leeds, ya. PC Roper: What's ya, what's your country of birth then? Suspect: (Sighs) Canada. (Pause) (Whistling sound) PC Roper: What's that there? Is that a driving licence? Suspect: No it's, thought it was, I had it. PC Roper: Sorry? Suspect: I felt I thought I had it. PC Roper: What have you got in your coat pocket, though? Have you got anything you shouldn't have in your coat pockets? What I'm saying is what have you got in your coat pockets? Suspect: (Sighs). PC Roper: Obviously for my safety more than yours, 'cos obviously I've got my back to you haven't it? Suspect: Ah ha. PC Roper: We are entitled to handcuff you, so it's up to you. Control Operator: Radio communication. Suspect: Right. (Pause) You don't need to handcuff me. PC Broadhurst: Where's it from? Suspect: Morley (Laughing) PC Roper: Have you got err? Suspect: Erm, (pause) some glasses. Control Operator: Radio communication. PC Broadhurst: When? PC Roper: Last (pause) year. Suspect: What's this? (Pause) More? (Whistling) PC Roper: Is what sorry? (Pause) No he's just talking about the car, yeah? PC Roper: (Singing) Do, do, do, do, da. Suspect: Just to let you know, I did not steal the car. PC Roper: We are not saying you did, but obviously, at this time, obviously we can't take your word for that. If you see my point, obviously. Are you having trouble finding your driving licence? Suspect: No, don't have it mate. PC Roper: Sorry? Suspect: Don't have it mate. PC Roper: You don't have it? (Whistling) Suspect: Somebody's tried to ... PC Roper: I'm just having a look at the car again. (PC Roper exits from the patrol vehicle). PC Roper: Turn your radio down. (Car door opens) PC Broadhurst: What is it? Three what? (Car door shuts) (Loud whistling) Suspect: Are you sure it's coming out stolen? PC Broadhurst: Yeah, 100%. Suspect: Did it come out? (Pause) What do you go by? PC Broadhurst: There's a chassis number on every car. Obviously people can take registration plates off and do what they want with them, can't they? Suspect: Mmmm. PC Broadhurst: But the actual chassis number ... Suspect: Guess so, I don't know. PC Broadhurst: Chassis number, chassis number, always there. (Sound of car door opening, alarm sounds) (PC Roper re-enters the patrol vehicle) PC Broadhurst: Have you got right number yet Neil? PC Roper: Yeah. Suspect: What do you need? PC Roper: Nothing cock, just checking your car. (Sound of door alarm sounding) (Whistling) (Faint humming) PC Roper: Thank you. Control Operator: Radio communication in background. PC Roper: Oooh ah. How long you been in country? Suspect: Not a long time. PC Roper: What are you doing? Married somebody over here, or ... Suspect: Ah. PC Roper: Or seeing somebody? Suspect: Dude, dude got divorced. PC Roper: Ah, tell me about it. Ha ha ha ha. PC Broadhurst: Don't start. PC Roper: Don't go into that one. Control Operator: Radio communication. Pen tapping. Suspect: So what now? PC Broadhurst: Sorry? Suspect: What now? PC Broadhurst: Now we need to go back to the police station, obviously book you into custody like I explained to you, er, we'll then get some officers to come down from the area where the car was stolen to ask you some questions. Suspect: Where was it stolen? PC Broadhurst: Erm, I'm not sure, Morley in Leeds, I think. Control Operator: Radio communication. Suspect: What's he need now? PC Broadhurst: Just checking your vehicle now, that's all. Control Operator: Radio communication. Suspect: Can you roll this window down a bit, I'm just claustrophobic. PC Broadhurst: Err. Suspect: I'm on medication for it. PC Broadhurst: Don't know if they'll come down to be honest. Suspect: Pardon? Control Operator: Radio communication. PC Broadhurst: I don't think they come down, the back. I'll do the front ones (pause) when he comes back with the keys. Control Operator: Radio communication. (Tapping sound of pen) (Sound of car door alarm) Control Operator: Continued radio communication. PC Roper: Wybeck's on their way. Suspect: What's that? PC Roper: Talking to me mate, you're all right. Suspect: What do you mean? PC Roper: You what, sorry? Suspect: Is someone looking at the car? PC Roper: No, what we do is just give it a quick search that's all to save us going down to garage that recover it to do it there. Suspect: Can you make it? PC Roper: Is what sorry? Suspect: Can you let me out for a sec? I'm on medication for claustrophobia and anxiety. PC Roper: We'll let you out in a minute, cock. Suspect: Pardon? PC Roper: We'll let you out in a second. Suspect: Just a window down or something. PC Roper: Yeah. (Pen tapping and whistling) PC Broadhurst: Put the keys in, love. PC Roper: Keys are in, love. What do you want? window? I knew I should have done summat before I came out. PC Broadhurst: Is that what it was? PC Roper: What's that? (Door alarm sounding PC Roper exits from the vehicle) Suspect: What's he keep checking? Oh man. (Heavy breathing sound, whistling) Suspect: What we waiting on? PC Broadhurst: We're getting the vehicle recovered. Suspect: Got to wait for vehicle recovery? PC Broadhurst: Aha. Control Operator: Radio communication. Suspect: So when will I be out? PC Broadhurst: Sorry? (Whistling) Suspect: So when will I get back home? (Loud radio communications over speech) PC Broadhurst: It's just obviously like I've explained to you. We'll need some officers to come over from the division that the car was stolen from and ask you some questions. Suspect: It's nowt to do with me. Where was it stolen from? PC Broadhurst: Sorry? Suspect: It's nowt to do with me. PC Broadhurst: Like I say I don't want to ask you any questions about it now. They'll ask you them all later on, OK? Control Operator: Radio communication. PC Roper: I'd think you'd appreciate if you were in Canada and somebody stole your car and the police arrested someone in possession of your car you'd expect them to be questioned, wouldn't you? You see my point, even though. Suspect: Yeah. PC Roper: I do see what you're saying but you'd expect 'em to be questioned 'cos that's how it's got to be done I'm afraid because obviously people do ... I'm not saying you are, but people do tell us lies and obviously you've to explain how you got possession of a car that's reported stolen, if you see my point. Obviously. Suspect: Yeah. PC Roper: That's down to the officers to ask you, that's why you're going back to police station. (Faint humming sound) Suspect: So how long is this going to ... PC Roper: Just try and relax for us, don't get yourself all wound up, eh? Suspect: I told you I mean I got, I need to take my medication. PC Broadhurst: What medication are you on? Suspect: Serazone and Alprazolam. PC Broadhurst: What's that for? Suspect: Anxiety disorder. (Pause) Claustrophobia. (Tapping sound, noise of vehicles outside the car, whistling) Suspect: Am I gonna be gone all night then? PC Broadhurst: Sorry? Suspect: I'll be gone all night. PC Broadhurst: No. Suspect: Until when? PC Broadhurst: Don't know yet mate, depends how long it takes. (Whistling, humming, tapping) (Noise of vehicles outside the car) (Sniffing, pen tapping) PC Roper: I did say double crude but of course what do you fucking get when you ask for something, ha ha ha. PC Broadhurst: What do you want 'em for? PC Roper: I'm not ... (Faint sound, faint sound of speech outside the car) (Sound of sniffing) PC Roper: Do you wanna, er... put cuffs on him? PC Broadhurst: Up to you, do you wanna? PC Roper: Yeah, double safety mate. (Sound of vehicle door opening, very loud whistling) PC Roper: Stop hold there mate, just stop there. Suspect: Right. PC Roper: 'Cos we're transporting you, we're having to put handcuffs on you, all right? Suspect: No. (Pause) I got ... PC Roper: Claustrophobic. Suspect: Yeah.
