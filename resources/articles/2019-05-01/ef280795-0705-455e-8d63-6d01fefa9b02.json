Trump appeared to acknowledge as much when he warned that Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, might block the changes \u2013 a sign of his political impotence as the next presidential election draws ever closer. \u201cIf for some reason, possibly political, we can\u2019t get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we will get it approved immediately after the election when we take back the House, keep the Senate and, of course, hold the presidency.\u201d An audience of cabinet members, House and Senate Republicans and Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, primary architect of the immigration plan, rose to their feet to applaud. But in a 25-minute address, in late spring sunshine, Trump made no mention of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or Daca, that protects hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the country unlawfully as children. Safeguarding these \u201cDreamers\u201d, after Trump threw their status into doubt in 2017, is a key priority for Democrats. The president hit familiar notes about drugs, gangs and human smugglers crossing the US-Mexico border, touted his signature wall and infrastructure upgrades at ports of entry and promised to crack down on \u201cfrivolous\u201d asylum claims. But he dwelled less on gory details than at similar set pieces in the past. Instead his emphasis this time was on legal immigration, which he claimed has not undergone a major legislative overhaul for 54 years. Trump, who has a long history of using foreign and undocumented labour at his own hotels and resorts, called his plan \u201cpro-American, pro-immigrant and pro-worker\u201d. He declared his intent to transform the nation\u2019s \u201cgreen card\u201d system so that it would favour people with high-level skills, degrees and job offers instead of relatives of those already in the country. Trump noted that the US admits 1.1 million immigrants as permanent legal residents each year. Green card holders get lifetime authorisation to live and work in the US and a five-year path to American citizenship. \u201cThis is the most prized citizenship anywhere in the world by far,\u201d he said. Currently two in three legal immigrants come to the US on the basis of random chance, the president continued, because they have a relative in the US, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t really matter who that relative is\u201d. Another 21% gain admission either by random lottery or because they are selected for humanitarian relief. \u201cRandom selection is contrary to American values and blocks out many qualified potential immigrants from around the world who have much to contribute,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cWhile countless, and you wouldn\u2019t believe how many countries, like Canada, create a clear path for top talent, America does not. \u201cUnder the senseless rules of the current system, we\u2019re not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one from the finest colleges in the world, anybody. We\u2019re not able to take care of it. We\u2019re not able to make those incredible breakthroughs.\u201d The president added: \u201cIf somebody graduates top of their class from the best college, \u2018Sorry, go back to your country.\u2019 We want to keep them here. Companies are moving offices to other countries because our immigration rules prevent them from retaining highly skilled and even, if I might, totally brilliant people. We discriminate against genius \u2026 we won\u2019t any more once we get this passed.\u201d Under the new plan, 57% of green cards would be awarded on merit as opposed to the current 12%. Immigrants would be expected to be financially self-sufficient, learn English and pass a civics exam. The diversity visa lottery, which offers green cards to citizens of countries with historically low rates of immigration to the US, would be terminated. \u201cIf adopted, our plan will transform America\u2019s immigration system into the pride of our nation and the envy of the modern world,\u201d Trump added. Attempts to improve the immigration system have gone nowhere for three decades amid deep partisan divisions. A compromise plan last year, that would have helped Dreamers and added money for border security, collapsed in acrimony. Thursday\u2019s effort has little chance of advancing through Congress before the 2020 presidential election. Even some Republicans have expressed reservations, noting that it does not reduce overall rates of immigration. \u201cThe White House plan makes no change to the number of green cards allocated each year,\u201d Trump had said. Democrats were more aggressive in their condemnation. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said: \u201cThis dead-on-arrival plan is not a remotely serious proposal. The White House has repackaged the worst of its past failed immigration plans \u2026 To say that this plan\u2019s application criteria are \u2018merit-based\u2019 is the height of condescension.\u201d Before Trump\u2019s announcement, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: \ufeff\u201cWhen Stephen Miller, one of the president\u2019s most virulently anti-immigrant advisers, is in the room crafting your immigration plan, it\u2019s a surefire failure.\u201d And Pili Tobar, the deputy director of America\u2019s Voice, a group that advocates for immigrants\u2019 rights, warned: \u201cThis is not designed to be a serious policy proposal \u2013 it\u2019s a message document that\u2019s a misguided attempt at political posturing. To say it\u2019s dead on arrival would be generous.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
