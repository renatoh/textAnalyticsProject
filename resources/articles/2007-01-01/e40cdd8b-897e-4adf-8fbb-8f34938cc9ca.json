Alongside making a pledge to God and the Queen, guides are to be given peer education in sexual health, binge drinking and eating disorders. The Get Wise scheme being introduced for 14- to 25-year-olds will cover issues such as teenage pregnancy, contraception and sexually transmitted diseases. It's Girlguiding UK coming of age and another step in the increasingly desperate battle to reduce teenage pregnancies, the spread of sexual diseases - such as chlamydia - and binge drinking. But can the guides do any better than the schools? It would be difficult to do worse: personal, social and health education in schools is one of the most poorly taught subjects, undervalued, under-resourced and consistently criticised by Ofsted. Schools have to provide sex education, but it's not stipulated what it should cover, and teachers are rarely trained to do it properly. Ofsted says too much is being taught by form tutors, most of whom did not expect to find themselves, armed only with a fistful of condoms, explaining the facts of life to a giggling class of hormonal teenagers. There is evidence that the peer mentoring system being brought in by Girlguiding UK is a popular method with teenagers. The Medical Research Council, which has an ongoing programme of trialling and assessing sex education programmes, has found it is much preferred. Its 2004 research compared the experiences of pupils taught by peers and those taught by teachers. It found the former to be far more popular. By age 16, 35% of girls in the peer-led group reported having had sex, compared with 41% of the teacher-led group. But those in the first group were no more likely to use condoms. Still, any small victory is important in this area. Fifteen-year-old girls in England are twice as likely to be sexually active as those in France and Holland. Rates of chlamydia have doubled in a decade. The government's teenage pregnancy strategy has taken a kicking for the slow impact it's had in tackling unsafe sex and teenage pregnancies, but it has had the biggest impact in poorer areas with the biggest problems; in more affluent areas, where it was not implemented, rates have crept up. Local action is needed, partly through schools, but also through community groups - and the girl guides may well be part of that. But will teenagers most at risk of drug-taking, getting pregnant and having unsafe sex get a place as a girl guide should they want one? There are currently 50,000 girls on the waiting lists. Polly Curtis Let's get personal You won't find a person who disagrees. The teaching unions have already given it the thumbs-up, and both Ofsted and schools minister Jim Knight gave it their seal of approval last week. Personalised learning is the way forward. Only it's hard to find a teacher who doesn't think he or she is doing it already. What is it exactly? \"Put simply,\" says Christine Gilbert's Ofsted report, \"personalised learning and teaching means taking a highly structured and responsive approach to each child's and young person's learning, in order that all are able to progress, achieve and participate.\" That's the trouble with education theory - it's so generalised as to be almost meaningless. Let's imagine what personalised learning might have looked like for 14-year-old Michael Perham over the past six weeks. Rather than emailing his friends and family during his record-breaking voyage across the Atlantic, he could have been keeping up with his school coursework. Seldom have so many ideal learning opportunities been so flagrantly passed by. It's not just the fact that he failed to tune in to Radio Azores to improve his Portuguese, or that he listened to the weather forecast rather than relying on his own judgment of wind strength and cloud formation. Thank God his satellite technology and GPS failed for a while and he was forced to apply basic maths and steer by the stars. Perham didn't even get much support from his family. One of the key aspects of personalised learning is for parents and carers to take a hands-on interest in their child's education. And his dad sailing along a couple of miles behind him hardly counts as hands-on, unless he's got very long arms. Just remember: there is no adventure that can't be ruined by turning it into a personalised learning experience. John Crace"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
