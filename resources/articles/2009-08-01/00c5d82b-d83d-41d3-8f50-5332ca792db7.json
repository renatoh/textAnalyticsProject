Hanging baskets are deeply uncool but perennially popular, with good reason \u2013 if space is limited, they open up a whole new set of possibilities for growing. One garden at Chelsea this year featured a metal colander that had been pressed into service to grow trailing strawberries \u2013 a great idea. But for a year-round harvest, plant perennial herbs such as sage, chives, thyme, mint and rosemary, all of which will thrive in a basket in a sunny spot outdoors. Include at least one plant that will trail down the side \u2013 a creeping thyme or prostrate rosemary is ideal; and you can always make temporary additions, such as cut-and-come-again lettuce. Find a colander \u2013 whatever takes your fancy, be it old blue-and-white enamel, modern metal or even brightly-coloured plastic \u2013 buy some hanging basket chains to hook into the topmost holes (or thread some rope or drapery cord through a hole and secure it with a couple of knots) and line with something to stop soil falling through the holes and retain moisture \u2013 a hanging basket liner or old compost sack with drainage holes cut into it will do, but best of all is an old woollen jumper cut to size. Add handfuls of dampened, peat-free potting compost mixed with a sprinkle of water-retaining crystals until the colander is half-full, then position your plants, removing them from their pots and teasing out the roots. Add more compost around the rootballs and firm the plants in. Don't overcrowd the basket \u2013 they will grow to fill out the space \u2013 then give the whole thing a good soak before hanging. And remember to water daily in hot weather and feed weekly. And \"edit\" the basket every few months, refreshing the compost, trimming the herbs and replacing any past their best.

Terrariums (aka bottle gardens) are the ultimate low-maintenance way of growing indoor plants: the closed environment of a glass jar keeps them cosy all year round and they rarely (if ever) need watering. Canny choice of container and plant is key \u2013 look for a lidded glass container with a wide neck, and avoid coloured or patterned glass: it could be a tall sweet jar or even a glass cake or cheese dome. Next, pick your plants: think small-leaved, slow-growing foliage. One taller plant and two lower-growing specimens are ideal: pileas, peperomias, fittonias, Ficus pumila, selaginellas and small ferns are all ideal, as are small specimens of the parlour palm, Chamaedorea elegans. You can use faster-growing plants such as Chlorophytum comosum 'Ocean' (pictured below), but be prepared to replant regularly to stop the terrarium getting overcrowded. To build your garden, take a clean, 20cm-high jar (adjust quantities accordingly if yours is bigger), add a 3cm layer of washed gravel or small pebbles, then a similar depth of house plant compost. For each plant, make a hole that's slightly bigger than its rootball, then lower it in, adding more compost and firming around the stem. Add a sprinkle of water and pop on the lid (though you may need to remove it for a while if condensation forms). Position the terrarium in a bright place out of direct sunlight, and preen every few months: the removal of dead leaves and overgrown plants and an occasional spray of water will keep it looking good.

Unlike most house plants, carnivorous plants like to be waterlogged, so are ideal for more unusual pots without drainage holes, such as teacups and fruit bowls. Dionaea muscipula (venus fly trap), Drosera capensis (Cape sundew) and Sarracenias (pictured top right), will happily catch flies on a sunny windowsill if the soil is kept wet with rainwater (never tap). Pick a pot big enough to fit the plant's rootball with ease and use a peat substitute (try Moorland Gold, from Tamar Organics, 01579 371087).
