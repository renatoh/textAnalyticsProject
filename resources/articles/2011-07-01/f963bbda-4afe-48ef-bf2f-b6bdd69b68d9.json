She said: \"I've been saving for years and have been wanting to buy for a while now because of the low interest rates and high rents. \"I have \u00a335,000 saved but on my salary I can only get a mortgage of \u00a3150,000, so even with a loan from my generous parents I can only stretch to \u00a3220,000 which isn't really enough to buy in London. \"Despite stumping up a massive deposit, I can barely afford to buy anything that's not in a grotty basement of a run-down block. \"It's also becoming difficult to save much more because rents are so high. I am looking for a new flat to rent with my boyfriend and the going rate is about \u00a3310-\u00a3350 per week. I'm looking at moving to Stoke Newington because rents are so high in Angel, but I might even be priced out of Stoke Newington now. \"Rents are only going to keep going up because so many can't afford to buy. We are looking at rental flats with five or six other couples \u2013 the competition is really fierce. I know that my generation want the latest iPhone and to go out all the time, so we don't always present an image of ourselves as conscientious savers. But I don't live like that; I have saved for years. \"Buy-to-let investors have bought up all the property and there just isn't enough housing stock. I think first-time buyers have been cast aside. Yes, the coalition has introduced some housing initiatives, but they all seem to favour housing developers, not first-time buyers. \"I have a good job and I'm very careful with my money. I shouldn't be in this position.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
