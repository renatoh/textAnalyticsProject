Sanchez named a squad of 24, which he plans to whittle down to 18 by the time they face Poland for their first World Cup qualifier in September. Northern Ireland also have group games against England, Wales, Austria and Azerbaijan to contend with. \"This is the first get-together and nobody is quite certain which of the 24 will be down to the 18 when we come to play against Poland in September,\" Sanchez said. \"I will say to them, 'If you want to be in the 18, here are the people you are going to be competing against'. \"You have got to have good club form so you can take that into the international arena. I don't want people just thinking that even though they are not playing for their clubs, because they have always played for Northern Ireland, they will always continue to play. To be honest it hasn't worked in the last two years. \"From now on I am going to cut down the number and players need to show me what it means to them - they can do that with their performances on the field. It is hard to be sitting on the bench or playing in the reserves then come and play international football and expect to be in a groove. Playing for their clubs is important if they want to play in the international team for the next couple of years.\" Sanchez's squad is full of familiar faces, although there are a few surprises. Danny Sonner of Nottingham Forest has been recalled for the first time in three years and there is also a place for defender Mark Williams, who has just returned to Wimbledon after a spell with Columbus Crew. James Quinn, who plays for the Dutch side Willem II, is also recalled as Northern Ireland bid to end a spell stretching 1,242 minutes without a goal. \"Sonner and Williams both come into the category I am looking for in that they are playing in the top two flights in English football,\" Sanchez said. \"As for Quinn, everyone knows our scoring record and I want to talk to everyone who has a chance of being involved.\" Gerry Armstrong is the assistant manager while Sanchez's former Wimbledon team-mates Terry Gibson and Dave Beasant will join the coaching staff, linking up on a match-to-match basis. \"While I am the figurehead of the organisation, it's important you have good people around you, who you can trust and who can work well with the players,\" the manager added. Darren Byfield, meanwhile, has tasted both pleasure and pain within days of beginning his career with Sunderland. The 27-year-old striker got off to the ideal start on Saturday when he came off the bench to score a late equaliser at Watford. However, the former Aston Villa man will be a bystander this Saturday, when his team-mates attempt to reach the FA Cup quarter-final against Birmingham. Byfield, who arrived on Wearside in a straight swap for Michael Proctor, is ineligible for the visit of Birmingham having turned out for his former club Rotherham in an earlier round, and will have to wait for a league game at Cardiff on February 21 for his next chance. \"It's a blow because Birmingham is a great game for the club and I would love to be involved,\" he said. \"Everything happened so quickly over the weekend. One minute I was being picked up on the M1 by the team bus, the next I managed to get a goal on my debut. \"I just want to settle in now and put in a good week's training. It's just a shame for me that there's no game at the end of it. It's a fifth-round FA Cup tie, I'm from Birmingham and I know a few of the lads down there.\" Northern Ireland : Taylor (Birmingham), Carroll (Man Utd), Baird (Southampton), A Hughes (Newcastle), McCartney (Sunderland), Kennedy (Wigan), Griffin (Stockport), Craigan (Motherwell), Murdock (Hibs), Williams (Wimbledon); Gillespie (Leicester), Johnson (Birmingham), Mulryne (Norwich), Whitley (Sunderland), Sonner (N Forest), M Hughes (C Palace), McVeigh (Norwich), Elliott (Hull), Jones (Crewe), Healy (Preston), Hamilton (Portadown), Smith (Glentoran), Quinn (Willem 11), Kirk (Hearts)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
