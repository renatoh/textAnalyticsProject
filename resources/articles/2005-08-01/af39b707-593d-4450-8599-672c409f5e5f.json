But Italy take on the Republic of Ireland tonight cast not as headline attraction but glamorous warm-up act. The more excited talk here is already centred on Ireland's pivotal World Cup qualifier at home to France in three weeks' time. This friendly, which Italy are likely to start with a strong team, is regarded as the best possible preparation. \"If you can try to get opposition similar to France I think Italy is the ideal one,\" Ireland's manager Brian Kerr said yesterday. He noted that far more will be at stake next month and that his players will face a different system but outlined why Marcello Lippi's squad are ideal opponents. \"There is the technical ability of their players and it will be important that our concentration levels are very high and we are patient,\" Kerr said. \"At times our concentration has fallen and we have lost a goal. Maybe lack of concentration [cost a win] in Israel late on.\" Kerr can hardly have been surprised that he was not asked a single question about individual Italy players but had his opinion sought on the return from international exile of France's Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, Claude Makelele and Lilian Thuram. \"Three great players,\" he said, before adding a positive gloss: \"Our players will be more familiar with the likes of Zidane, Makelele and Thuram - if they play - than they would be maybe with [Beno\u00eet] Pedretti, [Rio Antonio] Mavuba or [Alou] Diarra and the other players who have had a go.\" Kerr admitted he was \"concerned\" about the lack of club action some of his players might get before the France game. Robbie Keane, who is absent because of injury, is not currently a first choice at Tottenham and his strike partner Clinton Morrison is in a similar situation at Birmingham City. Morrison's plight has worsened with the signings of Walter Pandiani and Mikael Forssell and he \"definitely\" expects to leave this month. \"I'm not prepared to be sitting on the bench,\" he said. Sunderland could not match his wages, so would he take a pay cut? \"It's big, you know, I wear a lot of diamonds and that,\" he said with a smile. \"It depends really and truly on the situation. But I have always said the money is the not the big thing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
