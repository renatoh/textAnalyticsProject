This means there is not only lots of choice left, but you can get your hands on the type of cottages that normally get booked up at least six months in advance. Classic Cottages (01326 555 555) has plenty to choose from in Cornwall. A particularly attractive cottage that has come up for rent over Easter is in St Agnes on the north coast. The good thing about this double-fronted, oak-beamed cottage (it sleeps six) is that you can walk to the beach and there's a good pub and shop nearby. Available from 13 April for one week, price \u00a3346. \u0095 If you want to get the last bit of skiing of the season in, but your children are still small, try Zermatt, Switzerland. Its high altitude makes it one of the better bets for good snow conditions and the resort offers decent child care. Powder Byrne (020 8246 5300) doesn't come cheap, but is very flexible and doesn't fall short on service. Seven nights half-board from 7 to 15 April starts at \u00a3829 per person. Children under two can go for \u00a360; it's \u00a3280 for those under three. Expect to pay \u00a3150 extra per child for childcare per week. \u0095 Fancy spending the Easter weekend in the sun? Flightline International (01342 717 333) has return charter flights to Alicante in Spain for \u00a3169 return departing for four days from Gatwick on 12 April. The great thing is that the break falls over all those bank holidays, so you can have four days on the beach without dipping into your annual holiday entitlement. There is a drawback (of course). They are night flights, which means that you would have to arrive in the office straight from the airport on 17 April looking tanned, but knackered. \u0095 Greek Orthodox Easter with candlelit processions and firework displays make this a special time to visit Greece (and the celebrations are, unusually, on the same weekend as our Easter this year). It's also neither too busy nor too hot at this time of year. Sunvil Holidays (020 8568 4499, has packages to Almirida in north-west Crete departing on Tuesday (3 April) for two weeks costing \u00a3391 pp (adult or child), including self-catering accommodation at the Irini Studios, transfers and return flights. \u0095If you love hiking and are frustrated by the restrictions on walking in the UK, consider Slovenia. Not only is it reasonably priced, but has stunning mountain scenery. Slovenija Pursuits (0870 2200 201) has five-day breaks over Easter (on a choice of departure dates) which include a three-day trek in the Karavanke Alps, staying in mountain refuges and visiting traditional herdsmen's huts. Cost is \u00a3352 per person (based on two travelling) including three nights B&amp;B in a farmhouse, two nights half-board in mountain huts, return flights from Heathrow and transfers. Where can we go later? \u0095Several short-break tour operators recently started offering breaks to places you would not normally think about for a weekend away. Despite the jetlag and long flying times, people are choosing to go on them. They are aimed at the type of people who just can't face another short break in New York - they've been so many times. San Francisco (11 hours 10 minutes flight) is now the top long-haul choice for Travelscene customers, followed by Singapore (12 hours 40 minutes) and Rio de Janeiro (13 hours 40 minutes). Four-night breaks in San Francisco start at \u00a3549 per person including three-star hotel, return flights from Heathrow, Birmingham or Manchester. Four nights in Singapore or Rio start at \u00a3675 and \u00a3786 respectively. Given the choice, I'd choose Rio for a short break over the others any day. It's only three hours behind us, so the jetlag isn't too severe, and the Brazilian beach life is bonkers. Lots of sculptured bodies doing press ups and playing beach volleyball. The agua de cocos aren't bad either (these are the delicious fresh chilled coconuts whacked open with a machete to provide a cooling drinkby beach vendors). Travelscene (020 8424 9648). \u0095 If you're still wondering where to go this summer, consider Turkey which is going to be popular this year as Britons find they have increased spending power after the recent devaluation of the lira. It's a good bet for beach lovers as well as anyone who prefers some cheap adventure and culture close to home. Explore Worldwide (01252 760 100) has a wide range of holidays this summer from \u00a3490 per person for eight days exploring Graeco-Roman sites to a 15-day gulet cruise exploring the Med, stopping in small villages and visiting ancient ruins for \u00a3685 per person."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
