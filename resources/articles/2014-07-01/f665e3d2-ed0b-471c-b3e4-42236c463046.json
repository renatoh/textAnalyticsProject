It was a night in the pool that Scotland will savour as golds for Ross Murdoch and Hannah Miley elevated the Commonwealth Games hosts to third in the medal table after one day in Glasgow. For Jamieson, though, there was only bitter disappointment. Murdoch had obviously not read the script. His was a staggering victory that nobody had expected, against the poster boy of these Games who won Olympic silver in the 200m breaststroke two years ago. Jamieson was expected to raise the roof at Tollcross on a crucial evening for Scotland but although the roof was certainly raised, it was his compatriot, not him, standing tallest on the podium. Murdoch smashed his personal best and clocked a Commonwealth record of 2.07:30. Jamieson appeared crestfallen as he received his silver, even if he had congratulated Murdoch in the aftermath of defeat when his young rival simply gazed in disbelief at the big screen \u201cI\u2019m obviously gutted,\u201d said Jamieson, who could not muster the energy to claw Murdoch back in the final 50m, finishing in 2.08:40, ahead of England\u2019s Andrew Willis. \u201cI didn\u2019t prepare for second place, I came to win. I\u2019ve had unbelievable support in the last couple of years since London\u201a but Ross deserved to win tonight. \u201cI was probably swimming with too much emotion, probably getting too uptight in the last couple of days, forgetting that it\u2019s just another race. It was the biggest race of my life but I think if I was going to swim well tonight I had to get over that and stay as relaxed as possible. It\u2019s not about me tonight, it\u2019s about Ross. He was far and away the best swimmer in the pool tonight.\u201d Murdoch\u2019s time was sixth-tenths of a second outside the world record and the tears flowed as Flower of Scotland played out inside the Tollcross International Swimming Centre, which produced a noise that belied its 5,000 capacity. Tears of joy had also flooded from Miley\u2019s eyes earlier in the evening and Murdoch was still coming to terms with his win long after the event. \u201cThere is no way that just happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last 100m the sound was just amazing and it drove me on. I felt really good this morning in the heats but I didn\u2019t believe that I could do that. It is my grandad\u2019s 70th birthday so that is for him. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that would become a reality. I can\u2019t really explain how it feels, it is something I will remember for the rest of my life. That was the best thing that ever happened to me and it meant the world. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you come up against someone as prestigious as him [Jamieson]. To stand up against the more experienced man was nerve-racking but it was all about holding my own.\u201d It was a fitting denouement to a remarkable evening of swimming, coming soon after Miley\u2019s captivating performance. The 24-year-old from Inverurie was pushed to the end by her English opponent Aimee Willmott in the 400m individual medley but clawed her way in front with 50m remaining and held on. She easily beat her Commonwealth record set earlier in the day in the heats, but it was a hugely dramatic race that had appeared to be slipping just out of Miley\u2019s grasp. Willmott was ahead after 200m and the Australian Keryn McMaster was pushing with the Scot to rein her in. McMaster, though, fell away and Miley found a last surge of energy down the final stretch to secure the win by more than one second. For an initial moment she did not realise what had occurred but, once the result appeared on the big screen, an outpouring of emotion followed. Miley looked upwards in joy and disbelief, while the volume inside the arena increased. It was all too much for Miley\u2019s father and coach, Patrick, who was reduced to tears. There were more to follow during the medal presentation, as the anthem proved the catalyst for Miley\u2019s waterworks. \u201cOh my God, that was just incredible,\u201d said Miley. \u201cI literally couldn\u2019t feel my legs for the last 50, so when I touched the wall I was hoping and praying that I could go fast. I\u2019m absolutely knackered.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
