Nasser Hussain and co have finally put their foot down: they don't want to play in Zimbabwe. In a food chain that includes the British government at the top, the ICC, the ECB, and - last and least - the England team, it is the plankton that has emerged with the most credit. Until now, the whole affair was emitting the sickening stench of opportunism. The government only objected to England's game in Zimbabwe when they realised that objecting would be a more powerful symbol - oh, and a less costly one - of their opposition to Mugabe than severing the umbilical cord of commercialism. The ICC are reluctant to change venues because of money too: last-minute decisions are costly, inconvenient, and anyway, sport and politics don't mix (oh yes they do: just ask apartheid South Africa). As for the ECB, they were quite happy to take the moral high ground until they realised that the government wouldn't compensate them for any losses incurred by pulling out of Zimbabwe. The message has been clear: morality's all very well, but in a world where money talks, morality is naive. Thus it was left to the players. Hussain had all along maintained - disingenuously perhaps - that his boys should have nothing to do with the decision. But several things have changed. First, the players, keen not to appear \"numbheads\", as Hussain put it, have educated themselves on the horrors of Mugabe's Zimbabwe. Second, they received threatening letters while in Australia warning them not to go. Third, the streets of Harare are becoming more dangerous by the day. Fourth, they were lumbered with a ridiculous Ashes itinerary that has left them with very little time to recharge batteries for the World Cup, no time at all to spend a few relaxing days at home, and no sympathy whatsoever from the ECB. Fifth, they feel let down by the ECB chairman, David Morgan, who failed to press for a change of venue during a recent conference call with the ICC, and then revealed publicly that England's players were in two minds about the trip. Enough was clearly enough. Player power has become the theme of this World Cup before it has even begun. The Indians deleted certain clauses from their competition contracts. The Sri Lankans demanded a bigger slice of the pie from their board. The West Indians wanted more from their board's sponsorship deal. And now England are objecting - on moral, political and safety grounds. Good for them. The ECB meet with the ICC on Thursday, but don't hold you breath. If a tired and distracted England flunk it for the third World Cup in a row, we'll know who to blame. And it won't be the players. QUOTE OF THE WEEK \"What is it? A picture of Steve Waugh?\" - Nasser Hussain shows he can still smile after he is presented with a book by the Australian media to thank him for his co-operation throughout the tour. SILLY POINT: SILLY SEASON Sponsorship rows, breaches of contract, security problems, Brett Lee. Cricket's sideshows have become so irritating of late that it's easy to forget we're about to witness a World Cup. Easy, that is, until you realise that now, with less than two weeks to go before the first riot in Harare, is roughly the moment when players and ex-players begin to confuse kidology with kismet, and predict all kinds of ludicrous outcomes, most of which involve their teams upsetting hopeless odds. First up on his Speaker's Corner soapbox was a tall Jamaican who bore an uncanny resemblance to Courtney Walsh, and spoke like him too. \"I expect them to go all the way,\" he drawled, as onlookers, realising he was talking about the 2003 West Indians rather than the 1975 version, shook their heads sadly. \"Once we get to the final,\" he continued, undeterred, \"the better team will come up trumps. We have to play some good cricket and I am backing the boys to make it. I like the position they're in - where nobody is paying them much attention.\" At that point the three remaining onlookers began listening to another speaker. Next up on the box was a man who, in any other situation, would surely have been mistaken for Waqar Younis. Except he started ranting on about Pakistan beating Australia in the sides' opening fixture on February 11. Onlookers pricked up their ears. \"That match is very important,\" he said. \"If we win it, this will leave an impact on the other teams as well and we are going to leave an impact by beating them.\" As a heckler with a dangly-cork hat peppered him with insults like \"53 all out\" and \"59 all out\", the Waqar clone was elbowed to one side by a man with a large nose. \"We can beat Australia, definitely,\" began the prominent-proboscised one, who - bear with the Spin here - could have been Nasser Hussain in a different light. \"We were one over away from beating Australia,\" continued the charlatan, \"so we won't be going into the World Cup thinking we can't beat them.\" After 13 defeats in a row against the Aussies, the Spin wondered exactly what the man was on, and where he could get some. Yes, the World Cup really must be around the corner. COW CORNER: IT'S A RICH MAN'S WORLD Picture the scene. The Spin's South African cousin, Johannes van der Schpin, takes his five-year-old son, Willem, to the World Cup curtain-raiser at Cape Town on February 9 to watch South Africa play West Indies. Little Willem puts on his favourite T-shirt, which has the words Coca-Cola emblazoned on the front, but covers it with a jacket. Halfway through the game, a nearby piece of biltong causes Willem to retch, so he takes off the jacket to get some fresh air. An officious security guard spots the Coca-Cola logo and escorts Willem from the stadium because the T-shirt conflicts with Pepsi, one of the tournament's official sponsors. What, you might join the Spin in asking, is the world coming to? More pertinently, what is the World Cup coming to? Because according to a report in Johannesburg's Star newspaper, this scenario - a cross between Monty Python's Flying Circus and Joe Stalin's Soviet Union - could become a reality. The issue is ambush marketing, whereby dangerous criminals like five-year-old Willem seek to undermine the hard-fought commercial deals of the World Cup's official sponsors. But the real issue is money, money, money (the bookies' favourite to dominate proceedings when the competition finally gets under way). \"I will have a legal team at each World Cup match,\" warned Clifford Green, a lawyer fighting the brave fight against ambush marketing. \"At the push of a button, we will instruct police to eject a patron who wasn't complying with the regulations\". Rodney Hartman, the United Cricket Board's communications director, sounded even more sinister. \"People should give a little thought before wearing anything that will be in conflict with our sponsors,\" he weaselled. After failing to blackmail India's cricketers into giving up their personal endorsements, many of which clash with official tournament sponsors, the ICC has clearly decided to crack down on innocent spectators. The Spin wishes them every success. THE WEEK IN CRICKET Another former Australian Test umpire, Lou Rowan, calls for Muttiah Muralitharan to be banned because of his action ...
