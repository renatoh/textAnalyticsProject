It said the company \u201cpays 0.1%, or 1/1,000th%\u201d. 0.1% is equivalent to one-thousandth (1/1,000) \u2013 not the same as one one-thousandth per cent (one-thousandth of one percentage point), which would equate to 0.001% (\u201cHow Britain fell for Wetherspoon\u2019s\u201d, Magazine, 6 August, page 21). A panel accompanying \u201cBenedictines elect new chief and brace for stormy autumn as order faces abuse inquiry\u201d (News, last week, page 15) said, of Benedictine schools, that Ampleforth was founded in 1802, followed by Downside in 1814. Technically, Downside was formed in 1606, at the community of St Gregory the Great at Douai, in Flanders. English Catholics were given sanctuary there, following the dissolution of the monasteries from 1530. Its founders organised a school for English boys and provided a base for Benedictine missions in England. It moved to its current site in 1814.
