The former Labor premier of NSW, Bob Carr, and the former Liberal Victoria premier, Jeff Kennett, launched the Australia 21 report on Monday, which calls for an end to criminalisation of drug users. The report, entitled \u201cCan Australia respond to drugs more effectively and safely?\u201d, makes 13 recommendations around minimising drug-related harm and the burden on the criminal justice system. Among them are reducing and, where possible, eliminating penalties for possession and use; expanding health and social assistance for young people struggling with drug addiction; and undermining the black market with a regulated \u201cwhite\u201d market. It recommends pill-testing be trialled to work as \u201cindirect quality control \u2026 on the drug market\u201d. At the launch of the report in Sydney, former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett said there had been no seminal advance in addressing the challenges for 40 to 50 years, with the exception of Sydney\u2019s safe injecting facility. \u201cAnecdotally, it seems to be getting worse,\u201d he said. \u201cYet where are the legislators today with the courage to try something different that might, in some way, bring about a change of direction in this particular area of pursuit?\u201d Kennett said the rise of drugs such as ice meant emergency service personnel were also forced to suffer the consequences of drug use. Four former police commissioners and assistant commissioners, two former heads of corrective services, a former supreme court judge and a former director of public prosecution also put their names to the report. It was born of a roundtable convened by Mick Palmer, former commissioner of the Australian federal police and Northern Territory police, at the University of Sydney in September 2015. The current system was \u201cbadly broken, ineffective and even counterproductive\u201d to the aim of harm minimisation, he said in a statement. \u201cWe must be courageous enough to consider a new and different approach.\u201d The Australia 21 report proposes redefining drugs as a health and social issue, rather than a criminal justice one \u2013 an approach that has been adopted in 11 states of the US, several western European countries, India, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and many other countries around the world. \u201cAustralia has just looked on,\u201d the report\u2019s summary notes. \u201cOur capacity for reform has been gridlocked. \u201cMeanwhile, Australia\u2019s drug problems have grown steadily worse.\u201d It calls for a distinction to be made between \u201chigh-end production and trafficking\u201d and personal use and possession, and for the \u201cdiscretionary approach \u2026 already being adopted by frontline law enforcers\u201d to be standardised. Reform should be slow and incremental, and reevaluated at every step. \u201cA review of current attitudes and approaches should be a free-ranging attempt to legitimise the existing approach, tinker with it or replace it,\u201d wrote Jack Johnston, former Tasmanian police commissioner. But there was general agreement that some drugs \u2013 \u201c100% pure\u201d heroin, cocaine and ice \u2013 \u201cshould never and would never be subjected to regulated availability\u201d, the report noted. This is the third in a series of Australia 21 reports on drug law reform after the first two being released in 2012. All three were funded by an anonymous donor. According to the Australian Crime Commission, 80,000 drug consumer arrests are made each year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
