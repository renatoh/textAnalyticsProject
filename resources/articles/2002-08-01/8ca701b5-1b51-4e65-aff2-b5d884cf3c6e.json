The whole building is lit up like some gigantic light sculpture: downstairs is filled with a glowing white light while upstairs is bathed in apple green. It's easy to see why passers-by often knock on his door to see what's inside. Stepping through the front door from the mews outside takes some getting used to. During daylight hours, this is one of the whitest of white living spaces you are likely to come across: a white box backlit by four white panels, filled with white furniture, with a pale shiny floor. Shoes, not surprisingly, have to be left at the door. Architect Mike Tonkin from Tonkin Architects describes it as being more like a gallery than a house, which is apt given that Young's brief was a scrap of paper with an image by American light- installation artist James Turrell consisting of 'a pale-blue light circled by an orange tinge'. As for the white gallery-style walls, they act as a perfect foil to the light show, which takes place as soon as the sun starts setting. The lighting is nothing short of futuristic. Yellow light bulbs have been banished, and there are no lamps or overhead lampshades. Instead, a hi-tech, hidden lighting system controlled by a central computer allows Young, an IT consultant, to transform the colour of each room at the push of a pre-set button, or the click of a mouse. Green can switch to blue, violet, red or orange in an instant, or be programmed to change slowly across a room. Different colours in different corners merge and bounce off each other. 'What I was really interested was something reconfigurable,' says Young, 'so that I wouldn't get bored.' Young has disappeared into a tiny cubbyhole in the bedroom to play with the computer and show what fun there is to be had. The idea is so simple, he says, he doesn't understand why nobody's done it before. With groups of yellow, red and blue colour-changing tubes tucked here and there, why bother painting walls a particular shade, when you can change them according to mood, weather or time of day? The same goes for the white furniture, which takes on various colours of the lights around it. As for the endlessly changing shadows and reflections, Young loves them. Apart from the computer, the basement houses a modern take on a four-poster bed which fits into the corner of the room and is lit up from within. The bed and walls are all lined with wide MDF planks, which conceal floor-to-ceiling cupboards under the stairs, utility cupboards and a door that leads into the chrome-and-white bathroom. Young points out a purple edge that is green on the other side, thanks to the fall of light which reminds him, he says, of the 'different colours and radiosity of Monet's paintings of Rouen cathedral' - which goes a long way to explaining why he is not satisfied by the light given off by regular light bulbs. Tonkin describes the house as a well - an image nicely helped along by the glistening resin floors - which gets gradually lighter as you move up from the bedroom, through the kitchen/dining room to the living room at the top, lit by large glass doors at the front and large skylights above. This floor feels very much like a platform, with a glass balustrade instead of a back wall over which you can lean to look down into the kitchen and the light well, which punctures all three floors, creating a feeling of space and shooting daylight down to the shower and bedroom. The living room is all white with a splash of warmth from a sheepskin rug and a dark-brown sheepskin beanbag, which looks like a curled-up cuddly bear in the corner of the room. Greenery clambers over the doors and windows and a wooden ladder can be hitched into place to reach the decking-covered roof garden above. The effect of making the house semi-open plan, with 'platforms' rather than wall-to-wall floors, has created a lot more space, says Young. 'It is more like a loft space and feels very social as sounds drift downstairs.' In-built speakers dotted around the place carry the sounds of the stereo or TV, cinema-style, right down to the 4.7m, glass-sided shower. Standing under the shower, as it throws water from such a great height, is 'like being in warm rain,' he says. When Young moved in with his girlfriend Elise four years ago, the house was very conventional and very dark. The ground floor had a garage in it, and for the first two years they lived without a proper kitchen or bathroom. Three-course dinner parties were rustled up on two electric hobs. Now they have dinner parties on a weekly basis and it is this room that you first walk into. The kitchen, which faces the front door, is raised and looks out into the room, so that chef and guests can party together. Here, as throughout the house, everything is designed with striking simplicity. And plenty of cupboard space means that everything has its place. The toaster, olive oil, kettle and everything else needed within easy reach are tucked out of sight on an open hidden shelf behind the units on the back wall: reassuring kitchen clutter that proves people actually live here, but which is only visible from the upper landings. The raised stage-like kitchen seems perfectly placed, given that the overriding sensation is of being surrounded by a multicoloured stage set, and is dramatically backlit by the four rectangular glass panels. Young says he is constantly struck by the limitations of 'rudimentary light bulbs'. 'They give off such a sickly yellow colour and the shadows are horrible and all directed from the centre,' he says. But given that a stroll down his staircase is like walking into the centre of a mind-altering art installation, it's not surprising there's no going back to the bare bulbs the rest of us are used to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
