The river Dove is the boundary between Staffordshire and Derbyshire from Axe Edge to Newton Solney on the river Trent, 40 miles to the south. For too long Staffordshire has been associated in the public consciousness with the Black Country, the Potteries, a breed of dangerous dog and M6 congestion. In reality the north of the county is home to some of the UK's must beautiful countryside \u2013 the Manifold Valley, for example. The villages of Flash \u2013 the highest in the country \u2013 Longnor, Warslow, Hulme End, Alstonefield, Wetton and Ilam are all in Staffordshire despite the insidious postcode lottery that hints at them being next door in Derbyshire through associations with Buxton and Ashbourne rather than Leek. Let's use those Dovedale stepping stones to walk into some of England's finest countryside \u2013 in Staffordshire.
