His performance of the Oboe Concerto, with Daniel Harding and the Swedish Radio Symphony, is one of the finest on disc. Bigger in scale than most, it's closer in feel to Strauss's own mid-period operas \u2013 Rosenkavalier, say, or Intermezzo \u2013 than to Mozartian neo-classicism. Leleux's phrasing, however, rapturous yet infinitely sad, also reminds us that this is a work written in the aftermath of the second world war, one that expresses Strauss's relief that his nightmare, both political and private, was at long last over. He joins his own Ensemble \u00e0 Vent Paris-Bastille, meanwhile, for the Serenade in E Flat and the Suite in B Flat, both works that put Strauss on the map when he was in his late teens. The Serenade's dark colouring sounds Tchaikovskian here. The Suite reveals debts to Brahms that Strauss would later repudiate. But the self-deprecating wit of many of his mature works is also present in spades. Beautiful and hugely recommended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
