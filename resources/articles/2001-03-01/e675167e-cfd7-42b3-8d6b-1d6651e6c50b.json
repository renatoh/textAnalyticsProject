Ms Widdecombe, who as shadow home secretary could in theory be the guardian of the nation's public order after the next election, made the protest to draw attention to the last-minute changes the government wanted to make to its legislation. Ten minutes before the bill had to finish its scrutiny by a committee of MPs if it was to meet its tight timetable to reach the statute book before a likely May election, Ms Wid decombe, accompanied by three Conservative whips, walked silently into the committee room and sat down. This seemingly innocent exercise was, in the arcane ways of parliament, nearly as dramatic a gesture as Michael Heseltine's 25 years ago when he waved the mace in the Commons chamber. That protest was also against an allegedly overmighty Labour executive treating the Commons with disrespect. MPs who are not members of the committee are not allowed to sit in on it. The rebels' action - believed to have been the idea of the chief whip, James Arbuthnot , who led a similar protest some years ago - forced the embarrassed (Conservative) chairman, Roger Gale, to suspend the sitting. The meeting broke up in disarray. Ms Widdecombe and her accomplices Patrick McLoughlin, James Cran and Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, face disciplinary action by the Commons authorities. Until now, the opposition had been cooperating with the government over the bill which legislates for many of the home secretary Jack Straw's more populist plans such as fixed penalty notices for yobs, tougher restrictions on animal rights protests and giving the police rights to hold DNA samples from people not convicted of a crime. But, according to Miss Widdecombe, on the final afternoon of scrutiny, the government was proposing - on top of 56 clauses already down for debate - also discussing 10 government and 42 opposition amendments and six schedules. The session had to finish at 7pm. An unrepentant Miss Widdecombe said later: \"This was not a challenge to the House of Commons. We are challenging this government's contempt for the House of Commons. We can't make them give us time to debate this bill properly, but we can show that if you treat parliament with contempt, this is what you can expect.\" Charles Clarke, the home office minister in charge of the bill, called it \"pantomime politics\". \"This demonstrates that they are not fit to be in opposition, never mind government.\" He said the protest would make it less likely that the bill would be fully debated. But he said the final stages of the bill would be reached in time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
