The coach, identified as Gerrel Williams by Yahoo Sports, was filmed striking one of his players twice at halftime of the game on Monday at the American Youth Football National Championships in Kissimmee, Florida. Williams was the coach of the Savannah Gators, an under-nines team from Georgia. The first blow was hard enough to knock the child off balance, while the second sent him to the ground. The AYF has banned Williams for life and said his actions were a \u201ccomplete breach\u201d of its code of conduct, which prohibits physical and verbal abuse. The victim\u2019s mother did not want to press charges and told the Savannah Morning News \u201cthat none of these coaches would harm [the] kids\u201d. Williams posted a video of himself apologising on Facebook on Wednesday. \u201cAt the end of the day, I apologise to him, the kids, the city \u2026 and my family back at home,\u201d he said. \u201cI do apologise. There\u2019s no excuse for my actions. I hope he forgives me, and his parents have forgiven me.\u201d Williams has also been fired from his job as a counsellor at a Georgia detention centre. \u201cWe reviewed the video, we did an internal investigation, we brought him in, we interviewed him, and he is no longer employed,\u201d a spokeswoman for Chatham county sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cWe do not condone that type of behavior.\u201d A video of the incident on Twitter has been viewed millions of times and caught the attention of figures such as the NBA superstar LeBron James. \u201cAin\u2019t no way!! Couldn\u2019t be my kid. Hell if I there and it\u2019s not even my kid we gone have more than words for sure,\u201d wrote James on Instagram."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
