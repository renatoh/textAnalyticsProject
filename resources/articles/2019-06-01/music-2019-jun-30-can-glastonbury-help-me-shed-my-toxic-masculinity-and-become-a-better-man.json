But who needs Michael \u201cVenom\u201d Page when you have British singer-rapper Rowdy Superstar? As a throbbing bassline makes the comfy leather sofas at the back of the room vibrate, Superstar performs a distorted ritualistic dance on stage while burning fresh sage. This is Shed, a new addition to Glastonbury, and one that aims to fight toxic masculinity and bolster the #MeToo movement by turning blokes into better sons, fathers and lovers. Organised by award-winning online mag The Book of Man, it is a sort of #MenToo, if you like, and blazing herbs is not the only weapon in its arsenal. The exterior of Shed is just that: bits of sheds, the traditional refuge for a certain type of man, cobbled together into a facade. The idea is that old notions of masculinity are \u201cshed\u201d as you step inside the space at the entrance to the Shangri-La area, to be greeted by slogans such as: \u201cNever underestimate your strength. Never overestimate your weakness.\u201d Another advises: \u201cYour best teacher is your last mistake.\u201d They\u2019re all on vibrant rectangles of colour, and are the work of Adam Neate, a British artist who went to live in Brazil after burning all his work. \u201cThis is his first text work,\u201d says Moses Powers, art director of Shangri-La. \u201cHis stuff is usually quite dark, but these hold a nice energy.\u201d Leaning back in the sofa, Powers adds: \u201cShed is a bit of an experiment, a response to the fact that a lot of guys are a bit lost. They feel woke, but want to know how they move forward.\u201d Which could apply to me, I suppose, as a supporter of this march for equality, but one who can\u2019t help feeling something of a bystander. So can I, a middle-aged man with a (possible) tendency to mansplain, get a detox at Shed? Well, I certainly find Professor Green, the rapper and TV personality who speaks as part of a panel, entertaining. \u201cI grew up in Hackney,\u201d he tells a packed room, \u201cand I used to rollerblade. I\u2019d dress normally then get into my baggies when I got to the place. And I had to hide the fact that I loved Skunk Anansie. But I think that\u2019s changing. Nowadays, you can get robbed by someone wearing a Supreme top.\u201d Also on the panel is Krissi Murison, the former editor of NME, who talks about how she came up against the notion of music being deemed \u201ca man\u2019s issue\u201d. She recalls a newspaper article written during the heyday of lads\u2019 mags, in which their various editors were interviewed. \u201cThe way they talked about women,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cWe were basically pieces of meat. So bloody hell, we\u2019ve come so far.\u201d But Murison counters this by talking about \u201cporn culture\u201d and its boom online. \u201cMisogyny doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she says. \u201cIt mutates.\u201d As the panel starts to find its stride, Jordan Stephens, one half of Rizzle Kicks, mentions a train journey, on which he found himself sitting with three young drunk guys. \u201cOne of them was talking about how he\u2019d changed his life by meditating by the sea. And his friend said to him: \u2018Mate, I\u2019ll meditate when I\u2019m dead.\u2019 Just think about those words. That\u2019s what we need to change.\u201d As the panel moves on to talking about the dangers of preaching only to the converted, two young men stagger in and ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d \u201cPositive masculinity workshop,\u201d I say and pat the vacant space on the sofa beside me. \u201cShite,\u201d says one of them and they head back out. I spend a good bit of time in Shed and I\u2019ve never been hugged so much in my life. But does it make me, in the words of Powers, \u201ca better ally to women\u201d? As I step back out into the afternoon sun, and the melee, feeling woke in my flowery shirt and biodegradable glitter, I am certainly determined to put one slogan \u2013 \u201cBeing kind is never wasted\u201d \u2013 into action. But I\u2019m not quite as woke, perhaps, as the guy in purple fishscale swimming trunks and silk paisley-pattern dressing gown dancing to Craig Charles\u2019s set on the main Shangri-La stage. When I get back to my tent later, it is dark and there is a woman face down on the grass outside. \u201cJust leave me,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re fine now,\u201d I say, \u201cbut you\u2019ll be cold in a while. Let me take you back to your tent.\u201d Eventually, she gets up and I help her find her way through the night. As the party of Glastonbury booms in the distance, I recall another Shed slogan. \u201cIt\u2019s not whether you get knocked down,\u201d the words read, on a happy blue background. \u201cIt\u2019s whether you get up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
