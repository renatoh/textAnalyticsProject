As December ends, here are my awards for the best and worst of 2001. Best player A hair's breadth ahead of Thierry Henry comes Michael Owen. His goal record was phenomenal and Liverpool won their trophies mainly on the back of that. His game got better, not least his left foot, and although there are two areas he needs to improve to be an absolute all-time player, I get the feeling he's a lad who'll work at them. He's not as cunning with his movement in the box as, for example, Gary Lineker was, and he can still get tidier with his link-up play. The link-up play has improved, though, because I remember talking to the Liverpool staff after he scored a hat-trick against Sheffield Wednesday when I was in charge in 1998. I was eulogising about him and they said he had plenty to do on that part of his game. Best newcomer Ashley Cole takes some beating. He made the left-back slot his own at Arsenal and broke into the England team without looking out of place. To come in and do the job he has in massive matches takes a lot of character. He's had his downs and has been criticised for some of his defending, but that's very much an area he can be taught. Terry Cooper, one of England's finest left-backs, had things levelled against him defensively but was so effective going the other way and developed the defensive knack with experience. Running Cole close are Liverpool's Jon Arne Riise and West Ham's Jermain Defoe. Best goal For sheer drama it goes to David Beckham's last-minute free-kick against Greece. There was so much hanging on it and he tucked it away brilliantly. Who knows what might have happened if that hadn't gone in? We might have played Ukraine in a play-off and been stuffed. Worst miss Has to go to Sebastian Deisler for somehow wasting the chance to put Germany 2-1 up against England in Munich. He didn't even have the keeper to beat and sidefooted over the bar. If he had scored, the game would have swung psychologically to the Germans. England might have gone in at half-time looking down the barrel and how would they have reacted then? Best signing I'm glad Manchester United signed Juan Sebastian Veron because I could watch him all day, but Teddy Sheringham gets my vote just above Ruud van Nistelrooy. Sheringham has given Spurs a lot of quality and credibility and is a great free transfer. I think he's focal to the way Glenn Hoddle wants to play and has given Les Ferdinand a new lease of life. Others contenders would be Craig Bellamy, who's a different player at Newcastle after Coventry, and Fabrizio Ravanelli, Derby's best chance of avoiding the drop. Worst signing Corrado Grabbi hasn't produced the goods for Blackburn at \u00a36.75m and Junichi Inamoto has made no impact at Arsenal since his \u00a34m move from Japan. But the biggest flop has to be Bosko Balaban, the Croatia striker who cost Aston Villa \u00a36m in the summer. He hasn't started a Premiership game and doesn't even always get on the bench. At least he can take heart from his club-mate Juan Pablo Angel. The Colombian looked an out-and-out certainty to win this award at the turn of the year and has turned things round. Best team Manchester United were the country's most impressive team at their best but the prize goes to Liverpool for winning the Worthington Cup, FA Cup, Uefa Cup, Charity Shield and Super Cup. They became harder to beat and more resilient, if not always easy on the eye. The success has given them the springboard and belief to make a serious title challenge and I think they'll open up and show more flair as they develop. They certainly have the players in the camp. Best manager George Burley would be close for what he achieved last season, when I thought Ipswich would be relegated. Jean Tigana has done well at Fulham and Sven-Goran Eriksson did brilliantly to pull England round. But G\u00e9rard Houllier gets the nod for the trophies he brought Liverpool. His illness proved how much he put into trying to restore their former glories. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
