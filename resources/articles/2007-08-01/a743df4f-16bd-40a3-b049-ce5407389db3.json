The centre-half was forced to watch yesterday's Community Shield game from the sidelines after suffering the injury during Chelsea's last training session at Cobham on Saturday. He has undergone a scan and the club are monitoring the damage to the ligaments; the England manager, Steve McClaren, is due to telephone his captain for a fitness update this week. Confirmation that Terry will be absent for the start of the Premier League season comes as a blow to Chelsea, who surrendered nine points in their defender's eight-game absence from December to February last season, a deficit they never clawed back from United. However, the implications are just as serious for England and McClaren, who is without Ledley King with a knee problem, most likely until October, as Jamie Carragher considers his future with the national team. England are playing catch-up in their qualifying group, with the emphasis on the games against Israel and Russia in which they cannot afford to drop points. Before then they play Germany this month, with McClaren facing the prospect of being without both his current captain and Terry's predecessor, David Beckham. The LA Galaxy midfielder said over the weekend that he would need to play \"a few games\" for his new club before he considered making himself available for his country as he struggles with an ankle injury sustained on England duty in Estonia in June. Beckham has yet to train fully with his new team and is unlikely to play in Thursday's MLS match against DC United; McClaren is set to abandon plans to travel to the US to watch that game. \"All that's on my mind is getting myself fit,\" said Beckham. \"If I'm fit I have to play a few games before I even think about going home to England.\" With Terry now injured, Chelsea's players may be dropping like flies but the team's resilience remains. Jose Mourinho refused to talk about specific injuries in the wake of his side's defeat yesterday, although according to the Portuguese \"more than 50% of my team was missing\". Plans for a more expansive approach may have to be shelved for now; already the priority appears to be survival once again. Mourinho would hope that, in Tal Ben Haim and the Brazilian Alex, Chelsea boast more cover at centre-back in Terry's absence. Yet the current injury list is threatening to wreck his entire side. Didier Drogba has damaged knee cartilage and, while the club awaits the results of yet more scans, is unlikely to feature for another 10 days, effectively ruling him out of Chelsea's first two games of the season, against Birmingham and Reading. Arjen Robben, Paulo Ferreira and Claude Makelele have knee injuries, and Andriy Shevchenko (back) and Salomon Kalou (shoulder) are doubtful for the start of the season. Wayne Bridge (hip) and Michael Ballack (ankle) are out, Frank Lampard is playing with a broken toe and Michael Essien has struggled with knee problems. Given his limited outfield options, Mourinho fielded two goalkeepers on the bench yesterday and still had a quartet of players nursing knocks when they retired to the dressing rooms at half-time. The manager, though, was ebullient. \"What makes me really happy and confident today is that, on one side out there, was a team almost at the maximum of their power, certainly if you look at the Manchester United team from last season,\" he said. \"And, if you look at the Chelsea team, more than 50% of the team was missing but United were not better than us.\" Regardless, there will be concern at Stamford Bridge that injuries are eating into their prospects. \"I am not worried,\" said Mourinho. \"We had no defensive or technical problems [against United yesterday] and, even without a striker, the three boys in our attack gave us life, speed and dynamism. Eventually I want to play 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 with two lines, two wide people, all the time. But we have to adapt in relation to the players we have available. We did that well today.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
