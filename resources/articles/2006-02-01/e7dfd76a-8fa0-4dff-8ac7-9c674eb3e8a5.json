The original 1971 Animals Act made the owner of a \"dangerous\" animal liable for any harm or damage it caused, but a judgment in 2003 widened liability to cover owners of \"normal\" animals behaving in a way typical of their species. This meant a horse business might take every reasonable precaution but still be liable if, for example, a horse bolted after being spooked. The ruling followed the case in which a driver was seriously injured when horses escaped from a field after being frightened. Stable owners complain that, as more and more riders make business-threatening claims, saying they have taken all possible precautions in an increasingly worthless defence. The ruling may also have consequences for farmers. An example may be if a cow acts aggressively to protect its calf and injures a dog walker. David Fursdon, president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), said: \"As agriculture profits decline, the equine sector is an increasingly important diversification option for rural businesses. The interpretation of the act is effectively creating liability without fault.\" Stephen Crabb, Conservative MP for Preseli, Pembrokeshire, whose parliamentary early day motion to highlight the issue has been backed by 29 other MPs, agreed. \"The margins some of these businesses operate on are very, very thin. A lot are run by people who are enthusiasts themselves but any increase in their cost base destroys the economic case,\" he said. Defra, the rural affairs department, is worried too. It is investigating whether amendments could be made to the government's compensation bill, which is going through parliament, to remedy the problem. Ministers are eager to prove their rural credentials following the furore over hunting and delays in European Union subsidies for farmers, and they do not want riding to become the preserve of the rich as stables and trekking centres raise charges to cover their costs. A Defra spokeswoman said: \"We have given a commitment to explore what we can do to resolve this issue.\" Ingrid Evans, who owns Llanwnda stables, near Goodwick in Wales, said premiums for her business had risen from \u00a3858 in 2001 to \u00a37,051, forcing her to increase charges. \"I had to, otherwise I would have closed. I think there are some families who do not ride anymore because it is now beyond their budget.\" Marion Pendlebury, at the Pen-Lleyn Lusitano stud and riding centre, near Pwllheli, Gwynedd, said: \"If we want to ride horses, or do any other risk sport, we are going to have to take responsibility for our own actions and not be encouraged to 'blame and claim', or there will be nowhere left to do anything.\" The insurance industry has suggested other reasons for the high premiums, including fewer insurers in the market. There are 2.4 million riders and up to 1 million horses in Britain. In all, the equine industry, including racing, supports up to 250,000 jobs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
