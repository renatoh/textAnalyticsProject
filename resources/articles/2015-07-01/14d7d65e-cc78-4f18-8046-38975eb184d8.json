On the eve his second match at these championships \u2013 against Robin Haase first-up on Court No 1 on Thursday \u2013 the Scot has entered the rolling debate on coaches illegally signalling tactics and advice to their players and, typically, he comes at it from an odd angle. He would not be drawn into criticising other players but told a story from his teenage days in Spain that shines an interesting light on a serious subject. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to speak about other players because I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when I was a junior, one of the coaches Pato [\u00c1lvarez] that I used to work with used to do signals to a lot of his players. \u201cI was playing a futures tournament when I was about 16 out in Spain. I won the match but it was close, not a very good match. And he went: \u2018Andy, what are you doing? You never listen to me when you are on the court.\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 He said: \u2018I was telling you to serve and volley and you weren\u2019t doing it.\u2019 I was, like: \u2018You never told me what the signals were.\u2019 \u201cHe was there at the back of the court telling me what to do and I didn\u2019t know. He is the only coach that I have ever worked with [to do that]. Since I have been on the tour none of the coaches I have been with have ever given me any hand signals, or anything like that. \u201cIvan Lendl didn\u2019t say a word, really, when I was playing matches and, no, I have not had that since I have been on the tour. I don\u2019t think I have ever had a coaching warning. It\u2019s possible but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He might not need anything more than encouragement against Haase, whom he has beaten three times out of four, but he will hardly disregard the danger posed by a player who has taken a set off him in each of their two US Open matches. \u201cI was cramping after an hour and 15 minutes [when they last played there, in the first round last year]. Idon\u2019t know how I managed to come through that match, to be honest. The time when I played him before in New York [in 2011], he was coming in to it having played very well.\u201d Murray and Haase have slightly differing recollections of their history, the Dutchman saying he never played him as a junior, while the Scot does remember him being around at that time of their development. \u201cHe is someone I grew up with, in juniors and stuff like that. He likes playing on the big courts as well. He goes for it, which makes things tough. I don\u2019t know him unbelievably well. He is quiet off the court, but on it he is quite loud and open and emotional. So it should be a fun match.\u201d Murray says he has been turning to the snooker table to relax between matches, alongside Ross Hutchins and the Delgado brothers, a habit he picked up during his spells of rehab after injury, when he would play his Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith, in Glasgow. \u201cWe get pumped to play,\u201d he says of his time on the tables at the All England Club. \u201cNone of us is any good but it is a fun way to spend time with friends.\u201d Aljaz Bedene and James Ward, meanwhile, have the incentive of moving closer to an all-British fourth tie \u2013 if they can beat Viktor Troicki and Jiri Vesely, respectively. The newest Brit, Bedene, has the tougher task, up against the Queen\u2019s semi-finalist who gave Murray a good argument. He revealed he had a brief phone conversation with his mother after beating Radek Stepanek in the first round. \u201cShe was really happy and proud,\u201d said Bedene, who was born in the old Yugoslavia before Ljubljana became the capital of independent Slovenia and was granted British citizenship in April. \u201cBut she cut the call short because she said I probably had a lot of work to do now. It was only five seconds, but they were really happy. They are on holiday \u2013 I think they followed it on the internet.\u201d Bedene, whose partner is the singer Kimalie, says he is being recognised more often in public lately \u2013 hopefully because of his tennis. \u201cI was talking to Kimalie \u2013 who has been working with Jeff Wayne and they will probably be releasing a song or two this year \u2013 and she said: \u2018Definitely next year it will be different for us,\u2019 and I agree. I still don\u2019t want to be too well-known. I want to be able to enjoy my personal life \u2013 but if it happens, you cannot do anything about it.\u201d Ward\u2019s might be the more straightforward task against the lively young Czech left-hander Vesely, although he invariably views every match as a struggle \u2013 even his win over lucky loser Luca Vanni after the withdrawal through injury of David Ferrer. But the Londoner did take heart from the presence of three other British players in the second round for the first time in 10 years. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s picked their game up, playing well coming into the tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s ranking is improving. It\u2019s good to have a few more guys playing well and winning matches. You just keep knocking at the door.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
