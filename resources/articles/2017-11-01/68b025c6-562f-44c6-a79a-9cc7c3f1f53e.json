Instead \u2013 as with all of the songs on If All I Was Was Black \u2013 it replaces mockery and fury with a warm, calm clarity that is soothing and stirring. Staples explains how it feels to be judged by the colour of your skin (and, on other tracks, the effects of police brutality and internalised oppression) with a patience and simplicity that is heartrending. That the songs on the record, which largely deals with race and oppression, were written by a white man could have undercut the emotional heft. (That man being Wilco\u2019s Jeff Tweedy, a longtime collaborator of Staples, who soundtracks his words with a weighty marriage of gospel and blues rock.) But Staples has had decades of practice delivering truths as part of the Staple Singers \u2013 who were celebrated for their gospel \u201cmessage songs\u201d \u2013 and her performance here is so utterly convincing it feels like a moot point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
