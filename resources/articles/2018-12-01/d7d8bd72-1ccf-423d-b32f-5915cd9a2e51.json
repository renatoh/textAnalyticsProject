It\u2019s been memorable. Bye! Rodgers also says that they haven\u2019t yet ascertained the severity of Ryan Christie\u2019s injury. He\u2019ll presumably be off for x-rays. Here\u2019s Brendan Rodgers: I think there\u2019s always mixed emotions when you lose a game, but this campaign was over the course of six games. See how tough the group is. To get through above Leipzig, it\u2019s been an absolutely brilliant effort by the players. I\u2019m so, so proud of them, and obviously we deserved to get there because we finished second. Tonight was frustrating. We didn\u2019t play well, we didn\u2019t play well at all. We didn\u2019t build the game well enough from the back. We had too many touches in midfield and we lacked quality. From a performance perspective, I was disappointed. But they\u2019re a good side. They\u2019ve spent their money very well. But the campaign ended tonight in terms of qualification, and we\u2019re through. We were hanging in there. Craig made some great saves. We were poor on the ball. Technically we weren\u2019t good at all. We looked a little bit leggy. We\u2019re also a team that, we need our best players available to have any sort of chance at this level. It\u2019s very difficult [the next round]. That\u2019s the reality of it. We\u2019re into the last 32, which is progress for us this season. We\u2019ll reflect on the performance, where we can be better, and congratulate Salzburg, a very, very good side. Here\u2019s Ewan Murray\u2019s match report from Celtic Park: Celtic, despite this loss, somehow managed to advance to the last 32 of the Europa League after Rosenborg\u2019s draw at Leipzig in Group B\u2019s other game. Olivier Ntcham\u2019s goal, after his penalty was saved, proved immaterial as the crowd were busy celebrating the draw elsewhere. More here: Marco Rose, the Salzburg manager, has got a Celtic scarf and hat on and is posing for selfies with home fans. Like you do. Craig Gordon talks about the second Salzburg goal. He was expecting Wolf to stop closing him down once he collected the ball and head back to the half-way line, and was caught out when he didn\u2019t: That doesn\u2019t happen very often, that a player comes to close that down. That hardly ever happens. I think I\u2019ve only seen it happen once before. Normally they turn around and go back. I\u2019m annoyed about it, but it sometimes happens in football. That moment is a bit of a blow. Sometimes these things happen in football, and I\u2019m just so grateful that it hasn\u2019t stopped us going through. Don\u2019t try this at home: Celtic had some rough luck with injuries, but they were outplayed for most of the match, had four shots on target (of which two were from the penalty that led to their goal) and deservedly lost. But sod it, they\u2019re through. High fives and fist-bumps all round at the end, as Salzburg celebrate a 100% group stage campaign, and Celtic celebrate an incredible let-off. 90+8 mins: The crowd roars, as Celtic are beaten 2-1 and it doesn\u2019t matter! 90+7 mins: Here\u2019s the goal that saw Celtic through: 90+6 mins: It\u2019s all over in Germany, and Celtic are through! The penalty is well saved by Walke, but Ntcham gets to the rebound first, and rolls it in the other side! 90+5 mins: Benkovic is brought down, and the referee points to the spot! 90+4 mins: Now they\u2019re wasting time by the corner flag at the other end. 90+4 mins: Which they\u2019re in no hurry to take. They are basically playing for Celtic now (and doing better at it than the actual Celtic are). 90+3 mins: I now have both games on, and in Leipzig Rosenborg have a goal kick. 90+1 mins: There will be seven minutes of stoppage time here, and four in Leipzig. 90 mins: Salzburg bring on Smail Prevljak, replacing Dabbur. 89 mins: They\u2019ve had a shot on target now! Ntcham\u2019s free-kick is heading for the top corner, but Walke gets a glove to it! 88 mins: The home fans are cheering this as if it\u2019s a victory, roaring their side home (to defeat). 88 mins: Ramalho fouls Rogic, and is booked. 87 mins: Roars around the ground as news filters through. Celtic are going through as it stands! 86 mins: Hang on! 84 mins: Impossible miss! Remarkable! Benkovic flicks the ball on at the near post and at the far post Ajer has a tap-in from practically under the bar and somehow contrives to spoon it over! 83 mins: McGregor blasts the ball into Samassekou, earning his side a corner. 82 mins: Edouard has just touched the ball without giving it away, so that\u2019s something. Celtic have so far had two shots (none on target), while Salzburg have had 16 (six on target). 80 mins: Salzburg bring Christoph Leitgeb on for Mwepu. 79 mins: And that, surely, is that. A catastrophic error. Karius-esque. Gordon, who has had a brilliant game, makes a ludicrous, disastrous mistake! He collects a long ball out of defence from Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 and tries to immediately bowl it out again, but Gulbrandsen anticipates, sticks a foot out, get contact on the ball and is left with a tap in! 74 mins: Salzburg bring on Fredrik Gulbrandsen, and take off Minamino. 72 mins: A big chance for a second! The ball comes in from the left, is headed back across goal, Lainer heads it down and Samassekou\u2019s point-blank effort hits Gordon and goes over! I thought Lainer had given Edouard a shove as the ball came towards them, but the referee didn\u2019t spot it. 70 mins: Frankly Celtic are fortunate to only be a goal down, and but a single strike from European survival, with plenty of time to find one. \u201cMwepu\u2019s grew so tired of the mentions that he died in May 2015...\u201d says Edward Chukwurah of Mwepu Ilunga (see half-time video). 69 mins: As it stands, then, Celtic are out, and Leipzig are through in second place. 68 mins: It looks like Ramalho was hit by an object thrown from the stands as the away team celebrated their goal. He returns for the centre rubbing his head. The breakthrough! And that is simplicity itself. Lainer\u2019s cross is excellent, Dabbur is between two defenders and his header flies into the net off Gordon\u2019s knee! 66 mins: Celtic attack, Tierney gets into space on the left, and his low cross is messily but eventually cleared. 65 mins: McGregor plays the ball through to Edouard, one on one with a defender and with nothing but green grass, Alexander Walke and goal behind him. He runs straight into the defender. 62 mins: Action has resumed in a similar vein to before. Celtic are almost holding their own now, though, at least until the ball gets to Edouard, who has been completely hopeless so far. 58 mins: Christie is finally carried down the tunnel, and Ntcham is on. 57 mins: Medical staff continue to treat Christie. With Ntcham\u2019s arrival Celtic will have used all three substitutes, with a little over half an hour and a good chunk of stoppage time to play. 55 mins: The stretcher is on, and Olivier Ntcham is preparing to do so too. 54 mins: Christie is sitting up now, but he still looks to be in a lot of pain. 53 mins: Christie slides in brilliantly to dispossess Minamino as the Salzburg forward prepares to shoot, but he immediately starts writhing about and he is evidently in considerable pain. 52 mins: This one is headed on by Benkovic, at the near post this time, and it floats towards Ajer. For a moment it looks like he\u2019s going to have a tap-in at the back stick, but a defender gets to it first. 51 mins: And Brown now starts the move that ends with Forrest winning a corner. They try a clever routine, which ends with Benkovic, beyond the far post, heading back across but only to a Salzburg player. Benkovic wins it back, though, and wins another corner. 50 mins: Brown is precisely the player Celtic need, namely one that doesn\u2019t give the ball away unnecessarily in important areas. 49 mins: Bad news for Celtic. Leipzig are leading Rosenborg, and Celtic can no longer afford to lose. 47 mins: Simunovic gives the ball away on the edge of their own area, but Dabbur\u2019s shot smacks a defender in the face and bounces to safety. 46 mins: Celtic have taken off one Scott, Sinclair, and brought on another, Brown. Sinclair was poor in the first half. 46 mins: Peeeep! Salzburg get the second half started. The presence of Enock Mwepu reminds me, inevitably, of the greatest Mwepu in football history. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very tired of this being mentioned, but I for one never will be: \u201cI hate to sound biased,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u201cbut maybe the Celtic players should drink some Red Bull at half time!\u201d It has been a really fast-paced and entertaining match. Given that Salzburg can happily lose and still stroll through as group winners, their attitude has been admirable. 45+4 mins: Celtic have been poor, Salzburg have been excellent, but somehow it remains goalless. 45+2 mins: A Celtic attack ends with Sinclair delaying his pass inside and then hitting it behind Rogic. They get the ball back, return it to Sinclair, and this time he crosses straight out of play. 45+2 mins: Meanwhile in Leipzig it\u2019s half-time, and goalless. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time we roar, and there will be about three minutes of it. 45 mins: Good work from Forrest, who has been Celtic\u2019s brightest attacking hope, but then he passes to Edouard, who attempts a stepover and accidentally send the ball bouncing to the keeper. 42 mins: Another Salzburg corner, and Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9, having hit the bar earlier, heads wide this time. 41 mins: A chance for Celtic! Forest crosses low and hard from the right, but Sinclair doesn\u2019t anticipate it, can\u2019t reach it, and the ball keeps going for a Salzburg throw. 40 mins: Celtic are having a brief spell of not-that-badness. Edouard is a bit of a clumsy possession-surrender expert, though. 36 mins: Rogic takes control of the ball midway through Celtic\u2019s half and bursts forward, before picking out Edouard with a crossfield pass. His control, though, is poor, and the ball bounces straight to Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9. 34 mins: On BT Sport, Chris Sutton says Celtic have so far been \u201coutrun, outfought, outclassed\u201d. 33 mins: A delay, because Ramalho\u2019s boot has come off and he can\u2019t untie his laces to put it back on again. Eventually the referee has to come over and help him. 31 mins: What a save from Gordon! Celtic give the ball away inside their own half, Wolf runs through, and just about evades Simunovic\u2019s desperate diving lunge, but as Gordon runs out he doesn\u2019t lift the ball over him, or take the ball around him, he just slides it right into him. A fine bit of goalkeeping, but he shouldn\u2019t have had a chance. 30 mins: And that\u2019s a lovely challenge from Ajer, who flings himself in the way to stop Minamino tapping in a cross from the right. 29 mins: Celtic do an attack! They move the ball well down the right, but then the low cross goes straight to a defender. 27 mins: So far Salzburg have had seven shots and five corners. Celtic are yet to have any of either. 25 mins: Salzburg win another corner. This looks like it might be a long night for Celtic, though importantly Leipzig and Rosenborg are still drawing 0-0, and for as long as that\u2019s the case Celtic are safe. 24 mins: Benkovic goes down very easily as he\u2019s touched on the shoulder by Wolf as the pair prepare to contest a cross, and the referee gives the free kick. 22 mins: Another Salzburg attack, though this time the closest they come to scoring is Ulmer\u2019s volleyed cross-shot, which looked unlikely to go in and was anyway palmed away by Gordon. 22 mins: Celtic haven\u2019t been more than 10 yards inside the Salzburg half in the last 10 minutes or so. 20 mins: Celtic are taking off their captain, Lustig going off and Ajer coming on. 19 mins: Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 is booked for taking out Edouard as Celtic try to counter. 17 mins: And they so nearly score! The cross comes to the far post, the header comes in, and with the goalkeeper emphatically beaten it hits the bar, comes down six inches the right side of the line, and bounces away! Then another corner, another header, and Gordon saves well at the near post! 16 mins: A smart move from Salzburg ends with Dabbur being dispossessed for a corner. 14 mins: A smart-looking move by Salzburg, as they keep finding a player despite Celtic pressure, though they actually only pass the ball backwards, and eventually Mwepu tonks it into touch. 11 mins: A minor festival of possession-surrender in the middle of the pitch, with Samassekou at its heart, sees the two sides win and lose the ball three times each before it finally runs out of play for a Celtic throw. 11 mins: His game isn\u2019t over, and he\u2019s back on the pitch. 10 mins: Lustig is on his feet, but it looks like his game might be over. 9 mins: Salzburg had a corner, and in competing for a header it looked like Lainer planted an elbow in the back of his head, without apparent malice. 8 mins: Lustig is down inside Celtic\u2019s penalty area and there are a few players gathered around him in apparent concern. 5 mins: Save! A cross from the right, and Januzovic rises 12 yards out and sends a header looping towards the far post, but Gordon tips it over at full stretch! 2 mins: Nearly a chance for Celtic! Sinclair gets down the left and crosses, but it\u2019s just too high for Forrest, who can only get the top of his head to it. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a Buquet on the pitch and a Rose on the Salzburg bench?\u201d notes Leo Addor. \u201cBy the way, is Marco Rose related to the mayor of Paradise City, Axl?\u201d Enjoyable as it would be if Marco was a sweet child o\u2019his they\u2019re unrelated. 1 min: Peeeeeep! Celtic get us started. Celtic are just huddling, and once they pop out of it we\u2019ll be good to go. And they\u2019re out! The players are in the tunnel. Rangers are out of the Europa League after losing 1-0 at Rapid Vienna. Kick-off at Celtic is 10 minutes away. Rapid Vienna have taken an 84th-minute lead against Rangers, who now need two goals to survive. Follow the latest with Scott Murray here: Important clarification: Ruddy bouquet A collection of red flowers Ruddy Buquet A French referee The team sheets are in, and these are the names upon them: Celtic: Gordon, Lustig, Benkovic, Simunovic, Tierney, Forrest, McGregor, Rogic, Sinclair, Christie, Edouard. Subs: Bain, Izaguirre, Brown, Hayes, Morgan, Ntcham, Ajer. Red Bull Salzburg: Walke, Lainer, Ramalho, Onguene, Ulmer, Mwepu, Samassekou, Wolf, Junuzovic, Minamino, Dabbur. Subs: Stankovic, Prevljak, Daka, Gulbrandsen, Leitgeb, Pongracic, Todorovic. Referee: Ruddy Buquet (France). The good news: Celtic have a 100% home record in the Europa League this season, having beaten both Leipzig and Rosenborg at Celtic Park, and Red Bull Salzburg have no reason to try particularly hard, having already snagged top spot in Group B with a 100% record over their first five games (though unhelpfully their manager, Marco Rose, promises his side will \u201cgive everything\u201d). On the downside, Red Bull are good enough to have a 100% record after five games, and with Leipzig three points behind, with superior goal difference and at home to pointless Rosenborg, defeat is likely to spell elimination. Celtic have won 10 and drawn two of the 10 games they have played since their visit to Leipzig in late October, and 12 of the 13 games since they lost in Salzburg at the start of that month, and thus go into the game in the finest of fettle. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be really tough against a top-class side. But we get the chance to show the great confidence and belief we\u2019ve had from virtually just after the game when we played them,\u201d says Brendan Rodgers. So will this be a dreary encounter between a team that only needs to draw and one that doesn\u2019t need anything? Or will it be a humdinger between a goal-friendly Salzburg side, undefeated since May and playing with no pressure, and a Celtic side forced to go for broke? Time alone will tell. Until then, hello! And here\u2019s the league table:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
