The Swiss bank has already lost billions of euros in the credit crunch but could be forced to cut costs as the financial crisis enters its latest and potentially most damaging phase, a source has told the Guardian. Many of the cuts could be felt in Britain, where UBS employs about 9,000 people, and would deal a fresh blow to the City of London, where the bulk of employees work. Last week Barclays cut more than 5,000 jobs worldwide, many of which will be lost in the City. UBS employed 78,000 before the crisis took hold and last year cut about 900 jobs in London, about 10% of its UK staff. There were reports incuts the Swiss press that UBS was planning to cut as many as 5,000 jobs. The bank, which is expected to release fourth-quarter results on 10 February, declined to comment on the reports. The news came as a study by the US investment bank JP Morgan said that job losses in the City, which employs about 300,000 people, could reach 40,000. About 40,000 British companies are expected to go bust this year, a 35% increase over last year, according to the credit management research centre at Leeds University business school. The failure rate could continue next year, the CMRC said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
