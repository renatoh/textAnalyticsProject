Chambers, one of Britain's best hopes of a medal at this summer's Olympics, was also handed a lifetime ban from the games. UK Athletics delivered their verdict today following last Thursday's hearing. The sport's governing body gave the sprinter 60 days to appeal. A statement released on behalf of Dwain Chambers this afternoon said: \"Dwain has always and continues to assert that he has never knowingly taken a performance-enhancing substance. \"Dwain was charged with taking a substance which was not listed as a banned substance but which fell within the 'catch-all' provision of the Iaaf Rules as being either chemically or pharmacologically related to a banned substance. \"Dwain's challenge to UK Athletics and the Iaaf allegations regarding THG focused on the fact that although there was scientific evidence to show that THG was chemically related to banned substances, this in itself could not be sufficient to constitute a doping offence. \"Dwain's challenge has been unsuccessful. However, the tribunal noted that there was no clinical evidence of anabolic or performance-enhancing effect of THG in the human body. \"Further, the tribunal noted that no evidence was produced - nor indeed was it even suggested by UK Athletics - that Dwain was knowingly or intentionally involved with THG. \"Dwain has been given the minimum ban available in the circumstances and he continues to assert his innocence. \"The decision of the tribunal is being studied in detail for the purpose of considering a possible appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\" UK Athletics chief executive, David Moorcroft, said: \"UK Athletics are proud of the fact that we conduct a full programme of in and out-of-competition testing alongside targeted testing to ensure we do all we can to protect those athletes who compete fairly. \"We are mindful of the fact that this may lead to adverse findings and that publicity resulting from a positive finding can hurt the sport, but we feel this is a price worth paying to keep the sport clean.\" Chambers tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid in August 2003 and the ban will be backdated to November 7, when he was originally suspended. UK Athletics used four expert witnesses to give evidence against Chambers at the hearing, including US Anti-doping Agency scientist Larry Bowers and Don Catlin, the director whose laboratory discovered THG. A statement from UK Athletics on the disciplinary hearing read: \"Dwain Chambers co-operated with UK Athletics during the hearing process and accepted many issues in relation to his case. \"The disciplinary committee had only therefore to deal with legal arguments and complex scientific issues as to whether THG was in fact a prohibited substance. THG is not specifically listed on the IAAF's list of prohibited substances. The disciplinary committee had to decide whether THG was chemically or pharmacologically related to a substance on the IAAF's list of banned substances. \"Dwain Chambers accepted the chemical relationship but he argued that it was necessary for UK Athletics to prove a pharmacological relationship too. The disciplinary committee was satisfied that UK Athletics had proved that the relationship was made out and that THG was chemically and pharmacologically related to gestrinone.\" The sprinter joins a host of British athletes who have failed drugs tests. Former Olympic and world 100m gold medallist Linford Christie, who shares the European record with Chambers, was the previous biggest name on the list. But Christie was in semi-retirement when he tested positive for the controversial drug nandrolone in 1999. He has now returned to the sport as a coach. The same substance caught out 400m runner Mark Richardson at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Polevaulter Janine Whitlock, who set 36 British records in the event, is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for the anabolic steroid dianabol. Whitlock, who claimed her drink was spiked, will be free to compete next year, but is banned from the 2004 games in Athens under British Olympic Association rules. Shotputter Paul Edwards is still fighting a life ban for taking steroids almost 10 years after being sent home from the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada. Discus thrower Perriss Wilkins was banned for life this year after a second doping offence, but had it commuted to four years on appeal to the Court for Arbitration In Sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
