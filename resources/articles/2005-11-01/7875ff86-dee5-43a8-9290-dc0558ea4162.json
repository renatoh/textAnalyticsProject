Research shows the Tibetan plateau is surrounded by a ring of ozone in comparable concentration to that in a heavily-polluted city, putting climbers at risk . For mountaineers struggling up the biggest Himalayan peaks such as Everest and K2, this extra dose of ozone could be devastating. \"Ozone is very unstable and reacts with any surface of substance. Breathing high concentrations of ozone causes coughing, chest pain and damage to the lining throughout the lung,\" said John Semple, a plastic surgeon from the University of Toronto, and a keen mountaineer who first measured the ozone concentration around the plateau. In autumn last year, Dr Semple was climbing the Yeli La pass in Bhutan while measuring the level of ozone. He found it increased as he climbed. \"Usually pollution gets less as you climb out of it, but in this case the ozone levels increased with height, which was not what we expected,\" said Kent Moore, a physicist at the University of Toronto. Dr Moore looked at satellite measurements of ozone over the plateau for October to November, for the years 1997 to 2004, in an attempt to explain Dr Semple's findings. \"The measurements showed ozone was at a minimum over Tibet, but that around the periphery there was a halo of high ozone values,\" said Dr Moore. The researchers think the odd pattern can be explained by a phenomenon more common in the oceans, a Taylor column. When water passes around a submerged obstacle, like an underwater island, the forked flow pattern continues right up to the surface, leaving a column of stagnant water above the obstacle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
