Ginola, the former France, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United winger, on Friday stated his intention to join Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne as candidates for the Fifa election in May, when Blatter is expected to secure a fifth term in office. The 47-year-old faces numerous challenges, most notably to convince people that he is not part of a grandiose publicity stunt. He must secure the backing of five national federations by 29 January to even be considered a presidential candidate but Ginola conceded that not a single nation had yet to support him. He also failed to name a single member of Fifa\u2019s executive committee when questioned during a press conference, although seemed to have genuine intentions to change the world game for good. \u201cDo you know how many hours I spent to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI could be in the south of France with my friends. It\u2019s a hard job. The money is not everything, you have to understand that money is not everything. Obviously you have to be paid for the things you do, but it is about emotional feelings. \u201cTo have a fair game you have to have a bunch of guys who represent different worlds and different approaches. I\u2019ve never worked for Fifa, I am a brand new guy on the stage. Let\u2019s have a new voice. I need to know a lot more about Fifa. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge task, that\u2019s why we\u2019re probably very late in the campaign process. I had to think twice. For me being here today is a huge task. It\u2019s a fantastic challenge. I want to show and set an example to all the former players around me to say that we have a say in football \u2013 don\u2019t let other people decide what is good and what is bad for the game.\u201d Ginola, who did not present an election manifesto or name any policies he would put in place as Fifa president, has been paid \u00a3250,000 by Paddy Power. The bookmaker has set up a website for public donations towards Ginola\u2019s campaign and has set a fundraising target of \u00a32.3m. Ginola will be paid the full \u00a3250,000 fee even if his campaign fails to get beyond the end of January. Ginola will receive 10% of all pledges if they surpass \u00a31m. A breakdown of costs was published on Friday and the budget included \u00a3565,000 for advertising and \u00a3100,000 for security. Ginola, who was part of England\u2019s ill-fated bid team for the 2018 World Cup, has the backing of the online protest group Change Fifa. He added: \u201cDo you want someone who has worked with Fifa already? Who is still working with Fifa? I have a clear mind, I want to achieve things, being seen as someone who brought some freshness and relief for how football should be treated. We want to reboot football so there is no space for controversy any more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
