I asked a plastic crystal ball supplied by accountant Grant Thornton as an aid to working out what may happen in the Budget. 'Maybe,' it replied. Rumours abound that the Chancellor will throw voters a few inexpensive sweeteners: raising the threshhold for the lowest stamp duty band and tweaking IHT would not cost a lot but would earn brownie points with voters at both ends of the age range. But just in case he is still seeking ways to improve things, here's a reminder of why Cash believes much of IHT law is dead wrong: \u00b7 Heterosexual cohabitees get none of the IHT exemptions given to married couples or, by the end of the year, to gay couples. \u00b7 Beneficiaries often struggle to pay IHT bills because tax bills must be paid before estate assets are released. While there are some exemptions to the rules, some families have to borrow large sums, sell the properties they inherit or put their own houses down as security to pay the tax bill. \u00b7 Although IHT was originally planned as a tax on the rich, it is fast becoming a tax on vast numbers of home owners. One in three homes is on course to be subject to this tax within 20 years. \u00b7 The IHT threshold would now be \u00a3359,000 (36 per cent above the current level) had it kept pace with house price inflation. \u00b7 The tax's punitive nature undermines parents' ability to provide for their children. Brown himself has agreed that IHT in its present form is unfair. He has written: 'If society is to have inheritance tax, it must be operated fairly. Yet at present, while the very wealthy avoid the tax, many others are being drawn into it.' Obviously, most of the people whose estates will be affected are elderly. They have worked and saved hard to pay for their homes. Statistics show they are more likely to vote than younger, less wealthy people. It would be a very unwise politician who ignores this. BANKS and credit card companies are fond of pointing out that they cover losses incurred through fraudulent use of cards and other financial products. But make no mistake, the cost is passed on to cardholders in charges. Then there is the stress of trying to sort out problems caused by fraud. It took HSBC two weeks to restore my colleague Lisa Bachelor's current account to its rightful state after thieves intercepted her new cheque- book in the mail. Nearly \u00a31,000 had been stolen from her account. Yet, as Lisa points out in her article on page 12, some of the biggest banks and credit card companies seem resistant to the simplest ways of solving the problem. OK, collecting your new chequebook or credit card from your local branch might not be as convenient as picking it up off the doormat, but it's a lot easier than contacting numerous departments of your bank or credit card issuer to report the theft and then, because some credit card companies require a crime number, filing a report with the police. Even if most customers reject this solution, they surely couldn't object to calling a free 0800 number to activate their cards. The argument of Apacs, which represents the firms, that banks have had problems with customers not removing the stickers used in this process from their cards before inserting them in an ATM, beggars belief. So does the news that card issuers have not yet decided when to stop retailers accepting signatures rather than PINs. The writing is on the wall. Apacs admits that card issuers are already concerned that customers are being too easily duped by fraudsters in cases of internet 'phishing', and are reviewing losses on a case-by-case basis. How long will it be before they refuse to meet these and other losses - the ones we incur through their sloppiness?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
