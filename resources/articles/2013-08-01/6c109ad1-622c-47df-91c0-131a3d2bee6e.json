A sleazy guitar sound, redolent of early Queens of the Stone Age, allied to an over-friendly bass bobble? That's the catchy Love Illumination, whose lyrical search for \"sweet love\" is undermined by the louche sax. A galumphing glam-funk track whose chorus arrives mere seconds into the verse? That's Right Action, whose video re-employs Jonas Odell, the director who filmed their first hit, Take Me Out. As it is, Franz are 10 years old and on their fourth album, so long past benefiting from the shock of the new. Those who were aware of their third album, 2009's Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, will remember a synthetic experiment failing to fire the public imagination. It was supposed to pit Britain's nimblest guitar band against proper pop producers Xenomania. But the early sessions failed to yield usable music, a let-down from which the album never recovered. There is a danger that this short, sharp, stylish guitar-pop record may now fail to grab the audience it deserves, thanks to the imminent Arctic Monkeys return and the autumn rush of big American pop. It needs to be shouted out, as though emblazoned on a Soviet-style propaganda poster: this is quintessential Franz, with all the electric guitar and pace and smarts restored. Right Words starts off quoting from a vintage postcard (sender: unknown) that singer Alex Kapranos bought, whose tantalising message \u2013 \"Come home, practically all is nearly forgiven\" \u2013 was addressed to the film director Karel Reisz, responsible for the film Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. There is no pop ground more trodden than that where love goes awol. Franz Ferdinand manage to give heartache two new spins. On The Universe Expanded, whose intro features backwards guitar, time moves in reverse, rewinding a doomed relationship (\"Take the dog back to the RSPCA\") to a state of happiness. Bullet, meanwhile, is a pell-mell, early-80s romp about getting out of one's head in order to get someone out of one's head. Nothing slacks here, not even the songs that step off the gas for a moment to offer up heavenly vocal harmonies or an unexpected Beatley turn. Those arrows on the album's cover aren't coincidental. Ever since the sniper took aim in the lyrics of Take Me Out, this Scottish band have been fixated on the most taut vector between two points, with never laying down fat. Accordingly, the production \u2013 collaborations with bits of Hot Chip, Bj\u00f6rn Yttling and Todd Terje \u2013 is clean and sharp. It's only later that you realise Franz Ferdinand's fourth isn't just a return to form but a tuneful meditation on death, decay and the void. The first inkling of these hidden depths is Evil Eye, a mock-horror tune in which Kapranos sings: \"Don't believe in God/ Don't believe in this shit, not me.\" It's even catchier than the two singles. Soon he's contemplating ripe strawberries and the inevitability of rot. \"Wouldn't it be easy to believe? I believe there's nothing to believe,\" offers the former theology student. The last song groovily imagines a funeral where a few home truths about the deceased are aired. \"Don't play pop music, no/ You know I hate pop music,\" Kapranos sings, wickedly. It ends \u2013 existentially and factually \u2013 on the line \"this really is the end\". Precision touches like these are not to be taken for granted in pop \u2013 and neither are a band like Franz Ferdinand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
