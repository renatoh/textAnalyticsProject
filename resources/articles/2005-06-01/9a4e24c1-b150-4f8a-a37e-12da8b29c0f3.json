Former Channel 4 commissioning editor Farrukh Dhondy has made a feature film called Red Mercury, about three Islamic boys who try to build an atomic bomb, and screened it for prospective buyers in Cannes. Two weeks ago, however, Farrukh was visited by Special Branch's anti-terrorism unit, who quizzed him about the script and demanded how he knew about red mercury. Did he read the News of the World? Certainly not, he replied, but he did have a physics degree from Cambridge and access to the internet. (They always appreciate a clever one.) Did he know there were two cases pending concerning people trying to build atomic bombs? They're nothing to do with me, an aghast Farrukh answered. We want to make sure of that, came the menacingreply. Well, it's this sort of police work that makes one sleep easier, and we trust plod won't rest till every film-maker has been hunted down. \u00b7 Surveillance: Geoff Hoon, at Crystal Palace on Monday night, attending the concert by macrobiotic rockers Coldplay. Were the confluence of these two drippy adornments to British life not cringeworthy enough, the leader of the house was clad in a mustard suit, and could be seen tapping his foot in the VIP area while mouthing along to the words \"and it was all yellow ... \" Geoff, Geoff, Geoff. Need you flaunt your Churchill act quite so publicly? \u00b7 And so to last Thursday's White Tie and Tiaras Ball, Elton John's annual carnival of A-list smugness (footage of the event is even now being edited into an al-Qaida recruiting video), and a confusing decision by Sir Bob Geldof. According to fellow guests, the resolutely self-effacing Bob turned up wearing not simply his honorary knighthood gong around his neck, but a bewildering variety of other medals across his noble breast. Was he attempting to make some kind of ironic point, we ask Jo Phillips in his office, coming dressed as an African dictator? \"I don't think so,\" she muses. \"He has had so many honours bestowed on him ... but it was probably just to cover up a stain on his jacket.\" Naturally, naturally. A stain which, we imagine, would itself symbolise the notion of Africa as a stain on the world's conscience. It's meta-charity! \u00b7 Speaking of the business of celebrity carers, we must congratulate one of Bob's fellow Ks, Olympic rower Matthew Pinsent. Last week, Matthew launched a new government scheme entitled Give a Billion Minutes, which aims to get people to pledge that amount of volunteer time by the end of the year. Very much entering into the spirit of things, Matthew requested, and received, a \u00a310,000 fee for the 120 minutes he dedicated to the effort. Lovely work. \u00b7 Maddeningly, attempts to coax Philip Gould to expand upon his comment on the Blair-Brown relationship have been fruitless, as the PM's focus group guru shies from taking our calls. \"I see Gordon Brown as a mountain,\" he told guests at a Chatham House rules lunch last Friday, \"and Tony Blair as a mountain stream.\" Now what in the name of The Project is he on about? Each time we attempt to fathom it, we picture a babbling Mr T splashing down Gordon's north face, and the image is neither seemly nor appealing. Diary readers are therefore invited to interpret Lord Gould's pronouncement, with the best suggestion winning a bottle of champagne. \u00b7 Finally, we assume he was joking, but Philip also dispensed his thoughts on the Tory leadership race at this same event. \"Tim Yeo,\" he said. \"He's the man. Tim Yeo and William Hague: they're the dream ticket.\" As we say, he does enjoy a giggle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
