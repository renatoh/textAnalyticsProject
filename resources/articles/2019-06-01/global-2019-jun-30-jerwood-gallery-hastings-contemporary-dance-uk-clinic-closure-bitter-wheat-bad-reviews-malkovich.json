For the past decade, the new battle of Hastings has been fought at the south coast resort over an art gallery. Next weekend, the Hastings Contemporary opens after an acrimonious tussle with the owners of the building, the Jerwood Foundation. Back in the late 2000s many Hastings folk tried to stop a gallery being built on the seafront, as local gas guzzlers wanted to keep the area as a car park. But culture won out, and the Jerwood Gallery, funded by the foundation, opened in 2012. Over the next few years its fortunes were mixed - with displays of its 300-plus British collection, including works by Hepworth and Lowry, and exhibitions. But visitor numbers disappointed, partly because of excellent nearby rivals, the De La Warr in Bexhill and Towner in Eastbourne. Mutual bitching finally led to a parting of the ways between foundation and gallery. So, a change of direction and a new name, with Hastings Contemporary now getting Arts Council funding - plus a \u00a3250,000 gift from an anonymous local. The foundation has repossessed its collection, and the gallery will now rely solely on temporary exhibitions. The first of these has works by the Israeli-Danish artist Tal R (sorry, who he?) and Roy Oxlade, better known as the late husband of cult octogenarian painter Rose Wylie. Also on display will be a work by Hastings second-homer Quentin Blake. With loads of hipster Londoners having emigrated to Hastings, and its old town, having long fostered a flourishing arts community, this gallery really ought to succeed. Mind you, the autumn exhibition is on Victor Willing, who was married to Paula Rego. Any more blokes out there who were partners of better-known female artists? About 80% of dancers suffer physical injuries each year - many career-threatening, as top ballerina Lauren Cuthbertson found out in her 20s. So the opening, seven years ago, of a pioneering NHS injury clinic in London for dancers of all types, whether classical ballet or hip-hop, was greeted with applause. But last week came the announcement it is to close in August. All the more disappointing as the clinic, run by the National Institute of Dance Medicine and Science, has also been a hub for research into dance-specific injuries. And, in January, it set up a far-reaching programme into energy issues linked to metabolic rates, bone health and the immune system. Its closure means that many dancers, unless they are with the likes of the Royal Ballet, will have to fork out for private treatment. A real loss. Great dramatist, great actor. So surely a new David Mamet play with John Malkovich (left) would gain plaudits. But Bitter Wheat, which opened 10 days ago at the Garrick, instead received mainly brickbats. Our own Susannah Clapp said it \u201cfails on every front\u201d, while the Stage called it \u201cflabby, cynical and pointless\u201d. Walking past the theatre the other day, I spotted a large poster outside with six five-star reviews under the heading Vox Populi, with tweets such as \u201can absolute must-see\u201d, \u201cfantastic\u201d, and \u201cMalkovich blew me away\u201d. Hmm\u2026 who to trust?"}, "isHosted": false}}}
