She hopes to use it to accomplish something her role model never achieved \u2013 winning a major tournament with England. While Terry swapped Stamford Bridge for Villa Park this summer, the 23-year-old Bright has made the most of her surprise summons to Mark Sampson\u2019s squad by displacing Laura Bassett in defence. Bright\u2019s burgeoning partnership with Manchester City\u2019s Steph Houghton represents one reason why England have conceded only one goal in four games at Euro 2017 and approach Thursday\u2019s semi-final against Holland in Enschede in confident mood. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked up to John Terry, he\u2019s a massive defender and a rock,\u201d Bright said. \u201cHis one-v-one defending and reading of the game have really educated me. I watch a lot of clips of him.\u201d Terry\u2019s example has taught Bright, who is being followed around the Netherlands by a full squad of devoted family members complete with special \u201cMillie\u201d banner, the importance of positioning. \u201cIt\u2019s the basis of Terry\u2019s game,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything else falls into place from positioning.\u201d Instinct also plays a big part. \u201cI try not to overthink things. If you think too much, that\u2019s when the mistakes come in. Keep it basic is what I\u2019ve been doing well \u2013 winning my headers and making sure I win my one-v-one battles. Often your natural instinct tells you whether to hold or go.\u201d Those three clean sheets vindicate Sampson\u2019s faith in her but Bright, left, is particularly proud of preventing France from scoring during England\u2019s 1-0 quarter-final win. \u201cFrance are a top team,\u201d she said. \u201cWe stayed tight as a unit against them and if it meant putting the ball down the channel so be it. We strive to be better each game \u2013 and stopping France from scoring shows how far we\u2019ve come as a back four.\u201d It has given her family \u2013 parents, grandparents, sister, nephews \u2013 cause for celebration at their base in a campsite chalet in the countryside outside Utrecht. \u201cThey\u2019ve been blowing my phone up. They\u2019re really overwhelmed. My mum was so emotional after the France game. This tournament is not just a big experience for me but for them as well. They\u2019ve never been in this sort of environment. It\u2019s just as big a journey for them as it is for me.\u201d As near-perfect tournament debuts go, Bright, and her strong tackling, are pretty much setting the template. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the support the other girls have given me is unreal and I tried to come in with no fear. I\u2019d say I\u2019m a front foot defender; I never hesitate to go in for a challenge. You have to get one over your opponent and dominate them. \u201cMy grandad Arthur always told me: \u2018If you\u2019re going for a ball you go in 100%, never half-hearted.\u2019 He always said: \u2018Millie, if it\u2019s a 50-50 you\u2019re coming out with it.\u2019 Every game I\u2019ve had that mindset. Grandad used to work in the mines and he\u2019s a big part of my career. When a lot of people doubted me he was always the one to pick me up.\u201d Bright \u2013 a talented rider \u2013 was much more interested in horses than football as a child, and family attempts to turn her into a Sheffield Wednesday fan proved an emphatic failure. \u201cThen I started playing football. It became quite difficult to juggle with the horses. I sat down with my mum and dad and decided I had to put my all into one thing. I can go back into the equestrian world when I retire. I had to give football everything now or I\u2019d have missed my opportunity. \u201cYou can go back into equestrianism any time \u2013 we\u2019ve got a yard back home in Sheffield and the horses are still there. They\u2019re just on hold for the moment. I can\u2019t ride and play football; it\u2019s too much of a risk. I\u2019m not sure how impressed England and Chelsea would be if I fell off a horse and got injured. Horses are off limits for me now.\u201d In the Netherlands leisure involves joining family for walks around the canals and alleyways of beautiful Utrecht \u2013 \u201cto clear my mind\u201d \u2013 and watching films (most recently The Little Mermaid) at the team hotel. Such freedom is symptomatic of Sampson\u2019s tenure as the England manager, which has featured a relaxed off-field regime whereby players are permitted to go out on their own and even allowed the odd glass of wine. For the moment, though, Bright and co are concentrating on Holland and especially Vivianne Miedema, their dangerous Arsenal striker. \u201cMiedema\u2019s a big threat,\u201d Bright said. \u201cThe Dutch are very attacking and it\u2019s going to be a very tough, very physical, very high-paced game. Physically they\u2019re very strong and not afraid of a challenge but I like that. I always look forward to a tough game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
