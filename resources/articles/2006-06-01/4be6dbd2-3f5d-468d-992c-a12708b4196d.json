Thus, among the jumping, swimming, pounding and collecting of power-ups and coins - inside that familiar, surreal Mario universe - you also find power-ups that turn Mario into a destructive giant and a tiny figure with a jump like a flea, random flying red blocks and hammer-throwing turtles that yield power-ups, numerous side-levels that you can buy your way into with star coins and rings that expose eight red coins for a short while, which yield a power-up if you collect them. Mario can now wall-jump, swing on ropes and hang from ledges. The touch-screen is barely used but this is classic platform action, as addictive as it was in the 1980s. Steve Boxer Hitman: Blood Money Xbox 360, PC, PS 2, \u00a339.99 Io Interactive/Eidos 3 stars If your idea of good gaming involves sneaking, disguises and a small bit of puzzle-solving, then Hitman comes recommended. Even if you prefer a more gung-ho approach Hitman will appeal, mainly because it is an easier way to finish the game. Hitman involves taking out a series of targets in increasingly fiendish levels. How you achieve these goals is up to you but there is more entertainment by taking a methodical approach. Stealing clothes off a recently garrotted assailant and brazenly walking past guards is more satisfying than gunning them down. However, the challenges of later levels mean the all-action approach can't be disregarded. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence lets the game down, with predictable headless chicken-style behaviour spoiling the atmosphere. A spiteful save-game system and occasional control issues are also frustrating. It's an unpolished diamond, but worthy of investigation. Greg Howson The Movies: Stunts and Effects PC, \u00a319.99 Lionhead/Electronic Arts 3 stars The Movies proved a game of two halves. It was hung on a strategy game that was hard to love even when you got the hang of it. This add-on pack throws in a few extras; new buildings to own and facilities to nurture the stuntmen. There are also new movie lots in the shape of a jungle, a city street and, to go with the special effects studio, a green screen. Unfortunately, the strategy side still has niggles. There are never enough staff even for a successful studio to hire, and the whims of your stars require constant micro-management. But if you have finished the original this will more than do until the inevitable sequel arrives.
