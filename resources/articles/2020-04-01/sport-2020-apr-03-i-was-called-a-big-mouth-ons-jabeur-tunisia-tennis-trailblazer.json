It was the best win of her career and, for the audience, a mixture of proud Tunisians and other Arab nationalities scattered around Doha, it was a rare sight of one of their own thriving in this alien sport. And so they chanted her name before, during and after points, cheering endlessly into the night. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d says Jabeur in a phone interview. \u201cIt was kind of tough sometimes because they didn\u2019t know the rules of tennis! They thought it was a football match, but it was amazing, seeing all the Tunisians who made the effort to come and see me with all the Tunisian flags \u2026 seeing that I had this impact on people following more tennis makes me proud. Not just football, but tennis.\u201d Those scenes \u2013 the sight of a player, a female player, trailblazing in real time \u2013 may turn out to be the most important moment of the tennis season. The Arab world accounts for around 423 million of the world\u2019s population, yet before Jabeur it had yielded only five top-100 players ever. Four were men. The only Arab woman to reach the top level was Jabeur\u2019s compatriot and friend Selima Sfar, who rose to 75 in the world and made the second round of a handful of grand slams during the early 2000s. Over the past few years, Jabeur has made it her mission to change everything. As she has travelled the WTA Tour, she has carried with her one simple phrase: the first. She was the first Arab woman to reach the third round of a slam, the first to break into the top 50 and the first to reach a WTA final. Still, it was not until this year, at 25 years old, that she began to unlock her potential. She has reached the quarter-finals of the two biggest tournaments this season, the Australian Open and Doha. In Melbourne she beat Britain\u2019s Johanna Konta in the first round and then ended Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s career. In Dubai, she held match points before barely losing to Simona Halep in a manic tussle. Her win over Pliskova in Doha was confirmation she is capable of securing top results. She stands 11th in the 2020 rankings and at a career high of 39 overall. Jabeur takes her influence seriously and she is also aware of its unique sphere in tennis. As a Tunisian, she is an Arab woman and African, two of the least represented populations in the sport. While her successes are always reported through an Arab lens, Jabeur has always been clear in her intentions to influence both. \u201cI\u2019m really, really proud of that,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes when we play Fed Cup, some African teams come and they want to take pictures, they ask me about how I\u2019m playing. It\u2019s really inspiring for me. When someone tells me that I\u2019m inspiring them, it gives me more motivation to practice and be more of an example. I hope we can see more players from Africa on the tour.\u201d Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Jabeur\u2019s rise is the fact her formative years were spent at home. Between the coaching, equipment and unavoidable travel, the costs of playing the sport are vast. Without proper tennis infrastructure and high-level competition, even the most talented players face a perilous route to the top. As a child, Jabeur\u2019s biggest move was the 90-mile drive from her coastal hometown, Sousse, to the capital city, Tunis, where she trained in a multi-sport academy from 12 years old. She would later leave for brief stints in Europe, but she quickly learned she was most comfortable at home, where she lives permanently. She proudly calls herself a \u201c100% Tunisian product\u201d. For Jabeur, remaining at home when she was younger meant constantly hearing the laughter and derision of those who would openly tell her that, like most who tried before her, she would never be good enough. \u201cYou find these people everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cThey underestimate you. I was a big mouth, I talked, I said I want to win grand slams, and people were laughing and they didn\u2019t believe in me. Some people did believe in me. \u201cOne time I had a surgery on my wrist and the first few days when I came back after five months, I couldn\u2019t play tennis. The balls were flying everywhere, no feelings or nothing. People were watching, making fun of me and saying: \u2018Yeah, she\u2019s gotta stop tennis.\u2019 But these thoughts make me stronger.\u201d Jabeur was excellent from a young age. In 2011 she became the first Arab woman to win the Roland Garros juniors. It only takes a glimpse of her in action to be blinded by her talent. In an era filled with innumerable flat-hitting baseliners, Jabeur is unique. Her toolbox contains every shot and she is desperate to use them all with style. That can sometimes be a problem. \u201cI just started doing these crazy shots from a young age,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose to play flat or spin. I was just doing crazy shots, which maybe reflects my personality. I like fun, crazy things, I like original stuff. I have so many shots that sometimes it\u2019s tough to choose the right one since I can do everything. Putting [my game] in order helped me to develop.\u201d Jabeur\u2019s perspective on her game also reflects why she has been able to succeed from such unlikely circumstances. Her strokes are handsome and technically sound, and on the surface they look as if they are the work of a good coach who taught her the correct basics. Her response betrays the single-minded conviction that continues to guide her on a path nobody has trodden before. \u201cI don\u2019t remember someone telling me I should do that,\u201d she says. \u201cI always do whatever suits me. Sometimes a coach would tell me I do too many drop shots. I\u2019d say: \u2018Yeah, sure!\u2019 But I never listen. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m forcing my personality because I\u2019m the one playing on the court, I\u2019m the one doing the shots.\u201d For now, her career is out of her hands. One day before tennis officially closed until June, Tunisia cancelled all flights and it left her stranded in Miami. She says she had no idea what to do, so went to New York, now one of the worst-hit cities, to stay with a friend. Even before the culling of Wimbledon, Jabeur did not expect to resume anytime soon in a global sport where players travel weekly from Europe, Asia, the Americas, Oceania and, thanks almost entirely to her on the WTA, Africa. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute,\u201d she says, chuckling. \u201cI know I have the level to be top 20, I just didn\u2019t see coronavirus coming.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
