Injuries have disrupted the former England playmaker\u2019s season and, with Sean Longstaff and Isaac Hayden impressing at the heart of Ben\u00edtez\u2019s team, Shelvey has not even made the substitutes\u2019 bench in recent weeks. When Newcastle\u2019s manager told him he was behind Ki Sung-yueng and Mo Diam\u00e9 in the queue challenging Longstaff and Hayden and would not be part of the squad preparing for Saturday\u2019s trip to West Ham, Shelvey responded by asking to join Ben Dawson\u2019s squad and turn out for the juniors at Fulham as an over-age player on Friday night. \u201cI told Jonjo: \u2018You won\u2019t be involved at West Ham\u2019 when we were training and he asked to play for the Under-23s to improve his match fitness,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cI think it was a very positive movement. Jonjo wants to play to ensure he can get that change of pace, the contact and all the things you get during matches.\u201d This time last year Newcastle\u2019s manager was pushing the 27-year-old\u2019s case for inclusion in Gareth Southgate\u2019s World Cup squad but the landscape has changed. \u201cYou have Longstaff and Hayden doing well now,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cAnd still you have Ki and Diam\u00e9 ahead of Jonjo and they aren\u2019t in the team so you have five midfielders for two positions. Someone has to stay out of the squad; deciding is my problem. \u201cKi has the quality, Diam\u00e9 has the physicality, so for Jonjo to go ahead of them, he has to do really well.\u201d Shelvey has a reputation for being difficult, disruptive even, if things do not go his way but Ben\u00edtez is at pains to emphasise he is proving highly professional during this spell on the sidelines. \u201cNo, he will not cause problems,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cJonjo asked to play for the Under-23s and it\u2019s very positive. He loves football and is keen to be there. If he\u2019s fit, he can compete against anyone \u2013 he has no problem with that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
