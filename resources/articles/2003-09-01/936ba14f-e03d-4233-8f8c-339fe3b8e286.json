He's brilliant and intelligent - and a lovely bloke. Raul, Real Madrid captain I wouldn't want to change places with him. The attention is so great that he can't even leave the house. I think it's too much, but he is an excellent footballer. Vicente, Valencia midfielder Beckham may not quite be up to Zidane, one of the greatest ever, but he's an exceptional player, who brings something some stars maybe lack - real work-rate, an exceptional attitude and endeavour. Javier Gudino, Castilla La Mancha TV It's very difficult for Beckham to play in the centre. I think he's very limited there.
