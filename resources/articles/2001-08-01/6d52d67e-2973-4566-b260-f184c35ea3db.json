The 24-year-old Great Britain stand-off will become the most expensive player in the history of Welsh rugby with the Rhinos receiving \u00a3800,000 from the Welsh Rugby Union while Harris, who will sign a four-year contract, will pick up an annual salary of \u00a3200,000. The WRU will stagger its payments to Leeds over four years and it will pay half of Harris's salary. The deal was due to be concluded earlier this week, but Harris had to provide documentary proof that he was qualified to play for Wales: his father, Paul, and grandfather, Norman, were born in Gwent and the WRU was shown birth certificates. The Wales coach Graham Henry hopes to quickly recoup some of his employers' outlay when Harris, who will move to Wales after the end of the Super League season in October, makes his expected international debut against Tonga at the Millennium stadium in November with the WRU anticipating double the previously expected gate of 25,000. The move is not without its detractors in Wales. \"I think it is divisive,\" said the Newport owner Tony Brown. \"Cardiff and Swansea defected from the WRU three years ago and they are being rewarded for that. Keiron Cunningham may have turned the WRU down at the 11th hour, but I would like to know why other clubs were not asked if they were interested in these players....A lot better use could have been made of this money.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
