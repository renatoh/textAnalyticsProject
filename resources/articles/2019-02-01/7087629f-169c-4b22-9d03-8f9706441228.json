Compiled by Observer critics Mark Kermode, Simran Hans, Wendy Ide, Guy Lodge and Jonathan Romney, and edited down to the final 25 by me, the list ran in chronological order from 1922 (Nosferatu) to 2017 (On Body and Soul), taking in masterpieces from France, Italy, Poland, Romania, Greece and the UK along the way. This wasn\u2019t, as Kermode stated in his intro, \u201can attempt to create a critical canon that singles out the finest achievements in Euro-cinema\u201d. Rather, it was a personal selection of films that we hoped would \u201cgive a flavour of the dazzling breadth of European cinema, offering a tiny snapshot of a vast cinematic landscape\u201d. To say this prompted a lively discussion in the comments section would be an understatement, as our cinephile readers rushed in to praise the list and take it to task. Omissions were decried (\u201cWhat, no [Krzysztof] Kie\u015blowski?\u201d) and alternative suggestions provided, triggering a cascade of wonderful recommendations that carried us far beyond the initial 25. We were delighted, too, by the spirited debate it provoked about what constitutes a great European film and what these works tell us about the society we live in. Here are some of the comments that stood out for us. It\u2019s refreshing to see a list that reflects unashamedly thoughtful, personal choices without banging any particular drum. Nice, too, to see some of the more obvious choices swerved \u2013 Jean-Luc Godard especially. Everyone will want to add their contribution \u2013 mine would be Kie\u015blowski, whose later work represents the most sustained meditation on the idea of Europe in all of cinema. Agnes Varda, too, seems worth a shout. That said, good to see Agnieszka Holland getting a mention; she\u2019s been unjustly neglected for decades. Jericho1 The film missing from this very good list is Passport to Pimlico \u2026 It looks deep into the history of Europe, asking questions about what we used to be, who we are now, and what we are to become. As a bonus, Passport now reads as an excellent Brexit metaphor. The working classes, struggling under austerity, are tricked by a charlatan into pursuing a ridiculous independence campaign. I challenge anyone to name another film of the era that has so much to say about Europe today. blearyboy Pretty good list. My own personal additions: The Rules of the Game; A Man Escaped; Rififi; Ascension to the Scaffold; L\u2019Eclisse; 400 Blows; Pierrot le Fou; Belle de Jour; The Servant; The Entertainer; The Offence; The Conformist; Suspiria; Christiane F; Diva; Red; Les Visiteurs; Man Bites Dog; La Haine; Underground; Leviathan; The Great Beauty; Suburra. dondi Very good list with some interesting inclusions (Daisies instead of Knife in the Water). It\u2019s hard to distill European cinema in only 25 films. I\u2019d say that The Double Life of Veronique is essential and so is the Three Colours Trilogy, all made by the late, great Kieslowski. And Stalker instead of Andrei Rublev? That is a surprise. It\u2019s one of the best movies ever made. SashaMe Someone pointed out that there\u2019s a major gap between 1981-1999. Some suggestions: La Haine, Dekalog, Baby of M\u00e2con, My Life as a Dog, The Match Factory Girl, Naked, Satantango Mikko _ Fabulous list (thank you for l\u2019Atalante), but no Great Expectations or Bridge over the River Kwai? [And] has [Bernardo] Bertolucci so outraged sensible opinion that Il Conformista gets the thumbs down? SimonLegg Shame [Andrzej Wajda\u2019s 1958] film Ashes and Diamonds wasn\u2019t included. This portrayal of the largely unspoken psychological trauma of Poland\u2019s re-occupation by Russia and imposition of communism post war gave me goosebumps \u2026 even with subtitles. madapples An idiosyncratic selection, which includes some films that many (like me) will never have heard of, and all the more interesting for that. Some room could perhaps have been made for [Pier Paolo] Pasolini\u2019s Theorum, Bertolucci\u2019s The Conformist, [Michael] Haneke\u2019s Piano Teacher, [Lars] von Trier\u2019s Melancholia \u2026 but really the field is too large to do more than point at the more obvious omissions. Mrdaydream What joy to read praise for Ermanno Olmi. He was truly great, and some of his later films (One Hundred Nails among others) were also very good, although The Tree of Wooden Clogs is certainly the best. theunlikelyviking In these days of tribalism and isolationism it\u2019s nice to be reminded about why European culture is just so fucking cool. GonePhishing Not a single Carry On film, not one! Is this an example of what Brexiteers mean by out of touch elitism? Popsider1975 As ever, there\u2019s a raised eyebrow or two over things not there, but mainly a kick in the pants for me to watch one or two of these that have passed me by. avidavid The Passion of Joan of Arc and Peeping Tom are two of my favourite films, I think Joan is easily the best silent film ever made, Falconetti\u2019s face is transcendental, I\u2019ve never seen another like it, the best piece of acting on film, it leaves me a mess every time. Colin Christian What does it say of a civilisation whose \u201cbest\u201d filmography consists in reflections of alienation, loneliness and decadence? Falanx No Satantango \u2013 Doesn\u2019t get more European than 7 hours shot in black and white, set in a post-communist Hungarian village. cache2 I can\u2019t be bothered with Hollywood trash so it\u2019s great to see a list of Euro films, all except Nosferatu I haven\u2019t seen yet.
