The World Bank has been accused of undermining human rights and has faced criticism from local and international civil society groups over the Tanzania secondary education quality improvement programme loan. Campaigners say approval should not have been given without first securing a commitment from the government to reverse its discrimination towards pregnant girls and end compulsory pregnancy tests. A public notice released earlier this week by Tanzania\u2019s education minister, JoyceNdalichako, said: \u201cThe target [of the loan] is to reach more than 6.5 million secondary school students across the country, without discrimination and shall include girls who drop out of school for various reasons, including pregnancy. \u201cThe government is committed to ensure that they continue with their education as prescribed in the project.\u201d Of the 60,000 students who drop out of secondary school every year in Tanzania, 5,500 leave due to pregnancy according to World Bank data. Tanzania\u2019s ban on pregnant schoolgirls dates back to the 60s. Amid renewed criticism, it was reaffirmed in a 2017 speech by Tanzania\u2019s president, John Magufuli, who stated that \u201cas long as I am president \u2026 no pregnant student will be allowed to return to school. We cannot allow this immoral behaviour to permeate our primary and secondary schools.\u201d Sierra Leone lifted a similar ban last week. Human rights lawyer Judy Gitau, regional coordinator at Equality Now, welcomed Ndalichako\u2019s declaration and said she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about \u201cthe first time the government of Tanzania has publicly announced in an official state document that it will include pregnant girls in secondary school education\u201d But El\u00edn Martinez, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the Tanzanian government\u2019s positionremained unchanged. She referred to a recent tweet in Swahili from Tanzania\u2019s chief government spokesperson that indicated the government has set up parallel systems for pregnant girls. \u201cTanzania will continue to arbitrarily deny pregnant girls the right to study in formal public primary and secondary schools \u2013 and they will only have an option of studying in a parallel system, which will now be built using the World Bank\u2019s loan,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, adding that the \u201calternative education pathways\u201d only offer a condensed version of the curriculum, and at a cost. The World Bank has \u201cundermined its own commitment to non-discrimination and to improving the lives of \u2018marginalised groups,\u2019\u201d she said. Gitau condemmed the parallel system and called for the \u201creintegration of all pregnant girls to mainstream education\u201d. In a factsheet about the programme released last week, the World Bank said the Tanzanian government \u201chas reaffirmed that pregnant girls who enrol in AEP [alternative education pathways] can sit for national secondary school examinations. Once they pass, they will be eligible to enrol in the next cycle of the public school system, similar to children who undertook their education in public or private schools.\u201d It also stated that the government has \u201cagreed to assess the prevalence of pregnancy testing and develop an approach to address this practice\u201d and that the World Bank will \u201cadvocate a halt to all involuntary pregnancy testing in schools in Tanzania\u201d. The World Bank and the Tanzanian ministry of education were unavailable for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
