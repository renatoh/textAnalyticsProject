The soldiers, from the Queen's Royal Lancers, were on a routine patrol in the Maysan province yesterday when they were caught in an explosion, the Ministry of Defence said. Three soldiers were also injured, one very seriously, and have been flown to Tallil airbase in Dhi Qar province. The MoD said the soldiers were killed by an improvised explosive device in south-east Iraq at around 11.20 local time yesterday. \"It is with great sadness that the Ministry of Defence must confirm the deaths of two soldiers from the Queen's Royal Lancers. The soldiers were on a routine patrol in a Scimitar armoured vehicle when they were hit by the blast. Three further soldiers were injured, one of them very seriously. All casualties were taken by helicopter to Tallil airbase in Dhi Qar province,\" the MoD said. The deaths come a day after Iraqi authorities took control of security in Maysan, described by the defence secretary, Des Browne, as a \"milestone\" - and after the capital, Baghdad, endured one of its bloodiest days with up to 200 Iraqis killed in insurgent attacks. British forces withdrew from their permanent base in Maysan last August but have continued to work at improving border security in the province. The MoD has stressed that the transfer would not result in UK troop reductions as no British forces are permanently based there. The Queen's Royal Lancers, based in Catterick, North Yorkshire, are approaching the end of a six-month tour of Iraq."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
