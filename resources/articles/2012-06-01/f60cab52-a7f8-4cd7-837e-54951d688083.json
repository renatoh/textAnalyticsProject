The tone is a little lighter this time, though, as we follow a violent young offender's potentially fruitful encounter with the whisky industry, thus bringing together the best and worst of Scotland. Prometheus (15) (Ridley Scott, 2012, US) Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron. 124 mins With all the zealous promotion and yet tight secrecy, this long-awaited Alien prequel couldn't live up to fans' expectations, could it? There's no way of telling at the time of writing, so let's just say it'll be a brilliant triumph, and a complete disaster. The Turin Horse (15) (B\u00e9la Tarr, 2011, Hun/Fra/Ger/Swi/US) J\u00e1nos Derszi, Erika B\u00f3k, Mih\u00e1ly Kormos. 155 mins The master of slowness fashions another slow masterpiece \u2013 apparently his last. The faithful will be appeased by Tarr's stately, textured compositions and real-time observation of grinding rural toil. Inspired by a story about Nietzsche, it's perfectly bleak. Snow White &amp; The Huntsman (12A) (Rupert Sanders, 2012, US) Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth. 127 mins After Mirror Mirror, another unnecessary \"upgrade\" of the fairytale, this time as a Lord Of The Rings-style epic, with cameo dwarves (Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, etc), and Theron as the bitchiest of them all. Disney it ain't, but nor is it Twilight, at least. Himizu (18) (Shion Sono, 2011, Jap) Sh\u00f4ta Sometani, Fumi Nikaid\u00f4, Tetsu Watanabe. 130 mins A manga-derived teen saga of crime, violence and romance made more intense by the post-tsunami setting. On The Sly (PG) (Olivier Ringer, 2011, Bel/Fra) Wynona Ringer. 77 mins Ignored by her parents, a little girl runs off to the forest in this child's-eye adventure. It treads a nice line between fairytale and social drama. LOL (12A) (Lisa Azuelos, 2012, US) Miley Cyrus, Douglas Booth, Demi Moore. 97 mins You'd have to be David Cameron to find anything fresh in this generic teen tripe with social networking references shoehorned in. Top Cat (U) (Alberto Mar, 2011, Mex/Arg/UK) Jason Harris, Bill Lobley, Chris Edgerly. 90 mins Making Alvin and the Chipmunks look positively A-list, a cheap Mexican-made attempt to update the street-smart kitty. Death Watch (12A) (Bertrand Tavernier, 1980, Fra/W Ger/UK) Harvey Keitel, Romy Schneider, Harry Dean Stanton. 130 mins Decades ahead of its time, this cult media critique sees Keitel getting a camera implanted in his eye to stalk Schneider for a reality TV show \u2013 in Glasgow. Rowdy Rathore (15) (Prabhu Deva, 2012, Ind) Akshay Kumar, Sonakshi Sinha, Nasser. 143 mins Outlaw Kumar is confronted with fatherhood issues in this action-heavy comedy. Out from Friday Casa De Mi Padre Will Ferrell leads a comical Mexican western. Ill Manors Plan B diagnoses Broken Britain with a London gang thriller. Out from Wed A Fantastic Fear Of Everything Simon Pegg plays a paranoid writer facing his deepest fears. Woody Allen: A Documentary Observations from Allen and his peers. The Innkeepers Hard-up owners exploit their motel's haunted past, and regret it. The Pact Supernatural scares when a woman revisits her childhood home. Sing Your Song Biodoc on singer Harry Belafonte. The Harsh Light Of Day British horror thriller. Arirang Introspective Korean documentary.
