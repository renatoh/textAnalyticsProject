What happened: If Metallica thought they were bringing the gargling heaviosity and demonic nightmare tunes to Glastonbury 2014, they\u2019ve a whole lot still to learn from Pixies. Boston\u2019s iconic pioneers of biblical and sci-fi screamelodica add precision, mania, panache and pop accessibility to such metallic arts and, in a casually furious hour, crush Hetfield\u2019s lot like the grunting try-hards they are. Frank \u201cREEE-PENT!\u201d Black and his dark marshals \u2013 new bassist Paz Lenchantin bringing a dash of colour with her fret-end corsage \u2013 enthral the imagination because their grotesque anti-fantasies are steeped in magical realism, from the Samson myth of Gouge Away to the Dali-esque sliced eyeballs of Debaser and the underwater highway cruise to the bottom of the Mariana Trench that is Wave of Mutilation. And even when tackling more earthly matters they\u2019re deliciously deviant: Hey is the most heavenly brothel lament imaginable and U-Mass a horny student keg party surfing into hell. High point: Joey Santiago's raw guitar solo, and strumming of one guitar with the neck of another during Vamos; a celebration of feedback and evil noise. Low point: None. Even the tracks from new album Indie Cindy \u2013 Bagboy and Greens And Blues \u2013 settle smoothly into the set. In a tweet: Gods and monsters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
