The money is being directed through StreetGames, a project launched in 2007 with the aim of using expert coaches and local volunteers to bring free sport schemes to deprived areas. The new scheme will see it working more closely with sports' national governing bodies. The first year will focus on athletics, rowing, table tennis, handball, gymnastics and badminton. The government hopes the plans will help Sport England towards its target of getting a million more people playing more sport by 2012."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
