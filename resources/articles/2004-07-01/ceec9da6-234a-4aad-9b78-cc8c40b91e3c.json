European trade ministers fly to Brussels tomorrow knowing that world trade talks could implode if the 25-member European Union fails to agree its own negotiating position. France has lost faith in the EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy's negotiations and wants to force a vote in order to frame a new mandate for him. This could split Europe and also delay any progress on a wider international agreement for nine months. WTO talks beginning in Geneva on Tuesday will be the last chance to make meaningful progress on a global deal until after the US elections. France is furious that under the current draft framework published 10 days ago, it would be forced to open up its beef, dairy and cereals markets to imports. British trade minister Mike O'Brien is set to fly to Brussels tomorrow and is expected to put pressure on France to accept the deal as it stands. A Whitehall source said: 'France is causing flutters. They're focusing on the legality of the commission's position. Everyone's rushing to their lawyers. This could be France's \"Iraq\" moment when it just says: \"Non! We've had enough\".' France, the main beneficiary of the EU's \u20ac40 billion farm budget, and others such as Ireland are most worried about an EU offer to scrap agricultural export subsidies and open its domestic farm markets to imports. Lamy and his negotiators are still pushing to get the US to match the EU's offer on export subsidies by imposing greater disciplines on its own export subsidies. Developing countries, however, are frustrated that any concessions they receive are ambiguous and could be further watered down. But French demands are also causing worries among other member states. The Swedish foreign ministry said in a briefing note to its parliament ahead of the Monday meeting that while it favoured making demands on Washington, it did not want agreement to founder on market access. WTO talks have been run ning for three years and have made little progress. Last September developing countries rejected Europe's attempt to force new investment and procurement rules on an agenda that was supposed to help poor countries out of poverty. UN figures show that developing countries lose $65bn a year due to northern countries' protection in textiles and agriculture. In 2001, Mali received $38m in US aid but lost $43m in cotton export earning due to US subsidies of its own cotton industry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
