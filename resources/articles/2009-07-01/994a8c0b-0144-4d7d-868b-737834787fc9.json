Some cricket, you may have noticed, has come to Cardiff, and the station is making the most of it. Yesterday, Good Morning Wales, presented by the likable duo of Rhun ap Iorwerth and Sarah Dickins, used cheery cricket coverage to punctuate harder stories. The travel, weather and sports news, too, chimed in with their own jaunty references to the Ashes contest down the road. There was relief all round that things had gone well. \"Not everyone was on our side,\" the Chairman of Glamorgan Cricket Club told Iorwerth. \"But we deserve this; it was not an aberration.\" He had instructed his staff, he added, to cosset visitors: \"I told them to treat every request as if it was the most important thing they'd ever been asked.\" The only critical notes concerned the ground itself. \"This is not a pretty ground,\" said Jonathan Agnew, \"it never will be.\" Mike Gatting, having praised the event, was less keen on the playing surface. \"The pitch is a typical Cardiff pitch,\" he observed, \"Slow, a bit on the low side, and it's turned a bit already.\" Ordinarily, these might be taken as slights; but yesterday, in the grip of Ashes fever, everyone was just pleased it hadn't rained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
