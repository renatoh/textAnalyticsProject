By offering to take a Newcastle XI to play a pre-season friendly at The Warren, home of Ryman League Yeading - who impressed in their 2-0 defeat by Graeme Souness's side at Loftus Road in the FA Cup third round on Sunday - Shepherd attempted to reinvent himself as a friend of those small clubs he had seemingly derided in the Middle East. In his Dubai speech, Shepherd claimed that most lower- division and leading non-league clubs should turn semi-professional, arguing: \"There's no sympathy. It's dog eat dog and many will have to go part-time.\" But yesterday his stance appeared to have mellowed. \"We really enjoyed getting to know the people at Yeading and we were determined to give something back,\" said Shepherd. \"And what better way is there than to give them a re-match by taking a side down there for a pre-season friendly. \"Yeading gave a fantastic account of themselves on and off the pitch. They were a credit to the game and the FA Cup. This type of Cup-tie is what the game is all about. We are looking forward to seeing them again in the summer.\" Meanwhile, Shepherd has been offered \"one last chance\" to settle the long dispute over Sir Bobby Robson's severance pay by the League Managers' Association. If a settlement cannot be reached the LMA will activate its little-used tribunal of arbitration to rule on the argument between Robson, sacked as Newcastle's manager in August, and Shepherd. \"This is massively frustrating for Bobby, who was wrongfully dismissed, but we are giving Newcastle one last chance to sort it out,\" said the LMA's chief executive John Barnwell yesterday. \"Although everything is in place with the Premier League for the tribunal to be set up and go ahead we are finally making more progress than before; Newcastle now seem more willing to negotiate.\" The process has been slowed by Newcastle's refusal to allow an independent mediator to endeavour to broker a compromise between the opposing lawyers acting in a case in which it is estimated tens of thousands of pounds have already been spent on legal fees. Even if the case now goes to tribunal, Robson's advisers fear resolution could be delayed by up to three months should Newcastle exercise their right to object to the, as yet unknown, chairman. Robson, whose one-year deal was due to run until June this year, is being paid around \u00a3100,000-a-month compensation by Newcastle but he believes he is also entitled to significant bonus payments agreed under that contract. He also wants a one-off sum rather than monthly cheques."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
