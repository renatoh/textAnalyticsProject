The union has told its 18,500 members that it has run up deficits of more than \u00a33.6m in the past four years and has seen its assets fall from more than \u00a37m to \u00a31m because of staff pension costs, legal representation at rail crash inquiries and a \u00a3500,000 legal bill to fight a dispute with its former general secretary. Tony Yates-Watson, finance chief, says in the union's journal: \"The result of all this is that we have had to sell our liquid investments. In 1999 we had over \u00a32.5m held in government stocks and equity investments. We are now down to just over \u00a31m. If the society is to survive, this situation cannot be allowed to continue. If the current deficit trend continues we have 30 months left before we have to consider selling 9 Arkwright Road [the union's headquarters].\" Aslef was once one of the richer unions but is facing financial problems running its pension scheme, which according to its latest accounts shows a deficit of almost \u00a32m. The union represents some of the highest paid working-class workers in the country - express train drivers earn between \u00a335,000 and \u00a340,000 a year rising to \u00a350,000 for Eurostar drivers - and is putting up union subscriptions by almost 20% to stem further losses. Mr Yates-Watson warns that the union must build up its reserves or \"we will not be in a position to fund another Southall inquiry [the rail crash investigation] or cushion the effect on members of an industrial dispute\". Part of the union's financial problems stem from the time it became embroiled in a long dispute with its former general secretary Shaun Brady, who was sacked. He took Aslef to a tribunal which said the union broke its rules when it sacked him. An inquiry into the union's affairs followed, costing \u00a3260,000. A spokesman said yesterday: \"We are hoping that the increased subscription rates should go a long way to balance the books.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
