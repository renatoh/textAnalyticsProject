More than 80% of Unite cabin crew members backed strike action when balloted last month, on a turnout of 79%. Footage on YouTube from the results of a previous ballot, which would have seen a 12-day walkout last Christmas, showed delirious celebrations among staff. But any impression of solidarity belies a more complex web of factions within Unite. The union's largest BA staff group is the British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (Bassa). It is the Unite cabin crew branch which has the overwhelming majority of BA strikers in its ranks, with 10,500 members. It was affiliated to the Transport and General Workers' Union (T&amp;G), which merged with the Amicus union in 2007 to form Unite. It is the branch of airline stewards from the Amicus side of the merger \u2013 Cabin Crew 89 \u2013 that forms the second, smaller faction, described as Bassa's rival. Formed in 1989, Cabin Crew 89 has around 1,000 BA cabin crew members, many based at Gatwick rather than Heathrow. Historically, Cabin Crew 89 have considered themselves as moderates, while Bassa officials have treated their counterparts with scepticism. Keen to highlight divisions, BA officials have pointed out that the animosity between the two cabin crew unions saw their officials refuse to sit in the same room during talks last year. That spat, rooted in a personality clash between certain figures, was indeed serious but was resolved by the end of last year. During the latest rounds of negotiations and lobbying, however, key members from both factions have been working closely together. However, tensions exist between the cabin crew branches and the Unite leadership. These stem from a pay dispute in 2007 when, just as cabin crew were on the verge of industrial action, the then T&amp;G general secretary, Tony Woodley, secured a deal with BA. This has led to suspicions that Woodley and his co-general secretary, would do an unacceptable deal with BA. Today's events appear to have discounted those fears, but there will have to be a deal between Unite and BA at some point as old tensions could resurface. The strikebreakers Perhaps the most controversial of the parties that will be seeking to help BA break this weekend's strike is the secretive organisation known as the Professional Cabin Crew Council (PCCC). Set-up as an alternative to the cabin crew Unite groups, the PCCC has an impressive website, is staunchly opposed to the strike and, while claiming to be composed of bona fide cabin crew members, is regarded by some as nothing more than a front for BA. Unite reacted angrily earlier this year when the body emailed all BA staff urging them to vote no in the strike ballot, accusing the airline of seeking to create a \"breakaway union\". Yesterday the PCCC's website contained warnings about the laws surrounding picket lines and encouraging all staff to work during the strike. \"We need to salvage this disastrous situation by collaborating, listening and negotiating with BA,\" it said. Less staunch, but also the recipient of Unite criticism, is Balpa, the Pilots' and Flight Engineers' trade union. It infuriated cabin crew members in January after declaring it was \"neutral\" over the decision by BA to start rushing its members through three-week training courses so they could take over flight attendant duties as possible strikebreakers. Tony Woodley, the joint general secretary at Unite, accused Balpa of violating trade union principles and said pilots were usinged their privileged position \"to undermine much lower-paid trade union colleagues\". The other player keen to break the strike is the chief executive of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary said he would provide BA with three spareaircraft and flight attendants in a gesture designed to minimise passenger disruption. \"BA is in a fight for survival and the last thing they need is strike action from a greedy union which passengers simply won't tolerate,\" Ryanair said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
