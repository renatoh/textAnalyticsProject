Andrew Broad\u2019s old seat was eventually won by the Nationals candidate and sociologist, Anne Webster, but not before the party lost 28% of their primary vote to a Melbourne Cup field of 13 candidates. Webster won 66-34 on a two-party preferred basis, though that result belied the complex nature of the count. While Webster won 28% of the primary vote, Liberal candidate Serge Petrovich picked up 19%. Three independents Jason Modica (9%), Ray Kingston (9%) and Cecilia Moar (3%) won a total of 21% of the primaries, also putting a significant dent in the Coalition\u2019s vote. Broad first contested the seat in 2013 which is the last time the Liberals were allowed to run under the three-cornered contest rules. Then, candidate Chris Crewther picked up 27% of the primaries while Broad won 38%. So overall, the 2019 Coalition vote dropped on the last three-cornered contest though at that time, the tide was coming in for the Abbott election compared with the uphill battle and the Broad saga this time around. Webster puts the swing down to a large field, including a Liberal candidate and the hangover from the Broad scandal, which was raised by both voters and National party grass roots members. \u201cThere was disappointment in the National party itself, and questions about how we get over it among ordinary grass roots members early on,\u201d Webster said. \u201cThere was a history, that I was seeking to put behind us. The result also showed that people didn\u2019t want [Bill] Shorten and did want [Scott] Morrison, so we put a percentage down to that.\u201d There are two points to make about Mallee. Firstly, when offered choice, rural voters can shift, notwithstanding the result in New England that handed Barnaby Joyce a slight swing on 2016. \u201cThe idea that votes blindly go to Nats is wrong,\u201d says Kingston, a climate-concerned farmer from Yarriambiack. \u201cThe story is if there are credible alternatives that vaguely fit your world view, people will change. The electorate is not cohesive at all. It\u2019s all over the shop.\u201d The second point goes to the heart of the Coalition arrangements around three-cornered contests. Is the Coalition ban disenfranchising voters by not offering choice in every election? Serge Petrovich, the Liberals candidate for Mallee, says the National party has treated country seats as a \u201cbirthright\u201d. He has called for the Coalition agreement on three-cornered contests to be reviewed because he believes voters are being disenfranchised. Petrovich is a former policeman, a barrister, a former member of the party\u2019s administrative committee and a member the Liberal party for nearly 30 years. He was asked to run in Mallee after Andrew Broad retired in the wake of the sugar baby scandal. \u201cWe are definitely disenfranchising people,\u201d Petrovich said. \u201cAs a member of administrative committee, I did wonder whether the staunch Coalition rule that prevents three-cornered contests serves either of us well. \u201cI have [questioned the agreement] and others have, not necessarily to end the Coalition agreement or three-cornered rules, it\u2019s more about thinking carefully about the agreement.\u201d He said his interest stemmed from growing up in country Victoria near Bendigo even though he is no longer local. Petrovich believes that by banning either Coalition party from running against sitting members, local party infrastructure is denuded and members drift away, which means when there is an opportunity to stand, there are no longer the party volunteers to do so. \u201c[The Nationals] are very parochial about country seats, they see them as their birthright,\u201d he said. He suggested results showed Liberal voters return preferences to the Nationals but Nationals voters do not return the favour, often supporting other candidates over the Liberals to ensure seats are not locked up by the Liberals. \u201cThey spend a lot of time telling people they are not Libs,\u201d Petrovich said. \u201cIf the Libs go out, 80% of the Liberals\u2019 vote goes to the Nats, but the proportion of Nats vote to Liberals is only 30-40%.\u201d He said the Nationals were \u201cdirty as hell\u201d when the former Liberal MP Sharman Stone took the seat of Murray (renamed Nicholls at the last election) from the Nationals and then held it for 20 years before retiring in 2016. (It then went to the Nationals\u2019 Damian Drum.) \u201cWhen Sharman took that Nationals seats of Murray, the Nats members drifted away,\u201d said Petrovich. \u201cThey go to Lions or Probus or Rotary. Branch members are generally good community members, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same with Labor as well.\u201d Petrovich, who does a lot of legal work in the Mildura, watched the election of independent Ali Cupper on her third attempt in the state seat of Mildura. He said if the Liberals had been allowed to run, the Mildura Nationals MP Peter Crisp would have held it with the help of Liberal preferences but the seat fell to independent Ali Cupper, a former Labor candidate. \u201cOften if you\u2019ve got Labor and the Greens, it helps for us to have a running partner,\u201d said Petrovich. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s everyone against the incumbent. It worked in the Nats\u2019 favour in Mallee. Peter Crisp would have won against Ali Cupper.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
