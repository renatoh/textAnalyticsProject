Boil the root in a small, covered saucepan for 30 minutes, or until soft, then drain. When the beetroot is cool enough to handle, rub off the outer skin and put this in a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Cook the skin until it is completely dry, then grind into a powder with a sprinkle of salt, either in a mortar or liquidiser. Add a glug of oil to the hot frying pan, then gently saute the whole beetroot leaves and stalks with a pinch of salt and a dash of balsamic vinegar, if you like. Cut the beetroot in half, and serve topped with the leaves and the beetroot skin powder sprinkled on top. Cauliflower hearts, florets and leaves with black garlic Prep 5 min Cook 20 min Serves 4-6 1 cauliflower with its leaves Sea salt 4 cloves black garlic (optional) Reducing food waste becomes easier when you incorporate every part of an ingredient into the same dish. Cooking in this way often results in the simplest preparation. In this case, a cauliflower is cooked whole, so that the leaves and core can be served with the florets. Put the cauliflower in a large saucepan big enough to house it, then cover with boiling water. Season generously with salt and bring to a boil. Cover, turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Carefully lift the cauliflower from the pan and leave to drain for a minute. Cut into steaks and serve topped with slices of black garlic, if using. Chicken soup with offcuts on toast When cooking with any meat, and especially offal, I recommend using only meat from a well looked-after and very high-quality animal. The good news is, a chicken carcass and offal are very affordable, even when organic. Prep 10 min Cook 2 hr 45 min \u20134 hr Serves 4-6 1 small chicken carcass, cut into four pieces Offal from 1 chicken (ie, heart, gizzard, liver and feet) 2 bay leaves 4 parsley stalks 1 dark-green leek top, cut into 3cm pieces 1 carrot, cut in half lengthways 1 stick celery, cut into 5cm pieces Salt and black pepper 100ml leftover red wine 2 slices wholemeal bread, toasted Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the pieces of chicken carcass on an oven tray and roast for 30 minutes. Once cooked, strain off any fat into a small bowl and put in the fridge for later. Put the roasted carcass in a large pan with the bay leaves, parsley stalks and chicken gizzard and feet, if you have them. Cover with water, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for one hour. Lift the carcass bones out of the stock, leaving the gizzard and feet and, once they are cool enough to handle, pull off all the meat. Put the meat to one side, return the picked bones to the stock and simmer again for one to three hours. Pass the stock through a sieve, and return it to a clean pan. Finely slice the gizzards, cut the feet, if using, in half, and return to the pan with the leek tops, carrots and celery. Simmer for 30 minutes, then season to taste. The soup will now keep in the fridge for up to a week. Fry the liver and heart until just cooked, then season generously and set aside to rest. Meanwhile, add the wine to the hot pan and reduce until thick and glossy. Spread the cold reserved chicken fat on toast, top with the offal, dress with the wine reduction and serve alongside the soup. Braised celery heart with homemade ricotta and celery leaves Prep 5 min Cook 1 hr Serves 2 500ml whole milk near its use-by date (or 150g ricotta) Sea salt, to taste Zest and juice of \u00bd lemon 1 bunch celery, with leaves and base intact Extra-virgin olive oil, to taste To make the ricotta, heat the milk and a generous pinch of salt over a medium heat, until it is almost boiling, then turn off the heat. After five minutes, stir in the lemon zest and juice, then leave for 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the curds out of the whey into a fine sieve lined with a cloth, and leave to sit for 30 minutes or more to strain. Keep the whey \u2013 you\u2019ll use it to braise the celery; it\u2019s also a nutritious drink in its own right. Meanwhile, pull a handful of leaves from the top and inside of the celery and set aside. Cut the bottom 6cm off the bunch and store the stalks in the crisper draw for another use. If the very base is dirty or discoloured, trim it carefully, then cut the heart in two lengthways, revealing its layered, fennel-like centre. Rinse clean, pat dry and season with salt. Heat a frying pan with a dash of olive oil over a medium heat, put the celery heart cut side down in the pan, and leave to cook without moving it for five minutes, until it is caramelised and golden brown. Add 150ml whey from the ricotta (or some water), cover the pan and leave to braise gently for another 15 minutes. Serve the braised celery with the lemon ricotta and celery leaves on the side, and dress with olive oil to taste. \u2022 Tom Hunt is a chef, food writer, sustainability campaigner and founder of Poco Tapas Bar in Bristol.
