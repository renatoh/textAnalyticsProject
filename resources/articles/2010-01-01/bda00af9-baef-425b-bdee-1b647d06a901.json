Eleanor Davies, who runs the Wirral-based independent bookshop Linghams, got in touch with Leahy after reading an interview in which he expressed guilt about forcing small shops out of business. Davies found Leahy's email address and sent him a message saying that Tesco could help her. The Heswall branch of Tesco now has three signs in its books section advising customers that a wider range of titles is available across the road in Linghams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
