With no cover over Metallica\u2019s stage, water pours off the Californian metal veterans\u2019 instruments and singer James Hetfield\u2019s sodden grey hair looks pasted to his head. It makes for quite a spectacle, especially when ominous black clouds on the video screens match those in the skies above. Although the band are presumably well rewarded for enduring a thorough saturation, after 38 years and various lineups they are obviously revelling in what Hetfield calls \u201cthe best job in the world\u201d. The intense, gravel-voiced rocker thanks fans for sticking with them \u201cfor a million years\u201d and instructing them to consider their recent record Hardwired\u2026 to Self-Destruct \u201cyour favourite album of all time \u2013 just for tonight, right?\u201d The black-clad, generation-spanning faithful are rewarded with a two-and-a-half hour metal masterclass, with career landmarks going back to Seek and Destroy from 1983\u2019s thrash metal benchmark Kill \u2019Em All. There are brutally heavy rockers about death and desolation along with gently anthemic songs about, well, death and desolation. \u201cThis one \u2013 surprisingly enough \u2013 is about addiction,\u201d says Hetfield, drily acknowledging another recurring theme. Drug abuse also inspires the classic Master of Puppets, a nine-minute marathon that brings hardcore punk energy to metal \u2013 it features Hetfield demonically cackling and the crowd chanting the jabbing \u201cObey your master!\u201d hookline. There are pyrotechnics, fireworks and even a dip into I Wanna Be Adored by local heroes the Stone Roses. By now, drummer Lars Ulrich is grinning maniacally as showers of water fly upwards each time he hits the snare drum. An eerie fog descends for a hymnal Nothing Else Matters and the rain suddenly stops during the last chorus of an epic, cathartic, stadium-sized singalong Enter Sandman, as if the heavy weather is all part of the show. \u2022 At Twickenham Stadium, London, on 20 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
