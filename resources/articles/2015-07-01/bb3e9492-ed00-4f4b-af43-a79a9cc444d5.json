Rates of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related deaths are far higher in the Northern Territory than nationally, and the 2013 Alcohol Mandatory Treatment Act introduced in response requires that anyone who is picked up by police for being drunk three times in two months be placed under an alcohol mandatory treatment (AMT) order and forced into rehabilitation. The act involves the \u201cdubious\u201d application of medical intervention and is \u201cdisturbing\u201d in the way it only targets problem drinkers in public rather than all problem drinkers, according to the ethics and law article published in the Medical Journal of Australia on Monday. The policy has attracted widespread criticism that it unfairly targets Indigenous people and criminalises alcoholism, as homeless and itinerant people \u2013 most of whom are Indigenous in the territory \u2013 are much more likely to be picked up. Dr Fiona Lander from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Professor Dennis Gray and Associate Professor Edward Wilkes from the National Drug Research Institute at Curtin University have added to the criticism, writing there was \u201clittle evidence of the scheme\u2019s efficacy\u201d. The article cites an Australian National Council on Drugs report which concluded \u201cthe empirical evidence for the effectiveness of compulsory treatment is inadequate and inconclusive\u201d. While they acknowledge some changes have been made to the policy, including decriminalising the act of absconding from a treatment centre, the authors say there are several concerning aspects, including a lack of evaluation and transparency. The government has released no data on relapse rates. \u201cIt is also disturbing that the scheme is openly targeted at \u2018chronic drinkers who are publicly intoxicated\u2019 \u2013 not all problem drinkers,\u201d they write. \u201cThis use of a medical intervention to deal with a perceived social problem should concern clinicians. \u201cFinally, it is disquieting that around $27m annually is being spent on a potentially discriminatory program lacking in evidence,\u201d reads the paper. It says 418 people were referred to the program in the year to June 2014, at an approximate cost of $64,000 per person. \u201cThere are a number of more cost-effective interventions that could be implemented in place of the AMT scheme, which would represent a significantly less punitive approach towards [alcohol and other drug]-dependent people in the NT,\u201d the paper says. Dr Tim Senior, a GP specialising in Indigenous health, told Guardian Australia any addiction treatments \u201ctend not to work unless the person wants to make the changes themselves.\u201d \u201cThe problem with mandatory [treatment] is it becomes a court process and the risk is that with what\u2019s actually a health problem, the response becomes a law and order approach and risks worsening some of the justice [outcomes],\u201d said Senior. \u201cIn the Northern Territory the Aboriginal prison population is huge, and it runs the risk of making that worse, and that itself has health consequences.\u201d Senior said there was also the danger of reinforcing negative stereotypes around Aboriginal people. \u201cAlcohol isn\u2019t just a problem in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities,\u201d he said. \u201cVery often the drinking is visible out of doors so it gets picked up, but in communities which are functioning quite well \u2013 and there are quite a few in the Northern Territory \u2013 alcohol is not a big problem \u2026 problems with drinking in non-Aboriginal communities just go on behind closed doors and don\u2019t get addressed.\u201d An expensive policy which is unsuccessful can \u201creinforce a negative stereotype that nothing works\u201d, Senior said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case, you just need to choose interventions that do work.\u201d AMTs are part of a suite of alcohol-related measures employed by the Northern Territory government, including stationing police officers outside bottle shops to check customers are not taking purchases back to proscribed dry communities. In April, the NT government indicated a step back from the policy when it announced it would not go ahead with a new alcohol rehabilitation centre in Katherine, but AMTs remain in place. A Senate inquiry report last week backs up the authors\u2019 claims with a recommendation that \u201cthe Northern Territory government prioritise the resourcing of voluntary alcohol treatment and rehabilitation programs in place of the Alcohol Mandatory Treatment program\u201d. The report also recommended reintroducing the banned drinkers register (BDR), which stops problem drinkers from buying alcohol. Despite frequent calls from the Labor opposition, the government has repeatedly refused to do so, claiming there was no evidence of its effectiveness. Last week, NT health minister John Elferink dismissed the BDR recommendation made in the Alcohol, Hurting People and Harming Communities report, which he conceded he had not read."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
