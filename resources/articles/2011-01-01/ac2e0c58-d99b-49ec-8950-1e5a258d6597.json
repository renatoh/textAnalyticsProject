Slow-burning funk basslines throb throughout, while singer Dave Best's whispered monotone feels uncomfortably intimate. There's a paced neurosis to Ventriloquizzing, with pill addictions, paranoia and crushing despondency on end track Universe, which has Best lost in the mantra: \"You love the sound of your own voice/ You are not the centre of the universe.\" The uneasy, implicit threat that runs through the album blisters up to the surface on the disturbing Sixteen Shades of Black &amp; Blue, when Best taunts, \"I'll beat you black/ I'll beat you blue\", and everything about Ventriloquizzing feels thrillingly tense, with layers of creeping analogue synths and taut, suave pop building up the pressure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
