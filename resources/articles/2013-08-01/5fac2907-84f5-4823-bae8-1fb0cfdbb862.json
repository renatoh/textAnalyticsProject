In partnership with IndigenousX, we're inviting its weekly host to tell us about who they are, what issues they're passionate about, and what they have in store for us during their upcoming week. Who are you, where are you from, what do you do? I am a Darug woman and descendant of Yarramundi, from the western suburbs of Sydney. I work in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child and family welfare. I currently work as a project officer at the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care, the peak national body that represents the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families. I am passionate about working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families, and working towards breaking the cycle that contributes to the high representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the child protection system. What do you plan to talk about on @Indigenous this week? 4 August 2013 is National Aboriginal and Islander Children's Day (NAIDC). This day is held annually to celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and to raise awareness in the general community about issues that impact on them. This year's theme for NAICD is Right Here, Right Now. Our Rights Matter. Through this theme, we seek to raise awareness about children's rights. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children too often still experience devastating realities across diverse areas of health, housing, education, care and protection, and removal from their homes and communities. In 2012, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the expert UN body mandated to monitor state parties compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, expressed particular concern about the serious and widespread discrimination against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Significant energy and resources are being invested in change. However, improvements continue to be hampered by the failure of our systems, processes and programs to draw on evidence of what works: local participation and ownership driving outcomes, holistic strategies responding to the causes of the problem, solutions coming from a strengths based approach within culture, and responsiveness to local context. This year's NAICD focus seeks to support outcomes through increasing public awareness about: \u2022 The major human rights concerns that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children still uniquely and disproportionately experience around the country \u2022 Special rights that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have as the Indigenous children of this country What issue affecting Indigenous people do you think is most pressing? Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children do not enjoy the same life chances as other Australian children and their rates in the child protection system is alarmingly high. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are 10.3 times more likely to enter out-of-home care than other children in Australia. More needs to be done to address these unacceptably high rates, such as a greater emphasis on preventative and early intervention strategies to support their families, as well as working towards addressing the systemic issues that contribute to Indigenous disadvantage. Our ultimate objective is to halve the number of children in out-of-home care by 2018, and to reduce the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care so that it is proportionate to their representation in the general Australian population by 2023. Who are your role models, and why? First and foremost, I would have to say my biggest role model is my mum, Joanne. Mum raised us four children all on her own, in the face of so much adversity. I have watched her struggle and work hard to ensure that her children had better outcomes than she did. Mum did not finish high school, however she supported all of us to not only finish high school, but to go on to and successfully complete further education. I can honestly say that I would not be the woman that I was today if it was not for her. My Nan, Thelma Melvaine, was also a major role model for me. She never seemed to let things get her down, and always had a funny story to tell. I treasure the time that I had with Nan before she passed into the Dreamtime, and hope that I can draw on her unbelievable strength and determination to continue to do my work. Professionally, I received some fantastic mentorship and guidance from one of my university lecturers, Dr Angelika Papadopoulos, throughout my university career. I am eternally grateful for the unwaiving support that Angelika has provided me over the years, especially during some very difficult times in my life. What are your hopes for the future? That there are improved outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families, including an increased emphasis on preventative and early intervention support models for vulnerable families, to reduce the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander entering the child protection system. I also would like to see the increased participation of and ownership by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander in decision that directly impact them, particularly around child protection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
