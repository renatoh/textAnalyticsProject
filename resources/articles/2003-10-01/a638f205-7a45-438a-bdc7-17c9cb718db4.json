A formal offer by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to buy the controversial property company could come within 10 days. But the offer is now expected to be at less than \u00a31.5 billion - more than \u00a3100 million lower than previously thought - or between 250p and 260p per share. When news of a bid for Canary broke last May it was thought the company would fetch about 300p per share. Sources at the investment banks are warning the whole deal could collapse if they cannot settle on an offer within 14 days. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are still trying to find a way of appeasing Michael Glick, the 9 per cent shareholder in Canary, without breaking Takeover Panel rules. Settling on debt to finance the deal is also proving difficult. If the bank consortium drops out, it will leave just Brascan, the Cana dian conglomerate, and Paul Reichman as possible buyers for the company. Reichman last week indicated he was preparing to bid for the company he founded 16 years ago but insiders doubt that he can arrange the levels of debt quickly. No details have emerged yet on Reichman's financing. It is thought that Reich man will stand to make more money if the individual Canary Wharf buildings were sold off, as this would exercise lucrative warrants in the company. Reichman holds 7.75 per cent in the firm. Brascan owns 9 per cent in Canary Wharf and is still committed to bidding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
