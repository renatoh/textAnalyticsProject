France confirms its openness to seize all opportunities,\" Mr De Villepin told reporters in Paris. It was the first slight hint that France may be prepared to come to an agreement on a new resolution, which is being pushed for by Britain, the US and Spain. Earlier, however, Mr De Villepin stated France's opposition to Britain's six tests for Iraqi disarmament, dismissing them as \"part of the logic of war\". But the prime minister, Tony Blair, who desperately needs UN backing for military action because of splits in his government and widespread public scepticism over an attack, did have other positive news from the US president, George Bush, who offered him a little more breathing space. The White House confirmed that the United States was prepared to allow the negotiations at UN headquarters in New York to run into next week in a final attempt to gain agreement in the 15-nation security council. Mr De Villepin's rejection of the six tests provoked a stinging attack from Downing Street over French President Jacques Chirac's declaration earlier this week that France would veto a new resolution \"whatever the circumstances\". Russia however indicated it would at least consider it. The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, cut short a visit to Tajikistan, saying he had to return to Moscow for consultations on the newest British proposal with President Vladimir Putin. The British proposal, unveiled yesterday at the UN security council, included a list of six steps the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, must take to avert war, including a television appearance renouncing weapons of mass destruction. The proposal is an attempt to narrow differences over a US-British-Spanish resolution in the United Nations giving Saddam a Monday deadline to disarm.The latest diplomatic manoeuvres were taking place against a background of quickening preparations for a war which many MPs at Westminster believe is now all but inevitable. Buckingham Palace announced that a planned visit next week by the Queen to Belgium had been postponed on the advice of ministers. Meanwhile, the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, ordered a further 850 infantry and medics to join the British forces massing in the Gulf. And Mr Blair briefed the Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, privately in Downing Street on the gathering crisis. The prospect that Britain may have to go to war without the authorisation of a new UN resolution was discussed by the cabinet, meeting for the first time since the international development secretary, Clare Short, threatened to quit. She stayed behind after the meeting for 50 minutes. As she left she responded to reporters' questions as to whether she was still a member of the Government with a one word answer, \"yes\", before being driven away. Mr Blair's spokesman refused to be drawn on what was discussed or on suggestions that the leader of the Commons, Robin Cook, had expressed similar concerns to Ms Short about going to war without a new resolution. \"There were a number of interventions and a number of points mad e across the cabinet table. I am not going to get into interpretation about what people said,\" the spokesman added. In other developments, Iraq's UN ambassador said Iraq will deliver a letter to UN inspectors late Thursday or Friday on measuring stocks of anthrax and VX nerve agents that have been destroyed. Weapons inspector dies in car crash A UN weapons inspector was killed and another was injured in a car crash south of Baghdad. A car carrying the two inspectors crashed head-on into a truck on a highway south of Baghdad, according to a statement from Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate, the liaison with the inspectors. The inspectors - whose nationalities were not given - were returning to Baghdad after inspecting the al-Noamaniya tomato canning factory, 50km (30 miles) south of Baghdad, it said. Inspectors' spokesman Hiro Ueki said one inspector was killed and one injured in what he called a traffic accident this afternoon, adding that he couldn't provide more details. He said the inspection team was investigating the crash."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
