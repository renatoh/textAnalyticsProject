The court-ordered questioning will be the first time the retired general, 88, has been forced to testify before a judge in a human rights case since the supreme court ruled in 2001 that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial in another case. The country's highest court stripped Gen Pinochet of his immunity from prosecution last Thursday in a case involving the deaths of 19 Chileans in the mid-1970s as part of Operation Condor, a joint effort by South American dictatorships to wipe out dissidents. Some 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Gen Pinochet's 17-year rule, which ended in 1990. Judge Juan Guzman will question the former dictator in his home on Monday, said a source who had access to Mr Guzman's legal order."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
