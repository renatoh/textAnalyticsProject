A spokesman for Hampshire police said: \"Detectives investigating the murder of Pennie Davis in the New Forest have arrested a man on suspicion of murder. The 36-year-old man was arrested in Southampton at 7.50pm and remains in police custody. Pennie's family has been informed.\" A week after the 47-year-old supermarket worker and mother of five was found at a paddock in Leygreen farm, Hampshire police also renewed their appeal for information, specifically anyone who might have seen her being followed. Davis, whose body was found by her husband, died from multiple stab wounds. A 22-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder was released on police bail on Monday evening. Police said detectives wanted to hear from anyone who saw someone acting suspiciously around Sainsbury's supermarket, Hampton Lane, Blackfield, where Davis worked, between 1pm and 3pm on 2 September. They also want to know if anyone saw Davis's car, a dark green Toyota Land Cruiser, during the drive from the supermarket to the farm. DS Paul Barton said: \"It's been a week since Pennie was murdered and in that time we've made significant progress, with more than 200 officers and staff working on the investigation. We're continuing to follow up several lines of enquiry and I'm really grateful to everyone who has called in with information. Since the start of the appeal we've received more than 230 messages from the public. \"Pennie had recently starting renting out the field but not many people were aware of that. One of our lines of enquiry therefore is the possibility she was followed from Blackfield Sainsbury's, where she'd been working that morning, to the paddock by Leygreen farm. I'd ask anyone with information, no matter how small or insignificant you think it may be, to contact us.\" Officers were revisiting the murder scene on Tuesday afternoon to speak to drivers, walker or others passing through, especially those who made the trip regularly. A statement released by Davis's husband, Pete, and her children, said they had endured \"a long, agonising week\". It said: \"The police have made progress, but there is still much more to be done. We only hope that no other family should ever have to go through the ordeal that we are currently facing. No other person deserves to ever have to go the way our poor mum and wife did. We will never begin to understand how scared and how alone she must have felt. \"This is why we are pleading for anybody with any information to come forward. Even if you think it won't make a difference, it might just be the call we were waiting for.\" As well as the 22-year-old freed on bail, a 37-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has also been bailed. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Operation Biscotti investigation team on 101. If you don't want to speak to the police directly, you can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. The charity is offering a \u00a35,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
