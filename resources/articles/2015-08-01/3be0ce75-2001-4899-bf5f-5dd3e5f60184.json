The Dow Jones Industrial average lost 586 points, or 3.56%, recovering slightly from when it plunged 1,089 points on Monday morning. The S&amp;P 500 lost about 3.9%, closing at a seven-month low, and Nasdaq lost 3.8%. Markets across the rest of the world suffered some of the biggest one-day falls this year, which greatly reduces the chance of the US Federal Reserve moving to increase interest rates in September \u2013 a move economists had expected. Despite the rollercoaster of stocks plunging, recovering and diving again, business seemed to be moving on Wall Street itself, as tourists snapped pictures of the New York stock exchange and traders rushed outside to grab a quick bite to eat or pick up delivery, saying they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the press. Those not working for the stock exchange offered candid viewpoints on the drama on Wall Street, with most advising against panic or worry because the numbers will sort themselves out. Two Deutsche Bank employees having lunch outside the stock exchange were unsurprised the events of the morning, and said they thought the fall was \u201ceasily predictable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not unexpected so we move forward,\u201d said one employee, declining to give his name. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for these kind of things.\u201d The White House issued a statement to reassure worried investors that the US economy would be able to withstand the global economic slowdown better than it did in 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a near-meltdown of the global banking system. \u201cThere is no doubt the global economy is more interconnected that it ever has been,\u201d Josh Earnest, Barack Obama\u2019s chief spokesman, said. \u201cWhat I would encourage people to evaluate is the ongoing strength and resilience of the US economy.\u201d Two attorneys going about their days on Wall Street agreed with Earnest\u2019s sentiment. Jon Werner, an attorney at Lyons and Flood, said in terms of long-term trends, there wasn\u2019t too much to worry about. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a sort of natural consequence to the repeated message that\u2019s been given by the Federal Reserve that we\u2019re going to end this era of low interest rates,\u201d Werner said. \u201cThat message has fallen on deaf ears for such a long time, so it finally seems to be getting some traction, with people feeling some uneasiness.\u201d Frank Stone, also an attorney for a private law firm who works with people involved in the stock exchange, said not to panic because the fall is an adjustment from which the market can bounce back. \u201cPeople are panicking because when you lost a lot of money, it\u2019s a very traumatic experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may take some time but it\u2019s going to come back. Hold tight and hold your breath.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
