Now the half-forgotten but fascinating life of trade union activist and British Communist party member Jessie Eden is set to play a key role in the much-anticipated fourth series of BBC2\u2019s period gang drama, Peaky Blinders. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in those people you see flashing by at the corner of your eye,\u201d says the show\u2019s creator Steven Knight. \u201cSo much of history concentrates on the memoirs of some politician or other but then in the middle of all that grey there\u2019s a flash of colour and that\u2019s Jessie \u2013 being female and working class there was very little prospect that she would become a household name but she did extraordinary things.\u201d Peaky Blinders first mentioned Eden last series when Helen McCrory\u2019s outspoken Aunt Pol and the rest of the Shelby women downed tools and headed out to hear the young firebrand speak at Birmingham\u2019s Bull Ring. This series, however, she will play a more central role as her desire for better conditions for her workers puts her on a collision course with enigmatic anti-hero Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy). \u201cIt\u2019s always been my intention to tackle the 1926 general strike as it was a time when the possibility of a genuine revolution was in the air,\u201d says Knight. \u201cBirmingham has always been a very radical, very unionised, very leftwing city so it was important for us to have someone on the show who represents that.\u201d It\u2019s true that even the briefest glimpses of Eden in history paint a tantalising picture of a determined working-class woman whose pragmatic, honest and articulate voice speaks vibrantly across the years. Her daughter-in-law Andrea McCulloch describes her as \u201cvery strong, committed in her beliefs. She was sort of person you might underestimate because she was small and vulnerable-looking but then \u2013 bang. You didn\u2019t want to underestimate her. By the time I knew her she was a sweet old lady but her sister-in-law Noreen told me she could tear you off a strip if you did something she didn\u2019t approve of.\u201d That strength in her convictions can be heard in Eden\u2019s account of her time on the frontline of the 1926 strike. Talking to the Birmingham Post in 1976 she said: \u201cOne policeman put his hands on my arms. They were telling me to go home, but the crowd howled \u2026 \u2019Hey, leave her alone\u2019\u2026 and some men came and pushed the policemen away. They didn\u2019t do anything after that. I think they could see there would have been a riot. I was never frightened of the police or the troops because I had the people with me, you see.\u201d Graham Stevenson, convenor of the Communist History Group, knew Eden during her later life and says that her commitment to her causes remained undimmed. \u201cMy memory is of a physically frail and, by then, small person but her personality was still clearly bold, fearless and indomitable,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople say that in her prime she was an electrifying speaker, who poured out words from the heart without notes and whose confidence in victory was contagious. I\u2019m sure she would be tickled pink at the attention her name has had in recent years \u2013 although I\u2019d guess her reaction to the playing with dates and events would be similar to mine but even harsher!\u201d Charlie Murphy, the Irish actress who plays Eden, agrees that the young activist\u2019s voice feels as relevant now as it did then. \u201cOne of the things I find most fascinating is where she drew that strength from,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s an extraordinary woman, very brave, very passionate and she really put her neck on the line, not just for women but for everyone.\u201d In 1931, Eden\u2019s passion for justice saw her lead 10,000 women out on strike for a week in a dispute over attempts to link workers\u2019 pay to the speed of performance. \u201cThey told me they were timing me\u2026 the fact was that I\u2019d always worked quickly\u2026 they obviously wanted to set the time by me and the others would have had to keep up,\u201d Eden explained. The strike worked and the system was dropped but Eden found herself singled out at work and eventually lost her job. She would later receive victimisation pay from the Transport and General Workers Union and a gold medal from its then leader, Ernest Bevin. A mysterious spell in Moscow (reportedly helping to rally female workers in the construction of the Moscow Metro) followed before Eden returned to Birmingham and was soon caught up in campaigning for better conditions for tenants. She stood for the Communist party in Handsworth in the 1945 general election winning 3.4% of the vote and would continue to protest until late in her life \u2013 an image from the late 60s shows her marching alongside husband Walter against the war in Vietnam. \u201cTo the very end her one true love seems to have been justice, fairness and equality,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cShe comes across as a very inspirational person to be around and I\u2019m sure that rubbed off on so many people.\u201d McCulloch agrees: \u201cTo Jessie protest was simply the right thing to do,\u201d she says. \u201cIf she knew that a character based on her was in Peaky Blinders today I think she would have been pleased and really keen to have got the message across: anyone can make a difference, if you have the drive.\u201d Peaky Blinders returns to BBC2 in the week beginning 12 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
