Along with his partner, April Walsh, Wheeler spent Wednesday the same way he\u2019s spent every day since Sunday: engulfed in smoke. The Rumba Dump fire \u2013 as it is known \u2013 tore over the ridgeline overlooking their property on the weekend and has spent the days since spreading along the mountains that surround them on three sides. The two of them explained \u2013 while running back and forth from the creeping fire front with hoses and cheering the helicopters who dumped a steady load of water onto the blaze \u2013 that this was, in fact, nothing. \u201cWe were here until 2am, maybe 2.30am this morning,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThat whole mountain across from us was glowing, literally glowing. I have never seen anything like it.\u201d \u201cIt just keeps changing direction,\u201d Walsh added. \u201cIt was coming down from one direction, then it was coming from the other side of the hill, then it was going back the other way again. It\u2019s all around us.\u201d This fire alone had already burned through more than 27,000 hectares by Wednesday afternoon, and remained out of control in a number of places including Killabakh, which lies about 20km north of Taree. The damage could easily be missed. Nearby on Wednesday Guardian Australia stumbled upon the abandoned remains of a burnt-out home at the end of a rough cattle track, its singed solar panels still standing amid the ruins. All told, the hundreds of bushfires across New South Wales have now ripped through more than 1 million hectares across the state, amid an unprecedented bushfire emergency still unfolding before the Australian summer has even begun. North of the border in Queensland, where at least 14 homes were destroyed, heavy winds caused havoc through most of Wednesday, whipping fire fronts through thousands of hectares of dry bushland. On Thursday morning, 61 fires were still burning in NSW, while 80 were still alight in Queensland. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Wednesday evening that 400 people had been evacuated from the town of Buxton, 76km south of Bundaberg. \u201cThe fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community,\u201d Queensland Fire and Emergency Services warned. Firefighting crews were battling more than 80 fires on the ground in that state, though there was hope that easing weather conditions could bring a reprieve on Thursday. At Pechey, north of Toowoomba, one of two emergency level fires, a privately owned water-bombing helicopter crash-landed in gusting winds, tipping onto its side and injuring the 70-year-old pilot. The pilot was taken to hospital in a stable condition, but the abandonment of the helicopter posed a significant problem for firefighters worried it could explode as the fast-moving fire front moved through the area. Homes in Noosa North Shore were evacuated for the second time in a week, as a bushfire returned to the bushland area connected to the Sunshine Coast holiday strip by a river ferry. And in the Scenic Rim and the hinterland of the Gold Coast, where multiple fires were burning, authorities said any changes to wind patterns could be devastating overnight. The Scenic Rim mayor, Greg Christensen, said the situation was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and there was a 90km stretch covered by active fire. \u201cI\u2019m concerned certain wind conditions could push rapidly towards some communities. I\u2019m equally concerned that the fire has the potential if wind conditions are right to cause ember attacks to the north ... and that could threaten a number of residents,\u201d he said. Across the country in Western Australia, a bushfire reportedly destroyed two homes and damaged two others in Geraldton. The mayor, Shane Van Styn, said he had been told about property loss at Utakarra but it was yet to be officially confirmed. Wednesday brought some reprieve in NSW after Tuesday\u2019s catastrophic fire danger, but there were still dozens of blazes keeping firefighters and residents busy. Just south of Killabakh, in the suburb of Hillville, a fire was briefly upgraded to emergency level again on Wednesday thanks to gusting winds that seemed to make spot fires break out at will. Geert Lampen\u2019s home there was spared, though only just, thanks to two helicopters relentlessly water-bombing a fire as it approached his home. \u201cThis place has been like an airport,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Lampen\u2019s family evacuated earlier in the week along with much of the suburb, but he stayed behind to protect his home. When the wind picked up on Wednesday morning it pushed the fire that had burned more than 22,000 hectares in a north-westerly direction and towards his home. \u201cIt\u2019s scary, you know, when the fire has been coming and you knew it was coming but all you could do was try to prepare and basically be on lockdown. You just do what you can.\u201d More than 50 properties were destroyed on Tuesday while firefighters dealt with some 300 blazes across the state. But there were still some 73 fires burning, 50 of which were uncontained. In smoke-filled Taree, residents waited nervously for news at the packed-out evacuation centres. Both the Taree and nearby Wingham\u2019s showgrounds were at full capacity, while families were setting up makeshift camps at an evacuation centre at Club Taree, with cars parked up to the gates. \u201cYou just think, how long is your luck going to last?\u201d Sharon Chamberlain told AAP as she fed her neighbours\u2019 horses, left behind at the evacuation centre as their owners battled blazes. \u201cWhen you lock the door for the last time and you walk away, and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be there when you get back, that\u2019s one of the hardest things. \u201cHow much more are we expected to take?\u201d The commissioner of the Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons, said on Wednesday that many firefighters were feeling \u201cdeflated\u201d after a gruelling running battle. Many residents feel the same. \u201cI\u2019m just exhausted,\u201d one woman in a nearby general store told Guardian Australia. \u201cEverything has been packed up for days, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m coming or going.\u201d The people here have gotten used to living in thick smoke. In Rainbow Flat, where fires destroyed a number of properties on Friday last week, people were still coming to terms with what has happened. Col Meredith was one of the few who stayed behind in the small village when fires tore through on Friday night. Col\u2019s house survived, but his neighbour a few hundred metres up the road wasn\u2019t so lucky. Despite helping to protect his and a few other neighbours\u2019 homes, he feels guilty he wasn\u2019t able to stop the fire tearing through his friend\u2019s property. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sleeping, just lying in bed about midnight hearing the crash of the trees. I heard a big bang and thought it was just another tree but when I came back here in the morning, it was the roar of the house going.\u201d A few days later, he\u2019s still reliving Friday night. It was scary, he said, to watch the speed at which the fire moved up the ridge near his home. \u201cIt\u2019s an adrenaline rush, you know, I slept four hours last night and that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve slept in days. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m aching but I was still up at 5am,\u201d he said. Police investigations have begun into some of the NSW fires, while two men have been charged with possessing RFS equipment, with one reportedly seen in the Royal national park dressed as a firefighter. A local mayor, Jennifer Anderson, slammed potential arson in the the Sydney suburb of South Turramurra as an \u201calmost unimaginable\u201d act during Tuesday\u2019s catastrophic fire conditions. \u201cAs mayor it seems almost unimaginable that someone would put our community in such danger,\u201d she said. At one point, 16 fires were simultaneously at \u201cemergency\u201d level as Greater Sydney, Greater Hunter and Illawarra-Shoalhaven had the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d rating and despite remaining dangerous on Wednesday the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, admitted she was \u201chugely relieved\u201d that there had been no further deaths since the weekend, when three people died in rural NSW. \u201cI have to confess to being hugely relieved this morning that yesterday our amazing volunteers and emergency service personnel withstood the catastrophic conditions and did manage to save life and property,\u201d Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
