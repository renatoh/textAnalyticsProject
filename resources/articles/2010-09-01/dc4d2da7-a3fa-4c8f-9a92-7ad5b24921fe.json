The panic and fear doesn't help. Like the writer of the piece, Andrew Penman, I faced finding a secondary school in Merton for my son. I considered church schools but, for me, that would have been lying. I tutored my son for the grammar schools but the odds of 10/1 aren't great, even for bright boys. Private schools are too expensive. However, I held firm and my son is attending Rutlish school, the same school that sent Mr Penman running. Guess what? My son has been at Rutlish for a year, is very happy and learning well. Good behaviour and good results are expected (this summer's GCSE results are now 10% above the national average at A*-C). Positive stories about schools with pupils of mixed ability, social and racial diversity will do more for state education, our children and our society as a whole than more pages of cynical parents, running scared. Christina Strupinska Brown London \u2022 While one sympathises with Andrew Penman and his struggle to find a secondary school for his son, surely the answer is not to up sticks but to get involved at his local senior school from day one \u2013 to join the PTA, to participate, to speak to teachers, to be as supportive as possible. Schools value concerned parents like Mr Penman (although his faking of religious belief for a primary school place is despicable). No school can do it all themselves. The best schools are a partnership between the school and the local community. Roger Tagholm London \u2022 Andrew Penman could have saved himself and his family \"three years of confusion and distress\", not to mention vast sums of money, if he had been a little more open-minded. Andrew acknowledges that \"there was a very good school in Tooting, but Tooting has had a couple too many murders for my tastes\". Well, I've lived a few minutes' walk from the school in question for 30 years and my children, both now through university and out the other side, were educated there. None of us has been murdered. Nor have we murdered anyone. Jean Ettridge London \u2022 In your informative article about the Heygate estate's use as a film set (Blowing more than the doors off \u2013 end of film-makers' favourite estate, 4 September) you incorrectly say that the estate had a \"reputation for violence\". My family lived there for 30 years and it wasn't a violent place to grow up \u2013 its a reputation that's largely been acquired by its use as a film set. The article might also have spared a line to ask why the estate is now empty, if it was formerly home to a \"thriving community\", and where that community has gone to? The answer is to other council houses not much better, or worse, than the ones on the Heygate \u2013 Southwark council reneged on its promise to build new ones. Jerry Flynn London \u2022\u2008The research from the Institute of Education and Bristol University regarding Brighton and Hove's much lauded system of secondary admissions is an important case study (Middle-class pupils still winners despite admissions lottery, 3 September). It provides clear evidence that lotteries are no panacea for social injustice in school admissions. My own research has also shown a significant concentration of children eligible for free school meals within schools catering for the city's most deprived areas. As further cohorts move to secondary school, it appears likely that the gap between schools serving poorer areas and those in more affluent parts of the city will widen further. As the latest report suggests, children eligible for free school meals \"were 'slightly' more likely to be at school with other pupils on free school meals under Brighton's lottery system than under the previous system\". With the fixed catchments taking their toll year on year, even \"slight\" increases in social segregation have the potential to become increasingly significant. As this new research highlights, random allocation may yet offer some potential for addressing increasing segregation. However, this can only be achieved if it is combined with other methods such as fair banding or more socially inclusive catchments, thereby facilitating more balanced intakes. Otherwise lotteries may be little more than a figleaf of social justice for local authorities, while social segregation increases as a result of other system features. Keith Turvey Senior lecturer, University of Brighton \u2022\u2008 Your article concludes, rightly, with a reference to the decline in foreign language study (Social class affects white pupils' exam results, 3 September). The current threat to language-learning risks widening the social divide still further: there is a danger that the social confidence and career advantages which bilingualism bring will be restricted to children whose parents actively support or finance their languages education. This discrimination would represent a return to the years when languages were studied exclusively in independent and grammar schools. Recent progress in introducing language diversity in primary schools is now at risk. Poorer white monolingual pupils and bilingual pupils from minority ethnic groups are all set to lose out if language-learning is not made part of the compulsory curriculum. Enthusiastic teachers have worked hard to develop young children's language skills and research has identified gains in overall literacy development where pupils have access to more than one language. Should this initiative fail through lack of support, the poor will get poorer \u2013 and the social advantages of linguistic competence will remain with the rich.
