The federal government is holding a Covid-19 meeting with GPs and workers in primary care. While there have been 52 cases confirmed in Australia, with no sustained community transmission, new cases are identified every day. The source of infection is unclear in three cases. Sydney GP Richard Nguyen said he felt \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d for patients that may start coming to his practice with symptoms or for testing. \u201cThere has been a lack of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any GP practices that would be capable of testing or seeing a suspected case. In our practice we have four consult rooms plus a procedure room. We\u2019d have to dedicate one room as an isolation room. And then you\u2019d have to clean and disinfect the room \u2013 logistically it\u2019s just impossible for several reasons, including that we don\u2019t have the physical space.\u201d The head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, said it was clear not enough information was being shared with frontline health workers including emergency doctors and general practitioners. \u201cOf course, you don\u2019t hear from the doctors who are comfortable with the situation, but I have had many examples of doctors who are worried and concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are worried that personal protective equipment is in short supply. Plus much general practice is a private enterprise largely independently owned and so if a lot of them need additional supplies from their own resourcing it\u2019s quite prohibitive. \u201cPeople are concerned about a lack of preparedness and capacity. Doctors need clear messaging about what\u2019s expected of them.\u201d He said by the end of Friday\u2019s meeting, \u201cI want everyone to feel comfortable\u201d. \u201cI want them to feel they have the equipment they need in a timely manner and that they have ongoing access to reliable information.\u201d Guardian Australia has been told that as well as Telehealth, part of the response will include establishing dedicated coronavirus clinics so that emergency hospital beds can be reserved for the most sick patients and so that other GP clinics would not be overwhelmed. But it has not been made clear at what point in widespread transmission those dedicated clinics will be established or how they will be chosen. A doctors group on Facebook included one doctor expressing concern that doctors did not have enough protective equipment, including surgical masks. \u201cTime is running out to get this sorted,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSome GP\u2019s are immunosuppressed, some are elderly, I have a daughter with Cystic Fibrosis. Who will speak up for us?\u201d The health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Thursday that the government had 20m masks in the national medical stockpile. \u201cWe have made supplies available to general practices through two rounds of allocation to what are called the primary health networks with those general practices that have needed them for their purposes have been able to obtain them. Part of tomorrow\u2019s work with the general practices is to identify any further and additional needs. So I think we have already been assisting and allocating,\u201d he said. The president of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, Dr John Bonning, said emergency doctors would have a vital role to play in the response to coronavirus, and that despite \u201csignificant challenges\u201d the virus might present, doctors would be dedicated to caring for their patients and collaborating with other health workers, institutions and the government. \u201cThe whole of our healthcare systems from primary care through to and beyond hospitals will have to rise to this challenge, with all healthcare professionals working within their scope to mitigate the surge,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of this must be ensuring that all healthcare providers perform their duties and responsibilities within the whole-of-system response, which includes hospitals both public and private, pathology labs, and general and private practice. \u201cIt is also important to ensure that there are a range of testing facilities and treatment options; not just in public hospitals and via their emergency departments; available to the community to mitigate risks, particularly for vulnerable groups in society.\u201d The Greens spokesperson for health, Richard Di Natale, a doctor who has worked in infection control, said overall chief medical officers from the commonwealth and states and territories had led a strong response to the coronavirus situation. But he said it was essential those directly responding to possible cases had an ongoing, sufficient supply of personal protective equipment. \u201cThe government must seek to provide urgent assurance to GPs and other frontline workers that this supply can be confirmed,\u201d he said.
