Ten lengths winner of this race three years ago, First Gold returned to his best when equipped with blinkers in the spring, winning top races at Aintree and Punchestown. The blinkers were left off when First Gold had a satisfactory warm-up at Auteuil recently. Set against First Gold's record, Jair Du Cochet looks a short price after winning a dubious race, form-wise, at Huntingdon, while Fondmort's stamina has to be taken on trust. KEMPTON 12.40: This is a step up in class for Dempsey , but Mark Pitman also entered the five-year-old for the Christmas Hurdle and clearly holds Dempsey in high regard. KEMPTON 1.10: Impressive winner of the Hennessy, Strong Flow would not have been out of place in the King George VI Chase line-up. WETHERBY 1.25: Flagship Uberalles has run his best races after a longer lay-off than this, and he could struggle to give 10lb to Isio . KEMPTON 1.45: The Tote's 25-1 about Ulundi for the Christmas Hurdle looks outstanding value. With doubts about Rooster Booster and Intersky Falcon after their latest starts, and the four-year-old Sporazene with something to prove at this level, Ulundi is a fascinating contender. Trainer Paul Webber, who has his horses in great form, reports Ulundi right back to his best after an operation on his wind. This former winner of the Scottish Champion Hurdle will be competitive here if he can translate last year's smart Flat form to timber. The fast track and good ground give him every chance of doing just that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
