The bank's executives were locked in talks this weekend with UK Financial Investments (UKFI), which owns 43% of Lloyds, to secure taxpayer backing for more than \u00a3250bn of assets as part of a Treasury-backed insurance scheme. A debate over the cost of the insurance is understood to be at the heart of a dispute between bank executives and UKFI representatives. The government wants \u00a34bn worth of preference shares, at a cost to the bank of \u00a3480m a year in dividend payments, for the insurance. As part of the deal, the government has also told Lloyds it must sign legally binding agreements to lend at least \u00a310bn more to small businesses and households. Under normal rules the large number of shares issued to the government would increase its shareholding above 50%. But the complex talks are understood to be close to converting the insurance bill into other share instruments in such a way that the taxpayer's stake does not increase above 43%. Also under discussion is the level of bonuses paid to Lloyds staff. Reports yesterday suggested that UKFI had ordered Lloyds to rethink its plans to pay out bonuses and tie them closer to the bank's performance. Talks began last month between UKFI and Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland after it became obvious that both banks would need a boost in funding to survive a severe recession. A deal was hammered out with RBS ahead of its annual results last week. Stephen Hester, RBS chief executive, was forced to agree a larger shareholding by the government in the bank as the price for the deal. The government holding in RBS jumped from 69% to more than 90% after the deal was signed. However, Eric Daniels, the boss of Lloyds, has spent the last week struggling to construct a complex deal that will allow him to buy the insurance without increasing the government shareholding. Lloyds has argued that it should be protected from further government ownership because most of its losses can be attributed to HBOS, which it agreed to rescue last year. HBOS has since revealed billions of pounds of losses and faces the prospect of further write-downs. The bank wants to issue new shares that would give the government the right to dividend payments before ordinary shareholders, but would not give them votes over the way the bank is run. Such shares would allow the government to help Lloyds achieve its aim of remaining less than 50%-owned by the government. Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vince Cable said over the weekend that he wanted the government to press for a tough deal. He said: \"It looks inevitable that Lloyds will now require further taxpayer support, but if this is the case it must be in return for a further stake in the company.\" He said: \"The Government must bite the bullet and realise that it may need effective public control of both Lloyds and RBS. This will be needed to ensure lending to sound borrowers; clean up the gross remuneration practices, as illustrated by Goodwin's pension, and to stop abuses like tax avoidance which are taking place on a large scale inside the bank.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
