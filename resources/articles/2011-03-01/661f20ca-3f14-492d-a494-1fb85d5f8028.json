Don't read on if you haven't seen episode eight Dan Martin's episode seven blog The One Where Mitchell gets staked, and so everything else really fades into insignificance. \"I'm doing this because I love you.\" Normally when a series ends with such a staggering brutal denouement, the instinct is to think, \"well I didn't see that one coming.\" Not so here. Mitchell's demise has been the point of this entire series, foreshadowed since episode one, and kind of inevitable ever since that fateful day in the Box Tunnel last year. Add to that Aidan Turner's casting in The Hobbit and fans' hopes of \"say it ain't so!\" looked all the more futile. We can only assume Mitchell really is dead, since so much is made about the staking being a death that vampires can't come back from. But since the whole series has really been about Mitchell's demise, we wonder whether Aidan was already leaving and it was written to allow his exit? Or was it always the plan to write the character out? Either way, this was a heartstopping episode from the off. We're reminded of Mitchell's rant to Annie in The Pack about how there is no fate. His struggle with Lia's prophecy sent him crazy, so looking back it was inevitable that the prophecy would be a self-fulfilling one. The fact that Lia made the whole thing up in a botched attempt at revenge ties all of what we thought were varying strands together and into the hands of one angry young dead girl, sat in a bedroom in Purgatory. And the tender showdown as Annie tells Lia (Lacey Turner, fabulous once more) that \"bitterness and revenge are not things to get drunk\" was just one of the moments where this finale hit new peaks entirely. There's almost too many to mention. Herrick's ringmastery at the dogfight cage, as he theatrically taunts George into doing in Mitchell (\"at half-time we were going to have a Nespresso!). There was McNair's tear-jerking farewell letter to Tom, where he revealed himself as a man of soul and courage. There was Mitchell and Herrick's final moment of serenity on the cliff-face, as one stakes the other and accepts his own destiny. It was all too much, even before that final sequence. Now, George was going to be the wolf-shaped bullet. That was always fairly obvious. But the way it was done, out of love, not of rage, was what brought us to our knees. George already knew that Mitchell was the killer, and Mitchell couldn't stand to see his friend's soul compromised by knowing that. Even then, I think George would have chickened out (so to speak). It took the arrival of Wyndham and his demand that Mitchell become his attack dog, that George couldn't stand to see Mitchell endure. They say a true friend is one you would kill for. Here, it's one that you would kill. So. Did Mitchell die a hero? A martyr? A coward? Would he really have killed again? And if so, is that a quality of the man, or the vampire? If Mitchell's quest to go clean was ultimately doomed, what does that mean for say, Adam in Becoming Human? For any vampire? Whichever way, we'll miss the hot Irish vampire and his leather jacket and his fingerless gloves and his roll-up cigarettes. Your favourite Mitchell memories, please. Lest we forget. Supernature As a final flourish, we witness the arrival of Edgar Wyndham, one of the fabled \"Old Ones\" to clean up the mess. Wyndham can enter a house without being invited in (\"you don't live for a thousand years without learning a trick or two.\") He's more powerful, and far worse we are told, than Herrick. We found him a bit pantomime to be honest, but he did field some tantalising clues. There's something special about each one of them \u2013 George and Nina's pregnancy is apparently a werewolf first. Annie, he suspects, is more powerful than she imagines. So he's letting them all stick around \u2026 for now. Pop Culture Notes Mitchell is dead, so this is no time to be thinking about silly things like that. Although it was lovely to get one last little mention on The Real Hustle. We think we got a bit of something in our eye there. So Now What? And so the best series yet ends with our remaining heroes standing shoulder-to-shoulder, like the Power Rangers via This Life, facing off against Wyndham. \"You're going to have a fight on your hands,\" says George. So that's series four set up. But still, Being Human now finds itself in a precarious position. Plenty of shows lose principal actors, but this was one founded on some very specific characters, in some very specific circumstances. It can now never go back to its cosy flatshare beginnings, and any hopes of domesticity are out of the window with Wyndham onto them. There can be no looming threat in series four (and there will surely be one), from the off it's going to be a battle. Or, indeed, might the threat of the Old Ones prove to be prolonged than that? If Wyndham is the new lead vampire, that changes the dynamic completely. And Turner was a hugely popular lead actor, despite the equal billing of the cast. Could we see a new flatmate move into Honolulu Heights? Maybe Adam could come back full time? We might just got some clues sooner than we think. There's a Being Human panel at Mark Millar's Kapow Comic Con in London next month, where hopefully we might get at least a few answers. But in the meantime \u2026 what a journey. What have been your highlights of Being Human's third year? And what do you want from series four?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
