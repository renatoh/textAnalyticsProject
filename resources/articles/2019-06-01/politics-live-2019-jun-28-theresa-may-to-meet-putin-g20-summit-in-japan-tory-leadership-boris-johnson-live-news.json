The UK prime minister and Russian president shared a frosty handshake at the start of their meeting. May\u2019s spokeswoman said the PM had told Russia the UK had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d Moscow was behind the attack. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt faced questions from Tory members at the latest leadership hustings in Exeter. Johnson reiterated his promise that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October and refused to rule out proroguing parliament to circumvent MPs blocking a no-deal exit. Hunt on the other hand said he did not see 31 October as a hard deadline. He said if there is a deal in sight, he would not rip it up and leave without one. Hunt ruled out bringing May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to another Commons vote. One of the questions was about Iran, with Johnson praising Donald Trump for \u201ctalking sense\u201d on the country and accusing Tehran of being \u201cbent on all sorts of mischief\u201d. He added: \u201cWe need to very vigilant about Iran and that government.\u201d Hunt spoke about his regret over the handling of the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, which began in 2016. It ended this week when junior doctors agreed a new contract, which comes with an 8.2% pay rise over four years. \u201cWhat I realised is I wasn\u2019t getting [the] message across to junior doctors themselves,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI was getting the message across to Conservative members, but not these 51,000 junior doctors, who work amazingly hard and are the future of the NHS.\u201d The Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, said the EU would not reopen the withdrawal agreement, no matter who became the next prime minister. He told a summit in Manchester the EU \u201cmean what we say\u201d. Ian Paisley challenged the BBC over a programme that made claims about him taking luxury foreign holidays. He said the broadcaster should provide evidence to the parliamentary standards commissioner. Paisley told the BBC: \u201cIf the BBC think I have done anything wrong, all the BBC has to do is to submit evidence to the parliamentary commissioner. The independent authority can examine on all of those matters and make their own ruling. That\u2019s the only comment I can make.\u201d That\u2019s it from us for today. Thanks very much for following and your comments BTL. Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said whoever became the UK\u2019s next prime minister would get a \u201cfair hearing\u201d from the EU but warned \u201cwe mean what we say\u201d about not re-opening negotiations on the withdrawal agreement. Varadkar spoke alongside the UK\u2019s minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, and Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, at the end of a British-Irish Council summit meeting in Manchester. He said \u201cit needs to be understood that we mean what we say\u201d. \u201cThat is: the withdrawal agreement won\u2019t be re-opened, without a backstop there will be no transition period or implementation phase, but that we are willing to examine the joint political declaration and make amendments to that if that enables us to proceed to an orderly Brexit with a guarantee there will be no hard border between north and south, which is our shared objective.\u201d Lidington said Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt had both said they did not want a no-deal Brexit, and it was important to \u201ctake their word on that\u201d. He also said it was clear tariffs and checks would be applied to UK trade on day one of a \u201cno-deal crash-out\u201d. But he said there would be a window when EU leaders would want to hear what Theresa May\u2019s successor had to say, and the government\u2019s position was still to leave with a deal. Sturgeon said there was a \u201creal danger\u201d of no-deal becoming inevitable \u2013 and it was futile to waste time trying to re-negotiate. Theresa May has called the Salisbury poisoning a \u201ctruly despicable act\u201d. Ian Paisley has challenged the BBC to present any evidence of alleged wrongdoing to a parliamentary watchdog following the latest claims about him taking luxury foreign holidays. Paisley said the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, could examine the issues raised. The DUP North Antrim MP declined to be drawn on the specifics of Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s BBC Spotlight programme, which included a claim that an undeclared family holiday to the Maldives was partly paid for by a former government minister in the Indian Ocean country. Paisley told the BBC: \u201cIf the BBC think I have done anything wrong, all the BBC has to do is to submit evidence to the parliamentary commissioner. \u201cThe independent authority can examine on all of those matters and make their own ruling. That\u2019s the only comment I can make.\u201d Asked if his constituents deserved a fuller explanation, he added: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my constituents; my constituents and me have a very good and sound relationship.\u201d Paisley was suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days for \u201cserious misconduct\u201d for failing to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka in 2013. The MP survived parliament\u2019s first ever recall petition. Local independents have prised away a seat in Mansfield previously held by a Labour councillor who narrowly defeated them to win a mayoral poll in May. The Labour loss came at the hands of the Mansfield Independent Forum in the Sandhurst ward of Mansfield district council. The seat had been vacated by Labour\u2019s Andy Abrahams after he won the directly elected Mansfield mayoral poll on 2 May. He won by just two votes against the Mansfield Independent Forum candidate, Kate Allsop, in the second round of counting under the single transferable vote system. Mansfield Independent Forum now has 14 of the 36 seats on the council, while Labour also has 14 plus the mayoralty. Theresa May has told Vladimir Putin \u201cthe use of a deadly nerve agent\u201d in Salisbury was \u201cpart of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour\u201d during a bilateral at the G20. The UK prime minister and Russian president shared a frosty handshake at the start of their meeting. May\u2019s spokeswoman said the PM had told Russia the UK had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d Moscow was behind the attack.

He added: \u201cWe need to very vigilant about Iran and that government.\u201d Hunt spoke about his regret over the handling of the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, which began in 2016. It ended this week when junior doctors agreed a new contract, which comes with an 8.2% pay rise over four years. \u201cWhat I realised is I wasn\u2019t getting [the] message across to junior doctors themselves,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI was getting the message across to Conservative members, but not these 51,000 junior doctors, who work amazingly hard and are the future of the NHS.\u201d Hunt believes \u201cit is wrong for parliament to take no deal off the table \u2026 if they do that, we\u2019re less likely to get a deal.\u201d He has now left the stage to bring the hustings to an end. Hunt says he would \u201clove\u201d to have Boris Johnson in his cabinet if he becomes prime minister, saying \u201che has changed the course of our history through his leadership of the leave campaign\u201d. Hunt says he cannot understand why there are \u201cfar too many drugs in our prisons\u201d. He believes too many young people leave school without sufficient reading and writing skills. Hunt also cites a study in Iceland about how parents spending time with their children led to young people being less likely to develop problems including obesity. The foreign secretary has spoken of his regrets over the handling of the junior doctors dispute, which began in 2016 and he described as \u201cbitter and difficult\u201d. \u201cWhat I realised is I wasn\u2019t getting [the] message across to junior doctors themselves,\u201d Hunt says. \u201cI was getting the message across to Conservative members, but not these 51,000 junior doctors, who work amazingly hard and are the future of the NHS. \u201cWhat I learned is as Conservatives, we have to be better on social media. They are getting information from Facebook and Twitter. \u201cAs prime minister, I want to approach social media in a different way, your thinking, dilemmas. I am not saying go Trump on social media, but we have to engage.\u201d Hunt has ruled out bringing Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement back before the House of Commons. On why he will not commit to leaving the EU by 31 October, he said: \u201cIf you make it a hard deadline and parliament stops you then you have to have a general election \u2026 and we would be crucified.\u201d Hunt said character mattered in choosing the next Tory leader but politicians\u2019 private lives should not be part of the process. \u201cWe all have things in our private life, things that we did 20 years ago that we would not want our mum and dad to find out about \u2026 I\u2019ve got lots and I\u2019m not going to tell you, Ian, sorry \u2013 and my wife is sitting in the front row, so that\u2019s another reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when we are in a constitutional crisis, frankly the biggest constitutional crisis of my lifetime, it demeans that competition if we start having huge discussions about people\u2019s private lives, and I think we should stick to the issues facing the country.\u201d On university tuition fees, Hunt said: \u201cI do worry some of the courses do not offer students value for money, if you have \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000 debt and do not have the prospect of earning enough to pay that debt back.\u201d He added: \u201cI cannot justify why the interest rate on student loans is 6%, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. It risks discrediting the system.\u201d Jeremy Hunt has said he is committed to HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail, but delays to its opening are frustrating, comparing it to the railway network in Osaka being built within two years. He added that \u201cthe train service to Devon and Cornwall is totally inadequate\u201d. When asked whether he would abolish inheritance and capital gains tax, Hunt said: \u201cI would like to reduce lots of taxes. \u201cInheritance tax is one of the most unfair taxes. I said I would have a radical cut to corporation tax to fire up the economy.\u201d Hunt added that business rates are \u201cabsolutely crippling\u201d. On the proposal for milkshakes to be covered by the sugar tax, Hunt said he spent six years trying not to go into McDonald\u2019s during his time as health secretary, but eventually succumbed to temptation. \u201cI like my milkshakes. We do need to tackle our obesity crisis. It disproportionately affects people from poorer families,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quickest way is for people who manufacture milkshakes to reduce the sugar in them. You threaten them, you don\u2019t need to follow through with the dreaded sugar tax.\u201d Jeremy Hunt has said 31 October is not a \u201chard deadline\u201d for Britain to exit the EU. \u201cWe both [he and Boris Johnson] want to get out by 31 October,\u201d he said. If there is a deal in sight in the week leading up to it, I am not going to rip the whole thing out and leave. I would be prepared to leave without a deal if there isn\u2019t one in sight.\u201d On Theresa May\u2019s talks with Vladimir Putin today at the G20 summit, Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cIt is possible to rebuild relations if Russia changes its behaviour. Last year, Russia used chemical weapons on British soil [in Salisbury]. My worry about Russia is they are up to their old tricks. \u201cMy dad was in the navy \u2013 thanks to that generation, we won the cold war. I will increase spending on defence by 2.5% [of] GDP over five years.\u201d Jeremy Hunt promises to get more young people to vote Conservative and pledges he will not cause an election before delivering on Brexit. The foreign secretary said that if elected he would be the \u201cfirst prime minister you have had who was an entrepreneur\u201d. He told the audience: \u201cWhat do entrepreneurs do? We negotiate. You have to be prepared to walk away if you don\u2019t get the deal you want. Secondly, you have to figure out what the other guys want to do.\u201d Jeremy Hunt is on stage. He begins by asking the audience, if you live in Devon for two years as he did, are you a local or a \u201cgrockle\u201d? The audience seems to go with the latter. Guardian readers have been discussing Brexit, Vladimir Putin and the hostile environment below the line, in comments compiled by my colleague Gerry Hart. You can share your own thoughts by commenting here. \u2018Everyone now assumes it\u2019s going to be a no-deal Brexit\u2019 I had an interesting chat yesterday with a big cheese from my chamber of commerce. Three things are worth reporting here. One, everyone now assumes it\u2019s going to be a no deal, except for things like air travel, security, and they\u2019ve planned for it. There\u2019s also much Brexit fatigue. Expect no rescue from these quarters. Two, folks here expect the pound to collapse badly, leading to loan defaults, personal bankruptcies and all kinds of woes among the local British expat community; some of that has already started, also confirmed by the head of my BNP Paribas branch yesterday. Three, Brexit politicians have been so awful that for many watchers, it has made [Emmanuel] Macron look so much better by contrast. All who have viewed a little or much of the UK political goings on have come out liking Macron and the EU more. Lupin813 \u2018No deal or no Brexit\u2019 The way the UK handled the negotiation process has been farcical. It has been a circus, and now either clown Boris or juggler Hunt will complete the chaotic catastrophe. The current and only choices are no deal or no Brexit. No deal is reckless insanity which will cripple the UK for decades and no Brexit is the only sane, rational choice. Gizzit \u2018Putin gave his seal of approval to Trump\u2019s actions\u2019 The article on Putin today made interesting reading. He gave his seal of approval to Trump\u2019s actions, the rise of the populist right in the west and claimed liberalism is dead. The way Britain is now slowly moving with Boris and Farage towards their model must make folk proud to be British. I wonder what our brave war dead would think of this after they gave their lives in defence of freedom. At least Donald Tusk again could be relied on to counter Putin\u2019s usual guff. newwavearmy \u2018The removal of illegal immigrants should be a result of processes followed where that is the consequence, rather than the objective\u2019 What happened in the Home Office is quite simple to understand. For the Home Office to function, the removal of illegal immigrants should be a result of processes followed where that is the consequence, rather than the objective. When you turn that around and say processes must lead to removal, the functionality of the department collapses. The person with the primary responsibility for that is Theresa May. kristinezkochanski On Donald Trump\u2019s ban on Huawei, Boris Johnson said: \u201cWe should not be doing anything to deter our most valuable intelligence partners. I really saw this as foreign secretary, it is a relationship we cannot afford to put at risk.\u201d He also said he was \u201cnot that attracted\u201d to lowering the voting age as we do not get enough 18- to 24-year-olds voting. The Labour MP David Lammy has tweeted about reports that Boris Johnson described the French as \u201cturds\u201d in a BBC documentary while he was foreign secretary. Johnson said he could not recall the remarks. Boris Johnson also distanced himself from offering a cabinet position to his leadership rival Jeremy Hunt if he becomes prime minister. \u201cI have a very high regard for Jeremy,\u201d he said, before being reminded by the host, Iain Dale, that it traditionally happens. Johnson added: \u201cI am not making commitments to anybody.\u201d Boris Johnson would not pledge to have a quota of 50% women in cabinet, but said he would \u201cbe advancing the interests of women in government and parliament like I did in City Hall\u201d. Boris Johnson also spoke about his proposal for a points-based immigration system. \u201cIf you look at the rural sector, there are farming communities that need seasonal labour. It has gone on for decades, if not centuries,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cThat\u2019s entirely right. But you should [do] it according to the needs of the economy and sector. What has gone on is no control at all. \u201cNo one knows on what basis they come in, the jobs to go to or what skill was required. A points-based approach is democratic consent to what is going on. A system that reflects the needs of the UK economy.\u201d Johnson added: \u201cI do think freedom of movement does not work. That was not working for us any more.\u201d Boris Johnson was asked why he ducked the Channel 4 and Sky News leadership debates. In response, he said: \u201cNo one could have done as many hustings as I have done. \u201cAs Conservatives, it\u2019s important not to tear great lumps out of each other. My policies have received a great deal of scrutiny. Thou shall not speak ill of another Conservative. I am doing at least two head-to-head debates \u2013 that is more than enough to glut the appetite.\u201d On Iran, Johnson said: \u201cWe need to very vigilant about Iran and that government. \u201cThey are bent on all sorts of mischief in the region. One of the areas that Donald Trump talks sense, and there are many areas, it is right to work with the Americans and European friends to constrain Iran in the region. \u201cThis is a young, dynamic population, high rates of female literacy, education, they are very tech-savvy. \u201cThey want to engage with us. We have to find ways of getting over the mullah\u2019s grip on society.\u201d Boris Johnson says stamp duty land tax in London is causing \u201chuge problems\u201d following reports he is considering abolishing the levy on homes worth less than \u00a3500,000 and reversing stamp duty increases on more expensive homes. On reports that he called the French \u201cturds\u201d in a BBC documentary aired last year that was cut, he responded: \u201cI have no recollection of this comment.\u201d In response to a question on whether milkshakes will be covered by the sugar tax, Johnson joked as to whether it was connected to them being thrown at politicians in recent months. \u201cThere is an obesity problem in this country. Something we all deal with and wrestle with,\u201d he said. \u201cNot eating is a very good solution, by the way. I am reluctant to impose new taxes that impose disproportionately those on low income. \u201cIf you want kids to lose weight, make the streets safe, like we did in London. Encourage kids to walk and cycle to school. It\u2019s calories in, calories out.\u201d Among the highlights of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech to Tory members was his pledge to exit the EU by 31 October. He also said \u201cisn\u2019t it time the A303 is modernised?\u201d and \u201ceducation funding needs to be levelled up\u201d across the country. Johnson added that it was an \u201cutter disgrace\u201d that parts of rural England do not have full-fibre broadband and are faced with the \u201crevolving pizza wheel of doom\u201d. Boris Johnson, referred to as \u201ccontestant number one\u201d by the host, Iain Dale, is on stage at the hustings in Exeter. He told the audience: \u201cI don\u2019t know of a time we got 9% in national election. The hour is darkest before the dawn. We can turn this thing around.\u201d Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Litvinenko, has told the Guardian she was disappointed that Theresa May had agreed to meet Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Osaka. She said the prime minster had failed to mention Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun \u2013 the two Russians accused of poisoning her husband in November 2006 with a radioactive cup of tea. Putin has refused to extradite the pair. A public inquiry in 2016 found them responsible for Litvinenko\u2019s murder. It concluded Russia\u2019s president had \u201cprobably\u201d approved the hit. Marina Litvinenko said: \u201cMrs May has said nothing about what happened to my husband. He was a British citizen when he died. The two suspects for his murder should be brought to justice.\u201d She added she was incensed by Putin\u2019s comments in his interview with the FT. \u201cPutin said we should forget what happened in Salisbury to the Skripals, that they weren\u2019t worth five kopecks. He didn\u2019t mention my husband,\u201d she said. \u201cLugovoi is now a deputy in Russia\u2019s duma. How the new prime minister handles relations with Moscow will be crucial. He may be tempted to start a new relationship without questions. I hope not.\u201d Marina Litvinenko was speaking at a Russian opposition conference organised by Free Russia in The Hague. Theresa May has told Vladimir Putin \u201cthere cannot be a normalisation of our bilateral relationship until Russia stops the irresponsible and destabilising activity\u201d, Downing Street has said, following her meeting with the Russian president at the G20 summit. Supporters of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are flanking the entrance to Sandy Park conference centre in Exeter ahead of the latest hustings. Jeremy Hunt has his say on Vladimir Putin\u2019s remarks that liberalism is \u201cobsolete\u201d. It comes as Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said he \u201dstrongly [disagreed]\u201d with the Russian president\u2019s sentiments. \u201cWhoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cWhat I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults and the rule of oligarchs, even if sometimes they may seem effective.\u201d The Home Office has been accused of being \u201creckless\u201d for failing to monitor the impact of its \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy, according to a leaked draft review into the Windrush scandal. Channel 4 News and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants obtained extracts from the review, which reportedly said the department \u201cfailed to monitor, or effectively evaluate, the effectiveness and impact of compliant environment measures\u201d. It added: \u201cThis appears particularly reckless considering the significant warnings that the department was given about their potential consequences.\u201d Wendy Williams, HM inspector of constabulary, who led the review, said there was a \u201cdefensive culture that results in an unwillingness to learn from past mistakes\u201d. She wrote: \u201cWhile everyone I spoke to was rightly appalled by what happened, this was often juxtaposed with a self-justification, either in the form of it was unforeseen, unforeseeable and therefore unavoidable \u2026 or a failure on the part of individuals to prove their status.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, called for an end to the hostile environment policy. \u201cThis damning review details the terrible experiences of many of the Windrush generation under the Tories\u2019 cruel and degrading hostile environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government is still failing to address the injustices they have caused: British citizens have lost their jobs, lost their homes and been deported.\u201d A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cWe do not comment on leaked documents.\u201d Boris Johnson is considering an emergency budget for a no-deal Brexit including tax cuts, an overhaul of stamp duty and an assault on regulation if he becomes prime minister, according to reports. Under the plan, the budget, which normally takes place in October or November, is likely to be brought forward to September, the Times reported. The proposals include an \u00a311bn-a-year proposal by Dominic Raab to increase the national insurance contribution threshold from \u00a38,632 to \u00a312,500. Johnson is also considering an overhaul of stamp duty. As well as abolishing the levy on homes worth less than \u00a3500,000, his team is considering reversing stamp duty increases on more expensive homes. At present, only the first \u00a3125,000 of a property is exempt from stamp duty. Other policies being considered include a \u201cTrump-style\u201d temporary prohibition on new regulations and raising the threshold for the annual investment allowance above the present level of \u00a31m to promote business. Johnson\u2019s team will discuss the plans next week at a meeting chaired by Sir Edward Lister. Three senior sources from the campaign told the newspaper that the ideas were under discussion. Ahead of the Tory leadership hustings today, Simon Jenkins believes Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will have to ditch a no-deal Brexit or face an election. Theresa May has begun her meeting with Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit. The pair shook hands but did not smile before sitting down to begin their talks in Osaka. Prior to the talks, May said Donald Trump\u2019s ban on Huawei could influence UK businesses\u2019 decisions about using the Chinese telecoms company\u2019s technology. A UK review of 5G supply chains will be published \u201cin due course\u201d, the prime minister said. The US has put Huawei on a so-called entity list, effectively banning US companies from selling components and technology to it. May said: \u201cThe decision by the United States for Huawei to be put on the entity list has obviously brought another factor into this issue and individual companies will be wanting to consider what the impact of that has.\u201d Labour MP Jess Phillips believes Jeremy Corbyn must withdraw the whip from Chris Williamson - the MP at the centre of an anti-Semitism row - as a \u201cmatter of principle\u201d. Ms Phillips is one of more than 120 MPs and peers calling for the removal of Mr Williamson from the parliamentary party following his readmission on Wednesday. The Derby North MP was originally suspended after saying the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in the face of criticism of the way it dealt with cases of anti-Semitism. Ms Phillips said Mr Williamson had been guilty of \u201ca litany of offensive behaviour towards the Jewish community and those fighting anti-Semitism\u201d. She told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThis is a matter of principle about racism, about the Labour Party being the party of equality, the party that is anti-racist. That reputation is slipping away from us every day.\u201d Our political editor Heather Stewart is in Japan for the G20 summit. Theresa May spoke to journalists at Yamamoto Noh Theatre and, in keeping with Japanese cultural traditions, the prime minister removed her shoes before entering the venue. Ahead of her meeting today with Vladmir Putin at the G20 summit in Osaka, Theresa May has called for the suspects in the Salisbury novichok attack to be \u201cbrought to justice\u201d. The UK believes two officers from Russia\u2019s military intelligence service were behind the poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in March 2018. Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service say there is sufficient evidence to charge two Russians \u2013 who go by the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov \u2013 for attempted murder. Skripal and his daughter survived the poisoning, but Dawn Sturgess died last July after coming into contact with the poison by handling a contaminated perfume bottle. May told the BBC that Russia needs to stop its \u201cdestabilising activities\u201d. In a separate interview with ITV, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s not business as usual and it can\u2019t be business as usual with Russia until they stop the sort of acts we have seen them doing around the world. \u201cI want to see the individuals, against whom charges have been brought, brought to justice.\u201d The Kremlin denies any involvement. Putin has insisted the suspects are civilians, not criminals. A crude remark by Boris Johnson about the French was cut from a BBC documentary following concerns at the Foreign Office over how it could affect diplomatic relations. The former foreign secretary accused the French of being \u201cturds\u201d over Brexit, with the comment due to appear in the Inside the Foreign Office programme in November, the Daily Mail reported. But the Foreign Office asked for it to be cut, with a Whitehall memo suggesting the comment would make Anglo-French relations \u201cawkward\u201d, according to the newspaper. A spokeswoman for the BBC said: \u201cThe programme set out to reflect the realities of life inside the Foreign Office, the production team made judgments about what was in the programme and they are satisfied that the programme achieves its ambitions and has the content they wanted.\u201d The Foreign Office declined to comment. Leadsom, who resigned from her post in May over Brexit, told the Today programme: \u201cBoris is the man who is going to take us out of the European Union. Only by being prepared to walk away will we get a good deal.\u201d She is also hopeful of a deal being struck before Halloween because of the incoming EU commissioners, \u201cwho would not want their legacy to be the United Kingdom being an unsolved mystery\u201d. Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the House of Commons, was pressed on the Today programme about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson had said the chances of no deal are \u201cmillion-to-one against\u201d, despite promising to leave on 31 October. During a lively interview with the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson, Leadsom said: \u201cI\u2019m not a bookie, I can\u2019t give you odds. \u201cIts impossible to predict the future. What Boris is indicating is it\u2019s not his intention to leave without a deal.\u201d Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live politics blog. We have a busy day ahead with Theresa May to meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Osaka \u2013 their first meeting since the poisonings in Salisbury last year \u2013 as well as updates on the Tory leadership hustings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
