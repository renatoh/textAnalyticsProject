Last October, the Treasury insisted on a review into the new Supporting People programme when its budget ballooned to \u00a31.8bn within months of its launch last April. The review will determine funding from next April onwards for a programme that helps a wide variety of clients, including rough sleepers and victims of domestic violence. The review itself was completed in December, and it is understood to have concluded that the current programme is too expensive. But since then the government has delayed the announcement of future funding to the councils that administer the programme. The delay is believed to have been caused by a row between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which is anxious to protect the current budget, and the Treasury, which is insisting on cuts. Officials had said that the new level of funding for the scheme would be announced by the end of January at the latest. The announcement is now not expected until next week at the earliest. The National Housing Federation has written to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister warning that any further delays could force providers to breach their legal obligations over the notice they give to tenants about changes in rent. It pointed out that as it stands, housing associations cannot give their supported housing tenants the required 28 days notice about the level of their rents from next April, because they don't know next year's funding levels. It is widely expected that the government will attempt to minimise the disruption to the programme next year by either freezing funding at current levels or allowing it to rise by inflation only. But it is also expected to insist on cuts in subsequent years. Many providers have vented their anxiety on the government website dedicated to the complex programme. Sue Witherspoon, director of strategy at English Churches Housing Group, said: \"We are drafting a budget on the basis of rumours about inflation, which is not a competent way to run an organisation.\" At least one local authority, Lancashire, has pre-empted the government's announcement by insisting that funding will be frozen from next April. This has alarmed Lancashire-based Paragon Care Group, which relies on Supporting People funding. Its development director, Daniel Jones, has written to local Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle explaining the issue. The letter says: \"Lancashire's Supporting People team, in response to ODPM hesitancy, stated they would be offering providers a 0% annual price increase in April, despite the RPI [inflation] figure averaging around 2.7%. \"This will put providers in a position of not being able to keep pace with wage rises nationally, which will again detract people from joining the support sector.\" It adds: \"Once again the financial impositions from government funding are making services more difficult to provide.\" Alan Haggar, head of the Supporting People team for Hampshire county council, said the government's lack of communication had been \"shocking\". He said: \"We haven't got the faintest idea what our budgets will be for next year. It makes planning impossible. The fact that we have to rely on your (SocietyGuardian.co.uk's) articles to find out what's going on is ridiculous when we have to manage this programme.\" The government's review examined allegations that councils are using the Supporting People programme to fund care services it was never intended to cover. But Mr Haggar said it was unfair to blame the council for a problem that had been created by the government. \"This is entirely a central government issue,\" he said. A spokeswoman for the ODPM apologised for the delay and pointed out that officials and ministers were well aware of the urgent need for the announcement to be made. She denied the departments were haggling over the size of the budget. \"We are working the Treasury to get the best offer for the long term stability of the programme,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
