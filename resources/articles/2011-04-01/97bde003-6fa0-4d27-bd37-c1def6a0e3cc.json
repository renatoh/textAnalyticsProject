The opening track's squawking seagulls set the tone and what follows is the band's best songwriting to date as they aim for a whimsical Devonshire equivalent of Californian, middle of the road pop that dominated the 70s. \"Some Written\" even has what sounds like an old-fashioned cinema organ, evoking cheap holidays, beach huts and saucy postcards rather than sand, surf and girls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
