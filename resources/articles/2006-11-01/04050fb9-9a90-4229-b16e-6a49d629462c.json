Vanska, now music director of the Minnesota Orchestra, returns to Glasgow to conduct one concert. The opening concert of the series, however, was placed in the hands of the orchestra's current chief conductor, Ilan Volkov. Given his predecessor's affinity for Sibelius, it's perhaps no surprise that Volkov's tenure with the BBCSSO has not been particularly associated with the composer's music. Tellingly, the works he chose to open the series were rather marginal: the enigmatic Fourth Symphony and the late symphonic poem Tapiola. On the evidence of this performance, Volkov is no great Sibelian. Two things are essential in a performance of the composer's music: the sense of overarching structure and of the distinctive, mysterious soundworld it inhabits. Volkov's Tapiola was neither mysterious nor particularly coherent. With little sense of ebb and flow, of one section surging into another, the piece became a series of unconnected units, with the imposing structural moments all but skated over, not helped by some ragged ensemble. The Fourth Symphony fared somewhat better, especially the almost Brucknerian third movement. But this was still surprisingly bland and ordinary Sibelius from a lacklustre BBCSSO, with little sense of the desolation and grandeur that a performance of the Fourth should reveal. The strongest performance of the concert was Bartok's Second Violin Concerto. With his technical command of the music, violinist Ilya Gringolts was a rock-solid soloist, underplaying the bold, swaggering aspects of the first movement for something more lyrical, but finding plenty of fire in the dancing finale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
