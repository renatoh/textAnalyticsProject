As part of the relaunch of the Labour leader as a politician who taps into public discontent with inequality, Corbyn will claim that he anticipated political shocks such as Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, and will say he stands for \u201ca complete break with this rigged system\u201d. In a key section of the speech on Saturday to the Fabian Society conference in London, Corbyn will castigate Theresa May over what he calls an NHS in the \u201cdanger zone\u201d and a care system that is letting down older people. A total of 380 care home businesses have been declared insolvent since 2010, Corbyn will say, according to excerpts of his speech released in advance. \u201cSo a Labour government would give social care the funding it needs and give a firm commitment to take failed private care homes into public ownership to maintain social care protection,\u201d the speech says. \u201cIt\u2019s the least we can do to guarantee dignity for people who\u2019ve given so much to our country.\u201d Much of the address is written in the more informal style of the Labour leader\u2019s recent relaunch by his team as a would-be populist, ideologically opposite to the likes of Nigel Farage and Donald Trump but using language that similarly lambasts a system supposedly fixed against ordinary people. The new style, announced before Christmas, had a rocky debut this week when a heralded change of approach on immigration was overshadowed by Corbyn\u2019s varying series of comments about the idea of a maximum wage cap. In Saturday\u2019s speech, Corbyn will say he anticipated the likes of Brexit and Trump\u2019s US election victory. \u201cLast year\u2019s global political earthquake didn\u2019t just come out of the blue. There are many of us who had felt the tremors growing for years,\u201d he will say. \u201cThe people who run Britain have been taking our country for a ride. They\u2019ve stitched up our political system to protect the powerful.\u201d Other elements of the speech rail against a \u201csystem [that] simply doesn\u2019t work for the vast majority\u201d. He will say of the government: \u201cThey\u2019ve rigged the economy and business rules to line the pockets of their friends. They\u2019ve slashed taxes on the richest \u2013 \u00a370bn from now till 2022 \u2013 and cut pay and vital services for the rest. \u201cThey\u2019ve sold off our country\u2019s assets and handed over public services to be milked by tax dodgers. They\u2019ve piled up debt while failing to invest in the jobs and industries of the future.\u201d Among a series of promises to create a fairer society, Corbyn will say: \u201cWe will provide a long-term funding solution to our most precious national treasure, our NHS. I don\u2019t keep talking about the NHS because it\u2019s in Labour\u2019s comfort zone. I talk about the National Health Service because it\u2019s in a danger zone.\u201d While the effectiveness of Corbyn\u2019s new style remains unproven, the Conservatives appear to have already made up their minds. On Friday evening the party sent out a fundraising appeal to members, saying the first week of the Corbyn relaunch had shown how \u201cout of touch, chaotic and incompetent\u201d Labour was under him. Speaking to Sky News on Friday, Corbyn said the departure of Tristram Hunt to run the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, soon after the loss of another MP, Jamie Reed, did not indicate that he was under internal pressure. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose MPs but he [Hunt] has taken this position as director of the V&amp;A \u2013 good luck to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t lost control of the party, the party isn\u2019t out of control. We are a very large party with a growing membership.\u201d Revised government data released late last month showed that the care home sector was facing worse troubles than previously believed. It gave the figure of 380 businesses declared insolvent since 2010, 98 more than the initial count. The data showed the rate of insolvencies had accelerated, going from 32 businesses in 2010 to 74 in 2015. These ranged in size from families running one care home to nationwide operators. The number of collapses is expected to increase further, with even big chains facing the pressure of lower council funding to pay for care. Four Seasons, the biggest care home operator in the country with more than 400 properties, recorded a pre-tax loss of \u00a3264m last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
