We were there to consider the best strategy to elect Tony as party leader, and what I remember most was Tony's assertion that the central factor in determining the outcome would be the attitude of the media. So the media had to be the target of his campaign. Today such an assertion would be obvious. Thirteen years ago, however, it was a relatively surprising idea. This core belief in the importance of media opinion, and the success of this approach in winning the 1997 election, became a dominating factor in the way in which a large part of government has operated over the last 10 years. The whole process has vastly increased the media's sense of its own importance and power. The last decade has been one of media pomp, in which the New Labour government has too often colluded. The practices which were necessary as we came to power have been extended and developed in ways which have ultimately damaged the political process and trust in politics and politicians. Media power has changed government policy on important matters of substance. I have no doubt that media attitudes and threats have been decisive in influencing British attitudes to the EU, in inhibiting reform in the criminal justice system, in influencing taxation and policies towards the media itself. But, just as many of us in politics look at the media world and urge you to understand its wider responsibility to society, we in politics have to do the same. Labour's greatest need, if we are to win the next general election, is to assess openly our successes and failures in government. I am certain that we will need to reinvent ourselves. We cannot say to the British people that a vote for Labour is simply a vote for more of the same. And there is no way to do that without talking openly about the issues. It is certainly right that there are divisions caused by those candidates for leader and deputy leader who have entered the contest before there's a vacancy, who have publicly appointed their campaign managers, and who prefer backroom conspiracy to open discussion of the policy challenges we face. These actions weaken the party. But they also undermine the authority of the prime minister when authority is important, as in relation to Iran today. These matters have to be dealt with by a strong prime minister. They cannot be addressed by a leader-in-waiting, and divisions in the ruling party do not help. I know the media loves the theatre, but that doesn't mean we have to give it to them. There is no \"broad consensus\" across the party about the leadership succession. The leadership is not a done deal to be delivered to a grateful nation. A genuine and open political contest may well be necessary. But the time and place to address that is on our terms and not the media's. It's when there's a vacancy and not before. The successor to New Labour cannot be a return to old Labour, as some so patently want and would so obviously lead to electoral defeat. But nor can it simply be a continuation of New Labour. New Labour has now become associated, fairly or unfairly, with a nexus of media-handling, perceived corruption, lack of openness, and self-absorption, which the public finds distasteful. The media agenda-setters see all these matters either in terms of some perpetual Blair/Brown feud, or in terms of a simple Labour leadership question. It's time for Labour politicians to stand up and address the only question which matters, both for us and the country: how can Labour win again? \u00b7 Charles Clarke is Labour MP for Norwich South and a former home secretary; this is an extract from a speech he gave last night to the Royal Television Society clarkec@parliament.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
