Donald Trump has been \u201cplaying a game\u201d for Easter, said Jimmy Kimmel from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018pin the tail on everyone else\u2019.\u201d The president is \u201cdesperate to shift blame for the fact that we were unprepared for this pandemic\u201d, Kimmel continued. On Wednesday, his scapegoat was the World Health Organization (WHO), which Trump claimed in a press conference \u201cminimized the threat of coronavirus\u201d. \u201cDid they minimize the threat? Because the person who said that this January looked an awful lot like you,\u201d Kimmel said, drawing up a clip of Trump telling CNBC on 22 January that he wasn\u2019t worried about coronavirus because \u201cwe have it totally under control\u201d. \u201cIn his defense, he\u2019s not too bright,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cSo now, they\u2019re trying to do damage control\u201d \u2013 earlier this week, the White House dispatched the US trade adviser Peter Navarro, who wrote a memo in January warning Trump of the coronavirus threat which he ignored, to praise the president on Fox News. \u201cWhere do they keep finding all these sycophantic old white guys?\u201d Kimmel wondered. \u201cDo they have a machine that makes them? Are they 3D-printing them somewhere in Idaho or something?\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cthe vice-poodle seems to be learning some Trumpy new tricks about self-promotion,\u201d said Kimmel, referring to Mike Pence office\u2019s refusal to let White House health experts appear on CNN unless the network promised to air the vice-president\u2019s non-expert comments. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we explain this to Mike Pence, but he isn\u2019t Batman. He\u2019s Robin,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cNobody cares about Robin. In the last 30 years they made nine Batman movies, Robin only got to be in two of them. So calm down, boy wonder. This is no way for the assistant commander of the space force to behave.\u201d Stephen Colbert A month into lockdown, Stephen Colbert was losing track of the days \u2013 swigging from a cocktail, reconfirming that it was indeed Thursday with his production team (his wife and son, off-camera), the Late Show host reflected that coming out of this, we may never be the same. \u201cOf course, all the experts agree that the only way out of this pandemic is to increase, in any way possible, widely available, reliable testing,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cSo, naturally, it was announced yesterday that the White House will end federal support for coronavirus testing sites on Friday. \u201cWhy is Trump opposed to the testing?\u201d Colbert fumed. \u201cSomeone tell him they\u2019re coronavirus tests, not paternity tests!\u201d Instead, the federal government will transition to state-managed testing sites as part of Trump\u2019s strategy to shift responsibility for the crisis to the states. \u201cOh, OK, if only there was some way to coordinate among the states,\u201d Colbert deadpanned, \u201csome way to, I don\u2019t know, unite the states of America under one government that had, let\u2019s say, an emergency management agency, but on a federal level. Heck of a job, Trumpy!\u201d Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also reacted to the news that the federal government will end funding for coronavirus testing sites this Friday, with some locations shutting down. \u201cYou think now is the time to cut off funding for tests? Are you insane?\u201d Meyers fumed. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting halfway through surgery, taking the guy\u2019s spleen out and saying: \u2018All right, you can wake him up. He can sew himself back together, that\u2019s the easy part.\u2019\u201d As of Thursday, roughly 17 million people had lost their jobs in three weeks, and the death toll surpassed 15,000 in the US. \u201cAnd yet, Trump is once again rushing to pretend this will all go away, and hoping people will forget that,\u201d said Meyers, pointing to Trump\u2019s comments in a press briefing and on Twitter that people should soon forget about the \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d and move on. \u201cThis bullshit is the same as people who act terribly and when you point out their terrible behavior cry, \u2018What of civility?\u2019\u201d Meyers continued. \u201cCivility isn\u2019t a right, it\u2019s earned! And sometimes people don\u2019t deserve, just like people don\u2019t deserve their bad decisions to be lost to history. And nothing gives away the game as to how badly Trump has handled this as Trump telling us now we have to forget about it when it\u2019s over.\u201d Trump has reversed course several times over the past couple weeks, such as when he visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 6 March and said he knew a lot about the virus because his uncle was a \u201csuper-genius\u201d professor. \u201cThat was the day that Trump said anyone who wants a test will get a test, and now, he\u2019s cutting funding for testing,\u201d Meyers explained. \u201cAnd I know he\u2019d prefer it if we were all Drew Barrymore from 50 First Dates and we\u2019d wake up each morning and say: \u2018President Trump? Huh, I\u2019ll give that a chance.\u2019 But that\u2019s not how most of our brains work. We remember the things we\u2019ve said and we hold you to account for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
