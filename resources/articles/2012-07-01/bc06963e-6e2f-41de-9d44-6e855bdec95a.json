Rumpled Boris, old Becks and a London bus, for heaven's sake? After the Great Wall of China, a hole in the road just north of Carnaby Street. Oh half-baked calamity! But such intimations of impending humiliation are banished now. There's no need to shower much more adulation on Danny Boyle and his 10,000 helpers. They're swimming in praise: for a quirky vision of what an Olympic opening might be; for bizarre laughs among the pomp; for their moments of history; meticulous organisation; and more joy than you can reasonably buy, even for \u00a327m. If Olympic openings in the modern era have two bases to cover \u2013 making the taxpayers of the host country proud and swaggering a little on the global stage as billions turn on their TVs \u2013 then the carnival that finished early yesterday morning on what used to be an industrial wasteland in nether Stratford did the complete job. The nation that gave the globe trooping the colour and Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals can still put on a memorable show. But is it sensible to look for much meaning beyond that, as we lollop along, double-dipping through recession? If Danny's revels are lauded for their self-deprecation, then surely, out there beyond the Olympic Park, there's a lot to be self-deprecating about? A few choruses of Hey Jude don't change anything. There will still be bills to pay and legacies to grow scratchy over when the athletes pack and go home. The show's the thing, to be sure, but it's also a suspension of reality. Yet, very gently and very, very cautiously, it is worth looking for some small shafts of substance amid the strobe lighting. Boyle's lore took in Shakespeare, Milton, Brunel and Tim Berners-Lee. It sought to sum up a country \u2013 a very multicultural land manifestly \u2013 which had played a full part in world literature, world construction, world invention (even if very few of those feats are taught in our core curriculum these days). It was anxious to show us, in short, that we'd mattered \u2013 and hint that we could perhaps matter again. It offered a fleeting feeling of national self-identity and self-worth as well as Mr Bean. How does all that sit alongside the familiar day-to-day tat of headlines and bulletins? The queues at Heathrow passport control, the mortification of G4S, the signal failures or threatened strikes on the Northern Line, the simmering anger of a de-industrialised north? Are we supposed to believe that Whitehall can get a grip on its computer programming because the Park unleashed a great cauldron of flames? That Walsall can become a second Westfield East? What if James Bond and not George Osborne were chancellor of the exchequer? The main thing is that nothing went wrong and everything important went right. The Britain of world-class architects designed and built a park that was finished ahead of time and inside budget. This is a Britain that still makes great things, not merely extracts great bank bonuses from murky manoeuvres along the digital highway. This Britain can employ and deploy the enthusiasm of thousands of young people when it chooses, can organise complex events in the most complex of cities and come up smiling. This Britain has rather more than petulance, regret and cynicism left in its locker. One river pageant can't sink its ambition. It will be easy over the course of the next few weeks to see such thinking slip away. There'll be dope scandals, rows, disappointments and possibly worse. There'll be bog-standard ordinary life, going on. The BBC's promise to cover every minute of the Games may come to seem more of a curse. The Olympics itself, swilling on cola, munching on burgers, speeding by in the fast lane, won't keep its sheen. And yet, from that opening ceremony, there will also be memories that last: the invocation to \"harmony, friendship and peace\" in sport; the beaming grins of athletes from Pacific atolls you'd never heard of; the enjoyment of one world of achievement brought together again. Sport has a special hold on the imagination. This is sport of the most special kind. We didn't drop the torch. We didn't foul up or shrink from the daring option. We put creativity first. Now, why on earth should all that go hang when it's all over?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
