Education secretary Michael Gove's outgoing adviser has come up with a candid assessment in which he argues that standards have stagnated for a generation, attacks the education establishment as being obsessed by the fear of elitism and, perhaps embarrassingly for his former master, suggests that the long-term goal of the Gove reforms is to leave the Department for Education (DfE) with almost no role other than to employ some accountants and inspectors. The radical ideas are set out in a 250-page paper dated late August and simply entitled: \"Some thoughts on education and political priorities.\" But whatever the title's modesty, there is little doubt that the document by an already controversial figure will cause anger among many in the educational establishment. Cummings' chief argument is that British education needs to do more to help the brightest pupils, even if this leads to greater inequality, and that teaching needs to concentrate on science and mathematics. \"There is a widespread dishonesty about standards in English schools and low aspiration,\" he claims, before complaining that there is \"a common view that only a small fraction of the population \u2026 should be given a reasonably advanced mathematical and scientific education\" while many other pupils leave school with little more than basic numeracy. Cummings takes a pessimistic view of what has been achieved by governments since the Margaret Thatcher era. \"At best, standards have stagnated over the last 30 years,\" he writes. \"There are fewer awful schools. But the sharp rise in GCSE results reflect easier exams, rather than real educational improvements and the skills expected of the top 20% of the ability range studying core A level subjects has significantly declined.\" Gove's adviser blames, in part, the mindset of many educationalists: \"Most people with power in the education system are more worried about being accused of elitism, and dividing children into sheep and goats, than they are about the problems caused by poor teaching, and they would rather than live with those problems than deal with those accusations. The block to higher performance is the management and quality of teaching in the school.\" There are cautious words about the academy schools, started by the Labour government but championed by Gove. Cummings says they may have produced better results but \"they are no panacea and the successes of a small number of brilliant organisations are not necessarily scaleable\". Revealingly, he suggests Whitehall has forced academies to use the examination system to show they are outperforming other schools: \"There is no doubt that many academies are badly run and may, like regular state schools, have gamed the league table system under huge pressure from Whitehall.\" The thesis defends free schools \u2013 currently the subject of fierce debate between the Conservatives and Labour \u2013 and says some are \"an inspiration\", citing the Greenwich free school, in south-east London, which teaches children from 8am to 5.30pm each day and offers Oxford-style subjects such as PPE, politics, philosophy and economics, from year 7. He warns: \"Some [free schools] will fail and have predictable disasters from disastrous teaching to financial fraud. Supporters of charters and academies need to focus on how to get a regulatory system that deals promptly with failure and allows successful organisations to expand.\" After two years in the heart of government, Cummings is brutal about the psychology of those who go into politics, even if he is likely to exclude his former boss Gove from his assessment. He claims: \"Many are dominated by the pursuit of prestige, refusal to admit errors and by a desire to react to media coverage which is much simpler than problem solving or management and provides a comforting illusion of activity.\" In a description that viewers of The Thick of It would recognise, Cummings describes the atmosphere of Westminster politics as \"constant panic, but little urgency. Almost everything takes months if not years longer than necessary. Many organisations cannot fill senior posts with people who can reliably spell and manage simple processes like answering correspondence.\" Ministers struggle to keep in control; some, he writes, \"have resorted to FOI-ing their own departments to get vital information\". Cummings also proposes that ministers should be given powers to fire civil servants. Choosing brutal, militaristic language, he says: \"The most important change in Whitehall is human resources rules. Until it is possible to replace people quickly in the same way that healthy armies fire bad generals \u2026 major improvements are impossible.\" Reducing the number of officials in the DfE had meant \"performance has increased as headcount has decreased. And I think it would improve further if there were a further large decrease in the headcount towards a DfE of hundreds and not thousands.\" There are harsh words for the nation as a whole; Cummings likens the UK to Apple in 1997 before its chief executive Steve Jobs returned. He said Britain was \"a once famous brand, now regarded as failing \u2013 no strategy, no focus, trying to do too far too much, massively complicated product lines, leading in little and dysfunctional decision making\". It is an argument based on the famous remark by the former US secretary of state, Dean Acheson that Britain, having lost an empire, had not found a role. Despite all the criticisms, he says Britain \"should be the school of the world\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
