On arriving at the start for the opening race, Fallon felt that Mr Ed, who started at 9-2, was lame and not fit to run. Goodwood vet Ed Lyall allowed the horse to take his chance, but supporters of the market leader knew their fate a long way out. Mr Ed, who won the same race 12 months ago, was never travelling well and was virtually pulled up by Fallon, finishing tailed off last. \"I am wild about the fact that he would not take my word as a professional that the horse was not fit to run,\" said Fallon. \"I believe that punters were done a disservice by the fact that the horse was allowed to go. To me it felt it was lame throughout the whole race.\" Lyall, defending his decision to allow Mr Ed to take part, said: \"I checked the horse at the start and in my opinion he was fine,\" he said. \"After the race I found that Mr Ed was perfectly all right.\" However, the Jockey Club vet at the track also examined Mr Ed after the race and found the chestnut to be slightly lame behind during routine testing. Stipendiary steward Paul Barton explained: \"As far as the stewards are concerned the gelding was sound enough and fit enough to start the race. Subsequent to the race, clearly there was something wrong with him. It's not entirely agreed what it is. A copy of our report on the inquiry will go back to Jockey Club headquarters at Portman Square.\" Gracefully, trained by Sylvester Kirk, won the day's feature race, the Group 3 Malaysia Airlines Prestige Stakes, to earn a quote of 20-1 from Coral for next year's 1,000 Guineas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
