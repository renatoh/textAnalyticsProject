The claim was denied categorically by sources at NM Rothschild, the Glazers' City advisers, but created a storm of interest on Manchester United fans' websites. Shareholders United itself offered a reward of \u00a3100 of United shares to the first of its members to find Joel Glazer, who is seen as the public face of the family's probable bid for the club. Under a picture of Joel, the website announced: \"Wanted: if you see this man, don't go near him . . . report him to the nearest group of Manchester United fans.\" Nick Towle, the chairman of Shareholders United, said the groups' intentions were entirely peaceful. \"If we can find his hotel, we will go round there with flags to protest. That is all we want to do.\" Many other internet comments were less measured and will inevitably provoke fears that anti-Glazer protests may not all be peaceful. Last month a group calling itself the Manchester Education Committee issued a statement saying it would \"ensure a warm welcome\" if any of the Glazers visited England \"no matter how large the phalanx of bodyguards\". If the Glazers have arrived, they have conducted an elaborate ruse to mislead the media. All indications have been that no discussions with United's board would take place until after Easter. Even then the initial contact was thought likely to be between Rothschild and Cazenove, United's City advisers. Brian Barwick will today urge his fellow Football Association board members to force through changes to the FA Cup to bring the final forward in order to give England a four-week break before the 2006 World Cup. There is a feeling within the FA that representatives of the top-flight clubs on the board have taken an inconsistent line on the issue. It is said that, having accepted the abolition next season of fifth- and sixth-round replays for clubs involved in European competition, certain individuals who also sit on the FA Challenge Cup committee then voted down the proposal when it passed to that body for ratification. \"The proposal on replays is endeavouring to meet the concerns of all sides and bring everyone together,\" said a source. \"But to say that it was the FA who wanted to get rid of the replays is too far-fetched. It was a suggestion of the Premier League clubs and now the Premier League wants replays. \"There is no question of going back on the May 13 Cup final date. Why can't the Premier League just play on August 1?\" Representatives of the Premier League contingent counter that it is the FA's competition and that it should move its own fixtures to accommodate the May 13 FA Cup final it wants. The Premier League initially objected to bringing the season forward and playing on August 1 because it is the gala opening date of the Football League. However, Championship clubs would not wish to be seen to be standing in the way of England's success. The Premier League has nevertheless ruled out an August 1 start because it says there will have been insufficient notice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
