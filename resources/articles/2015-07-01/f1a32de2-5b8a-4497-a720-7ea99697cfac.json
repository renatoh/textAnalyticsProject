The Nottingham duo\u2019s third cracker in three years finds producer Andrew Fearn\u2019s insistent beats and basslines again providing the perfect vehicle for Jason Williamson\u2019s furiously spluttered, sweary rhymes. His scattergun blunderbuss takes fire at anything and everything: his mates\u2019 music taste (\u201cPut the CD on. It\u2019s fucking Shakin\u2019 Stevens!\u201d), Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Tory cuts, bad dope, Starbucks, woolly jumpers, Lauren Laverne, Blur (\u201ceven the drummer\u2019s a fucking MP\u201d), gangs in leather jackets (\u201cmotorbikes from the 50s. You live in Carlton, you twat\u201d) to alienation itself (\u201cno one\u2019s bothered\u201d). Inspiration comes from all angles and a 1977 TV movie provides a title for the barmily brilliant Tarantula Deadly Cargo, a tale of spider transportation that morphs into a surreal examination of human excrement (\u201cEuropean poos are deadlier. Freeze it \u2026 you can eat it\u201d). Anger is still their foremost energy, but there is a much richer seam of humour than they like to let on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
