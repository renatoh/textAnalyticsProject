The Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia said: \u201cIn talks we had following the Europa League final, Maurizio made it clear how strongly he desired to return to his native country, explaining that his reasons for wanting to return to work in Italy were significant. \u201cHe also believed it important to be nearer his family, and for the well-being of his elderly parents he felt he needed to live closer to them at this point. Maurizio leaves Chelsea with thanks from us all for the work he and his assistants did.\u201d Practicality has driven Chelsea towards Lampard, who has legendary status in the eyes of their fans as the club\u2019s record goalscorer with 211 from 649 appearances over 13 years. They considered a move for Massimiliano Allegri only for the Italian to announce he would take a year out after leaving Juventus, and another possibility, Erik ten Hag, is expected to stay at Ajax. Lampard has come to tick a lot of boxes, not least the one about a willingness to promote academy products. He worked productively at Derby last season with Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori, who were on loan from Stamford Bridge, and it is likely the incoming Chelsea manager will also have to embrace talents such as Reece James and Tammy Abraham \u2013 together with Callum Hudson-Odoi when he recovers from achilles surgery \u2013 as the club faces a Fifa transfer ban. It was handed out in February for breaches of the rules regarding the registration of under-18 foreign players. Lampard\u2019s lack of experience is well-documented \u2013 last season was his first as a manager \u2013 and, in other circumstances, the Chelsea hierarchy might have preferred to wait for him. Yet they know how great his impact has been at Derby, particularly on the players, who admire his professionalism and enjoy working for him. He has transformed Derby\u2019s style and substantially reduced the average age of the team. It would be a blow for Derby to lose Lampard and they have made moves since their defeat by Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final to improve his contract. Equally, they know how difficult it would be for him to turn down Chelsea. Derby would be due around \u00a34m in compensation for the remaining two years on Lampard\u2019s deal. Lampard would want to bring his assistant, Jody Morris, to Stamford Bridge \u2013 Morris is a former Chelsea player and under-18s coach \u2013 and another club favourite, Petr Cech, is to be confirmed as the sporting director, a position that has needed to be filled since Michael Emenalo\u2019s departure. Chelsea have sold Eden Hazard to Real Madrid for an initial \u00a388.5m and they appear ready to begin serving their transfer ban this summer. Although they have appealed against the two-window sanction at the court of arbitration for sport, they have not asked for the punishment to be frozen pending the ruling. One of the requirements for a freeze is that a club shows urgency in demanding it \u2013 basically, when they take their case to Cas. Chelsea have not done so and, consequently, if they were to ask for one now, it would have less chance of being granted. Cas will not hear Chelsea\u2019s case until after 8 August, when the transfer window closes for Premier League clubs. Chelsea said they had terminated Sarri\u2019s contract with two years to run at the Italian\u2019s request and at the same time Juventus announced his arrival on a three-year deal. Sarri won the Europa League and finished third in the Premier League but his relationship with a vocal section of the Chelsea support broke down over concerns about the lack of drive in his team\u2019s style. He made it clear he wanted to return to Italy, partly for family reasons, and Juventus have agreed a compensation package with Chelsea that could be worth more than \u00a35m. Sarri\u2019s assistant Gianfranco Zola will also leave Chelsea. It is believed that Zola wants his next move to be into a manager\u2019s position, rather than another assistant\u2019s role."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
