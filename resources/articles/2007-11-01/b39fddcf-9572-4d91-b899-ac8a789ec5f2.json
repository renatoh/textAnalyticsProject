United Utilities will get \u00a31.78bn from the sale - \u00a31.14bn in cash and another \u00a3642m in debt, representing a 45% premium on its regulatory asset value. The company said it planned to hand \u00a31bn from the proceeds of the sale to shareholders in the next financial year. United Utilities was formed in 1995 through the merger of North West Water and Norweb. In June this year it said it wanted to sell the electricity distribution assets and earlier this week three groups - the JP Morgan/CBA consortium, Bahrain-based Arcapita and Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Infrastructure - were reported to have submitted final bids. \"This meets our target of agreeing the sale by the end of this calendar year and is consistent with our view that our shareholders' interests are best served by the much larger water asset base,\" United Utilities' chief executive, Philip Green, said yesterday. Though United Utilities is selling the electricity assets it said it had reached a \u00a31.5bn agreement to operate the business and to manage the capital expenditure programme until 2015, with the possibility of a five-year extension. Danny Latham, from Colonial First State Global Asset Management, CBA's asset management arm, said: \"The acquisition represents an attractive investment opportunity given its return profile and stable, sustainable cash flows.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
