As dull as it might seem, it's not so much a matter of 'don't forget your toothbrush' as 'don't forget your travel insurance'. According to recent research by the Post Office, 20 per cent of holidaymakers travel uninsured. And those who do take out insurance spend an average of 30 minutes or less researching a policy. Just as important as travelling insured is travelling with the right insurance. The Post Office found that 42 per cent of those surveyed had not read the small print of their policy. And while adequate medical cover remains a priority, medical claims account for just 30 per cent of all claims. The internet provides a remarkably quick and easy way to research and buy travel insurance. And buying the right policy on the internet is almost certainly substantially cheaper than buying through a travel agent. A recent survey from the Research Department found that a single-trip policy for a family of four travelling to Europe would cost \u00a392 with Thomas Cook for a minimum level of cover, and just over \u00a318 with TravelPlan Direct for comprehensive cover. Buying over the internet can be done in a matter of minutes by answering a few straightforward questions. You can pay instantly using a debit or credit card. You can usually reduce premiums by selecting to pay an increased excess, for example, or to opt out of personal belongings cover. For a single trip to Europe for a week for one adult, Cash found that TravelPlan Direct offered the cheapest cover at just \u00a36. It covers \u00a32m in medical expenses, \u00a320,000 personal accident, \u00a33,000 cancellation and \u00a31,500 personal belongings. For \u00a38.50 CostOut's Super Plus policy will cover \u00a310m in medical expenses and slightly more than TravelPlan for personal accident and personal effects. It can be cost effective to buy annual cover if you plan more than two trips abroad a year. Again, TravelPlan Direct came out cheapest for annual cover for a single person within Europe at \u00a329. JourneyWise's \u00a329.95 Super Cover gets you \u00a310m medical expenses, \u00a3100,000 personal accident, \u00a35,000 cancellation and \u00a32,000 personal belongings. There are lots of insurers who specialise in cover for gap-year backpackers, although these won't necessarily offer the best value. You can often reduce the price you pay by adding exclusions to the policy. For example, Travel Insurance Club charges \u00a3175 for a 12-month world trip. However, this excludes baggage cover. Adding \u00a31,000 of cover makes the premium \u00a3270. If you're going to work abroad or participate in any hazardous activities such as white-water rafting or scuba diving, check the policy offers cover. Club Direct has a very comprehensive website. A worldwide trip, including the USA and Canada, for 365 days costs \u00a3223.20. This includes cover for working abroad, loss of passport, loss of baggage, cancellation and \u00a310m in medical expenses. \u0095 Lisa Bachelor is editor of Guardian Unlimited's Money section."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
