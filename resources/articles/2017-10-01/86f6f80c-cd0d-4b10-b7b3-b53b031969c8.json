Serco, which posted a global \u00a382.1m ($139m) profit in 2016, is hosting a movie night at Acacia prison in Western Australia, as its sole contribution to national poverty week next week. Inmates are asked to make a gold coin donation to participate, because \u201cit is important for people who have committed crimes against society to have the opportunity to give something back\u201d. Serco said the event was the idea of inmates, and was being run by its non-government partner, rehabilitation provider Outcare. The company said the event was part of efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate prisoners through a \u201cresponsible prisoner\u201d model, which encourages inmates to make positive choices and plan their post-release future. \u201cThese events are chosen by prisoners themselves who, with our NGO partners, then plan, arrange and run the events. Our staff provide outstanding support and make their own contributions,\u201d a spokesman for the company said. But critics have criticised Serco\u2019s approach to national poverty week as a \u201ctone deaf, hypocritical exercise that does nothing to help people in real poverty\u201d. The Anti-Poverty Network of South Australia said most inmates were typically in poverty themselves. \u201cIt beggars belief that a multibillion-dollar company like Serco that has made its money from human rights abuses would think it appropriate to demand money from prisoners on anti-poverty week,\u201d its spokeswoman, Nijole Naujokas, said. \u201cMost prisoners are in poverty themselves and many times a lack of financial resources contributes to the decision to commit certain crimes and subsequent recidivism.\u201d The Acacia prison runs another charity program to support local groups, which relies on a prisoner-led reparation committee. This year, the committee identified homelessness, at-risk youth, and domestic violence as its areas of focus. It expects to make a $30,000 commitment of \u201cdirect sponsorship, time, and materials\u201d to six groups working in the area. Serco\u2019s operation of the Acacia facility was scrutinised late last year as part of a broader report by the state\u2019s inspector of custodial services, Neil Morgan. The prison held about 1,468 prisoners, but just 36.5% of beds were found to be compliant with Australasian guidelines, the report said. Double bunking had caused crowding in many units, the report said. Many services were found to be insufficient, including dental and mental health support and the access to the oval and gymnasium was restricted. Naujokas said Serco should spend more of its own money \u201cmaking prisoners lives and detention centres more comfortable, rather than cutting corners\u201d. Serco \u2013 a behemoth consultancy that provides a broad range of services for governments and corporations worldwide \u2013 found itself in the spotlight this week after the federal government announced it would help run Centrelink\u2019s troubled call centre. Under the deal 250 staff from a Serco subsidiary will join the call centre in a bid to improve performance and waiting times. Labor, the Greens, and the main public sector union all voiced opposition to the privatisation of a critical public service. Serco has run Australia\u2019s onshore immigration detention centres since 2009, and operates private prisons at Acacia, the Wandoo reintegration facility, and the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre. It is also part of a consortium that will build and operate a 1,700 bed prison near Grafton, in New South Wales, expected to be Australia\u2019s largest correctional centre. The Anti-Poverty Network is holding its conference next week, which it said was the only event of its kind organised by low-income people, for low-income people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
