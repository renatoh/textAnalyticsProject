And the new father was dreaming again yesterday after he had disposed of his long-time rival Patrick Rafter in his first round-robin match at the Tennis Masters Cup. \"I'm in a different chapter of my life now and I'm anxious to see how everything is going to develop for me,\" said the man who was presented with a son by Steffi Graf, now Mrs Agassi, just two weeks ago. \"I doubt I will be able to do this long enough for my boy to get to see me play but it sure is nice to dream a little bit about that. It's easy to think about.\" At 31, Agassi knows the clock is against him but he was able to slip back into the winning routine after recent domestic distractions and outplay Rafter, a man he finds easier to beat in Australia - the American won in the semi-final of the Australian Open last January - than at Wimbledon, where he has been humbled by the Queenslander in two consecutive semi-finals. Rafter has opted for rest and practice sessions to ease the strain on his chronically damaged shoulder these past two months and the rust showed as Agassi picked up weak volleys and passed him down the line, reeling off six straight games to win the first set. Urged on by a 10,000 crowd at the Olympic SuperDome, Rafter rallied briefly after going down a break early in the second set but was still well beaten, 6-2, 6-4 at the end. But the spectators rose to their feet when Agassi answered questions about his boy after the match and the new dad was touched. \"I have to say that of all the things you cherish in your life, the one you cherish most is your child and to have that kind of reaction to it did take me by surprise and made me feel pretty good.\" He will feel pretty good about his chances of challenging Gustavo Kuerten for the year-end No1 spot after this performance, too. It has given him a good platform in the round-robin format - two groups of four- in which the top two finishers move into knockout semi-finals on Saturday. Agassi now plays Lleyton Hewitt, the only other player who can usurp Kuerten's position, following Hewitt's typically feisty recovery to beat S\u00e9bastien Grosjean 3-6, 6-2, 6-3. Kuerten starts the defence of the title he won in Lisbon last year against Goran Ivanisevic tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
