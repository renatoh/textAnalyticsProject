The pairing was the string-orchestra version of Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht with the fifth concerto, the Emperor, and both performances were charged with a special, insistent urgency. Barenboim's approach to conducting has always owed much to Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, and this surging, sculpted performance of a work that Furtw\u00e4ngler did conduct, though apparently only in its original string sextet form, was a perfect example of that influence. The febrile intensity of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde seemed to be its starting point, but Barenboim ratcheted that up still further. The strings of the Berlin Staatskapelle are a wonderfully responsive unit, and with their eight double basses arrayed in a line across the back of the platform, the sound was all-enveloping, weighty yet buoyant. In the Emperor, too, the orchestral playing was exceptional, always alert and tinglingly vivid. Barenboim set off with tremendous elan in the opening piano solo, demonstrating that the occasional wrong note wasn't going to deter him from a performance of bristling immediacy. In fact, the splashes were more than occasional, but that hardly registered when the performance as a whole had such a sense of rightness and occasion, and when there were passages of such serene, silvered beauty to more than compensate for the untidy corners. Barenboim's Beethoven, warts and all, you sense, gets its priorities right. Final concert tonight. Box office: 0844 847 9934."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
