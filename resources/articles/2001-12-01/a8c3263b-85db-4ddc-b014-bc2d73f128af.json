The French striker claimed he reacted after being stamped on. \"We will wait to see what is the referee's report,\" said a Fulham spokesperson. Everton are to follow a similar course of action in respect of their defender David Weir, also dismissed after the clash which provoked a brawl involving most of the outfield players. They want the referee Phil Dowd, who was in charge of his first Premiership match, to look at the video of the incident which saw Weir, who reacted to Boa Morte's clattering challenge 15 minutes from time, receive a second yellow card. The Merseysiders are also worried that they could be hit by a charge of failing to control their players, which carries a \u00a3250,000 maximum fine. Everton's neighbours Liverpool have failed to have Dietmar Hamann's red card against Sunderland at Anfield last month overturned. The German international midfielder was sent off for a two-foot lunge on Bernt Haas. Fulham have described as \"pure fabrication\" reports linking them with moves for the Porto midfielder Deco and the Sporting Lisbon defender Cesar Luis Prates. Chelsea have denied reports linking the France international defender Marcel Desailly with a move to Manchester United. Sir Alex Ferguson has long been an admirer of the World Cup winner and may see him as an answer to the champions' growing defensive problems. Chelsea moreover may be tempted to sell Desailly, not only to help ease their financial problems but because John Terry and William Gallas have formed an impressive defensive partnership during the Frenchman's recent absence through injury. However, a Chelsea spokesperson said: \"Marcel Desailly is still a Chelsea player and the club has no knowledge of any impending move to Manchester United.\" Desailly was linked with a \u00a33m move to Old Trafford after reports that Ferguson and the United chief executive Peter Kenyon met the player and his agent Pape Diouf after Sunday's BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. Cardiff City's hopes of cashing in on their FA Cup third-round tie against Leeds United by playing it at the Millennium stadium have been thwarted by the FA. Replying to Cardiff's request to change venue, the FA insisted: \"Ties are only switched to alternative grounds for security and safety reasons and, as Ninian Park is able to stage this tie, then no change of venue is required.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
