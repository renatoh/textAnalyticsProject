The Symington family have a century of cricket behind them in the north-east, but the most famous day of all came yesterday as Marc Symington, a skiddy medium-pacer, took four wickets to dismiss the tourists for 169. Russel Arnold braved 11C temperatures with a hundred second time around to guard against a calamitous defeat, only a week before the opening Test at Lord's. Dav Whatmore, Sri Lanka's coach, admitted a 302-run first-innings deficit was \"a bit of a blip\" but described conditions as \"the most alien imaginable\". The England captain Nasser Hussain's attempt to play himself into form before next week's Test failed yesterday. He managed just four runs before becoming one of Greg Smith's five second-innings victims in Essex's Second Division encounter at Trent Bridge. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
