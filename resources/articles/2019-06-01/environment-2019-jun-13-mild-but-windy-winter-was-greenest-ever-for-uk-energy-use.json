The news on Thursday came as last winter was revealed to be the greenest yet for the country\u2019s energy system, after strong winds produced more renewable electricity and coal-fired power dwindled. SSE said Fiddler\u2019s Ferry near Warrington, Cheshire, the energy company\u2019s last remaining coal-fired power station, would close in March 2020, reducing the UK\u2019s coal-fired energy fleet to five plants. National Grid, the operator of the UK\u2019s electricity network, said mild temperatures combined with strong winds ensured the carbon intensity of Britain\u2019s electricity \u2013 the amount of carbon produced for every kilowatt of electricity \u2013 fell to an average of 242.8 grams of carbon between October and March, from 280.2 grams a year earlier. National Grid said the UK relied less on coal power plants over winter, partly because it was the fifth-warmest recorded in the past 59 years. The milder temperatures dampened energy demand, making it easier to avoid using coal in favour of running gas power plants, which produce half the carbon emissions. Meanwhile, stronger wind speeds helped drive down carbon emissions by spurring higher levels of low-carbon renewable electricity from windfarms. Elsewhere in the world, severe winters and hotter than normal summers have had the opposite effect, driving up energy demand to run heating and cooling systems, increasing global emissions. National Grid said the UK\u2019s carbon intensity was almost half the level of five years ago and was likely to fall further as coal plants shut down. The report emerged weeks after the country\u2019s energy system ran coal-free for more than a fortnight for the first time since the Industrial Revolution. Fintan Slye, the head of National Grid\u2019s system operator arm, said: \u201cMore renewable power generation and less coal is a trend that is here to stay, and this carbon intensity milestone shows the pace of change in the UK energy industry. \u201cWe believe that by 2025, we will be able to fully operate Great Britain\u2019s electricity system with zero carbon.\u201d Coal-fired power made up 5% of the UK\u2019s electricity over the winter and will be phased out altogether by 2025 under a government ban. Wind power and nuclear plants each made up 18% of the power generation mix, while gas-fired power plants produced 42%. Stephen Wheeler, the managing director of thermal energy at SSE, said Fiddler\u2019s Ferry could not compete with the economics of gas and renewable energy. He said SSE made the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d because the plant is losing \u00a340m a year, as government policy focuses on supporting less carbon-intensive forms of energy. \u201cFinancially, the station is making significant losses and our projections show that this will continue to be the case as the UK looks to phase out coal-fired generation by 2025 at the latest,\u201d he said. \u201cAt nearly 50 years old, the station is unable to compete with more efficient and modern gas and renewable generation.\u201d SSE\u2019s announcement follows EDF Energy\u2019s plan to close the Cottam coal plant in September, which it announced after a winter of record-low coal generation. Once Cottam and Fiddlers Ferry shut, the UK\u2019s remaining coal plants will be Aberthaw B in South Wales, West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
