You may be away from home for the first time and will never have had to handle your own finances. And the move from receiving pocket money to planning an increasingly complex budget is a big one. In the past, life at university was said to teach students all about thrift; these days it'll make you an expert in debt. Research shows that the average graduate will finish their degree owing \u00a312,000-\u00a315,000. Changes to funding In January 2003, the government published a white paper, the Future of Higher Education, that looked at ways of changing the way students finance their education. Students starting university from 2004 could be eligible for upfront grants of up to \u00a31,000 a year for poorer students. If your family earns less than \u00a310,000 you will get the full grant; if they earn less than \u00a320,000, you'll receive a smaller grant. If you are planning to start your course in September/October 2006 or later, you won't have to pay tuition fees until you've left university. You'll repay fees through taxes at a rate of 9% of income, on earnings of more than \u00a315,000 a year. The interest that you will pay on your outstanding and uncleared debt is 2.6%. The first \u00a31,100 of tuition fees will still be means-tested, so the poorest students will pay back a maximum of \u00a31,900 a year in fees (\u00a33,000 minus \u00a31,100) at current prices. Tuition Fees For now, though, as soon as your place at university is secured, you'll need to arrange tuition fees with your local education authority (LEA) - turning up to matriculation without a confirmation letter could mean paying fees at overseas student rates. The LEA will foot most of the bill, although it may require an annual contribution of up to \u00a31,125, depending on your family's income. For the academic year 2003/2004, if your parents' residual income is less than \u00a320,970, the contribution will be nothing; but if it is more than \u00a331,230, the full amount will be payable. If you have a disability, a dependant or are likely to incur high travel costs, you may be entitled to extra help. Start by filling in form HE1, which is available from your LEA (or online at www.dfes.gov.uk/studentsupport/formsandguides). The LEA will assess your eligibility and send form HE2. Once HE2 is returned, the authority decides fee payments and how much student loan you can receive (see below). Tuition fees are collected by the university, and most offer the option of paying in instalments through the year. Changing courses or repeating years may affect support from your LEA, and you will need to fill out a change of circumstances form. But in most cases, students have to pay their fees for each year, regardless of whether they complete it. In Scotland, there are no tuition fees for eligible Scottish and European Union students, but they have to repay a \u00a32,000 graduate endowment once they have left university and are earning more than \u00a310,000 (this will rise to \u00a315,000 for those starting repayments from April 2005). Other costs Food, accommodation, clothes and a social life will all add to your costs. Accommodation alone can cost \u00a32,686 a year, reckons the National Union of Students (NUS) in its most recent survey; \u00a33,433 if you're studying in London. Books can cost up to \u00a3252 a year; a year's food can amount to \u00a31,067, and if you're an average beer-drinker, the habit can cost \u00a3796 a year. Or more if you're above average . . . In total, the NUS estimates those at university in London spend \u00a38,374 during the academic year, whereas in other parts of the country the cost is \u00a37,011. Student loans Most students will have to borrow money to make it through their years of studying. The cheapest form of borrowing (unless you can persuade your parents to lend you the money at 0%) is through the Student Loans Company. The maximum loan for students in England and Wales during the 2003/2004 academic year will be \u00a34,000 if living away from home outside London, or \u00a34,930 if away from home and living in London. Those living at home will get up to \u00a33,165. All students are guaranteed at least 75% of these amounts. Your family's financial situation will determine how much more you will get. Loans are usually paid in three instalments throughout the year. Interest is limited to the rate of inflation and repayments begin the April after you leave, although if you're still earning less than \u00a310,000 a year (\u00a315,000 for those starting repayments from April 2005), they can be deferred longer. Annual repayments are 9% of earnings over the threshold - so an annual salary of \u00a311,000 currently means \u00a390 on loans. Some students who don't need loans take them out anyway and invest them, because the return is greater than the loan interest. However, a volatile stock market and relatively low bank interest rates mean the risk/reward balance is now far less attractive. The Student Loans Company is running a pilot for online applications with some LEAs in England. Enter your postcode at the student loans website (www.slc.co.uk) to find out if you live within a participating LEA. Banks Most students inevitably find themselves turning to banks. All the major banks offer student accounts, promising interest-free overdrafts, which can reach \u00a32,000 by your third year. Some banks recommend having student loans paid into a savings account, then transferring funds to current accounts every month. Additional services, such as cheap travel insurance, are often thrown in. However, much more important than a CD voucher or plastic wallet is the limit of the interest-free overdraft and the rates charged if you accidentally edge over it. Easy access to funds will also be important. That doesn't just mean proximity of cash machines and branches to the campus, but also what other channels are available to keep you abreast of your financial position. Most banks have an internet service to help you keep watch on your account 24 hours a day. Some operate phone systems where you can pay bills, make payments, switch money between accounts and check balances. It's very important that you keep in touch with your bank and don't bury your head in the sand if and when debts start to mount up. Most of the bigger banks have dedicated student advisers in branches near universities, and they can help to prevent your money problems spiralling out of control. Some high street banks offer cheap rates on insurance to cover things such as your hi-fi, computer or mobile phone in your university accommodation. But ask your parents to check their household insurance first, because some policies will already cover these possessions, and some can be extended to include them. Other sources of funding Most universities and student unions offer hardship funds. Contact your admissions tutor for details. If you're particularly bright, you may be able to get scholarships from a company or foundation (check www. scholarshipsearch.org.uk). Many students take part-time jobs to make ends meet. The student union is a good place to begin your search: they should understand coursework problems. Shifts in the union are also an excellent way of meeting people - you may even get free access to gigs and club nights. Income from work is taxable when it rises above \u00a34,615 a year. But in practice, most students never reach their tax-free ceiling and so don't have to worry about this. Final tips \u00b7 Don't wait until you get to university to open a bank account. Go to your local branch well before you head off. This removes delay and ensures you will get your student loan into your account as quickly as possible when you start your course. \u00b7 Try to work out how much you are going to need to live on each term. Then set yourself a budget and try to stick to it. \u00b7 Don't splash out on books and equipment until you get to college, even if they send you booklists in advance. Don't rush out and buy them all when you get there, either. Find out which ones you really require first. Many students end their courses with books they never opened. You can buy many of the ones you really need second-hand from second- or third-year students who have finished with them. \u00b7 Exercise some restraint. By forgoing just two pints of beer a week, for example, you will have \u00a320 a month more to spend on other things. \u00b7 Learn how to cook; it may be the most useful skill you pick up at university. \u00b7 Don't automatically apply for an overdraft the minute you open a student account. It's too tempting to go and blow it all in freshers' week.
