Now based in Brooklyn, his images have appeared in publications such as Life, the New Yorker and the New York Times magazine. Since 2015, he has been capturing his surroundings with various models of iPhone \u2013 \u201cnot necessarily the newest one\u201d \u2013 and posting them on Instagram. \u201cI have used Leicas and Canon SLR cameras for many decades,\u201d he says. \u201cThe transition from more conventional, very, very good cameras to smartphone cameras is a departure. It affects how you take pictures, how the camera is held, how you edit work, the immediacy of it. It\u2019s a tool that has enabled me to think differently and, at times, make a picture I didn\u2019t anticipate.\u201d This photograph, of a goldfish won as a prize at the amusement park on Coney Island, captures a busy summer evening in 2016. Along with 304 other images, it makes up Hardened, a new book edited by writer David Campany collecting Mermelstein\u2019s smartphone photography: grainy, slightly off-kilter images of strange encounters with the city\u2019s inhabitants. In the four decades he has been in New York, Mermelstein has returned time and time again to Coney Island to take photos. \u201cI like the quite extraordinary mixture of types of people: appearance-wise, clothing-wise or lack of clothing-wise. It\u2019s just a hodgepodge of characters, from the conventional to the bizarre.\u201d Hardened (\u00a355) by Jeff Mermelstein is published by M\u00f6rel Books on 4 November.
