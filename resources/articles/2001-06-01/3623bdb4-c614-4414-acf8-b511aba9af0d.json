As Downing Street fights off union demands for the government's growing dependence on the private sector to be watered down, the Blairite Institute for Public Policy Research calls for a \"rethink\" of flawed public private partnerships. It says hard lessons need to be learned from the government's much vaunted private finance initiative, the system for building new hospitals with private capital which is criticised as a Tory accounting trick. The report also questions the public private partnerships proposed for London Underground and air traffic control. Gavin Kelly, the institute's research director, said: \"Partnership has an important role to play but government needs to be willing to rethink when and how partnership is to be used and must avoid sending out the signal that only the private sector has the answers to the challenges facing public services.\" The report will be particularly irritating for the government because the recently appointed Treasury minister, Ruth Kelly, sat on the commission which drew up the 285-page report over two years. As the government braced itself for the publication of the report, the Treasury last night issued a statement saying that Ms Kelly, the economic secretary, fully supported government policy. But Ms Kelly put her name to a report which makes grim reading for the government. It endorses the Blairite \"third way\" philosophy, which says that there should be no ideological barriers to public pri vate partnerships (PPPs), by declaring there should be no \"no go\" areas for private companies. However, the report issues a stark warning that the government is in danger of going too far by adopting a \"public bad, private good\" view. \"There has been a tendency to spray the demand for 'private sector involvement' across most new government initiatives without proper consideration of what the different partners would have to offer,\" the report says. \"This has fuelled the partnership fatigue rather than unleashing new energy and innovation. \"The record of PFI has been patchy. The evidence from PFI projects suggests that although they may not be performing as poorly as some critics suggest, many offer at best marginal value-for-money gains without delivering the promised innovation in the design and organisation of services. \"The link made by government between PPPs and the part-privatisation of some public enterprises has also served to fuel suspicion among commentators that partnership and privatisation are one and the same thing and that partnership is a step towards full privatisation.\" To ensure PPPs provide better value, the report recommends an overhaul of the government's approach to working with the private sector, including stricter employment practices for private compa nies working in the public sector to prevent them making money by slashing workers' pay and conditions. The report will be seized on by union leaders and Labour traditionalists who are taking fright at the government's determination to press ahead with the privatisation of health and education provision. Lord Hattersley yesterday called on party members to rise up against Mr Blair's \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". Writing in the Observer, the former Labour deputy leader said: \"One by one the policies which define our philosophy have been rejected by the prime minister ... Believing that the party does not belong to Tony Blair we [should] rise up against the coup d'\u00e9tat which overthrew the legitimate philosophy.\" His remarks were seen as an appeal to Unison, Britain's largest trade union, which voted last week to review its multi-million support for the Labour party in the light of the prime minister's growing reliance on the private sector. John Monks, the normally mild-mannered TUC general secretary, who will speak at today's launch of the institute's report, warned that many unions were \"doubling their sentries\" because of worries over the government's admiration for the private sector. \"The impression that's been created by people somewhere near the middle of the government is that we want to put the gloves on and have a scrap,\" Mr Monks told GMTV. \"That is entirely the wrong way to start.\" But Alan Milburn, the health secretary, sought to calm fears about the government's plans. \"The core NHS principles are not up for sale,\" he said. \"Care will still be based on clinical need, not the ability to pay, and services will continue to be free at the point of use.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
