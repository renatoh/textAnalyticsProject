They are currently the greatest string quartet in the world, and their recordings of the Bartok and the Beethoven quartets for Decca remain the finest to have appeared on disc for many years. The first product of the group's new partnership is equally outstanding. Whether this is the beginning of a larger Schubert project, or just a one-off recording of the two best-known Schubert quartets, isn't clear. Let's hope it's the former, for in both works the players show an understanding of this very personal, expressive world that is natural and assured. There is no attempt to make the drama of the D minor, Death and the Maiden, larger than life. It is perfectly proportioned and poised on the cusp of classicism and romanticism, as is the melancholy of the A minor Quartet, with its second movement recycling music that was originally part of Schubert's Rosamunde. The recording quality is ideal - natural, never aggressive. This disc is a model for what chamber music should be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
