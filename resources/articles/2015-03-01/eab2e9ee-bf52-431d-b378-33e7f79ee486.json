Police chief Mike Koval, who has previously apologised to the Robinson family for the teenager\u2019s death and endorsed the rights of the thousands of protesters marching in Robinson\u2019s name, published the post through the department\u2019s official website, which also describes officer Kenny as \u201ca consummate professional and committed to selfless service\u201d. \u201cI have known officer Kenny for over twelve years, having served as one of the training staff when he was first commissioned,\u201d Koval writes. \u201cOfficer Kenny is a caring, conscientious individual who has a Bachelors Degree from Edgewood College and had a robust career as a medic in the Coast Guard.\u201d Koval goes on to note the officer has received 45 commendations or recognitions and was a keen first aider. A Guardian investigation reported a number of eyewitnesses saw officer Kenny\u2019s patrol car at the apartment where Robinson was shot without his rooftop siren lights on. An eyewitness described Kenny and another officer carrying Robinson\u2019s limp body out of the apartment \u201clike a piece of garbage\u201d. A friend of Robinson\u2019s, who the Guardian decided not to name, said the teenager had taken a large amount of magic mushrooms in the hours before his death. One of the 911 calls made to police before Robinson\u2019s death was from a friend who concerned because he was behaving erratically. He is alleged to have assaulted a pedestrian and was allegedly observed running in and out of traffic. Officer Kenny reportedly administered CPR on Robinson after the shots were fired. An initial autopsy indicates the teenager was shot in the head, the torso and the upper right extremity. The medical examiner did not disclose the number of shots fired. Koval writes in the blog that just as he is critical of media reports smearing Robinson over his criminal record, \u201cthe same outrage must be expressed for those who are judging officer Kenny on the basis of little more than headlines about the number of rounds, shot placement, and the fact he has used deadly force in the past (for which he was fully exonerated and recognized for his ability to place himself in harm\u2019s way).\u201d The incident is being investigated by the Wisconsin department of justice\u2019s division of criminal investigation. The findings of their review are expected to be delivered in the next few weeks. Koval\u2019s office did not respond to a request for further comment from the Guardian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
