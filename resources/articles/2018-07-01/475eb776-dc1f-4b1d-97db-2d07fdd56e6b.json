Edward Senior, 22, told teammates about a \u201cbrief relationship\u201d with a fellow student at Swansea University and they shared the messages on social media with hundreds of other students as a prank. University officials investigated the incident and then suspended Senior, which he feared would end his hopes of practising medicine. After returning to his family home in Raglan, Monmouthshire, he was found dead in woodland in February. Wendy James, the coroner, told the inquest at Newport, Gwent, that Senior\u2019s death highlighted the risks of putting \u201csensitive and private\u201d messages on the internet. \u201cHe made the post in a private form and that post was shared by friends with the consequences that he was excluded from the majority of lectures,\u201d she said. \u201cHe felt his future as a doctor was in jeopardy. He would have moved on and gone on to be a marvellous doctor and a credit to his friends and family.\u201d The inquest heard that a complaint was made about the social media post, the details of which were not disclosed, and the medical student was excluded from lectures and organising charity events. The coroner continued: \u201cThis had a profound effect on his wellbeing. He returned to the family home.\u201d He left a note, which indicated that he felt worried and alone after his exclusion. \u201cDespite having the support of a loving family, it was not enough for him to get through a stressful period in his life,\u201d the coroner said. \u201cNot knowing what the ramifications would be, he felt isolated and became overwhelmed. It is not unusual for young people to make mistakes. But his biggest mistake was dwelling on that one mistake.\u201d In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.
