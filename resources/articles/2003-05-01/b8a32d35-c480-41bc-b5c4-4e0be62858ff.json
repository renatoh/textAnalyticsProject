The Yorkshire pace bowler injured his abdomen during the championship match against Northamptonshire last week and missed Sunday's National League match. An ultrasound scan yesterday revealed that he had strained abdominal muscles in his left side. If he does not come through today's nets test satisfactorily he will not form part of an expected three-man pace attack with Steve Harmison and James Anderson. If Andy Flintoff has not recovered from his shoulder injury, and a spinner is omitted as often happens at Lord's, England may still opt for a four-prong seam attack with the Sussex bowler James Kirtley. A fast-bowling replacement may be sent for, possibly Worcestershire's Kabir Ali or Kent's Martin Saggers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
