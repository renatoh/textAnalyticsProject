She then met a woman and became very happy with her. There isn\u2019t one!\u201d Former children\u2019s laureate Jacqueline Wilson is rattling through the outline of her own autobiography \u2013 which she has no plans to write, although she did publish a \u201csimplified\u201d memoir for children, Jacky Daydream, in 2007. While her story \u2013 her rise from \u201cperfectly ordinary\u201d beginnings to become one of the most successful British children\u2019s authors \u2013 is well known, the last chapter may come as surprise to her legion of fans. Despite plans to visit her at home in Sussex, we are talking on the phone (Wilson is 74 and has had serious health problems) before the launch of her latest novel, Love Frankie, the release of a starry film of her 2012 novel Four Children and It, and cinema screenings of the hit stage production of her book Hetty Feather \u2013 \u201c a flurry of exciting things\u201d. With its sprinkling of stars and hearts, Love Frankie (her 111th book, if anyone is still counting), looks like any other teen romance, but the rainbow on the inside cover is a clue that this isn\u2019t the usual boy-meets-girl story. The middle one of three sisters, bookish tomboy Frankie is struggling to deal with her mum\u2019s MS diagnosis, their dad leaving them for \u201chorrible Helen\u201d, and the mean girls at school: so far, so Jacqueline Wilson. Then she falls for Sally, the prettiest, coolest girl in class. (And she just happens to be writing a dystopian story \u201cabout a devastating plague affecting the whole Earth\u201d.) While Wilson \u201cgenerally bristles\u201d at any suggestion that her novels are \u201cfull of issues\u201d, by her own admission, Love Frankie is \u201cjam-packed\u201d with them: a sick mum, separation, stepfamilies, sibling rivalry, bullying, falling in love \u2026 as Wilson says, \u201cit goes on and on\u201d. And then there\u2019s \u201cthe gay issue\u201d, which she has only glancingly approached before. Her books have proved surprisingly controversial over the years, but Love Frankie, into which she has \u201cput her heart and soul\u201d, is perhaps her bravest, at least in a personal sense. \u201cWell, I think so,\u201d she agrees, \u201cbecause I knew perfectly well that it would shine a little light on my own private life.\u201d For 18 years, Wilson has been living \u201cvery happily\u201d with her partner, Trish, a former bookseller, who she met at a party after the breakdown of her marriage in her early 50s. But she doesn\u2019t see this as her \u201ccoming-out novel\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been in any kind of closet,\u201d she says laughing. \u201cIt would be such old news for anybody that has ever known anything much about me. Even the vaguest acquaintance knows perfectly well that we are a couple.\u201d With her silver pixie crop, chunky silver rings (she used to buy one for every novel) and twinkly manner polished by years of public appearances, Wilson is the fairy goth-mother of children\u2019s fiction credited with daring to introduce such non-cheery subjects as depression and divorce into her children\u2019s bedrooms. But with her Blytonesque enthusiasm and fondness for pronouncing everything \u201cdelightful\u201d, Wilson seems the least devilish person you could meet. And despite her risky reputation, she is always at pains to stress that there are no sex or drugs in her fiction \u2013 \u201cnot at all!\u201d \u2013 with Love Frankie no exception (there is a punch bowl and there are a couple of kisses). For years, she received letters and emails from readers asking: \u201cWhy on earth do you never write a book about being gay?\u201d She would reply that because she usually wrote about children with problems, and didn\u2019t see \u201cany problem whatsoever with being gay\u201d, it didn\u2019t leave her with much of a plot \u2013 an answer that wouldn\u2019t satisfy most teenagers struggling with their sexuality. As she admits, \u201cadolescence is such a questioning time\u201d, when even wearing the wrong pair of jeans can make you feel like an outcast. So she set out to write \u201ca truthful, honest book about a girl falling in love with another girl. It\u2019s certainly not aimed at young gay teenagers, it\u2019s aimed at ALL teenagers who have ever worried because they haven\u2019t fallen in love, or they have fallen in love.\u201d In a culture that, as she observes, now almost demands that novelists have firsthand experience of what they write about, she hasn\u2019t felt any obligation to speak out as some sort of mentor. \u201cI don\u2019t think that girls would ever have wanted a grey-haired, wrinkly writer as a role model if they were wanting to feel good about maybe being gay,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m sure they could find much more glamorous examples.\u201d This is not the first time she has touched on the subject: her 2007 novel Kiss is a mirror-image of Love Frankie, in which Sylvie can\u2019t understand why Carl, her best friend and the boy next door, isn\u2019t interested in her, just as boy-next-door Sammy longs to be more than friends with Frankie. (Attentive older readers might also have wondered about Cam, Tracy Beaker\u2019s foster mother in the recent follow-up novel My Mum Tracy Beaker, who finds happiness with Tracy\u2019s teacher Mary, \u201cAnd why not!\u201d Wilson said at the time.) She agrees with the criticisms that children\u2019s books still have a long way to go in reflecting diversity in general. She has always imagined her best-loved character Tracy Beaker \u201cto be of dual heritage, because I\u2019d never ever mentioned her dad, who is long off the scene\u201d, although for many a millennial she will always be remembered as she was portrayed in the hugely popular 2002 CBBC TV series by Dani Harmer. Despite this, she feels publishing has a lot to learn from the increasingly colour-blind casting of television shows, including the recent adaptation of Katy, Wilson\u2019s retelling of Susan Coolidge\u2019s classic What Katy Did, which changed how she thought of her own characters. For the most part, Wilson has \u201cshied away\u201d from writing about being a teenager since her 1997-2002 quartet Girls in Love because adolescence has become an alien universe of selfies, clicks and likes. She doesn\u2019t even have a smartphone and now Frankie\u2019s older sister Zara dreams of being a YouTube sensation. Yet Wilson pulls it off, getting the details spot on, from texting (only your mum signs off \u201cLove Mum\u201d) to clothes (\u201cno one wears a dress!\u201d), insights she credits to \u201cthe little refresher course\u201d in teenage habits she gets with every school visit. Despite these reservations, she decided that falling in love, was \u201csuch an overwhelming\u201d and universal feeling that even social media didn\u2019t matter too much. \u201cI\u2019m a sort of sweet old-fashioned soul,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI\u2019m not into \u2018Who do you fancy?\u2019 or \u2018Are you going to have a quick bunk-up?\u2019 For me it is \u201cWho do you fall in love with?\u201d Growing up, the author, like many of her characters, was always \u201ca bit of an odd one out\u201d. She didn\u2019t have a crush on anyone of either sex: \u201cBut you just never know what is lurking inside you.\u201d As a novelist friend put it: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think you are a lesbian, I think you are a Trishian.\u2019 I think that really sums me up.\u201d Trish has been a lifesaver, almost literally, attempting to donate her kidney when Wilson needed a transplant. But it didn\u2019t work out. \u201cIt\u2019s funny we are compatible in every way apart from our blood type.\u201d Then, in what sounds like an adult version of a Wilson plot-line, they took part in an anonymous swapping scheme with another couple: her kidney type was the same as the donor\u2019s and Trish\u2019s was the same as their partner. They had to wait about a year before they got a good match. \u201cIt was so special to us and so private,\u201d she says. Wilson also suffered heart failure in 2008, and so while she can\u2019t manage marathon signing queues these days (one once lasted seven hours), she\u2019s almost as busy as ever. The only person who was \u201cappalled\u201d at her relationship with Trish was her mother. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too devastating for me because my mum cordially hated my ex-husband, she didn\u2019t really approve of any of my friends,\u201d Wilson laughs. She describes her mum as \u201can interesting woman\u201d, \u201ca forceful mother who thought she always knew best\u201d, but not a very maternal one. Yet one of the joys of a Wilson novel is the affection with which she captures the intimacy and intensity between mums and daughters. She adores her only daughter Emma, now an academic at Cambridge, who made her swear, when she was about nine, never to put her in any of her novels, a promise she has done her best to keep. Fathers don\u2019t get quite such a good write up and while there are a few good ones in Wilson\u2019s fiction they are undoubtedly outnumbered. \u201cI\u2019ve tried hard,\u201d she says laughing: \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 my experience of my own dad and my own ex-husband possibly has some effect. I will remedy this. It is very unfair. I have tried harder, but I just can\u2019t quite get there yet.\u201d Her endings are rarely straightforwardly happy, readers have complained when the parents don\u2019t get back together, and friendship is often rated more highly than romantic love. \u201cI can be a bit mean,\u201d she agrees. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m trying to show that there are different ways of being a happy family.\u201d Although her own badly matched parents stayed together (they wouldn\u2019t have done today, she says) hers was not a happy childhood, something she now sees as an advantage for an aspiring writer. She left home at 17 and the rest has become part of the Jacqueline Wilson legend: the job on Jackie Magazine (which may, or may not, have been named after her: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice story\u201d); the 40 books published in relative anonymity before bolshy Tracy Beaker changed her life. And now her own \u201calternative\u201d happy ending. Today she and Trish are holed up in their house in Sussex. Wilson, who had spent most of her life in Kingston upon Thames, was anxious about moving to the country, but when they discovered the house, with its expansive views and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, it seemed as if it \u201cwould be especially for us. And so far it has jolly well proved that. It is a delight.\u201d It is also home to her collections. She has a huge library and upstairs \u201ca most-eccentric room\u201d devoted to her collection of toys, including a rocking horse, and dolls. There\u2019s also a life-sized mannequin that she dresses up in different outfits. \u201cI hasten to add that I don\u2019t actually play with them,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not completely dotty!\u201d She was in London last month for a screening of Four Kids and It (released on Sky this weekend), rather surprisingly her first film. Always a childhood favourite, E Nesbit became an influence for the way in which her books were the first \u201cto change the more moral tone of the 19th century\u201d (she also bought silver jewellery each time she completed a novel). Updated \u201cwith my sort of children\u201d, Nesbit\u2019s 1902 fantasy Five Children and It is given the full Wilson treatment when a seemingly disastrous first holiday \u2013 for a \u201cjigsaw family\u201d of two divorced parents and their kids \u2013 is rescued by the appearance of a magical, grouchy Psammead (voiced by Michael Caine, \u201cwhich absolutely delights me\u201d) on a Cornish beach, who grants them wishes, from learning to fly to becoming a pop sensation (Cheryl Cole makes an appearance). Baddy Tristan is played \u201cwith immense style\u201d by Russell Brand. And keep your eyes peeled for a silver-haired woman in a book-signing queue as the opening credits roll. A film version of the hit West End production Hetty Feather (adapted by Emma Reeves, who won awards for the Tracy Beaker TV series), her hugely popular Victorian foundling, was also due to be screened in cinemas later this month. To keep to her regime of two books a year, she doesn\u2019t allow herself to get up before she\u2019s written at least 500 words. She has almost finished her next novel, \u201ca nice meaty historical book\u201d, set during the Great Exhibition with \u201cnothing controversial\u201d about it, or at least she doesn\u2019t think so. And despite the scariness of the outside world, she is \u201cperfectly happily settled in my ways and in old age\u201d, she says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve just been greedy. I\u2019ve had one kind of life, then I\u2019ve had another kind of life. This is just the way I am.\u201d \u2022 Love Frankie by Jacqueline Wilson will be published in August by Doubleday Childrens at \u00a312.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
