It also wants an inquiry into market arrangements in member states such as Spain that it believes may be \"distorting\" trade in liquefied natural gas at a time when Britain could be importing more than it is. Ofgem has also asked the energy infrastructure operator, National Grid, to give assurances that it is not preventing other potential importers from using its newly opened LNG terminal on the Isle of Grain in Kent. The watchdog said it was undertaking a number of initiatives although it accepted reassurances from the National Grid and others that there was no reason to presume that there would be an energy crisis this winter. The thrust of its inquiries to the EC surround \"why the interconnector [pipeline] has not been flowing at full capacity when UK gas prices are much higher than prices in Europe\". The price of gas has soared on the spot market from 30p per therm to 170p per therm, putting pressure on energy minister Malcolm Wicks and raising fears of power cuts for domestic consumers. The problems have also caused widespread panic among industrial users who fear things can only get worse. But on the eve of the CBI conference - a ferocious critic of the way the gas market is operating - Ofgem sought to defend itself by outlining a string of initiatives it is taking to improve the situation, while playing down the problems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
