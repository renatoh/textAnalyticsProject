As many watched Strictly Come Dancing on BBC1. But none could watch both, thanks to a scheduling clash. Of course, most fans can record one to watch later. But that is not the point. Strictly\u2026 and X Factor are part of an endangered breed these days: mass-audience, family-friendly, light entertainment. It is no exaggeration to say they are points of cultural communion in an otherwise atomised society; well, perhaps a slight exaggeration. But still, scheduling harmony would be in that spirit of mass participation. Viewers do not want their competitions to compete with each other. They do not want the clash. End this senseless ratings war!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
