The company says the three remaining mines at Selby have lost \u00a390m over the last three years and it cannot find a way to stem these losses. The decision is a blow to an already battered local economy. The National Union of Minerworkers said last night it had been invited to a meeting at the pits but refused to attend because there had been no consultation on Selby's future. The Coalfield Communities Campaign condemned the running down of the complex which is likely to start next year and be completed by 2004. \"We will be working with coalfield MPs and trade unions to see what we can do to reverse this appalling decision,\" said national chair Bill Flanagan. UK Coal declined to comment except to confirm it planned a statement and had invited the NUM to a meeting. It employs 2,000 at the Riccall, Stillingfleet and Wistow pits - but 3,000 further jobs rely on the mines. UK Coal, formerly RJB Mining, has long complained that poor geology and the falling price of coal on world markets have made Selby an albatross round its neck. The company that bought the majority of English pits on privatisation used to be popular in the City but shareholders have been urging it to dump less commercial mines and concentrate more on land development at its old sites. UK Coal will close the Prince of Wales mine in west Yorkshire next month while Clipstone colliery in Nottinghamshire will shut early next year. Steve Kemp, Yorkshire area secretary and national secretary-elect of the NUM, said it would be ludicrous to close Selby when there was coal under the ground to last for up to 40 years. Financial analysts say the company cannot afford to keep the facilities going now government subsidies have been gradually wound down. Coal mining was the country's largest employer in the early part of the 20th century but has been hit by foreign competition, the growth of new fuels such as gas and the declining power of the union after the 1980s miners' strike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
