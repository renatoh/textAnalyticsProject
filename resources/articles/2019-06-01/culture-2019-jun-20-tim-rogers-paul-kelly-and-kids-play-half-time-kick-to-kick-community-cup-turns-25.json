But for Millie Negro, just five in 1995, they were out of this world. As the footy players tore up the pitch at that early Community Cup match, she trailed around the strange ladies in awe. Negro has been attending the annual amateur charity match, beloved by Melburnians into music and Australian rules footy alike, since its inception in 1993. That\u2019s thanks to her dad, the musician and cartoonist Fred Negro, serving as the captain of the Espy Rockdogs for years. (It was a fitting appointment, given that he\u2019s been part of the fabric of legendary St Kilda rock venue the Esplanade Hotel for even longer.) In the cup\u2019s earliest incarnation, the Rockdogs were pitted against other Melbourne venues in a casual kick-about. Then in 1997 founder Jason Evans and James Young \u2013 now owner of Cherry Bar, then program manager at community radio station 3RRR \u2013 decided to form a larger music industry event for charity, which back then was St Kilda\u2019s Sacred Heart Mission. The Espy Rockdogs would be made up of musicians. A new team, the Megahertz, was put together of folk from 3RRR and another Melbourne community radio station, PBS. Ever since, it\u2019s been an annual highlight of any music and footy fan\u2019s social calendar. \u201cA stand-out moment was in 2010,\u201d says Negro. \u201cA few hairy, tatted-up, trucker-looking blokes in local bands, one being my godfather Phil Grinder [of punk rock band X], dressed as cheerleaders. They got up on stage while the Living End were playing and danced as go-go girls.\u201d Another year, Dan Sultan was captain of the Rockdogs. By then Negro was a young woman and had realised her childhood dream by joining the cheer squad. \u201cWe had a cheer that went, \u2018Dan, Dan, he\u2019s our man, if he can\u2019t do it, no one can,\u2019 \u201d she says. At the 25th Community Cup on 23 June, Sultan will be back, this time to perform with special guest Paul Kelly. Odds are the set will involve a cover of Kelly and Kev Carmody\u2019s From Little Things Big Things Grow, since that\u2019s the theme this year. Other sets will come from Magic Dirt, RVG, Harvey Sutherland and Baker Boy, and kids\u2019 entertainment from The Burnt Sausages. While the atmosphere is invariably raucous, Negro says it\u2019s always been a fun family outing. \u201cThere were loads of other kids to run around with,\u201d she says. \u201cAt half-time everyone was allowed on the field to kick footies with their friends and families after laughing at the traditional streaker.\u201d Actually that\u2019s a tradition lost since the event moved from Elsternwick to Abbotsford\u2019s Victoria Park in 2017. The local police north of the river weren\u2019t au fait with such hijinks and moved in to charge streakers with indecency. But despite morphing into a well-oiled machine, the Community Cup remains old school, something that music promoter James Young thinks holds huge appeal to those nostalgic for footy games of yore. He and his wife, Miranda, have been taking their kids Max, Archie and Somer (now 22, 20 and 18) since they were born. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to grassroots \u2013 football played on suburban grounds where you stand with a beer in your hand,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was heartbreaking when the AFL stopped letting kids on the field after the game. One of the great things about the Community Cup is they let the punters on the ground, not just after the game but in the breaks. My boys would have their hands on the fence just waiting for the final whistle so they could go and kick the ball. It\u2019s a great sound, 100 people kicking footballs at the same time.\u201d Over the years, Young has been a captain, coach and umpire, but now he\u2019s happy to be a punter. As he points out, the game has been reduced from 25-minute quarters to 15 minutes. \u201cThe game is almost the least interesting aspect,\u201d he says. \u201cOne year Spiderbait played at half-time. Kram had been playing for the Rockdogs, so he ran off the field and got behind the drums still wearing his footy boots.\u201d Tim Rogers, who\u2019s playing for the Rockdogs this year, doesn\u2019t agree that the footy takes second stage to the entertainment. \u201cThere are some incredibly skilled footballers, men and women, in both teams and I\u2019m agog at what they can do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a level playing field, so there are times when it\u2019s ugly and scrappy, and times when it\u2019s a beautiful game to watch. I like that mix; I think that\u2019s the way it should be. When it\u2019s all perfect and everyone\u2019s muscular, that just seems too much like CGI to me.\u201d Since the early 2000s, Tim Rogers has been a coach, player and umpire, before taking a hiatus in which he became more involved in the interstate events \u2013 Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Hobart and Brisbane have all hosted Community Cup events. \u201cI got the call-up to play again,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they wanted an elderly citizen as some kind of example of how to grow old disgracefully. I also wanted to play well for my dad because he\u2019s unwell and I thought it might give him a bit of a gee-up.\u201d Rogers\u2019 father was an umpire for what was then the Victorian Football Association, before the family moved to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, where he did the same for the Goldfields Football League. \u201cI used to follow him round every week and it\u2019s where I got my knowledge of bad language,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cMy dad was an excellent footy player, right up there skill-wise. As an umpire he was, for a big guy, very taciturn and measured, and I got a lot from the power of silence, so I\u2019m going to keep trying to learn from that.\u201d In 2018, 10,000 people attended the Community Cup, raising $170,000 for Reclink, a provider of sports and arts programs to disadvantaged Australians. It\u2019s a hands-on approach Rogers wholly approves of. \u201cIf people are in a bad way, just getting them part of a team, it\u2019s not necessarily a life changer but gee, it can get you in a much better frame of mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a living example of that. So I\u2019ll keep contributing. I\u2019ll make the sandwiches and Bovril next year, how about that?\u201d \u2022 The 25th Reclink Community Cup is on at Victoria Park in Abbotsford, Melbourne, on Sunday 23 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
