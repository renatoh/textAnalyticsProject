Underpinned by a famously forensic eye for detail, the Spaniard\u2019s aura of calm, good-natured authority is transforming Newcastle United to the point where supporters of Allardyce\u2019s Sunderland and Neil\u2019s Norwich City are becoming unsettled. By simply being himself, Ben\u00edtez has not only galvanised his own team but planted seeds of doubt in the minds of both rivals. A combination of the Spaniard\u2019s grace under pressure and Newcastle\u2019s best Premier League run since 2014 has fuelled real hope on Tyneside that a team one and two points, respectively, ahead of the other contenders for the last two relegation spots can stay out of the bottom three. Considering Norwich and Sunderland have a game in hand, the odds remain against St James\u2019 Park staging top-tier football next season but Ben\u00edtez retains the air of an experienced pilot quietly confident he can safely accomplish a high-risk landing on an icy runway buffeted by crosswinds. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100% in our hands,\u201d acknowledged Newcastle\u2019s manager, who knows he needs another win at Aston Villa on Saturday. \u201cBut we\u2019re going in the right direction, we\u2019re doing the right things, we\u2019re enjoying this challenge and we\u2019ll try and enjoy it until the end.\u201d The fragility of such pleasure was emphasised by the nervous undercurrents rippling through a capacity crowd before the excellent Andros Townsend sent a sublime free-kick curving into the top corner. Indeed the tension would surely have become unbearable had Karl Darlow not subsequently dived low to his left and saved a Yohan Cabaye penalty that threatened to offer Crystal Palace a point. It was typical of Ben\u00edtez that, when Rob Elliot ruptured his cruciate ligament and joined the similarly injured Tim Krul in the treatment room, he refused to panic, instead simply stating how lucky Newcastle were to have such a good third-choice goalkeeper. Judging by Darlow\u2019s occasional, generally unconvincing, appearances under previous managers it seemed wishful thinking but, instead, the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper has been little short of brilliant. Granted his positioning and footwork may be a bit unorthodox at times but he has pulled off a series of fabulous saves \u2013 on Saturday he repelled a difficult volley from Palace\u2019s dangerous Yannick Bolasie and an awkward Cabaye shot \u2013 as his team-mates have reacquainted themselves with the concept of hope. \u201cThis is a big three points for us,\u201d said Darlow, who was shocked to see the penalty awarded for what seemed a nonexistent handball against Moussa Sissoko. If it helped that Cabaye, widely booed by his once adoring former geordie public, struck his kick poorly, Darlow still performed heroics. \u201cI just picked the way to go, dived hard and reacted to the ball,\u201d he said, reflecting on a stop which could yet prove worth \u00a3100m to Newcastle. \u201cIt was possibly the most valuable save I\u2019ve made. It was one of those special moments that could keep us up. We do our research and look through everyone\u2019s penalties before we play them and Cabaye had put his last four or five the other way. So it was just instinct.\u201d Had fortune not frowned on Krul and Elliot, Darlow knows he would not even be warming the bench now so he appreciated it was imperative to take his unexpected chance. \u201cI never had any doubt I could play at this level,\u201d he said. \u201cI just needed an opportunity but now I have to help make sure we stay up.\u201d With Bolasie and Cabaye causing them all sorts of problems Newcastle did not start too well but, gradually, a series of players apparently reborn under Ben\u00edtez came to the fore. While Jamaal Lascelles highlighted his authority at centre-half with a fine, goal-preventing tackle on Connor Wickham, Cheik Tiot\u00e9 made some important interceptions and the impressive Jack Colback began really imposing himself on central midfield. When Townsend\u2019s magnificent free kick arced over the wall, safety felt within reach. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy game,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cWhen you see the size of Crystal Palace\u2019s players you realise that, physically, they\u2019re stronger than us so we couldn\u2019t win by just fighting. We had to play football and when we started to move the ball on the floor you could see the difference.\u201d It was all so absorbing that, rather than proving provocatively divisive, Alan Pardew\u2019s presence on his first return to the club since leaving for Palace seemed almost irrelevant. \u201cAlan was braced for a hostile one,\u201d said his assistant, Keith Millen. \u201cBut there was nothing. Newcastle fans realised they had bigger things to worry about.\u201d Man of the match Karl Darlow (Newcastle United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
