A group calling itself the Islamic Army had threatened to behead Angelo de la Cruz, a truck driver, unless Manila withdrew ... \"Ms Arroyo's decision may play well at home in the short term because Filipino involvement in Iraq was never all that popular to begin with, but it could have disastrous longer-term consequences for her government ... Spain and some Latin American countries had every right to exercise their sovereign judgment that it was best to leave Iraq. But their decisions, unlike Ms Arroyo's, were not driven by terrorist demands.\" Neal H Cruz Philippine Daily Enquirer, July 19 \"It is easy to say some other government should not knuckle under to terrorist threat when it is some stranger who is in danger ... It must have been very lonely up there as the president pondered on this quandary. She alone could decide whether Mr De la Cruz would live or die ... Not so long ago, we also called overseas Filipino workers, like Mr De la Cruz, heroes because they keep our ailing economy afloat ... Had the president allowed Mr De la Cruz to be beheaded, she would have sent the wrong signal ... Is that any way to treat heroes? ... Ms Arroyo just saved one and became one herself. Let's thank her, and God, for that.\" Manila Times Editorial, July 19 \"The Philippines has been thrust into the international limelight by its decision to save Mr De la Cruz even if it means dealing with the devil himself. The government has drawn sharp rebuke for making that decision from the White House, the [US] state department and the Australian government. This paper strongly believes the Arroyo government was wrong in capitulating to the demands of the terrorists holding Mr De la Cruz ... \"[American talkshow host Jay] Leno will not be the last to take potshots at the humanitarian mission's withdrawal from Iraq ... The [government] should learn not to be overly sensitive. It must not be distracted from the mission of the moment: Bringing home Mr De la Cruz alive.\" Christian Science Monitor Editorial, US, July 19 \"Ms Arroyo ... faced immense domestic pressure to save the hostage. The Philippines' first priority is the safety of millions of Filipinos working abroad, many in the Middle East. In addition, Ms Arroyo needs to shore up political support for making tough economic reforms after being recently re-elected by a slim margin. US ire at her shouldn't be too strong ... \"President George Bush's warning to other nations after September 11 that they are either 'with us or against us' in fighting terrorists has since become fuzzy ... The US cannot risk its overall security alliances in Asia and Europe by pushing too hard when an ally fails US expectations.\" Age Australia, July 19 \"By acting as it did the Philippines became the first foreign government to succumb to a terrorist injunction in Iraq ... The Philippine government has made a mistake not because it chose to withdraw its troops, which it is entitled to do, but because it withdrew them earlier than planned in response to bloody threats. The Philippine government's willingness to compromise may damage its relationship with the US and may also have consequences on its own soil ... The Arroyo government has now sent a message to the world that it is willing to acquiesce to violent blackmail.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
