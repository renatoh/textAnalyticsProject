A statement given to Reuters by the National Security Council spokesman, saying \u201cclearly right now is not the time\u201d for talks, following North Korea\u2019s test launch of a intercontinental ballistic missile last month. The statement seemed to close the door on a diplomatic window only hours after it had been opened by the administration\u2019s top diplomat. The mixed messages underlined the chaotic nature of Trump administration foreign policy, and raised new questions over how long Tillerson can stay in the administration that has persistently undercut him. On Tuesday, Tillerson told an audience of foreign policy experts in Washington: \u201cWe\u2019ve said from the diplomatic side we\u2019re ready to talk any time North Korea, would like to talk, and we\u2019re ready to have the first meeting without precondition.\u201d In the most direct overture to Pyongyang to date, the secretary of state said: \u201cLet\u2019s just meet, and we can talk about the weather if you want. We can talk about whether it\u2019s going to be a square table or a round table, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re excited about. But can we at least sit down and see each other face to face?\u201d The one condition Tillerson laid down was that there had to be a pause in North Korean nuclear and missile tests, but he presented that as a practical consideration rather than a demand for a concession from Pyongyang on a matter of principle. The tone of Tillerson\u2019s comments marked a clear break from the state department formula before Tuesday that North Korea would have to show it was \u201cserious about denuclearization\u201d before contact could start. US officials had said that meant North Korea would have to commit to putting its nuclear weapons programme on the table in any eventual substantive negotiations. The state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert insisted on Wednesday \u201cthe secretary is on the same page as the White House\u201d and said repeatedly that \u201cthe policy has not changed\u201d. However, it was not clear how Tillerson\u2019s presentation on Tuesday was compatible with either the White House statement or previous state department descriptions of policy. Adding to confusion, Nauert appeared to reintroduce the precondition that Pyongyang had to be ready eventually to disarm. \u201cWe remain open to dialogue when North Korea is willing to conduct a credible dialogue on the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not seeing any evidence that they are ready to sit down and have those kind of conversations right now.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s remarks followed a trip to Pyongyang by the UN\u2019s under-secretary general for political affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, a former US diplomat. During the visit, the first by such a high-ranking UN official for six years, Feltman met the foreign minister Ri Yong-ho, and warned that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d in establishing a dialogue. Feltman also noted \u201cthe urgent need to prevent miscalculations and open channels to reduce the risks of conflict\u201d, an apparent reference to a proposal to set up a military-to-military channel as a first step in resuming a dialogue, and lessening the risk of an accidental encounter between the two sides escalating into full-scale war. Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior director at the New America thinktank and a leading participant in back-channel contacts with North Korea, said that both sides felt they were in a position of strength, after North Korea\u2019s successful tests of a powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November and an apparent hydrogen bomb in September, while the US had marshaled a global consensus behind new economic pressure on Pyongyang. Commenting on Tillerson\u2019s statement, DiMaggio said: \u201cIt looks like there is recognition inside the administration that a big effort is needed to avoid a catastrophic confrontation.\u201d But she warned that for the opportunity for dialogue not to be lost, \u201cit\u2019s more important than ever that the administration speak with one voice\u201d. Commenting on the mixed messages, Vipin Narang, an expert on the North Korean nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, tweeted: \u201cAmbiguity can enhance deterrence, confusion can kill it. This is confusion.\u201d This is not the first time the White House has contradicted Rex Tillerson on policy towards North Korea. In early October, when Tillerson was visiting China and raised the possibility of contacts with North Korea, Trump tweeted that he had told his secretary of state to \u201csave his energy\u201d. At the end of November, Tillerson had to fight off anonymous briefings from the White House that he was about to be fired and replaced by the CIA director, Mike Pompeo. In laying out the case for talks on Tuesday, Tillerson said that an initial dialogue would serve to learn more about Kim. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a new leader in North Korea that no one\u2019s ever engaged with,\u201d he said at a meeting organised by the Atlantic Council thinktank. \u201cAnd he clearly is not like his father, nor is he like his grandfather, and we don\u2019t know a whole lot about what it will be like to engage with him. I have to know who my counterpart is. I have to know something about them.\u201d Kim has staked his credibility within the regime on the success of the nuclear weapons programme, and congratulated his country\u2019s scientists on Tuesday who he said had \u201csuccessfully carried out the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force\u201d, echoing the language of an earlier official statement suggesting the regime believes it has achieved its aim of developing the capacity to carry out a nuclear strike on the US mainland. But the North Korean dictator said scientists and workers would continue manufacturing \u201cmore latest weapons and equipment\u201d to \u201cbolster up the nuclear force in quality and quantity\u201d, according to the state news agency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
