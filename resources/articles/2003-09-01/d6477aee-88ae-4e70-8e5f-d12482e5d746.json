According to a source close to the bidding, the company withdrew after a bust-up over NHS plans to impose swingeing fines should its equipment and software fail to meet stringent performance targets. Neither EDS, which is usually a major supplier to Whitehall departments, nor the NHS would comment yesterday. But the firm's eleventh-hour decision reflects a growing row between the Government and IT contractors, which could derail the huge scheme to overhaul the NHS computer system just months before it is due to start. Last month The Observer revealed that Lockheed Martin had also pulled out in protest at the proposed penalty regime. EDS's withdrawal is not yet so serious, since it is only partial: the company has abandoned its bid for a \u00a3150 million deal to manage the NHS's appointment booking system, but remains in the running for two larger contracts. The public-private IT contracts, worth \u00a310 billion in total, are a central plank of the Government's drive to make the health service more consumer-focused. Whitehall's insistence on penalties is thought to have been prompted by a number of recent IT fiascos - including the breakdown of the Inland Revenue's tax credits system this summer, for which EDS was widely criticised. Other firms bidding for NHS contracts include IBM, Accenture, Fujitsu and Schlumberger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
