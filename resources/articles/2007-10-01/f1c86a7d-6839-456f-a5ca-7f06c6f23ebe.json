Here was a very quiet, shy lad, not saying much for himself. He's changed now, off the field. He's turned out to be a character who knows what he wants in life. He's intensely motivated, very clear in what he's doing. The biggest thing that Jonny brings to a side is his aura. He seems to breed so much confidence in the players around him. You have a guy at the top of his game, performing well on the ground, running the game, placing you in the right territorial areas of the pitch, kicking to the corners if the wing isn't back. On top of that you have his defensive ability. I don't think people understand the way he has worked to perfect the art of tackling. Pound for pound he is one of the biggest tacklers in the world. Most fly-halves shy away from it a little but Jonny has always been the first to step up and put in the big hit. If the fly-half is able to put in the tackles that gives a lot of confidence to the backs. They don't have to step in to help, which can create an overlap for the opposition. And, whatever his figures in this tournament, his place-kicking ability is still there. I don't believe his stats are over 70%, which is not what you would expect of a world-class goal-kicker, but in this World Cup when the kicks have mattered he has delivered. The flipside of that is that the opposition become so wary of his capability. There is a feeling of inevitability about it, the fact that the slightest mistake in their own half is going to be dangerous. When confidence is low, that's when someone like that is critical. England had a phase like that during this tournament and there was clearly a big blow-out meeting the Saturday after the South Africa defeat. In the end they had the result they wanted. What you get in that situation is a meeting of minds among the guys who run the game, the No8, the half-backs, inside-centre, the guys at the heart of the battle. Jonny's return to form has had a massively positive effect because, if the team know how they want to play the game, everyone has to know that the guys in the pivotal roles know what they are doing and will stick to it. Then everyone knows where to be and can conform to the team's pattern of play. That in turn breeds confidence because you end up getting numbers to key areas. The forwards run to those areas instinctively, they get there quicker than the defence, they overpower the opposition. The next group of forwards get 20 metres beyond that breakdown, so you are constantly breaking the gain-line, getting the opportunity to attack a disorganised, broken defence. It's said that Jonny has pushed his body too hard but I'd reply: can you ever push your body too hard? He's been really unfortunate in the injuries he's picked up; in one at least he was taken out by someone else making a tackle. In a situation where there are legs flying you can catch a hit that makes your body go in a direction it doesn't expect to go. If he's full on for a tackle, he'll be aware of what's coming and his body will be braced for it. In the 2003 World Cup I remember him feeling as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He struggled early on with the pressure that was heaped on the team. Most rugby players have a self-critical element. If you want to push yourself, you need to be aware of your strengths and weaknesses, what improvements need to take place. Jonny goes that little bit further, although the majority of good goal-kickers spend a lot of unseen time getting into their rhythm. A lot has been said about the match balls but I guess that it's true: if the pressure, dimension or weight of the ball changes, he can feel it. On the Lions' tour in 2001, on the day off before a game, usually a Thursday, the two of us would make a point of going and finding a new town, popping out, having a walk and a hot chocolate or something, just to get away from the hotel. Jonny has his own individual humour, very dry. It was a big thing for us, just having that ability to get away from a rugby environment, which I think is what he strives for more than anything else. In the early days Mike Catt, me and Jonny used to have a competition: whoever got recognised the most had to buy the coffees. Usually Cattie ended up buying because he counted drivers giving him the thumbs up. I don't think it would be that way now if the three of us were on a street together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
