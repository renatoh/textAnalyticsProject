A leading copyright lawyer has suggested the federal government could buy the rights from Harold Thomas so the design could be made public. The former CEO of the Australian Copyright Council, Fiona Phillips, said the legal status of the Aboriginal flag was a \u201cunique situation\u201d that required a public policy solution. \u201cThe Aboriginal flag is not just an artistic work, it\u2019s a national symbol and is particularly important to Indigenous Australians,\u201d said Phillips, who has also worked at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and as a government adviser on copyright law. A spokesperson for Wam Clothing, which has worldwide exclusive rights to reproduce the flag on clothing, said it welcomed anyone, \u201cincluding the government, to contact us with respect to the use of the Aboriginal flag under our licence\u201d. Copyright of the flag rests with its designer, Luritja artist Harold Thomas, after the federal court found he was the sole copyright owner in 1997. Thomas entered into a number of licensing arrangements over the years, most recently with the non-Indigenous-owned company Wam Clothing in November 2018. Last week Wam Clothing sent notice to at least one company, the Aboriginal-owned social enterprise Spark Health, to stop producing clothing featuring the design. Spark Health produced a range called \u201cClothing the gap\u201d, the profits from which go towards Aboriginal health education programs. Spark Health said it was currently seeking legal advice. Wam Clothing is part-owned by Queensland businessman Ben Wooster, who has had a long association with Harold Thomas, as a licensee of the flag. A spokesperson for Wam Clothing said the company \u201chas a strong desire to promote the Aboriginal flag in a positive light\u201d, and \u201chas been actively inviting any organisations, manufacturers and sellers who wish to use the Aboriginal flag on clothing to contact us and discuss their options\u201d. Wooster was sole owner of Birubi Art, a now-defunct company found by the federal court to have \u201cmade false or misleading representations that products it sold were made in Australia and hand-painted by Australian Aboriginal persons, in breach of the Australian consumer law\u201d. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is seeking a $2m to $2.5m penalty against Birubi Art, to signify the \u201cserious cultural harm\u201d done by fake Aboriginal art. These harms were \u201cgrave and far-reaching\u201d and involved \u201cnot just direct economic loss but a weakening of the value of the authentic products\u201d and an \u201cerosion of consumer confidence in the entire sector\u201d, the ACCC told the court. Katter acknowledged the problems arising from ownership by the government and suggested the rights be handed to a respected body. He also said a legal situation should be avoided where anyone at all could use the flag. \u201cI specifically reference one example where the Aboriginal flag was used in a nefarious way by an American racist organisation that had branches in Australia,\u201d Katter\u2019s statement said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
