Fenway Sports Group, the club's owners, spent a further \u00a357.8m in January to sign Andy Carroll and Luis Su\u00e1rez from Newcastle United and Ajax respectively, although that figure was offset by the \u00a356m raised through the sales of Fernando Torres and Ryan Babel. Despite the prospect of another season apart from the European elite, Comolli believes the club's profile and the ambition of Fenway Sports Group will produce substantial investment this summer. Liverpool's director of football said: \"There will be movement, that's for sure. We are very attractive for a lot of players because of what we did in January and a game like that [the 3-1 defeat of Manchester United] is fantastic publicity for us around the world. Since the day after I was getting phone calls from agents telling me that their player would love to come and that we are going to compete next year if we get it right. We are attractive to a lot of top players and we want to bring top players to this club.\" Henry, who has declared that Liverpool will win their first league title since 1990 under the ownership of the Fenway Sports Group, has described the disparity between the club's wage bill and strength in depth as the worst surprise of his six-month tenure. Liverpool are facing a second successive season outside the Champions League, and possibly even the Europa League next term, and Henry believes he inherited a squad that did not justify the club's expenditure. Liverpool joined Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal as the only clubs in English football history to spend over \u00a3100m on wages in 2008-09, although they have since been joined by Manchester City among the highest payers in the Premier League. \"The worst surprise [upon takeover] was the lack of depth in the squad,\" said Henry. \"Our biggest concern in taking on this responsibility was this issue and it was a bigger issue than we feared. There was a huge multi-year payroll for a squad that had very little quality depth.\" Henry, speaking to Four Four Two magazine, insisted FSG would help end Liverpool's 21-year wait for a 19th league title. He added: \"Our No1 priority is to win the Premier League title. That is what we take with us each day to work as the force that drives us to excel. If we can accomplish that we will have put ourselves in a position to be successful on all fronts including Europe. Success is winning championships. It is nothing less than that. And when you win a championship \u2013 and we will \u2013 success isn't measured or accomplished by winning once.\" Kenny Dalglish, meanwhile, has brought the academy youngsters John Flanagan and Jack Robinson into the first-team squad at Melwood as he deals with a defensive injury crisis that could leave him without Glen Johnson, Daniel Agger and Martin Kelly for Monday's visit of Manchester City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
