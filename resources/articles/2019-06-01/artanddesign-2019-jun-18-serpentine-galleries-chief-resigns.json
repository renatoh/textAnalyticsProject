On Tuesday, Yana Peel announced she was stepping down as the chief executive of the prestigious London art gallery so the work of the Serpentine would not be undermined by what she called \u201cmisguided personal attacks on me and my family\u201d. In a statement, Peel said: \u201cI have decided I am better able to continue my work in supporting the arts, the advancement of human rights and freedom of expression by moving away from my current role.\u201d Last week, the Guardian revealed the Peel\u2019s family\u2019s links to Novalpina Capital, a private equity firm that in turn controls a majority stake in NSO Group, a $1bn (\u00a3790m) Israeli technology firm, according to corporate records in the US and Luxembourg. Novalpina was co-founded by Peel\u2019s husband, Stephen. Novalpina took a majority of NSO shares, and NSO\u2019s Israeli founders hold a minority stake. Human rights groups, activists and surveillance experts have accused NSO of licensing its powerful Pegasus software to countries, including Saudi Arabia, that used it to target individuals, hack into their phones and monitor their communications. Lawsuits against NSO allege the technology was used to target dissidents and their associates, including a friend of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year. Shortly after the Guardian\u2019s report was published last Friday, Novalpina Capital announced it would strengthen internal checks to prevent NSO\u2019s technology being used to violate human rights. The Guardian\u2019s discovery raised concerns at Index on Censorship, the free-speech campaign group. NSO has come under sustained criticism from groups such as Amnesty International following allegations about the subjects of hacking attacks apparently using NSO technology. Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident based in Canada, alleged in a lawsuit filed in Israel that Saudi spies used NSO software to hack his phone and access his conversations with Khashoggi, who was later murdered by government operatives. A group of Mexican activists and journalists is also suing NSO in Israel. They allege Mexican authorities targeted their phones with Pegasus after paying NSO $32m to license the software. In her resignation statement, Peel said: \u201cIn light of a concerted lobbying campaign against my husband\u2019s recent investment, I have taken the decision to step down as CEO of the Serpentine Galleries. \u201cI am saddened to find myself in this position. I have dedicated the majority of my professional life to public service in the cultural sector. I am proud of all that has been achieved for art and artists in my roles as co-founder of Outset, chair of Para Site Art Space and supporter of many arts institutions in London. \u201cThe work of the Serpentine \u2013 and its incomparable artistic director \u2013 cannot be allowed to be undermined by misguided personal attacks on me and my family. These attacks are based upon inaccurate media reports now subject to legal complaints. I have decided I am better able to continue my work in supporting the arts, the advancement of human rights and freedom of expression by moving away from my current role,\u201d it continued. \u201cA word for the wonderful community of artist and supporters, with whom I will continue to engage. The world of art is about free expression. But it is not about bullying and intimidation. I welcome debate and discussion about the realities of life in the digital age. There is a place for these debates, but they should be constructive, fair and factual \u2013 not based upon toxic personal attacks,\u201d it read. \u201cIf campaigns of this type continue, the treasures of the art community \u2013 which are so fundamental to our society \u2013 risk an erosion of private support. That will be a great loss for everyone,\u201d it concluded. The Serpentine\u2019s chairman is Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, whom Peel has called a mentor. Spokespeople for Bloomberg and the Serpentine did not immediately respond to questions on Tuesday about whether the two had discussed NSO. NSO has declined to comment on specific allegations of abuse of its technology, but has said it reviews cases when abuse is alleged to have occurred."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
