Babies cry a lot and sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what it is they have to worry about. My son gets upset around beards and complains in the strongest terms when we refuse to let him eat soil from our pot plants. When he shrieks because I have stopped him headbutting the kitchen table, part of me starts mentally picking out military academies to toughen him up a bit. But, when it comes to teething, I find it weird that he\u2019s not more upset about the Cronenberg movie taking place inside his mouth. What\u2019s weirder is that no one else seems to find this as horrifying as I do. Teeth are greeted with joy and celebration, and then we enlist the help of fairyfolk to mythologise their departure and begin the whole thing all over again. Even my father \u2013 a man who famously claimed he\u2019d \u2018never met the Easter Bunny\u2019 when we asked why our chocolate eggs arrived each year without ceremony \u2013 was a close business acquaintance of the Tooth Fairy, negotiating a 50p-per -unit deal that was remarkably lucrative for its time. Sure, we assuage the pain of a teething child, but as if they\u2019ve grazed their knee or cut their finger. This seems wildly incommensurate with the horror of what\u2019s actually happening, so let me give you a reminder. Consider, for a moment, that the body\u2019s hardest, sharpest materials \u2013 long buried \u2013 are now waking up, for the sole purpose of stabbing you from the inside out \u2013 your gums reduced to a thin film of pink-white gore, stretched to fissure by shards of hard, white diamond. The flesh is inflamed and swollen for it is, after all, being pierced from within by chthonic tusks driving ceaselessly through the pain barrier and into your waiting mouth. There is no retreat, for there is no external foe. Like any good horror movie, this call is coming from inside the house. Teeth, the only body parts we keep solely to grind, tear, rip and lacerate, are cutting and twisting from below, slouching towards birth for their first gory banquet \u2013 the rubbery pulp of your infant gums. The fact that this happens to us 20 times when we\u2019re babies, and then 32 more when we\u2019re old enough to remember, is strange, but that we grow to smile at this horror, to look back with fondness at these milestones, is stranger still. Maybe, in the end, that\u2019s all a smile really is; a display of what we\u2019ve endured thus far, a laugh in the face of past hardships, each tooth an archer\u2019s finger formed in a V. Through all his pain and wailing, we remind ourselves that there\u2019ll be a toothy grin at the end of it, then wobbly molars, and visits from the Tooth Fairy for him, too. I\u2019m led to believe her prices have inflated steadily since we were last acquainted, but, one week into this horror show, I reckon he\u2019s already earned every penny.
