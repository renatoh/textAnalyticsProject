Frank Warren had been eyeing a Rees-Khan world-title fight provided the 27-year-old Welshman emerged as a winner in the first defence of the title he won last summer and Khan then beat Denmark's Martin Kristjansen in a lightweight world-title eliminator in Bolton on April 5. But the previously undefeated Rees suffered damage to his nose and an ear and is likely to be sidelined for months. The promoter is now considering a match for Khan against the big-punching Australian Michael Katsidis, 27, who lost for the first time as a professional in a thrilling battle with the 36-year-old Cuban Joel Casamayor in Cabazon, California, and surrendered the interim WBA lightweight title. Katsidis was floored twice in the first round but fought back to have Casamayor down in the sixth before being stopped in the 10th, when he was ahead on two of the judges' cards. \"Katsidis can only fight one way. He is a brawler and a tremendous puncher,\" Warren said. \"He fought Graham Earl in Britain last year and it was the best fight that we saw in this country in 2007. I think a fight between Khan and Katsidis could be a classic and it is certainly one I will be thinking about making for Amir if he can come through against Kristjansen.\" Kotelnik, 30, had failed to win two previous world-title challenges against the Frenchman Souleymane M'baye, from whom Rees won the WBA title, but the Ukrainian's tight defence and accurate counterpunching meant he was able to move clear in the second half of a fight in which Rees had gained an early advantage through his frenetic work rate. Rees, 4\u00bd inches shorter at only 5ft 3in, kept trying to force the issue but his tendency to hold his hands low after launching body attacks made him an ever easier target for the sharp hooks to the head which were eventually to take their toll. \"I didn't think he was going to hit that hard,\" Rees said after the referee had halted the fight. \"He caught me on the right ear in the third round. I didn't know what was happening after that, to be honest. But I'll be back. It's my first career loss and I'm only 27.\" Kotelnik said he would like to fight Ricky Hatton, who will return to the ring on May 24 to fight Juan Lazcano. \"I've come for the third time to Britain to fight here [as well as the M'baye defeat last year, he lost to the WBC champion, Junior Witter, in a European title fight three years ago],\" he said. \"Now I've achieved my goal and that means everything to me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
