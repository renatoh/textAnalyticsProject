He sometimes sounds like a lone voice in the dark when he preaches how Watford can achieve what is logically unachievable. But a team who looked doomed long before Christmas have just enjoyed their best week since promotion. Two victories in four days is a fantastic shot in the arm, and this one was extra special because it was their first win on their travels, and came with the added gloss of knocking last year's FA Cup finalists out of the competition. West Ham, who departed the competition to a chorus of boos, should be more worried about a different kind of possible impossible as their troubles shows no sign of abating. They lacked the heart and imagination to apply much pressure to a Watford team whose work ethic was faultless. The tie brought together two sides enjoying successful seasons and two managers full of mutual admiration for making it happen. The value of the FA Cup to teams embroiled in relegation matters is a double-edged sword. Do you need the extra games? The threat of injury? On the other hand distraction and a confidence boost is no bad thing. Alan Curbishley could not help hoping that a Cup run would be a 'springboard' to better things in the Premiership. It is not in his nature to be a fount of optimism - his programme notes consisted of one lament after another - but he could not disguise his pleasure at the arrival of Lucas Neill. It was just as well the Australian chose this corner of East London, because West Ham's defence is in dire need of an extra body. With four back players unavailable, and having shipped 11 goals in the past four games, Neill slotted straight into the side at right back. The early signs were encouraging for West Ham as Carlton Cole harassed Ben Foster into conceding an early corner, from which Bobby Zamora shaved the crossbar with a firm header. Watford, buoyed by a rare win at Blackburn's expense in midweek, responded with a spell of more purposeful football, and subjected West Ham to an aerial bombardment that would eventually catch out the home defence. They thought they had scored when Damien Francis poked the ball past Roy Carroll, only to be denied by an offside flag, and were unlucky not to pounce on 35 minutes when Darius Henderson's header was deflected off the line by Cole. West Ham roused themselves midway through the first half to challenge Foster's goal three times, but the young goalkeeper on loan from Manchester United showed his assurance by dealing with Nigel Quashie's potshot and then an angled drive from Shaun Newton. The one time Foster was caught unawares at a corner, Jordan Stewart was on hand to shepherd the ball away. Is Foster had done his bit in keeping West Ham at bay, unfortunately for the home side, the man in the opposite goalmouth did the opposite as four minutes before half time Watford took the lead their energy levels just about deserved. Carroll made a horrible hash of a teasing cross from the right, rushing out to fudge his punch under pressure from Henderson, and Anthony McNamee was on hand to flick an overhead kick into the open goal. The travelling Watford fans, who have endured a miserable season on the road this season, were overjoyed. They really found their voice, teasing Neill when he was booked by suggesting: 'You're only here for the money.' He was replaced just after half time having caught a first half whack. Not the most auspicious debut. West Ham struggled to fight back. When Zamora sent in another dangerous header, it flew over the crossbar. Then Cole cruised past Jay DeMerit and into the box, where he threw himself over Malky Mackay's challenge and was booked for diving by Howard Webb. Newton was next to take aim, and snatched at his shot to send it wide. It was all a little desperate. The old head of Teddy Sheringham was sent on to spread some wisdom in a 4-3-3 formation. But Watford were likelier scorers with two crisp counter-attacks, inspired by Tommy Smith and Hameur Bouazza. Henderson could not quite connect with either of them to kill the game off. Six minutes from time Sheringham, of all people, spurned the opportunity to equalise when he went for a looping chip from close range with the goal at his mercy. It enabled Stewart to glance the chance away, and a flurry of West Ham players could not finish it off. They only have themselves to blame. Man of the match: Ben Foster On a day his opposite number Roy Carroll will want to forget, the young keeper handled what little West Ham threw at him with authority, agility, and spirit. He commanded his penalty area with great presence and on the evidence of another strong performance has a big future ahead of him. He gave his defence con\ufb01 dence and rarely looked as if he was going to be beaten."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
