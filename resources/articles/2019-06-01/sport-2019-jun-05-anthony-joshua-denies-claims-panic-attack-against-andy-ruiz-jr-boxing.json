I know there\u2019s a lot of accusations or worries about what was wrong with me,\u201d the British heavyweight said in a video released on his YouTube channel. \u201cI warmed up really well. I had no panic attack \u2013 I\u2019m not that type of person, you know me. I have to take my loss like a man. No blaming anyone, no blaming anything. I\u2019m the one who went in there to perform and my performance didn\u2019t go to plan.\u201d Lennox Lewis was among those to suggest Joshua should look for a new trainer, but the 29-year-old has insisted he will stick with McCracken. \u201cI took my first [professional] loss. How to explain that feeling? It has happened to me before but I feel like those times I lost years back have made me a stronger person,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t really changed me, my work ethic, my mindset, what I stand for, the people I\u2019m still loyal to \u2013 my trainer Rob McCracken, my amateur coach at Finchley ABC. I\u2019m still going to work with these guys, they\u2019ll teach me everything I need to know.\u201d Joshua has vowed to win back the IBF, WBA and WBO titles he lost in a rematch with the Mexican-American later this year, and suggested that could happen in New York. \u201cI would not mind if it was in New York again, I would not mind if it was in England,\u201d he said. \u201cBut New York opened their arms for me and my whole team and it was phenomenal.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m the one who has to adjust, analyse and do my best to correct it and get the job done in the rematch. Boxing is a part of my life and I\u2019m a champion at heart. Congratulations to Andy Ruiz, he has six months or so to be champion because the belts go in the air and he has to defend them against myself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
