More importantly, Bristol City have rediscovered the momentum which could see them claim back-to-back promotions and scoop the \u00a360m windfall of reaching the top-flight. Michael McIndoe added the gloss with a late free-kick but it was Trundle who repaid a huge slice of his fee with a strike which killed off the Eagles' challenge led by Ben Watson. Watson, who opened the scoring, went from hero to zero when his 71st minute penalty rebounded off the post and Trundle made the most of the lifeline to boost Bristol City's bid for a place in the top flight after a 28-year absence. \"It was a great goal from Lee and we have players with great quality,\" said City's manager, Gary Johnson. \"He's a fantastic footballer and has ability not seen at any level. We knew if we got him fit and working hard we have match-winner in him. He's becoming a hero we thought he'd be. It could have gone either way. To get through you need heart and endeavour and we had that. We made a mistake with their goal but I trust these players with their fitness and commitment late on. It's a credit to the medical team, staff and my players to work hard for games like this. \"Neil Warnock congratulated me and wished us well which says everything. Forget the mind games off the pitch, it's down to the players and they proved that. We just need to win one game now which is one of the biggest games in the world.\" Watson levelled the tie when he profited from a defensive blunder to head past City's goalkeeper Adriano Basso in the 24th minute. The home side huffed and puffed but when Nick Carle tripped Tom Soares in the area Watson saw his penalty crash off the post and the game went into extra-time. It was then Trundle's turn to seize on an error from Jose Fonte to curl home a stunning strike in the 104th minute before McIndoe wrapped up the tie six minutes later to spark joyous scenes. Crystal Palace manager's Warnock played down post-match altercation with a home supporter as he left the pitch. Instead he focused on picking his young players up in readiness for a promotion challenge next term having masterminded a remarkable turnaround in fortunes since arriving in south London last October. \"It was nothing, one young lad caught me. It's something every fan in the country would want to do,\" said Warnock. \"The players are gutted, you could hear a pin drop in the dressing room. We will be stronger for this setback. There's tears but it's unusual for me. I haven't lost too many play-off games and it's not a nice feeling. Considering where we have come from, it's been a success. One of the most successful I've ever had. As a group I was proud of them.\" Warnock refused blame Watson: \"The penalty would have won the game, I think that was clear. Ben has guts to take it so you can't fault him. He's a genuine player and will come back stronger.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
