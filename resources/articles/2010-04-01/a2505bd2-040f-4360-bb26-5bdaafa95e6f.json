She and her family worked hard and got on but she remained loyal to the party. And when she met the boss in Rochdale, she told him bluntly, the way you do in the family, what she thought he was doing wrong. On camera, Gordon Brown took it manfully. They parted with a warm handshake. Then he climbed into the official car and single-handedly turned a minor conversation into what now looks set to go down as the political catastrophe of the 2010 campaign. Election gaffes are all different, but they have a common anatomy. They confirm an essential truth. When Mr Brown angrily blamed the staff member who had set up the conversation and described Mrs Duffy as \"bigoted\" into the still-live Sky radio mic before his car had turned the corner, every gossipy charge made about his personality suddenly became more plausible. But it was more than that. It exposed the hypocrisy of politicians, pretending a stage-managed event was spontaneous. It revealed, again, the arrogant disdain of the elected for the electorate. Mrs Duffy's views, right or wrong, may be shared by millions of older voters. Now they will also share Mrs Duffy's subsequent bewilderment and distress. Factor in the utter defeat of Mr Brown's posture in a BBC radio studio a little later, his hastily rearranged schedule to apologise in person, and the unsuccessful statement to camera as he came out on to Mrs Duffy's doorstep \u2013 and a mildly unsuccessful voter encounter had gathered enough momentum in the media to strike a large blow, on the eve of a key televised debate tonight, to a faltering campaign. Yet it is also possible that the only lesson from yesterday's events is to remember to take off the microphone. This is not the campaign's Sharron Storer moment, when Tony Blair was charged with failing to live up to his promises on the NHS, nor Mrs Thatcher back in 1983 being cornered by Diana Gould on the sinking of the Belgrano. Mrs Duffy's views are not shared by all Labour people, and forcing Mr Brown to declare himself a penitent sinner on a Rochdale housing estate, if it is an example of anything, shows only how irresistible the power of the media can become, how rapidly and irrationally an exasperated comment by a tired man fighting a long and cheerless election campaign can snowball into a major political event broadcast live to the US on CNN and Fox. Yesterday was not a good day for the Labour campaign. But it was not a good day for politics either. It was a revealing moment, a snapshot which captures much that is wrong with the whole political environment. And yes, it was a disaster for Gordon Brown. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 April 2010, correcting the spelling of Sharron Storer's name"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
