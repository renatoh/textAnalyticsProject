Stick around on site for Barney's report. But from me, cheerio! \"I'm the proudest man in the world,\" says Taylor. \"That kid is phenomenal. All of a sudden the darts started going the right side of the wire and the crowd got behind me.\" I can't type quickly enough to keep up, but Taylor is also paying a tribute to Waddell. \"I don't know how long I can keep doing this for,\" he says. \"But I'm chuffed to bits.\" \"Phil played awesome,\" says Van Gerwen. That was rather extraordinary from Taylor. At 4-2 down he looked a beaten man. But he simply refused to crumble, kept his consistency and by the time he hit top gear in the final couple of sets Van Gerwen was a shambling shell of the player he had been earlier in the match. MVG, whose head must be spinning, gets a \u00a3100,000 cheque to cushion the blow of the defeat. He offers a wry smile to the crowd, who give him a very warm hand. Taylor smiled broadly as he receives the Sid Waddell Trophy from Sid's son. I imagine he knows the weight and heft of that trophy pretty well by now. 11th set: Taylor 3-1 Van Gerwen (Taylor wins 7-4 in sets) \"Still about 15 minutes behind John,\" writes Simon McMahon, who'll still be here after we're gone at this rate. \"Taylor just gone 5-4 up. This is truly remarkable sport. Taylor is like a darting Ali, MVG a young Foreman. Brilliant.\" Taylor zooms down to 91 with some stunning round-the-board stuff. Is this the moment? Double 16 for a 12-dart leg and the championship \u2026 Never. In. Doubt. Phil Taylor is the world champion yet again. 11th set: Taylor 2-1 Van Gerwen (Taylor leads 6-4 in sets) Van Gerwen keeps dropping down to the bull after popping his first two darts into treble 20. It's a bit of a weird habit really. Taylor gets a look at 167, but can't make it. Van Gerwen comes back to attack 103, with Taylor waiting on 36. The Dutchman is miles wide of his double 16, though. He's not expecting to come back again \u2026 but he does after Taylor misses three darts at double 18! Ach, but Van Gerwen goes inside on double 12 and double six then goes low on double three. He doesn't get another chance. Taylor is one leg from a 16th title. 11th set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen (Taylor leads 6-4 in sets) Taylor gets four darts down the route to a nine-dart finish and he's entirely in control. He misses double top for an 11-dart leg, but nails the 12th. 11th set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen (Taylor leads 6-4 in sets) If Van Gerwen comes back from this it'll be a sporting miracle. He has the darts in this set, though. A 140 and a 134 open up a decent cushion, with Taylor slow out of the blocks. He'll have at least six darts at 92. He needs just four. An important confidence booster that. 10th set: Taylor 3-1 Van Gerwen (Taylor leads 6-4 in sets) Van Gerwen has the throw but a 177 from Taylor wrenches that advantage from his grasp. A big 140 takes the Power down to 126. Van Gerwen needs to pull something out of the bag \u2026 and it's a 180! Oof! Can Taylor make it irrelevant? No. Van Gerwen has 69 \u2026 and makes a real hash of it after drifting into the single three bed. Taylor has one dart at double 16 for a two-set lead \u2026 and plonks it home! Taylor wins the 10th set. He's just one set from victory now. Van Gerwen needs an unlikely three on the bounce. 10th set: Taylor 2-1 Van Gerwen (Taylor leads 5-4 in sets) You get the feeling that the tide has turned for good here. Van Gerwen has gone from dominant superman to a rabbit in the headlights. Taylor has a look at 164 but can't make it. Van Gerwen at 170 \u2026 likewise. Taylor misses 64. Van Gerwen has 106 \u2026 and nails it with the double 18! What a response that is from the 23-year-old. 10th set: Taylor 2-0 Van Gerwen (Taylor leads 5-4 in sets) The Power increases his grip with a 180, his fifth of the match, that puts Van Gerwen under so much pressure it's a wonder he's not fossilised. The youngster is being torn apart now. An 11-dart leg for Taylor. 10th set: Taylor 1-0 Van Gerwen (Taylor leads 5-4 in sets) Three sets on the bounce for Taylor. It's Van Gerwen's turn to cling on by his fingertips and he's struggling early on here. Taylor is throwing first and again he's down to a finish \u2013 102 \u2013 in the blink of an eye. Van Gerwen is nowhere but Taylor misses three darts at the double and Van Gerwen can steal it with a 96 \u2026 but doesn't. Taylor won't give him another chance surely? Er, no. Ninth set: Taylor 3-2 Van Gerwen (Taylor leads 5-4 in sets) Yet. Another. Decider. The sixth in the nine sets. A huge couple of minutes coming up here. They're blow-for-blow on their first trio of visits to the oche but then Van Gerwen, who has the throw, gets a first look at a finish \u2013 107. Taylor loiters ominously on 40. And the Dutchman can't make it, leaving Taylor the chance to edge ahead in sets for the first time. And he does it! Taylor wins the ninth set! Ninth set: Taylor 2-2 Van Gerwen (The players are level 4-4 in sets) For the first time there, the players looked affected by the pressure on the doubles. The scoring was remarkable but the finishes incredibly scrappy. Again the scoring is insane here. Taylor races down to 16 after nine darts and needs just two more to polish off the leg. Ninth set: Taylor 1-2 Van Gerwen (The players are level 4-4 in sets) The pace has quickened, which you would think plays into Van Gerwen's hands, although the momentum feels about as level as it has been all match. Van Gerwen races down to 137, Taylor to 167. The Dutchman can't get home. Can Taylor? No. And he can't apply much pressure to Van Gerwen's 78. But the youngster misses. It's tense. Taylor has 109 \u2026 and misses double top! Van Gerwen doesn't. Ninth set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen (The players are level 4-4 in sets) A quick one \u2013 Taylor, under no real pressure, gets home from 56. Ninth set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen (The players are level 4-4 in sets) 2-0, 2-2, 4-2, 4-4 \u2013 that's been the pattern. Every time Taylor looks a beaten man, his relentless consistency drags him back into the match. Taylor is expecting to come back for double top \u2026 and does so successfully, despite Taylor attempting an audacious double 16, double 20, 72 checkout. Cripes. Simon McMahon is slowly catching up: \"Ok, so I've been fast forwarding the adverts and am now about 20 minutes behind. It's 4-2 MVG. And I still don't know if any of this is being published. Looking like Taylor needs the greatest comeback since Lazarus if he's to win.\" Eighth set: Taylor 3-1 Van Gerwen (The players are level 4-4 in sets) Another scrappy opening from both players. This set has been the worst of the match so far in terms of scoring but it's been tight and tense nevertheless. And, anyway, Van Gerwen's just thrown back-to-back 140s to leave 64 and Taylor a 180 to leave 24. Van Gerwen misses out but Taylor drops down to double three, everyone's least favourite double, and nails it. Taylor wins the eighth set. We're all square once more! Eighth set: Taylor 2-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-3 in sets) Taylor's cruising in this one as Van Gerwen slows again \u2013 he's blown both hotter and colder than Taylor, while the old man has been pretty consistent throughout. This time the Power takes three darts to polish off 32, but he's got his nose in front once more. Eighth set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-3 in sets) Taylor gets a look at 136, with MVG on 68. And what a finish \u2013 treble 20, treble 20, double eight brings the biggest roar from the crowd in a while. Eighth set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-3 in sets) Van Gerwen had two darts for that set and missed them both. Will he be able to shake off that disappointment? Taylor has the throw in this set and it's a slow start from both players. Neither can find a treble but it's Taylor whose first onto a finish. He'll have a look at 79, with Van Gerwen back on 100. Taylor misses double top, but the Dutchman can't take advantage. Taylor comes back and misses double 10 on the inside then double five on the inside! Van Gerwen does take advantage this time and wins the scruffiest leg of the match so far. Seventh set: Taylor 3-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-3 in sets) Another decider then. Van Gerwen has the throw, but back-to-back 60s open the door to Taylor, who misses out with a grim 42. Taylor throws a superb 174 to give him a 51 checkout. Even so, down from 103 Van Gerwen has a shot at double 16 for the set and a 5-2 lead. He misses, Taylor hits! Phil Taylor wins the seventh set! Seventh set: Taylor 2-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets) You can take the temperature of the match here by the crowd noise \u2013 roaring chants early in the sets, near-silence as we get down to the business end. Taylor can't check out 70 \u2026 and Van Gerwen is tiny tadge away from a 158 in response. A relieved Taylor again scraps through but he's under pressure almost constantly here. Seventh set: Taylor 1-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets) Van Gerwen's standard slips with his first two trips to the oche in this leg and Taylor gets his nose in front. He'll get the first look at a finish, but it's a chunky 128. Van Gerwen applies the pressure with a 180 taking him down to 83. Taylor pushes the wire of the bull and Van Gerwen has his opponent shaking ahead with disbelief thanks to a double nine. Seventh set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets) Both players' average are well above 100. Both are checking out at over 50%. This is a phenomenal standard. Taylor gets a look at 110 \u2026 but narrowly misses double top. Van Gerwen can't take advantage, though, and Taylor scraps home with a double 10. Seventh set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets) Van Gerwen has the throw, and gets the first look at a finish. He can't polish off 128, so Taylor has to knock in 95 to take the lead. Bull, 13, but wide on double 16! The relentless Van Gerwen punishes the mistake. Taylor is really struggling to keep pace here. Sixth set: Taylor 1-3 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets) Mighty Mike thunders in another 180 and raises pulses by plonking his fourth dart in the treble 20 but there'll be no nine-darter on this occasion. He's comfortably ahead in this leg though and will have six darts at 61, with Taylor stranded on 254. Van Gerwen can't find double 18, though. And Taylor tweaks the pressure up with a 140 \u2026 but Van Gerwen calmy pops it in on his return. Van Gerwen wins the sixth set. Sixth set: Taylor 1-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets) Van Gerwen hammers in a 180 to pile the pressure on Taylor. And follows up with another! Van Gerwen gets a first look at 84 \u2026 misses. Taylor on 74 \u2026 suck, suck, suck \u2026 one dart at double top \u2026 hits! Sixth set: Taylor 0-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets) \"Hi John, enjoying your leg-by-leg while I lie here in hospital with a broken arm,\" writes the unfortuante Martin Burley. \"My non-throwing arm, luckily ... which got me wondering: Have any darts players competed while their non-throwing arm was in plaster?\" Good question. Anyone? Taylor is mainlining throat lozenges now. Again Van Gerwen's down to 40, with Taylor back up the hill at 167. The Dutchman hits it first time. He's checking out a a ludicrous 63% at the moment. Sixth set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets) Taylor kicks off with a ton then a 99, which counts as poor scoring such is the standard thus far. Van Gerwen ploughs through the open door with a juggernaut of a 180. With the Dutchman poised on 40, Taylor has to take out 148 \u2026 and he's a whisker away from double 14. Van Gerwen slots home double top and takes the leg against the throw. Fifth set: Taylor 2-3 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets) Van Gerwen opens the door with a 57 to open the leg. Taylor hands the advantage back with a 45. The crowd go as quiet as they have been all night \u2013 they know this is a big one. In a flash Van Gerwen is down to 70 and will have six darts at it. He needs just three, double four giving him the lead once more. Van Gerwen wins the fifth set! Fifth set: Taylor 2-2 Van Gerwen (The match is 2-2 in sets) So Taylor leads for the first time in the match and needs this leg to confirm it. A 137 gives Taylor a look at 94, with Van Gerwen poised on 90. An important few darts coming here. Taylor has one dart at double top \u2026 but drifts high. Van Gerwen hits two, but recovers with treble 20 and nails his first dart at double 14! What a pair of darts they were. Fifth set: Taylor 2-1 Van Gerwen (The match is 2-2 in sets) Van Gerwen's scoring has dropped dramatically here. He can't get going. He growls at himself after a 97 but Taylor isn't quite as relentless here either. Nevertheless the Power gets a first look at a finish, though this time he can't polish off 170. Van Gerwen misses out on 147, so Taylor is back for 65. Twenty-five, double top, all over. Fifth set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen (The match is 2-2 in sets) Van Gerwen is nowhere here. Taylor takes the leg with a pressure-free double 16. Fifth set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen (The match is 2-2 in sets) So Van Gerwen has the advantage of the throw in this set. Can he stem the tide? Not if Taylor keeps playing like this. He kicks off the fifth set with a 180, his third. Still, Van Gerwen is going to get a look at 170. Taylor hit one earlier \u2026 the two trebles go in but he's just wide of the bull. The Power has a look at 89, but makes a right old hash of it and Van Gerwen polishes off 25 with his third dart finding double 8. Here's Simon McMahon with an awkward request: \"Wow! Wow! Wow! The first ever LBL. Christmas 2013 has come (very) early. Guardian live commentaries just keep on giving. Can't follow it though because I've been out and so am an hour behind. Don't tell me what happens.\" Fourth set: Taylor 3-2 Van Gerwen (The match is 2-2 in sets) The players exchange 140s, but MVG nails a second to gain the advantage. He's got six darts from 221 and a 105 gives him a finish of 116. Can Taylor pour on the pressure? Oh yes. A 138 leaves the Power with double top. But will he get the chance? The Dutchman has one dart at double top for the set \u2026 but he's a whisper away. Taylor makes no mistake and has a little jig in celebration as the crowd goes nuts. Taylor wins the fourth set. Fourth set: Taylor 2-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-1 in sets) It's Taylor's turn to go off the boil. Van Gerwen is down to double top, with the Power stranded on 252. He misses the big one, but knocks home double 10. We're down to another decider. Fourth set: Taylor 2-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-1 in sets) \"Stand up for Sid Waddell,\" sing the crowd. The trophy has been renamed in the late commentator's honour for this year's tournament. Taylor bangs in a 180 and looks skywards, which might well have been his own little tribute to the great Sid. A nice touch, if so. Van Gerwen is crumbling a little here. Taylor wins this one at a canter. Fourth set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-1 in sets) That leg gives the Dutchman the break but he's all over the shop in this one. Taylor has six darts at 57 with Van Gerwen nowhere. He takes five but gets there in the end. We're back on throw. Fourth set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-1 in sets) How will the youngster react to that setback? That final leg of darts was a shocking one from him. And he's begun this leg in equally sloppy fashion. But a 177 brings him back into the leg and a 140 gives him the advantage. Taylor is expecting to come back at 72 \u2026 but Van Gerwen checks out from 132. \"He's good,\" says Taylor to someone stage left. Third set: Taylor 3-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-1 in sets) Van Gerwen starts with a 96, but Taylor can't take advantage early on. But a 37 gives him another chance. That was the first big error from the Dutchman. The door is wide open for Taylor now \u2026 and he drives a truck through it. A 140 gives him six darts at 41. He needs only three. Taylor wins the third set. Third set: Taylor 2-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-0 in sets) Both players throw in 59s but Taylor has a bit of breathing space here. A 140 leaves him six darts at 120. Shanghai time? Oh yes. Everyone loves a bit of Shanghai. Third set: Taylor 1-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-0 in sets) The Dutchman is so quick to throw. The crowds are still standing cheering the last double when he's two darts into his opening throw. This time, though, his scoring drops just a touch and it opens the door to Taylor. He's expecting to come back for three darts at 68 \u2026 but Van Gerwen slips his final dart into the bull for a superb 123 checkout under pressure. Third set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-0 in sets) That takes Van Gerwen's average up to over 108. Taylor lagging with 102. Taylor is a millimetre from losing on his throw here, with Van Gerwen just wide on double 11 from a 142 checkout. Taylor breathes a sigh of relief then nails double 16. Third set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-0 in sets) Van Gerwen has the advantage of the throw in this set and a great chance to take a three-set lead. His third 180 of the match leaves him with 47 \u2026 and he checks out first time. Another 11-dart leg! This is emphatic stuff from the Dutchman. Second set: Taylor 1-3 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 2-0) A 180 from Van Gerwen gives him an early lead, but Taylor is being equally relentless. Van Gerwen misses out on 124 and Taylor has three darts at 130 \u2026 with his final dart bullseye will take it \u2026 but he's an inch out. Van Gerwen doesn't give him a second chance, double 16 clinches the second set! Second set: Taylor 1-2 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 1-0) Every leg has gone with the throw thus far. A 140 gives Taylor a shot at 127 put Van Gerwen applies pressure and the 15-time champ can't even get a look at a double. Van Gerwen gobbles up 98. An 11-dart leg! Second set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 1-0) Van Gerwen hits his first 180 of the match and he's first on to a finish, but misses the bull. Taylor can't check out from 154, though, and the Dutchman clinches it. Big news from out man at Ally Pally, the wordsmith that is Barney Ronay: Second set: Taylor 1-0 Van Gerwen (Van Gerwen leads 1-0) That was important for the youngster \u2013 you feel he needed to get off the mark early. Taylor has the advantage of the throw for the second set, though. Back-to-back 140s give him a comfortable lead and he polishes off 68 with aplomb. First set: Taylor 2-3 Van Gerwen Van Gerwen drifts into the five and one beds to hand the initiative to Taylor, but the Dutchman is still going to get the first look at a finish from 140. Taylor puts the pressure on with a 125 that leaves him with 80. But Van Gerwen is ice cool \u2013 treble 20, treble 20, double 10! Van Gerwen wins the first set. How big could that leg be in the grand scheme of things? First set: Taylor 2-2 Van Gerwen Van Gerwen's average is 105 after that leg, but Taylor's is up close to 100. Nevertheless back to back 60s open the door to Van Gerwen, but he can't take advantage, responding with a 59 and an 80. Still, Van Gerwen gets a look at 106 for the first set \u2026 he misses. Taylor, from 85, doesn't. First set: Taylor 1-2 Van Gerwen Oof! That was the perfect way for Taylor to put pressure on his young opponent. A 140 takes Van Gerwen down to 46 and he's got six darts at it, with Taylor nowhere. Three darts later a double eight seals the leg. First set: Taylor 1-1 Van Gerwen Taylor unfurls the first 180 of the match \u2013 and he needed it, a 55 had seen him lose the advantage of the throw. The maximum leaves him with 170 \u2026 and he nails it! What a start! First set: Taylor 0-1 Van Gerwen Right we're off. Van Gerwen throws first and he hits a 140 to give himself six darts at 168 \u2013 he needs only five. I should point out there's plenty of support for Taylor too. A good chunk of the crowd are currently \"Walking in a Taylor Wonderland\". And here comes Phil Taylor. Quite a few of boos for him from the crowd on the back of his Barney barney. He's smiling through it, though. Van Gerwen is first out, the White Stripes Seven Nation Army accompanying him to the stage. The George Dawes of the oche, in lime green, salutes the crowd and gives Ally Pally the thumbs up. Sky have gone to their final pre-match montage. A bit of Foo Fighters for this one. This (we think) is a first for us \u2013 a darts live blog. And it wouldn't be complete without a word from this chap: \"MVG has a fantastic face for telly hasn't he?\" writes Gary Naylor. \"I think he'll have enough tonight - the Taylor/Barney spat showed how much The Power was dimmed by that match. Not good to keep talking about how old you are in the post-match interview either. But can you bet against him? I wouldn't.\" \u2026 you've love this. Look back on the past few weeks at Alexandra Palace in this gallery. A particular favourite is this monochrome snap of Taylor. i) Invite all your friends around and tell them it's fancy dress ii) Put your dining table (if you have one) in front of the TV. iii) Pour yourself a four-pint jug of lager iv) Play this after every leg (actions and singalong compulsory not optional). Voila! Michael van Gerwen's road to the final: 1st round: Paul Lim 3-0 2nd round: Peter Wright 4-2 3rd round: Colin Lloyd 4-1 Quarter-final: Adrian Lewis 5-4 Semi-final: James Wade 6-4 Phil Taylor's road to the final 1st round: Michael Mansell 3-0 2nd round: Jerry Hendriks 4-1 3rd round: Robert Thornton 4-0 Quarter-final: Andy Hamilton 5-0 Semi-final: Raymond van Barneveld 6-4 Well, let's watch darts at least. This year's PDC World Championship final looks set to be a cracker. On one side you've got Phil 'The Power' Taylor, 15 World Championships in the bag, every title and record you could wish for and currently without the world title since 2010 \u2013 the longest time he's been without the big prize in more than 20 years. On the other, you've got Michael van Gerwen, former prodigal teenager now back to his best at the age of 23, who produced 17 perfect darts in his semi-final win over James Wade and looks once more a future powerhouse of the sport. The bookies can't split them \u2013 both are priced 10-11. Taylor clearly has the experience \u2013 he's been in 16 PDC finals and won 13 of them and four of those wins were whitewashes. But Mighty Mike has shown the quality of his temperament already this year, most notably in the quarter-final against the 2011 and 2012 champion Adrian Lewis, who missed two darts for the match. History is not on Van Gerwen's side. Only two players from outside England have ever won the PDC title \u2013 Raymond van Barneveld, who beat Taylor in 2007, and John Part who won in 2003 and 2008. He's already lost twice to Taylor on the Alexandra Palace stage, in 2008 and 2009. But the more recent past gives him hope \u2013 he won World Grand Prix in October and reached the final of the Grand Slam of Darts, beating Taylor in the second round. True, Taylor quietly won five major titles and the World Cup in 2012 but he's been beaten by Van Gerwen on each of their past two meetings. And the 15-time champion has said he may be about to retire after admitting to feeling \"very, very down\" after his semi-final win over (and subsequent bust-up with) Van Barneveld. We've not had a 7-6 final since 2007, but you wouldn't be all that surprised to see one tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
