In turn, my body temperature, fat levels (now you're talking), blood pressure, alertness, mental performance and the synthesis and secretion of numerous hormones are all going haywire, sent into a mad spin by irregular working hours. This could explain why I occasionally feel weird. Professor Jo Arendt and Dr Shantha Rajaratnam, from the University of Surrey in Guildford, believe that the developed world is rapidly becoming a 24-hour society, creating a \"host of new problems\" for those working within it. The two experts, from the university's centre for chronobiology, say that in any urban economy, about 20% of the population is required to work irregular hours, and the figure is likely to increase. Like all living creatures, humans have a built-in clock mechanism governing a wide range of biological and behavioural systems, developed over millions of years. According to the report, screw with this process and you're heading for trouble - sleepiness is commonly linked to industrial accidents, including the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant. (\"Whoops,\" someone must have thought, \"I really should get more kip.\") Part of the secret to surviving nightshifts is an extra-healthy diet and drinking lots of water. Taking a dose of melatonin - a hormone that helps synchronise the body clock - about 20 minutes before you hit the sack also helps. Work too many nights, however, and daytime becomes a fearsome land full of piercing noises and blurry movement and all these things - you know, loud, flapping creatures - people, that's it. You'll develop a musician's \"studio-tan\" - a grey pallor that gives you the appearance of something David Attenborough has just discovered living on the bottom of the ocean. The thought of a face-to-face conversation with a friend fills you with excitement. You are moved to tears by a TV advert for the new Renault. You leave the house without important items, like money, and pants. A bottle of Jack Daniel's at 6am seems like a really good idea. All these things are huge warning signs - it's time to have a break. Preferably with sunlight. Yet there are many benefits to working nights. No stressful, sardine-crush, half-hour train journey to work in the morning - who are all these sweaty, harassed, crazed fools? Do they really do this every single day? At night our busy office of 100-plus people becomes a haven of peace and quiet, host to a team of seven or eight, soothed by the background babble of CNN, Sky, News 24. No phones ring. No email every five minutes. We work at our own pace. The taxi ride home every night is a joy; north to south London in 15 minutes (45 minutes during the day if you're lucky). The moon over the Thames is always a beautiful sight. You are granted a rare glimpse into another world; a full-on police raid, cops with machine guns and body armour kicking in a door, say, or the gang of lads playing football on a misty Clapham Common at 4.30 on a midweek morning. London's real nocturnal rulers - foxes - coolly trot by, casting you disdainful looks for invading their space. As for the small hours delights of BBC2's learning zone, that is a secret shared by we few who have chosen to walk the path of darkness. Forget the scientists. It's all in the mind. Join us!
