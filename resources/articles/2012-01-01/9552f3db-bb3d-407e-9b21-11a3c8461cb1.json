His career-shift into fratboy comedy is running out of steam. The Sitter is his wacky new film, about as edgy as a balsawood butter-knife, about Noah, a sad-case guy played by Jonah Hill. One evening, Noah is bullied into babysitting some appalling kids, but while he's at their house, he takes a call from his bullying girlfriend asking him to buy some cocaine and bring it to the super-hot party she's currently at, so poor put-upon Noah has to take the kids along in their mom's mini-van, first to the crazy drug-dealer \u2013 massive cameo for Sam Rockwell \u2013 then to the party itself. Very light on gags, and then, with an awful inevitability, very heavy on the sentimental life-lessons getting learnt by Noah and his adorable young charges.
