Mr Card, 58, will be replaced by Joshua Bolten, 50, a veteran adviser who is currently serving as budget director. The move was being seen yesterday as an attempt by Mr Bush to try to turn around approval ratings that have fallen below 40%, and to offset growing Republican unease about the midterm elections next November under a White House that appears to have lost its energy and drive. Mr Card's departure, which takes effect on April 14, is a milestone for a president who has set great store by stability and personal loyalty. Mr Card has served as White House chief of staff since the beginning of the Bush administration in 2001, a record for longevity in the post exceeded only by Sherman Adams under President Eisenhower. A presence that was largely behind the scenes, he has told reporters that his working day began at 5.30am and continued long after Mr Bush went to bed. He took his first sick day this month. For most Americans, however, he will be remembered from footage of September 11 2001, which shows him whispering into the ear of a stunned President Bush that a second plane had flown into the World Trade Centre. \"Andy Card has served me and our country in historic times,\" Mr Bush said in making the announcement. \"On a terrible day when America was attacked, during economic recession and recovery, through storms of unprecedented destructive power, in peace and in war.\" Mr Card, standing by his side, said he looked forward to being Mr Bush's friend. \"You're a good man, Mr President.\" In recent times, Mr Card has taken the blame for the failure of the White House to anticipate and deal with crisis: from the administration's sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina, to the mishandled news management following vice-president Dick Cheney's hunting accident, to the recent furore over the takeover of the operations of US ports by a Dubai-based firm. The White House did not foresee that such a deal would trigger an enormous public backlash - a failure the Republicans blamed on Mr Card and a staff that has lost its edge after so many years in the job. It was not clear yesterday whether Mr Bolten would satisfy Republican demands for change at the White House, since he too has been a member of Mr Bush's inner circle from the first days of the administration - and also because the deputy chief of staff, Karl Rove, will remain in his post. As the director of the office of budget and management, Mr Bolten was accorded cabinet rank and worked to create the budgets that called for huge spending on Iraq and Afghanistan, pushing up the deficit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
