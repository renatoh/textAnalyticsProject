A string of famous-name retailers have gone into administration in the past 12 months, including Kwik Save, Hawkshead, Owen Owen and music retailers Fopp and Music Zone. Choices UK, the DVD rental company, went bust after failing to find a buyer. Meanwhile Budgens, DIY store Focus and Ilva, the furniture store backed by private equity firm Advent International, have all faced severe financial challenges. Ravel, the 50-store shoe chain, closed last May. So while the festive season ought to be a lucrative time of year for retailers, there is growing concern that for many, this Christmas could be the last. Last week, the British Retail Consortium revealed that like-for-like sales in October grew at their slowest in nearly a year, up just 1 per cent compared with October last year. BRC director-general Kevin Hawkins says: 'This reflects the downward trend in sales growth we have been anticipating as a consequence of higher interest rates and other pressures on household incomes. It points to some challenging conditions for many retailers in the run-up to Christmas, which are likely to persist.' A research note from Seymour Pierce echoed this: 'October has been a difficult month for retailers. We believe this is further evidence that the pressure on the consumer is working its way through to retail spend, and reiterate our underweight view of the sector.' Sales growth at M&amp;S slowed from 2 per cent in the first quarter to 1.2 per cent in the second, giving an overall figure of 1.6 per cent in the six months to 29 September. Chief executive Stuart Rose believes the way to sidestep stagnation is to increase investment - M&amp;S has earmarked \u00a31.1bn for expansion into India and China. But not all retailers have a solid-gold brand reputation and huge capital reserves to draw on. Among the retailers under most pressure are those owned by private equity. In the past three years private equity and finance buyers have swooped on some of the best-known names in British retailing, including New Look, Peacocks, Somerfield and House of Fraser. Many are now struggling to meet tough growth targets. And just as serious for the private equity tycoons is their ability to fashion an exit via a sale or flotation. 'The exiting prospects are diminishing,' says a prominent retail executive. 'The private equity firms are going to have to hunker down and winter it out.' The first indication that private equity was having difficulty realising profits came this summer when Permira, led by Damon Buffini, pulled its \u00a32bn sale of New Look after bidders refused to match its price tag. Permira now has no alternative but to keep hold of the store. Some analysts believe the huge increase in retail floorspace about to hit Britain - with major new shopping malls in Bristol, Derby, Liverpool and London - will make it hard for existing stores to beat previous years' figures. Others say that no private equity firm will pull the plug on a business this side of Christmas - but predict several casualties early next year. Furniture and carpet stores are likely to be vulnerable. Analysts point out that jewellery firms in the Baugur empire have struggled and that other companies owned by the acquisitive Icelandic retail investor may also be facing difficult conditions. However, sources close to Baugur say its Goldsmiths jewellery operation is looking good for Christmas, as is the rest of its extensive retail portfolio. Meanwhile, attention is on whether Bridgepoint Capital can achieve a sale or flotation of Pets at Home, Britain's biggest pet retailer. Bridgepoint bought Pets at Home in a \u00a3230m deal in 2004. And there are suggestions that Peacocks, the fashion chain owned by a consortium that includes Och-Ziff and Perry Capital, has received at least three unsolicited approaches after appointing Goldman Sachs to carry out a strategic review earlier this year. No deal has yet materialised on a business valued at about \u00a3800m. One leading retail executive believes the gloom has been overdone. 'There's a 20 per cent chance things could get unpleasant. Everybody is getting edgy. There is a minor squeeze but most people are not overly affected.' That may be so, but banks are refusing credit and lowering credit limits. Christmas may not be disastrous this year, but next year probably will be. The list of significant retailers that went to the wall averaged two a month this year. Look for a rise in 2008."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
