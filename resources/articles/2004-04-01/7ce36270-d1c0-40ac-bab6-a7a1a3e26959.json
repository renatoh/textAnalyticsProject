The 33-year-old former Republic captain has not played for his country since he was sent home from the 2002 World Cup on the eve of the tournament and he continues to divide public opinion all across Ireland. Kerr has since succeeded Mick McCarthy, with whom Keane fell out so irrevocably, and with Keane believing he has unfinished business with the Irish the two men reached the point of discussing the matter. It appeared that Keane was set to return only for talks to break down over whether the Manchester United midfielder would play in non-competitive matches as well as European qualification fixtures. Keane's injured hip meant that United wanted him to play as few games as possible for anyone else. It is not known whether any compromises have been reached between Keane, Kerr and the United manager Sir Alex Ferguson but the player is understood to have been impressed by Kerr's managerial discipline. Kerr has avoided comment ing directly on the Keane issue but he has left the door ajar. After Keane said on a promotional trip to Dublin a few weeks ago that there was still an outside chance of his coming back, Kerr said he would welcome any player who had announced his international retirement but who had changed his mind. That included players such as Charlton's Dean Kiely but clearly also Keane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
