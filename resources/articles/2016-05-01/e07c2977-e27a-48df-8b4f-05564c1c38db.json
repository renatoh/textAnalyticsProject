In a speech at Labour\u2019s state of the economy conference on Saturday, he will say the party wants to address the \u201cfreefall decline in home ownership among young people\u201d, pointing to a number of Labour councils that are underwriting mortgages or lending money directly. The idea of councils offering loans for property goes further than George Osborne\u2019s Help to Buy scheme, which guarantees part of a mortgage to enable people to buy with smaller deposits. McDonnell will say: \u201cWe\u2019ll give local authorities the powers to impose local rent regulations where these are needed \u2026 but we have to also meet the aspirations of people to own their own home.\u201d McDonnell said he wanted to see councils following the example of Manchester, Sandwell in the West Midlands and Warrington in Cheshire by offering cheap, local authority-backed mortgages to first-time buyers in particular. \u201cWith too many first-time buyers excluded from the housing market by high street banks, we\u2019ll be looking at ways to securely expand local authority mortgage lending,\u201d he will say. During the conference, Jon Trickett, the shadow communities secretary, will announce that Labour is convening an economic forum of mayors with the aim of \u201csolving the housing crisis\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn will give a speech about moving towards \u201cnew economics\u201d, including greater public investment in modern industry. \u201cWe want to see the reindustrialisation of Britain for the digital age,\u201d the Labour leader will say. \u201cThat means putting public investment front and centre stage, driven by a national investment bank as a motor of economic modernisation, based on investment in infrastructure, transport, housing and the technologies of the future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
