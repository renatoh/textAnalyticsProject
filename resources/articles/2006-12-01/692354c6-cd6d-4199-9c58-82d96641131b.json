Architecture student Tom Dulake designed the scarf after being asked to create a survival pack as part of his sustainable design and architecture course at Bartlett School, London. As his classmates set about designing Swiss army knives, Dulake drew his inspiration from a story he heard as a child about second world war pilots using maps printed on pieces of silk to find their way to safety after being shot down over enemy lines. \"I was really interested in the issue of how homeless people survive on the streets of London every day,\" Dulake says. \"For me, information is the key to survival, so I started thinking about how similar maps could be used to help locate those services that can sometimes provide lifelines.\" Dulake's survival map pinpoints the location of London's hostels, day centres, medical facilities and libraries, and highlights places offering training and employment opportunities. He explains that while most people can access information about vital services through the internet, London's homeless people often have to rely on word of mouth to locate hostels or health centres. Dulake started the project by conducting surveys with homeless people, asking them what services they felt were vital to their day-to-day survival, and has also collaborated with homelessness organisations such as the Big Issue, the Pavement and Crisis Skylight. He says homeless people who are already using the scarf have been largely positive about the project, but admits that his biggest challenge is to make the project economically viable. \"At the moment, each scarf costs about \u00a330 and, with just a student loan at my disposal, I'm finding it difficult to even get a small print-run off the ground,\" he says. In an attempt to raise money for the scheme, he is designing a range of spin-off products, such as silk pashmina's printed with maps showing locations of boutiques, that could be sold in shops and museums. \"A lot of people, including my tutors, have been pretty sceptical about whether it's going to work,\" he says. \"But the feedback I've received from homeless people is enough to convince me it could work and to keep trying to raise the money for a larger print run.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
