I\u2019d like to extend this to the much smaller genre of films about young kids of privilege who get stuck in drug rehabs or mental wards. What adolescent doesn\u2019t want to scowl and spit in the face of square adults who just don\u2019t get it? Moreover, these boys (it\u2019s almost always boys) brood their way right into the hearts and arms of understanding, sexy girls who also refuse to do what society says. What a blast! From David and Lisa to It\u2019s Kind of a Funny Story (making stops along the way with scenes from Ordinary People and lesser known movies like Manic) I\u2019m usually left in a reverie, half-wishing I could ditch the worries of the real world, go back in time, cozy up inside of an institution and find the love of a carefree, unorthodox girlfriend. (This is probably something I should speak to a counselor about.) Being Charlie, the newest film from Rob Reiner based on a somewhat autobiographical screenplay by his son Nick, puts all the others to shame for making teenage drug addiction look so appealing. Not the intention, I\u2019m sure, but dammit I don\u2019t care what society dictates: I tell you the truth! Nick Robinson gives a strong performance as the angst-ridden son of a former film star-turned-gubernatorial candidate (Cary Elwes). His slow march toward sobriety is pretty by the numbers (the program does suggest following steps) but the rote nature of the storyline is fleshed out nicely with a stable of good side characters. This includes an Ezra Miller-esque drug buddy (Devon Bostick), a tough-but-fair halfway house chaperone (Common) and the bottle-blonde love interest Eva (Morgan Saylor). Eva\u2019s name isn\u2019t a coincidence, as her character isn\u2019t given much depth other than to represent temptation. The pair can\u2019t get too intimate for fear of being tossed from the program. When they finally get a weekend furlough, she\u2019s itching to break into a wine collection, despite previously seeming committed to the rules. Charlie can\u2019t afford to stray, as part of a deal he\u2019s set up to avoid a jail stint. (Early in the picture he steals oxycontin from an elderly cancer patient.) The male patients\u2019 enforced chastity sparks quite a few amusing scenes of chatter. Some deviate into the realm of gay panic, but the dialogue is at least creative, and likely reflect reality. Indeed, if Being Charlie has anything going for it, it isn\u2019t the dull father/son showdown at the end, it\u2019s the observational stuff along the way. Getting sober is, strangely, shown as something of a snap set to a musical montage, but the specifics of the rehab-industrial complex and its economics are quite interesting. Part of Charlie\u2019s journey includes finding his voice as a standup comedian. His heroes aren\u2019t musicians or sports figures, but George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor and, in what\u2019s sure to be her only archival appearance in a film this year, Moms Mabley. Charlie\u2019s talent show appearance is a remarkable sequence, and, without overly intellectualizing it, it\u2019s a nice example of how one can turn personal pain into jokes. Story mechanics kick in when a smartphone recording of the candidate\u2019s son saying shocking things about his father ends up on YouTube, but this, like most of the actual plot of Being Charlie, is of secondary interest. Despite its addiction to cliches, by the time Being Charlie ends it\u2019s a little bit emotional, thanks a great deal to Robinson\u2019s performance. The film\u2019s opening sequence is of a bratty rich kid breaking nice stained glass windows to Stax bluesman Albert King\u2019s Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven. \u201cGimme a break,\u201d you think, \u201cwho the hell does this kid think he is? There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to like this jerk!\u201d The closing credits roll under the rich, emotional and far more appropriate-to-the-demographic Fever to the Form by Nick Mulvey, and it\u2019s actually quite inspiring. Charlie isn\u2019t the only one who grows during the picture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
