It required all of United\u2019s resolve, Louis van Gaal\u2019s nous and a highly contentious penalty call to shake off Preston North End at a raucous Deepdale. United were a goal down and facing elimination from a cup competition by League One opposition for the second time this season when Van Gaal changed their shape and the course of the fifth-round tie. Ashley Young, introduced in response to Scott Laird\u2019s breakthrough for Preston, as the United manager opted for width, created a swift equaliser for Ander Herrera. Marouane Fellaini, shifted up front in the rejigged 4-4-2, drove the visitors ahead and Rooney sealed a place in the quarter-finals with his first goal since Boxing Day. Yet Preston, in keeping with a scrap of a tie, had a legitimate grievance with all three United goals. Even Van Gaal conceded his team \u201cgot lucky\u201d with their equaliser, with Rooney standing in an offside position next to the goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, as Herrera\u2019s shot rolled in off the post. Simon Grayson, the Preston manager, felt Fellaini pushed his captain, Tom Clarke, in the build-up to the second and Rooney was central to the most contentious decision of all, sprawling over Stuckmann\u2019s challenge in the 87th minute when no contact was made. The referee, Phil Dowd, had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Grayson was also being kind with his assertion that the England captain had taken evasive action and not a dive over Stuckmann\u2019s outstretched legs. Away from the controversy, however, this was another example of United finding an unconvincing way to win and generating more head-scratching than fear in their opponents. It is now one defeat in 19 matches for Van Gaal\u2019s side, stretching back to early November, and their manager appears no closer to finding the right balance. Deepdale was sold out for the first meeting between these two old north-west rivals since two goals for Alan Gowling gave a United side containing Law, Charlton and Best a 2-0 victory in the FA Cup fourth round 43 years ago. With almost 5,000 United supporters in the Bill Shankly Stand, Preston commemorating the one-year anniversary of Sir Tom Finney\u2019s death and the quarter-final draw shown live on a giant screen inside the ground, the atmosphere was fully charged by kick-off. United dominated possession from the start, seeking to exploit the space behind Preston\u2019s wing-backs through the pace of Antonio Valencia and Luke Shaw, but a lack of quality with the final ball meant Grayson\u2019s team went unpunished. \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Rooney were frequent culprits and on the few occasions United did create an opening, determined defending stood in their way. Di Mar\u00eda was closest to giving the Premier League side a lead at half-time with a free-kick that dipped over Preston\u2019s wall but dropped inches wide. Otherwise the home goalkeeper was rarely troubled before the interval or was expertly protected. John Welsh threw himself in the way of a goalbound shot from Rooney after Shaw picked out the striker from the byline. When Di Mar\u00eda produced a rare moment of class to release Radamel Falcao inside the area, and the Colombia forward squared for Rooney in front of goal, Bailey Wright intervened with a superbly timed challenge. More adventure was evidently Grayson\u2019s half-time request judging by Preston\u2019s committed start to the second half. United\u2019s defence, given scant protection with only Daley Blind on defensive midfield duties, offered them encouragement. Joe Garner invited Laird to attack space on the edge of the United penalty area and the wing-back, punched to the floor by a fan following Stevenage\u2019s defeat of Newcastle United in 2011, drove everything he had through a low shot towards the far corner. Laird\u2019s strike took a slight deflection off Valencia but that did not excuse David de Gea\u2019s weak attempt at a save as the ball sailed beyond his grasp. Van Gaal reacted by replacing the anonymous and off-the-pace Falcao with Young. The switch, that included Di Mar\u00eda moving to the right, paid swift dividends as an injection of pace into the United attack forced Preston to sit deep, too deep as it transpired as Young squared to Herrera and the Basque midfielder managed to send a low shot beyond Stuckmann. Moments later Kevin Davies somehow escaped a second booking for a foul on Chris Smalling. United\u2019s protests were still in full flow when Fellaini secured their place in the quarter-finals, heading Valencia\u2019s cross at goal and reacting quickest when Stuckmann saved to drive the rebound into the roof of the net. Rooney\u2019s spot-kick lessened United\u2019s anxiety in the final stages while adding gloss to their passage into the last eight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
