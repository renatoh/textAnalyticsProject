The old newspaperman remains the arch-magician of print \u2013 wrong-footing his critics, rallying his staff and stunning his rivals with his sheer speed and audacity. More than 40 years after he swooped to buy the ailing Sun newspaper \u2013 and six months after just as shockingly closing the News of the World for corporate reasons \u2013 he is back in business with a Sunday tabloid, due to hit the streets in six days' time. In the main, this is a good decision. Anything that appears to increase the diversity of voices in the press and which gives employment to journalists in troubled times is broadly to be welcomed. And while we're praising Mr Murdoch, we should acknowledge the clarity and judgment he displayed in last week's email to Sun staff. In contrast to the excitable tone struck by some of his own writers, his message was straightforward and realistic. He would allow suspended Sun journalists back to work pending police inquiries and take all steps to protect sources. But he also reaffirmed his determination \u2013 belatedly \u2013 to clean his company up and co-operate with the police in rooting out corruption or criminal behaviour. There were no complaints from Murdoch about the cost of the police operation, nor about its apparent heavy-handedness. He knows how rich that would be. For the purposes of assessing damages his company has now accepted that some of Murdoch's senior UK executives and directors misled the public, lied to the police and destroyed evidence. It is surprising that anyone on the News Corp payroll should have the nerve to complain about the size or cost of the police squads assembled to get at the truth in the face of every obstacle \u2013 legal and illegal \u2013 thrown in their path by the company. Murdoch was ultimately responsible for a series of woeful judgments \u2013 or wilful disregard \u2013 which led to crimes and cover-ups on his watch. All this is unfinished business. News International's management and standards committee (MSC), set up to co-operate with the police and unearth evidence \u2013 something woefully lacking in the original police inquiry into phone hacking in 2006 \u2013 has a thankless task. Wapping journalists, civil rights lawyers and the NUJ are right to keep a very close eye on whether legitimate sources are being imperilled by its operations. It is right, too, that journalists acting in the public interest should be defended, not prosecuted. Equally, it must be right that evidence of serious crime be handed to the police. The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, has said he intends to issue guidelines for the sake of greater clarity for all concerned. Lord Justice Leveson, who is about to consider press-police relations, would surely agree with that. But while we welcome the rising of the Sun on Sunday, it would be unrealistic to claim the venture is not without its problems. The first is the still-unresolved civil and criminal cases. News International's eagerness to settle all the civil cases without full trial or public disclosure is understandable, but it also prevents the full airing of the evidence of who knew what when. The conclusion yesterday of a hitherto unreported criminal case involving computer hacking by a man alleged to have done similar things for the News of the World is a small taste of potential future scandals to come. We will not know how comprehensively the News International swamp has been drained \u2013 to borrow the MSC's terminology \u2013 for months, if not years, to come. Equally significantly, the Sun on Sunday means that once again Murdoch is publishing four national newspapers \u2013 and surely aspires to regain his former dominance, which saw him owning nearly 40% of the national newspaper market. Last July we saw all too clearly the malign effect that dominance had on the cultural, political and regulatory life of this country, not to mention policing. So one can wish that the new Sun shines brightly while still keeping very focused on learning the lessons of the past. But to learn from them, they must first be confronted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
