She was way, way out of my league and during our two years together she would occasionally remind me of this. She drank like a fish, went like a train and flirted with all my friends. Before her, I\u2019d never previously considered myself a man for the fancy cars. I had an Audi once, which was mainly used by a former partner, and that was about it. I simply didn\u2019t appreciate cars enough to spend much time and money on them: they were functional beasts and driving them was a reminder that you weren\u2019t drinking last night and would not be tonight either. The most tedious and pointless conversations I\u2019ve ever had have been about cars. Then, one fateful afternoon, having agreed not to renew the lease on an unprepossessing wee member of the Volvo family, I was persuaded by a friend to test-drive a five-year-old Jaguar XK. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not me and I won\u2019t be able to afford it unless I take a mortgage out on it.\u201d \u201cNonsense,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not as expensive as you think and I can get you a deal on it.\u201d I can get you a deal on it. Is there a more meaningless phrase in the English language or a crueller one? Only unworldly and credulous naifs fall for that sort of patter and I considered myself to be neither of these. My friend, though, knew what he was doing. The sound of the engine as I switched it on acted like a narcotic. It growled like that Maserati Ghibli you hear in those radio adverts. A chap couldn\u2019t fail but to feel good about himself driving a car like this. The fix was in. I didn\u2019t even take her for a test drive; she took me. By the end of our first day together, I\u2019d convinced myself that I needed to take her for a spin through one of those moody Highland glens where all the best car adverts get filmed. I was becoming a petrol-head. On one occasion, I rebuked my daughter when I overheard her telling her sister that Dad\u2019s new car was \u201cgreen\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s racing green,\u201d I hissed. For some reason, I felt compelled always to wear sunglasses when driving her, even on grey and sodden days. It wasn\u2019t long, though, before guilt\u2019s long and icy fingers began to beat his baleful timpani on my back. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a champagne socialist,\u201d he whispered. It was like the Catholic guilt you experienced as a child for dodging Mass and the terror of expecting your sin to be disinterred at any moment. On one occasion, reporting for an early morning BBC news programme to discuss inequality and food banks, I was spotted clambering indecorously out of this low-slung machine. As my broadcasting chums gently chided me for my bourgeois, automotive proclivities I retorted that it was \u201cthe People\u2019s Jag\u201d and that, come the revolution, everyone would be driving cars like this. I even found myself doing that thing where you tell your friends that your car is nowhere near new just in case they thought you were being reckless with your personal finances. But then I was persuaded (with alarming ease) to purchase a private number plate so that people wouldn\u2019t know just how old it really was. Is this how it feels to be a Tory? I wondered. At this rate, I mused with a degree of mortification, I\u2019ll soon be asking my accountant about offshore tax havens and telling people that there are too many immigrants and that Britain is going to the dogs. On another occasion, I offered to give my journalist chum Alex Massie, the acceptable face of Scottish unionism, a lift into town. He shot me a glance that conveyed something between \u201cyou\u2019re kidding\u201d and \u201cyou surely don\u2019t expect me to keep quiet about this\u201d. Once, I noticed with a thrill, two pretty, young women with nice coats looking admiringly at the Jag as I pulled up to a set of traffic lights. This, though, was swiftly followed by a barely discernible look of disappointment when they saw who was driving it. On an assignment for the Observer, when approaching a housing scheme in one of Glasgow\u2019s disadvantaged neighbourhoods, I suddenly panicked: \u201cI can\u2019t be seen driving a car like this up there. It\u2019ll undermine my leftie credentials.\u201d It was then that I knew deep inside that she would have to go. In some of Glasgow\u2019s edgier neighbourhoods, there are stories of traffic lights that have been doctored and controlled remotely from the upper rooms of nearby flats. Whenever a decent car pulls up, the lights are kept at red long enough for a team of masked urchins to remove all tyres, wheels and exhausts and leave the vehicle marooned on brick stilts. I began to grow paranoid that just such a fate must surely be mine, a condign punishment for my unconscionable hypocrisy. I know that, as an official leftie, I\u2019m supposed to care deeply about global warming, carbon reduction and other environmental stuff. In truth, I\u2019ve cared little for it all. This car changed all that; it was about as fuel efficient as a private jumbo jet. My carbon footprint, which had been reducing nicely to a seven or eight, was now approaching 15. You would have needed to plant enough trees to cover half the Caledonian forest to counteract the damage to the planet wrought by my car. And so, last week I traded in my gorgeous, racing green Jag for a nice but unremarkable saloon much more appropriate to my age and station. I admit to stealing one last look at her long, sleek curves but already she was sizing up a younger, fitter and altogether more affluent-looking suitor, the capricious minx."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
