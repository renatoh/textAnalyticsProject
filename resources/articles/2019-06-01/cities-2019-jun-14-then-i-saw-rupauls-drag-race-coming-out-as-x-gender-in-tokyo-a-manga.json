I draw manga and illustrations; I also like to make things. During my childhood I lived in Fukagawa, a downtown area of Tokyo. There is a big shrine and a we had a great festival too. I remember the area when it was picturesque and still undeveloped \u2013 it had a really beautiful atmosphere. When I was old enough to read a manga book, my grandmother bought me a one at a small bookstore in the town. Those small bookstores are all disappearing nowadays. I remember the beautiful sunset and there was a stall of sweet baked potatoes on the street. \u201cDo you want one? Let\u2019s share it,\u201d she said. My grandmother was so sweet, and this was the most peaceful and enjoyable moment in my life. This was my first encounter with manga, and I loved it. It made me want to become a manga artist. I first experienced morning rush hour when I started university. A train comes every two minutes in Tokyo at that time of day, but it is still not enough and there are too many people inside. I really though my internal organs were going to be crushed and it would kill me. I never want to go through it again. It is so stressful to commute every day like this. There is an accident of some sort every day. Nobody cares anymore, because it\u2019s become routine. I dreamed of becoming a manga artist even more, because then I wouldn\u2019t have to go to an office. No more rush hour train: I could work at home. In 2007 at the age of 24, Kodansha, the world\u2019s leading manga publisher, chose my web comic above those of 100 other applicants. I had become a real manga artist! I started living alone near Takao Mountain, which is very famous among climbers, in the city of Nishi-hachioji, on the furthest outskirts of Tokyo. My neighbourhood was very peaceful, and the surrounding area had an incredible view of the mountain that the city-centre could never have. I was immature as a writer and my editor repeatedly rejected my ideas. I started losing confidence and eventually I didn\u2019t understand what I actually wanted to draw. After the 7th episode of my innovative web comic, my life as a manga artist came to an end. It had lasted only three years. This is not rare. Many new artists get depressed and disappear. I am one of them. I was always alone, I drew alone in my room without seeing any daylight. I had hardly gone out so I became physically weak and I rarely spoke to anyone so I started having also a trouble speaking. I felt like I never wanted to draw a manga again. I also lost any admiration for Japanese manga magazines. But I did draw again. There is an annual international manga festival at Tokyo Big Site, where many manga artists, especially those work overseas, gather and I started exhibiting my pieces. Japanese publishers accept works but do things only by the book. So I became more interested in foreign manga industries, as they were more free and more open-minded. Tokyo Big Site is known as a sanctuary for Tokyo Otaku (geeks), but the venue has become very important for me, too. It made me confront myself and ask: What do I like? Who am I? What makes me myself? And then I saw RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. It made my world turn from black and white to rainbow. When I watched the series, my viewpoint got broader and I became more flexible in my thinking The world in my little room has changed completely. I realised that I had never considered myself as a woman. For example, when we meet strangers, we go out for dinner. It\u2019s common here in Japan that many women are treated like a free hostess by men and I couldn\u2019t stand it. I couldn\u2019t stand it because I realised I didn\u2019t want to be seen as a woman. So I stopped going to bars. Going to a bar was like participating in Japanese social ceremony that I didn\u2019t want to be part of. My heart is not feminine, but it isn\u2019t masculine ether. I found out that this is called \u201cX-gender\u201d in Japan and I realised I identified as queer and X-gender. It was the happiest I had been for 10 years \u2013 it ended my doubt and guilt. The manga I was drawing that time was based on the Wizard of Oz. It is a story that many foreigners could easily accept and also it is a story loved by the LGBTQ community. I became stronger and I was more assertive when I worked. I started thinking I would like to share this energy with people who suffer from the same kind of problems as I had by communicating through my work. I love Harajuku. I didn\u2019t go there for a long time, but since I began to identify as queer, I have started to go to this colourful place. If you are 36 years old, and you still like Harajkuku, many people think you\u2019re strange. But I started communicating with people from many of the shops and exhibiting my artistic work. I also like looking out for the most trendy things here: rainbow food, cosmetics, knick-knacks, photogenic ice-cream. They are all made in Korea, but the origin of Squeez, which you can see everywhere, is Japan. It is an extremely popular object for elementary school students. It\u2019s also very Japanese. It\u2019s soft and comforting. I would like to be an artist who could cause an exciting boom here. There are many men who dress in women\u2019s clothes. They are performers, onlookers, hairdressers or just many different people. There are a lot of outsiders who don\u2019t live with social rules and they shine. You don\u2019t get judged by clothes. Colourful Harajuku, the area of art and queer, is a very comfortable place for me, When I told my friend that I am X-gender, they said \u2018It happens to lots of people. You are thinking too much.\u2019 I posted my manga about coming out on social media because I wanted to communicate my feeling. I got many comments from strangers: \u2018I really sympathise,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve never known such a word. I am ashamed ...\u2019 If my work was a reason that someone started thinking about themselves, my work must have meant something. Through my manga I can communicate with many people. I am happy that I kept drawing \u2013 and that I am queer. Many people in Tokyo don\u2019t know the word and don\u2019t understand my reality. Many say \u2018It\u2019s ok, I\u2019m not biased.\u201d But being queer means the being the target of prejudice. I would like to communicate to people that we\u2019re just human beings like others and I am an artist who conveys a message. I was born in Japan, that was just a coincidence. I love Tokyo: it has taught me so much. I want to continue to draw Manga riding on a rainbow express train. M A Joy is a manga artist and illustrator working in Tokyo.
