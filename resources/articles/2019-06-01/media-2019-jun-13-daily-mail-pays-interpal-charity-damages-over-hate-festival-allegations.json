Associated Newspapers apologised unreservedly to the trustees of Interpal, which provides aid to Palestinians, for suggesting the registered charity was a terrorist organisation. The settlement, secured with the help of the law firm Carter-Ruck, a libel specialist, related to two articles published last August. The publisher accepted the charity did not fund or support a play depicting children murdering Jews, as the articles suggested. Interpal did donate money to the festival but as soon as the charity became aware of the play it issued an unequivocal condemnation. The second article, which appeared on the Mail Online website, referred to Interpal as a \u201cspecially designated global terrorist organisation\u201d. It failed to mention that this referred to a contested designation made by the George Bush administration in 2003, which the charity has always denied and for which the US has provided no evidence. The Charity Commission investigated Interpal following the designation but found no grounds to change its charitable status. The Daily Mail published a prominent correction in April and its publisher has now paid damages to the charity and its legal costs. The apology said: \u201cThe trustees assure us, and we accept, that neither Interpal, nor its trustees, have ever been involved in or provided support for terrorist activity of any kind. We apologise to the trustees for any distress caused.\u201d Ibrahim Hewitt, the chairman of Interpal\u2019s trustees, welcomed the settlement and the apology. He said: \u201cThe timing and amount of the settlement are particularly noteworthy within the context of the ongoing wider agenda to politicise humanitarian aid to Palestinians. We hope that this significant success will encourage commentators and others to take seriously their responsibility for reporting unbiased, accurate information to the general public and service providers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
