Addressing a small and enthusiastic audience at the SXSW festival, Obama told the 2,400 festival-goers, technologists, local politicians and media that the American constitution and bill of rights are a system designed to protect the public from government overreach. He said he could not directly comment on the battle between Apple and the FBI. \u201cI am way on the civil liberties side of this thing. I anguish a lot over the decisions we make to keep this country safe and do not want to overthrow the values that made our country safe simply for expediency,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut if everybody goes to their respective corners and says \u2018it\u2019s either perfect encryption or a big Orwellian world\u2019, then after something bad happens politics will swing into action and it will become sloppy and rushed through Congress in ways that are not thought through.\u201d Obama said the government had engaged the tech community \u201caggressively\u201d over the issue and concluded: \u201cFetishising our phones above every other value ... this notion that our data is different and can be walled off I think is incorrect.\u201d He also claimed that Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations had \u201cvastly overstated\u201d the dangers of spying, insisting that US intelligence agencies are \u201cscrupulous\u201d and that some of the excesses of agencies highlighted by Snowden have been fixed. \u201cWe are in a moment in history when technology, globalization and our economy are changing so fast, and this gathering, SXSW, brings together people who are at the cutting edge. \u201cThose changes offer us enormous opportunities but are also very disruptive and unsettling \u2013 they empower individuals to do things they could never dream before, but they also allow folks who are very dangerous to spread dangerous messages.\u201d Obama talked more broadly about the role of technology in government, speaking at length about community engagement including affordable internet access and online voting systems. \u201cIt is easier to order a pizza \u2026 than it is to exercise the single most important task in a democracy \u2013 to select who is to represent you in government.\u201d The tech industry has a role to play in stepping up to solve that challenge, he said. Government has to tackle harder problems than the private sector, Obama said, whether education, terrorism or homelessness. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get 100% perfect satisfaction the way you get the perfect latte. When a government does great things we take it for granted. \u2026 I could find the fiercest libertarian in the room but he\u2019d be checking the weather on his phone thanks to some government satellite. But that\u2019s not reported as \u2018government\u2019. \u201cIf there are those who despise government oftentimes it\u2019s because the absence of government allows them to pollute, or keep as much money as they can, or not answer consumers who are complaining about their practices.\u201d That the website of his administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t work was \u201ca little embarrassing for me\u201d, Obama conceded. \u201cI was the cool early adapter president, I ran my entire campaign on having cool technology and social media.\u201d He said he called in a \u201cSwat team\u201d from Silicon Valley and Austin to fix it but blamed a government procurement system designed for buying pencils, boots and furniture that doesn\u2019t work so well for software. Obama launched the Educate to Innovate project in 2009, which combined government initiatives with private sector projects and NGOs to improve science, maths and engineering education, especially among minority children. \u201cIf we join forces with the private sector there\u2019s no problem that isn\u2019t solveable. It\u2019s not enough to focus on the next big thing. It\u2019s how do we harness the next big thing to make sure that everybody in the country has an opportunity.\u201d One of the world\u2019s most influential arts festivals, SXSW has become one of the defining events for Austin, the state capital of Texas. Sometimes derided as San Francisco South, the city has built a reputation as a liberal bastion and centre for counter-culture in what is otherwise a staunchly conservative state. Texas led 26 other Republican-dominated states in opposing Obama\u2019s November 2015 executive order on immigration, which would enable 5 million undocumented migrants to work legally. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley leaders recently supported Obama\u2019s efforts on immigration, which resonated with an industry reliant on recruiting and often importing the world\u2019s best engineering talent. But most recently, the technology world has been focused on a battle between Apple and the FBI, which is using a federal court to try to force the company to help it access the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. The technology industry has almost unanimously backed Apple, even as the two sides have become increasingly acrimonious. Obama\u2019s appearance at the SXSW festival in Austin is a presidential first. More than 15,000 SXSW ticket-holders applied to a lottery to see the president, with 2,000 picked at random including Wesley Faulkner from the startup Namecheap, who turned up dressed as Waldo of Where\u2019s Waldo. \u201cHe\u2019s the last cool president,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at who\u2019s running for president on the Democrat and Republican side \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to hang out with any of them. Obama\u2019s relatable. He\u2019s on the same level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
