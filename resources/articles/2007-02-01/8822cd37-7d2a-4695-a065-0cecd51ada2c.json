One of my gripes was that there were no details about the closure on governornet or any other Department for Education and Skills (DfES) website. A discussion thread on the site was finally answered by a member of the schools e-communication team: \"As part of a government-wide web-rationalisation programme, a new website, schoolsweb, will replace the existing DfES websites for the schools audience. This includes teachernet, governornet and the standards site. The content of these existing sites will be consolidated into schoolsweb, thus reducing the number of websites users will need to visit to search and find information. \"The current websites will continue to exist until schoolsweb is up and running, which is expected to be later this year. Suggestions and comments for the discussion forums, or other suggestions for schoolsweb can be emailed to schools.web@dfes.gsi.gov.uk.\" So now we know where and approximately when, although it would also be interesting to know how much this technological revolution is going to cost. I hope this opportunity is used to streamline the enormous amount of written information governors are supposed to digest. There is surely the need - and the budget - to have someone working on the site who can prioritise and simplify reports, statistics, recommendations and consultations. An example of how useful this could be was illustrated a couple of weeks ago with the release of the 16th report of the school teachers' review body on pay. It was flagged up on governornet as \"high importance\" and the level was described as \"detailed\". Content included maths and science, special educational needs, the excellent teacher scheme, and performance pay and progression - all core issues for finance, personnel and curriculum committee members. A governornet link took readers to a very brief press release or to the report itself, which runs to 75 pages. It needed someone from the website to break down the report into manageable chunks and then flag up the big issues. The government has often said it wants people from more diverse backgrounds to volunteer. That may mean governors for whom English is not their first language, or parent-governors whose own education was poor. The drive to get more people from the business community to commit time to governance is being stalled by the vast amount of uncoordinated paperwork. \u00b7 Education.governor@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
