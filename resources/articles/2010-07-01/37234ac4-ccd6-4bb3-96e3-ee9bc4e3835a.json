My career didn't take off at first. I did some fringe stuff in Brussels. For a few years I did the annual \"conference season\", performing on stage in venues in Brighton and Blackpool. My big break really came in a three-part TV election drama when I completely outshone two much better-known performers. Offers of work came flooding in. I landed the co-starring role in a blockbuster production \u2013 The Coalition \u2013 with a guaranteed run of five years! Last week the star of the show went off for a US tour and I got to play the lead! It was in the Commons, Westminster's most prestigious theatre! But I fluffed my lines. Some people in the back rows were laughing. The reviews were dreadful. Have I blown it? N Clegg Dear Mr Clegg It is important to keep things in perspective. Although you are clearly impatient for top billing, your rise from relative obscurity has still been meteoric. It was inevitable that you'd come down to earth with a bump. The important thing is to learn from your recent setback and not let it undermine your confidence. You still have a big part as second lead in The Coalition. You should work on turning this role into something distinctive, rather than envying the star of the show his higher profile and better lines. And remember, people can change careers. You have clearly mastered the art of learning scripts at short notice and delivering the lines as if they were your own. That skill will stand you in good stead if you ever decide to give politics a go. Dear Dr Mander I am a patriot. I think Britain is great, except for it being overrun with immigrants, controlled by Brussels and weakened by the dilution of its snowy white gene pool. And don't get me started on all the gay kissing. Anyway, as a true Brit, you can imagine my pride at being invited to Buckingham Palace for tea. Just me, the Queen and a few thousand of her friends. But the sinister forces of the elitist multicultural Establishment took my invitation away. How dare they?! I'll show them. When I'm prime minister I'll get to see the Queen every week. On my own. So there! But banning me like that, it's against my human rights, isn't it? N Griffin Dear Mr Griffin This is a strong reaction to having missed a social engagement. Perhaps the rejection evokes some deeper anxiety about status and failure to be included. Have you perhaps struggled to make friends before, maybe at school or university? You express anger towards the Establishment, but it is unclear whether you want to destroy it or be accepted by it. This is a classic expression of adolescent neurosis \u2013 you crave participation in the adult world, but fear surrendering your childish egocentricity. The only mystery is how your arrested teenage angst led you into far-right politics when for most people it leads to self-indulgent rock music and ripped jeans. Perhaps it is a phase and you can still take the more traditional path to adulthood. Quit politics, retire to your bedroom, wear black eye makeup, get a facial piercing, listen to My Chemical Romance and wait for your neo-fascist urges to subside. Dear Dr Mander A few years ago I was jailed for fraud, which ended my brilliant career as a newspaper magnate and cost me a fortune. Now I am free again, what should I do? Lord C Black Dear Lord Black As a newspaper proprietor you presumably liked power without accountability. As a one-time convicted fraudster you probably liked making easy money off the backs of ordinary people. Clearly, you are destined to become a banker.
