Well, not torture, but close enough for me. For a week, this introvert would put social awkwardness to one side and live as an extrovert. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy meeting new people. I decline most party invitations and if I do go, I leave as soon as I can without causing offence. Sometimes I fantasise about doing what Princess Diana used to do when she wanted to lose friends \u2013 change her phone number. So the prospect of spending a week saying yes to every social engagement that came my way was about as appealing as a root canal treatment. But evidence shows that conquering your inner introversion can be good for your mental health. In a recently published study, researchers at the University of California asked 123 people to act as extroverts for a week. Participants were asked to be talkative, assertive and spontaneous in their daily interactions with other people. The following week, the same group was asked to act like introverts. The findings were remarkable. \u201cIt was the biggest effect we\u2019ve ever found in any of our studies,\u201d says Dr Sonja Lyubomirsky, the lead researcher. \u201cWhen people acted extrovert, they experienced more positive emotions and satisfaction. When they acted introvert, they experienced fewer positive emotions.\u201d She speculates that this is because, at heart, humans are social creatures. \u201cSocial relationships are inherently rewarding for us. We have a need to belong and to connect with each other.\u201d But how to do it? If there is one person to ask, it is Jessica Pan. In 2018, Pan spent a year as an extrovert and documented the experience in a memoir, Sorry I\u2019m Late, I Didn\u2019t Want to Come. \u201cYou won\u2019t die,\u201d Pan says. \u201cBut you are probably going to be exhausted by the end of the week.\u201d (Unlike extroverts, who draw energy from social encounters, introverts find them draining.) She advises me to steer clear of small talk, which is good, because I loathe it. \u201cIf you spend the whole week talking about the weather, I think you\u2019ll hate it.\u201d Instead, go deep and be vulnerable. \u201cShare something vulnerable about yourself, even if that seems terrifying. A person will match that normally and you will feel as if you\u2019re making a friend.\u201d Pan gives me a set of rules: no booze because it makes things easier, no taking a friend along for moral support \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s cheating!\u201d \u2013 and I must spend an hour and a half at each engagement, minimum. Here goes nothing. Monday I start the week by attending an Extinction Rebellion induction meeting. I have toyed with the idea of joining the movement for months, but put it off because none of my friends are members and the thought of going alone frightens me. In a chilly church hall, I take a seat in a circle of stacking chairs. There is a long pause while I steel myself to turn to the person next to me. \u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m Sirin.\u201d I start chatting to Ben, who has just moved into the area. He is a friendly bloke with a deep tan and a placid manner. Remembering Pan\u2019s advice, I offer something vulnerable about myself. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to come to these meetings for ages, but none of my friends wanted to come with me.\u201d My anxieties tumble out. \u201cAlso I eat meat and fly, and I\u2019m worried everyone here would judge me.\u201d Ben looks at me kindly. After the meeting, he waves at me from the church steps. I\u2019ll be back, I think. Tuesday This evening I am playing dodgeball with strangers and all I can think about is how much I don\u2019t want to do it. I was abysmal at team sports at school, and the thought of balls ricocheting around me feels like an anxiety dream. After checking the maximum velocity of a dodgeball (70mph), I panic and call Jacob, the Headshot United team coordinator, for some last-minute reassurance. \u201cWe\u2019re really bad,\u201d Jacob promises. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the last nine games. Besides, you can hide at the back. There will be a few people who wear knee pads and stuff like that \u2013 try not to worry about them.\u201d I catch up with Jacob and his teammate, Ed, for a pre-game drink. \u201cSomeone joined us last week and said they didn\u2019t have a good time and wouldn\u2019t be coming back,\u201d says Ed. I gulp. Jacob senses my anxiety. \u201cIf you really are hating it, you don\u2019t have to keep playing,\u201d he says. We head to a nearby school gym. Playing team sports with strangers was exactly like losing my virginity: not memorably awful, but definitely not good. I cringe every time a ball thuds my way and lack the strength to make my throws clear the other side of the court. Obviously, I get hit on the head. \u201cYou took that head shot like an absolute champ,\u201d observes a teammate. While I didn\u2019t enjoy dodgeball \u2013 hated it, if I\u2019m honest \u2013 I loved meeting everyone. After the game (we lost), I hit the pub with Jacob and his teammate Will. \u201cYou\u2019re not the worst newcomer we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Jacob says. He\u2019s definitely lying. Wednesday Today I am meeting up with Emma, whom I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to a Crossfit class \u2013 a famously social workout, where high fives, fist bumps and (God forbid) hugs with sweaty strangers are de rigueur. Emma introduces me to Rich, the owner of Crossfit Shapesmiths in south London. \u201cI\u2019M SO HAPPY TO MEET YOU,\u201d Rich bellows at me. \u201cCOME HERE FOR A HUG. COME HERE!\u201d We hug. \u201cHe\u2019s like that with everyone,\u201d Emma says. \u201cHe\u2019s just really happy.\u201d I meet JP, who will be leading the class. The workout flies by. Emma is a sweetheart. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great!\u201d she cheers, as I flub my way through some complicated moves involving a kettlebell. \u201cGood pace!\u201d After the class, JP instructs us \u2013 orders, really \u2013 to high five. Old Sirin would cringe at this enforced bonhomie, but new Sirin is all high fives. I\u2019m just happy I didn\u2019t get hit in the face. Thursday \u201cWhat is a weed?\u201d asks Cathy, the leader of Waltham Forest\u2019s volunteer gardening group, \u201cIt\u2019s a plant in the wrong place.\u201d The group meets every Thursday morning to tend the grounds behind the William Morris Gallery in east London. Looking round, I can relate. I have never gardened before and most of the people here are regulars. Being a newbie among outsiders, doing something I have never done before \u2013 not my favourite thing. My goodness, they are a friendly bunch. We yank out weeds and fling them into a pile. It is a beautiful morning, crisp and clear. I make friends with Judith, who is retired and lives locally. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, making friends in London,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can just walk up to people in the street. They\u2019d think you were a nutter.\u201d After a tea break, I\u2019m promoted to planting. I try not to look at the worms that tumble from my spade. \u201cI just fling the worms away,\u201d says Judith conspiratorially. We tuck the plants into the soil together, like children being put to bed. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back, won\u2019t you?\u201d says Judith. Friday I\u2019m flagging. Pan warned me I would be tired and she was right. If my life were a night out, right now I would be sitting in the smoking area, begging a friend to fetch my coat. The last thing I want to do is hang out with a stranger. On Bumble BFF, a friendship app, I start chatting to Radhika, 25, a student from Delhi. We meet up later at an audiovisual exhibition about the natural world. It\u2019s not the most successful meeting. Radhika is lovely, but it\u2019s not the sort of place where you can chat and it\u2019s awkward to be walking in silence with someone you have just met. As a result, Radhika and I never get past first base conversationally, which makes our interaction stilted, like kissing with braces. In the gallery, the sounds of the wilderness are compressed into a bright heartbeat of lasers. Radhika says she was homesick last week \u2013 it was the Diwali celebration. A few friends had had a gathering, but it wasn\u2019t the same. I feel guilty for co-opting her into my experiment. Moving to a new place on your own is hard. A lot of my anxiety around socialising is linked to the fact that I often feel responsible for making conversation, as I do today. The encounter was wearing, probably because I already felt drained. After the exhibition, I suggest a drink, but Radhika declines. I\u2019m relieved. Saturday I wake up with a ball of dread in my stomach that won\u2019t go away . Why? I\u2019m going to a Halloween party tonight, full of people I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019ll be flying solo. As evening approaches, the feeling intensifies. I desperately don\u2019t want to go and find myself tidying drawers and sorting laundry until I can\u2019t put off going any longer. Outside the house, I text Pan for some last-minute support. \u201cARGH I DON\u2019T WANT TO GO TO THIS PARTY ON MY OWN.\u201d She texts back. \u201cTalk to three people and if they suck, you can leave. Also, ask the host to introduce you to some people.\u201d I take a breath and ring the bell. Ordinarily, the hardest part of going to a party alone is walking in, not knowing anyone. In my case, it was realising once through the door that not only did I not know anyone, they were all in fancy dress. Luckily, the host Dan (not his real name) or, rather, Emperor Caligula \u2013 takes me under his wing. He introduces me to Gosia and Ula, sisters from Poland. Pan\u2019s tip to let myself be vulnerable definitely helps: I tell Gosia and Ula about my anxieties and they look after me all evening as carefully as if I were a baby bird. It\u2019s a great party. There is a severed head in the freezer and drinks are served in IV bags \u2013 but I\u2019m so tired after the week\u2019s exertions that I only last a few hours before making my excuses. \u201cYour costume was awful,\u201d Dan says, walking me to the door. Sunday I am comfortably the youngest person by a few decades on today\u2019s walk, which is organised by the London Strollers. It\u2019s no bother \u2013 one of the joys of my week of extroversion has been the opportunity to chat to older people. About 30 of us set off on a three-hour walk around north London. Things do not start off well. Although the woman I had been walking with seems friendly initially, she then makes a number of offensive comments. The thought of having to spend the morning listening to her fills me with a crushing ennui. I am already so tired. I don\u2019t think I can bear this. Then Elizabeth comes to my rescue. She is very tall and upright, a headscarf knotted under her chin \u2013 my knight in a green raincoat. We talk about everything. How she has just got into football and is learning Italian, which will be her sixth language. Her childhood in Finland, and the 40 years she spent as a nurse. (She retired five years ago, at the age of 70.) She tells me about her husband, a communist, who died. And her children, who also died. And why you should only marry someone with the same political views as yours \u2013 preferably a communist. \u201cSocialists, they sit on the fence,\u201d Elizabeth shrugs, striding up Primrose Hill. I loved meeting Elizabeth. I could have talked to her all day. I take her number and we make loose plans to go to a protest together. It\u2019s all over So what did I learn from my week of extroversion? That people are kinder than you think and it is often easier to be truthful with strangers. That you should open yourself up to new experiences because the worst that can happen is getting hit in the face with a dodgeball, and that is not so bad. That we are all of us individual moving dots, part of the same involuntary palpitating life, crisscrossing as we walk the streets. It\u2019s nice for the dots to collide sometimes, even for a little while. Strangers can come together and share their stories. We all have a story to tell. I\u2019m still an introvert and I don\u2019t see that changing soon. But perhaps you will see me a bit more from now on. Maybe. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 because an earlier version was wrong to describe the University of California research as \u201cthe first study of its kind\u201d.
