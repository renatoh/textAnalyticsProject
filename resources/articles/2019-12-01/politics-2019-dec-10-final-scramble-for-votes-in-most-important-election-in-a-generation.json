Both Labour and the Conservatives have branded Thursday\u2019s vote the \u201cmost important in a generation\u201d as the two sides have vastly different plans for Brexit and spending on public services. The prime minister was set to crisscross the country from Yorkshire to the Midlands, Wales and London on Wednesday, sending out his core message that the Conservatives need only another 12 seats to win a majority. Meanwhile, Corbyn will begin his day in Scotland and will visit at least five key seats in a whistlestop tour across England, calling for those who are undecided to \u201cvote for hope in this election\u201d. The Conservatives are leading by anywhere between six and 15 points according to the polls, which could mean anything from a comfortable majority for Johnson to a hung parliament. A detailed constituency-by-constituency poll published on Tuesday night predicted a Johnson majority, but much reduced compared with its previous set of results two weeks ago. Although the YouGov MRP poll put the Conservatives unchanged on 43% and Labour just two points up on 34%, when mapped on to all the UK\u2019s seats that resulted in the notional Tory majority falling from 68 to 28 as his party\u2019s seat count falls by 20 to 339, while Labour\u2019s improved by the same amount to 231. The survey is based on a large sample of more than 100,000 interviews conducted over the previous six days, but given the margin of error, a hung parliament cannot be ruled out. Johnson spent Tuesday in Staffordshire attempting to recover from a disastrous previous day, when he refused to look at a photo of a sick boy lying on the floor of a hospital in Leeds and his advisers then wrongly briefed that an aide had been punched. With polling stations due to open at 7am on Thursday, Corbyn will say it is time for people to vote for \u201ca Labour government that will be on your side; a Labour government that will save our NHS\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a pay rise for 12 million people, for lower fares and bills, and for free childcare,\u201d he will say in a speech in Middlesbrough in the north-east on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s time for pension justice for women born in the 1950s, and for free personal care for pensioners. And it\u2019s time for everyone to have free education and decent jobs. \u201cWe will put money in your pocket because you deserve it. The richest and big business will pay for it. We will save our NHS by giving it the money it needs, ending privatisation and by not selling it out to Trump.\u201d He will argue that Thursday\u2019s choice is the \u201cmost important election in a generation\u201d, in which people have the chance \u201cto vote for a government for the many, not the few\u201d. Johnson, who will start his day on a milk-round in Yorkshire at 7am, said the Tories could not be complacent about being ahead in the polls and said the election remained \u201cclose-fought\u201d. Asked at a campaign event in a JCB factory in Staffordshire whether the general election was \u201cin the bag\u201d, the prime minister insisted \u201cabsolutely not\u201d. \u201cThis is a very close-fought election, and we need every vote,\u201d he told his audience of factory workers at a carefully staged event. \u201cThe only mathematical alternative to a working majority for a Conservative government is the real, real risk of another hung parliament. That\u2019s another five years of confusion, chaos, dither and delay. We cannot go down that route.\u201d In an attempt to emphasise his point, he drove a union jack-emblazoned bulldozer through a wall of polystyrene blocks in a stunt for the TV cameras. He told JCB workers: \u201cWe\u2019ve only got 48 hours to get this thing done. I want you now to reflect on the gravity of the choice we have before us. This is a momentous occasion for our country. I\u2019ve never seen an election quite like it.\u201d Labour quickly countered with an edited version of the clip that made it look as if Johnson was tearing down the NHS. The prime minister also sought to exploit comments by the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, whose downbeat remarks about Labour\u2019s chances were leaked by a \u201cfriend\u201d. \u201cJon Ashworth made absolutely clear that he thinks the reason Mr Corbyn is failing to persuade large numbers of people to vote for him is he is blocking Brexit, he won\u2019t get Brexit done,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely right.\u201d In an apparent bid to reach out to voters who supported remain in 2017, he said: \u201cWe want to respect the will of the people. We\u2019re democrats. I mean, whether we\u2019re leavers or remainers, whichever way we voted, we\u2019ve come together and we want to get it done. We can; we\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d Johnson was accompanied by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, at the first of several stage-managed appearances as the Tories sought to get their campaign back on track for the final 48 hours. The prime minister was challenged on Monday over the photograph of a four-year-old boy, Jack Williment-Barr, sleeping on the floor of a Leeds hospital, and responded by pocketing the journalist\u2019s phone. And his aides were later accused of lying about an incident outside the same hospital involving an aide to the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Javid introduced the prime minister at JCB by warning that a Labour government would create an economic crisis by Christmas. \u201cCorbyn has a programme for government that is far left, that is the most anti-business, the most anti-enterprise, this country has ever seen. It will guarantee an economic crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cNormally a Labour government takes a few years to leave a crisis,\u201d he added. \u201cWith this lot, it won\u2019t be years; it won\u2019t be months; it won\u2019t even be weeks; it will be days. There will be a crisis by Christmas.\u201d The departure of the Conservatives\u2019 campaign battle bus from JCB was delayed because Extinction Rebellion protesters dressed as bees glued themselves to its windscreen \u2013 though Johnson himself left separately. Both party leaders will end the day with rallies for supporters in London. Johnson has returned continually to the Tories\u2019 \u201cget Brexit done\u201d slogan throughout the campaign, and he will make it number one of six final pledges to the electorate on Wednesday. Others, all familiar from the past six weeks, include implementing a points-based immigration system, and increasing NHS funding. The Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson will visit several target constituencies on Wednesday as she seeks to underline her party\u2019s anti-Brexit message."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
