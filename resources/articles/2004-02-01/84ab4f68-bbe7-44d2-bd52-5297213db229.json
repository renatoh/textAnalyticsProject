Tourbillon, whose name means whirlpool. Nothing could be more appropriate. His pretty Hotel du Poete at Fontaine-de-Vaucluse is a converted water mill with several channels of the River Sorgue rushing round the garden like Jacuzzis. 'You must go to the market at L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. All Provence will be there.' Thus, on a holiday morning last May, I was introduced to the most famous market in Provence. Even my husband was captivated; and the hours we spent on the quays of the pellucid, pea-green Sorgue, among stalls which sell everything from saucy thongs to serious antiques, glow in memory. We only bought one dashing denim hat (man's), some cheese and olive oil. Some of the stuff was very familiar: chains of lavender sachets, Provencal prints, bags of herbs, ceramic dishes for grating nutmeg and garlic, terracotta cookware, olive- wood salad bowls, not to mention a stupendous range of things to eat. But these stalls were sideshows, and didn't explain why the town seemed en f\u00eate. Huge amounts of al fresco cooking were going on, in mighty woks brimming with the makings of paella. Superior buskers patrolled the quays or set up camp beneath the plane trees: an exquisite flautist, a woman with a sound system and backing group who sang the street songs of Paris with Piaf's rasp in her voice, jugglers and stilt-walkers, 'living' statues. The sun shone, the river glittered, the crowds were cheerful and relaxed; no one hurried, no one pushed, the air was heady with wood smoke, lavender, herbs and food smells to swoon for. I began to think if I had one Sunday left to live I would spend it in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. And as we explored the boulevards off Quai Jean-Jaures we found the showcase avenues of its celebrity: antiques. I've since learnt more about the little town which gracefully receives the waters of the Sorgue after its violent exit from a headwall of the Vaucluse mountains at the famous fontaine . (The village of Fontaine-de-Vaucluse is one of the most visited in France, and if you stay there you must be prepared to share it with armies of weekend daytrippers.) L'Isle is nine miles from Fontaine and stands on the Comtadin plains about 20 miles east of Avignon. The river gave the town an industrial past which is now a picturesque present. There are sketchy similarities to Venice - it was built on piles driven into swamps in the twelfth century and has a modest canal system - but its sobriquet 'the Venice of Provence' is fanciful. The town has plenty of charm in its own right, and the old water wheels which once powered the production of wool and silk are now photo opportunities. Thirty years ago L'Isle found a new economic base. Its former warehouses and factories have been restored and turned into antique dealers' 'villages'. There are 250 dealers based in the town, and their numbers swell to around 1,000 during the annual antiques fairs at Easter and on 15 August. Where you find antiques you also find secondhand goods with ambitions to be antique, hoping some of the quality rubs off. The Sunday morning flea market is now the largest outside Paris. Fancy a felt hat as worn by the gardians of the Camargue? A metal sign saying Chemin Priv\u00e9 or Defense de Fumer? Some skewered butterflies in a glass case or an old flat iron? A colonial map of Afrique Nord? This is the place for you. Six months after my first visit I find myself an hour's drive from L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and go back. This time it's a grey day in autumn, and I worry that the magic may be dimmed. But I want to rediscover the festive Sunday atmosphere. First, a coffee in the fin-de-siecle Caf\u00e9 de France, in Place d'Eglise, where the flower market picks up business from churchgoers. Then a wander. Following the sound of live music (pipes, drums and strange. deep chanting) I find 10 Native Americans in feathers and fringed buckskins, performing circular dances to a rapt audience; troubadours taking their cue, no doubt, from the international success of Andean musicians. Time to consume. I buy three Ardeche saucissons, two baton du chevres, a collar of tiny crystals threaded on silver wire for my daughter, six fabric tablemats, two jars of tapenade, two tubs of Fleur de Sel de Camargue (crunchy sea salt like no other), a rope of garlic bulbs and a packet of five soaps spiked with verveine, orange blossom, vanilla, lavender and apple blossom. Total expenditure: \u20ac65.80, about \u00a346. Then, passing a stall of bric-a-brac, I feeI I ought to make some investment in L'Isle's reputation and pay \u20ac10 for a glass medicine bottle which may or may not be antique. But it's a pleasing little amber thing. Time for lunch. A pallid sun has appeared and it's warm enough to sit outside the Caf\u00e9 de la Sorgue on Quai Jean-Jaures, But this turns out to be a mistake. I'm surrounded by English voices, family parties who all seem to know each other: Peter Mayle wannabes from second homes in the Luberon. This didn't happen last time. A lesson has been learnt for all who prefer L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue at its most local; avoid half term and other British school holidays.
