There was good reason to suppose that White's international career was over when he took no part in the Test series against Sri Lanka this year or in the triangular one-day tournament against Sri Lanka and India. Injury, a loss of form and a decline in his pace as an attacking, reverse-swing change bowler, together with the fact that he will be 33 in December, raised doubts over a cricketer whose self-belief has sometimes faltered under pressure. White, though, has forced his way back after some outstanding recent performances, not least his man-of-the match double act for Yorkshire in Sunday's carried-over Cheltenham and Gloucester Trophy semi-final against Surrey. White was Yorkshire's most successful bowler with four for 35 then hit an unbeaten 78-ball hundred as he led Yorkshire to victory by 10 wickets. The previous day he had top-scored in a Norwich Union League match. But his revived international form was the main reason for yesterday's call-up. When he was brought back for the first Test against India at Lord's he responded with four wickets and a half-century in England's 170-run victory. Some had doubted whether his pace would ever return but he was clocked at a nippy 87mph. Now he has replaced Alex Tudor in the one-day party. \"My attitude has been good all season,\" he said. \"I've been positive and not worried too much when we have been beaten. Getting back in the Test side lifted my morale.\" The chairman of selectors, David Graveney, says there is still time for players to force their way into the World Cup reckoning. But the door, just ajar, is slowly creaking shut. Graveney said: \"This should not be read as the World Cup squad. We'll see how we perform in Sri Lanka and then make a decision after the first batch of one-day matches in Australia in December.\" He expects England's main injury doubts to be fit for Sri Lanka. Andy Caddick (rib), Darren Gough (knee) and Marcus Trescothick (broken thumb) have all been included in the squad for Colombo. In the ICC tournament England will play Zimbabwe on September 18 and India four days later. If they win their group, England will play the winners of the section containing Kenya, South Africa and West Indies in the semi-final. The final is on September 29."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
