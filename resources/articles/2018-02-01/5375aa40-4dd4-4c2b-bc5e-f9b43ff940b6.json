The title is \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Football\u201d and that\u2019s very clever if, presumably, it means that anyone who is impertinent enough to ask about the issues that have made the club international news can be shushed down by the people at the top table. A similar event was held in December 2016 and the chairman, John Bowler, began that one by making it clear it was a football\u2011only discussion. No awkward questions, thank you very much. No googlies thrown in. And no surprise, to be honest, if we go back to Barry Bennell\u2019s first convictions in England, in June 1998, and the following day\u2019s coverage in the Crewe Chronicle about his nine-year sentence. Crewe\u2019s reaction was contained in a single paragraph at the bottom of the page. \u201cThe Chronicle asked Crewe Alexandra to comment but were told that the chairman, John Bowler, was unavailable.\u201d And that, in a nutshell, is what we are dealing with here, sadly. Bowler did make himself available in May 2015 \u2013 exactly a week after Bennell was sentenced to another two-year stretch \u2013 when he went down to Buckingham Palace to receive an MBE for services to football and talked again about his pride, having joined the club in 1979, to have helped Dario Gradi build their youth system. Gradi had already been awarded an MBE and the two men were given the freedom of the borough in 2013 because they had \u201cchanged the way the world thinks about Crewe\u201d and \u201cnowadays the television and the newspapers talk about \u2018classy Crewe\u2019\u201d. Peter Kent, the leader of Crewe and Nantwich borough council, cannot ever have imagined when he came out with those words how they would look five years later. But in fairness, a lot of people might have thought the same given the number of column inches devoted to the club\u2019s production line and the absence of coverage when it first came out, almost a quarter of a century ago, that Gresty Road was actually football\u2019s house of horrors. Not, however, the players who had to suffer Bennell\u2019s depravity at the club he had wrapped round his little finger. One of his victims recalls being physically sick when he heard Gradi\u2019s MBE was recognition for Crewe\u2019s work with children. There is no suggestion Gradi knew boys were being abused but that player\u2019s story, in particular, makes it clear why he feels so aggrieved. \u201cBarry got me in one of the portable buildings where he had his office one day,\u201d he says. \u201cHe made me sit on his knee and he had his arms round me, stroking me. Dario walked in and inside my head I was screaming for help. I was 12. But he [Gradi] just carried on exactly as normal, going about his business.\u201d The club and Gradi did not respond when asked for their comment about these events. Gradi remains suspended by the Football Association from all football-related activities \u2013 though the governing body has never formally explained why \u2013 and has been accused of trying to \u201csmooth over\u201d a complaint of sexual assault from a 15-year-old boy against Eddie Heath, Chelsea\u2019s chief scout, in the 1970s. Gradi, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was in his 30s at the time and assistant manager at Stamford Bridge. Yet there are others at Crewe who should be facing questions about what they knew. Today, for example, I can report for the first time that the FA\u2019s independent inquiry has been told by one of the people giving evidence that Gill Palin, now retired but once a key member of staff, had many reservations about Bennell. Palin was once the longest-serving club secretary in the Football League and has been described as \u201cthe font of all knowledge\u201d at Gresty Road. The inquiry has been told she vehemently disliked the club\u2019s youth-team coach and expressed misgivings about his relationship with the boys. If Clive Sheldon, the QC overseeing the inquiry, hasn\u2019t already spoken to Palin, it should be a priority. Crewe\u2019s position is that they never knew anything was untoward until Bennell was arrested in Florida in 1994 and that he left the club for \u201cfootball-related reasons\u201d. Bennell, on the other hand, says it was because of a complaint. My information is that he was challenged by a number of parents after one training session and, within two days, was gone. That was in 1992 and it can also now be reported that on 29 May that year Gradi wrote to the parents of one boy from the centre of excellence. \u201cI do not want any of the boys who attended the centre to go to other coaching sessions or games organised by our former youth coach Barry Bennell,\u201d he states. \u201cIf this is going to cause you a problem then I will be pleased to talk to you about it personally.\u201d Gradi\u2019s office and home numbers are attached but there is no further explanation and he has not been willing to supply this newspaper with one, either. He, Bowler and Palin, as well as the club itself, have chosen not to comment after attempts were made to contact them by the Observer this past week. Unfortunately for Crewe, that still leaves plenty of questions when their former managing director Hamilton Smith has repeated his allegation that he warned the club about the man a judge has just called the \u201cdevil incarnate\u201d, and when you remember the account that Micky Fallon, one of the players who has just helped put Bennell back in prison, gave to the Guardian last weekend. \u201cI struggle to see how the people at Crewe didn\u2019t realise Barry Bennell was potentially a risk when he had all those children staying overnight and there was so much rumour and innuendo,\u201d was a standout line. \u201cBecause everybody else seemed to know.\u201d Crewe\u2019s kids, he recalled, were known to opponents as \u201cthe paedophile lads\u201d and there are many, many people who can back that up. Plus this feels like an appropriate time to recount a story I first wrote in late 2016 about Bennell being so notorious that one of Manchester\u2019s junior leagues was warned in 1990 that if he turned up on talent-spotting duties for Crewe he should be asked to leave and the police called if he refused. Gradi, of course, is on record saying there was \u201cnever any cause for concern\u201d. One guy I know, previously a Crewe fan, now tells me he is so ashamed of the club he is asking for his name to be removed from the brickwork of Gresty Road. Others have said they will demand answers from Bowler at Monday\u2019s event, no matter what he says about keeping it to football. There are plenty of decent Crewe fans who find it unfathomable \u2013 like many of us \u2013 the same regime is still in charge. Maybe Bowler could be directly asked why neither he nor Gradi, whose association with Crewe goes back to 1983, consider it a resignation matter. Perhaps someone could ask why the club still had team photographs featuring Bennell on their walls as recently as last February. And what, precisely, were the \u201cfootball-related reasons\u201d they claim were behind his departure? Perhaps it could be asked why Crewe\u2019s match-day announcer posted on Twitter in August that he was hopeful \u201call those shithead journos who tried to bury DG [Gradi] and our club could be heading for one hell of a kick in the bollox\u201d. Or maybe someone could raise the story of Andy Woodward\u2019s civil action against the club. Andy was one of the kids raped hundreds of times by Bennell. When the verdict went in favour of Crewe, he says the club\u2019s lawyers were high-fiving in front of him. Classy Crewe, indeed. As for the independent investigation Crewe announced 15 months ago, will anyone from the club be good enough to explain when, if ever, they are going to get round to it? Manchester City are a year into their one and, if nothing else, seem determined to shine a light on the club\u2019s darkest corners. The FA\u2019s inquiry is out later this year. It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable question: when do Crewe start theirs? More than anything, I do hope someone has the temerity to ask what the relevant people made of Hamilton Smith\u2019s allegations of a cover-up when he appeared on the Channel 4 documentary Football\u2019s Wall of Silence and stated unequivocally \u2013 just as he did to the Guardian in November 2016 \u2013 that he had told the club\u2019s directors, including Bowler, in the late 1980s about a specific complaint relating to Bennell. Smith left Crewe in 1990 and his account is that when he went to see Bowler years later, aggrieved that Bennell was now in prison and Crewe were still maintaining they had never received any warnings, the man sitting opposite him denied the initial conversation ever took place. Bowler, according to Smith, was a \u201clying bastard\u201d. And, despite repeated requests, the chairman of Crewe Alexandra has never responded to that allegation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
