A TV of the large screen variety. How passe! Possibly, were it not for its imposing dimensions. At 205in indisputably the biggest telly in the world - until probably next week, that is. Are you sure? At the electronics fest that is CeBIT last week, you couldn't escape the phrase \"world's first, biggest, smallest, fastest\", and the display manufacturers were all at it in force. Sharp showed what it termed the world's largest LCD screen, weighing in at an impressive 108in, while Samsung claimed the honours in the plasma class with its 102-inch monster. Place them alongside the Luxio, however, and they are small beer. Put the Luxio alongside that 28in TV you've got in the living room, moreover, and it's more than seven times the size. Why would I want one? You may have a 7,000sq-ft Georgian bolthole or a similar-sized loft dwelling whose expansive walls will seem bare without the addition of a four-and-a-half metre by two-and-a-half metre wall of LEDs. Or you may just love watching telly so much that you are prepared to shell out the cost of a gas-guzzling Porsche in order to watch 30 minutes of supersized Wags' Boutique or reruns of Land of the Giants in real size on DVD. What do I get then? A screen of such epic proportions that it will take at least four people to lift it. It is basically a cutdown version of what you might see at the Olympics or in any suitably sized sports stadium. It is based on the Italian company's Square Pixel technology, which essentially makes the screen appear to have four times the number of pixels and thus have a sharper image. When can I get one? When you have a) moved house and b) won the Lottery. If you have to ask the price, you know that you just can't afford one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
