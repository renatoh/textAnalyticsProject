I had hitherto thought this to be a surprisingly honest admission on the part of the wearers, rather than a fashion statement. I was raised, you see, with Arthur Ransome's maxim ringing in my ears: \"Better drowned than duffers. If not duffers won't drown,\" was Commander Walker's encouraging response to the suggestion that his children should go sailing on their own in Swallows and Amazons. But - having solved last week's prize puzzle by Taupi - I now realise that these hooded youths are part of a crack unit of crossword setters, specialising in anagrams. \"Sailor's shanty: 'MacDuff' (9)\"* was the clue. My son at the time was prancing about the living room with a plastic sword telling his sisters to \"Lay on, MacDuff\", and it took me a while to get past Macbeth and realise that what we were dealing with was an anagram. But was it legitimate? There is occasional debate in crossword circles as to whether clues such as \"Ancient Hindu in a jiffy (4)\"* in which the indicator - 'iffy' - is part of another word can be allowed. I'm in favour, but find it harder to answer the question of, \"How much movement/change must the word suggest to be a legitimate anagram indicator?\" In this case, I suppose \"pudding\" would be acceptable, especially as \"duff\" in this sense was a term commonly used by seamen, which gave the clue a nice symmetry. But \"duff\", I discover, has much more to offer than that, both as a noun and a verb. A duffer may duff his duff while sitting on duff covered in duff, which is to say a \"worthless fool\" may \"alter the appearance of\" his \"buttocks\" while sitting on \"a bed of decaying leaves\" covered in \"fine coal dust\". What a word! Best of all, in Australia it can mean to alter the branding on stolen cattle. Perhaps those young men are not crossword fanatics after all. * Answer 1 will appear in Monday's paper.
