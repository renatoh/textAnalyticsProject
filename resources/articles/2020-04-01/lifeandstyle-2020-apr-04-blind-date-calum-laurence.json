Flowing conversation. First impressions? A charming smile, a firm-ish handshake, and an electric blue coat. What did you talk about? The main topic of conversation was planning mistakes of the late 20th century (possibly I\u2019m at fault for that). Other topics included dysfunctional family units, attempting to be transcendental, and how Brighton was akin to a Christopher Isherwood novel. Any awkward moments? It was a tapas restaurant, so some awkwardness was born of that. Apart from that, everything seemed to flow fairly smoothly. Good table manners? No complaints. Kudos for navigating shared dishes. And he let me have the last bit of beef, which he found at the bottom of the dish, no less. Best thing about Laurence? Damn good at panic ordering \u2013 a skill I will never master. Would you introduce him to your friends? Sure. He\u2019s a nice guy. Describe Laurence in three words? London, funny, easy-to-talk-to. What do you think he made of you? Maybe a little bit too engrossed in the British planning system. Did you go on somewhere? After a prolonged wander, the nearest Wetherspoon was decided on. And... did you kiss? No. A fleeting hug on a wet street. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I wish I\u2019d ordered more food and drunk slightly less. Marks out of 10? A solid 7. Would you meet again? If our paths should cross, I\u2019d love to go for a coffee. As pals. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s on the same page. Laurence on Calum What were you hoping for? Someone with a few good tales to share over a bottle of wine. First impressions? Cool glasses. [He\u2019s not wearing them in our picture.] What did you talk about? His Uncle Jerry\u2019s funeral in the Orkney Isles, town planning, London\u2019s cocaine-addicted eels, and the bacterial structure of chlamydia. Any awkward moments? Wandering around in the pouring rain, trying to act as if I knew anywhere good to go on a Monday evening in March. Good table manners? Excellent! Best thing about Calum? Great stories, and friendly vibes. Would you introduce him to your friends? We didn\u2019t swap numbers. Describe Calum in three words? Intellectual, calm, friendly. What do you think he made of you? Loud, hopefully friendly and a mildly OK conversationalist. Did you go on somewhere? With my limited knowledge of Soho, he suggested a \u2019Spoon. And... did you kiss? No. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? A slightly less abrupt goodbye. I shouldn\u2019t have said \u201cciao\u201d. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? If we bumped into each other, I\u2019d ask about the sheep in Orkney. \u2022 Calum and Laurence ate at Ceviche, London W1. * This date took place before the UK government\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown. Self-isolation doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop looking for love, and Blind Date will continue with online video dates.
