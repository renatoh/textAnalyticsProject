Rubie, who accused Liverpool of \u201cmentally bullying\u201d his client Bobby Duncan before the England youth forward\u2019s move to Fiorentina in September, has been suspended from all \u201cintermediary activities\u201d until 15 January after being found guilty of two breaches of the FA\u2019s rule E3 by an independent regulatory commission. He will also have to attend an FA education programme for improper use of social media within four months, with failure to do so leading to a potential further ban. The commission\u2019s written reasons behind the sanctions have now been released and they reveal his ban relates to two tweets he posted in the space of 12 months. The first, in July 2018, related to Johnson, the former England player who was convicted of sexual activity with a child and sentenced to six years in prison in 2016 before being released in March. \u201cI think it is an utter disgrace that Adam Johnson got time in the first place. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t made a mistake similar to his?\u201d wrote Rubie, followed by three \u201ccrying with laughter\u201d emojis. In his defence, the agent denied the charge and claimed he had been joking. \u201cWhat was in fact being presented by the tweet was the direct opposite of what it said: Saif Rubie had experience through his ownership of a nightclub in Dubai of men making sexual advances towards underage girls who were often made up to look older. It was his view that Mr Johnson was rightly punished and that is what the tweet was intended to convey.\u201d The second tweet was posted in response to his friend and former Brighton and Swansea striker Leon Knight on 2 July, a few hours after England\u2019s defeat to the USA in the semi-finals of the Women\u2019s World Cup in France. It read: \u201c@knightie82 DON\u2019T WORRY LADS THEY\u2019RE COMING HOME,\u201d accompanied by four emojis of monkeys covering their eyes and featuring a photograph of a sink full of dirty dishes. Despite Rubie\u2019s claim he was referring to a conversation he had with Knight about the fact that his male Filipino cleaner was often late or absent \u2013 therefore leaving Rubie\u2019s apartment in disorder \u2013 the commission found both charges proved. \u201cThis was because of the nature of the tweets \u2013 in particular one being aggravated by implied reference to gender \u2013 and the fact that Saif Rubie has previously been warned about a comment he posted,\u201d read the report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
