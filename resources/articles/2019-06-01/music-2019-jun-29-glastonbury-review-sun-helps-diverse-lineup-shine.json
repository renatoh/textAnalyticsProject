Still, it\u2019s always better to wilt than to drip because sunshine magnifies the potential of any artist. When the Proclaimers opened the Pyramid stage on Saturday with songs as benevolent and beloved as I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles) and Sunshine on Leith, the field was already one giant open goal. The previous day the weather was a good friend to two very different exporters of Californian good vibes. Glowing with professionalism, Sheryl Crow was \u201cHow y\u2019all feeling out there?\u201d in physical form while Mac DeMarco\u2019s hungover ruminations were even more ragged and idiosyncratic than they are on record. Rain would have hobbled both of them. The fact that two out of three Pyramid headliners are white rock bands is a misleading anomaly on Glastonbury\u2019s most diverse bill yet, with many American stars materialising at Worthy Farm for the first time. Lauryn Hill led a faultless band through her first and only album, 1998\u2019s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, but appeared to be distracted by a long war of hand gestures with the sound technician, with the result that a slick performance of a classic album somehow failed to connect. Far more inviting was Michael Kiwanuka, who managed to tap into everything great about 70s soul without ever straying into pastiche. His band\u2019s disco-flavoured expansion of Black Man in a White World was an extraordinary alloy of indignation and joy. There\u2019s no substitute for the palpable delight of artists who have waited years for their big Glastonbury moment. Outgrowing their mid-afternoon billing, Bastille played as if they were headliners, bringing along backing singers, a brass section and guest star Lewis Capaldi. Frontman Dan Smith proclaimed their set \u201cour favourite gig ever\u201d, before a packed field sang Pompeii back to him. Joe Talbot from Idles went one better by sinking to his knees sobbing with emotion at the Park. The Bristol punk band draw their life-or-death intensity from their refusal to hold anything back. When Talbot talked about coming to Glastonbury at a low point in his life, to be part of something bigger, the crowd rallied around him, making for a cathartic, unforgettable performance. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited our whole lives to do this,\u201d he said with hoarse conviction. Fast-tracked to superstardom, Stormzy\u2019s status as Glastonbury\u2019s first black British headliner alone would have made his set a landmark, but he transcended all expectations. Headlining the Pyramid stage on Friday night, his opening salvo of politically charged grime, lit up by lasers and jets of flame, was merely the first act of a beautifully structured set, full of surprises. What began with one man on stage \u2013 in a union jack stab vest designed by Banksy \u2013 steadily blossomed into a multifaceted celebration of black British life, adding musicians, gospel singers, ballet dancers, BMX riders and \u2013 a curveball, this \u2013 Chris Martin from Coldplay. Even as the 25-year-old MC grinningly declared it \u201cthe most legendary night of my entire life,\u201d it wasn\u2019t a triumph for him alone. By inviting Dave and Fredo to perform Funky Friday, their landmark rap number one from last year, or reeling off a list of pretty much every MC in Britain, he was symbolically bringing everybody else with him. It was Stormzy\u2019s generosity as much as his ambition and energy that put this in the same league as Jay-Z\u2019s 2008 headliner, which brought hip-hop to the Pyramid stage, and even Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fabled Coachella sets. It is one thing to deliver an exceptionally crafted performance without a dull moment; it\u2019s quite another to use your platform to champion a whole culture. Historic and then some."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
