This provides them with passing angles wide as well as forward. Whenever Rio Ferdinand or Nemanja Vidic gains unchallenged possession, the full-back on whose side play is developing will get close to the touchline. For example, Patrice Evra might receive and, if he is blocked, transfer the ball swiftly back inside, from where United will switch it right. This makes it almost impossible for a lone striker to close down the defenders. Expect whoever is on the left of Chelsea's front three to be aware of United moving the ball out; when Didier Drogba tries to close down on the ball, they will react. United enjoy playing from deep, although Chelsea will not be overly unhappy about that. They will retreat and wait to counter swiftly. 2) Give Cristiano Ronaldo the ball The Premier League champions will look to play the ball to the Portuguese at every opportunity. Likely to start wide, Ronaldo will attract close marking and cover. He will need the ball early. Ronaldo can get frustrated but, provided he does not overdo the dribbling, United have an outlet which would scare most teams. The tighter Ashley Cole gets to him, the more space develops inside and the full-back has to come off cover that bit quicker. Chelsea are unlikely to follow Ronaldo deep if he goes searching for the ball - his danger is primarily from advanced positions. United must hope that their Portuguese star is calm, not irritated, and is fully focused on his own strengths, attacking his immediate opponent. Then he must be aware of slipping the next pass to a colleague, as a cover man will be ready to pounce. 3) Keep T\u00e9vez and Rooney in tandem Carlos T\u00e9vez and Wayne Rooney have worked prodigiously all season. These two both seek the ball, yet one would not label T\u00e9vez an out-and-out pin man, foraging down the channels, any more than Rooney. Neither has the height to unsettle centre-halves in the air. What they do have is an appetite for combining in areas where centre-backs fear to tread. John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho are highly competent, so Rooney will go a-wandering, as indeed will T\u00e9vez, working to create openings. At Wigan, when Rooney slipped Ryan Giggs in for the decisive goal, T\u00e9vez had opened up the space. It is that type of movement that keeps United in full flow. Both strikers are stronger on their right, so they will have to work hard to get the ball on to their better foot. But, if either is allowed to run at the defence, United will capitalise. For Chelsea to win they must put faith in energy, strength and movement. 1) Michael Essien's energy It is likely that Avram Grant will utilise greatly energetic midfielder at right-back from the start, thus allowing Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack to work with Claude Makelele. Essien has had to curb the overly aggressive instincts which made him an unpopular player when he first arrived in England, yet his quality is obvious. Once winning the ball, he can move before his opponents recover and those speedy first few yards can transfer defence into attack, crucially at pace. If he can gain possession in the midfield third, he will give United a problem as their wide left player would have to spend his energy retreating. Chelsea need Essien to support attacks at every chance. To do this they will need to pass accurately and speedily. Only with good ball retention will Essien be able to push on. 2) Tap into Didier Drogba's strengths The centre-forward needs a good supply line and fair support to flourish. He has tremendous volleying technique and his ability to turn in one swift movement and shoot with little back-lift is a goalkeeper's nightmare. Heading, too, is a strength that United will be more than aware of as Drogba is a willing target for Petr Cech to find with accurate kicks from hand. He will run down the channels, attempting to bully Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic in the United defence. Hopefully he will not be irritatingly theatrical; the referee will not tolerate any play-acting. One recalls Drogba's magnificent rampaging displays for Marseille en route to the Uefa Cup final four years ago. He was outstanding and inspirational then. If he repeats that form, he may prove to be the difference between these sides. 3) Michael Ballack's movement Ballack has taken months to emerge and confound any doubters at Stamford Bridge. He has now done that, much to the delight of the owner, Roman Abramovich. Signed for no capital outlay, he was the Bosman jewel but, of course, he gained a huge salary and there was frustration to be had in his difficulty in adjusting to the pace of the game in England. It similarly appeared that there was little compatibility with Lampard. In time, however, they have proved that talented players can complement each other, particularly if they are under-pinned by Makelele's strong support. This tall, strolling menace, arriving in the box and heading so aggressively, cost United a goal in the recent Premier League meeting at Stamford Bridge. Michael Carrick, particularly, will have to be aware of Ballack's late runs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
