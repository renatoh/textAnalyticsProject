Their tragedy encapsulates the immigration crisis", "bodyText": "When \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez told his mother that he was planning to take his wife and young daughter from their home on the outskirts of the San Salvador and head north to the United States, she felt a shiver of foreboding. \u201cI had a feeling,\u201d said Rosa Ram\u00edrez, 46. \u201cAn ugly premonition.\u201d But \u00d3scar was eager to follow his dream of a better future for his wife Tania Vanessa \u00c1valos, 21, and their 23-month-old daughter Angie Valeria. The family set out in April, heading for Mexico. \u201cI told him to take it step by step,\u201d Ram\u00edrez told the Guardian. \u201cBut he got impatient.\u201d Twelve weeks later, \u00d3scar and Angie Valeria drowned in each other\u2019s arms as they attempted to cross the Rio Grande and reach US soil. A harrowing photograph of the two bodies lying in shallow water cast a harsh spotlight on the region\u2019s migration crisis, and once again underlined the dangers facing families seeking to escape poverty, violence and corruption in Central America. Pope Francis expressed his \u201cimmense sadness\u201d at the accident, while in the US, the image turned up the heat on a bitter partisan debate over immigration. Back at the family\u2019s neatly painted brick house, Ram\u00edrez was left struggling with her loss. \u201cI feel a huge emptiness,\u201d she said. A purple stuffed monkey and baby doll that belonged Angie Valeria still lay on a chair in the living room. The last time she spoke to \u00d3scar was on Saturday, when he called from Mexico. He told her he was fine \u2013 as he had in every phone call since they set out. In retrospect, she wonders if he said so only to calm her worries. The next morning the couple arrived in Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, where they attempted to seek asylum at the port of entry. They were turned away and decided to cross the river which divides Mexico from the US. \u00d3scar crossed first with Angie Valeria, then turned back to help \u00c1valos, but the little girl followed him into the water; \u00d3scar tried to save her, but the current swept them both away. They were found on Monday, just half a mile (1km) from an international bridge, Valeria tucked inside her father\u2019s T-shirt \u2013 presumably in an attempt to stay together. For Ram\u00edrez, the photograph is a source of pain but also a measure of comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2026 that image. But at the same time, it fills me with tenderness. I feel so many things, because at no time did he let go of her.\u201d \u201cYou can see how he protected her,\u201d she told the Associated Press. \u201cThey died in each other\u2019s arms.\u201d Relatives and neighbours remembered \u00d3scar as a young man who was dedicated to his role as a father and husband. Unlike many Salvadoran migrants, his decision to migrate was not prompted by the rampant criminality which besets this Central American country. Altamira, the neighbourhood where \u00d3scar and Tania lived, is dominated by a street gang, but locals said that violence had somewhat decreased in recent months. Both parents had jobs \u2013 \u00d3scar had a minimum-wage job at a pizzeria, while \u00c1valos worked as a cashier in a fast-food restaurant \u2013 but the two incomes were just not enough for them to buy a place of their own. \u201cThey went looking for a better life and then this tragedy happened,\u201d said Cecilia Rodr\u00edguez, 23, who sells tortillas near the family\u2019s house. \u00d3scar was a regular customer, and would often bring his daughter with him. At 23 months, Angie Valeria still didn\u2019t talk much, but she was always laughing, Rodriguez said. \u201cWhen he was off work, I saw that he was always here with his family,\u201d she said. Mois\u00e9s G\u00f3mez was a childhood friend of \u00d3scar\u2019s; as boys they had spent their time watching videos and listening to music, although the two had seen much less of each other since Angie Valeria\u2019s birth. \u201cI felt bad when I heard,\u201d said G\u00f3mez, 22. \u201cHe was a friend all my life, so it hurt. And his daughter was so young.\u201d \u201cWe never thought this would happen,\u201d said neighbor Marta Argueta de Andrade, 63, who said Angie Valeria would often stand on the family\u2019s couch propped against the window so that she could wave to Argueta. Argueta always saw father and daughter together, usually going on walks to the store. \u201cMaybe they should have stayed \u2013 but no one knows that when they leave,\u201d she said. Argueta said that recently her grandson, who just turned 21, has also been thinking of migrating to the US. \u201cSo many leave here because of the desperation and poverty. They can\u2019t find work,\u201d she said. Young men are particularly vulnerable in the gang-controlled neighborhood. \u201cYou hear that they\u2019ve killed one person and then another and it makes you scared,\u201d Argueta said. But now she is just as worried for her grandson to try to go to the US. \u201cWith the tragedy that has happened, I would tell him that he shouldn\u2019t go,\u201d she said. G\u00f3mez said he had also been considering leaving for the US. \u201cI\u2019ve always had the dream of going to the US. and coming back to buy a house and making sure that my mom doesn\u2019t lack anything,\u201d said G\u00f3mez. \u201cBut after seeing the suffering of this family, not any more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
