Do Channel 4 think cold-hearted violence only appeals to young people rolling in from the pub? It certainly caught the attention, with its pair of psychopaths \u2013 one a brutish potato of a man with a gun, the other, his cooler partner (modish suit, white shoes), with a liking, as we later discovered, for taking a person's eye out with a teaspoon. \"Where is Jessica Hyde?\" they kept asking. \"I don't know\" was invariably very much the wrong answer. The McGuffin of the piece was an unpublished manuscript, supposedly destroyed, but forming the second part of a dark, cultish graphic novel embedded with myths and secrets of the sort that attract impressionable minds to dark, cultish website forums. It wasn't long before three young chatroom acquaintances found themselves tumbling together in bloody jeopardy. There was a fourth, soon dead (pushed off his own balcony), and a fifth on the run \u2013 a slippery school truant with a junkie mother and advanced burglary skills. Meanwhile a radio burbled with news of food riots abroad while Russian whore-traffickers sweated a civil servant to get valuable vaccine procurement contracts. Jessica Hyde dramatically turned up at the precise moment that we'd forgotten about her. It would be madness to detail every intricacy of this vivid entertainment (though don't think I couldn't), except to say that no one pleasant was safe and that the tentacles of an evil organisation seemed busy tweaking every organ of the state. Suffice it to say, the hour sped by. The central characters slotted well together and felt grounded in lives beyond the demands of the story. James Fox and Stephen Rea popped up pleasingly as languid villains. Jokes worked. The writing was deft and the direction stylish without being showy. Perhaps the eye-torture scene could have done with a little less chilli, but what would you rather have on a miserable Tuesday night in January \u2013 Huw with the latest on horse DNA and the turmoil in Pakistan? Are you interested in trains? No, neither am I, unless I have been waiting 20 minutes for one. But here was Dan Snow chuffing for Britain in Locomotion, which may do for the story of railways over the next three weeks what Mary Poppins did for tidying the house \u2013 ie make it not seem like hard work. What larks with the drawers opening and shutting on their own and clothes folding themselves and jumping into your arms! But can railways be larks? Dan was admirably determined to do the whole programme without gaudiness or visual trickery (though he did, inexplicably, fire a revolver in the opening sequence), relying rather on force of personality, as he pored over old maps or gazed longingly at flickering departure boards. Would we, as he did, see King's Cross station as the start of a grand romantic adventure? Even with its recent makeover and enhanced retail and lunching opportunities, that seemed unlikely. On the other hand, it wasn't hard to be persuaded that a train was better than a horse if you wanted to get to Edinburgh quickly or better than a boat if you wanted to haul coal to the furnaces of Britain's blazing new Industrial Revolution. It was interesting to have Dan colour in the historical detail between pulling carts along a wooden track (the early \"wagonways\" that brought coal from pithead to river) and the steam locomotives later dreamed up by George Stephenson, culminating in the celebrated Rocket (designed with crowd-startling oomph by his son, Robert). Subliterates will be heartened to learn that Stephenson, who could barely read or write, not only invented proper trains but saw the necessity for platforms and tunnels and ways of laying track across acres of bog \u2013 as he had to do for the Manchester to Liverpool line, which finally opened in 1830 after years of opposition from landowners and people who turned their noses up at progress, with its filth and disruption of quiet, leafy lives. It was not all glory. I felt for the local MP who had vigorously championed the railway but then stepped off the train on its first day and got killed by one coming in the other direction. And Dan gave us a great segment about the thousands of navvies who worked like beasts and lived in mud huts. A good one could shift 20 tons of muck a day. And what thanks did they get? Low pay, hostility from local residents and in all likelihood an early grave. No wonder they liked a drink. Funny Business, narrated by Radio 4 newsman Eddie Mair, showed us what comedians were doing when they weren't monopolising television \u2013 to wit selling their souls at lucrative corporate dinners. Here was the menu \u2013 half an hour of Michael McIntyre for \u00a340,000, Ricky Gervais for \u00a325,000. Lesser lights got less, but how could you resist? You were right there in the shop window prostituting your art. One lavish event, the Real Variety Show, with its audience of hardnosed business types, could land you 30 other corporate gigs. Jo Brand and Arthur Smith bared their shame but took the money. Everyone had experience of being ignored on stage. Rhod Gilbert was visibly distressed as he relived the night he found himself talking to the back of Sir Alex Ferguson's head at a footballers' beano in Mayfair. It was revealing but long-winded, and I found myself wondering how much Eddie Mair was getting paid as we drifted into the overvisited realm of vintage advertising with its (yawn) clips of Fry and Laurie selling cigars and John Cleese being zany in the service of Schweppes. \"Wherever you look now, money's spoiled it,\" said Cleese from his Monte Carlo apartment. A pig eating cake was the most amusing thing about BBC1's Sunday teatime comedy Blandings, which can't have been the intention of PG Wodehouse, whose tales of upper-class twittery inspired this waste of half an hour. Timothy Spall gave good drawl as eccentric Lord Emsworth and Mark Williams was as solid as you'd expect as the long-suffering butler; but civilisation has come too far to put trouserless yokels cavorting on a table in the hope of laughter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
