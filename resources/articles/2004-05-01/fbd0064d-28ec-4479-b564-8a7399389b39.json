He scored 88 against them for MCC at Lord's at the start of the season but had not reached fifty since until he made an unbeaten 147 yesterday. The previous highest score of his career was 135. This was his first century since the 107 he scored against Sussex at Edgbaston last May, his only century of the summer and his first since 2001. When Warwickshire's director of coaching John Inverarity, a former maths teacher, was asked about him he looked startled, as if he had discovered a pupil's frog among his quadratic equations. \"Oh, I don't want to say anything that might increase the burden of expectation on the young player,\" he said. But Inverarity missed the point; there is no burden of expectation on Bell these days. The gifted young man of three years ago has been overtaken by many others. At 22 he can make his second coming in his own time. The bugles are silent. He played Mushtaq Ahmed, the bearded little mesmerist, with patient care until he had reached three figures. Brad Hogg, with whom he almost doubled the score in adding 145 for the sixth wicket, including a five-run penalty for ball tampering (culprit unidentified), was more aggressive against the spinners, hitting 68 before he was caught at slip off the wicketkeeper's gloves. Mushtaq bowled beautifully on a slow turner, ripping out Jim Troughton's leg stump with a fast leg-break before having Dougie Brown taken at silly point. Warwickshire have won a big toss, for scores dwindle on these pretty acres."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
