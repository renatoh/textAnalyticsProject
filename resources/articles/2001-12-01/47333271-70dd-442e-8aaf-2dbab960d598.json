The day after the referee Neale Barry's comments on these pages last week about the recent 'evil' match between Leeds United and Aston Villa that he had tried to control, the Leeds chairman, Peter Ridsdale, cranked the full force of his club and his own standing in the game into operation. There was a call to Philip Don, the manager of the Premiership's elite group of 24 referees to complain. Ridsdale also had a word with the FA's chief executive, Adam Crozier, and the Premier League's equivalent, Richard Scudamore, to wonder if this sort of thing should be allowed. The matter was then raised again on Wednesday at the meeting of Premiership chairmen, which was ostensibly called to discuss the proposed Phoenix League. Ridsdale received some support from another big club in Arsenal, but Villa and West Ham, some of whose players' behaviour was also questioned during the refereeing summit that Observer Sport sat in on, have not responded. A spokesman for the Professional Game Match Officials Board, meanwhile, issued a statement. 'It was disappointing to see such personal comments, made at a private meeting, revealed in this way,' he said. Curious in this country, isn't it, how we fight for free speech, except when it exposes us; where an MP will feel he has to cross the floor because he is being bullied for speaking his mind? Curious how we investigate the process by which information is revealed rather than examine the merit of the information? And curious how football clubs, mainly through their managers, can criticise referees then cry foul when the tables are turned. I had asked some time ago to attend one of the new fortnightly refereeing get-togethers and Don, keen to show the workings of his group, agreed. When I turned up on the day, never was it even suggested that anything was 'private'. Indeed, when Barry made his remarks, there was also a BBC camera on him and a Talksport radio microphone in his face. Now, I do not believe that journalists should go around suing people but for one whose reputation is based on the trust of his contacts, the Premier League's statement about revealing private matters is certainly damaging and surely actionable. Barry, I understand, was upset that my report was 'personalised', yet others were also quoted, including, on the subject of Leeds, Graham Poll. And while other referees' performances were analysed, almost half the session was devoted by Don and his colleague Keith Hackett to the Leeds-Villa game. In fact, my belief was that this was exactly the kind of material the referees wanted airing, being a rare chance for them to get their points across. It now smacks of the politician's standby when loading guns for the press and expecting them to fire the bullets: 'You may say that, but I couldn't possibly comment...' Quite apart from any controversy, however, the real argument is that this is exactly the sort of material that should be aired. The message rather than the messenger is the story. The day after sitting in on the session, I telephoned a Villa player to tell him of the nasty video clips of the Leeds game I had seen. 'Did they show Bakke's tackle from behind on me?' he wondered. I said they had not. 'I suppose it was well down the list,' he replied. 'But that's Leeds, isn't it? They try to bully you out of it.' So it is not just referees who believe as much. Enough is being said elsewhere about some of the off-field activities in Leeds, and there is no more desire to kick them while they are down, so let us confine ourselves here to matters on it. They will hate it at Elland Road, where it is the topic that dare not speak its name, but no matter how much they cup their hands over their ears, echoes of some of the excesses of the 1970s are growing louder. It was first noticed here at the start of David O'Leary's first full season as manager two years ago. At Tottenham, Alan Smith was involved in an off-the-ball incident with Mauricio Taricco. It was difficult to see whether Smith should have been sent off. It was not difficult to see, or hear, that he had been swearing, face contorted, all afternoon at the assistant referee who had the casting vote in the dismissal. Assistants are human too; the unthinking Smith's attitude was bound to count against him. Last season, Leeds looked to have caught the vibrant mood that has brought Manchester United and Arsenal so much success and so many plaudits as they marched on together through the Champions League. Thrilling it was to watch, too. This season, though, has seen a regression to what always seemed latent behaviour. There was the intent-sounding game at Arsenal in the season's first week, when Lee Bowyer and Danny Mills, who also kicked the ball at a prostrate, injured player, were shown in close-up swearing at referees. Then came Smith's sending off against Villa, when he was 'hissing and snarling' at Barry, whose position you could only sympathise with when you saw the clips of what he had to deal with. Now O'Leary, an elegant defender in the mould of Rio Ferdinand, is an urbane man in public. He was never associated, when an Arsenal player, with some of their excesses of the late 1980s and early 1990s but was a managerial disciple of George Graham, similarly velvet glove in public but iron fist in private. O'Leary has said that he is working to control Smith but Poll last week noticed how he had been 'winding up' Smith before the recent game at Fulham. O'Leary clearly has in Ridsdale a kindred spirit. The chairman handled the whole affair in Istanbul when two Leeds fans were stabbed to death with commendable dignity and has the good grace, apparently, to be moderately embarrassed about a newly released video of his life at Leeds. Given his attack on the messenger rather than the message, you can only guess at what is said behind closed doors, however. 'They won't win anything playing like that,' the Villa player also told me. And that pragmatic argument, if not the more principled one about fair play and standards of behaviour to set an example to young players, should be one for Leeds to heed. The game has moved on since the 1970s. The laws have changed and, rightly, are more rigorously applied. Suspensions will undermine challenges for honours, along with injuries that can sometimes be caused by opponents perceiving a need to match fire with fire. The winning teams are those who recognise the new climate. And Leeds do have the exciting talent to realise it. The attack on this journalist matters not - he is big, old and ugly enough to view it as an occupational hazard in the knockabout world of football - though he will fight legitimately for his reputation and integrity when used amid wrangles by clubs, Premier League, FA and referees. And therein is an example of politics in the game: the \u00a34.6 million deal to fund the referees' new programme of professionalism comes from the Premier League (40 per cent), the Football League (40 per cent) and the FA (20 per cent) and the referees are concerned about biting the hand that feeds them. The need in future financing arrangements would seem to be to give them greater independence. Perhaps the saddest result of this whole affair is that Don has now stopped the media attending the get-togethers of referees, many of whom would dearly like to be allowed to give their response when criticised by managers. So is shown another curious aspect of football's 'democracy'. An informed debate about reckless tackles, diving and other issues was in process. The reaction is to suppress it. Except it won't be, not here at least. If referees are going to backtrack and the game's authorities going to cave in when clubs flex muscles, then it falls to the rest of us who believe in the goodness in the game, and the good of it, to highlight these issues and speak out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
