Scientists from the Nordic Cochrane Collaboration argue that up to a third of women who go for breast screening are over-diagnosed and over-treated. Their evidence comes from a large Swedish trial, the findings of which were the justification for the launch of the NHS screening programme. Per-Henrik Zahl and others, publishing in the Lancet Oncology journal, compare the numbers of cancers found in two similar groups of women, aged 40 to 69, over the course of six years. One group was screened every two years. The other group was screened only after six years. Zahl and colleagues say the numbers of cancers would be expected to be the same, but they were not. Around a third more cancers were found in the screened group. There must have been similar numbers of early-stage tumours in the unscreened group, but they must have regressed, the authors say. Zahl said it is not unknown or even unusual for cancer to regress. It happens with neuroblastoma in infants, for instance. A mass screening programme in Japan of babies under six months old was halted in 2004 when it was realised that too many were being needlessly diagnosed and treated, with no effect on the death rate. Before screening \u2013 which led to the treatment of every detected case \u2013 regression in breast cancer was known too, he said. \"If you go back in history there are many examples of breast cancer that have regressed, said Zahl. \"It has been observed. In animal studies it is very frequent.\" But these days evidence is harder to find, as doctors could be held liable if they failed to treat a patient who became very ill or died. \"People usually don't publish cancers that go into regression,\" he said. The authors argue that the detection of a tiny lump at mammogram should not necessarily lead to immediate surgery. The woman could instead be given a needle biopsy and a course of drugs and kept under observation to see whether the tumour stopped growing or disappeared altogether. Mette Kalager, from the Harvard School of Public Health, says in a commentary in the journal that the suggestion breast cancer may regress will seem provocative to some people. \"However, the authors argue convincingly that no other factors, such as differences in baseline risk of breast cancer in the two groups, attendance to mammography screening, or screening sensitivity, can explain their finding.\" She added: \"The problem with over-diagnosis is that women are treated as patients despite there being no potential benefit from it.\" She suggested that one way forward would be to run trials of \"watchful waiting\", which happens in suspected cases of prostate cancer \u2013 so that surgery does not take place until it is definitely needed. Klim McPherson, visiting professor in public health epidemiology at Oxford University who specialises in women's health, said women need to be given better information about the risks as well as the benefits so that they can make an informed decision on whether to go for screening. But because there is concern in the UK that people do not go to the GP early enough when they suspect they might have cancer, he said, \"the massive juggernaut called screening is aimed at getting the population hooked into the idea that early diagnosis is better\". Prof Julietta Patnick, director of the NHS cancer screening programmes, said mammograms saved lives. \"By bringing forward detection and diagnosis, screening helps us find those cancers that would otherwise not be caught until later in life, by which time they could be fatal. Some over-diagnosis does inevitably occur, but in much lower numbers in England than suggested by these authors. \"It is important to realise that it is impossible to predict which cancers will progress, or how quickly. This requires further investigations, like a biopsy. Ultimately, screening is about striking the right balance of risk and benefit, based on the best research available. Research published in 2010 concluded that between 2 and 2.5 lives are saved for every over-diagnosed case of breast cancer.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
