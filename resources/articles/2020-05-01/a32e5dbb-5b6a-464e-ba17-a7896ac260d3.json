It will be our own fault now because the government warned us, and we let our guard down. But in the beforetimes, the objects of our readiness to duck and cover, flee or fight, were more tangible. From 1979 to 1990, it was the sight or sound of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 an enemy almost as unifying as the coronavirus \u2013 that had many of us on a hair-trigger. And you were free to cultivate your own, more idiosyncratic, alarm systems, too. You could stay alert to fancy-dress party invitations, for example, raisins in chocolate or people who said \u201cfrom myself\u201d instead of \u201cfrom me\u201d, and shield yourself accordingly. For me, it was always Things Starring One Actor As Twins. Such endeavours are catnip to actors and, if you give most of them an inch, they will take a mile. When playing twins, the potential for excess is more than doubled; there are the part(s) and the fact that the piece then stands or falls by one semi-lunatic\u2019s performance. (All actors are semi-lunatics. Don\u2019t worry. They know and accept, nay revel in, this.) The urge to excess is great. It takes a strong personality \u2013 or an even stronger director \u2013 not to let them go hog-wild with the opportunity. All hail, then, Mark Ruffalo in the new, 90s-set HBO drama I Know This Much Is True on Sky Atlantic, in which he plays the 40-year-old twin brothers Dominick and Thomas Birdsey. Thomas has paranoid schizophrenia, and has been more in than out of state hospitals for 20 years; Dominick is bound to him by ties of love and duty, abraded by resentment, grief and fatigue. They are both the product of a home dominated by a violent stepfather, and labouring under the loss of their mother three years previously from breast cancer. She never told them who their father was, but left Dominick the unread manuscript of her Sicilian father\u2019s autobiography, whose secrets are revealed in flashback as the series goes on. We open with a grisly, but not gratuitous, scene. Convinced that a personal sacrifice will end the ongoing Gulf war, Thomas hacks off his own hand in a public library. Thereafter, the six-part, six-hour-long series (adapted from a 900-page 1998 bestseller of the same name) starts to fold in tighter and tighter upon itself, becoming more of a mood piece than melodrama. It is an approach that might have paid greater dividends at shorter length because, while the exact point will vary for each viewer, few will avoid compassion fatigue setting in, as the tale of the brothers\u2019 relentless suffering goes on. Perhaps this is a perfect reflection of life with chronic mental illness and of caring for someone with such a condition. But art is not life, and you need to guard against the law of diminishing returns. After the library \u201cincident\u201d, Thomas is relocated to a high-security psychiatric prison, and Dominick must draw once more on his waning emotional resources to fight against those who, as he sees it at least, do not have his brother\u2019s best interests at heart. While that story unfolds in the drama\u2019s present, Dominick\u2019s suffering continues as his childhood and more recent past unfold in memory and (slightly ponderous) voiceover. He and his wife separated and divorced after the sudden death of their baby daughter. We see how the early years of suppressing his feelings and frustrations in a violent household, and then subsuming his needs beneath those of his brother as an adult, have left him unable to express himself, however dire the circumstances. His current, much younger, girlfriend has no patience with his unwillingness to pay her more than a fraction of the attention he does to Thomas, and they scream at each other across a gulf of misunderstanding and need. It is heavy stuff. There is little light and shade, and no wider, deeper commentary to be had. It is a modern-day Job\u2019s suffering examined in careful but ultimately unilluminating detail. The strength of all the performances \u2013 Ruffalo\u2019s of course, but also Kathryn Hahn as his still-loving ex-wife, Rob Huebel as her new partner and Dominick\u2019s friend, Melissa Leo as the twins\u2019 downtrodden mother (Leo is only nine years older than her supposed offspring, but that is a column for another time), and Archie Panjabi as Thomas\u2019s new psychiatrist \u2013 makes it worth watching. But any averagely empathic person will already know all the truth that is to be found here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
