The figure rises to 65% among parents who have already identified their child as being overweight, suggesting that by avoiding the problem families are contributing to an increasingly obese society, a health group warns. The survey was conducted by the social enterprise Mend and the online community Netmums for national childhood obesity week. More than 1,000 parents with a child aged 5-16 responded to the survey on Netmums about how they felt bringing up the topic of weight with their child. It found that 37% said they feared that talking to their child about their weight might lower their self-esteem, 42% of parents had attempted to talk about the issue, and almost half of parents who had an overweight or obese child said it was an unhelpful experience for the family. Three-quarters of parents said they often talked to their children about what they eat, such as telling them to eat less junk food and eat more fruit and vegetables. More than a third of parents estimated their child's weight by looking at them or comparing them with other children their age, rather than taking measurements or seeing a doctor. Mend runs weight-loss programmes for overweight children and adults with NHS partners, but has warned it is in limbo because of funding cuts and confusion over the government's policy of handing responsibility for public health to local authorities. Paul Sacher, Mend's co-founder and chief research and development officer, said: \"With obesity reaching epidemic proportions and becoming the norm, it can be very difficult for parents to tell if their child is a healthy weight simply by looking at them. The easiest way to check if your child is a healthy weight or not is to measure their weight and height and then to use an online BMI calculator.\" The Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: \"Tackling the issue of children's weight is a growing problem and it's concerning a third of parents are avoiding the issue for fear of lowering their child's self-esteem. Every parent wants the best for their child and although initially it may be a tough conversation to have, the family talking together and working together to find healthier ways of eating will lead to happier and healthier children.\" In May a parliamentary report warned that girls as young as five routinely worried about their weight and appearance, and more than half the UK population was grappling with mental and physical problems relating to negative body image. The pressure to achieve an unrealistic \"body ideal\" is now an underlying cause of serious health and relationship problems, according to the study from the all-party parliamentary group on body image."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
