Trump said in a statement that the updated investigation into his nominee for America\u2019s highest bench \u201cmust be limited in scope\u201d and \u201ccompleted in less than one week\u201d. However, he later suggested in a tweet that it was only a matter of time before Kavanaugh was appointed. Senate Republicans voted to advance Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination despite a last-minute change of heart by a Republican senator, who broke ranks and called for an FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations that have roiled the judge\u2019s confirmation process. Moments before the Senate judiciary committee voted 11-10, along strict party lines, to send Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the floor for the full chamber\u2019s consideration, Senator Jeff Flake announced he would support a \u201climited\u201d FBI investigation and threatened to oppose Kavanaugh if there was no further examination of the allegations against him. \u201cI think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to and not more than one week in order to let the FBI do an investigation,\u201d Flake said at the hearing on Friday. Following Flake\u2019s insistence, the Senate judiciary committee later said it was formally requesting that the Trump administration instruct the FBI to conduct a supplemental background investigation that would be \u201climited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today\u201d. The decision marks a reversal for the administration, which had argued that Kavanaugh had already been vetted. The remarkable turnaround came hours after Flake announced his support for Kavanaugh despite dramatic testimony on Thursday that saw the supreme court nominee and Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who accused him of sexual assault, deliver dueling testimony on Capitol Hill. Flake, who had been regarded as a crucial swing vote, reversed course after he was confronted by two survivors of sexual assault in an elevator shortly before Friday\u2019s committee vote. The confrontation with Flake could be seen in TV footage blocking the Arizona senator from closing the elevator door. Through her tears, one woman said she had been a victim of sexual assault, and begged Flake to look her in the eye. She said: \u201cLook at me and tell me that it doesn\u2019t matter what happened to me.\u201d The gripping exchange appeared to have had an impact on Flake, who subsequently sat stone-faced in the committee room in anticipation of the vote. As his Republican colleagues took turns declaring their support for Kavanaugh, Flake abruptly left the room to engage in private discussions with Democrats on the committee. Nearly an hour of tense, closed-door deliberations followed, pushing the vote past its scheduled time. As members exited and re-entered the room several times, seeking to make sense of what was transpiring behind-the-scenes, Flake finally re-emerged before the committee and voiced support delaying a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh pending a FBI investigation. \u201cWe can have a short pause and make sure the FBI can investigate,\u201d he said. During Thursday\u2019s hearing, Ford recounted how Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when the two were teenagers in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the charge from Ford, who testified to lawmakers under oath that she was \u201c100%\u201d sure he assaulted her. According to her lawyer, Ford welcomed the FBI investigation, but said \u201cno artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on it\u201d. Kavanaugh said he had done \u201ceverything\u201d the Senate had asked of him and \u201cwill continue to cooperate.\u201d Thursday\u2019s emotionally charged hearing underscored not only the potential ramifications of sending Kavanaugh to the supreme court, where he would play a role in shaping decades\u2019 worth of policy, but also the societal impact of the #MeToo movement and recourse for victims of sexual assault. It remains unclear if Republicans possess the necessary votes from the full chamber to confirm Kavanaugh. With a narrow 51-49 seat majority in the Senate, Republicans can afford to lose just one vote. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two of the Senate\u2019s prominent Republican women, have remained undecided on Kavanaugh. Both senators on Friday afternoon expressed support for a limited FBI investigation following the committee\u2019s announcement that it would seek one. Speaking to reporters earlier on Friday, Trump said he had not considered an alternative to Kavanaugh. But he did not escalate pressure on Senate Republicans to rally behind his nominee, stating: \u201cThey have to do what they think is right.\u201d Also earlier in the day, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, had dismissed calls for a new FBI investigation, telling reporters Kavanaugh had already \u201cbeen through six separate background investigations by the FBI\u201d. Kavanaugh is a darling of the conservative right in America but his path to the supreme court has been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations from three women. Democrats have called for Kavanaugh to withdraw as more accusers have come forward. Following Kavanaugh\u2019s fiery testimony on Thursday, several Democrats voiced concerns over his suitability for the historically independent supreme court. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the judiciary committee\u2019s top Democrat, said the judge had been \u201caggressive and belligerent\u201d. \u201cI have never seen someone who wanted to be elevated to the highest court in our country behave in that manner,\u201d she said. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, lamented the committee was no longer independent. He said: \u201cWe are an arm, and a very weak arm, of the Trump White House.\u201d Red-state Democrats facing tough re-election battles in November, some of whom crossed over the aisle last year to confirm Trump\u2019s other supreme court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, also appeared to feel the heat. At least two of them, Senators Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, announced they would vote against Kavanaugh on Friday. \u201cAs I have made clear before, sexual assault has no place in our society,\u201d Donnelly said in a statement. \u201cWhen it does occur, we should listen to the survivors and work to ensure it never happens again. That should not be a partisan issue.\u201d Joe Manchin, a vulnerable Democrat up for re-election in West Virginia, endorsed Flake\u2019s position. Meanwhile, there were signs the remarkable testimony had registered negatively with at least two organizations whose endorsement Kavanaugh had earlier received. The American Bar Association, which previously gave Kavanaugh its highest rating of \u201cwell qualified\u201d, asked the Senate judiciary committee and the full Senate to delay the vote until the FBI could do a full background check."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
