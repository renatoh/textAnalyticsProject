The London gallery announced details on Wednesday of what will be the UK\u2019s most comprehensive exhibition devoted to bags, opening in April and running for nine months. Thatcher would not have been Thatcher without her handbags. Her biographer Charles Moore called it a \u201csceptre of her rule\u201d and others have described them as part of her \u201cIron Lady\u201d armoury, her secret weapon with which to deliver stern \u201chandbaggings\u201d to some of the men in her cabinet. When the show was first revealed in July the curators expressed a desire to borrow a Thatcher bag because none were in its collections of her outfits. It has now secured a loan from the Museum of Bags, in Amsterdam, of a grey Asprey bag which was made in the early 1980s and regularly carried by her while in power. The museum does have examples of her clothes, donated in 2016 by Thatcher\u2019s twin children Carol and Mark \u2013 power dressing ensembles which include a royal-blue Aquascutum suit with shoulder pads and a matching blouse that she wore as she voted in the 1987 election. That donation followed a row when the museum was accused of turning down an offer of her clothes. It later denied rejecting them. Its chairman, Nicholas Coleridge, insisted there was \u201cno letter, no meeting, no judgment \u2026 no overture of any kind\u201d. The dust on that row has long settled and the Thatcher handbag will be a star of a show exploring what the V&amp;A calls \u201cthe ultimate accessory\u201d. The show\u2019s curator, Lucia Savi, said the exhibition would offer \u201can understanding and insight into the function, status, design and making of bags across the world and throughout history\u201d. Different visitors will be excited by different stories. Some will enjoy seeing a second world war gas mask bag, which belonged to Queen Mary. Others will thrill at seeing the purple Fendi Baguette bag worn by Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s Carrie Bradshaw character in Sex and the City, a bag memorably taken from her at gunpoint: \u201cGive me your bag,\u201d says the robber. \u201cIt\u2019s a Baguette,\u201d she corrects him, mournfully. In total, more than 300 objects will go on display, varying in size from tiny finger purses to large travel trunks. Celebrity endorsement will be explored with a Louis Vuitton bag, designed by Marc Jacobs and made from gold reflective vinyl popularised by Hilton and Kardashian during the \u201cit bag\u201d craze of the early 2000s. \u2022 Bags: Inside Out runs at the V&amp;A from 25 April 2020 to 31 January 2021"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
