That's a good innings for a day on the internet", "bodyText": "It was the kind of court case that could not have happened 10, five or even three years ago: an internet troll charged over offensive comments he\u2019d made in response to a Facebook post of a screenshot of a Tinder profile quoting a Drake lyric. \u201cJust before we get started,\u201d said the judge as he entered the courtroom, holding a thick sheath of paper on which tens, if not hundreds of comments made by the defendant and others were printed, \u201cwhat is \u2018inboxing\u2019?\u201d There was a pause. The counsel for the defence responded to the best of her ability. \u201cThe inbox is where you get your messages on Facebook.\u201d From this inauspicious start, Zane Alchin \u2013 charged over 55 comments he had made in the course of two hours on Facebook in August 2015, several of which referred explicitly to rape \u2013 was convicted of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend. On paper it was a victory for the anti-trolling movement. Despite its prevalence \u2013 according to the UN nearly three in four women have witnessed or experienced some form of \u201ccyber violence\u201d \u2013 charges are rarely laid over online abuse. Paloma Brierley Newton, the complainant to whom Alchin had addressed many of his comments, had first overcome hurdles to report them to police then kept the momentum with a media campaign. Even reaching the point of sentencing, nearly a year later, felt like an achievement. But in the courtroom there was no sense of a wrong being righted \u2013 only reminder after reminder of why, for every Alchin, there will be those who never see justice. From the outset, it was clear that the platform itself posed a problem. In general, talking about online dialogue is fraught with difficulty, and this case demanded a lot of it. It asked the questions: What might compel a young woman to describe herself as the \u201ctype of girl to suck you dry then eat some lunch with you\u201d? Why would a man go out of his way to make fun of a stranger to his own Facebook friends and followers? Why would someone post publicly, repeatedly, quite specifically about rape and sexual violence? The sentencing judge, magistrate William Pierce, had read the sprawling comment thread for the first time less than an hour before entering the courtroom. He remarked on the \u201chuge number\u201d of posts, as well as the \u201cnumber\u201d by Brierley Newton, and the \u201csomewhat inflammatory ... sexual nature\u201d of the Tinder bio that sparked it all. I\u2019d watched the \u201cflame fight\u201d, as the lawyer termed it, unfurl on Facebook in August last year, months before Alchin was charged. There were likes. There were shares. There were comments and screengrabs and blocks and all the creation and curation of content that goes on when it goes down online. Even if you were very familiar with the facts, it was difficult to follow, and compounding the problem was a generation gap. Played out anew in a courtroom nearly a year later, it demanded his defence lawyer explain the internet. We heard the definitions of \u201cOMG\u201d and \u201cIRL\u201d and \u201cfuckboi\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe equivalent of calling girls \u2018slut\u2019,\u201d she said. (\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d hissed a reporter next to me.) The fact that women were called \u201c\u2018basic bitches\u2019, several times\u201d was held up as an indicator of the \u201clevel of conversation\u201d. Seemingly more by accident than design, in the retelling Alchin\u2019s comments became the worst of a bad bunch \u2013 not simply \u201coffensive\u201d but violent, misogynistic, persistent. The fact that he\u2019d posted 55 times in two hours, often singling out an individual, and the explicitness, the specificity with which he\u2019d addressed her seemed to get lost in the he-said, she-said. In the comments reported in the police fact sheet and Brierley Newton\u2019s victim impact statement \u2013 not even a complete account of what he posted \u2013 Alchin had made graphic, violent references to rape and sexual violence. No one \u2013 not the police, not even Brierley Newton \u2013 had truly believed that Alchin intended to rape her. But the fact that it had occurred to him to reference it, or the possibility that it communicated something about his attitude towards women, was not raised in the courtroom at all. To quote his defence lawyer: Alchin was simply \u201cbeing deliberately offensive to others\u201d. Pierce said his comments were \u201csexually explicit ... quite disgusting ... deliberately offensive\u201d \u2013 but that he had not threatened or incited rape. The incident was spoken of, by both his defence lawyer and Pierce, as a social media block war in which Alchin had undeniably overstepped the line but in which no one had been blameless, and from which he had not escaped scot-free, even before charges were laid. Alchin had experienced \u201csignificant extra-curial punishment\u201d, said Pierce, citing a \u201cvast overreaction\u201d from others involved, including Brierley Newton, and the threats and harassment he had received from her supporters. Media coverage, it was implied, was part of that punishment. But some of Alchin\u2019s comments had gone \u201ca bit far\u201d. In his summing up, Pierce told Alchin that \u201cbefore the days of Facebook\u201d \u2013 simpler, better days it was implied \u2013 the charge of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend had been applied to boyfriends threatening their girlfriends over the phone. It was a \u201cunilateral thing\u201d, he said. With the \u201cwhirling maelstrom of hate\u201d on the internet, a \u201cfew mildly explicit comments\u201d was the price of entry. Actually, he used the analogy of a sports game: \u201cif you\u2019re on the football field, you consent to a few bumps\u201d. The week before the sentencing, I had been tweeted at by a man identified only as John. I\u2019d never encountered him before. He told me that he hoped I was raped and beheaded, \u201cnot necessarily in that order either ;)\u201d. It didn\u2019t occur to me to even block him, let alone report him to the police. (Merely \u201choping\u201d I get raped probably doesn\u2019t equate to a threat, anyway.) It was a one-off; he was a faceless \u201cegg\u201d account. It\u2019s still active on his profile, the most recent tweet he sent. I didn\u2019t consent to a few bumps, but I\u2019ve accepted that they happen. Brierley Newton had chosen not to. She was in tears when she left the courtroom. Ending online abuse has in part been discussed as a criminal justice issue: how to hold perpetrators accountable under the law. When simply identifying them is difficult, a charge is an achievement; a conviction is a win. This felt like more of a concession \u2013 that a couple of references to rape is a good innings for a day on the internet, that we have to tolerate someone who sets out to be \u201cdeliberately offensive\u201d, that we can\u2019t clean up the web. And if the courts write off the issue of online abuse, we can expect those \u201cbumps\u201d to get bigger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
