There are, of course, dozens of countries where these civilised rules do not apply, so it was heartening to note a small flurry of cases this week in which individual freedom defeated social oppression. First, Russia, a country where it is easy to find justice spiralling away from you if you fall foul of the wrong people. The journalist Ivan Golunov looked like becoming the latest victim \u2013 until a rare national outpouring of solidarity reminded the authorities that injustice can be dangerous for those who mete it out too. Botswana has little in common with Russia, apart from a lot of diamonds and a lingering prejudice against homosexuality. But this week, as Jason Burke reported, judges ruled that laws criminalising same-sex relations should be struck down. And while we are talking about LGBT rights, Ecuador legalised same-sex marriage, and Amrit Dhillon caught up with the inspiring Indian Olympian blazing a trail for homosexuality in a conservative country. It is not all plain sailing, however, as the situations in Hong Kong, Hungary, Sudan and Ethiopia demonstrated this week \u2026 Lucky numbers There were more encouraging environment statistics showing the UK used less fossil fuel than ever to power its energy grid this winter. And a big Thomson Reuters report found growing numbers of people are moving to trustworthy news brands because of concerns about information bandits, charlatans and fakers. What we liked The marathon runner saved by strangers on the finishing line. And also on the subject of rescuing people, the simple school multiple choice questionnaire that saved vulnerable children. What we heard There was a flurry of responses to Stephen Burgen\u2019s article about the Spanish restaurant served exclusively by people with disabilities. Leslie Yerington pointed out the work of the Lucy Foundation, a social enterprise \u2013 named after a false leg - that tries to empower and include people with all kinds of disabilities. Georgie Cottini wrote about the work of Beresford Street Kitchen in Jersey, which provides training and employment for people with learning disabilities and autism. We have a cafe, print shop and catering outlet in Jersey Channel Islands doing exactly the same thing! In your article you mentioned other places in Europe doing similar things so it would be great to mention one in this country! Paul De Maeyer wrote from Rome to point out a chocolate shop in Campania, Italy, that employs people with Down\u2019s syndrome (this article is in Italian). The villa in which the chocolate laboratory \u2018Dulcis in fundo\u2019 is situated, was seized from the Camorra (local mafia). Where was the Upside? In Buckfastleigh, Devon, where locals have mounted a quiet, very English sort of revolution. Also, on public transport across the UK, where a BBC-inspired movement sought to get strangers to talk to each other to combat polarisation and isolation.
