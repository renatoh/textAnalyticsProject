Change the way you cogitate and you could come up with some surprises, particularly when it comes to finding a satisfying career. \"Typical ways of thinking tend to be system based. You think of something that leads on to something else,\" says Howard Khan, senior lecturer at Heriot Watt University's School of Management. \"Lateral thinking is used where we want to be creative. The idea is to escape from the way we normally think to develop original solutions to problems.\" And he believes it might be helpful when choosing a job. It's something that Charles Miller used when making a career change. Having studied engineering at Reading University his course specialised in construction management and building services design. \"I was offered a job with a consulting engineer during my final year. I wouldn't say I was overly enthusiastic about it but I was very pleased about getting a job so soon.\" But 18 months went by and he realised he didn't want to be doing the same thing when he was 30. Charles decided to think about things a little differently. Rather than focusing on his degree he looked at his interests and skills. \"When I was at school I did enjoy maths and doing the calculations. From a younger age I was always interested in economics and the stock market.\" It didn't take long to work out that this might be an interesting direction to go in. He is now a futures trader with Financial Market Engineering using his mathematical ability to the full. Thinking beyond the conventional, looking at things from a different angle can be very useful, says Dr Binna Kandola of occupational psychologist Pearn Kandola. \"When people start thinking about careers they tend to think along fairly traditional lines and look at professions like accountancy, law, medicine, engineering. But beyond that is a whole world of work which only really becomes apparent when you are actually working.\" To avoid the more obvious careers, Binna suggests steering clear of specific job ideas. Instead, consider the characteristics you would want to find in your ideal role. \"Would you like a job that involves working indoors or outdoors, involves a lot of people or working on your own? Must it involve IT or animals? That's the starting point,\" he says. \"And then you find out what type of jobs fulfill as many of these criteria as possible. Once you've got an initial list you can double that by looking for jobs that aren't immediately obvious.\" Howard Kahn suggests another practical exercise using a fish bone diagram. Draw a fish skeleton with a lot of bones protruding from the main spine. \"At the end of each fish bone write what you are good at. You now have a picture of your strengths. By looking at that, you might be able to determine what combination is best for you and thus what career you might move into,\" he says. Some jobs, however, would be impossible to find and, as Binna Kandola suggests, only become apparent once you're inside a company. \"I would never have anticipated having a job I loved so much,\" says Sarah Greenfield who is creative researcher at Getty Images, a photo-library service. \"It has made me realise that if you want something enough and work hard enough then you really can get the job of your dreams. And although the university experience is very useful, the degree you choose doesn't have to significantly effect your future career path at all.\" Having a degree in English and history, she originally planned to go into journalism. But, after hearing about Getty Images from a friend, she found a job in their sales department concentrating on magazine and newspaper clients. However, it was three years before her current role came up. \"The key to my job is observation. It involves a great deal of time scanning world media and pinpointing the interesting pieces and facts that lead to trends which in turn lead to future images,\" she says. Sarah also predicts trends and suggests picture ideas that she thinks Getty's clients will need in the future. \"I feel very lucky to have the job I do,\" she says. But finding the job of your choice is more about altering your thinking strategies than it is about luck. \"It's thinking about the non-obvious solutions,\" says Binna Kandola. And who knows what job might pop up if you think about your skills in a non-obvious way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
