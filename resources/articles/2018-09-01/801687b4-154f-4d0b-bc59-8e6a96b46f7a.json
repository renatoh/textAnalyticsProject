The committee says the price of non-intervention in the seven-year civil war has been unacceptably high in terms of lost lives, increased Russian and Iranian influence and severe consequences for Europe. The call for an inquiry comes in a report issued on Monday, as Russia prepares a major offensive in the last rebel enlcave of Idlib. The idea of a Chilcot-style inquiry has already been rejected by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in a letter to the committee in which he argued that the reasons for the UK\u2019s non-intervention were well documented. But the report urges the government to clarify its approach to the UN doctrine of the responsibility to protect, arguing: \u201cWhile the cost, complexities and challenges of intervening have been well documented through previous inquiries, such as the Iraq inquiry, the consequences of not acting are less well understood. We believe that the consequences of inaction can be every bit as serious as intervening. The decision not to intervene in Syria has had very real consequences for Syrians, their neighbours, the UK and our allies.\u201d MPs in 2013 voted not to back military action after Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces used chemical weapons in eastern Damascus. The vote contributed to Barack Obama\u2019s decision to hold back from enforcing his red line on the use of chemical weapons. But the MPs say an inquiry needs to examine more than the circumstances of the Commons vote in August 2013 and to look more broadly into the devastating consequences of the international community\u2019s failure to act both for Syrian refugees, chemical weapons use, the politics of the Middle East and relations between Russia and the west, including at UN security council. They write: \u201cThere has been a manifest failure to protect civilians and to prevent mass atrocity crimes in Syria. This failure has gone beyond the heavy toll paid by the Syrian people to the surrounding region, and had repercussions in Europe and the UK. It is the committee\u2019s view that this failure derives principally not from the actions taken by the international community but inaction. \u201cThe international community\u2019s inaction created an opportunity for others, particularly Russia and Iran, to intervene, changing the politics of the conflict in Syria. We believe the government needs to understand the role the UK\u2019s inaction has had and learn the lessons from it for the future.\u201d By only responding to chemcial weapon attacks and ignoring the Syrian government\u2019s use of barrel bombs on civilian populations, the west was in danger of creating \u201ca hierarchy of atrocities\u201d in which only the most severe warrant response, the MPs add. The committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, said: \u201cThe people of Syria show clearly that choosing not to act, standing aside, can have consequences every bit as real and horrific as the decision to act. The government must do more to protect civilians as part of its responsibility to protect. With the situation in Idlib reaching crisis point, action to prevent mass atrocities is ever more urgent.\u201d The MPs also urge the UK government to define more clearly its belief in the right to intervene militarily to prevent genocide or atrocities. The report admits deep divisions exist about the legality of military intervention on humanitarian grounds, including whether it is prohibited by the UN charter or by the principles of national sovereignty. The report argues that the creators of the UN charter would not have sought to prohibit interventions designed to protect population from atrocities. The report also calls on the UK to urge UN security council members to agree to refrain from using their veto in the event of credible allegations of genocide, a proposal advanced by the then-French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2013, but unlikely to gain Russian support. The committee blames Russia for using its UN veto repeatedly in Syria, saying: \u201cIt is an abuse of the moral responsibility entrusted to the permanent security council members to block action sought to prevent or alleviate suffering from mass atrocities.\u201d The MPs argue: \u201cUnder specific circumstances, proportionate and necessary force should be available to be used as a last resort to alleviate extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale. \u201cThe absence of humanitarian intervention as a final recourse could result in the paralysis of the international system and a failure to act, resulting in grave consequences for civilian populations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
